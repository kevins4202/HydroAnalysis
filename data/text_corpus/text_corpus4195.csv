20975,this paper presents the results of a series of laboratory studies to explore the effects of water flow on the bearing capacity of monopiles in sand the load displacement relationship axial force normalized bending moment of the pile shaft the p y curves and the bearing envelope are obtained to quantify the effect of water flow on the bearing capacity of the monopile the results demonstrate that water flow can result in a maximum scouring depth of 0 7 d pile diameter which reduces the lateral bearing capacity by about 4 10 it is also found that the bearing capacity of the pile for resisting eccentric lateral load equals to moment and horizontal loads at mudline slightly increases at the initial stage with the rise of the applied vertical load finally the bearing capacity envelopes of pile with and without water flow are proposed which can provide guidance for the design of monopiles keywords large diameter monopile water flow vertical load bearing capacity model tests 1 introduction 1 1 conception large diameter monopiles are one of the most commonly used foundations for offshore wind turbines owt due to its relatively low installation costs and enough load bearing capacity in shallow sea areas with water depth less than 30 m leblanc et al 2010 achmus et al 2009 doherty and gavin 2012 to improve energy production owt projects are moving from near coast within 30 m depth to deeper waters and larger superstructure of wind turbine 10 mw and above electricity output is being designed and constructed larger size monopiles are therefore used to support the taller wind turbine towers and larger dimensions of the rotor blades and nacelle monopile foundations would be exposed to a greater magnitude of lateral loads caused by wind ocean waves and currents etc and a larger vertical load from superstructure simultaneously for such a large size monopile the interaction between monopile and fluids becomes significant where the lateral movement of water can apply drag force to the monopile resulting in structural vibration as well as causing scouring to the surrounding soil near the monopile which affect the load bearing capacity of the monopile foundation see in fig 1 therefore it is necessary to properly understand the behavior of monopile foundation system for wind turbine using in deep water environment that is subjected to complex loading conditions 1 2 previous work previous studies employed experimental and numerical methods to investigate the behavior of piles under combined vertical v and eccentric lateral loads h m i e horizontal and moment loadings in sand clay or in site soil conditions table 1 summarizes existing studies under combined vertical and eccentric lateral loading conditions v h m loadings there is still no agreement on whether the vertical load would increase or weaken the eccentric lateral load bearing capacity of pile shafts nevertheless it is commonly believed that the effect of vertical load on the lateral load bearing capacity of the pile is related to soil types i e when the pile is in sand a higher vertical load level is found to increase the lateral load bearing capacity but when the pile is in clay vertical load is found to have adverse effect to the lateral load bearing capacity of the pile karthigeyan et al 2007 babu et al 2016 hazzar et al 2017 for offshore foundation application with large diameter steel pipe piles haiderali et al 2013 found that the level of vertical load applied to the pile has only minor weakening effect on the ultimate lateral load bearing capacity however all those researches were mainly based on analysis of pile soil stress state the influence of fluid and the interaction between water and pile is rarely considered despite the absolute value of water pressure act on the pile shaft is relatively small scouring effect around piles could be developed when the current velocity near the mud surface exceeds the threshold of sediment transportation which results in a decrease of the embedded depth of pile and a reduction of the bearing capacity of pile kishore et al 2009 meanwhile since the scour depth is related to the diameter of pile scouring effect has a great impact on piles with large diameter and small length diameter ratio in consideration to this phenomenon the mechanism of scouring around large diameter piles and prediction of maximum scouring depth have attracted much attention at the moment the commonly accepted methods for predicting local scouring depth include breusers et al 1977 sumer and fredsøe 2002 and the method in hydraulic engineering circular no 18 hec 18 of the federal highway administration of the united states richardson and davis 2001 etc but understanding on the impact of scouring effect to the lateral load bearing capacity of monopile is still limited some researchers carried out theoretical analysis and employed laboratory test using dig out soils around piles to correct the p y curve of the laterally loaded pile after scouring lin et al 2010 2016 numerical studies were also conducted to study the effects of depth width and slope angle of the scour hole on the lateral load bearing capacity of piles li et al 2013 lin et al 2014 2016 some laboratory tests were used to study the influence of scouring on the lateral load bearing capacity of monopiles reese et al 1989 kishore et al 2009 qi et al 2016 it was also found that apart from scouring flow field around the pile could be seriously disturbed due to the pile and fluid interaction the downward flow and the horseshoe vortex were found to form in front of the pile and the streamlines on both sides of the pile shaft shrink along the direction of water flow meanwhile as the water flow generates vortex behind the pile resulting in a turbulence flow field around the pile in such a turbulence flow field the change of the instantaneous water pressure acting on the pile shaft becomes very complicated in both time and space domains the vortex induced vibration is therefore developed and the stability of the pile is affected to date limited study is available on the influence of water flow to the lateral response of a pile most of existing studies were conducted in an environment without consideration of water flow in order to fully understand the influence of water flow on the load bearing capacity of a pile and establish an accurate prediction model of the load bearing capacity of large diameter monopiles it is necessary to thoroughly understanding the mechanism and behavior of monopiles in water condition through properly designed experimental research in this study a series of 1 g model tests are conducted on large diameter monopile foundation in sand subjected with v h combing loading the model is installed in underwater condition the influence of water flow with scouring effect on the load bearing capacity of monopiles are quantified which provide a guidance for the design of offshore monopile foundations 2 theory and methodology 2 1 scaling laws for model test laboratory model test can be scalable to predict the in site load bearing behavior of a full scale monopile prototype detailed scaling laws for model tests of offshore monopile foundations were reported by leblanc et al 2010 bhattacharya et al 2011 and cuéllar et al 2012 since the behavior of owt is a very complex problem that involves pile soil interaction aerodynamics between wind turbine and air and fluid dynamics around the monopile between pile shaft and water fluid dozens of parameters are involved in the scaling laws in the current study the laboratory model is referring to an offshore monopile prototype with a diameter of 6 m a wall thickness of 0 06 m and an embedded depth of 45 m or 36 m a model reducing scale λ of 1 100 is employed detailed scaling laws between the model pile and prototypes are listed in table 2 it is worth noting that certain parameters such as the wall thickness and flexural stiffness of piles do not strictly follow the ratio of 1 100 because of modeling limitation and material availability nevertheless these parameters are considered to be none critical parameters which would therefore not significantly affect test results it is believed that the model tests could reasonably capture the primary characteristics of the in situ conditions of the monopile under water environment 2 2 test device fig 2 illustrates the test system to simulate a monopile foundation subjected to combined vertical lateral loads as well as under the action of water flow in the marine environment an experimental flume 5 8 m in length 0 48 m in width and 0 5 m in depth made of toughened glass and steel frame is used in this study it includes a sunken soil trough laying in the middle of the flume 1 4 m in length 0 48 m in width 0 7 m in depth to deposit the sand the top of the soil is levelled with the bottom of the flume the flume also comprises of 1 a pile loading and deformation monitoring system and 2 a water flow simulation and monitoring system 2 2 1 pile loading and deformation monitoring system a hollow circular tube made of pmma plexiglass is used as the model pile in this test fig 2 c it has a total length of 1000 mm including an embedded section a submerged section of the pile shaft and a transition section of the pile to tower an external diameter d of 60 mm a wall thickness t of 2 mm and an elastic modulus e p of 3 02 gpa the external surface of the pile is sanded along 45 circumferential direction using sandpaper 60 to increase the roughness of the pile which best complies to the in situ engineering practice the bottom of the model pile is sealed with a solid conical block 8 mm long pvc shell filled with c30 concrete a total of 9 pairs of strain gauges are installed to the external surface of the pile the red square in fig 2 c the wires of the strain gauges are installed through the pre punched holes 3 mm in diameter inside the pile epoxy resin is used to protection the strain gauges and also to provide waterproofing the strains due to pile bending are measured in each group of the tests two piles are installed as shown in fig 2 b to prevent interference of piles and to eliminate the influence of boundary conditions the piles are positioned as far away as possible between each other and from the flume wall the distance between the two piles and that between the pile and the boundary wall exceed 7 times the diameters in the longitudinal direction and 3 time the diameters in the transverse nogami and novak 1977 davisson 1970 to properly consider the pile fluid interaction and minimize the influence of boundary condition 3 times the diameters is a proper distance between piles to the side wall of the flume li et al 2015 following leblanc et al 2010 when applying vertical load a cushion layer below the pile tip is maintained that exceeds 4 times the diameters of piles so as to eliminate the influence of bottom boundary the lateral load acting on the pile shaft is applied through a pneumatic cylinder which is installed on a triangle reaction frame on the side wall of the flume the loading point is at an elevation of 360 mm above the mudline a load cell is attached to the cylinder rod to measure the applied lateral force a pivot is installed at end of the loading rod allowing rotation of the pile which ensures the loading direction remains horizontal after the pile shaft is inclined to avoid any vibration interference from water flow to the displacement measurement a shelf for displacement sensor is installed that is independent of the flume system two laterally mounted laser sensors are attached to the shelf to measure the lateral deformation of the pile i e one at the same height of the loading point and the other at 100 mm below the loading point in addition a vertically placed pneumatic cylinder is installed to apply the vertical load on the pile head the vertical settlement of the pile is measured by a third laser sensor which is installed paralleled with the pile axis the vertical and lateral responses of the model pile are measured by the slow maintenance loading method in which the displacement time histories are recorded every 5 min and the change of displacement less or equal to 0 01 mm 5 min are taken as the stability criterion for each loading level the ultimate vertical load bearing capacity v ult of the pile is taken as the load corresponding to a settlement of 0 03d davisson 1972 ng et al 2004 for combined loading the swipe method proposed by tan 1990 is used where a vertical load is applied to the pile head by stacking weights first and then the currents and lateral load are applied 2 2 2 simulation of water flow a pump system is used to generate the circulating one way water flow in the flume a square hole grille block length 0 3 m width 0 5 m and depth 0 4 m see in fig 2 is placed at 1 m away from the inlet side of the flume to straighten the direction of water flow as far as possible to minimize the turbulence the grille block is assembled from a plurality of square tubes with a side of 0 05 m and length of 0 3 m horizontal and parallel to the direction of water flow the velocities of the water flow u c are measured by an acoustic doppler velocimeter adv which is installed at 10d in front of the model pile and the distribution of u c along water depth can be obtained by adjusting the height of the detector to study the effect of water flow and vertical load on the lateral response of piles a series of tests are carried out at a constant water depth of 200 mm the velocity of water flow at the upstream 10d of the pile in the flume is designed according to the scaling laws and collected by the detector as shown in fig 3 the velocity distribution is found to be approximately trapezoidal along the water depth the drag force acting on the pile is estimated first during the flow of water lateral drag load is generated on the submerged section of the pile shaft the lateral drag load can be calculating by eq 1 as 1 f 1 2 c d ρ w a p 0 h u c 2 d h where c d 1 2 is the drag coefficient of the water flow ρ w 1000 kg m3 is the density of water a p is the projected area of unit pile length perpendicular to the direction of water flow and h is the water depth the drag load of the applied water flow on the pile shaft is approximately 0 8 n following eq 1 2 3 soil preparation and mechanical parameters the sand for embedding model piles are medium silica sand which presents the behavior of the sand bed of east china sea and south china sea regions where monopile foundations are widely used the relative density of the sand in this study is 27 with unit weight of 19 kg m3 and frictional angle and dilatancy angle are 30 5 and 1 respectively the maximum and minimum void ratios are 0 92 and 0 6 respectively the grading curve of the sand is show in fig 4 which demonstrates the particle size is relatively uniform with the median grain size d 50 to be 0 52 mm in accordance to the scaling laws if the grain size of sand used in the model tests is too coarse it will represent a larger grain size of the in site prototype at which the behavior of the individual sand grains will dominate the pile soil interaction rather than the soil mass klinkvort 2012 reported the minimum ratio of pile diameter to median grain size d d 50 is between 50 and 88 garnier et al 2007 suggested that a ratio of d d 50 greater than 60 is acceptable to eliminate the grain size effect on the lateral response of piles in this study the ratio of d d 50 is approximately 115 and the grain size effect is therefore negligible before the tests dry sand is poured into the container submerged by water then the sand is filled to form a cushion with a thickness of 250 mm or 340 mm next the pile is vertically buried in the specific position of soil the direction of strain gauge is consistent with the flow and lateral loading direction the embedded length l of the pile is 450 mm or 360 mm the filled soil is compacted using a square plate edge of 20 cm and weight of 4 5 kg a falling distance of 50 mm or 40 mm a thickness of each layer of 150 10 mm or 120 10 mm and 40 times for each layer the sand is filled to a full depth of 700 2 mm the sand bed has a dry density ranging from 1528 kg m3 to 1543 kg m3 corresponding to a relative density range 25 2 with a friction angle of 30 5 2 4 test plan table 3 tabulates the test plan a series of tests are performed to investigate the coupling effects of water flow soil depth and loading condition on the deformation and internal force of the pile detailed test results are shown in section 3 to 6 3 the influence of water flow on pile and soil without loads in this section the influence of water flow on the sand stratum and pile internal stress are examined based on the test results when the pile is subjected to the action of water flow alone without lateral load the lateral displacement of the model pile at a height of 360 mm above the surface of the sand bed is found to be less than 0 1 mm 0 002d as shown in fig 5 a the maximum bending moment of the pile shaft is less than 1 n m fig 5 b this indicates that the lateral response of piles is minor when under the action of water flow alone upon water flow a scour hole is formed in the soil around the pile and the maximum scouring depth is gradually increased over time the development of scouring depth is monitored through the marking lines on the external surface of the pile shaft it can be seen from fig 6 that in the initial 20 min the scouring depth increases rapidly then the scouring depth begins to increase slowly and after 90 min a maximum scouring depth is achieved which provides a reference of scouring condition for the later loading tests it is worth noting that the scouring depth around the pile is also found to influence the thickness of soil around the piles which leads to a change of the physical and mechanical properties of the soil according to lin et al 2010 the relatively density of the sand δd r around the pile is changed by scouring especially the nature of the shallow soil such change will directly affect the bearing capacity of pile 4 the influence of water flow to the vertical deformation and load bearing capacity to investigate the influence of water flow to the pile vertical deformation and load bearing capacity fig 7 shows the vertical load displacement curves of piles with and without water flow the measured vertical displacement of the pile is normalized against the pile diameter it can be found that the presence of water flow reduces the initial stiffness k vi of the vertical load displacement curves which also results in an increase in the vertical settlement of the pile under the same vertical load for the pile with an embedded depth of 450 mm the vertical load displacement curves of the piles with and without water flow gradually converge after the vertical settlement reaches 0 02d the ultimate vertical load bearing capacities v ult are found to be 208 n and 211 n with and without water flow respectively indicating marginal difference for the pile with an embedded depth of 360 mm under the applied vertical load the displacement of the pile increase at different rates until the vertical settlement reaches 0 05d the ultimate vertical load bearing capacities v ult are 178 n and 186 n with and without water flow it can therefore be concluded that the effect of water flow on the vertical load bearing capacity of piles is minor when the piles are installed in relatively deep soil which nevertheless is remarkable when they are embedded in shallow soil condition the above phenomenon could be attributed to the following reasons the vertical load bearing capacity of the pile is mainly provided by the shaft friction resistance during the initial loading stage with the existence of water flow scouring hole is formed around the pile resulting in a decrease of the contact area between the pile and surrounding soil the total shaft friction resistance is therefore reduced which also causes a decrease in the initial stiffness in the vertical load displacement curve the smaller the embedded depth of the pile is the greater reduction to the initial stiffness is to be found however considering the friction between pile and surrounding soil is relatively small the model pile in the test is close ended in this study when the vertical displacement exceeds a critical value the shaft friction resistance will be fully exerted as a result the vertical load bearing capacity of the pile is mainly contributed by the tip resistance of the pile rather than the shaft friction resistance according to calculation the variation of relative density dr and other parameters of deep soil around the pile after water flow is minor and the similar findings are reported by lin et al 2010 in other words the properties of the bearing layer at the pile toe are hardly affected as a result the difference of the bearing deformation between two piles gradually reduces as the proportion of the contribution with the tip resistance increases therefore for the pile foundation with a large embedded depth the effect of water flow is minor but for the floating pile which mainly provides the vertical load bearing capacity by shaft friction resistance the effect of water flow could be considerable which must be considered in practical design the vertical load bearing capacity of such pile should be correspondingly reduces fig 7 b shows the distributions of the axial force applied to the pile that is derived using the measured strain it can be observed that when the vertical load is less than 196 n the change rate of the axial force in the pile shaft along the pile depth without water flow effect is greater than that with the existence of water flow it indicates that the sand provides more shaft friction resistance when no water flow is considered the axial force in the pile shaft in the lower half of the pile in the flowing water is larger than that when there is no water which indicates that in the initial vertical loading stage of the pile foundation in flowing water the shaft friction resistance is small that leads to load transfer to the deep soil layer and the pile end bearing capacity begins to play a greater role it reflects the effect of the aforementioned initial load displacement curve of the pile with consideration of flowing water is relatively small with the increase of vertical load the axial force of the pile shaft changes with the depth with and without flowing water is very close indicating that the bearing deformation characteristics of the pile foundation gradually converge at this instance and the effect of the water flow on vertical load bearing capacity of the pile foundation is reduced 5 the influence of water flow to the lateral deformation and load bearing capacity of the pile 5 1 failure modes under coupled condition significant difference can be observed through the failure modes of the pile subjected to lateral loading with and without the existence of water flow it can be seen from fig 8 a that when the pile is solely under the action of the lateral load without water flow the sand surface in front the pile horses up slightly while the sand surface behind the of the pile horses down no separation between the pile and soil interface can be observed in comparison with the existence of water flow under the combined action of lateral load and water the sand particles gradually transport fig 8 b shows the failure mode of the surrounding soil under the combined actions of lateral load and water flow a scouring hole is developed in the surrounding soil under the action of water flow a sand dune is also formed at the downstream and the depth of the scouring hole of the upstream is obviously deeper than that of the downstream such failure mode is formed mainly because of the combined action of water flow induced scouring and lateral load applied to the pile 5 2 pile lateral displacement fig 9 shows the lateral load time histories and the pile displacement time histories it can be observed that when the lateral load is relatively small the lateral displacement of pile stabilizes and converges quickly but the time required for pile displacement stabilization becomes longer as the lateral load magnitude increases and with the existence of water flow it takes even longer for the soil to stabilize the level of vertical load on the pile also appears to influence the stable rate of the pile as can be found with a pre applied vertical load of 66 n 1 3v ult on the pile head the pile rapidly stabilizes after about 60mins without water flow but with a larger vertical load i e v 137 n slightly longer time about 80mins is needed for the pile to stabilize this is because the model pile in the test is relatively light in weight and therefore the influence of buoyancy and water flow disturbance could be significant the applied vertical load can cancel off the buoyancy and reduce the effect of water vortex around the pile more importantly the vertical load could increase the major principal stress and therefore the shear strength of the soil hazzar et al 2017 as a result the load bearing capacity and stability of the pile could be improved however when the vertical load is large enough the function of pile shaft friction resistance is gradually decrease and the additional bending moment generated by the vertical load is more significant which leads to adverse effect in improving the stability of the lateral load bearing capacity of the pile in order to evaluate the time effects of lateral loading on the pile shaft under different vertical loads and water flow conditions the normalized lateral displacement ratio ξ d is defined 2 ξ d δ y i t δ y i t where δy i t and δy i t are the normalized displacement per unit load for the cases with and without water flow subjected at time t in the ith load step which equals the incremental displacement the differential displacement between two adjacent load stages divided by the incremental load the differential load between two adjacent load stages to examine the effect of water flow on the behavior of pile subjected to lateral load the results of pile response under different load stages are shown in fig 10 with various vertical load it can be seen from fig 10 a c and e that the lateral displacement ratio of the pile under flowing state to the static state gradually increases from less than 1 with the development of loading time to eventually more than 1 at zero vertical load condition i e v 0 it indicates that the lateral displacement increment of the pile under flowing state at the same load is lower than that under the static state but then gradually exceeds that under the static state this is probably because under the combined loading conditions the displacement response of the pile is delayed without water flow the damage state of the soil around the pile does not correspond to the lateral load applied but since scour around the pile by water flow is not significant its influence on the load bearing capacity of the pile shaft is relatively small as a result the displacement ratio gradually increases to 1 while the portion exceeding 1 represents the additional displacement caused by water flow induced sediment transportation meanwhile to some extend the displacement ratio increases as the lateral load level increases which means the larger the load the greater the effect of water flow on the lateral displacement of the pile is the initial value of the displacement ratio decreases when a vertical load is applied according to the growing trend of the curves it can be estimated that the final value is only slightly over 1 0 after 20 min in addition comparing fig 10 a and fig 10 c and e it can be found that the vertical load could balance the influence of water flow on the lateral displacement of the pile but the extend of this effect is still minor as shown in fig 10 b d and f the lateral displacement ratio is not clearly corresponded to time after flowing state to the static state meanwhile no obvious correlation can be found for the magnitude of lateral load this is probably because lateral load is only applied to the pile in the wake of water flow acting on the pile only scouring effect from water is considered which nevertheless is minor only equals to the common scour depths 0 7d mentioned by sumer and fredsøe 2002 the effect of scour depth on the lateral load bearing behavior of the pile when installed in shallow soil condition is limited meanwhile the water is in static state when the pile is laterally loaded consequently the displacement ratio in the static water state does not show a significant correlation with time in addition it can be seen that in the state after water flow and a vertical load of 137 n applied the lateral displacement ratio is significantly less than 1 0 this is likely because all the levels of lateral loads applied in this group of tests are relatively small not reaching the corresponding loading level of the pile in the static state of water based on the above discussion it can be drawn that the water flow has significant effect on the behavior of pile resistant to lateral load 5 3 pile bending moment under coupled condition the bending moment along the pile shaft can be calculated using the strain data collected from the tests fig 11 shows the profiles of the bending moment along the pile which turn out to be all positive in value the position of the maximum bending moment on the pile shaft is near 2 3d below the mudline which appears to be less affected by the vertical load and water flow with the increase of lateral load the position of the maximum bending moment on the pile moves down slightly because of test restriction the lateral load applied in each test is not completely consistent therefore the comparative analysis of the bending moment on the pile shaft under different water flow conditions and vertical loading conditions needs to be normalized the bending moment ratio ξ m is defined herein that can be derived as follow 3 ξ m m i m i where m i and m i are the normalized moment of pile at the ith step load of the cases with and without water flow respectively which are normalized through divided by the corresponding horizontal load to examine the effect of state of water on the behavior of the bending moment of pile fig 12 shows the results of the bending moment ratio under various flowing states to explore the effect of water flow on the bending moments of the pile subjected horizontal load under different stage of water flow it can be found that under load level 1 lower load the dispersion is relatively large since this load level is relatively low it is regarded as abnormal and is therefore not used in the subsequent analysis fig 12 a c and e show the bending moment ratio of the flowing state static state is basically greater than 1 0 which indicates that when the water flow and the lateral concentrated force act on the pile shaft simultaneously the bending moment increases significantly comparing to the lateral concentrate load applied independently since the hydrodynamic force generates an additional bending moment on the pile shaft scouring results in a reduction in the embedment depth of the pile shaft and the loss of soil resistance around the pile the superposition of the two effects leads to an increase in the bending moment of the pile shaft from fig 12 b d f it can be seen that the ratio of the bending moments of the pile shaft in the static after flowing state and flowing state are similar in the static water flow state after the disturbance of water flow on the pile shaft no longer exists but only the scouring effect of water flow on the soil around the pile is retained and the increase of the bending moment of the pile shaft is mainly caused by scouring effect of water flow comparing the first two and the last four figures in fig 12 the vertical load slightly alleviates the effect of water flow on the bending moment of the pile at sections above the mud line it can also be found that the effect of water flow on the bending moment gradually decreases with the increase of lateral load level as the lateral load increases the bending moment ratio ξ m gradually decreases which means that the bending moment of the pile shaft in the flowing state or static after flowing state of water gradually converges with that in the static water state it indicates that the internal force of the pile is controlled gradually by the magnitude of a large lateral load and the effects of the state of water on the bending moment of the pile shaft gradually weakens with the increases of lateral load fig 13 shows the bending moment ratio affected by vertical load levels when the lateral load is small the vertical load of 66 n 1 3v ult at the pile head leads to the bending moment ratio of the pile shaft less than 1 0 when the lateral load is large the vertical load at the pile head results in the bending moment ratio of the pile shaft greater than 1 in other words the lager the lateral load is the larger the bending moment ratio of the pile shaft becomes this is because when the lateral load is small the eccentricity of the vertical load is small since vertical load is beneficial to the development of bending moment in the pile shaft caused by the lateral load when the lateral load is large it increases the degree of deflection in the pile shaft leading to moment amplification effect due to p delta effect 5 4 pile response with water flow effect the lateral deflection y z of the pile shaft can be obtained by double integration of the bending moment using eq 4 the two integration constants are determined using the measured displacement at the lateral loading point as well as the assumption that the lateral displacement at the point of zero soil resistance to be zero qi et al 2016 4 y z 1 e i m z d z 2 the function of bending moment distribution is fitted by the fifth order polynomial function m z 5 m z a 1 z 5 a 2 z 4 a 3 z 3 a 4 z 2 a 5 z a 6 where a 1 a 6 are the fitting coefficients the displacement of piles affected by flowing state is plotted in fig 14 it can be found that during the flow state the lateral displacement is clearly larger than that under static state the lateral displacements of the pile before and after water flow are very close under similar lateral loads fig 15 illustrates the lateral displacement under vertical lateral coupled loading condition it can be observed that with the increase of vertical load the difference between the pile displacement under static state and that under flowing state become smaller however this difference still exists which indicates the influence of water flow should not be ignored 6 prediction of pile lateral load bearing capacity with water flow 6 1 dimensionless load bearing capacity envelope previous studies employed the ultimate lateral load that piles could withstand at a lateral displacement of 0 1d at the mud line as the ultimate lateral load bearing capacity cuéllar et al 2012 when the lateral displacement of a pile at the mud line is 0 1d the corresponding displacement at the loading point of the pile is found to be about 0 3d this study inherits this method that the lateral load applied to the pile with a corresponding displacement of 0 3d is taken as the ultimate lateral load bearing capacity for piles the dimensionless load bearing capacity envelope of piles is obtained and shown in fig 16 it demonstrates that the load bearing capacity envelope in the flow state is significantly lower than that under the static state it is more apparent that when the vertical load is zero water flow leads to a significant decrease to the lateral load bearing capacity of the pile when the vertical load increases the influence of water flow on the lateral load bearing capacity of the pile shaft becomes weaker this phenomenon indicates that the pile foundation is more vulnerable before the superstructure is constructed however marginal difference can be observed on the load bearing capacity envelope for piles under static after water flowing state as compared to that the static state it indicates that the combined actions of water flow and lateral load could impose unnoticeable risks which could strongly affect the load bearing capacity of pile foundations particularly for offshore applications if the integrity of a pile foundation is not substantially deteriorated after the action of water the pile foundation could continue to maintain relatively good load bearing performance the envelopes in fig 16 are fitted using eq 6 which are based on the commonly used formulae for inclined pull out loaded suction caissons introduced by supachawarote et al 2004 6 α v v ult a β h h ult b 1 where a and b are the fitting coefficients α and β are the effect factors of water flow on the vertical and lateral responses of the pile the fitted load bearing capacity envelope is expressed as eq 7 which can address the impact of water flow on the vertical and lateral responses of piles as follows 7 v v ult 7 h h ult 1 404 1 static a 1 019 v v ult 11 1 08 h h ult 1 166 1 flowing b 1 019 v v ult 10 5 1 003 h h ult 1 125 1 static after flow c when eq 7 is employed in engineering practice the independent vertical and lateral load bearing capacities of the pile in the static water state should be determined first and then the combined load of the in site condition is substituted into eq 7a if the calculated value on the left side of eq 7a is less than 1 0 the load is continued to be substituted into eq 7b for evaluation of the composite load bearing capacity in the water flowing state 6 2 measured p y curves under coupled condition api and dnv standards are commonly used in offshore design practices for pile foundations in these standards the p y curves which are based on the winkler model is recommended to analyze and design monopiles subjected to lateral loads the nonlinear p y curve was firstly introduced by reese and matlock 1956 and mcclelland and focht 1958 then the more classical p y curves by reese et al 1974 o neill and murchison 1983 for sand and matlock 1970 for clay were proposed however this analysis method was proven to be problematic for large diameter monopiles therefore this paper attempts to derive a p y curve for piles based on the measured data from the laboratory model tests the soil resistance p z can be obtained by double differentiation of the bending moment using eq 8 8 p z d 2 m z d z 2 the p y curves in the specific depth are obtained by combining the discrete values of the soil resistance and lateral deflection as shown in fig 17 when the soil depth z is less than 4d the stiffness of the p y curves increase rapidly as the depth increases but when the depth exceeds 4d the difference of the stiffness between the p y curves becomes minor by comparing with the api method api 2014 it can be observed that the initial stiffness of the experimental derived p y curves is lower than those in api code which is consist with the test results of choo and kim 2016 it can also be seen that the soil resistance of the test derived p y curve exceeds or about to exceed the limiting soil resistance p u of the api code in the depth of 1 2d according to the development trend of the curves api code underestimates p u of shallow soils around piles due to the limitation of the loading and measurement system in this test the deflection of the pile shaft is not large enough the deeper p y curves are therefore not developed to a level close to the limit soil resistance therefore the limiting soil resistance p u of the experiment derived p y curve and that from api code cannot be directly compared under different vertical loads and water flow states the p y curves in multiple depth are shown in fig 17 it can be found that the soil resistance and the stiffness of the p y curves increase considerably with depth and the initial stiffness of the curves is generally close under different water flow and vertical load conditions the soil resistance at a relatively large lateral displacements is reduced only when the top vertical load is zero in the flowing state of water this may be due to the low self weight of the model pile which makes it more susceptible to water turbulence and buoyancy when there is no vertical load on the pile head in general except for the condition of zero vertical load on the pile head under water flow the effects of vertical load and water state on the p y curves of a pile is limited when the superstructure is not constructed special attention should be paid to the influence of water flow on the pile foundation 7 conclusions an experimental study on the lateral response and load bearing capacity of monopile with consideration of water flow is carried out in this study the following findings are concluded 1 water flow can result in a maximum scouring depth of 0 7 d pile diameter which reduces the lateral bearing capacity by about 4 10 2 dimensionless vertical lateral combined load bearing capacity envelope is proposed to estimate the performance of monopole in sand with water flow 3 based on 1 g model test data p y curves of a pile considering the water flow

20975,this paper presents the results of a series of laboratory studies to explore the effects of water flow on the bearing capacity of monopiles in sand the load displacement relationship axial force normalized bending moment of the pile shaft the p y curves and the bearing envelope are obtained to quantify the effect of water flow on the bearing capacity of the monopile the results demonstrate that water flow can result in a maximum scouring depth of 0 7 d pile diameter which reduces the lateral bearing capacity by about 4 10 it is also found that the bearing capacity of the pile for resisting eccentric lateral load equals to moment and horizontal loads at mudline slightly increases at the initial stage with the rise of the applied vertical load finally the bearing capacity envelopes of pile with and without water flow are proposed which can provide guidance for the design of monopiles keywords large diameter monopile water flow vertical load bearing capacity model tests 1 introduction 1 1 conception large diameter monopiles are one of the most commonly used foundations for offshore wind turbines owt due to its relatively low installation costs and enough load bearing capacity in shallow sea areas with water depth less than 30 m leblanc et al 2010 achmus et al 2009 doherty and gavin 2012 to improve energy production owt projects are moving from near coast within 30 m depth to deeper waters and larger superstructure of wind turbine 10 mw and above electricity output is being designed and constructed larger size monopiles are therefore used to support the taller wind turbine towers and larger dimensions of the rotor blades and nacelle monopile foundations would be exposed to a greater magnitude of lateral loads caused by wind ocean waves and currents etc and a larger vertical load from superstructure simultaneously for such a large size monopile the interaction between monopile and fluids becomes significant where the lateral movement of water can apply drag force to the monopile resulting in structural vibration as well as causing scouring to the surrounding soil near the monopile which affect the load bearing capacity of the monopile foundation see in fig 1 therefore it is necessary to properly understand the behavior of monopile foundation system for wind turbine using in deep water environment that is subjected to complex loading conditions 1 2 previous work previous studies employed experimental and numerical methods to investigate the behavior of piles under combined vertical v and eccentric lateral loads h m i e horizontal and moment loadings in sand clay or in site soil conditions table 1 summarizes existing studies under combined vertical and eccentric lateral loading conditions v h m loadings there is still no agreement on whether the vertical load would increase or weaken the eccentric lateral load bearing capacity of pile shafts nevertheless it is commonly believed that the effect of vertical load on the lateral load bearing capacity of the pile is related to soil types i e when the pile is in sand a higher vertical load level is found to increase the lateral load bearing capacity but when the pile is in clay vertical load is found to have adverse effect to the lateral load bearing capacity of the pile karthigeyan et al 2007 babu et al 2016 hazzar et al 2017 for offshore foundation application with large diameter steel pipe piles haiderali et al 2013 found that the level of vertical load applied to the pile has only minor weakening effect on the ultimate lateral load bearing capacity however all those researches were mainly based on analysis of pile soil stress state the influence of fluid and the interaction between water and pile is rarely considered despite the absolute value of water pressure act on the pile shaft is relatively small scouring effect around piles could be developed when the current velocity near the mud surface exceeds the threshold of sediment transportation which results in a decrease of the embedded depth of pile and a reduction of the bearing capacity of pile kishore et al 2009 meanwhile since the scour depth is related to the diameter of pile scouring effect has a great impact on piles with large diameter and small length diameter ratio in consideration to this phenomenon the mechanism of scouring around large diameter piles and prediction of maximum scouring depth have attracted much attention at the moment the commonly accepted methods for predicting local scouring depth include breusers et al 1977 sumer and fredsøe 2002 and the method in hydraulic engineering circular no 18 hec 18 of the federal highway administration of the united states richardson and davis 2001 etc but understanding on the impact of scouring effect to the lateral load bearing capacity of monopile is still limited some researchers carried out theoretical analysis and employed laboratory test using dig out soils around piles to correct the p y curve of the laterally loaded pile after scouring lin et al 2010 2016 numerical studies were also conducted to study the effects of depth width and slope angle of the scour hole on the lateral load bearing capacity of piles li et al 2013 lin et al 2014 2016 some laboratory tests were used to study the influence of scouring on the lateral load bearing capacity of monopiles reese et al 1989 kishore et al 2009 qi et al 2016 it was also found that apart from scouring flow field around the pile could be seriously disturbed due to the pile and fluid interaction the downward flow and the horseshoe vortex were found to form in front of the pile and the streamlines on both sides of the pile shaft shrink along the direction of water flow meanwhile as the water flow generates vortex behind the pile resulting in a turbulence flow field around the pile in such a turbulence flow field the change of the instantaneous water pressure acting on the pile shaft becomes very complicated in both time and space domains the vortex induced vibration is therefore developed and the stability of the pile is affected to date limited study is available on the influence of water flow to the lateral response of a pile most of existing studies were conducted in an environment without consideration of water flow in order to fully understand the influence of water flow on the load bearing capacity of a pile and establish an accurate prediction model of the load bearing capacity of large diameter monopiles it is necessary to thoroughly understanding the mechanism and behavior of monopiles in water condition through properly designed experimental research in this study a series of 1 g model tests are conducted on large diameter monopile foundation in sand subjected with v h combing loading the model is installed in underwater condition the influence of water flow with scouring effect on the load bearing capacity of monopiles are quantified which provide a guidance for the design of offshore monopile foundations 2 theory and methodology 2 1 scaling laws for model test laboratory model test can be scalable to predict the in site load bearing behavior of a full scale monopile prototype detailed scaling laws for model tests of offshore monopile foundations were reported by leblanc et al 2010 bhattacharya et al 2011 and cuéllar et al 2012 since the behavior of owt is a very complex problem that involves pile soil interaction aerodynamics between wind turbine and air and fluid dynamics around the monopile between pile shaft and water fluid dozens of parameters are involved in the scaling laws in the current study the laboratory model is referring to an offshore monopile prototype with a diameter of 6 m a wall thickness of 0 06 m and an embedded depth of 45 m or 36 m a model reducing scale λ of 1 100 is employed detailed scaling laws between the model pile and prototypes are listed in table 2 it is worth noting that certain parameters such as the wall thickness and flexural stiffness of piles do not strictly follow the ratio of 1 100 because of modeling limitation and material availability nevertheless these parameters are considered to be none critical parameters which would therefore not significantly affect test results it is believed that the model tests could reasonably capture the primary characteristics of the in situ conditions of the monopile under water environment 2 2 test device fig 2 illustrates the test system to simulate a monopile foundation subjected to combined vertical lateral loads as well as under the action of water flow in the marine environment an experimental flume 5 8 m in length 0 48 m in width and 0 5 m in depth made of toughened glass and steel frame is used in this study it includes a sunken soil trough laying in the middle of the flume 1 4 m in length 0 48 m in width 0 7 m in depth to deposit the sand the top of the soil is levelled with the bottom of the flume the flume also comprises of 1 a pile loading and deformation monitoring system and 2 a water flow simulation and monitoring system 2 2 1 pile loading and deformation monitoring system a hollow circular tube made of pmma plexiglass is used as the model pile in this test fig 2 c it has a total length of 1000 mm including an embedded section a submerged section of the pile shaft and a transition section of the pile to tower an external diameter d of 60 mm a wall thickness t of 2 mm and an elastic modulus e p of 3 02 gpa the external surface of the pile is sanded along 45 circumferential direction using sandpaper 60 to increase the roughness of the pile which best complies to the in situ engineering practice the bottom of the model pile is sealed with a solid conical block 8 mm long pvc shell filled with c30 concrete a total of 9 pairs of strain gauges are installed to the external surface of the pile the red square in fig 2 c the wires of the strain gauges are installed through the pre punched holes 3 mm in diameter inside the pile epoxy resin is used to protection the strain gauges and also to provide waterproofing the strains due to pile bending are measured in each group of the tests two piles are installed as shown in fig 2 b to prevent interference of piles and to eliminate the influence of boundary conditions the piles are positioned as far away as possible between each other and from the flume wall the distance between the two piles and that between the pile and the boundary wall exceed 7 times the diameters in the longitudinal direction and 3 time the diameters in the transverse nogami and novak 1977 davisson 1970 to properly consider the pile fluid interaction and minimize the influence of boundary condition 3 times the diameters is a proper distance between piles to the side wall of the flume li et al 2015 following leblanc et al 2010 when applying vertical load a cushion layer below the pile tip is maintained that exceeds 4 times the diameters of piles so as to eliminate the influence of bottom boundary the lateral load acting on the pile shaft is applied through a pneumatic cylinder which is installed on a triangle reaction frame on the side wall of the flume the loading point is at an elevation of 360 mm above the mudline a load cell is attached to the cylinder rod to measure the applied lateral force a pivot is installed at end of the loading rod allowing rotation of the pile which ensures the loading direction remains horizontal after the pile shaft is inclined to avoid any vibration interference from water flow to the displacement measurement a shelf for displacement sensor is installed that is independent of the flume system two laterally mounted laser sensors are attached to the shelf to measure the lateral deformation of the pile i e one at the same height of the loading point and the other at 100 mm below the loading point in addition a vertically placed pneumatic cylinder is installed to apply the vertical load on the pile head the vertical settlement of the pile is measured by a third laser sensor which is installed paralleled with the pile axis the vertical and lateral responses of the model pile are measured by the slow maintenance loading method in which the displacement time histories are recorded every 5 min and the change of displacement less or equal to 0 01 mm 5 min are taken as the stability criterion for each loading level the ultimate vertical load bearing capacity v ult of the pile is taken as the load corresponding to a settlement of 0 03d davisson 1972 ng et al 2004 for combined loading the swipe method proposed by tan 1990 is used where a vertical load is applied to the pile head by stacking weights first and then the currents and lateral load are applied 2 2 2 simulation of water flow a pump system is used to generate the circulating one way water flow in the flume a square hole grille block length 0 3 m width 0 5 m and depth 0 4 m see in fig 2 is placed at 1 m away from the inlet side of the flume to straighten the direction of water flow as far as possible to minimize the turbulence the grille block is assembled from a plurality of square tubes with a side of 0 05 m and length of 0 3 m horizontal and parallel to the direction of water flow the velocities of the water flow u c are measured by an acoustic doppler velocimeter adv which is installed at 10d in front of the model pile and the distribution of u c along water depth can be obtained by adjusting the height of the detector to study the effect of water flow and vertical load on the lateral response of piles a series of tests are carried out at a constant water depth of 200 mm the velocity of water flow at the upstream 10d of the pile in the flume is designed according to the scaling laws and collected by the detector as shown in fig 3 the velocity distribution is found to be approximately trapezoidal along the water depth the drag force acting on the pile is estimated first during the flow of water lateral drag load is generated on the submerged section of the pile shaft the lateral drag load can be calculating by eq 1 as 1 f 1 2 c d ρ w a p 0 h u c 2 d h where c d 1 2 is the drag coefficient of the water flow ρ w 1000 kg m3 is the density of water a p is the projected area of unit pile length perpendicular to the direction of water flow and h is the water depth the drag load of the applied water flow on the pile shaft is approximately 0 8 n following eq 1 2 3 soil preparation and mechanical parameters the sand for embedding model piles are medium silica sand which presents the behavior of the sand bed of east china sea and south china sea regions where monopile foundations are widely used the relative density of the sand in this study is 27 with unit weight of 19 kg m3 and frictional angle and dilatancy angle are 30 5 and 1 respectively the maximum and minimum void ratios are 0 92 and 0 6 respectively the grading curve of the sand is show in fig 4 which demonstrates the particle size is relatively uniform with the median grain size d 50 to be 0 52 mm in accordance to the scaling laws if the grain size of sand used in the model tests is too coarse it will represent a larger grain size of the in site prototype at which the behavior of the individual sand grains will dominate the pile soil interaction rather than the soil mass klinkvort 2012 reported the minimum ratio of pile diameter to median grain size d d 50 is between 50 and 88 garnier et al 2007 suggested that a ratio of d d 50 greater than 60 is acceptable to eliminate the grain size effect on the lateral response of piles in this study the ratio of d d 50 is approximately 115 and the grain size effect is therefore negligible before the tests dry sand is poured into the container submerged by water then the sand is filled to form a cushion with a thickness of 250 mm or 340 mm next the pile is vertically buried in the specific position of soil the direction of strain gauge is consistent with the flow and lateral loading direction the embedded length l of the pile is 450 mm or 360 mm the filled soil is compacted using a square plate edge of 20 cm and weight of 4 5 kg a falling distance of 50 mm or 40 mm a thickness of each layer of 150 10 mm or 120 10 mm and 40 times for each layer the sand is filled to a full depth of 700 2 mm the sand bed has a dry density ranging from 1528 kg m3 to 1543 kg m3 corresponding to a relative density range 25 2 with a friction angle of 30 5 2 4 test plan table 3 tabulates the test plan a series of tests are performed to investigate the coupling effects of water flow soil depth and loading condition on the deformation and internal force of the pile detailed test results are shown in section 3 to 6 3 the influence of water flow on pile and soil without loads in this section the influence of water flow on the sand stratum and pile internal stress are examined based on the test results when the pile is subjected to the action of water flow alone without lateral load the lateral displacement of the model pile at a height of 360 mm above the surface of the sand bed is found to be less than 0 1 mm 0 002d as shown in fig 5 a the maximum bending moment of the pile shaft is less than 1 n m fig 5 b this indicates that the lateral response of piles is minor when under the action of water flow alone upon water flow a scour hole is formed in the soil around the pile and the maximum scouring depth is gradually increased over time the development of scouring depth is monitored through the marking lines on the external surface of the pile shaft it can be seen from fig 6 that in the initial 20 min the scouring depth increases rapidly then the scouring depth begins to increase slowly and after 90 min a maximum scouring depth is achieved which provides a reference of scouring condition for the later loading tests it is worth noting that the scouring depth around the pile is also found to influence the thickness of soil around the piles which leads to a change of the physical and mechanical properties of the soil according to lin et al 2010 the relatively density of the sand δd r around the pile is changed by scouring especially the nature of the shallow soil such change will directly affect the bearing capacity of pile 4 the influence of water flow to the vertical deformation and load bearing capacity to investigate the influence of water flow to the pile vertical deformation and load bearing capacity fig 7 shows the vertical load displacement curves of piles with and without water flow the measured vertical displacement of the pile is normalized against the pile diameter it can be found that the presence of water flow reduces the initial stiffness k vi of the vertical load displacement curves which also results in an increase in the vertical settlement of the pile under the same vertical load for the pile with an embedded depth of 450 mm the vertical load displacement curves of the piles with and without water flow gradually converge after the vertical settlement reaches 0 02d the ultimate vertical load bearing capacities v ult are found to be 208 n and 211 n with and without water flow respectively indicating marginal difference for the pile with an embedded depth of 360 mm under the applied vertical load the displacement of the pile increase at different rates until the vertical settlement reaches 0 05d the ultimate vertical load bearing capacities v ult are 178 n and 186 n with and without water flow it can therefore be concluded that the effect of water flow on the vertical load bearing capacity of piles is minor when the piles are installed in relatively deep soil which nevertheless is remarkable when they are embedded in shallow soil condition the above phenomenon could be attributed to the following reasons the vertical load bearing capacity of the pile is mainly provided by the shaft friction resistance during the initial loading stage with the existence of water flow scouring hole is formed around the pile resulting in a decrease of the contact area between the pile and surrounding soil the total shaft friction resistance is therefore reduced which also causes a decrease in the initial stiffness in the vertical load displacement curve the smaller the embedded depth of the pile is the greater reduction to the initial stiffness is to be found however considering the friction between pile and surrounding soil is relatively small the model pile in the test is close ended in this study when the vertical displacement exceeds a critical value the shaft friction resistance will be fully exerted as a result the vertical load bearing capacity of the pile is mainly contributed by the tip resistance of the pile rather than the shaft friction resistance according to calculation the variation of relative density dr and other parameters of deep soil around the pile after water flow is minor and the similar findings are reported by lin et al 2010 in other words the properties of the bearing layer at the pile toe are hardly affected as a result the difference of the bearing deformation between two piles gradually reduces as the proportion of the contribution with the tip resistance increases therefore for the pile foundation with a large embedded depth the effect of water flow is minor but for the floating pile which mainly provides the vertical load bearing capacity by shaft friction resistance the effect of water flow could be considerable which must be considered in practical design the vertical load bearing capacity of such pile should be correspondingly reduces fig 7 b shows the distributions of the axial force applied to the pile that is derived using the measured strain it can be observed that when the vertical load is less than 196 n the change rate of the axial force in the pile shaft along the pile depth without water flow effect is greater than that with the existence of water flow it indicates that the sand provides more shaft friction resistance when no water flow is considered the axial force in the pile shaft in the lower half of the pile in the flowing water is larger than that when there is no water which indicates that in the initial vertical loading stage of the pile foundation in flowing water the shaft friction resistance is small that leads to load transfer to the deep soil layer and the pile end bearing capacity begins to play a greater role it reflects the effect of the aforementioned initial load displacement curve of the pile with consideration of flowing water is relatively small with the increase of vertical load the axial force of the pile shaft changes with the depth with and without flowing water is very close indicating that the bearing deformation characteristics of the pile foundation gradually converge at this instance and the effect of the water flow on vertical load bearing capacity of the pile foundation is reduced 5 the influence of water flow to the lateral deformation and load bearing capacity of the pile 5 1 failure modes under coupled condition significant difference can be observed through the failure modes of the pile subjected to lateral loading with and without the existence of water flow it can be seen from fig 8 a that when the pile is solely under the action of the lateral load without water flow the sand surface in front the pile horses up slightly while the sand surface behind the of the pile horses down no separation between the pile and soil interface can be observed in comparison with the existence of water flow under the combined action of lateral load and water the sand particles gradually transport fig 8 b shows the failure mode of the surrounding soil under the combined actions of lateral load and water flow a scouring hole is developed in the surrounding soil under the action of water flow a sand dune is also formed at the downstream and the depth of the scouring hole of the upstream is obviously deeper than that of the downstream such failure mode is formed mainly because of the combined action of water flow induced scouring and lateral load applied to the pile 5 2 pile lateral displacement fig 9 shows the lateral load time histories and the pile displacement time histories it can be observed that when the lateral load is relatively small the lateral displacement of pile stabilizes and converges quickly but the time required for pile displacement stabilization becomes longer as the lateral load magnitude increases and with the existence of water flow it takes even longer for the soil to stabilize the level of vertical load on the pile also appears to influence the stable rate of the pile as can be found with a pre applied vertical load of 66 n 1 3v ult on the pile head the pile rapidly stabilizes after about 60mins without water flow but with a larger vertical load i e v 137 n slightly longer time about 80mins is needed for the pile to stabilize this is because the model pile in the test is relatively light in weight and therefore the influence of buoyancy and water flow disturbance could be significant the applied vertical load can cancel off the buoyancy and reduce the effect of water vortex around the pile more importantly the vertical load could increase the major principal stress and therefore the shear strength of the soil hazzar et al 2017 as a result the load bearing capacity and stability of the pile could be improved however when the vertical load is large enough the function of pile shaft friction resistance is gradually decrease and the additional bending moment generated by the vertical load is more significant which leads to adverse effect in improving the stability of the lateral load bearing capacity of the pile in order to evaluate the time effects of lateral loading on the pile shaft under different vertical loads and water flow conditions the normalized lateral displacement ratio ξ d is defined 2 ξ d δ y i t δ y i t where δy i t and δy i t are the normalized displacement per unit load for the cases with and without water flow subjected at time t in the ith load step which equals the incremental displacement the differential displacement between two adjacent load stages divided by the incremental load the differential load between two adjacent load stages to examine the effect of water flow on the behavior of pile subjected to lateral load the results of pile response under different load stages are shown in fig 10 with various vertical load it can be seen from fig 10 a c and e that the lateral displacement ratio of the pile under flowing state to the static state gradually increases from less than 1 with the development of loading time to eventually more than 1 at zero vertical load condition i e v 0 it indicates that the lateral displacement increment of the pile under flowing state at the same load is lower than that under the static state but then gradually exceeds that under the static state this is probably because under the combined loading conditions the displacement response of the pile is delayed without water flow the damage state of the soil around the pile does not correspond to the lateral load applied but since scour around the pile by water flow is not significant its influence on the load bearing capacity of the pile shaft is relatively small as a result the displacement ratio gradually increases to 1 while the portion exceeding 1 represents the additional displacement caused by water flow induced sediment transportation meanwhile to some extend the displacement ratio increases as the lateral load level increases which means the larger the load the greater the effect of water flow on the lateral displacement of the pile is the initial value of the displacement ratio decreases when a vertical load is applied according to the growing trend of the curves it can be estimated that the final value is only slightly over 1 0 after 20 min in addition comparing fig 10 a and fig 10 c and e it can be found that the vertical load could balance the influence of water flow on the lateral displacement of the pile but the extend of this effect is still minor as shown in fig 10 b d and f the lateral displacement ratio is not clearly corresponded to time after flowing state to the static state meanwhile no obvious correlation can be found for the magnitude of lateral load this is probably because lateral load is only applied to the pile in the wake of water flow acting on the pile only scouring effect from water is considered which nevertheless is minor only equals to the common scour depths 0 7d mentioned by sumer and fredsøe 2002 the effect of scour depth on the lateral load bearing behavior of the pile when installed in shallow soil condition is limited meanwhile the water is in static state when the pile is laterally loaded consequently the displacement ratio in the static water state does not show a significant correlation with time in addition it can be seen that in the state after water flow and a vertical load of 137 n applied the lateral displacement ratio is significantly less than 1 0 this is likely because all the levels of lateral loads applied in this group of tests are relatively small not reaching the corresponding loading level of the pile in the static state of water based on the above discussion it can be drawn that the water flow has significant effect on the behavior of pile resistant to lateral load 5 3 pile bending moment under coupled condition the bending moment along the pile shaft can be calculated using the strain data collected from the tests fig 11 shows the profiles of the bending moment along the pile which turn out to be all positive in value the position of the maximum bending moment on the pile shaft is near 2 3d below the mudline which appears to be less affected by the vertical load and water flow with the increase of lateral load the position of the maximum bending moment on the pile moves down slightly because of test restriction the lateral load applied in each test is not completely consistent therefore the comparative analysis of the bending moment on the pile shaft under different water flow conditions and vertical loading conditions needs to be normalized the bending moment ratio ξ m is defined herein that can be derived as follow 3 ξ m m i m i where m i and m i are the normalized moment of pile at the ith step load of the cases with and without water flow respectively which are normalized through divided by the corresponding horizontal load to examine the effect of state of water on the behavior of the bending moment of pile fig 12 shows the results of the bending moment ratio under various flowing states to explore the effect of water flow on the bending moments of the pile subjected horizontal load under different stage of water flow it can be found that under load level 1 lower load the dispersion is relatively large since this load level is relatively low it is regarded as abnormal and is therefore not used in the subsequent analysis fig 12 a c and e show the bending moment ratio of the flowing state static state is basically greater than 1 0 which indicates that when the water flow and the lateral concentrated force act on the pile shaft simultaneously the bending moment increases significantly comparing to the lateral concentrate load applied independently since the hydrodynamic force generates an additional bending moment on the pile shaft scouring results in a reduction in the embedment depth of the pile shaft and the loss of soil resistance around the pile the superposition of the two effects leads to an increase in the bending moment of the pile shaft from fig 12 b d f it can be seen that the ratio of the bending moments of the pile shaft in the static after flowing state and flowing state are similar in the static water flow state after the disturbance of water flow on the pile shaft no longer exists but only the scouring effect of water flow on the soil around the pile is retained and the increase of the bending moment of the pile shaft is mainly caused by scouring effect of water flow comparing the first two and the last four figures in fig 12 the vertical load slightly alleviates the effect of water flow on the bending moment of the pile at sections above the mud line it can also be found that the effect of water flow on the bending moment gradually decreases with the increase of lateral load level as the lateral load increases the bending moment ratio ξ m gradually decreases which means that the bending moment of the pile shaft in the flowing state or static after flowing state of water gradually converges with that in the static water state it indicates that the internal force of the pile is controlled gradually by the magnitude of a large lateral load and the effects of the state of water on the bending moment of the pile shaft gradually weakens with the increases of lateral load fig 13 shows the bending moment ratio affected by vertical load levels when the lateral load is small the vertical load of 66 n 1 3v ult at the pile head leads to the bending moment ratio of the pile shaft less than 1 0 when the lateral load is large the vertical load at the pile head results in the bending moment ratio of the pile shaft greater than 1 in other words the lager the lateral load is the larger the bending moment ratio of the pile shaft becomes this is because when the lateral load is small the eccentricity of the vertical load is small since vertical load is beneficial to the development of bending moment in the pile shaft caused by the lateral load when the lateral load is large it increases the degree of deflection in the pile shaft leading to moment amplification effect due to p delta effect 5 4 pile response with water flow effect the lateral deflection y z of the pile shaft can be obtained by double integration of the bending moment using eq 4 the two integration constants are determined using the measured displacement at the lateral loading point as well as the assumption that the lateral displacement at the point of zero soil resistance to be zero qi et al 2016 4 y z 1 e i m z d z 2 the function of bending moment distribution is fitted by the fifth order polynomial function m z 5 m z a 1 z 5 a 2 z 4 a 3 z 3 a 4 z 2 a 5 z a 6 where a 1 a 6 are the fitting coefficients the displacement of piles affected by flowing state is plotted in fig 14 it can be found that during the flow state the lateral displacement is clearly larger than that under static state the lateral displacements of the pile before and after water flow are very close under similar lateral loads fig 15 illustrates the lateral displacement under vertical lateral coupled loading condition it can be observed that with the increase of vertical load the difference between the pile displacement under static state and that under flowing state become smaller however this difference still exists which indicates the influence of water flow should not be ignored 6 prediction of pile lateral load bearing capacity with water flow 6 1 dimensionless load bearing capacity envelope previous studies employed the ultimate lateral load that piles could withstand at a lateral displacement of 0 1d at the mud line as the ultimate lateral load bearing capacity cuéllar et al 2012 when the lateral displacement of a pile at the mud line is 0 1d the corresponding displacement at the loading point of the pile is found to be about 0 3d this study inherits this method that the lateral load applied to the pile with a corresponding displacement of 0 3d is taken as the ultimate lateral load bearing capacity for piles the dimensionless load bearing capacity envelope of piles is obtained and shown in fig 16 it demonstrates that the load bearing capacity envelope in the flow state is significantly lower than that under the static state it is more apparent that when the vertical load is zero water flow leads to a significant decrease to the lateral load bearing capacity of the pile when the vertical load increases the influence of water flow on the lateral load bearing capacity of the pile shaft becomes weaker this phenomenon indicates that the pile foundation is more vulnerable before the superstructure is constructed however marginal difference can be observed on the load bearing capacity envelope for piles under static after water flowing state as compared to that the static state it indicates that the combined actions of water flow and lateral load could impose unnoticeable risks which could strongly affect the load bearing capacity of pile foundations particularly for offshore applications if the integrity of a pile foundation is not substantially deteriorated after the action of water the pile foundation could continue to maintain relatively good load bearing performance the envelopes in fig 16 are fitted using eq 6 which are based on the commonly used formulae for inclined pull out loaded suction caissons introduced by supachawarote et al 2004 6 α v v ult a β h h ult b 1 where a and b are the fitting coefficients α and β are the effect factors of water flow on the vertical and lateral responses of the pile the fitted load bearing capacity envelope is expressed as eq 7 which can address the impact of water flow on the vertical and lateral responses of piles as follows 7 v v ult 7 h h ult 1 404 1 static a 1 019 v v ult 11 1 08 h h ult 1 166 1 flowing b 1 019 v v ult 10 5 1 003 h h ult 1 125 1 static after flow c when eq 7 is employed in engineering practice the independent vertical and lateral load bearing capacities of the pile in the static water state should be determined first and then the combined load of the in site condition is substituted into eq 7a if the calculated value on the left side of eq 7a is less than 1 0 the load is continued to be substituted into eq 7b for evaluation of the composite load bearing capacity in the water flowing state 6 2 measured p y curves under coupled condition api and dnv standards are commonly used in offshore design practices for pile foundations in these standards the p y curves which are based on the winkler model is recommended to analyze and design monopiles subjected to lateral loads the nonlinear p y curve was firstly introduced by reese and matlock 1956 and mcclelland and focht 1958 then the more classical p y curves by reese et al 1974 o neill and murchison 1983 for sand and matlock 1970 for clay were proposed however this analysis method was proven to be problematic for large diameter monopiles therefore this paper attempts to derive a p y curve for piles based on the measured data from the laboratory model tests the soil resistance p z can be obtained by double differentiation of the bending moment using eq 8 8 p z d 2 m z d z 2 the p y curves in the specific depth are obtained by combining the discrete values of the soil resistance and lateral deflection as shown in fig 17 when the soil depth z is less than 4d the stiffness of the p y curves increase rapidly as the depth increases but when the depth exceeds 4d the difference of the stiffness between the p y curves becomes minor by comparing with the api method api 2014 it can be observed that the initial stiffness of the experimental derived p y curves is lower than those in api code which is consist with the test results of choo and kim 2016 it can also be seen that the soil resistance of the test derived p y curve exceeds or about to exceed the limiting soil resistance p u of the api code in the depth of 1 2d according to the development trend of the curves api code underestimates p u of shallow soils around piles due to the limitation of the loading and measurement system in this test the deflection of the pile shaft is not large enough the deeper p y curves are therefore not developed to a level close to the limit soil resistance therefore the limiting soil resistance p u of the experiment derived p y curve and that from api code cannot be directly compared under different vertical loads and water flow states the p y curves in multiple depth are shown in fig 17 it can be found that the soil resistance and the stiffness of the p y curves increase considerably with depth and the initial stiffness of the curves is generally close under different water flow and vertical load conditions the soil resistance at a relatively large lateral displacements is reduced only when the top vertical load is zero in the flowing state of water this may be due to the low self weight of the model pile which makes it more susceptible to water turbulence and buoyancy when there is no vertical load on the pile head in general except for the condition of zero vertical load on the pile head under water flow the effects of vertical load and water state on the p y curves of a pile is limited when the superstructure is not constructed special attention should be paid to the influence of water flow on the pile foundation 7 conclusions an experimental study on the lateral response and load bearing capacity of monopile with consideration of water flow is carried out in this study the following findings are concluded 1 water flow can result in a maximum scouring depth of 0 7 d pile diameter which reduces the lateral bearing capacity by about 4 10 2 dimensionless vertical lateral combined load bearing capacity envelope is proposed to estimate the performance of monopole in sand with water flow 3 based on 1 g model test data p y curves of a pile considering the water flow effect are proposed and compared with api code to show the difference between them which provide for guidance to quantify the effect of water flow on the p y curve credit authorship contribution

fulfill the collision avoidance we first discuss the maneuverability encounter situation division then a collision avoidance ad hoc network is constructed for the negotiation communication between usvs moreover to cope with complex collision avoidance situations an usv negotiation protocol is designed simulations under generous complex scenarios are carried out to validate the effectiveness of our approach results verify that our approach is effective and reliable for resolving the problem of a swarm of usvs collision avoidance keywords unmanned surface vehicles negotiation protocol encounter situation division collision avoidance ad hoc network complex collision avoidance 1 introduction along with continuous development of emerging intelligent control and motion planning technologies zhao et al 2020 unmanned surface vehicle usv is featured by flexible maneuverability and excellent autonomy and then is capable of autonomous navigation due to its huge potential applications usv plays an ever increasing important role in both military and civil fields including maritime management search and rescue marine science survey reconnaissance and attack mission etc ma et al 2018 zhao et al 1109 during executing the above tasks at sea it is significant that the safety of usv should be guaranteed consequently automatic collision avoidance issues of the usv should be effectively stressed many techniques have been generated for the collision avoidance problem of a single usv shi et al 2019 ref zhao et al 2016 conducted an optimal collision avoidance method on the basis of vector obstacles for usv under the guidance of colregs rules and validated its effectiveness by numerical simulation under elementary scenarios from the perspective of unsymmetrical ship domain encounter situations of usv were analyzed in johansen et al 2016 which supplied an aid to the quantification of motion model and collision avoidance rules ref ma et al 2019 introduced a trajectory tracking control method for surface ship and provided a reference for the motion control of usv when it comes to collision avoidance problem of a swarm of usvs lots of factors including maneuverability of the usv motion state of the obstacle navigation rules at sea should be addressed with the increasing of the number of usvs it is imperative to center the problem of distributed control peng et al 2017 under the guidance of navigation rules a series of analyses on collision avoidance simulation for vessels was conducted in lušić and čorić 2015 referring to collision avoidance strategy for usv a decomposition coordination method was put forward for simulating optimal steering angle while 4 vessels were approaching together zou 2010 with the aid of fuzzy semantic knowledge method environmental information was converted for analysis to generate a collision avoidance strategy eventually ali et al 2015 ref naeem et al 2012 employed a pid system for usv motion control and presented a collision avoidance strategy while subordinated to colregs rules general ant colony optimization was adopted for planning collision avoidance paths for vessels at sea lazarowska 2015 whereas the computation time was long and reached paths were unstable classical a algorithm was utilized for collision avoidance in lee et al 2004 wherein motion characteristics of obstacles were oversimplified referring to the protocol for usv collision avoidance a protocol based collision avoidance method was proposed for usvs with the aid of multi objective optimization benjamin et al 2006 it can be observed that ref benjamin et al 2006 focused on the collision avoidance between usvs under the framework of colregs whereas in this paper in order to take into account the unspecified collision avoidance in the colregs we tend to design the suitable negotiation protocol for collision avoidance problem of a swarm of usvs furthermore it is significant that communication is critical for collision avoidance benjamin et al 2006 hsu et al 2009 ma et al 1109 ref qiu and duan 2020 proposed a control frame that renders the many objective optimization problem into a multi objective optimization problem then based on the frame to solve safety problems ref ji et al 2014 focused on reaching group consensus for linearly coupled multi agent networks by employing linear protocols a proposed concrete group communication protocol can guarantee safe and reliable communication between individuals in the same group li and zhang 2017 which is of great significance for the approach via negotiation protocol a distributed stochastic search algorithm was implemented for multi vessel encounter situations wherein intentions and negotiations between vessels were addressed properly kim et al 2017 ref kim et al 2017 offered a favor to the communication between negotiation vessels in the light of the fuzzy inference system ref bukhari et al 2013 designed a vessel collision risk assessment system to calculate the degree of collision risk among all vessels it achieved the collision risk in negotiation protocol ref shao et al 2019 designed a novel cooperative platform for coupled usv uav systems and demonstrated that the framework design method of the communication data was essential for the negotiation protocol an excellent approach composed of a parameterized method and conflict resolution was introduced for multiple mobile robots motion planning under a time varying environment ma et al 2012 ref ma et al 2014 elucidated an intelligent algorithm to resolve multiple mobile robots routing issue under double warehouse scene and provided a reference for the selection of collision avoidance behaviors it is significant that the above research offers an excellent reference for our focused collision avoidance problem of a swarm of usvs it can be seen that significant progresses have been achieved on single usv collision avoidance issue whereas the above concerned issue could not reflect the practical motion environment roundly and little attention has been paid to the collision avoidance issue for a swarm of usvs consequently we mainly aim at resolving a swarm of usvs collision avoidance problem wherein usv maneuverability navigation rules obstacles motion characteristics and cooperation among a swarm of usvs would be followed with interest following that a collision avoidance approach using a negotiation protocol is proposed to remedy the defects of traditional collision avoidance methods an on board negotiation protocol is presented to process collision avoidance under complicated collision situations it is noteworthy that in mixed situations that conventional ships remotely controlled ships and usvs exist at the same time in general ships should abide by colregs under the requirements of imo to ensure that different types of ships can avoid collision some highlights of our paper are 1 the collision avoidance problem under complicated encounter situations is proposed for a swarm of usvs wherein usv control model and collision avoidance rules are established 2 under the mobile ad hoc network manet framework an negotiation protocol is designed to cope with complicated collision avoidance issue for a swarm of usvs finally a collision avoidance system based on negotiation protocol is formed and its efficiency is confirmed by numerical simulation under various scenarios the remainder of the paper is organized as following section 2 details usv motion model and collision avoidance rules model section 3 proposes a negotiation protocol for dealing with a swarm of usvs collision avoidance under complicated environment section 4 presents illustrative numerical examples for a swarm of usvs under generous complex encounter situations using the proposed approach finally section 5 concludes this paper 2 problem formulations to guarantee the safety of usv navigation and achieve autonomous collision avoidance for a swarm of usvs the motion and usv coordinate system model are established firstly following that usv collision avoidance rules are quantified and incorporated in the collision avoidance process finally we detail the problem formulation of a swarm of usvs collision avoidance 2 1 usv coordinate system suppose usvs are equipped with gps devices and radio modem communication equipment and power plants including rear electric propellers and rudder blades all those equipments contribute to autonomous navigation capability of the swarm of usvs in essence with the aid of equipped devices each usv gains its longitude and latitude positions λ ϕ during the navigation period to simplify the calculation by utilizing mercator projection a global coordinate system x 0 o 0 y 0 is adopted to convert geographic coordinates into cartesian coordinate system referring to the mapping relationship between the geographic coordinates and x 0 o 0 y 0 the equator eastward and meridian line northward directions are defined as forward directions of o x 0 and o y 0 axes respectively zhu et al 2020 and the intersection of the equator and the prime meridian is defined as the origin point o 0 and then referring to the illustration of the navigation states and the surrounding environment of u s v i a coordinate system x o y is established for usv as shown in fig 1 suppose u s v i is the i t h usv in x 0 o 0 y 0 and its length and width are l i and w i respectively u s v i is positioned at p x i p y i in x 0 o 0 y 0 and characterized by heading c i speed v i and rudder angle δ i wherein p x i p y i is the center of x o y o y and o x axes represent the heading direction of usv and the correspondingly perpendicular starboard beam direction respectively the relative azimuth angle θ j can be the clockwise azimuth from the heading direction to obstacle u s v j when it comes to the surrounding obstacles of u s v i all the analysis would be achieved in x o y and its motion situation is performed to fulfill the avoidance decision the motion attributes and corresponding position relation of usvs in x 0 o 0 y 0 are illustrated in fig 2 a following that the motion attributes of surrounding u s v j related to u s v i in x o y are as follows x j y j denotes the position of u s v j γ j is the azimuth of u s v j relative to u s v i c j and v j are the heading and speed of u s v j relative to u s v i respectively referring to u s v 0 from x 0 o 0 y 0 to x o y its surrounding usvs transformation formula can be derived by eq 1 and then with the aid of eq 1 fig 2 b presents the transformed effect 1 x j y j p x j p x i p y j p y i t cos c i sin c i sin c i cos c i c j c j c i v j v j γ j δ j θ j arctan y j x j 2 2 the quantification of motion model and collision avoidance rules the motion characteristics of usvs are similar with those of general vessels it is feasible to adopt nomoto equation for usv maneuvering motion equation and employ pid for the independent heading control algorithm by controlling rudder angles the heading of usv can be adjusted flexibly suppose k 0 t 0 k p k i and k d represent the turning stability proportional integral and differential coefficients respectively e k c t and c k sequentially denote the k t h heading deviation the target heading and the k t h heading angle δ 0 t δ u k and δ k are correspondingly the initial rudder angle the sampling period the k t h rudder angle increment and the k t h rudder angle derived from nomoto equation and pid algorithm the control equation of usv can be 2 e k c t c k 3 c k c k 1 k 0 δ 0 t t 0 t 0 e t t 0 4 δ u k k p t k i k d t e k k p 2 k d t e k 1 k d t e k 2 5 δ k δ k 1 δ u k referring to the heading of usv suppose its initial heading is c 0 the k t h sampling heading is c k and the final sampling heading is c t as shown in fig 3 when usv starts to turn to starboard suppose α is the turning angle a d is the advance distance and its physics signification is that the longitudinal distance changes against the original position of usv following that a d can be k 0 t v cos c k when it comes to the encounter situation involving each 2 usvs under the condition that if only one usv executes collision avoidance operation it is significant to double the advance distance a d as the dangerous distance s of usv consequently s 2 a d can be selected as the minimum collision avoidance distance according to which at least one usv starts to perform collision avoidance activities apart from usv maneuverability featured by its motion model each usv should abide by the international regulations for preventing collisions at sea colregs within which the convention on collision avoidance under encounter situation has been specified in detail tam and bucknall 2013 naeem et al 2012 as demonstrated in fig 4 in x o y there are 3 encounter situations including head on crossing and overtaking and crossing situation consists of port crossing and starboard crossing it is meaningful that we can make the minimum collision spacing d c no less than l between usvs to guarantee any 2 usvs against collision in the process of navigation similar to ref zhou et al 2015 minimum safe distance d m can be 2l referring to the complex collision avoidance situations of a swarm of usvs we present the quantification of rules correspondingly details can be referred to appendix a 2 3 the solution of collision avoidance for a swarm of usvs it is critical for a swarm of usvs achieving collision free navigation during collision avoidance process consequently a soundable and reliable solution is indispensable for a swarm of usvs to resolve the chaotic state leading by different motion situations of each usv in general there exist generous of collision avoidance methods for only 2 vessels encounter situation little attention has been paid to collision avoidance solution for a swarm of usvs with complex motion relationships following that to track down the collision brought by the violation of colregs as a supplement and security confirmation of the tradition collision avoidance strategy a negotiation protocol is designed for the collision avoidance fulfillment of a swarm of usvs in section 3 3 the design of negotiation protocol for swarm of usvs usv can be avoided by colregs under normal situation but in some cases need to negotiate with usvs which affected by the surrounding usvs and make coordinated actions including the forced overtaking collision conflict leading by multiple usvs need to violate the collision avoidance rules the usvs negotiated to achieve the coordination of the collision avoidance actions between the usvs therefore a swarm of usvs negotiation communication protocol was proposed to solve the above problems the negotiation protocol is a supplement and security confirmation of the preceding group collision avoidance algorithm which compensates for the special situation of the uncoordinated decision and the usv decision conflict in the common avoidance method and improves the coordination and security of the avoidance and the negotiation content transferred through the negotiation protocol will be stored in files with signatures of each part as evidence if necessary 3 1 distributed negotiation network 3 1 1 negotiation network construction the usvs are relatively close in the encounter situation and can form a manet for communication meanwhile the nodes in the negotiation network constructed temporarily by usvs for collision avoidance have the characteristics of fast moving speed which leads to frequent changes in network topology and the manet can not meet the needs to solve above problem this paper proposes a collision avoidance ad hoc network caanet based on manet according to the characteristics of collision avoidance the caanet adopts the plane topological structure the message are from task node to task node in the caanet the simplification of communication mode greatly improves the efficiency of network routing it is worth noting wireless communication is adopted between usvs routing information is likely to leak network topology and location information is easy to be exposed during navigation to prevent the caanet from being eavesdropped intruded or attacked this paper takes a series of measures firstly in the physical layer the effective modulation technology is used to resist the wireless channel interference and the virtual private network and encryption node are used to prevent network eavesdropping in the network layer secure routing technology is used to prevent network intrusion and malicious node identification technology is used to prevent phishing attacks in the application layer information encryption technology is used to deal with information tampering when it comes to the communication protocol the protocol stack is constructed with consider of the task characteristics the caanet does not rely on its own infrastructure and nodes access the network frequently mac layer mainly solves the problem of allocating channel access when the common channel in the network competes in the physical layer mac layer it is suitable to choose the access mode based on competition mechanism as a result ieee 802 11a protocol is selected destination sequenced distance vector routing is selected for the network layer to deal with the rapid movement of nodes frequent changes in network topology extremely unstable links between nodes and uncertainty in the movement of usv the access mode of the node directly affects the networking speed of caanet 3 1 2 underlying communication model as shown in fig 5 usv negotiation is the processes that improve common views or joint planning by structurally exchanging relevant information negotiating is the process by which a swarm of usvs reduce inconsistencies or uncertainties in order to reach consensus each usv is equipped with radio modem and software radio technology as the underlying communication model and has a unique maritime mobile service identification mmsi when negotiating with the surrounding usvs the negotiation initiator automatically establishes a point to multipoint star topology network with the usvs which in the range s and simultaneously sends a negotiation communication request to the nodes in the network details shown in algorithm 1 through the process the usv can set up a negotiation communication network quickly and provide the basis of network communication for the subsequent negotiation process giving rising to the excellent upgrade of current hardware industry real time situation awareness and judgment of each usv vessel can be achieved with ease when uncertainty factors affect collision avoidance issue vessels will re quantify the encounter situation in time and re make grouping and negotiation behaviors according to the affected encounter situation under the rules of colregs consequently the above real time performance of situation awareness can effectively eliminate the negative impact of the uncertainty in situation awareness algorithm 1 the construction process of us v 0 negotiated communication network image 1 based on the research of vehicular ad hoc networks noori 2012 the usv is equipped with wireless data transmission station radio modem transmission station as the underlying communication hardware and the radio modem station uses digital signal processing technology and software radio technology realizes high performance long distance data transmission with forward error correction equalization soft decision and other functions its transmission rate can reach 19 2 kbps transmission and reception conversion time is less than 10 ms low cost strong diffraction ability networking structure is flexible and the coverage is long it is suitable for occasions with many points and scattered and the geographical environment is complex from the analysis of the performance characteristics of the above radio modem station it can be applied to the real time communication of the swarm of usvs in the range of minimum collision avoidance distance s the radio modem station can communicate in the form of point to multipoint networking the modem station has one master station another is a substation and the data is transmitted by using the data frame with the device mmsi the modem station sends the signal to the substation in broadcast forms the substation radio modem station can receive this signal and each station receiving the signal parses the data to determine whether the address information in the data frame matches the slave device address and if it matches the received data is processed if not then the data is discarded different responses are made according to the data or commands and the response data is sent back the point to multipoint networking characteristics and communication methods of digital radio stations have strong adaptability to the swarm of usvs collision avoidance situation therefore it is very suitable to use radio modem technology as the underlying model in this section based on the technology of the radio modem the negotiation protocol in the communication process is designed to complete the negotiation process of usvs due to the limitation of computing and communication resources the impact of future behavior of other vehicles is not directly stressed however it is worth noting that those above vehicles who make future impacts on any other vehicles would form a newly upcoming encounter situation jointly in essence from this perspective any encounter situation can be resolved in our approach and then the impacts of future behavior of other vehicles can be well dealt with 3 2 collision avoidance negotiation process 3 2 1 negotiation communication process and negotiation primitive design after the negotiation network is completed the usv that initiated the negotiation will start negotiating with usvs that needs to be negotiated first a negotiation request is sent the request frame includes the mmsi of the initiator the mmsi of the target usv and the status and additional information of the negotiation request when the surrounding usv receives the first mmsi if the verification is successful the usv is sent to the sender and establish a communication connection otherwise discard the negotiation request packet directly the framework and process of the specific communication negotiation request are as shown in fig 6 to obtain the final decision result with the minimum number of interactions during the negotiation process a negotiation primitive used in the communication process is designed the primitive uses the mmsi of the usv as the unique identification code and includes negotiation status and plan set information of negotiation process primitive frame as shown in table 1 among them ask one means to send to a single usv sender means message sender its value is sender mmsi receiver is message receiver its value is receiver mmsi message id is represented as a negotiation process sequence number and it is represented by the integer n the state indicates the primitive negotiation state and is divided into four states begin finish ask agree and disagree the time stamp indicates the negotiation time stamp and the schedule indicates the planned sequence set which is stored in the planned sequence p t where p t represents the sequence of avoidance actions to be taken by the usv sending the negotiation message such as turning to port for 5 and then turning to port for 15 the data format of each phase of the negotiation frame is as shown in the following fig 7 the designed frame can guarantee the judgment of the integrity of the communication data effectively once the data frame is incomplete the message receiver sends the data request signal to the message sender and correspondingly the message sender will send the data frame to the message receiver once again the process of applying negotiation primitive negotiate can be summarized as a perception intention decision model in fig 8 perception is to obtain the negotiation information from the environment and enter the system the intention is to achieve the goal and effect of usv in the current environment and the decision is a process which matching and comparing the perceptual information with the usv intended plan sequence then obtain the maximum matching value the above negotiation communication framework can be running in the radio modem network the normal operation of the usv decision negotiation is also inseparable from the internal negotiation mechanism the finite state machine can make the negotiation process orderly remark 1 when it is impossible to achieve collision avoidance according to the colregs and some vehicles are not able to negotiate we consider that it should rely on the onboard equipment and general rules including sensors and actuators of vessels accordingly encounter situations can be obtained on the basis of the analysis of data from onboard sensors and then vessels perform the collision avoidance actions through onboard actuators while abiding by the relevant collision avoidance rules in general usvs and small scale vessels have better maneuverability than manned ships and large scale vessels following that when it comes to the encounter situation the ordinary vessels should yield to the vessels with emergency missions the usvs should yield to the manned ships and small scale vessels should yield to large scale vessels 3 2 2 negotiation strategy and finite state automaton the negotiation protocol is an auto negotiation process that describes the subject in a structured way it describes in detail the various possibilities for initializing a negotiation loop and response message the simplest negotiation protocol is defined in the form of negotiation primitive negotiation protocol possible sequence of negotiated behaviors the swarm of usvs negotiation network designed in this paper is defined as a finite state automaton and thus the non monotonicity and intentional convergence in the negotiation process are generated the usv intelligence entities in the negotiation system all have a common global goal and each subject has local targets that coordinate with the global goals in order to characterize the intention and purpose of the usv negotiation a set of planning sequences is designed in the negotiation primitives indicating the maneuvering plan of the usv in the future period applying the local reasoning method to formulate the plan set and sent to the negotiation object during the negotiation process based on the above negotiation theory a negotiation strategy is designed to indicate the success of negotiation and the method of negotiation decision exchange after the negotiation network is built the usv state changes to active each time of negotiation process is made the local cost matrix c o s t is updated the cost matrix indicates a cost of collision that the current usv and the target usv are in various encounter situations and various planned actions the cost of collision where the generation value represents the collision risk r i j i j 1 2 3 4 caused by the current state and the specific planned action the cost matrix c o s t form is as eq 6 6 c o s t r 11 r 12 r 13 r 14 r 21 r 22 r 23 r 24 r 31 r 32 r 33 r 34 r 41 r 42 r 43 r 44 where i is the state index the current usv and the negotiating usv are in the situation divided into head on starboard cross port crossing and overtaking situation j is the action index the usv is doing the direction of the division the action is divided into the go ahead turn to starboard turn to port and speed change the r i j value indicates the risk value obtained by the current usv in the index of the j action when indexing the i state the risk calculation method refers to feng and li 2012 and adjusts the compute process according to the data format of the negotiation protocol and finally generate the cost value r i j according to calculation formula eq 7 7 r i j k 0 n α d c p a 2 β t c p a 2 subject to u s v k q t where q t 350 360 0 10 α β 0 1 0 5 q t 10 112 5 α β 1 0 5 q t 112 5 247 5 α β 0 2 0 2 q t 247 5 350 α β 0 8 0 5 where d c p a and t c p a represent the distance to closest point of approach and time to closest point of approach of the usv and the passively negotiated usv respectively which rely on the parameters of usvs α represents the factor of d c p a β represents the factor of t c p a and k represents the index of the u s v k according to the usv encounter field q t the sum of their risk values are summed as the overall risk value in this field algorithm 2 is described as a finite state automaton which shown in fig 9 u s v 0 as a negotiation initiator to negotiate communication with u s v 1 if u s v 1 is constrained by navigation constraints the planned sequence set p t of u s v 1 will not include restricted behavior in the step match schedule in case of conflict between negotiation behavior of u s v 0 and navigation restriction of u s v 1 u s v 1 will reject negotiation and then u s v 0 and u s v 1 will negotiate new behaviors to complete collision avoidance in addition if the dynamic constraint conflicts with the negotiated results for collision avoidance vessels will reject the above results and following that vessels tend to negotiate a new result to fulfill the maneuvering requirements wherein dynamic constraints should be satisfied as much as possible u s v 1 calculates the c o s t and matches the planned sequence set p t in the u s v 0 negotiation message the detailed communication negotiation policy and protocol state transition process are as fig 10 a algorithm 2 the computing state of negotiation process image 2 moreover the primary purpose and maneuverability of vessels is considered in order to strengthen the performance of the negotiation protocol the priority of mission types and the grade of vessel maneuverability are stressed properly tam and bucknall 2013 furthermore vessels with low priority missions should yield to those with high priority and the vessels with high maneuverability should yield to those with low maneuverability for example if there are transport vessel mapping surveying vessel and surveillance vessel they will be classified according to the importance of their missions as shown in table 2 when the transport vessel tries to negotiate with the mapping surveying vessel the transport vessel sends a data frame with its priority of mission is 3 and its planned sequence p t t r a n s then the mapping surveying vessel compares their priorities of missions its own priority is larger than that of the transport vessel the mapping surveying vessel rejects the negotiation request of the transport vessel and replies a data frame with its priority of mission is 2 and its planned sequence p t m a p p the transport vessel reschedules its planned sequence p t t r a n s and notifies the mapping surveying vessel and if there are sailboats people in kayaks fishing and leisure boats they shall be classified according to the maneuverability correspondingly as shown in table 3 3 3 negotiation conflict resolution case in 1992 bussman and muller proposed a negotiation model bussmann and muller 1992 for a two level process in which a pure negotiation loop and a conflict resolution strategy were run in parallel the pure negotiation model proposes a solution for a specific conflict then compares and analyzes other solutions according to their own preferences refreshes the solution space and the corresponding preference table the conflict resolution strategy determines the conflict and plans a solution for the conflict the negotiation communication model defines the behavior of the negotiation subject in the negotiation process it can be abstracted using concepts such as policies and preferences and use the cost comparison function to calculate the final negotiation result in order to verify the effectiveness of the negotiation protocol strategy for collision avoidance of group unmanned boats this section designs a case of group unmanned boat application negotiation protocol to resolve conflict resolution referring to the navigation state in fig 10 b there are four usvs including u s v 0 u s v 1 u s v 2 and u s v 3 after that u s v 0 initiates a negotiation request to the surrounding usvs and construct a star topology network according to the colregs u s v 0 should turn to starboard to avoid collision with u s v 1 whereas it should turn to port to avoid u s v 1 based on the grouping strategy thus u s v 0 sends a negotiation decision format frame to the starboard u s v 2 after received the negotiation frame u s v 2 calculates and returns the negotiation result on the basis of above negotiation protocol if u s v 0 receives the u s v 2 negotiation agreement format frame it sends a decision result to u s v 1 if u s v 1 matches the cost matrix and then agrees to the decision result it sends a negotiation agreement format frame to u s v 0 if the negotiation rejection format frame is received u s v 0 decelerates the navigation u s v 2 is based on the grouping algorithm calculates the steering angle because the u s v 3 is not affected by the decision during the negotiation process the actual collision avoidance process is not affected by u s v 0 so it does not participate in the negotiation with u s v 0 finally u s v 0 releases the resources of negotiation network so far a negotiation has been completed the sequence diagram fig 11 is shown the negotiation process for the above situation it can be seen from the above cases that although the negotiated network constructed is a one to many relationship the negotiation process is carried out in a step by step manner with the negotiation initiator as the negotiation center start with usv which depart from the rules and end with usv which affected by the target action then the usvs form a linear negotiation relationship through the negotiation center this design ensures that the usv in the negotiation network can negotiate according to certain logic and finally ensure usvs safety make the final goal of usvs consistent complete the coordinated collision avoidance of the swarm of usvs remark 2 to solve the problem of usv collision avoidance coordination this paper uses the negotiation method to judge the risk of collision and uses c o s t to combine the usv dangerous state and the negotiation protocol r i j is used to mark the dangerous state of each division of the current usv meanwhile a negotiation protocol is designed to update the dangerous state so that the usv can sense the change of the dangerous state and realize the collision avoidance coordination of the usvs 4 numerical simulation to verify the effectiveness of our approach via negotiation protocol for usvs simulations under generous scenarios for a swarm of usvs are carried out in x 0 o 0 y 0 system suppose the parameters of the usvs are l 5 m w 2 m k 0 2 t 0 5 k p 0 8 k i 5 and k d 10 following that d m can be 10 m fig 12 a presents the heading angles c and rudder angles δ variations of a usv when it turns from c 0 to c 30 without wind and current and its shows that when time is around 15 s c and δ are converged toward 30 and 0 respectively referring to the usv we set its v 0 16 kn c 0 0 and p x i p y i 0 0 if the turning angles of the usv can be 5 10 30 60 respectively and then corresponding targeted trajectories are demonstrated in fig 12 b and the steering distance a d maintains around 0 2 nm 4 1 collision avoidance simulation for a swarm of usvs 4 1 1 comparison with the schema in tam and bucknall 2013 under complex scenarios with 5 usvs in tam and bucknall 2013 a deterministic path planning algorithm was presented to computes a practical and colregs compliant navigation path for vessels collision avoidance and simulations for various traffic scenarios were designed to evaluate different aspects of the proposed algorithm to validate the effectiveness of our approach simulation case in tam and bucknall 2013 with 5 usvs is selected for comparison where in collision avoidance among the usvs and maneuverability of the usvs should be concerned consequently it is meaningful that the chosen scenarios are ideal for comparison and details can be referred to tam and bucknall 2013 table 4 shows the scenarios of the usvs fig 13 presents variation of p x i p y i c δ v and d i j of 5 usvs during the collision avoidance process fig 13 shows that in the selected case there are 4 classical encounter situations belong to colregs rules including head on overtaking crossing from port and starboard each usv would experience several types of encounter situations during collision avoidance process for instance u s v 1 would be encountered with the situation of head on with u s v 3 overtaking u s v 2 port crossing with u s v 4 and starboard crossing with u s v 5 the distance between usvs decreases from 1s to 55s as shown in fig 13 a in 55s the coordinates of u s v 1 u s v 2 u s v 3 u s v 4 and u s v 5 are 0 192 0 110 0 200 0 090 0 260 0 085 0 210 0 140 0 196 0 160 respectively although the final trajectories of usvs are crossed there exists no collision it can be found that in fig 13 b the distance between usvs gradually increases after 55s it is obvious that there is no collision between usvs in the whole collision avoidance progress comparison of our simulation results and those from tam and bucknall 2013 indicates our collision avoidance operation will be more natural as for figs 13 a and 5 usvs were originally under complex encounter situations but their overall situations change by applying our collision avoidance algorithm after a period 40s u s v 1 and u s v 2 were in the same group and they finally turned to port departure from rules for collision avoidance due to there being collision risk of u s v 5 at their starboard sides u s v 3 and u s v 4 turned to starboard for slight avoidance operation thus their situations may be simplified quickly as opposed to those simulation results tam and bucknall 2013 encounter situations between usvs were taken into account here together with their speeds whose duration curves shown in fig 13 e indicate that their speeds converge eventually due to the effect of our grouping strategy moreover their heading also tended closely the overall collision avoidance decision will be adjusted as situations changes simulation results show that safe avoidance and voyage achieved for 5 usvs after 125s and our avoidance operation effects will be more natural and fluent with reference to the planning path from tam and bucknall 2013 swarm of usvs dynamically adjusted their headings and speeds during the collision avoidance process avoidance decisions will change or be adjusted in view of changing situations to cope with the complex collision avoidance environment 4 1 2 negotiation aided avoidance simulation avoidance may usually be performed only in accordance with avoidance rules however negotiations with the surrounding usvs can be taken in some special cases to reduce unnecessary avoidance operations so that the avoidance effect can be better and the initial usv state shown in table 5 the collision avoidance trajectories and encounter situations fig 14 indicate the initial u s v 0 under the port and starboard crossing situations will substantially turn to starboard for avoidance but u s v 0 turned to port depart from colregs for avoidance after performance of communication negotiations with other usvs while u s v 0 and u s v 1 were under the port crossing situation u s v 0 also turned to port in a great range for avoidance then all the usvs can prevent collision successful such case fully reflects the negotiation protocol acts in concert during a changing situation process to lower those unnecessary avoidance operations and rapidly simplify the encounter situations thus avoidance and safe voyage of usvs can be guaranteed ref zhao et al 2016 presented an optimal reciprocal collision avoidance algorithm to real time collision avoidance with the compliance to the colregs for multiple usvs in which all the obstacles in the collision avoidance scenes have their independent autonomy the approach conforms to a practical marine situation for fully reflecting effects of the negotiation protocol during avoidance processes avoidance simulation results of 4 usvs from zhao et al 2016 for comparison motion situations were initialized to be similar with those from zhao et al 2016 for simulation of usvs the usvs initial state shown in table 6 comparison of simulation results of such case and those from zhao et al 2016 indicates that the improved obstacle avoidance algorithm was applied in zhao et al 2016 on the other hand the additional negotiation protocol was utilized here to simplify encounter situations during the avoidance processes in view of simulation results which shown in fig 15 u s v 1 will form the crossing encounter situation with u s v 4 then it will form the head on encounter situation with u s v 2 the collision avoidance algorithm can be utilized for analysis of the entire situations during the avoidance processes and those usvs whose motion situations are similar are incorporated in a group in fig 15 each usv has its independent autonomy u s v 1 takes a left turn to avoid u s v 4 than it avoiding the head on encounter with u s v 2 which illustrates that the collision avoidance approach via negotiation protocol can reduce collision risk to some extent the 4 usvs were originally under encounter and port and starboard crossing situations the negotiation protocol was applied to u s v 1 to turn to port depart from rules for avoidance of u s v 2 and u s v 3 and u s v 2 and u s v 4 turned to gradually be in the same group during the avoidance process because avoidance situations were changing though simulation results deviated greatly from the planning target point avoidance and negotiation by turning in a relatively large range and being depart from rules behave excellently here simulation results suggest that negotiations with those affected usvs can be performed to do compatible operation and eventually achieve avoidance while departure from rules is required 4 2 analysis of simulation results it can be found that by completing our approach excellent collision avoidance decisions are generated and a swarm of usvs can fulfill conflict free navigation ideally as for cases 2 and 3 section 4 1 2 where the negotiation protocol was applied navigation may come true for usv depart from the rules so that their avoidance operation can be slightly small and safer the coordinated operation can be perfectly implemented in case of necessary departure from rules as for application of the agreement protocol simulation results indicate that the negotiation protocol method may achieve safe avoidance in case of any large traffic flow 5 conclusions this paper stresses the collision avoidance problems for a swarm usvs by employing a collision avoidance approach based on a negotiation protocol a collision avoidance ad hoc network and corresponding protocol stack are proposed for the negotiation communication between usvs to strengthen the ability of the approach under complex collision avoidance conditions we put forward a negotiation protocol for usvs simulations under generous scenarios verify the effectiveness of our approach for solving the collision avoidance problems for a swarm of usvs in the near future with the aid of our collision avoidance approach for a swarm of usvs the collision avoidance platform for a swarm of usvs with environment disturbance can be built up and utilized

a quantification of rules 1 the same group safe speed among a swarm of usvs while usvs sail close to a dangerous distance density of the same group usv can be ρ a d where a and d are the coverage area and the average spacing of the same group usvs respectively while ρ l 2 d m the usv will slow down to flow its front usv thus d c won t come true against its front usv in its given forward direction 2 collision avoidance operation the collision avoidance operation is adjusted in accordance with the current density speed and position relative to the surrounding usvs for any usv to guarantee d m and collision avoidance operation will be confined to a range as small as possible 3 while any two usvs sail close to s an encounter situation may possibly occur head on while the motion target is within the range of 10 to the heading and the included angle of their heading is within the range of 6 it is regarded as the head on situation while it departures from the rules to be more appropriate for the current situation collision avoidance will occur departure rules port crossing the motion target is relatively within the range 247 5 350 and the motion target s heading is crossing with its heading the collision risk will be judged on the basis of the motion tendency if there exists any risk it turns to starboard by a proper angle for collision avoidance otherwise it will be appropriately departure from rules and measures will be taken for collision avoidance starboard crossing while the relative azimuth angle is within the range 10 112 5 and the motion target s heading is crossing with its heading motion trends of surrounding usvs are calculated while it turns to starboard to achieve collision avoidance it turns in accordance with the calculated steering angle otherwise it departures from rules to take collision avoidance operation in favor of the current situation overtaking in general overtaking will not be allowed during collision avoidance process while the current situation requires overtaking must be taken the actively overtaking usv will communicate with overtaking usvs using negotiation protocol 
20976,for solving collision avoidance issue of a swarm of unmanned surface vehicles usvs under complex situations a collision avoidance approach using a negotiation protocol for usvs is proposed to fulfill the collision avoidance we first discuss the maneuverability encounter situation division then a collision avoidance ad hoc network is constructed for the negotiation communication between usvs moreover to cope with complex collision avoidance situations an usv negotiation protocol is designed simulations under generous complex scenarios are carried out to validate the effectiveness of our approach results verify that our approach is effective and reliable for resolving the problem of a swarm of usvs collision avoidance keywords unmanned surface vehicles negotiation protocol encounter situation division collision avoidance ad hoc network complex collision avoidance 1 introduction along with continuous development of emerging intelligent control and motion planning technologies zhao et al 2020 unmanned surface vehicle usv is featured by flexible maneuverability and excellent autonomy and then is capable of autonomous navigation due to its huge potential applications usv plays an ever increasing important role in both military and civil fields including maritime management search and rescue marine science survey reconnaissance and attack mission etc ma et al 2018 zhao et al 1109 during executing the above tasks at sea it is significant that the safety of usv should be guaranteed consequently automatic collision avoidance issues of the usv should be effectively stressed many techniques have been generated for the collision avoidance problem of a single usv shi et al 2019 ref zhao et al 2016 conducted an optimal collision avoidance method on the basis of vector obstacles for usv under the guidance of colregs rules and validated its effectiveness by numerical simulation under elementary scenarios from the perspective of unsymmetrical ship domain encounter situations of usv were analyzed in johansen et al 2016 which supplied an aid to the quantification of motion model and collision avoidance rules ref ma et al 2019 introduced a trajectory tracking control method for surface ship and provided a reference for the motion control of usv when it comes to collision avoidance problem of a swarm of usvs lots of factors including maneuverability of the usv motion state of the obstacle navigation rules at sea should be addressed with the increasing of the number of usvs it is imperative to center the problem of distributed control peng et al 2017 under the guidance of navigation rules a series of analyses on collision avoidance simulation for vessels was conducted in lušić and čorić 2015 referring to collision avoidance strategy for usv a decomposition coordination method was put forward for simulating optimal steering angle while 4 vessels were approaching together zou 2010 with the aid of fuzzy semantic knowledge method environmental information was converted for analysis to generate a collision avoidance strategy eventually ali et al 2015 ref naeem et al 2012 employed a pid system for usv motion control and presented a collision avoidance strategy while subordinated to colregs rules general ant colony optimization was adopted for planning collision avoidance paths for vessels at sea lazarowska 2015 whereas the computation time was long and reached paths were unstable classical a algorithm was utilized for collision avoidance in lee et al 2004 wherein motion characteristics of obstacles were oversimplified referring to the protocol for usv collision avoidance a protocol based collision avoidance method was proposed for usvs with the aid of multi objective optimization benjamin et al 2006 it can be observed that ref benjamin et al 2006 focused on the collision avoidance between usvs under the framework of colregs whereas in this paper in order to take into account the unspecified collision avoidance in the colregs we tend to design the suitable negotiation protocol for collision avoidance problem of a swarm of usvs furthermore it is significant that communication is critical for collision avoidance benjamin et al 2006 hsu et al 2009 ma et al 1109 ref qiu and duan 2020 proposed a control frame that renders the many objective optimization problem into a multi objective optimization problem then based on the frame to solve safety problems ref ji et al 2014 focused on reaching group consensus for linearly coupled multi agent networks by employing linear protocols a proposed concrete group communication protocol can guarantee safe and reliable communication between individuals in the same group li and zhang 2017 which is of great significance for the approach via negotiation protocol a distributed stochastic search algorithm was implemented for multi vessel encounter situations wherein intentions and negotiations between vessels were addressed properly kim et al 2017 ref kim et al 2017 offered a favor to the communication between negotiation vessels in the light of the fuzzy inference system ref bukhari et al 2013 designed a vessel collision risk assessment system to calculate the degree of collision risk among all vessels it achieved the collision risk in negotiation protocol ref shao et al 2019 designed a novel cooperative platform for coupled usv uav systems and demonstrated that the framework design method of the communication data was essential for the negotiation protocol an excellent approach composed of a parameterized method and conflict resolution was introduced for multiple mobile robots motion planning under a time varying environment ma et al 2012 ref ma et al 2014 elucidated an intelligent algorithm to resolve multiple mobile robots routing issue under double warehouse scene and provided a reference for the selection of collision avoidance behaviors it is significant that the above research offers an excellent reference for our focused collision avoidance problem of a swarm of usvs it can be seen that significant progresses have been achieved on single usv collision avoidance issue whereas the above concerned issue could not reflect the practical motion environment roundly and little attention has been paid to the collision avoidance issue for a swarm of usvs consequently we mainly aim at resolving a swarm of usvs collision avoidance problem wherein usv maneuverability navigation rules obstacles motion characteristics and cooperation among a swarm of usvs would be followed with interest following that a collision avoidance approach using a negotiation protocol is proposed to remedy the defects of traditional collision avoidance methods an on board negotiation protocol is presented to process collision avoidance under complicated collision situations it is noteworthy that in mixed situations that conventional ships remotely controlled ships and usvs exist at the same time in general ships should abide by colregs under the requirements of imo to ensure that different types of ships can avoid collision some highlights of our paper are 1 the collision avoidance problem under complicated encounter situations is proposed for a swarm of usvs wherein usv control model and collision avoidance rules are established 2 under the mobile ad hoc network manet framework an negotiation protocol is designed to cope with complicated collision avoidance issue for a swarm of usvs finally a collision avoidance system based on negotiation protocol is formed and its efficiency is confirmed by numerical simulation under various scenarios the remainder of the paper is organized as following section 2 details usv motion model and collision avoidance rules model section 3 proposes a negotiation protocol for dealing with a swarm of usvs collision avoidance under complicated environment section 4 presents illustrative numerical examples for a swarm of usvs under generous complex encounter situations using the proposed approach finally section 5 concludes this paper 2 problem formulations to guarantee the safety of usv navigation and achieve autonomous collision avoidance for a swarm of usvs the motion and usv coordinate system model are established firstly following that usv collision avoidance rules are quantified and incorporated in the collision avoidance process finally we detail the problem formulation of a swarm of usvs collision avoidance 2 1 usv coordinate system suppose usvs are equipped with gps devices and radio modem communication equipment and power plants including rear electric propellers and rudder blades all those equipments contribute to autonomous navigation capability of the swarm of usvs in essence with the aid of equipped devices each usv gains its longitude and latitude positions λ ϕ during the navigation period to simplify the calculation by utilizing mercator projection a global coordinate system x 0 o 0 y 0 is adopted to convert geographic coordinates into cartesian coordinate system referring to the mapping relationship between the geographic coordinates and x 0 o 0 y 0 the equator eastward and meridian line northward directions are defined as forward directions of o x 0 and o y 0 axes respectively zhu et al 2020 and the intersection of the equator and the prime meridian is defined as the origin point o 0 and then referring to the illustration of the navigation states and the surrounding environment of u s v i a coordinate system x o y is established for usv as shown in fig 1 suppose u s v i is the i t h usv in x 0 o 0 y 0 and its length and width are l i and w i respectively u s v i is positioned at p x i p y i in x 0 o 0 y 0 and characterized by heading c i speed v i and rudder angle δ i wherein p x i p y i is the center of x o y o y and o x axes represent the heading direction of usv and the correspondingly perpendicular starboard beam direction respectively the relative azimuth angle θ j can be the clockwise azimuth from the heading direction to obstacle u s v j when it comes to the surrounding obstacles of u s v i all the analysis would be achieved in x o y and its motion situation is performed to fulfill the avoidance decision the motion attributes and corresponding position relation of usvs in x 0 o 0 y 0 are illustrated in fig 2 a following that the motion attributes of surrounding u s v j related to u s v i in x o y are as follows x j y j denotes the position of u s v j γ j is the azimuth of u s v j relative to u s v i c j and v j are the heading and speed of u s v j relative to u s v i respectively referring to u s v 0 from x 0 o 0 y 0 to x o y its surrounding usvs transformation formula can be derived by eq 1 and then with the aid of eq 1 fig 2 b presents the transformed effect 1 x j y j p x j p x i p y j p y i t cos c i sin c i sin c i cos c i c j c j c i v j v j γ j δ j θ j arctan y j x j 2 2 the quantification of motion model and collision avoidance rules the motion characteristics of usvs are similar with those of general vessels it is feasible to adopt nomoto equation for usv maneuvering motion equation and employ pid for the independent heading control algorithm by controlling rudder angles the heading of usv can be adjusted flexibly suppose k 0 t 0 k p k i and k d represent the turning stability proportional integral and differential coefficients respectively e k c t and c k sequentially denote the k t h heading deviation the target heading and the k t h heading angle δ 0 t δ u k and δ k are correspondingly the initial rudder angle the sampling period the k t h rudder angle increment and the k t h rudder angle derived from nomoto equation and pid algorithm the control equation of usv can be 2 e k c t c k 3 c k c k 1 k 0 δ 0 t t 0 t 0 e t t 0 4 δ u k k p t k i k d t e k k p 2 k d t e k 1 k d t e k 2 5 δ k δ k 1 δ u k referring to the heading of usv suppose its initial heading is c 0 the k t h sampling heading is c k and the final sampling heading is c t as shown in fig 3 when usv starts to turn to starboard suppose α is the turning angle a d is the advance distance and its physics signification is that the longitudinal distance changes against the original position of usv following that a d can be k 0 t v cos c k when it comes to the encounter situation involving each 2 usvs under the condition that if only one usv executes collision avoidance operation it is significant to double the advance distance a d as the dangerous distance s of usv consequently s 2 a d can be selected as the minimum collision avoidance distance according to which at least one usv starts to perform collision avoidance activities apart from usv maneuverability featured by its motion model each usv should abide by the international regulations for preventing collisions at sea colregs within which the convention on collision avoidance under encounter situation has been specified in detail tam and bucknall 2013 naeem et al 2012 as demonstrated in fig 4 in x o y there are 3 encounter situations including head on crossing and overtaking and crossing situation consists of port crossing and starboard crossing it is meaningful that we can make the minimum collision spacing d c no less than l between usvs to guarantee any 2 usvs against collision in the process of navigation similar to ref zhou et al 2015 minimum safe distance d m can be 2l referring to the complex collision avoidance situations of a swarm of usvs we present the quantification of rules correspondingly details can be referred to appendix a 2 3 the solution of collision avoidance for a swarm of usvs it is critical for a swarm of usvs achieving collision free navigation during collision avoidance process consequently a soundable and reliable solution is indispensable for a swarm of usvs to resolve the chaotic state leading by different motion situations of each usv in general there exist generous of collision avoidance methods for only 2 vessels encounter situation little attention has been paid to collision avoidance solution for a swarm of usvs with complex motion relationships following that to track down the collision brought by the violation of colregs as a supplement and security confirmation of the tradition collision avoidance strategy a negotiation protocol is designed for the collision avoidance fulfillment of a swarm of usvs in section 3 3 the design of negotiation protocol for swarm of usvs usv can be avoided by colregs under normal situation but in some cases need to negotiate with usvs which affected by the surrounding usvs and make coordinated actions including the forced overtaking collision conflict leading by multiple usvs need to violate the collision avoidance rules the usvs negotiated to achieve the coordination of the collision avoidance actions between the usvs therefore a swarm of usvs negotiation communication protocol was proposed to solve the above problems the negotiation protocol is a supplement and security confirmation of the preceding group collision avoidance algorithm which compensates for the special situation of the uncoordinated decision and the usv decision conflict in the common avoidance method and improves the coordination and security of the avoidance and the negotiation content transferred through the negotiation protocol will be stored in files with signatures of each part as evidence if necessary 3 1 distributed negotiation network 3 1 1 negotiation network construction the usvs are relatively close in the encounter situation and can form a manet for communication meanwhile the nodes in the negotiation network constructed temporarily by usvs for collision avoidance have the characteristics of fast moving speed which leads to frequent changes in network topology and the manet can not meet the needs to solve above problem this paper proposes a collision avoidance ad hoc network caanet based on manet according to the characteristics of collision avoidance the caanet adopts the plane topological structure the message are from task node to task node in the caanet the simplification of communication mode greatly improves the efficiency of network routing it is worth noting wireless communication is adopted between usvs routing information is likely to leak network topology and location information is easy to be exposed during navigation to prevent the caanet from being eavesdropped intruded or attacked this paper takes a series of measures firstly in the physical layer the effective modulation technology is used to resist the wireless channel interference and the virtual private network and encryption node are used to prevent network eavesdropping in the network layer secure routing technology is used to prevent network intrusion and malicious node identification technology is used to prevent phishing attacks in the application layer information encryption technology is used to deal with information tampering when it comes to the communication protocol the protocol stack is constructed with consider of the task characteristics the caanet does not rely on its own infrastructure and nodes access the network frequently mac layer mainly solves the problem of allocating channel access when the common channel in the network competes in the physical layer mac layer it is suitable to choose the access mode based on competition mechanism as a result ieee 802 11a protocol is selected destination sequenced distance vector routing is selected for the network layer to deal with the rapid movement of nodes frequent changes in network topology extremely unstable links between nodes and uncertainty in the movement of usv the access mode of the node directly affects the networking speed of caanet 3 1 2 underlying communication model as shown in fig 5 usv negotiation is the processes that improve common views or joint planning by structurally exchanging relevant information negotiating is the process by which a swarm of usvs reduce inconsistencies or uncertainties in order to reach consensus each usv is equipped with radio modem and software radio technology as the underlying communication model and has a unique maritime mobile service identification mmsi when negotiating with the surrounding usvs the negotiation initiator automatically establishes a point to multipoint star topology network with the usvs which in the range s and simultaneously sends a negotiation communication request to the nodes in the network details shown in algorithm 1 through the process the usv can set up a negotiation communication network quickly and provide the basis of network communication for the subsequent negotiation process giving rising to the excellent upgrade of current hardware industry real time situation awareness and judgment of each usv vessel can be achieved with ease when uncertainty factors affect collision avoidance issue vessels will re quantify the encounter situation in time and re make grouping and negotiation behaviors according to the affected encounter situation under the rules of colregs consequently the above real time performance of situation awareness can effectively eliminate the negative impact of the uncertainty in situation awareness algorithm 1 the construction process of us v 0 negotiated communication network image 1 based on the research of vehicular ad hoc networks noori 2012 the usv is equipped with wireless data transmission station radio modem transmission station as the underlying communication hardware and the radio modem station uses digital signal processing technology and software radio technology realizes high performance long distance data transmission with forward error correction equalization soft decision and other functions its transmission rate can reach 19 2 kbps transmission and reception conversion time is less than 10 ms low cost strong diffraction ability networking structure is flexible and the coverage is long it is suitable for occasions with many points and scattered and the geographical environment is complex from the analysis of the performance characteristics of the above radio modem station it can be applied to the real time communication of the swarm of usvs in the range of minimum collision avoidance distance s the radio modem station can communicate in the form of point to multipoint networking the modem station has one master station another is a substation and the data is transmitted by using the data frame with the device mmsi the modem station sends the signal to the substation in broadcast forms the substation radio modem station can receive this signal and each station receiving the signal parses the data to determine whether the address information in the data frame matches the slave device address and if it matches the received data is processed if not then the data is discarded different responses are made according to the data or commands and the response data is sent back the point to multipoint networking characteristics and communication methods of digital radio stations have strong adaptability to the swarm of usvs collision avoidance situation therefore it is very suitable to use radio modem technology as the underlying model in this section based on the technology of the radio modem the negotiation protocol in the communication process is designed to complete the negotiation process of usvs due to the limitation of computing and communication resources the impact of future behavior of other vehicles is not directly stressed however it is worth noting that those above vehicles who make future impacts on any other vehicles would form a newly upcoming encounter situation jointly in essence from this perspective any encounter situation can be resolved in our approach and then the impacts of future behavior of other vehicles can be well dealt with 3 2 collision avoidance negotiation process 3 2 1 negotiation communication process and negotiation primitive design after the negotiation network is completed the usv that initiated the negotiation will start negotiating with usvs that needs to be negotiated first a negotiation request is sent the request frame includes the mmsi of the initiator the mmsi of the target usv and the status and additional information of the negotiation request when the surrounding usv receives the first mmsi if the verification is successful the usv is sent to the sender and establish a communication connection otherwise discard the negotiation request packet directly the framework and process of the specific communication negotiation request are as shown in fig 6 to obtain the final decision result with the minimum number of interactions during the negotiation process a negotiation primitive used in the communication process is designed the primitive uses the mmsi of the usv as the unique identification code and includes negotiation status and plan set information of negotiation process primitive frame as shown in table 1 among them ask one means to send to a single usv sender means message sender its value is sender mmsi receiver is message receiver its value is receiver mmsi message id is represented as a negotiation process sequence number and it is represented by the integer n the state indicates the primitive negotiation state and is divided into four states begin finish ask agree and disagree the time stamp indicates the negotiation time stamp and the schedule indicates the planned sequence set which is stored in the planned sequence p t where p t represents the sequence of avoidance actions to be taken by the usv sending the negotiation message such as turning to port for 5 and then turning to port for 15 the data format of each phase of the negotiation frame is as shown in the following fig 7 the designed frame can guarantee the judgment of the integrity of the communication data effectively once the data frame is incomplete the message receiver sends the data request signal to the message sender and correspondingly the message sender will send the data frame to the message receiver once again the process of applying negotiation primitive negotiate can be summarized as a perception intention decision model in fig 8 perception is to obtain the negotiation information from the environment and enter the system the intention is to achieve the goal and effect of usv in the current environment and the decision is a process which matching and comparing the perceptual information with the usv intended plan sequence then obtain the maximum matching value the above negotiation communication framework can be running in the radio modem network the normal operation of the usv decision negotiation is also inseparable from the internal negotiation mechanism the finite state machine can make the negotiation process orderly remark 1 when it is impossible to achieve collision avoidance according to the colregs and some vehicles are not able to negotiate we consider that it should rely on the onboard equipment and general rules including sensors and actuators of vessels accordingly encounter situations can be obtained on the basis of the analysis of data from onboard sensors and then vessels perform the collision avoidance actions through onboard actuators while abiding by the relevant collision avoidance rules in general usvs and small scale vessels have better maneuverability than manned ships and large scale vessels following that when it comes to the encounter situation the ordinary vessels should yield to the vessels with emergency missions the usvs should yield to the manned ships and small scale vessels should yield to large scale vessels 3 2 2 negotiation strategy and finite state automaton the negotiation protocol is an auto negotiation process that describes the subject in a structured way it describes in detail the various possibilities for initializing a negotiation loop and response message the simplest negotiation protocol is defined in the form of negotiation primitive negotiation protocol possible sequence of negotiated behaviors the swarm of usvs negotiation network designed in this paper is defined as a finite state automaton and thus the non monotonicity and intentional convergence in the negotiation process are generated the usv intelligence entities in the negotiation system all have a common global goal and each subject has local targets that coordinate with the global goals in order to characterize the intention and purpose of the usv negotiation a set of planning sequences is designed in the negotiation primitives indicating the maneuvering plan of the usv in the future period applying the local reasoning method to formulate the plan set and sent to the negotiation object during the negotiation process based on the above negotiation theory a negotiation strategy is designed to indicate the success of negotiation and the method of negotiation decision exchange after the negotiation network is built the usv state changes to active each time of negotiation process is made the local cost matrix c o s t is updated the cost matrix indicates a cost of collision that the current usv and the target usv are in various encounter situations and various planned actions the cost of collision where the generation value represents the collision risk r i j i j 1 2 3 4 caused by the current state and the specific planned action the cost matrix c o s t form is as eq 6 6 c o s t r 11 r 12 r 13 r 14 r 21 r 22 r 23 r 24 r 31 r 32 r 33 r 34 r 41 r 42 r 43 r 44 where i is the state index the current usv and the negotiating usv are in the situation divided into head on starboard cross port crossing and overtaking situation j is the action index the usv is doing the direction of the division the action is divided into the go ahead turn to starboard turn to port and speed change the r i j value indicates the risk value obtained by the current usv in the index of the j action when indexing the i state the risk calculation method refers to feng and li 2012 and adjusts the compute process according to the data format of the negotiation protocol and finally generate the cost value r i j according to calculation formula eq 7 7 r i j k 0 n α d c p a 2 β t c p a 2 subject to u s v k q t where q t 350 360 0 10 α β 0 1 0 5 q t 10 112 5 α β 1 0 5 q t 112 5 247 5 α β 0 2 0 2 q t 247 5 350 α β 0 8 0 5 where d c p a and t c p a represent the distance to closest point of approach and time to closest point of approach of the usv and the passively negotiated usv respectively which rely on the parameters of usvs α represents the factor of d c p a β represents the factor of t c p a and k represents the index of the u s v k according to the usv encounter field q t the sum of their risk values are summed as the overall risk value in this field algorithm 2 is described as a finite state automaton which shown in fig 9 u s v 0 as a negotiation initiator to negotiate communication with u s v 1 if u s v 1 is constrained by navigation constraints the planned sequence set p t of u s v 1 will not include restricted behavior in the step match schedule in case of conflict between negotiation behavior of u s v 0 and navigation restriction of u s v 1 u s v 1 will reject negotiation and then u s v 0 and u s v 1 will negotiate new behaviors to complete collision avoidance in addition if the dynamic constraint conflicts with the negotiated results for collision avoidance vessels will reject the above results and following that vessels tend to negotiate a new result to fulfill the maneuvering requirements wherein dynamic constraints should be satisfied as much as possible u s v 1 calculates the c o s t and matches the planned sequence set p t in the u s v 0 negotiation message the detailed communication negotiation policy and protocol state transition process are as fig 10 a algorithm 2 the computing state of negotiation process image 2 moreover the primary purpose and maneuverability of vessels is considered in order to strengthen the performance of the negotiation protocol the priority of mission types and the grade of vessel maneuverability are stressed properly tam and bucknall 2013 furthermore vessels with low priority missions should yield to those with high priority and the vessels with high maneuverability should yield to those with low maneuverability for example if there are transport vessel mapping surveying vessel and surveillance vessel they will be classified according to the importance of their missions as shown in table 2 when the transport vessel tries to negotiate with the mapping surveying vessel the transport vessel sends a data frame with its priority of mission is 3 and its planned sequence p t t r a n s then the mapping surveying vessel compares their priorities of missions its own priority is larger than that of the transport vessel the mapping surveying vessel rejects the negotiation request of the transport vessel and replies a data frame with its priority of mission is 2 and its planned sequence p t m a p p the transport vessel reschedules its planned sequence p t t r a n s and notifies the mapping surveying vessel and if there are sailboats people in kayaks fishing and leisure boats they shall be classified according to the maneuverability correspondingly as shown in table 3 3 3 negotiation conflict resolution case in 1992 bussman and muller proposed a negotiation model bussmann and muller 1992 for a two level process in which a pure negotiation loop and a conflict resolution strategy were run in parallel the pure negotiation model proposes a solution for a specific conflict then compares and analyzes other solutions according to their own preferences refreshes the solution space and the corresponding preference table the conflict resolution strategy determines the conflict and plans a solution for the conflict the negotiation communication model defines the behavior of the negotiation subject in the negotiation process it can be abstracted using concepts such as policies and preferences and use the cost comparison function to calculate the final negotiation result in order to verify the effectiveness of the negotiation protocol strategy for collision avoidance of group unmanned boats this section designs a case of group unmanned boat application negotiation protocol to resolve conflict resolution referring to the navigation state in fig 10 b there are four usvs including u s v 0 u s v 1 u s v 2 and u s v 3 after that u s v 0 initiates a negotiation request to the surrounding usvs and construct a star topology network according to the colregs u s v 0 should turn to starboard to avoid collision with u s v 1 whereas it should turn to port to avoid u s v 1 based on the grouping strategy thus u s v 0 sends a negotiation decision format frame to the starboard u s v 2 after received the negotiation frame u s v 2 calculates and returns the negotiation result on the basis of above negotiation protocol if u s v 0 receives the u s v 2 negotiation agreement format frame it sends a decision result to u s v 1 if u s v 1 matches the cost matrix and then agrees to the decision result it sends a negotiation agreement format frame to u s v 0 if the negotiation rejection format frame is received u s v 0 decelerates the navigation u s v 2 is based on the grouping algorithm calculates the steering angle because the u s v 3 is not affected by the decision during the negotiation process the actual collision avoidance process is not affected by u s v 0 so it does not participate in the negotiation with u s v 0 finally u s v 0 releases the resources of negotiation network so far a negotiation has been completed the sequence diagram fig 11 is shown the negotiation process for the above situation it can be seen from the above cases that although the negotiated network constructed is a one to many relationship the negotiation process is carried out in a step by step manner with the negotiation initiator as the negotiation center start with usv which depart from the rules and end with usv which affected by the target action then the usvs form a linear negotiation relationship through the negotiation center this design ensures that the usv in the negotiation network can negotiate according to certain logic and finally ensure usvs safety make the final goal of usvs consistent complete the coordinated collision avoidance of the swarm of usvs remark 2 to solve the problem of usv collision avoidance coordination this paper uses the negotiation method to judge the risk of collision and uses c o s t to combine the usv dangerous state and the negotiation protocol r i j is used to mark the dangerous state of each division of the current usv meanwhile a negotiation protocol is designed to update the dangerous state so that the usv can sense the change of the dangerous state and realize the collision avoidance coordination of the usvs 4 numerical simulation to verify the effectiveness of our approach via negotiation protocol for usvs simulations under generous scenarios for a swarm of usvs are carried out in x 0 o 0 y 0 system suppose the parameters of the usvs are l 5 m w 2 m k 0 2 t 0 5 k p 0 8 k i 5 and k d 10 following that d m can be 10 m fig 12 a presents the heading angles c and rudder angles δ variations of a usv when it turns from c 0 to c 30 without wind and current and its shows that when time is around 15 s c and δ are converged toward 30 and 0 respectively referring to the usv we set its v 0 16 kn c 0 0 and p x i p y i 0 0 if the turning angles of the usv can be 5 10 30 60 respectively and then corresponding targeted trajectories are demonstrated in fig 12 b and the steering distance a d maintains around 0 2 nm 4 1 collision avoidance simulation for a swarm of usvs 4 1 1 comparison with the schema in tam and bucknall 2013 under complex scenarios with 5 usvs in tam and bucknall 2013 a deterministic path planning algorithm was presented to computes a practical and colregs compliant navigation path for vessels collision avoidance and simulations for various traffic scenarios were designed to evaluate different aspects of the proposed algorithm to validate the effectiveness of our approach simulation case in tam and bucknall 2013 with 5 usvs is selected for comparison where in collision avoidance among the usvs and maneuverability of the usvs should be concerned consequently it is meaningful that the chosen scenarios are ideal for comparison and details can be referred to tam and bucknall 2013 table 4 shows the scenarios of the usvs fig 13 presents variation of p x i p y i c δ v and d i j of 5 usvs during the collision avoidance process fig 13 shows that in the selected case there are 4 classical encounter situations belong to colregs rules including head on overtaking crossing from port and starboard each usv would experience several types of encounter situations during collision avoidance process for instance u s v 1 would be encountered with the situation of head on with u s v 3 overtaking u s v 2 port crossing with u s v 4 and starboard crossing with u s v 5 the distance between usvs decreases from 1s to 55s as shown in fig 13 a in 55s the coordinates of u s v 1 u s v 2 u s v 3 u s v 4 and u s v 5 are 0 192 0 110 0 200 0 090 0 260 0 085 0 210 0 140 0 196 0 160 respectively although the final trajectories of usvs are crossed there exists no collision it can be found that in fig 13 b the distance between usvs gradually increases after 55s it is obvious that there is no collision between usvs in the whole collision avoidance progress comparison of our simulation results and those from tam and bucknall 2013 indicates our collision avoidance operation will be more natural as for figs 13 a and 5 usvs were originally under complex encounter situations but their overall situations change by applying our collision avoidance algorithm after a period 40s u s v 1 and u s v 2 were in the same group and they finally turned to port departure from rules for collision avoidance due to there being collision risk of u s v 5 at their starboard sides u s v 3 and u s v 4 turned to starboard for slight avoidance operation thus their situations may be simplified quickly as opposed to those simulation results tam and bucknall 2013 encounter situations between usvs were taken into account here together with their speeds whose duration curves shown in fig 13 e indicate that their speeds converge eventually due to the effect of our grouping strategy moreover their heading also tended closely the overall collision avoidance decision will be adjusted as situations changes simulation results show that safe avoidance and voyage achieved for 5 usvs after 125s and our avoidance operation effects will be more natural and fluent with reference to the planning path from tam and bucknall 2013 swarm of usvs dynamically adjusted their headings and speeds during the collision avoidance process avoidance decisions will change or be adjusted in view of changing situations to cope with the complex collision avoidance environment 4 1 2 negotiation aided avoidance simulation avoidance may usually be performed only in accordance with avoidance rules however negotiations with the surrounding usvs can be taken in some special cases to reduce unnecessary avoidance operations so that the avoidance effect can be better and the initial usv state shown in table 5 the collision avoidance trajectories and encounter situations fig 14 indicate the initial u s v 0 under the port and starboard crossing situations will substantially turn to starboard for avoidance but u s v 0 turned to port depart from colregs for avoidance after performance of communication negotiations with other usvs while u s v 0 and u s v 1 were under the port crossing situation u s v 0 also turned to port in a great range for avoidance then all the usvs can prevent collision successful such case fully reflects the negotiation protocol acts in concert during a changing situation process to lower those unnecessary avoidance operations and rapidly simplify the encounter situations thus avoidance and safe voyage of usvs can be guaranteed ref zhao et al 2016 presented an optimal reciprocal collision avoidance algorithm to real time collision avoidance with the compliance to the colregs for multiple usvs in which all the obstacles in the collision avoidance scenes have their independent autonomy the approach conforms to a practical marine situation for fully reflecting effects of the negotiation protocol during avoidance processes avoidance simulation results of 4 usvs from zhao et al 2016 for comparison motion situations were initialized to be similar with those from zhao et al 2016 for simulation of usvs the usvs initial state shown in table 6 comparison of simulation results of such case and those from zhao et al 2016 indicates that the improved obstacle avoidance algorithm was applied in zhao et al 2016 on the other hand the additional negotiation protocol was utilized here to simplify encounter situations during the avoidance processes in view of simulation results which shown in fig 15 u s v 1 will form the crossing encounter situation with u s v 4 then it will form the head on encounter situation with u s v 2 the collision avoidance algorithm can be utilized for analysis of the entire situations during the avoidance processes and those usvs whose motion situations are similar are incorporated in a group in fig 15 each usv has its independent autonomy u s v 1 takes a left turn to avoid u s v 4 than it avoiding the head on encounter with u s v 2 which illustrates that the collision avoidance approach via negotiation protocol can reduce collision risk to some extent the 4 usvs were originally under encounter and port and starboard crossing situations the negotiation protocol was applied to u s v 1 to turn to port depart from rules for avoidance of u s v 2 and u s v 3 and u s v 2 and u s v 4 turned to gradually be in the same group during the avoidance process because avoidance situations were changing though simulation results deviated greatly from the planning target point avoidance and negotiation by turning in a relatively large range and being depart from rules behave excellently here simulation results suggest that negotiations with those affected usvs can be performed to do compatible operation and eventually achieve avoidance while departure from rules is required 4 2 analysis of simulation results it can be found that by completing our approach excellent collision avoidance decisions are generated and a swarm of usvs can fulfill conflict free navigation ideally as for cases 2 and 3 section 4 1 2 where the negotiation protocol was applied navigation may come true for usv depart from the rules so that their avoidance operation can be slightly small and safer the coordinated operation can be perfectly implemented in case of necessary departure from rules as for application of the agreement protocol simulation results indicate that the negotiation protocol method may achieve safe avoidance in case of any large traffic flow 5 conclusions this paper stresses the collision avoidance problems for a swarm usvs by employing a collision avoidance approach based on a negotiation protocol a collision avoidance ad hoc network and corresponding protocol stack are proposed for the negotiation communication between usvs to strengthen the ability of the approach under complex collision avoidance conditions we put forward a negotiation protocol for usvs simulations under generous scenarios verify the effectiveness of our approach for solving the collision avoidance problems for a swarm of usvs in the near future with the aid of our collision avoidance approach for a swarm of usvs the collision avoidance platform for a swarm of usvs with environment disturbance can be built up and utilized

a quantification of rules 1 the same group safe speed among a swarm of usvs while usvs sail close to a dangerous distance density of the same group usv can be ρ a d where a and d are the coverage area and the average spacing of the same group usvs respectively while ρ l 2 d m the usv will slow down to flow its front usv thus d c won t come true against its front usv in its given forward direction 2 collision avoidance operation the collision avoidance operation is adjusted in accordance with the current density speed and position relative to the surrounding usvs for any usv to guarantee d m and collision avoidance operation will be confined to a range as small as possible 3 while any two usvs sail close to s an encounter situation may possibly occur head on while the motion target is within the range of 10 to the heading and the included angle of their heading is within the range of 6 it is regarded as the head on situation while it departures from the rules to be more appropriate for the current situation collision avoidance will occur departure rules port crossing the motion target is relatively within the range 247 5 350 and the motion target s heading is crossing with its heading the collision risk will be judged on the basis of the motion tendency if there exists any risk it turns to starboard by a proper angle for collision avoidance otherwise it will be appropriately departure from rules and measures will be taken for collision avoidance starboard crossing while the relative azimuth angle is within the range 10 112 5 and the motion target s heading is crossing with its heading motion trends of surrounding usvs are calculated while it turns to starboard to achieve collision avoidance it turns in accordance with the calculated steering angle otherwise it departures from rules to take collision avoidance operation in favor of the current situation overtaking in general overtaking will not be allowed during collision avoidance process while the current situation requires overtaking must be taken the actively overtaking usv will communicate with overtaking usvs using negotiation protocol 
20977,damping plates are generally used to reduce the response of floating platform by increasing the added mass and damping heave and pitch responses of spar platform with single and double damping plates under regular waves are discussed in this paper regular wave experiments are conducted on 1 50 scale spar hull with damping plate heave and pitch response amplitude operators raos are obtained numerically using boundary element method bem based software ansys aqwa and compared with the model test results parameters of scaling ratio damping plate diameter to spar diameter ratio damping plate position to spar draft ratio and spacing between the double damping plates to spar draft ratio are considered for the numerical analysis it is found that the heave and pitch raos reduce with an increase in scaling ratio diameter ratios of 1 2 1 4 position to spar draft ratio of 0 16 and spacing to spar draft ratio of 0 16 are suggested for reducing the heave response similarly diameter

gm metacentric height rao response amplitude operator kc keulegan carpenter number nrel national renewable energy laboratory 1 introduction energy consumption keeps on increasing nowadays due to more population hence power generation from renewable energy sources such as wind solar and waves are also increasing power is generated from wind using wind turbines and wind power generation from offshore area is increased nowadays due to the availability of steadier wind compared to the land bottom mounted structures are not appropriate for deep water hence floating platforms are required to support the wind turbine in deep water spar is considered as the supporting platform for floating wind turbine in this paper spar consists of single large vertical cylindrical hull and moored by the catenary or taut mooring lines it is ballast stabilized structure and hence its center of gravity lies below the center of buoyancy responses of spar platform should be less for the stability of floating offshore wind turbine spar draft is more than the semisubmersible and tension leg platform which helps to reduce the heave response generally heave and pitch natural periods of spar are far away from the low period waves but it might not be expected for long period waves also hence resonance condition i e incident wave period coincides with the spar natural period might be occurred for long period waves and the responses of spar might be more it can be avoided by increasing the spar natural period and damping therefore damping plates are generally attached with the spar hull to reduce the response during the resonance condition by increasing the added mass i e heave natural period will increase by increasing the heave added mass and damping fig 1 shows the spar hull with and without damping plate 2 literature review tao et al 2000 investigated the viscous damping effect of tension leg platform and spar using finite difference method it was found that the relation between

diameter ratio of disk significantly affects the vortex shedding modes and viscous damping downie et al 2000 carried out the experimental studies on 1 100 scale truss spar in regular and irregular waves it was found that the larger and solid plates exhibit less heave response compared to the plates with smaller dimension and perforation subsequently tao and dray 2008 carried out the experiments on porous and solid plates it was observed that the porous plates have more damping at small kc number and solid plates show more damping at large kc number chua et al 2005 conducted the model tests on 1 80 scale truss spar with solid and perforated square plates it was reported that the drag and inertia coefficients are more sensitive with the kc number for smaller values of kc zhang et al 2006 conducted the 1 100 scale model tests on cell spar to study the heave plate effects perforated and solid hexagonal heave plates were considered for the studies it was found that the heave response is reduced by providing the more number of heave plates it was also reported that the perforated plates with proper hole size have better heave performance compared to the solid plates in some cases effects of relative spacing i e ratio of spacing between the double heave plates and heave plate diameter on added mass and damping coefficients for cylinder with double heave plates were studied using finite difference method tao et al 2007 it was observed that the relative spacing strongly affects the vortex shedding modes gilloteaux and bozonnet 2014 carried out the parametric studies on cylindrical shape hull with multi megawatt wind turbine it was found that the response is less for cylinder with double heave plates model test and numerical investigations were carried out on deepwater octagonal fdpso i e floating drilling production storage and offloading vessel with heave plates yu et al 2017 it was concluded that the performance of octagonal fdpso with single heave plate is better than the two heave plates damping effects on mathieu instability of deep draft multi spar with heave plates were investigated numerically li et al 2011 free decay regular and random wave tests were conducted it was reported that the damping due to heave plates has significant role in reducing the pitch instability the results showed that the deep draft multi spar has better heave performance under real sea condition compared to the classic spar an and faltinsen 2012 studied the effects of horizontally submerged two dimensional thin perforated and solid plates on forced oscillations of heave and roll semi analytical method was used for the analysis of two dimensional perforated and solid plates at finite and infinite water depths it was observed that the wave load on perforated plate is smaller than the solid plates it was also reported that the perforated plates have smaller wave reflection than the solid plates subsequently experimental and numerical studies were conducted on horizontally submerged perforated rectangular heave plates an and faltinsen 2013 the results showed that the damping is mainly due to the flow through the perforation of heave plate at small kc number however damping is mainly due to the flow separation of outer edges of heave plate at large kc number rajagopalan and nihous 2016 investigated the drag and added mass coefficients on submerged heave plates using numerical simulation effects of frequency parameter and kc number on force coefficients were studied wen jun et al 2012 carried out the numerical studies on truss spar

vortex shedding is affected by the in plane current it was also reported that the damping coefficient increases with the increase in kc number garrido mendoza et al 2015 studied the influence of heave plate oscillating near the seabed on added mass and damping coefficients it was reported that the added mass and damping coefficients increase when the heave plate oscillates nearer to the seabed

heave and pitch responses of spar platform with damping plate is performed in ansys aqwa software ansys aqwa is based on the potential flow theory i e diffraction theory and boundary element method i e panel method is used for solving the hydrodynamic radiation diffraction problems hence it considers the radiation damping only and viscous damping should be added as an additional damping to find the correct responses viscous damping is calculated by subtracting the radiation damping from the total damping damping can be obtained from the experimental free decay test or numerically using cfd

different panel sizes from frequency domain analysis difference of heave and pitch raos for panel sizes of 0 03 m 0 04 m and 0 05 m are insignificant hence panel size of 0 04 m is chosen for the

on the finite volume method subbulakshmi and sundaravadivelu 2016 and viscous damping is added as an additional damping in ansys aqwa details of spar hull with a single damping plate at the spar keel for supporting the nrel 5 mw horizontal axis wind turbine are listed in table 3 a numerical model of spar hull with a single damping plate at the spar keel and catenary mooring lines are shown in fig 9 5 1 effects of diameter ratio dp ds single damping plate is placed at the spar keel to investigate the effects of diameter ratio on heave and pitch responses of spar damping plate diameter is increased from 1 2 to 2 times the spar diameter with an interval of 0 2 spar hull without damping plate is considered as having the diameter ratio of 1 models are developed for the different damping plate diameters and numerical models of spar hull with a single damping plate at the spar keel for various diameter ratios are shown in fig 10 added mass of heave and pitch for various diameter ratios in full scale system i e scaling ratio lf lm 1 are represented in fig 11 a and b heave added mass is formed in the shape of hemisphere for spar without damping plate and approximately a sphere i e ellipse for spar with damping plate subbulakshmi and sundaravadivelu 2016 heave added mass increases with the increase in damping plate diameter and hence heave natural period also increases with the damping plate diameter heave added mass increments are 49 5 154 9 277 8 463 9 and 698 7 respectively for diameter ratios of 1 2 2 compared to the spar hull without damping plate i e diameter ratio of 1 increase in heave added mass is due to the damping plate projection beyond the bottom edge of spar tao and cai 2004 similarly pitch added mass increases by 0 9 2 4 4 5 6 7 and 9 5 for diameter ratios of 1 2 2 compared to the diameter ratio of 1 heave added mass increases predominantly with the increase in damping plate diameter compared to the pitch added mass response amplitude operators rao of heave and pitch for full scale system and 1 50 scale model are represented in fig 12 a and b and fig 13 a and b peak heave and pitch raos for various diameter ratios and scaling ratios are plotted in fig 14 a and b heave rao reduces with the increase in damping plate diameter due to the increase in damping and added mass tao and cai 2004 peak heave rao reductions are 29 9 56 5 57 4 59 4 and 64 2 for diameter ratios of 1 2 2 with respect to the diameter ratio of 1 in full scale system peak heave rao reduces by 30 3 48 50 5 50 6 and 58 5 for dp ds ratios of 1 2 1 4 1 6 1 8 and 2 compared to the spar hull without damping plate in 1 50 scale model pitch rao decreases with the increase in diameter ratios from 1 to 1 4 after that it increases since pitch damping increases with the diameter ratios from 1 to 1 4 peak pitch rao reduces by 14 35 2 30 4 28 2 and 25 7 respectively for dp ds ratios of 1 2 2 with respect to the dp ds ratio of 1 in full scale system and peak pitch rao reductions are 12 2 30 1 25 3 23 7 and 21 2 in 1 50 scale model heave and pitch raos of 1 50 scale model are lesser than the full scale system since heave and pitch damping of 1 50 scale model are more compared to the full scale system subbulakshmi and sundaravadivelu 2016 hence heave and pitch rao reduces with an increase in scaling ratios from 1 to 50 it is found that the diameter ratios of 1 2 1 4 offer a more significant effect on reduction of heave and pitch raos hence diameter ratios of 1 2 1 4 are suggested for reducing the heave and pitch responses 5 2 effects of position to spar draft ratio d t single damping plate is located above the spar keel to investigate the position to spar draft ratio effects on heave and pitch responses of spar position to spar draft ratios of 0 2 0 8 with an interval of 0 2 are considered for the parametric analysis in addition to the ratios of 0 2 0 8 d t ratios of 0 04 0 16 with an interval of 0 04 are considered to study the damping plate position nearer to the spar keel fig 15 represents the numerical models of spar hull with a single damping plate above the spar keel for various position to spar draft ratios heave and pitch added mass for various position to spar draft ratios in full scale system are represented in fig 16 a and b heave and pitch added mass reduce with the increase in position to spar draft ratio heave added mass is less for damping plate placed above the spar keel compared to the damping plate placed at the spar keel heave added mass is reduced from 4 1 to 7 8 for position to spar draft ratios of 0 08 0 8 compared to the d t ratio of 0 04 and the reduction in pitch added mass varies from 0 3 to 4 heave and pitch raos of full scale system and 1 50 scale model are plotted in fig 17 a and b and fig 18 a and b peak raos of heave and pitch for different scaling ratios and position to spar draft ratios are represented in fig 19 a and b heave rao reduces with the increase in position to spar draft ratios of 0 04 0 16 since heave damping increases for these ranges of d t ratios and then it starts to increase since heave damping is less when the damping plate is placed at larger distance above the spar keel peak heave rao reduces by 4 9 12 9 21 5 11 5 13 8 9 9 respectively for ratios of 0 08 0 6 with respect to the d t ratio of 0 04 in full scale system and 5 4 9 8 12 8 5 4 9 4 1 9 in 1 50 scale model pitch rao reduces with an increase in position to spar draft ratio up to 0 12 beyond that it increases reduction in peak pitch rao is 3 2 13 2 for ratios of 0 08 0 12 in full scale system and 0 7 5 7 in 1 50 scale model compared to the ratio of 0 04 peak heave and pitch raos for spar hull with a single damping plate placed at the spar keel are 6 22 7 12 in full scale system and 5 92 7 02 in 1 50 scale model position to spar draft ratio of 0 16 shows less heave rao and the ratio of 0 12 exhibits less pitch rao compared to the responses of spar hull with a single damping plate placed at the spar keel hence position to spar draft ratio of 0 16 is suggested for heave response reduction and d t ratio of 0 12 is found to be better for reducing the pitch response 5 3 effects of spacing to spar draft ratio l t spacing between the double damping plates is varied from 0 2 to 0 8 times the spar draft with an interval of 0 2 and also 0 04 to 0 16 with an interval of 0 04 fig 20 shows the numerical models of spar hull with double damping plates for various spacing to spar draft ratios heave and pitch added mass for various spacing to spar draft ratios in full scale system are represented in fig 21 a and b heave added mass increases with the increase in l t ratios from 0 04 to 0 08 after that it decreases when the spacing between the double damping plates is very small i e l t ratio of 0 04 heave added mass is less due to the interference between the added mass of double damping plates pitch added mass reduces with an increase in spacing to spar draft ratios and reductions vary from 0 3 to 3 9 for ratios of 0 08 0 8 compared to the ratio of 0 04 heave and pitch raos for full scale system and 1 50 scale model are plotted in fig 22 a and b and fig 23 a and b peak raos of heave and pitch for various spacing to spar draft ratios and scaling ratios are represented in fig 24 a and b heave rao reduces with the increase in spacing to spar draft ratios from 0 04 to 0 16 heave rao reduces with the increase in l t ratios from 0 2 to 0 4 after that it increases and then again it reduces at 0 8 ratio when the spacing between the double damping plates is too large i e l t 0 6 then heave damping is less and hence heave rao is more at the ratio of 0 6 however at the ratio of 0 8 heave damping is more due to the water surface effect and hence heave rao is less peak heave rao reduces by 22 3 32 2 33 6 23 7 29 6 23 5 35 respectively for ratios of 0 08 0 8 with respect to the l t ratio of 0 04 in full scale system and 27 33 8 35 6 29 7 35 22 4 38 6 in 1 50 scale model pitch rao reduces with the increase in spacing to spar draft ratios up to 0 2 peak pitch rao reductions are 3 8 7 4 10 7 14 for ratios of 0 08 0 2 with respect to 0 04 l t ratio in full scale system and 1 7 3 4 6 9 11 1 in 1 50 scale model spacing to spar draft ratios of 0 08 0 8 exhibit less heave rao compared to the heave rao of spar hull with a single damping plate positioned at the spar keel double damping plates are placed too closely for l t ratio of 0 04 and hence added mass and damping are low for this case and heave rao is more respectively tao et al 2007 spacing to spar draft ratios of 0 08 0 2 show less pitch rao compared to the pitch rao of spar hull with a single damping plate placed at the spar keel spacing to spar draft ratio of 0 16 is suggested for reducing the heave response and the ratio of 0 2 is recommended for pitch response reduction 5 4 effects of scaling ratio lf lm from the parametric studies conducted on various parameters it is noted that the heave and pitch raos reduce with an increase in scaling ratios from 1 to 50 i e from full scale system to scaled model since heave and pitch damping increase with an increase in scaling ratio heave and pitch raos of spar hull with a single damping plate placed at the spar keel with diameter ratio of 1 3 are 6 22 7 12 in full scale system and 5 92 7 02 in 1 50 scale model heave and pitch raos reductions are 4 8 and 1 4 for 1 50 scale model compared to the full scale system similarly heave and pitch raos of spar hull with double damping plates with spacing to spar draft ratio of 0 08 are 6 07 6 97 in full scale system and 5 41 6 7 in 1 50 scale model reduction in heave and pitch raos are 10 9 and 3 9 for 1 50 scale model compared to the full scale system 6 conclusions heave and pitch raos are obtained numerically using ansys aqwa frequency domain analysis by inputting the additional viscous damping and validated with the 1 50 scale model test results of spar hull with a single damping plate placed at the spar keel effects of damping plate position on heave and pitch responses of spar platform with single and double damping plates under regular waves are investigated numerically for various parameters such as scaling ratio damping plate diameter damping plate position above the spar keel and spacing between the double damping plates heave and pitch responses of spar platform with single and double damping plates at various positions are compared with the responses of spar hull with a single damping plate placed at the spar keel the following conclusions are drawn from this study heave and pitch raos are less for scaled model compared to the full scale system since heave and pitch damping increase while the scaling ratio increases from 1 to 50 i e from full scale system to scaled model heave added mass increases significantly compared to the pitch added mass while the diameter ratio increases from 1 2 to 2 diameter ratios of 1 2 1 4 have more significant effect on heave and pitch responses reduction when the damping plate is placed above the spar keel heave added mass is less compared to the damping plate placed at the spar keel position to spar draft ratio of 0 16 is suggested for heave response reduction since heave damping is less when the damping plate is placed at larger distance above the spar keel position to spar draft ratio of 0 12 shows less pitch rao compared to the rao of spar hull with a single damping plate placed at the spar keel heave added mass is less for spacing to spar draft ratio of 0 04 since double damping plates are placed too closer spacing to spar draft ratio of 0 16 is found to be better for reducing the heave response and the ratio of 0 2 is recommended for pitch response reduction l t ratios of 0 08 0 8 show less heave rao and the ratios of 0 08 0 2 exhibit less pitch rao compared to the raos of spar hull with a single damping plate placed at the spar keel future work will be conducted on the

20977,damping plates are generally used to reduce the response of floating platform by increasing the added mass and damping heave and pitch responses of spar platform with single and double damping plates under regular waves are discussed in this paper regular wave experiments are conducted on 1 50 scale spar hull with damping plate heave and pitch response amplitude operators raos are obtained numerically using boundary element method bem based software ansys aqwa and compared with the model test results parameters of scaling ratio damping plate diameter to spar diameter ratio damping plate position to spar draft ratio and spacing between the double damping plates to spar draft ratio are considered for the numerical analysis it is found that the heave and pitch raos reduce with an increase in scaling ratio diameter ratios of 1 2 1 4 position to spar draft ratio of 0 16 and spacing to spar draft ratio of 0 16 are suggested for reducing the heave response similarly diameter ratios of 1 2 1 4 position to spar draft ratio of 0 12 and spacing to spar draft ratio of 0 2 are recommended for pitch response reduction keywords spar damping plate regular wave scaling ratio heave

population hence power generation from renewable energy sources such as wind solar and waves are also increasing power is generated from wind using wind turbines and wind power generation from offshore area is increased nowadays due to the availability of steadier wind compared to the land bottom mounted structures are not appropriate for deep water hence floating platforms are required to support the wind turbine in deep water spar is considered as the supporting platform for floating wind turbine in this paper spar consists of single large vertical cylindrical hull and moored by the catenary or taut mooring lines it is ballast stabilized structure and hence its center of gravity lies below the center of buoyancy responses of spar platform should be less for the stability of floating offshore wind turbine spar draft is more than the semisubmersible and tension leg platform which helps to reduce the heave response generally heave and pitch natural periods of spar are far away from the low period waves but it might not be expected for long period waves also hence resonance condition i e incident wave period coincides with the spar natural period might be occurred for long period waves and the responses of spar might be more it can be avoided by increasing the spar natural period and damping therefore damping plates are generally attached with the spar hull to reduce the response during the resonance condition by increasing the added mass i e heave natural period will increase by increasing the heave added mass and damping fig 1 shows the spar hull with and without damping plate 2 literature review tao et al 2000 investigated the viscous damping effect of tension leg platform and spar using finite difference method it was found that the relation between

ratio between the disk diameter and spar diameter and aspect ratio effects on vortex shedding added mass and damping coefficients based on the finite difference method it was reported that the diameter ratio of disk significantly affects the vortex shedding modes and viscous damping downie et al 2000 carried out the experimental studies on 1 100 scale truss spar in regular and irregular waves it was found that the larger and solid plates exhibit less heave response compared to the plates with smaller dimension and perforation subsequently tao and dray 2008 carried out the experiments on porous and solid plates it was observed that the porous plates have more damping at small kc number and solid plates show more damping at large kc number chua et al 2005 conducted the model tests on 1 80 scale truss spar with solid and perforated square plates it was reported that the drag and inertia coefficients are more sensitive with the kc number for smaller values of kc zhang et al 2006 conducted the 1 100 scale model tests on cell spar to study the heave plate effects perforated and solid hexagonal heave plates were considered for the studies it was found that the heave response is reduced by providing the more number of heave plates it was also reported that the perforated plates with proper hole size have better heave performance compared to the solid plates in some cases effects of relative spacing i e ratio of spacing between the double heave plates and heave plate diameter on added mass and damping coefficients for cylinder with double heave plates were studied using finite difference method tao et al 2007 it was observed that the relative spacing strongly affects the vortex shedding modes gilloteaux and bozonnet 2014 carried out the parametric studies on cylindrical shape hull with multi megawatt wind turbine it was found that the response is less for cylinder with double heave plates model test and numerical investigations were carried out on deepwater octagonal fdpso i e floating drilling production storage and offloading vessel with heave plates yu et al 2017 it was concluded that the performance of octagonal fdpso with single heave plate is better than the two heave plates damping effects on mathieu instability of deep draft multi spar with heave plates were investigated numerically li et al 2011 free decay regular and random wave tests were conducted it was reported that the damping due to heave plates has significant role in reducing the pitch instability the results showed that the deep draft multi spar has better heave performance under real sea condition compared to the classic spar an and faltinsen 2012 studied the effects of horizontally submerged two dimensional thin perforated and solid plates on forced oscillations of heave and roll semi analytical method was used for the analysis of two dimensional perforated and solid plates at finite and infinite water depths it was observed that the wave load on perforated plate is smaller than the solid plates it was also reported that the perforated plates have smaller wave reflection than the solid plates subsequently experimental and numerical studies were conducted on horizontally submerged perforated rectangular heave plates an and faltinsen 2013 the results showed that the damping is mainly due to the flow through the perforation of heave plate at small kc number however damping is mainly due to the flow separation of outer edges of heave plate at large kc number rajagopalan and nihous 2016 investigated the drag and added mass coefficients on submerged heave plates using numerical simulation effects of frequency parameter and kc number on force coefficients were studied wen jun et al 2012 carried out the numerical studies on truss spar

the forced oscillation tests on spar with heave plate it was observed that the added mass coefficient increases with the increase in kc number it was also found that the added mass is more for two plates with rectangular edge than the triangular and semicircular edges heave plate effects under steady in plane current using cfd simulation were investigated yang et al 2014 it was found that the vortex shedding is affected by the in plane current it was also reported that the damping coefficient increases with the increase in kc number garrido mendoza et al 2015 studied the influence of heave plate oscillating near the seabed on added mass and damping coefficients it was reported that the added mass and damping coefficients increase when the heave plate oscillates nearer to the seabed experimental and numerical studies were carried out on spar hull with single and double heave plates to find the influence of heave plates on heave damping subbulakshmi and sundaravadivelu 2016 koh and cho 2016 conducted the experimental and analytical investigations on cylinder with heave plates it was observed that the heave response is less for cylinder with dual heave plates added mass variation of heave plate separated from the cylinder bottom was investigated zhu and lim 2017 it was found that the influence of heave plate diameter is more on added mass compared to the kc number and heave plate gap zhang and ishihara 2018 studied the influence of diameter ratio spacing ratio and aspect ratio on hydrodynamic coefficients of multiple octagonal heave plates using 1 100 scale model it was observed that the added mass increases with the increase in diameter ratio and spacing ratio from the existing literatures it was observed that many experimental investigations were conducted using smaller size models i e larger scaling ratio in the present paper 1 50 scale model is used to carry out the model tests and scaling effects i e full scale system and scaled model are also studied numerically damping plates are generally used as an additional damping device to reduce the heave response in resonance condition in addition to the heave response damping plate effects on pitch response are also studied in the present paper hence effects of damping plate position on heave and pitch responses of spar platform with single and double damping plates to support the floating wind turbine are investigated in this paper investigations on parameters such as scaling ratio damping plate position to spar draft ratio and spacing between the double damping plates to spar

heave and pitch responses of spar platform with damping plate is performed in ansys aqwa software ansys aqwa is based on the potential flow theory i e diffraction theory and boundary element method i e panel method is used for solving the hydrodynamic radiation diffraction problems hence it considers the radiation damping only and viscous damping should be added as an additional damping to find the correct responses viscous damping is calculated by subtracting the radiation damping from the total damping damping can be obtained from the experimental free decay test or numerically using cfd simulation 1 50 scale spar hull with a single damping plate at the spar keel is modelled in ansys aqwa for comparing the numerical results with the model test results fairlead and anchor points are

different panel sizes from frequency domain analysis difference of heave and pitch raos for panel sizes of 0 03 m 0 04 m and 0 05 m are insignificant hence panel size of 0 04 m is chosen for the analysis since 0 03 m panel size consumes more time for analysis meshing of spar hull with a single damping plate at the spar keel is shown in fig 7 b peak heave raos for different panel sizes are

for the numerical parametric analysis and which are listed in table 2 diameter ratio of 1 3 is considered to study the influence of various parameters on heave and pitch responses of spar four catenary mooring lines with an angle of 45 to the wave direction are considered for the parametric studies heave and pitch damping for various parameters were calculated using star ccm software based on the finite volume method subbulakshmi and sundaravadivelu 2016 and viscous damping is added as an additional damping in ansys aqwa details of spar hull with a single damping plate at the spar keel for supporting the nrel 5 mw horizontal axis wind turbine are listed in table 3 a numerical model of spar hull with a single damping plate at the spar keel and catenary mooring lines are shown in fig

increased from 1 2 to 2 times the spar diameter with an interval of 0 2 spar hull without damping plate is considered as having the diameter ratio of 1 models are developed for the different damping plate diameters and numerical models of spar hull with a single damping plate at the spar keel for various diameter ratios are shown in fig 10 added mass of heave and pitch for various diameter ratios in full scale system i e scaling ratio lf lm 1 are represented in fig 11 a and b heave added mass is formed in the shape of hemisphere for spar without damping plate and approximately a sphere i e ellipse for spar with damping plate subbulakshmi and sundaravadivelu 2016 heave added mass increases with the increase in damping plate diameter and hence heave natural period also increases with the damping plate diameter heave added mass increments are 49 5 154 9 277 8 463 9 and 698 7 respectively for diameter ratios of 1 2 2 compared to the spar hull without damping plate i e diameter ratio of 1 increase in heave added mass is due to the damping plate projection beyond the bottom edge of spar tao and cai 2004 similarly pitch added mass increases by 0 9 2 4 4 5 6 7 and 9 5 for diameter ratios of 1 2 2 compared to the diameter ratio of 1 heave added mass increases predominantly with the increase in damping plate diameter compared to the pitch added mass response amplitude operators rao of heave and pitch for full scale system and 1 50 scale model are represented in fig 12 a and b and fig 13 a and b peak heave and pitch raos for various diameter ratios and scaling ratios are plotted in fig 14 a and b heave rao reduces with the increase in damping plate diameter due to the increase in damping and added mass tao and cai 2004 peak heave rao reductions are 29 9 56 5 57 4 59 4 and 64 2 for diameter ratios of 1 2 2 with respect to the diameter ratio of 1 in full scale system peak heave rao reduces by 30 3 48 50 5 50 6 and 58 5 for dp ds ratios of 1 2 1 4 1 6 1 8 and 2 compared to the spar hull without damping plate in 1 50 scale model pitch rao decreases with the increase in diameter ratios from 1 to 1 4 after that it increases since pitch damping increases with the diameter ratios from 1 to 1 4 peak pitch rao reduces by 14 35 2 30 4 28 2 and 25 7 respectively for dp ds ratios of 1 2 2 with respect to the dp ds ratio of 1 in full scale system and peak pitch rao reductions are 12 2 30 1 25 3 23 7 and 21 2 in 1 50 scale model heave and pitch raos of 1 50 scale model are lesser than the full scale system since heave and pitch damping of 1 50 scale model are more compared to the full scale system subbulakshmi and sundaravadivelu 2016 hence heave and pitch rao reduces with an increase in scaling ratios from 1 to 50 it is found that the diameter ratios of 1 2 1 4 offer a more significant effect on reduction of heave and pitch raos hence diameter ratios of 1 2 1 4 are suggested for reducing the heave and pitch responses 5 2 effects of position to spar

position nearer to the spar keel fig 15 represents the numerical models of spar hull with a single damping plate above the spar keel for various position to spar draft ratios heave and pitch added mass for various position to spar draft ratios in full scale system are represented in fig 16 a and b heave and pitch added mass reduce with the increase in position to spar draft ratio heave added mass is less for damping plate placed above the spar keel compared to the damping plate placed at the spar keel heave added mass is reduced from 4 1 to 7 8 for position to spar draft ratios of 0 08 0 8 compared to the d t ratio of 0 04 and the reduction in pitch added mass varies from 0 3 to 4 heave and pitch raos of full scale system and 1 50 scale model are plotted in fig 17 a and b and fig 18 a and b peak raos of heave and pitch for different scaling ratios and position to spar draft ratios are represented in fig 19 a and b heave rao reduces with the increase in position to spar draft ratios of 0 04 0 16 since heave damping increases for these ranges of d t ratios and then it starts to increase since heave damping is less when the damping plate is placed at larger distance above the spar keel peak heave rao reduces by 4 9 12 9 21 5 11 5 13 8 9 9 respectively for ratios of 0 08 0 6 with respect to the d t ratio of 0 04 in full scale system and 5 4 9 8 12 8 5 4 9 4 1 9 in 1 50 scale model pitch rao reduces with an increase in position to spar draft ratio up to 0 12 beyond that it increases reduction in peak pitch rao is 3 2 13 2 for ratios of 0 08 0 12 in full scale system and 0 7 5 7 in 1 50 scale model compared to the ratio of 0 04 peak heave and pitch raos for spar hull with a single damping plate placed at the spar keel are 6 22 7 12 in full scale system and 5 92 7 02 in 1 50 scale model position to spar draft ratio of 0 16 shows less heave rao and the ratio of 0 12 exhibits less pitch rao compared to the responses of spar hull with a single damping plate placed at the spar keel hence position to spar draft ratio of 0 16 is suggested for heave response reduction and d t ratio of 0 12 is found to be better for reducing the pitch response 5 3 effects of spacing to spar draft ratio l t spacing between the double damping plates is varied from 0 2 to 0 8 times the spar draft with an interval of 0 2 and also 0 04 to 0 16 with an interval of 0 04 fig 20 shows the numerical models of spar hull with double damping plates for various spacing to spar draft ratios heave and pitch added mass for various spacing to spar draft ratios in full scale system are represented in fig 21 a and b heave added mass increases with the increase in l t ratios from 0 04 to 0 08 after that it decreases when the spacing between the double damping plates is very small i e l t ratio of 0 04 heave added mass is less due to the interference between the added mass of double damping plates pitch added mass reduces with an increase in spacing to spar draft ratios and reductions vary from 0 3 to 3 9 for ratios of 0 08 0 8 compared to the ratio of 0 04 heave and pitch raos for full scale system and 1 50 scale model are plotted in fig 22 a and b and fig 23 a and b peak raos of heave and pitch for various spacing to spar draft ratios and scaling ratios are represented in fig 24 a and b heave rao reduces with the increase in spacing to spar draft ratios from 0 04 to 0 16 heave rao reduces with the increase in l t ratios from 0 2 to 0 4 after that it increases and then again it reduces at 0 8 ratio when the spacing between the double damping plates is too large i e l t 0 6 then heave damping is less and hence heave rao is more at the ratio of 0 6 however at the ratio of 0 8 heave damping is more due to the water surface effect and hence heave rao is less peak heave rao reduces by 22 3 32 2 33 6 23 7 29 6 23 5 35 respectively for ratios of 0 08 0 8 with respect to the l t ratio of 0 04 in full scale system and 27 33 8 35 6 29 7 35 22 4 38 6 in 1 50 scale model pitch rao reduces with the increase in spacing to spar draft ratios up to 0 2 peak pitch rao reductions are 3 8 7 4 10 7 14 for ratios of 0 08 0 2 with respect to 0 04 l t ratio in full scale system and 1 7 3 4 6 9 11 1 in 1 50 scale model spacing to spar draft ratios of 0 08 0 8 exhibit less heave rao compared to the heave rao of spar hull with a single damping plate positioned at the spar keel double damping plates are placed too closely for l t ratio of 0 04 and hence added mass and damping are low for this case and heave rao is more respectively tao et al 2007 spacing to spar draft ratios of 0 08 0 2 show less pitch rao compared to the pitch rao of spar hull with a single damping plate placed at the spar keel spacing to spar draft ratio of 0 16 is suggested for reducing the heave response and the ratio of 0 2 is recommended for pitch response reduction 5 4 effects of scaling ratio lf lm from the parametric studies conducted on various parameters it is noted that the heave and pitch raos reduce with an increase in scaling ratios from 1 to 50 i e from full scale system to scaled model since heave and pitch damping increase with an increase in scaling ratio heave and pitch raos of spar hull with a single damping plate placed at the spar keel with diameter ratio of 1 3 are 6 22 7 12 in full scale system and 5 92 7 02 in 1 50 scale model heave and pitch raos reductions are 4 8 and 1 4 for 1 50 scale model compared to the full scale system similarly heave and pitch raos of spar hull with double damping plates with spacing to spar draft ratio of 0 08 are 6 07 6 97 in full scale system and 5 41 6 7 in 1 50 scale model reduction in heave and pitch raos are 10 9 and 3 9 for 1 50 scale model compared to the full scale system 6 conclusions heave and pitch raos are obtained numerically using ansys aqwa frequency domain analysis by inputting the additional viscous damping and validated with the 1 50 scale model test results of spar hull with a single damping plate placed at the spar keel effects of damping plate position on heave and pitch responses of spar platform with single and double damping plates under regular waves are investigated numerically for various parameters such as scaling ratio damping plate diameter damping plate position above the spar keel and spacing between the double damping plates heave and pitch responses of spar platform with single and double damping plates at various positions are compared with the responses of spar hull with a single damping plate placed at the spar keel the following conclusions are drawn from this study heave and pitch raos are less for scaled model compared to the full scale system since heave and pitch damping increase while the scaling ratio increases from 1 to 50 i e from full scale system to scaled model heave added mass increases significantly compared to the pitch added mass while the diameter ratio increases from 1 2 to 2 diameter ratios of 1 2 1 4 have more significant effect on heave and pitch responses reduction when the damping plate is placed above the spar keel heave added mass is less compared to the damping plate placed at the spar keel position to spar draft ratio of 0 16 is suggested for heave response reduction since heave damping is less when the damping plate is placed at larger distance above the spar keel position to spar draft ratio of 0 12 shows less pitch rao compared to the rao of spar hull with a single damping plate placed at the spar keel heave added mass is less for spacing to spar draft ratio of 0 04 since double damping plates are placed too closer spacing to spar draft ratio of 0 16 is found to be better for reducing the heave response and the ratio of 0 2 is recommended for pitch response reduction l t ratios of 0 08 0 8 show less heave rao and the ratios of 0 08 0 2 exhibit less pitch rao compared to the raos of spar hull with a single damping plate placed at the spar keel future work will be conducted on the

20978,the present work provides the turbulence characteristics of oscillating flow through passive grid under rigid boundary influence by adopting an experimental approach the oscillations in the steady unidirectional flow were generated by plunger type wave maker this study attempts to analyse the turbulent length scales and local reynolds numbers in order to characterise the different eddy sizes in the oscillating flow environment due to the interaction of grid and rigid boundary the normalized phase averaged shannon entropy is also presented to understand the degree of the randomness in oscillating flow environment through the passive grid further to understand the deviation from the isotropic turbulence the turbulence triangle eigen values and the invariant functions are presented at the downstream of the grid for the three oscillating flow cases keywords passive grid rigid boundary length scales turbulence triangle shannon entropy 1 introduction in general the screens and rods in form of mesh grids are generally placed in the test setup for breaking large scale turbulence structures but to produce turbulence grid may also be used in the experimental test setups for large reynolds number flows the latter usage and its flow characteristics at the near and far field region is what we are interested in and is explored here in grid generated turbulence substantial effort went into the accumulation of enormous quantity of reliable and accurate experimental data in order to confirm turbulence theories and models and was studied during the last few decades despite progresses in the measurement methods and instrumentations that led to acquire more accurate and reliable measurements satisfactory answers on the turbulence characteristics of oscillatory flow through grid and its interaction with bottom boundary is not available this is because in grid turbulence the flow characteristics depend on numerous aspects for e g the shape of the grid elements accuracy of the grid construction surface roughness of the grid rod elements and its solidity ratio corrsin 1963 uberoi and wallis 1967 further in oscillating grid the flow structure also depend on frequency and amplitude of oscillation of the grid hopfinger and toly 1976 in addition hancock and bradshaw 1983 introduced the concept of rigid boundaries and suggested that in grid turbulence rigid boundary introduce their own dissipative mechanics in the flow to examine the influence of the bottom boundary in the flow through grid hancock and bradshaw 1983 investigated the relative influence of length scale on the boundary layer the reduction of normal component of velocity fluctuation by solid wall is the probable reason for the increase in length scale and the decrease in free stream turbulence cheng and law 2001 studied the turbulence features due to oscillating grid in the direction perpendicular to the flow for a wide range of oscillating frequencies 1 4 hz hurst and vassilicos 2007 used fractal grids for their experiment and suggested that the fractal square grids endorse higher intensities of turbulence dean and dalrymple 1991 suggested that when the ratio of the flow depth h and wavelength l o is greater than 1 2 then the motion of wave induced water particles abates with flow depth and ultimately disappears at a depth comparable to half the wavelength in these conditions waves are not influenced by the boundary and these are known as deep water waves dww however when the ratio of flow depth and wavelength is less than 1 20 the water depth is not adequate to permit the entire wave motion development and waves are strongly influenced by the boundary as suggested by dean and dalrymple 1991 these waves are termed as shallow water waves sww for the criteria when the ratio of flow depth and wavelength lies between 1 20 to 1 2 waves are somewhat partially influenced by the boundary and these waves fall under the category of intermediate water waves iww in the present experimental cases ofc1 ofc2 and ofc3 the ratio of flow depth and observed wavelength i e h l o are 0 14 0 20 and 0 37 respectively the above ratio of h l o falls within the category of intermediate water waves iww in which waves are partly affected by bottom boundary one of the most important field based experiment works was explored in the surf and swash zone by petti and longo 2001 they suggested that the length scales are directly related to height of the wave and it increase towards the near boundary and decrease close to the surface in the swash zone long 1978 developed a theoretical model of study turbulence in homogeneous fluid induced by an oscillating grid longo 2011 studied experimentally the turbulence and the correlation with free surface and suggested that the process of stress transfer is controlled by the free surface chiapponi et al 2012 investigated experimentally the interaction between oscillating grid turbulence and free surface and used velocity and length scales to characterise the free surface dynamics it was further reported that the kinetic energy associated with the free surface fluctuations increases with the reynolds number at a rate dependent on frequency of grid oscillation longo et al 2013 performed analytical and experiment study of free surface fluctuation generated by grid stirred turbulence they suggested that if the forcing period has dual peaks a detonate of oscillator is predict mccorquodale and munro 2017 studied experimentally using piv and suggested the three main mechanisms governing the interaction of grid generated turbulence with the turbulence generated from solid boundary viscous effect return to isotropy and turbulent transport recently raushan et al 2019 experimentally investigated the effect of rigid boundary on grid generated turbulence and concluded that the near field flow region of the grid depends on the mesh size whereas at the far field region of the grid the flow characteristics are more or less independent of the mesh size the current work is different from the oscillating grid turbulence which was performed by longo et al 2013 in the present work the turbulent characteristics of the oscillating fluid flow through the passive grid under the consideration of bottom boundary is analysed rather than the vertically oscillating grid in water tank the present work focuses on the spatial evolution of turbulence structure of the oscillating fluid movement that passed through the passive grid for the three oscillating flow cases the changes due to the three different superimposing oscillating frequencies on steady unidirectional current at the downstream spatial positions of the grids are in contrast to the without grid case in the fully developed state the approach of time and phase averaging is applied on the three dimensional instantaneous time series recorded velocity data the presented result is useful in acquiring knowledge on the mean dissipation rate length scales degree of the order or disorder lumley triangle and the invariant function under oscillating flow conditions and boundary influence in the flow the results are presented at the different spatial locations downstream of grid 2 experimental setup and methodology the experimental study on grid generated turbulence for oscillating flows was carried out in a wave flume the channel is 18 m long 0 90 m wide and 0 90 m deep and equipped with a servo controlled wave maker to create oscillations in the flow at the inlet position and a spending beach with an average slope of 1 4 at the outlet position regular progressive surface waves with wave heights up to 7 5 cm and wave periods ranging from 0 66 to 1 33 s can be generated in the water channel facility the detailed description of the water channel facility and plunger type wave maker with the rigid boundary surface is provided in raushan et al 2019 three experimental runs were conducted for the oscillating flow cases ofc1 ofc2 and ofc3 table 1 and the data were collected at the different spatial locations from the grid at the four altered vertical locations from the bottom bed in the present experimental cases ofc1 ofc2 and ofc3 the ratio of flow depth h and observed wavelength l o i e h l o are 0 14 0 20 and 0 37 respectively the above ratio of h l o falls within the category of intermediate water wave in which waves are partly affected by bottom boundary similar to holthuijsen 2007 the schematic diagram of the water channel facility for oscillating flow cases with the passive grid is provided in fig 1 for the ease of comparison experimental run was also performed for uniform steady flow condition for the undisturbed case udc in fully developed region 11 m from the upstream end under the current flow case cfc here it is mentioned that the source of the turbulence for the undisturbed case under the current flow case has been used as the reference in the present experimental scheme a regular bi planar grid was vertically placed at a distance of 11 m from the channel inlet which is also sufficiently away from downstream boundary effects the mesh size m and rod diameter d b of the grid were 0 0105 m and 0 0015 m respectively the mesh reynolds number re m u max m ν and grid solidity ratio σ d b m 2 d b m were calculated as 1890 and 0 36 respectively the hydraulic parameters for the oscillating conditions are summarized in table 1 3 data analysis the three dimensional velocity data in the x y and z directions u v w at the different spatial positions with respect to the grid were collected by an acoustic doppler velocimeter adv with an accuracy 1 of measured velocity at each measurement point the data were collected for 5 min for satisfaction of the ergodicity condition bendat and piersol 2000 singh et al 2015 2016 2017 using the win adv software the raw adv time series data were filtered the detailed procedure of the raw adv data processing for the steady and oscillating flow cases can be found in singh and debnath 2016 panda et al 2018 mitra et al 2019 in order to reduce interference with the flow the cylindrical control volume was located 5 cm away from the probe tip and was approximately 0 09 cm3 during the collection of data at each measurement locations the flow was sowed with 7 10 μm diameter solid glass microspheres to achieve good quality of signal to noise ratio snr and signal correlation for the undisturbed case under the current flow condition cof in fully developed region the uncertainty analysis i e 95 confidence limit of adv data is presented in table 2 this analysis was performed by acquiring 12 sets of the measurements at z h 0 15 with sampling rate at 40 hz over a duration of 300 s tennekes and lumley 1972 singh et al 2019 at the each measurement points the turbulence statistics that were evaluated included mean velocities for steady flow case represented by u w however for oscillating flow cases the triple decomposition of instantaneous velocity in the stream wise direction were performed and are given as follows chiapponi et al 2012 tambroni et al 2015 singh et al 2016 paul et al 2020 1 u u u u where u and u are the turbulent velocity and wave velocity fluctuations respectively the wave induced orbital velocity u may be estimated by phase averaging the recorded velocity signal the wave induced orbital velocity is estimated as u u u where u is the phase averaged velocity the phase averaged velocity is expressed in the mathematical form by averaging over a velocity samples taken at a fixed phase umeyama 2005 raushan et al 2020 2 u 1 n c n 0 n c u t n t in equation 2 the notation n t and n c represent the wave cycle number period of wave and the total number of wave cycles respectively 4 results and discussion 4 1 evolution of phase averaged velocities in stream wise direction the phase averaged stream wise velocities with the corresponding errors are presented in fig 2 a d at four different levels from the boundary and are compared with the data of undisturbed case udc in the fully developed region fig 2 revealed that the phase averaged x velocity for the region x m 60 increases with the reduction in frequency of oscillation of the flow at z h 0 018 at z h 0 15 and 0 38 the phase averaged velocities are approximately constant and merges at the far field region x m 71 for all the cases tested here for the outer flow region z 0 65h the phase averaged velocities decrease with the increase in the oscillation frequency further the mean velocities at the locations x m 60 increases 22 for higher oscillation frequency case ofc3 in comparison to the undisturbed case udc at z 0 018h further at z 0 018h for locations x m 60 the velocity of the oscillatory flow cases ofc1 ofc2 and ofc3 are larger in comparison to the without grid case however it is also noted that the phase averaged velocities in the near field region are lesser in magnitude in comparison to the without grid case at z 0 15h 0 38h and 0 65h fig 2 a d reveal that the magnitude of phase averaged velocities for x m 115 follows homogeneity at z h 0 15 and 0 38 for the oscillating flow cases and is in good agreement with the finding of corrsin 1963 and mitra et al 2020 however at the free surface level z h 0 65 homogeneity is significantly affected by the oscillating nature of flow similar to the results of umeyama 2005 the generated vortices and turbulence are controlled and damped under the effect of bottom boundary in the far field region petti and longo 2001 pascolo et al 2018 4 2 mean dissipation rate and turbulence length scales to estimate the length scales in the grid generated turbulence under the oscillating flow cases the mean dissipation rate has been calculated from the velocity time series data similar to petti and longo 2001 in swash zone the mean dissipation rate is calculated by isotropic formula and velocity power spectrum methods similar to the krogstad and antonia 1999 the mean energy dissipation rate ε from the recorded data and spectrum method are evaluated as ε i s o 15 υ u 2 u t 2 ε s p k w 5 3 s u u c 3 2 respectively here k w 2 π f u and s u u 0 5 u f u u f π are wave number and spectral density function for stream wise velocity fluctuations respectively the signal was split into bands of 2048 data points and hence 5 bands for the undisturbed case was acquired under condition to keep down the noise level the degree of freedom for the analysis of the velocity power spectra was 10 which was dependent on the number of time samples per record and the number of segments the frequency resolution was 0 0195 hz from 0 to 20 hz with 95 confidence limit using psd algorithm with a hamming window singh et al 2018 by taking logarithm on the both side of the above spectral turbulent dissipation rate ε sp equation we get linear form 3 log s k w u u log c ε s p 2 3 5 3 log k w the above equation 3 is in the form of y a bx and by comparison we get y log s u u k w a log c ε s p 2 3 and b 5 3 the constants a and b were obtained to solve equation 3 with regression coefficient more than 88 using the least square optimization another method to verify the accuracy of the proposed method is that the evaluated value of b must be equal to 5 3 once the above conditions are satisfied the value of ε is evaluated from the estimated value of a the value of constant c is approximately equal to 0 5 0 05 over a wide range of reynolds number as suggested to similar to the sreenivasan and antonia 1997 monin and yaglom 2007 the values of k w 5 3 s u u was constant and corresponded to the inertial sub range of the wave number 4 ε s p 10 a c 3 2 the value of ε sp may be accurately evaluated using 5 3 power law of spectrum within the lower and higher wave number ranges for the without grid cases at z h 0 38 the estimates of mean dissipation rate from the spectrum method are shown in fig 3 a b the estimated values of turbulent dissipation rate ε iso are slightly more 10 14 than the turbulence dissipation rate ε sp obtained from spectrum method from the equilibrium dissipation law the dissipation coefficient is evaluated as c ε ε l x x u r m s 3 for the case of turbulent flows the evolution of mean dissipation rate ε i s o for oscillating flow cases along with the undisturbed case are presented in fig 4 the mean dissipation rate is greater closer to the grid and it decreases along the far field region at the elevation z h 0 018 for the lower oscillating frequency case ofc1 for ofc2 and ofc3 cases the values of mean dissipation rates are more in comparison to the ofc1 it is also revealed that the value of ε sp decreases from the bottom boundary level to main flow region for the oscillating flow cases the value of mean dissipation rate ε i s o for the ofc1 ofc2 and ofc3 cases merges with the without grid case data in the main flow region z h 0 65 the present experimental values of the dissipation rate ε i s o decreased traversing from the near field nf to the far field ff region a similar observation was also confirmed by murzyn and bélorgey 2005 in the water channel facility for only one mesh reynolds number condition fig 5 a b display the spatial variation of energy dissipation parameter cε and constant a for all the cases at the four different elevations from the bottom boundary a similar pattern of the energy dissipation parameter cε and constant a are also observed at the different spatial location for oscillatory flow cases at different vertical levels the length scales are the important parameter to understand the sizes of the eddies and the properties of suspended and gust particles in oscillatory flow environment oscillating grid cases grid generated turbulence surf and swash zone and wind generated environment petti and longo 2001 chiapponi et al 2012 the integral length scales are estimated using the autocorrelation function similar to hinze 1975 and imamura et al 2019 the estimation of the integral time scale t i can be achieved by integrating the autocorrelation function r ii τ in the stream wise direction up to the first zero crossing as suggested by tennekes et al 1972 and katul and parlange 1995 following the assumption of taylor s frozen turbulence hypothesis the integral length scales l xx in the stream wise direction has been evaluated here the mathematical equation for the integral time scale and length scale are given as follows 5 t i τ τ r i i τ 0 r i i τ d τ and l x x t i u where r ii t dτ and u denote the autocorrelation function time lag and mean velocities in the stream wise direction respectively the taylor micro scale λ and kolmogrov length scale ηk were evaluated to quantify the sizes of eddies for the grid generated turbulence in the steady flow and oscillatory flow domain these scales were estimated using the velocity time series data collected at the rate of 40 hz sampling frequencies for the duration 300 s the taylor micro scale λ can be evaluated by adopting the hypothesis of kolmogorov s second similarity hypothesis and is given as λ 15 ν u r m s 2 ε 0 5 the local reynolds number re λ u r m s λ ν was calculated based on the taylor scale similar to voth et al 2002 the kolmogrov s length scale is the scale at which energy is dissipated based on the mean dissipation rate and kinematic viscosity and can be calculated as η k ν 3 ε 0 25 pope 2000 petti and longo 2001 fig 6 shows the spatial evolution of the l xx in the flow direction at the upstream and downstream of the passive grid for the oscillatory flow cases and without grid case fig 6 reveals that the value of integral length scale decreases for x m 60 and it increases along the longitudinal direction for lower oscillating frequency when compared to the higher frequency similar to the vita et al 2018 the magnitudes of the integral length scales l xx are approximately constant in the far field regions x m 60 at z h 0 018 0 15 0 38 and 0 65 and the larger size of eddies are contained in the far field region for ofc1 ofc2 and ofc3 the spatial variation of the integral length scales have similar trend for the three oscillating flow cases which indicates that the macro vortices are not diffused petti and longo 2001 for the undisturbed case the magnitude of the integral length scale increases from the near boundary level towards the free surface which indicates that the larger size eddies dominate in the main flow region this is probably due to occurrence of difference in the mechanisms of boundary layer development for the grid generated turbulence in the water channel facility and wind tunnel study reported in arya 1999 and kozmar 2010 the spatial evolution of kolmogorov s ηk and taylor s length scales λ for all the flow cases at different levels from the bottom boundary z h 0 018 0 15 0 38 and 0 65 are displayed in fig 7 a b it is observed that the magnitudes of taylor s and kolmogorov s length scales are lesser at the elevation z h 0 018 than the other levels 0 15 0 38 and 0 65 for all the wave cases studied here this reflects that the average size of eddy increases away from the boundary region towards the main flow region it is also observed that the length scales for all the flow conditions the intermediate and the smaller size of the eddies are characterized by the taylors λ and the kolmogorov length scales ηk respectively in the main flow region the magnitude of kolmogorov length scale ηk increases as the distances along the stream wise direction increase for all the flow conditions similar to cardesa et al 2012 and raushan et al 2018 the magnitude of taylors length scales λ are lesser at the near field region of grid in comparison to the far field region at the levels z h 0 15 and 0 38 this observation is also confirmed by the results of laizet et al 2015 the trend of the length scales increasing from the bottom boundary region towards to the main flow region may be attributed to the fact that the exchange of momentum transfer reduces the turbulent energy dissipation rate for all the cases it may also be noted that the magnitude of the taylors λ and kolmogorov length scale ηk for the undisturbed case closely merge at the immediate downstream of the grid for ofc1 at the near boundary region the value of the kolmogorov length scale ηk for oscillating flow cases are less compared to the undisturbed case at the levels z h 0 15 0 38 and 0 65 respectively the kolmogorov length scale ηk decreases 27 for lower oscillation frequency case ofc1 compared to the undisturbed case udc at the level z h 0 65 at the free surface zone for the grid generated turbulence the kolmogorov length scales are greater for the ofc1 in comparison to ofc2 and ofc3 cases at the far field region the distribution of local reynolds number rλ at different spatial locations of the grid for all the flow cases at different levels from the bottom boundary are shown in fig 8 it is observed that the value of local reynolds number are relatively greater for the ofc1 case in comparison to the ofc2 and ofc3 cases at the elevation z h 0 018 the values of local reynolds number rλ for the cases ofc2 and ofc3 merges with the undisturbed case udc at the locations x m 60 for elevation z h 0 018 it may also be noted that the local reynolds number rλ at different spatial locations are less for the undisturbed case in comparison to the oscillating flow cases at the levels z h 0 15 0 38 and 0 65 a decaying trend of the local reynolds number rλ is observed along the stream wise direction for ofc3 the decaying trend of the local reynolds number rλ is in good agreement with özyilmaz 2010 4 3 anisotropic behaviour in oscillatory flow the occurrence of the anisotropic behaviour of flow in oscillating flow environment through the passive grid has been analysed by using the tool of reynolds stress anisotropy tensor lumley triangle the detailed description related to lumley triangle calculation of eigen values and the invariant function are provided in appendix section a fig 9 displays the anisotropy invariant map aim by plotting ξ against η at the different locations of the grid for oscillatory flow cases ofc1 ofc2 and ofc3 at different levels z h 0 018 0 15 0 38 and 0 65 from the bottom boundary in the invariant maps the axisymmetric contraction and expansion are represented by the left line and right line respectively further the left line join 2d and 3d vertices and the right line join 1d and 3d vertices in aim the data points shift downward above the right line of the aim for the ofc1 and ofc2 cases which indicates that the fluctuations are predominant along one direction at location x m 2 85 the occurrence of the data points on the right vertex indicates closeness to one component isotropy in the region x m 359 5 the positive and negative values of ξ indicates that the turbulence fluctuations exist along one and two directions for the ofc2 and ofc3 cases for ofc1 the values of ξ have positive values at all four different levels in far field region x m 359 5 the existence of the data points over the left vertex are characterized by rod like eddies and it reduces to two component axisymmetric isotropy simonsen and krogstad 2005 at z h 0 018 the values of η remarkably decreases due to the rigid boundary influence the turbulence reaches quasi isotropy at z h 0 7 over the smooth surface in current flow case the structure of turbulence mainly depends on the shape of eddies rather than on the shape of energy ellipsoid reynolds and kassinos 1995 from the anisotropy invariant maps fig 9 a c it is observed that the trajectories of anisotropic turbulence are not straight line through the origin vertices which shows that the return to isotropy of anisotropic turbulence is indeed a nonlinear process for all the tested cases here tucker 1970 gence and mathieu 1980 longo 2011 vita et al 2018 panda and warrior 2018b panda et al 2020b further at the location x m 359 5 for z h 0 65 data points fall near to the middle of the lumley triangle for the ofc2 case this represent that the turbulence field extends near to isotropic condition at level z h 0 65 the data points near to isotropic condition for the oscillatory flow and the undisturbed case are marked in the lumley triangle fig 9 the eigenvalues of the anisotropy tensor components λ 1 λ 2 and λ 3 are evaluated and plotted in fig 10 a d it is revealed that the value of λ1 is more in comparison to the λ3 for all the selected locations and the flow conditions studied here it is also noted that the eigenvalues of the tensor components occur in descendent order λ1 λ2 λ3 at the different levels for ofc1 ofc2 and ofc3 cases the spatial variation of the eigenvalue is uniform in the region x m 35 7 and the values of eigen values with λ 1 1 6 λ 2 0 and λ 3 1 6 shows that the occurrence of the turbulence is composition of two and three component states at z h 0 38 and 0 65 for oscillating flow cases stiperski and calaf 2018 radenković et al 2014 fig 11 a d display the variation of the invariant function if at the different spatial locations of the grid for four elevations from the boundary the spatial variation of the invariant function if shows that it has minimum values at the upstream and increases immediately in the nfr and thereafter decreases along the far field region for the ofc1 ofc2 and ofc3 cases at z h 0 018 the values of invariant function if in the region x m 2 85 are 0 38 at z h 0 018 indicates the appearance of two dimensional isotropy longo et al 2017 brugger et al 2018 further it is also noted that the value of invariant function if 0 8 means the flow tend to reach close to the three dimensional isotropic turbulence at z h 0 38 for the ofc1 4 4 shannon entropy to understand the degree of order or disorder in the grid generated turbulence for the oscillatory flow cases the shannon entropy s of random signal has been evaluated previous investigations such as sreenivasan 1991 and wijesekera 1996 suggested that the ranges of wave numbers are not self similar therefore the shannon entropy is an important statistical parameter to appreciate the topological structure in the turbulence flow region the detailed theory and mathematical description related to shannon entropy s are provided in comte bellot and corrsin 1966 poggi et al 2004 mihailović et al 2016 raushan et al 2020a the shannon entropy s is normalized by maximum possible value s f for the flat white noise spectrum for the oscillatory flow cases the term s s s f represents the normalized phase averaged shannon entropy fig 12 displays the spatial evolution of normalized phase averaged shannon entropy s of x velocity component at the different locations of the grid for the oscillating flow cases and their comparison with without grid case at the three different elevations the values of s are less at z h 0 018 in comparison to the other elevations in the nf region for wave current flow cases further the magnitude of normalized shannon entropy reduces due to increase in the oscillation frequency the present results are in good agreement with mihailović et al 2016 for flow over canopy model the normalized phase averaged shannon entropy values merge with the wave current flow cases in ff region at z h 0 65 for the ofc1 case the normalized phase averaged s values are less in comparison to the other frequency cases of oscillating flow at z 0 018h the normalized shannon entropy decreases 0 20 for lower oscillating flow case ofc1 in comparison to the undisturbed case at the level z h 0 65 at downstream of the grid this indicates that the smaller eddies are associated with less energy it may also be noted that the normalized phase averaged s values are less for the undisturbed case in comparison to the oscillating flow cases in the nf region at level z h 0 65 5 conclusion grid generated turbulence is widely used to understand the concept of anisotropic nature of flow in the water channel or wind tunnel experiment facility hence a clear understanding of flow structures for oscillating flow influenced grid generated turbulence with rigid boundary interaction is essential here an effort has been made to examine the outcome of altered oscillating frequencies on changes of turbulence characteristics passed through a grid under rigid boundary influence analysis of the data is performed within the framework of time and phase averaging and the achieved outcomes lead to the flowing conclusions the evolution of the phase averaged velocities reveal close to homogeneous turbulence for spatial regions x m 115 at z h 0 15 and 0 38 for all the oscillatory flow cases however non homogeneity prevails in the near field nf zone due the interaction of grid and the boundary the dissipation rate reduces from the bottom level to main flow region mfr for the oscillatory flow cases in the mfr z h 0 65 the value of mean dissipation rate ε i s o for the oscillating flow cases merges to the without grid case the values of l xx decrease at the nf regions in comparison to the ff regions and the values of l xx are greater along the longitudinal direction for ofc1 in comparison to ofc3 in the main flow region the magnitude of η k increases as the distances increase along the stream wise direction for both steady flow case and oscillating flow cases the magnitude of taylors length scales λ are less in the nf region compared to ff region at the elevations z h 0 15 and 0 38 the decaying trend of the local reynolds number rλ is observed along the stream wise direction for higher oscillating frequency the decreasing trend of the local reynolds number rλ is in good agreement with nagihan özyilmaz 2010 for the ofc1 the values of ξ take positive values at all four different vertical levels in ff region x m 359 5 the existence of the data points above the left line signifies that the anisotropic flow is characterized as rod like eddies longo et al 2017 the majority of the values of ξ and η lie above the right line in the turbulence triangle for the cases ofc1 and ofc2 which indicates that the fluctuations are dominant along one direction at location x m 2 85 the spatial variation of the eigenvalue is uniform in the ff region x m 35 7 and the values of eigenvalues with λ 1 1 6 λ 2 0 and λ 3 1 6 shows that the occurrence of the turbulence comprises of two and three component states at z h 0 38 and 0 65 for oscillating flow cases radenković et al 2014 stiperski and calaf 2018 the presented analysis in this paper can be used for understanding the different sizes of the eddies in terms of the length scales mean dissipation rate degree of randomness the behaviour of turbulent fluctuations in terms of its anisotropic and isotropic behaviour in the framework of turbulence triangle at the different spatial locations of the grid for the oscillatory flow cases proper understanding of turbulence

isentropic nature of turbulent flow field the anisotropic component of reynolds stress tensor along with its eigen values invariant functions and lumley triangle have been analysed in present study as described in previous works lumley and newman 1977 lumley 1978 longo et al 2017 panda et al 2017 brugger et al 2018 vita et al 2018 raushan et al 2020b these analyses are important in the context of heterogeneous nature of mass and momentum distribution in flow field as the anisotropic nature may trigger secondary current as well as it may tamper the pressure field distribution and turbulent flow structures the reynolds stress anisotropy tensor in non dimensional form is given as panda et al 2020a panda and warrior 2018a longo et al 2017 a 1 b i j u i w j q 2 1 3 δ i j u i w j 2 k 1 3 δ i j where k is the kinetic energy of turbulent fluctuations and δ i j is the kronecker delta operator now it is worthwhile to mention that here b ij is a second order tensor and it becomes zero for perfect isotropic condition in flow field but for an anisotropic flow it exists and it s eigen values can be obtained from the characteristic equation given as b i j λ δ i j 0 which after simplification ultimately leads to characteristic polynomial of b ij represented as a 2 λ 3 i 1 λ 2 i 2 λ i 3 0 where i 1 i 2 and i 3 are known as the first quadratic and cubic invariants of the

20978,the present work provides the turbulence characteristics of oscillating flow through passive grid under rigid boundary influence by adopting an experimental approach the oscillations in the steady unidirectional flow were generated by plunger type wave maker this study attempts to analyse the turbulent length scales and local reynolds numbers in order to characterise the different eddy sizes in the oscillating flow environment due to the interaction of grid and rigid boundary the normalized phase averaged shannon entropy is also presented to understand the degree of the randomness in oscillating flow environment through the passive grid further to understand the deviation from the isotropic turbulence the turbulence triangle eigen values and the invariant functions are presented at the downstream of the grid for the three oscillating flow cases keywords passive grid rigid boundary length scales turbulence triangle shannon entropy 1 introduction in general the screens and rods in form of mesh grids are generally placed in the test setup for breaking large scale turbulence structures but to produce turbulence grid may also be used in the experimental test setups for large reynolds number flows the latter usage and its flow characteristics at the near and far field region is what we are interested in and is explored here in grid generated turbulence substantial effort went into the accumulation of enormous quantity of reliable and accurate experimental data in order to confirm turbulence theories and models and was studied during the last few decades despite progresses in the measurement methods and instrumentations that led to acquire more accurate and reliable measurements satisfactory answers on the turbulence characteristics of oscillatory flow through grid and its interaction with bottom boundary is not available this is because in grid turbulence the flow characteristics depend on numerous aspects for e g the shape of the grid elements accuracy of the grid construction surface roughness of the grid rod elements and its solidity ratio corrsin 1963 uberoi and wallis 1967 further in oscillating grid the flow structure also depend on frequency and amplitude of oscillation of the grid hopfinger and toly 1976 in addition hancock and bradshaw 1983 introduced the concept of rigid boundaries and suggested that in grid turbulence rigid boundary introduce their own dissipative mechanics in the flow to examine the influence of the bottom boundary in the flow through grid hancock and bradshaw 1983 investigated the relative influence of length scale on the boundary layer the reduction of normal component of velocity fluctuation by solid wall is the probable reason for the increase in length scale and the decrease in free stream turbulence cheng and law 2001 studied the turbulence features due to oscillating grid in the direction perpendicular to the flow for a wide range of oscillating frequencies 1 4 hz hurst and vassilicos 2007 used fractal grids for their experiment and suggested that the fractal square grids endorse higher intensities of turbulence dean and dalrymple 1991 suggested that when the ratio of the flow depth h and wavelength l o is greater than 1 2 then the motion of wave induced water particles abates with flow depth and ultimately disappears at a depth comparable to half the wavelength in these conditions waves are not influenced by the boundary and these are known as deep water waves dww however when the ratio of flow depth and wavelength is less than 1 20 the water depth is not adequate to permit the entire wave motion development and waves are strongly influenced by the boundary as suggested by dean and dalrymple 1991 these waves are termed as shallow water waves sww for the criteria when the ratio of flow depth and wavelength lies between 1 20 to 1 2 waves are somewhat partially influenced by the boundary and these waves fall under the category of intermediate water waves iww in the present experimental cases ofc1 ofc2 and ofc3 the ratio of flow depth and observed wavelength i e h l o are 0 14 0 20 and 0 37 respectively the above ratio of h l o falls within the category of intermediate water waves iww in which waves are partly affected by bottom boundary one of the most important field based experiment works was explored in the surf and swash zone by petti and longo 2001 they suggested that the length scales are directly related to height of the wave and it increase towards the near boundary and decrease close to the surface in the swash zone long 1978 developed a theoretical model of study turbulence in homogeneous fluid induced by an oscillating grid longo 2011 studied experimentally the turbulence and the correlation with free surface and suggested that the process of stress transfer is controlled by the free surface chiapponi et al 2012 investigated experimentally the interaction between oscillating grid turbulence and free surface and used velocity and length scales to characterise the free surface dynamics it was further reported that the kinetic energy associated with the free surface fluctuations increases with the reynolds number at a rate dependent on frequency of grid oscillation longo et al 2013 performed analytical and experiment study of free surface fluctuation generated by grid stirred turbulence they suggested that if the forcing period has dual peaks a detonate of oscillator is predict mccorquodale and munro 2017 studied experimentally using piv and suggested the three main mechanisms governing the interaction of grid generated turbulence with the turbulence generated from solid boundary viscous effect return to isotropy and turbulent transport recently raushan et al 2019 experimentally investigated the effect of rigid boundary on grid generated turbulence and concluded that the near field flow region of the grid depends on the mesh size whereas at the far field region of the grid the flow characteristics are more or less independent of the mesh size the current work is different from the oscillating grid turbulence which was performed by longo et al 2013 in the present work the turbulent characteristics of the oscillating fluid flow through the passive grid under the consideration of bottom boundary is analysed rather than the vertically oscillating grid in water tank the present work focuses on the spatial evolution of turbulence structure of the oscillating fluid movement that passed through the passive grid for the three oscillating flow cases the changes due to the three different superimposing oscillating frequencies on steady unidirectional current at the downstream spatial positions of the grids are in contrast to the without grid case in the fully developed state the approach of time and phase averaging is applied on the three dimensional instantaneous time series recorded velocity data the presented result is useful in acquiring knowledge on the mean dissipation rate length scales degree of the order or disorder lumley triangle and the invariant function under oscillating flow conditions and boundary influence in the flow the results are presented at the different spatial locations downstream of grid 2 experimental setup and methodology the experimental study on grid generated turbulence for oscillating flows was carried out in a wave flume the channel is 18 m long 0 90 m wide and 0 90 m deep and equipped with a servo controlled wave maker to create oscillations in the flow at the inlet position and a spending beach with an average slope of 1 4 at the outlet position regular progressive surface waves with wave heights up to 7 5 cm and wave periods ranging from 0 66 to 1 33 s can be generated in the water channel facility the detailed description of the water channel facility and plunger type wave maker with the rigid boundary surface is provided in raushan et al 2019 three experimental runs were conducted for the oscillating flow cases ofc1 ofc2 and ofc3 table 1 and the data were collected at the different spatial locations from the grid at the four altered vertical locations from the bottom bed in the present experimental cases ofc1 ofc2 and ofc3 the ratio of flow depth h and observed wavelength l o i e h l o are 0 14 0 20 and 0 37 respectively the above ratio of h l o falls within the category of intermediate water wave in which waves are partly affected by bottom boundary similar to holthuijsen 2007 the schematic diagram of the water channel facility for oscillating flow cases with the passive grid is provided in fig 1 for the ease of comparison experimental run was also performed for uniform steady flow condition for the undisturbed case udc in fully developed region 11 m from the upstream end under the current flow case cfc here it is mentioned that the source of the turbulence for the undisturbed case under the current flow case has been used as the reference in the present experimental scheme a regular bi planar grid was vertically placed at a distance of 11 m from the channel inlet which is also sufficiently away from downstream boundary effects the mesh size m and rod diameter d b of the grid were 0 0105 m and 0 0015 m respectively the mesh reynolds number re m u max m ν and grid solidity ratio σ d b m 2 d b m were calculated as 1890 and 0 36 respectively the hydraulic parameters for the oscillating conditions are summarized in table 1 3 data analysis the three dimensional velocity data in the x y and z directions u v w at the different spatial positions with respect to the grid were collected by an acoustic doppler velocimeter adv with an accuracy 1 of measured velocity at each measurement point the data were collected for 5 min for satisfaction of the ergodicity condition bendat and piersol 2000 singh et al 2015 2016 2017 using the win adv software the raw adv time series data were filtered the detailed procedure of the raw adv data processing for the steady and oscillating flow cases can be found in singh and debnath 2016 panda et al 2018 mitra et al 2019 in order to reduce interference with the flow the cylindrical control volume was located 5 cm away from the probe tip and was approximately 0 09 cm3 during the collection of data at each measurement locations the flow was sowed with 7 10 μm diameter solid glass microspheres to achieve good quality of signal to noise ratio snr and signal correlation for the undisturbed case under the current flow condition cof in fully developed region the uncertainty analysis i e 95 confidence limit of adv data is presented in table 2 this analysis was performed by acquiring 12 sets of the measurements at z h 0 15 with sampling rate at 40 hz over a duration of 300 s tennekes and lumley 1972 singh et al 2019 at the each measurement points the turbulence statistics that were evaluated included mean velocities for steady flow case represented by u w however for oscillating flow cases the triple decomposition of instantaneous velocity in the stream wise direction were performed and are given as follows chiapponi et al 2012 tambroni et al 2015 singh et al 2016 paul et al 2020 1 u u u u where u and u are the turbulent velocity and wave velocity fluctuations respectively the wave induced orbital velocity u may be estimated by phase averaging the recorded velocity signal the wave induced orbital velocity is estimated as u u u where u is the phase averaged velocity the phase averaged velocity is expressed in the mathematical form by averaging over a velocity samples taken at a fixed phase umeyama 2005 raushan et al 2020 2 u 1 n c n 0 n c u t n t in equation 2 the notation n t and n c represent the wave cycle number period of wave and the total number of wave cycles respectively 4 results and discussion 4 1 evolution of phase averaged velocities in stream wise direction the phase averaged stream wise velocities with the corresponding errors are presented in fig 2 a d at four different levels from the boundary and are compared with the data of undisturbed case udc in the fully developed region fig 2 revealed that the phase averaged x velocity for the region x m 60 increases with the reduction in frequency of oscillation of the flow at z h 0 018 at z h 0 15 and 0 38 the phase averaged velocities are approximately constant and merges at the far field region x m 71 for all the cases tested here for the outer flow region z 0 65h the phase averaged velocities decrease with the increase in the oscillation frequency further the mean velocities at the locations x m 60 increases 22 for higher oscillation frequency case ofc3 in comparison to the undisturbed case udc at z 0 018h further at z 0 018h for locations x m 60 the velocity of the oscillatory flow cases ofc1 ofc2 and ofc3 are larger in comparison to the without grid case however it is also noted that the phase averaged velocities in the near field region are lesser in magnitude in comparison to the without grid case at z 0 15h 0 38h and 0 65h fig 2 a d reveal that the magnitude of phase averaged velocities for x m 115 follows homogeneity at z h 0 15 and 0 38 for the oscillating flow cases and is in good agreement with the finding of corrsin 1963 and mitra et al 2020 however at the free surface level z h 0 65 homogeneity is significantly affected by the oscillating nature of flow similar to the results of umeyama 2005 the generated vortices and turbulence are controlled and damped under the effect of bottom boundary in the far field region petti and longo 2001 pascolo et al 2018 4 2 mean dissipation rate and turbulence length scales to estimate the length scales in the grid generated turbulence under the oscillating flow cases the mean dissipation rate has been calculated from the velocity time series data similar to petti and longo 2001 in swash zone the mean dissipation rate is calculated by isotropic formula and velocity power spectrum methods similar to the krogstad and antonia 1999 the mean energy dissipation rate ε from the recorded data and spectrum method are evaluated as ε i s o 15 υ u 2 u t 2 ε s p k w 5 3 s u u c 3 2 respectively here k w 2 π f u and s u u 0 5 u f u u f π are wave number and spectral density function for stream wise velocity fluctuations respectively the signal was split into bands of 2048 data points and hence 5 bands for the undisturbed case was acquired under condition to keep down the noise level the degree of freedom for the analysis of the velocity power spectra was 10 which was dependent on the number of time samples per record and the number of segments the frequency resolution was 0 0195 hz from 0 to 20 hz with 95 confidence limit using psd algorithm with a hamming window singh et al 2018 by taking logarithm on the both side of the above spectral turbulent dissipation rate ε sp equation we get linear form 3 log s k w u u log c ε s p 2 3 5 3 log k w the above equation 3 is in the form of y a bx and by comparison we get y log s u u k w a log c ε s p 2 3 and b 5 3 the constants a and b were obtained to solve equation 3 with regression coefficient more than 88 using the least square optimization another method to verify the accuracy of the proposed method is that the evaluated value of b must be equal to 5 3 once the above conditions are satisfied the value of ε is evaluated from the estimated value of a the value of constant c is approximately equal to 0 5 0 05 over a wide range of reynolds number as suggested to similar to the sreenivasan and antonia 1997 monin and yaglom 2007 the values of k w 5 3 s u u was constant and corresponded to the inertial sub range of the wave number 4 ε s p 10 a c 3 2 the value of ε sp may be accurately evaluated using 5 3 power law of spectrum within the lower and higher wave number ranges for the without grid cases at z h 0 38 the estimates of mean dissipation rate from the spectrum method are shown in fig 3 a b the estimated values of turbulent dissipation rate ε iso are slightly more 10 14 than the turbulence dissipation rate ε sp obtained from spectrum method from the equilibrium dissipation law the dissipation coefficient is evaluated as c ε ε l x x u r m s 3 for the case of turbulent flows the evolution of mean dissipation rate ε i s o for oscillating flow cases along with the undisturbed case are presented in fig 4 the mean dissipation rate is greater closer to the grid and it decreases along the far field region at the elevation z h 0 018 for the lower oscillating frequency case ofc1 for ofc2 and ofc3 cases the values of mean dissipation rates are more in comparison to the ofc1 it is also revealed that the value of ε sp decreases from the bottom boundary level to main flow region for the oscillating flow cases the value of mean dissipation rate ε i s o for the ofc1 ofc2 and ofc3 cases merges with the without grid case data in the main flow region z h 0 65 the present experimental values of the dissipation rate ε i s o decreased traversing from the near field nf to the far field ff region a similar observation was also confirmed by murzyn and bélorgey 2005 in the water channel facility for only one mesh reynolds number condition fig 5 a b display the spatial variation of energy dissipation parameter cε and constant a for all the cases at the four different elevations from the bottom boundary a similar pattern of the energy dissipation parameter cε and constant a are also observed at the different spatial location for oscillatory flow cases at different vertical levels the length scales are the important parameter to understand the sizes of the eddies and the properties of suspended and gust particles in oscillatory flow environment oscillating grid cases grid generated turbulence surf and swash zone and wind generated environment petti and longo 2001 chiapponi et al 2012 the integral length scales are estimated using the autocorrelation function similar to hinze 1975 and imamura et al 2019 the estimation of the integral time scale t i can be achieved by integrating the autocorrelation function r ii τ in the stream wise direction up to the first zero crossing as suggested by tennekes et al 1972 and katul and parlange 1995 following the assumption of taylor s frozen turbulence hypothesis the integral length scales l xx in the stream wise direction has been evaluated here the mathematical equation for the integral time scale and length scale are given as follows 5 t i τ τ r i i τ 0 r i i τ d τ and l x x t i u where r ii t dτ and u denote the autocorrelation function time lag and mean velocities in the stream wise direction respectively the taylor micro scale λ and kolmogrov length scale ηk were evaluated to quantify the sizes of eddies for the grid generated turbulence in the steady flow and oscillatory flow domain these scales were estimated using the velocity time series data collected at the rate of 40 hz sampling frequencies for the duration 300 s the taylor micro scale λ can be evaluated by adopting the hypothesis of kolmogorov s second similarity hypothesis and is given as λ 15 ν u r m s 2 ε 0 5 the local reynolds number re λ u r m s λ ν was calculated based on the taylor scale similar to voth et al 2002 the kolmogrov s length scale is the scale at which energy is dissipated based on the mean dissipation rate and kinematic viscosity and can be calculated as η k ν 3 ε 0 25 pope 2000 petti and longo 2001 fig 6 shows the spatial evolution of the l xx in the flow direction at the upstream and downstream of the passive grid for the oscillatory flow cases and without grid case fig 6 reveals that the value of integral length scale decreases for x m 60 and it increases along the longitudinal direction for lower oscillating frequency when compared to the higher frequency similar to the vita et al 2018 the magnitudes of the integral length scales l xx are approximately constant in the far field regions x m 60 at z h 0 018 0 15 0 38 and 0 65 and the larger size of eddies are contained in the far field region for ofc1 ofc2 and ofc3 the spatial variation of the integral length scales have similar trend for the three oscillating flow cases which indicates that the macro vortices are not diffused petti and longo 2001 for the undisturbed case the magnitude of the integral length scale increases from the near boundary level towards the free surface which indicates that the larger size eddies dominate in the main flow region this is probably due to occurrence of difference in the mechanisms of boundary layer development for the grid generated turbulence in the water channel facility and wind tunnel study reported in arya 1999 and kozmar 2010 the spatial evolution of kolmogorov s ηk and taylor s length scales λ for all the flow cases at different levels from the bottom boundary z h 0 018 0 15 0 38 and 0 65 are displayed in fig 7 a b it is observed that the magnitudes of taylor s and kolmogorov s length scales are lesser at the elevation z h 0 018 than the other levels 0 15 0 38 and 0 65 for all the wave cases studied here this reflects that the average size of eddy increases away from the boundary region towards the main flow region it is also observed that the length scales for all the flow conditions the intermediate and the smaller size of the eddies are characterized by the taylors λ and the kolmogorov length scales ηk respectively in the main flow region the magnitude of kolmogorov length scale ηk increases as the distances along the stream wise direction increase for all the flow conditions similar to cardesa et al 2012 and raushan et al 2018 the magnitude of taylors length scales λ are lesser at the near field region of grid in comparison to the far field region at the levels z h 0 15 and 0 38 this observation is also confirmed by the results of laizet et al 2015 the trend of the length scales increasing from the bottom boundary region towards to the main flow region may be attributed to the fact that the exchange of momentum transfer reduces the turbulent energy dissipation rate for all the cases it may also be noted that the magnitude of the taylors λ and kolmogorov length scale ηk for the undisturbed case closely merge at the immediate downstream of the grid for ofc1 at the near boundary region the value of the kolmogorov length scale ηk for oscillating flow cases are less compared to the undisturbed case at the levels z h 0 15 0 38 and 0 65 respectively the kolmogorov length scale ηk decreases 27 for lower oscillation frequency case ofc1 compared to the undisturbed case udc at the level z h 0 65 at the free surface zone for the grid generated turbulence the kolmogorov length scales are greater for the ofc1 in comparison to ofc2 and ofc3 cases at the far field region the distribution of local reynolds number rλ at different spatial locations of the grid for all the flow cases at different levels from the bottom boundary are shown in fig 8 it is observed that the value of local reynolds number are relatively greater for the ofc1 case in comparison to the ofc2 and ofc3 cases at the elevation z h 0 018 the values of local reynolds number rλ for the cases ofc2 and ofc3 merges with the undisturbed case udc at the locations x m 60 for elevation z h 0 018 it may also be noted that the local reynolds number rλ at different spatial locations are less for the undisturbed case in comparison to the oscillating flow cases at the levels z h 0 15 0 38 and 0 65 a decaying trend of the local reynolds number rλ is observed along the stream wise direction for ofc3 the decaying trend of the local reynolds number rλ is in good agreement with özyilmaz 2010 4 3 anisotropic behaviour in oscillatory flow the occurrence of the anisotropic behaviour of flow in oscillating flow environment through the passive grid has been analysed by using the tool of reynolds stress anisotropy tensor lumley triangle the detailed description related to lumley triangle calculation of eigen values and the invariant function are provided in appendix section a fig 9 displays the anisotropy invariant map aim by plotting ξ against η at the different locations of the grid for oscillatory flow cases ofc1 ofc2 and ofc3 at different levels z h 0 018 0 15 0 38 and 0 65 from the bottom boundary in the invariant maps the axisymmetric contraction and expansion are represented by the left line and right line respectively further the left line join 2d and 3d vertices and the right line join 1d and 3d vertices in aim the data points shift downward above the right line of the aim for the ofc1 and ofc2 cases which indicates that the fluctuations are predominant along one direction at location x m 2 85 the occurrence of the data points on the right vertex indicates closeness to one component isotropy in the region x m 359 5 the positive and negative values of ξ indicates that the turbulence fluctuations exist along one and two directions for the ofc2 and ofc3 cases for ofc1 the values of ξ have positive values at all four different levels in far field region x m 359 5 the existence of the data points over the left vertex are characterized by rod like eddies and it reduces to two component axisymmetric isotropy simonsen and krogstad 2005 at z h 0 018 the values of η remarkably decreases due to the rigid boundary influence the turbulence reaches quasi isotropy at z h 0 7 over the smooth surface in current flow case the structure of turbulence mainly depends on the shape of eddies rather than on the shape of energy ellipsoid reynolds and kassinos 1995 from the anisotropy invariant maps fig 9 a c it is observed that the trajectories of anisotropic turbulence are not straight line through the origin vertices which shows that the return to isotropy of anisotropic turbulence is indeed a nonlinear process for all the tested cases here tucker 1970 gence and mathieu 1980 longo 2011 vita et al 2018 panda and warrior 2018b panda et al 2020b further at the location x m 359 5 for z h 0 65 data points fall near to the middle of the lumley triangle for the ofc2 case this represent that the turbulence field extends near to isotropic condition at level z h 0 65 the data points near to isotropic condition for the oscillatory flow and the undisturbed case are marked in the lumley triangle fig 9 the eigenvalues of the anisotropy tensor components λ 1 λ 2 and λ 3 are evaluated and plotted in fig 10 a d it is revealed that the value of λ1 is more in comparison to the λ3 for all the selected locations and the flow conditions studied here it is also noted that the eigenvalues of the tensor components occur in descendent order λ1 λ2 λ3 at the different levels for ofc1 ofc2 and ofc3 cases the spatial variation of the eigenvalue is uniform in the region x m 35 7 and the values of eigen values with λ 1 1 6 λ 2 0 and λ 3 1 6 shows that the occurrence of the turbulence is composition of two and three component states at z h 0 38 and 0 65 for oscillating flow cases stiperski and calaf 2018 radenković et al 2014 fig 11 a d display the variation of the invariant function if at the different spatial locations of the grid for four elevations from the boundary the spatial variation of the invariant function if shows that it has minimum values at the upstream and increases immediately in the nfr and thereafter decreases along the far field region for the ofc1 ofc2 and ofc3 cases at z h 0 018 the values of invariant function if in the region x m 2 85 are 0 38 at z h 0 018 indicates the appearance of two dimensional isotropy longo et al 2017 brugger et al 2018 further it is also noted that the value of invariant function if 0 8 means the flow tend to reach close to the three dimensional isotropic turbulence at z h 0 38 for the ofc1 4 4 shannon entropy to understand the degree of order or disorder in the grid generated turbulence for the oscillatory flow cases the shannon entropy s of random signal has been evaluated previous investigations such as sreenivasan 1991 and wijesekera 1996 suggested that the ranges of wave numbers are not self similar therefore the shannon entropy is an important statistical parameter to appreciate the topological structure in the turbulence flow region the detailed theory and mathematical description related to shannon entropy s are provided in comte bellot and corrsin 1966 poggi et al 2004 mihailović et al 2016 raushan et al 2020a the shannon entropy s is normalized by maximum possible value s f for the flat white noise spectrum for the oscillatory flow cases the term s s s f represents the normalized phase averaged shannon entropy fig 12 displays the spatial evolution of normalized phase averaged shannon entropy s of x velocity component at the different locations of the grid for the oscillating flow cases and their comparison with without grid case at the three different elevations the values of s are less at z h 0 018 in comparison to the other elevations in the nf region for wave current flow cases further the magnitude of normalized shannon entropy reduces due to increase in the oscillation frequency the present results are in good agreement with mihailović et al 2016 for flow over canopy model the normalized phase averaged shannon entropy values merge with the wave current flow cases in ff region at z h 0 65 for the ofc1 case the normalized phase averaged s values are less in comparison to the other frequency cases of oscillating flow at z 0 018h the normalized shannon entropy decreases 0 20 for lower oscillating flow case ofc1 in comparison to the undisturbed case at the level z h 0 65 at downstream of the grid this indicates that the smaller eddies are associated with less energy it may also be noted that the normalized phase averaged s values are less for the undisturbed case in comparison to the oscillating flow cases in the nf region at level z h 0 65 5 conclusion grid generated turbulence is widely used to understand the concept of anisotropic nature of flow in the water channel or wind tunnel experiment facility hence a clear understanding of flow structures for oscillating flow influenced grid generated turbulence with rigid boundary interaction is essential here an effort has been made to examine the outcome of altered oscillating frequencies on changes of turbulence characteristics passed through a grid under rigid boundary influence analysis of the data is performed within the framework of time and phase averaging and the achieved outcomes lead to the flowing conclusions the evolution of the phase averaged velocities reveal close to homogeneous turbulence for spatial regions x m 115 at z h 0 15 and 0 38 for all the oscillatory flow cases however non homogeneity prevails in the near field nf zone due the interaction of grid and the boundary the dissipation rate reduces from the bottom level to main flow region mfr for the oscillatory flow cases in the mfr z h 0 65 the value of mean dissipation rate ε i s o for the oscillating flow cases merges to the without grid case the values of l xx decrease at the nf regions in comparison to the ff regions and the values of l xx are greater along the longitudinal direction for ofc1 in comparison to ofc3 in the main flow region the magnitude of η k increases as the distances increase along the stream wise direction for both steady flow case and oscillating flow cases the magnitude of taylors length scales λ are less in the nf region compared to ff region at the elevations z h 0 15 and 0 38 the decaying trend of the local reynolds number rλ is observed along the stream wise direction for higher oscillating frequency the decreasing trend of the local reynolds number rλ is in good agreement with nagihan özyilmaz 2010 for the ofc1 the values of ξ take positive values at all four different vertical levels in ff region x m 359 5 the existence of the data points above the left line signifies that the anisotropic flow is characterized as rod like eddies longo et al 2017 the majority of the values of ξ and η lie above the right line in the turbulence triangle for the cases ofc1 and ofc2 which indicates that the fluctuations are dominant along one direction at location x m 2 85 the spatial variation of the eigenvalue is uniform in the ff region x m 35 7 and the values of eigenvalues with λ 1 1 6 λ 2 0 and λ 3 1 6 shows that the occurrence of the turbulence comprises of two and three component states at z h 0 38 and 0 65 for oscillating flow cases radenković et al 2014 stiperski and calaf 2018 the presented analysis in this paper can be used for understanding the different sizes of the eddies in terms of the length scales mean dissipation rate degree of randomness the behaviour of turbulent fluctuations in terms of its anisotropic and isotropic behaviour in the framework of turbulence triangle at the different spatial locations of the grid for the oscillatory flow cases proper understanding of turbulence

heterogeneous nature of mass and momentum distribution in flow field as the anisotropic nature may trigger secondary current as well as it may tamper the pressure field distribution and turbulent flow

where k is the kinetic energy of turbulent fluctuations and δ i j is the kronecker delta operator now it is worthwhile to mention that here b ij is a second order tensor and it becomes zero for perfect isotropic condition in flow field but for an anisotropic flow it exists and it s eigen values can be obtained from the characteristic equation given as b i j λ δ i j 0 which after

20979,in order to solve the problem that the parameterized los line of sight guidance cannot be directly applied to the navigation practice this paper proposed an indirect nonlinear feedback concise robust track keeping control strategy for ships which consists of a robust course keeping controller and a milos multi technique improved los guidance system the second order closed loop gain shaping algorithm was employed to design the linear course keeping controller then the fuzzy logic system was used to adjust the integral coefficient online to improve the transient performance the introduction of nonlinear feedback technique further reduces the steering frequency and saves energy for the guidance system three techniques are introduced to enhance the track keeping effect a nonlinear sideslip angle observer is developed to eliminate the static track error caused by the wind and current interference a time varying lookahead distance and a new advance turning distance are proposed to achieve the smooth turning between track sections simulation results show that compared with the conventional los guidance the proposed strategy is more consistent with the requirement of navigation practice and has comprehensive advantages in both dynamic and static performance which is of great significance for enhancing the ability of ship s autonomous navigation keywords track keeping closed loop gain shaping nonlinear feedback milos guidance 1 introduction track keeping control is an important research direction in the ship motion control field especially for long distance navigation the automatic control can reduce the labor intensity of seaman and improve the operation efficiency which can increase the safety of navigation therefore it is of great importance to design a track keeping controller with good control performance low steering frequency and strong robustness fossen 2011 do 2010 zhang and zhang 2013 with the prosperity of control theory various advanced control strategies have been applied to the design of ship s track keeping controller track keeping control for ships can be divided into path following control and trajectory tracking control in this paper we emphasize on the path following control where the target track is time independent wen et al 2020 designed the ship path following controller based on the characteristic model which was convenient to adjust the controller structure as the navigation environment changes do 2016 used the backstepping method to design a robust adaptive path following controller deng et al 2019 designed a path following controller for a sail assisted ship fuzzy logic system was employed to optimize its speed the above results belong to the direct track keeping strategy that is the track error is used to directly drive the controller to give the rudder angle to make the ship to track target path the opposite method is the indirect track keeping strategy which divides the entire control system into a guidance system and a course keeping controller the guidance system uses the track error to generate reference course then the course keeping controller tracks the reference course making the track error converge to zero the indirect track keeping strategy is more consistent with the action of seafarers in practice it has a simple structure along with the feature of convenient for operator to switch between course keeping and track keeping modes the guidance system has a critical impact on the track keeping control effect fossen et al 2002 gao et al 2015 among the existing researches the parameterized los guidance is extensively used fossen et al 2014 serrano et al 2014 where the target track is expressed as the parametric equation of a variable the advantage of this method is that it is suitable for the tracking of curved path to construct the parametric track the following three methods are selected by most literatures in xia et al 2019 the desired sinusoidal track was directly given in the form of a parametric equation in lekkas 2014 each waypoint was first given then the cubic spline interpolation was used to construct the desired parametric track between the waypoints deng 2019 used straight lines and arcs to connect waypoints to form the parametric track which was equivalent to preset turning points and turning radius in the above three methods the curved path is introduced to the desired path to varying degrees the tracking of curved track is not so practical in navigation practice especially for some large tankers it is nearly impossible due to the large time delay characteristic in nautical practice seaman first set a few waypoints and connect them only with straight lines which is also called a waypoint based navigation mode when there is an appropriate distance from the ship to the next waypoint the helmsman steers the ship to turn in advance for parameterized los the way of setting target track is different from that in practice and the action of turning in advance is also not included therefore the conventional non parameterized los with an advance turning strategy is more in accord with the requirements of navigation practice the conventional los method with an advance turning strategy still has the following three problems to be solved 1 under the interference of wind and current the sideslip angle will cause a static track error due to the high cost of measuring the sideslip angle many solutions had been put forward borhaug et al 2008 added an error integral term to the los angle presenting the ilos guidance method fossen et al 2014 proposed alos guidance where an adaptive parameter was used to estimate the constant sideslip angle liu et al 2016 proposed plos guidance based on two predictors of track error which could reduce the oscillation during transient period liu et al 2017b used reduced order eso to estimate sideslip angle the above methods are all based on the parameterized los guidance to design the sideslip angle adaptive law or observer which cannot be directly used in the conventional los guidance with advance turning strategy 2 there are two methods for obtaining the lookahead distance which is an important parameter in los guidance the enclosure based scheme can achieve better transient performance but its calculation is complicated the method to set a constant lookahead distance is simple and feasible yet poorly adjusted parameters may cause slower convergence or make the ship s position oscillate on two sides of the target track the time varying lookahead distance developed by lekkas and fossen 2012 had the advantages of the above two methods which had been successfully used in parameterized los nevertheless it has not been applied in conventional los scheme 3 the conventional los guidance requires the ship to turn in advance at a distance of 2 2 times the ship s length from the waypoint khaled et al 2013 if the angle of turning the angle between the original track section and the new track section is relatively large the ship may deviate from the desired track by a long distance when turning therefore the setting of the advance turning distance also needs to be modified the solving of the first problem will improve the track keeping accuracy while the other two is related to the system s dynamic performance with respect to the course keeping controller the control law should have a concise form and fewer parameters ensuring that it can be understood well by engineers meanwhile it should possess good robustness to overcome parameter uncertainty model perturbation and external interference pid controller and fuzzy controller are two typical control strategies that meet the above requirements pid control has the characteristics of simplicity but its parameter tuning is rather complex tuning it by specific theory such as the closed loop gain shaping algorithm can ensure the control effect zhang et al 2018 zhao et al 2019 another problem of pid control is that the output energy is relatively large especially its differential part is sensitive to noise which may lead to high frequency and large magnitude rudder angle output in order to solve this problem zhang and zhang 2016 proposed the nonlinear feedback technique which replaces the original error with the error signal decorated by the nonlinear function to save energy fan et al 2018 applied nonlinear feedback technique to usv unmanned surface vessel successfully which proved its engineering availability fuzzy control is also widely used in course keeping controllers velagic 2003 omerdic 2003 which directly gives the controller output according to the error and its changing rate however due to its lack of integral terms in principle the static error cannot be eliminated under the effect of interference meanwhile the zero rudder angle cannot be stably given when the error is small causing additional energy consumption fuzzy pid technique uses human experienced based fuzzy rules to adjust three parameters online to improve the adaptability of pid control ding 2009 regarded the speed as a condition of fuzzy inference so that the fuzzy pid controller could adapt to task with different speeds cheng 2001 designed a multi mode fuzzy pid controller which could choose fuzzy p control or fuzzy pd control under different scenarios such as track keeping and turning the effect of fuzzy pid control is also highly related to the selection of initial parameters to guarantee good control effect they can be tuned based on the closed loop gain shaping algorithm as well inspired by the above results this paper proposes an indirect ship track keeping strategy that meets the requirements of navigation practice the contributions are mainly twofold 1 for the course keeping controller a pid controller with a first order filter is designed using the second order closed loop gain shaping algorithm the fuzzy logic system and nonlinear feedback technique are further introduced to improve transient performance and save energy 2 for the guidance system on the basis of conventional los guidance three techniques including a nonlinear sideslip angle observer a time varying lookahead distance and a new advance turning distance are introduced to propose a milos guidance which can enhance both dynamic and static performance 2 ship motion mathematical model 2 1 kinematic model according to jia and yang 1999 the plane kinematics equation of a three freedom ship model can be expressed as 1 x u cos ψ v sin ψ y u sin ψ v cos ψ ψ r 2 2 kinetics model 2 2 1 nonlinear nomoto model 2 ψ k 0 t 0 α ψ β ψ 3 k 0 t 0 δ where ψ is the heading angle δ is the rudder angle k 0 t 0 are ship s manoeuvrability indices α β are nonlinear parameters if the nonlinear term in the equation is ignored the classical linear nomoto model for controller design can be expressed as g ψ δ k 0 s t 0 s 1 in this paper the linear nomoto model is used for course keeping controller design which can ensure the control law has a lower order form while the nonlinear nomoto model is used in course keeping and single section track keeping control simulation experiment because of its rather good accuracy from the compared experiment in zhang et al 2018 the simulation results of nonlinear nomoto model was consistent at a high level with the real ship trail test data 2 2 2 nonlinear norrbin model 3 x 2 a 2 x 2 b 2 δ i 2 1 f non f wind f wave the basic form of the nonlinear norrbin model is shown in equation 3 which superimposes nonlinear hydrodynamics wind and wave forces on the basis of the basic linear model where x 2 v r t i 2 is the inertial force derivative matrix a 2 b 2 are linear equation coefficient matrices f non f wind and f wave are matrixes of nonlinear fluid force wind force and wave force respectively one can refer zhang and jin 2013 for specific expressions unlike nonlinear nomoto model both the dynamic of ship s yaw and sway motion can be reflected in it which is suitable for the simulation scenario where the changing of ship s course must be considered the nonlinear norrbin model 3 and equation 1 will be used in multi section track keeping simulation experiment 2 3 environmental interference model 1 for wind interference it can be divided into average wind and pulse wind the average wind can be converted into the wind equivalent rudder angle by using equation 4 and the pulse wind is simulated by the white noise kallstrom 1982 4 δ w k v w v l sin θ where v w is wind speed v l is ship speed and k is leeway coefficient 2 the wave disturbance can be treated equivalent to a simplified linear model which expressed as a typical second order oscillation system driven by a gaussian white noise the wave disturbance acts directly on the ship s course the models of wave disturbance recognized by ittc under the wind scale of beaufort no 6 is 5 ψ h 0 4198 s s 2 0 3638 s 0 3675 w h where w h s ψ h are gaussian white noise laplace operator and high frequency wave disturbance 3 for ocean current interference it is expressed by the change of ship speed the ship speed u v and the first two lines of equation 1 are modified as follows 6 u u r v c cos γ c ψ v v r v c sin γ c ψ 7 x u r cos ψ v r sin ψ v c cos γ c y u r sin ψ v r cos ψ v c sin γ c where u r and v r is the speed of the ship relative to the water v c is the current velocity and γ c is the current direction 3 course keeping controller design 3 1 linear robust controller design according to the principle of an indirect track keeping control system a course keeping controller is supposed to be employed to control the ship to track the reference course generated by the guidance system considering linear nomoto model g ψ δ k 0 s t 0 s 1 the linear robust course keeping controller can be designed through the second order closed loop gain shaping algorithm zhang 2012 the closed loop gain shaping algorithm is presented through the observation of the singular value curve of h control mixed sensitivity and the correlation between sensitivity function s and complementary sensitivity function t the typical s t singular value curve is shown in fig 1 in order to make the system robust and stable the closed loop spectrum of the system is required to be low pass and the maximum singular value is 1 to ensure that the reference signal is tracked with no steady state error set the bandwidth frequency of the closed loop system to 1 t 1 crossover frequency in the strict sense let the high frequency asymptote slope be 40 db dec then the frequency spectrum of the closed loop system is equal to that of a second order inertia system with the maximum singular value 1 in contrast to the typical second order oscillation component the damping ratio is set to one ensuring no peak value in the frequency spectrum of t then 8 1 t 1 s 1 2 g ψ δ k 1 g ψ δ k k 1 2 g ψ δ t 1 s t 1 2 1 substituting nomoto model into 8 equation 9 can be obtained 9 k s 1 k 0 t 1 t 0 k 0 t 1 s 1 t 1 s 2 note that nomoto model itself contains an integrator static error caused by interference at the output end can be eliminated however for the interference at the input end the influence on static error exists in order to introduce the integral term to equation 9 a very small constant is added to the denominator of the nomoto model then the modified nomoto model can be expressed as g ψ δ k 0 t 0 s 2 s ε bring it into equation 8 there is 10 k s 1 k 0 t 1 t 0 k 0 t 1 s ε k 0 t 1 s 1 t 1 s 2 in actual application it is found that the controlled plant with large inertia such as ship has a large settling time zhang and guan 2010 added a positive constant ρ to the proportional part of the pid controller significantly speeding up the response without changing the steady state of the system based on the same methodology the final control law can be updated to equation 11 by adding a positive constant to the proportional part of the pid component in 10 11 k s 1 k 0 t 1 ρ t 0 k 0 t 1 s ε k 0 t 1 s 1 t 1 s 2 remark 1 the linear control law 11 is a typical pid controller in series with a first order filter which is concise in form and easy to be implemented in engineering the high frequency asymptotic slope of its spectrum is 40db dec which ensures strong robustness to high frequency noise at the input end the introduction of a first order filter further reduces the impact of high frequency noise avoiding the high frequency and large magnitude controller output which will reduce the energy consumption min et al 2020 used the nyquist criterion to prove the stability of the controller equation 9 the stability of equation 10 can be proved by the same method which will not be given here 3 2 fuzzy logic based integral coefficient adjustment in the above design ε in equation 11 is set to a constant as a result the integral coefficient of the pid part is also a constant using a constant integral coefficient has two main deficiencies a relatively large integral coefficient may lead to a large oscillation or overshoot when the integral coefficient is too small the static error may not be completely eliminated within a finite time on account of above analysis the fuzzy logic system is introduced to adjust ε according to the value of the course error and its changing rate online to further enhance the dynamic and static performance of the course keeping system set both the value range of input and output to 6 6 the quantization factor of output is set to 0 01 and the membership function is triangular membership function the main considerations of fuzzy rules are 1 when the error and its changing rate are large the integral coefficient is reduced to avoid excessive overshoot 2 when the error and its changing rate are small the integral coefficient is increased to eliminate the static error the fuzzy rule is shown in fig 2 where e stands for course error and ec stands for error s changing rate supposed the adjusted small constant is ε f u z z y then the integral coefficient adjusted by fuzzy rules is k i ε f u z z y k 0 t 1 remark 2 compared with the fuzzy pid the technique employed in this section has two advantages 1 the initial parameters of the fuzzy pid needs a complex process to tune while in this paper they are designed directly by the second order closed loop gain shaping algorithm ensuring the robustness of the controller 2 fuzzy pid adjusts all three parameters online while the proposed scheme only adjusts the integral coefficient meanwhile the fuzzy rules are designed according to the function of the integral term therefore the design process and controller structure are further simplified 3 3 nonlinear feedback improvement driven by sine function in order to further reduce the controller output and save energy the nonlinear feedback technique proposed by zhang and zhang 2016 is used to replace the original error signal by the error signal decorated by the sine function the structure of the nonlinear course keeping system is shown in fig 3 expand sin ω e by taylor series and keep it to the first order the result is sin ω e ω e where ω 1 is the nonlinear feedback parameter according to this equation the impact of nonlinear feedback technique on the closed loop system can be briefly analyzed from the following aspects 1 impact on the stability of the closed loop system it can be seen that when the error value is small the nonlinear feedback part is equivalent to a proportional part only reducing the open loop gain of the system for a minimum phase system reducing its open loop gain will increase the magnitude margin so nonlinear feedback has no additional effect on the stability of the closed loop system 2 the transfer function of the closed loop system is 12 y r g ψ δ k ω 1 g ψ δ k ω when ω 1 according to the closed loop gain shaping theory the transfer function satisfies the requirements of robust performance in the low frequency zone and robust stability in the high frequency zone therefore compared with the standard feedback system in the low frequency range the addition of ω in 12 has little influence on the dynamic performance of the system 3 impact on the output of the controller according to zhang and zhang 2010 the nonlinear feedback technique driven by sine function would reduce the changing frequency of the controller input thereby reducing the steering frequency the effective energy required by the controller to correct the same course deviation is certain the excessive high steering frequency will cause part of the energy to cancel the reduction of the steering frequency will improve the situation to some extent so as to finally reduce the rudder angle 4 a multi technique improved los guidance law in navigation practice the target track is obtained by directly connecting the waypoints with straight lines when there is an appropriate distance from the ship to the next waypoint the helmsman steers the ship to turn in advance to track next track section according to practical considerations this paper makes three improvements to the conventional los guidance with an advance turning strategy to improve the dynamic and static performance of track keeping system the rational and related notes of conventional los guidance are shown in fig 4 when the ship navigates at any position suppose the direction of the target track section is known the track error can be calculated by coordinate transformation as 13 y e sin α k x x k cos α k y y k from that the lookahead distance based los angle can be expressed as equation 14 14 ψ los α k arctan y e δ where δ is the lookahead distance which is usually taken as 3 5 times the length of the ship when the ship sails along the track it is necessary to determine whether to steer in advance to track next track section in conventional los guidance equation 15 is generally used as the criterion 15 x x k 1 2 y y k 1 2 r 2 that is when the distance between the ship and the next waypoint is less than the given distance r the autopilot starts to steer the advance turning distance r is consistent with the radius of circle of acceptance mentioned in many existing literatures r is generally taken as 2 2 times the length of ship in order to solve the problems that los guidance cannot eliminate the static track error under the interference of wind and current and the unsatisfactory transient performance due to the constant lookahead distance and advance turning distance the following three techniques are used to propose a multi technique improved los guidance 4 1 design of nonlinear sideslip angle observer for the sake of eliminating the static track error a nonlinear sideslip angle observer is constructed the main idea of this observer is to treat the unknown part of the derivation of the track error as a disturbance therefore the nonlinear sideslip angle observer is actually designed based on the methodology of an ndo nonlinear disturbance observer differentiating equation 13 the track error dynamics can be obtained as 16 y e u sin ψ β α k where u is ship s consultant speed and β is the sideslip angle since the sideslip angle is usually small there is sin β β and cos β 1 thus equation 16 become 17 y e u sin ψ α k u cos ψ α k β suppose g u cos ψ α k β from equation 17 it can be seen that as long as an observer is designed to estimate g the estimated value of sideslip angle can also be obtained as equation 18 18 β ˆ g ˆ u cos ψ α k assumption 1 there is an upper bound of g satisfying g g m a linear observer equation 19 is first given as 19 g ˆ k g g ˆ k g ˆ k y e u sin ψ α k linear observer equation 19 requires a known derivative of the track error which is difficult to obtain in practice therefore the auxiliary variable p is defined and the nonlinear observer equation 20 is constructed 20 g ˆ p k y e p k p k u sin ψ α k k y e differentiating g ˆ there is 21 g ˆ p k y e k g k p k y e k g select candidate lyapunov function v 1 1 2 g 2 taking the time derivative of it results in 22 v 1 g g g ˆ k g 2 g g using young s inequality there is g g a 1 g 2 g m 2 4 a 1 and equation 22 can be rewrite as v 1 k a 1 g 2 g m 2 4 a 1 assumption 2 the reference course angle signal can be tracked perfectly taking into account the sideslip angle equation 14 is further rewritten as 23 23 ψ los α k arctan y e δ β ˆ under the assumption 2 the derivative of the track error can be simplified to 24 y e u sin arctan y e δ β ˆ g y e δ β ˆ δ 2 y e δ β ˆ 2 g k 1 y e g where k 1 1 δ 2 y e δ β ˆ 2 considering the entire error system select the candidate lyapunov function v 2 v 1 1 2 y e 2 and derivate it to obtain equation 25 25 v 2 k a 1 g 2 g m 2 4 a 1 k 1 y e 2 y e g using young s inequality there is g y e a 2 g 2 y e 2 4 a 2 such that 26 v 2 k a 1 a 2 g 2 k 1 1 4 a 2 y e 2 g m 2 4 a 1 then there is v 2 μ v 2 d where d g m 2 4 a 1 μ 2 min k a 1 a 2 k 1 1 4 a 2 0 such that we have 27 0 v 2 d μ v 2 0 d μ e μ t all error signals are ultimately bounded by adjusting the parameters the sideslip angle estimation error and track error can be arbitrarily small the proposed nonlinear sideslip angle observer is designed for any track section from g ˆ p k y e it can be seen that after the ship turn in advance to track next section the output of the observer increases as the track error increases instantly after that the auxiliary variable p changes accordingly the observer start to re estimates the sideslip angle so the action of switching track section will not affect entire system s stability however the increase of the observer output will cause the milos angle given by equation 23 to increase instantaneously moreover it will maintain a larger value during the transient process which will saturate the actuator and cause the ship to have a large flare between the track sections to solve this problem the following improvement strategies are put forward for the value of β ˆ suppose the ship has tracked the target track section well before time t and the estimated sideslip angle is recorded as β ˆ t β 0 the ship starts to turn in advance after time t then for any time t k the value of the estimated sideslip angle is determined according to equation 28 28 β ˆ t k β 0 g ˆ t k g ˆ t k 1 0 01 h g ˆ t k u cos ψ α k g ˆ t k g ˆ t k 1 0 01 h where g ˆ t k and g ˆ t k 1 are the estimated values of g at the current sample time and the previous sample time respectively h is the sampling period from equation 28 the time that the estimated value of g changes greatly corresponds to the transient process at this time the value of the observer s auxiliary state p continues to update according to equation 20 but the sideslip angle calculated by equation 18 is not used while β 0 is used instead to avoid the peak value phenomenon when the changing rate of g ˆ is small the value of sideslip angle calculated by equation 18 has been much close to the true value using it as the observer output will not cause a sudden large change of β ˆ remark 3 the sideslip angle observer constructed based on the idea of ndo is similar to the reduced order eso based observer in liu et al 2017b but the observer in this paper is designed in the frame of conventional los while the eso based observer is designed in the parameterized los frame in addition the improvement strategy equation 28 enhances the feasibility of the observer when the advance turning action is included 4 2 a time varying lookahead distance in conventional los guidance the lookahead distance is set to 3 5 times the length of the ship it can be concluded from equation 14 that the reciprocal of the lookahead distance is equivalent to a proportional coefficient to the track error analogy with the idea of fuzzy pid if it can be updated by the value of the error the transient performance will be improved this paper uses the time varying lookahead distance proposed by lekkas and fossen 2012 29 δ y e δ max δ min e γ y e 2 δ min δ max and δ min are the maximum and minimum lookahead distance from equation 29 when the error is large the lookahead distance is small which will increase the proportional coefficient to speed up the track error s convergence when the error is small the lookahead distance is large and the proportional coefficient is reduced to prevent ship s position oscillating on both sides of the target track 4 3 a new advance turning distance setting strategy conventional los guidance requires the ship to turn in advance at a fixed distance from the waypoint such as 2 2 times the length of ship for small angles of turning this strategy is acceptable however in the case of a large angles an insufficient advance steering distance will cause the ship to deviate from the track by a large distance at the turning point after simulation experiments this paper proposes a new advance turning distance setting strategy equation 30 related to turning angle and ship s length 30 r 3 θ t u r n 1 5 l p p where θ t u r n and l p p are turning angle and ship s length other two coefficients are adjusted via a large number of matlab simulations through the new advance turning distance when the turning angle is large a sufficient steering distance can be reserved 5 simulation experiment 5 1 course keeping control for verifying the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed control algorithm the nonlinear nomoto model of the training ship yukun is selected as the simulation object the fuzzy control and the first order closed loop gain shaping controller the pd part of equation 9 are used as references to carry out the course keeping control experiment as for the parameter of the proposed controller ρ is 5 the initial value of ε is 0 and ω is 0 6 the relevant parameters of the training ship yukun are shown in table 1 based on that the parameter of nonlinear nomoto model can be calculated as k 0 0 31 s 1 t 0 64 53 s α 8 00 β 4295 02 to make the simulation more consistent with the navigation practice the characteristics of the steering servo system including the rudder angle saturation limit steering speed limit and an integral component are considered the maximum rudder angle δ max is 35 and the maximum steering speed is 2 7 s zhang and jin 2013 thomsen et al 2014 as for the environmental interference the equivalent wind rudder angle δ w 2 the wave interference is expressed by equation 5 set the initial course to 0 the target course to 60 and the simulation time to 500s the simulation results of the course keeping control effect and steering condition of fuzzy controller robust pd controller and the proposed controller are shown in fig 5 and the quantitative analysis results are shown in table 2 in terms of the control effect it can be seen from fig 5 a that fuzzy control and robust pd control cannot eliminate the static error caused by wind interference due to the lack of error integral term in principle while the proposed controller can track the target course without static error at the same time the maximum course deviation of the proposed controller is less than 1 which indicates its strong robustness regarding the steering situation it can be seen from fig 5 b that the rudder angle magnitude of the proposed controller is significantly smaller and the steering frequency is lower while the other two algorithms frequently use large rudder angles which not only means more energy consumption and wear to steering gear but also may cause the ship to roll significantly in heavy sea conditions posing a threat to navigation safety in order to compare the control effect quantitatively the three indicators zhang et al 2018 shown in equation 31 are introduced for analysis 31 mae 1 t t 0 t 0 t ψ r ψ t d t mia 1 t t 0 t 0 t δ t d t mtv 1 t t 0 t 0 t δ t δ t 1 d t mae mean absolute error is used to evaluate the response of the system while the mia mean integrate absolute and mtv mean total variation values of the control input are used to measure the energy consumption and smoothness of the control algorithm it can be concluded from the data in the table that the settling time of fuzzy control is much longer than that of the other two control algorithms its slower response speed also leads to greater errors accumulation in the rising period resulting in excessive mae values the mae value of the proposed controller is the smallest which reflects a better anti interference ability in terms of the average rudder angle and mia value the robust pd control has the largest rudder angle magnitude compared with fuzzy control and robust pd control the average rudder angle and mia value of the proposed controller are reduced by 3 and 28 respectively reflecting a good energy saving effect through observing the curve it can be found that compared with the proposed controller the maximum rudder angle maintain time of fuzzy control is shorter and the actuator saturation is smaller so its average rudder angle and mia value is not much larger but its rudder angle magnitude is obviously larger during course keeping period in a word though less energy is needed by the fuzzy control when the ship is turning her course larger rudder angle will be given to keep the course under the influence of environment disturbance overall speaking the energy saving effect of the proposed controller is still over the fuzzy control at the same time the mtv value is reduced by 34 6 than the other two algorithms indicating the steering frequency is significantly reduced additionally to better illustrate the superiority of the fuzzy logic based integrate coefficient technique a comparison experiment between the proposed controller with fuzzy adjusted integrate coefficient constant integrate coefficient ε 0 15 and without integrate terms are conducted the simulation results are shown in fig 5 c from the results we can know that the controller without the integral term cannot eliminate the static error while the controller with constant integral coefficient will cause a large overshoot which is unacceptable in practice the fuzzy adjusted coefficient based controller can eliminate the static error within a finite time while the overshoot is only two degrees indicating a good transient performance to sum up with regard to the static performance the proposed controller can eliminate the course error within a finite time in terms of dynamic performance it has a short settling time and can avoid the large overshoot caused by a constant integrate coefficient furthermore the reasonable steering condition makes it more consistent with the requirement of navigation practice which can effectively save energy and ensure safe navigation remark 4 in this paper the maximum steering speed is 2 7 s which is smaller than that in most research about ship s course keeping issue such as zhang et al 2018 and min et al 2020 this setting is more consistent with the condition of the steering gear equipped in the real merchant ship meanwhile it is a big challenge to the robustness of the control algorithm in both the course keeping and track keeping scenario because the performance of the actuator is limited from the simulation it is noticeable that the control effect of the proposed controller is remarkable over the other two controllers from another aspect the limited steering speed lead to smaller rudder angle and steering frequency which is helpful to reduce energy consumption and the wear of the actuator it is reasonable to conclude that if the performance of the actuator is improved the control effect of the proposed controller will be better and its energy saving ability can also be better illustrated 5 2 track keeping control 5 2 1 single section track keeping control to begin with a single section track with only two waypoints is selected to conduct the track keeping experiment the coordinates of the two waypoints in the geodetic coordinate system are 0m 0m and 8000m 8000m respectively the initial position of the ship is 500m 500m and the initial course angle is 0 the longitudinal velocity u of the ship is 8 8 m s 17 kn and the lateral velocity is set to 0 0001 m s the wind and wave interference remains unchanged the current velocity is 2 kn and the direction is 90 the proposed controller is used for course keeping control the guidance algorithm is milos guidance and conventional los guidance respectively in milos guidance k is 2 the value of p 0 is set to k y e 0 δ max and δ min are five times and three times the ship s length respectively and γ is 1 2 the track keeping effect track error sideslip angle observer output and steering condition are shown in fig 6 from the partial enlarged view of fig 6 a and b the position of the ship under the milos guidance can converge to the target track at a faster speed due to the lookahead distance that changes with the track error for los guidance there is a static error of about 25m between the actual track and the target track while the proposed nonlinear sideslip angle observer can estimate the true value of the sideslip angle with final estimation error around 0 05 what s more it avoids the bad transient process of alos the reduced stability margin of ilos liu 2018 using the estimated value of the sideslip angle provided by the observer the milos guidance makes track error finally converge to zero the steering condition shown in fig 6 d shows that when the error is large the milos guidance uses a larger rudder angle to quickly reduce the track error but it does not cause the actuator to saturate for a long time when the track error is relatively small the lookahead distance increases to avoid large controller output thus the rudder angle is slightly smaller than los guidance in summary the proposed milos guidance can estimate the sideslip angle so that the ship can still accurately track the desired track under the interference of wind and current which indicates a good static performance the track error based time varying lookahead distance speeded up the converge of track error which is an improvement to the dynamic performance meanwhile the steering condition is still reasonable avoiding additional energy consumption 5 2 2 multi section track keeping control a multi section track composed of multiple waypoints is set up for verifying the effect of proposed strategy when the advance turning action is considered the coordinates of the seven waypoints in the geodetic coordinate system are 0m 0m 3075m 769m 4615m 7693m 4615m 23227m 3077m 30000m 0m 13846m in last section the ship s lateral speed v is set to a relatively small constant which is acceptable when the ship is sailing in a straight line actually due to the coupling of sway motion and yaw motion the lateral speed of the ship will become relatively large when the ship is turning her course which will cause the sideslip angle to increase instantly in order to make the simulation more consistent with the actual situation the simulation object is replaced by the nonlinear norrbin model the track keeping effect track error sideslip angle observer output and steering condition are shown in fig 7 it can be seen from the partial enlarged part of fig 7 a that when the track error is large milos can guide the ship to approach the target track more quickly at each turning point milos can make the ship smoothly turn to track next section due to the time varying lookahead distance the rudder angle can be reduced to prevent overshoot when the track error is rather small because of using a fixed lookahead distance the position of the ship under los guidance oscillate on both sides of the target track the angle of turning at the sixth waypoint is relatively large the los guidance uses a fixed advance turning distance which causes the ship to have a large flare and oscillation between track sections with the biggest track error around 300m while milos uses the advance turning distance related to the angle of turning guiding the ship to turn approximately along the inscribed circle which is more in line with the requirements of navigation practice in terms of track error it can be seen from fig 7 b that los guidance cannot eliminate the static error caused by wind and current interference the sideslip angle observer of milos can effectively estimate the true value with the final estimation error around 0 2 from 2255 to 2260 s it can be known that the improved strategy equation 28 keeps the estimated value unchanged when its changing rate is large avoiding the sudden large increase caused by switching track section to the greatest extent thus avoiding actuator saturation using the estimated sideslip angle milos makes the track error finally converge to zero fig 7 d shows that the steering conditions of the two guidance methods are both reasonable the rudder angle magnitude and steering frequency of milos are slightly lower indicating less energy consumption in summary under the environment disturbance and limited actuator performance the proposed milos guidance can track the target path without any static track error which indicates its better static performance the smoother turning around each waypoint proved that it has obvious advantage in dynamic performance besides the steering condition under milos guidance is still reasonable which ensures its engineering availability remark 5 it can be seen from fig 7 c that due to the excessively large angle of turning at waypoint 6 the sideslip angle value is positive at first and then turns to negative when the positive sideslip angle appears the observer output is not yet stable therefore the estimated value of the sideslip angle remains unchanged according to equation 28 resulting that the true value cannot be estimated well however because the indirect track keeping control strategy only requires the ship to turn smoothly at the waypoint which means the accurate tracking of its nearby two sections is not necessary the estimation error of the sideslip angle will not affect the overall track keeping effect 6 conclusion this paper proposes an indirect nonlinear feedback concise robust track keeping control strategy based on navigation practice using the second order closed loop gain shaping algorithm fuzzy logic system and nonlinear feedback technique a course keeping controller with good robustness and energy saving effect is designed for the guidance system based on the nonlinear sideslip angle observer the time varying lookahead distance and a new advance turning distance related to the angle of turning the milos guidance law that meets the requirements of navigation practice and has excellent dynamic and static performance is proposed the effectiveness of the proposed scheme is verified by simulation experiments under various conditions and the results show that its comprehensive advantages are obvious which is of great significance

20979,in order to solve the problem that the parameterized los line of sight guidance cannot be directly applied to the navigation practice this paper proposed an indirect nonlinear feedback concise robust track keeping control strategy for ships which consists of a robust course keeping controller and a milos multi technique improved los guidance system the second order closed loop gain shaping algorithm was employed to design the linear course keeping controller then the fuzzy logic system was used to adjust the integral coefficient online to improve the transient performance the introduction of nonlinear feedback technique further reduces the steering frequency and saves energy for the guidance system three techniques are introduced to enhance the track keeping effect a nonlinear sideslip angle observer is developed to eliminate the static track error caused by the wind and current interference a time varying lookahead distance and a new advance turning distance are proposed to achieve the smooth turning between track sections simulation results show that compared with the conventional los guidance the proposed strategy is more consistent with the requirement of navigation practice and has comprehensive advantages in both dynamic and static performance which is of great significance for enhancing the ability of ship s autonomous navigation keywords track keeping closed loop gain shaping nonlinear feedback milos guidance 1 introduction track keeping control is an important research direction in the ship motion control field especially for long distance navigation the automatic control can reduce the labor intensity of seaman and improve the operation efficiency which can increase the safety of navigation therefore it is of great importance to design a track keeping controller with good control performance low steering frequency and strong robustness fossen 2011 do 2010 zhang and zhang 2013 with the prosperity of control theory various advanced control strategies have been applied to the design of ship s track keeping controller track keeping control for ships can be divided into path following control and trajectory tracking control in this paper we emphasize on the path following control where the target track is time independent wen et al 2020 designed the ship path following controller based on the characteristic model which was convenient to adjust the controller structure as the navigation environment changes do 2016 used the backstepping method to design a robust adaptive path following controller deng et al 2019 designed a path following controller for a sail assisted ship fuzzy logic system was employed to optimize its speed the above results belong to the direct track keeping strategy that is the track error is used to directly drive the controller to give the rudder angle to make the ship to track target path the opposite method is the indirect track keeping strategy which divides the entire control system into a guidance system and a course keeping controller the guidance system uses the track error to generate reference course then the course keeping controller tracks the reference course making the track error converge to zero the indirect track keeping strategy is more consistent with the action of seafarers in practice it has a simple structure along with the feature of convenient for operator to switch between course keeping and track keeping modes the guidance system has a critical impact on the track keeping control effect fossen et al 2002 gao et al 2015 among the existing researches the parameterized los guidance is extensively used fossen et al 2014 serrano et al 2014 where the target track is expressed as the parametric equation of a variable the advantage of this method is that it is suitable for the tracking of curved path to construct the parametric track the following three methods are selected by most literatures in xia et al 2019 the desired sinusoidal track was directly given in the form of a parametric equation in lekkas 2014 each waypoint was first given then the cubic spline interpolation was used to construct the desired parametric track between the waypoints deng 2019 used straight lines and arcs to connect waypoints to form the parametric track which was equivalent to preset turning points and turning radius in the above three methods the curved path is introduced to the desired path to varying degrees the tracking of curved track is not so practical in navigation practice especially for some large tankers it is nearly impossible due to the large time delay characteristic in nautical practice seaman first set a few waypoints and connect them only with straight lines which is also called a waypoint based navigation mode when there is an appropriate distance from the ship to the next waypoint the helmsman steers the ship to turn in advance for parameterized los the way of setting target track is different from that in practice and the action of turning in advance is also not included therefore the conventional non parameterized los with an advance turning strategy is more in accord with the requirements of navigation practice the conventional los method with an advance turning strategy still has the following three problems to be solved 1 under the interference of wind and current the sideslip angle will cause a static track error due to the high cost of measuring the sideslip angle many solutions had been put forward borhaug et al 2008 added an error integral term to the los angle presenting the ilos guidance method fossen et al 2014 proposed alos guidance where an adaptive parameter was used to estimate the constant sideslip angle liu et al 2016 proposed plos guidance based on two predictors of track error which could reduce the oscillation during transient period liu et al 2017b used reduced order eso to estimate sideslip angle the above methods are all based on the parameterized los guidance to design the sideslip angle adaptive law or observer which cannot be directly used in the conventional los guidance with advance turning strategy 2 there are two methods for obtaining the lookahead distance which is an important parameter in los guidance the enclosure based scheme can achieve better transient performance but its calculation is complicated the method to set a constant lookahead distance is simple and feasible yet poorly adjusted parameters may cause slower convergence or make the ship s position oscillate on two sides of the target track the time varying lookahead distance developed by lekkas and fossen 2012 had the advantages of the above two methods which had been successfully used in parameterized los nevertheless it has not been applied in conventional los scheme 3 the conventional los guidance requires the ship to turn in advance at a distance of 2 2 times the ship s length from the waypoint khaled et al 2013 if the angle of turning the angle between the original track section and the new track section is relatively large the ship may deviate from the desired track by a long distance when turning therefore the setting of the advance turning distance also needs to be modified the solving of the first problem will improve the track keeping accuracy while the other two is related to the system s dynamic performance with respect to the course keeping controller the control law should have a concise form and fewer parameters ensuring that it can be understood well by engineers meanwhile it should possess good robustness to overcome parameter uncertainty model perturbation and external interference pid controller and fuzzy controller are two typical control strategies that meet the above requirements pid control has the characteristics of simplicity but its parameter tuning is rather complex tuning it by specific theory such as the closed loop gain shaping algorithm can ensure the control effect zhang et al 2018 zhao et al 2019 another problem of pid control is that the output energy is relatively large especially its differential part is sensitive to noise which may lead to high frequency and large magnitude rudder angle output in order to solve this problem zhang and zhang 2016 proposed the nonlinear feedback technique which replaces the original error with the error signal decorated by the nonlinear function to save energy fan et al 2018 applied nonlinear feedback technique to usv unmanned surface vessel successfully which proved its engineering availability fuzzy control is also widely used in course keeping controllers velagic 2003 omerdic 2003 which directly gives the controller output according to the error and its changing rate however due to its lack of integral terms in principle the static error cannot be eliminated under the effect of interference meanwhile the zero rudder angle cannot be stably given when the error is small causing additional energy consumption fuzzy pid technique uses human experienced based fuzzy rules to adjust three parameters online to improve the adaptability of pid control ding 2009 regarded the speed as a condition of fuzzy inference so that the fuzzy pid controller could adapt to task with different speeds cheng 2001 designed a multi mode fuzzy pid controller which could choose fuzzy p control or fuzzy pd control under different scenarios such as track keeping and turning the effect of fuzzy pid control is also highly related to the selection of initial parameters to guarantee good control effect they can be tuned based on the closed loop gain shaping algorithm as well inspired by the above results this paper proposes an indirect ship track keeping strategy that meets the requirements of navigation practice the contributions are mainly twofold 1 for the course keeping controller a pid controller with a first order filter is designed using the second order closed loop gain shaping algorithm the fuzzy logic system and nonlinear feedback technique are further introduced to improve transient performance and save energy 2 for the guidance system on the basis of conventional los guidance three techniques including a nonlinear sideslip angle observer a time varying lookahead distance and a new advance turning distance are introduced to propose a milos guidance which can enhance both dynamic and static performance 2 ship motion mathematical model 2 1 kinematic model according to jia and yang 1999 the plane kinematics equation of a three freedom ship model can be expressed as 1 x u cos ψ v sin ψ y u sin ψ v cos ψ ψ r 2 2 kinetics model 2 2 1 nonlinear nomoto model 2 ψ k 0 t 0 α ψ β ψ 3 k 0 t 0 δ where ψ is the heading angle δ is the rudder angle k 0 t 0 are ship s manoeuvrability indices α β are nonlinear parameters if the nonlinear term in the equation is ignored the classical linear nomoto model for controller design can be expressed as g ψ δ k 0 s t 0 s 1 in this paper the linear nomoto model is used for course keeping controller design which can ensure the control law has a lower order form while the nonlinear nomoto model is used in course keeping and single section track keeping control simulation experiment because of its rather good accuracy from the compared experiment in zhang et al 2018 the simulation results of nonlinear nomoto model was consistent at a high level with the real ship trail test data 2 2 2 nonlinear norrbin model 3 x 2 a 2 x 2 b 2 δ i 2 1 f non f wind f wave the basic form of the nonlinear norrbin model is shown in equation 3 which superimposes nonlinear hydrodynamics wind and wave forces on the basis of the basic linear model where x 2 v r t i 2 is the inertial force derivative matrix a 2 b 2 are linear equation coefficient matrices f non f wind and f wave are matrixes of nonlinear fluid force wind force and wave force respectively one can refer zhang and jin 2013 for specific expressions unlike nonlinear nomoto model both the dynamic of ship s yaw and sway motion can be reflected in it which is suitable for the simulation scenario where the changing of ship s course must be considered the nonlinear norrbin model 3 and equation 1 will be used in multi section track keeping simulation experiment 2 3 environmental interference model 1 for wind interference it can be divided into average wind and pulse wind the average wind can be converted into the wind equivalent rudder angle by using equation 4 and the pulse wind is simulated by the white noise kallstrom 1982 4 δ w k v w v l sin θ where v w is wind speed v l is ship speed and k is leeway coefficient 2 the wave disturbance can be treated equivalent to a simplified linear model which expressed as a typical second order oscillation system driven by a gaussian white noise the wave disturbance acts directly on the ship s course the models of wave disturbance recognized by ittc under the wind scale of beaufort no 6 is 5 ψ h 0 4198 s s 2 0 3638 s 0 3675 w h where w h s ψ h are gaussian white noise laplace operator and high frequency wave disturbance 3 for ocean current interference it is expressed by the change of ship speed the ship speed u v and the first two lines of equation 1 are modified as follows 6 u u r v c cos γ c ψ v v r v c sin γ c ψ 7 x u r cos ψ v r sin ψ v c cos γ c y u r sin ψ v r cos ψ v c sin γ c where u r and v r is the speed of the ship relative to the water v c is the current velocity and γ c is the current direction 3 course keeping controller design 3 1 linear robust controller design according to the principle of an indirect track keeping control system a course keeping controller is supposed to be employed to control the ship to track the reference course generated by the guidance system considering linear nomoto model g ψ δ k 0 s t 0 s 1 the linear robust course keeping controller can be designed through the second order closed loop gain shaping algorithm zhang 2012 the closed loop gain shaping algorithm is presented through the observation of the singular value curve of h control mixed sensitivity and the correlation between sensitivity function s and complementary sensitivity function t the typical s t singular value curve is shown in fig 1 in order to make the system robust and stable the closed loop spectrum of the system is required to be low pass and the maximum singular value is 1 to ensure that the reference signal is tracked with no steady state error set the bandwidth frequency of the closed loop system to 1 t 1 crossover frequency in the strict sense let the high frequency asymptote slope be 40 db dec then the frequency spectrum of the closed loop system is equal to that of a second order inertia system with the maximum singular value 1 in contrast to the typical second order oscillation component the damping ratio is set to one ensuring no peak value in the frequency spectrum of t then 8 1 t 1 s 1 2 g ψ δ k 1 g ψ δ k k 1 2 g ψ δ t 1 s t 1 2 1 substituting nomoto model into 8 equation 9 can be obtained 9 k s 1 k 0 t 1 t 0 k 0 t 1 s 1 t 1 s 2 note that nomoto model itself contains an integrator static error caused by interference at the output end can be eliminated however for the interference at the input end the influence on static error exists in order to introduce the integral term to equation 9 a very small constant is added to the denominator of the nomoto model then the modified nomoto model can be expressed as g ψ δ k 0 t 0 s 2 s ε bring it into equation 8 there is 10 k s 1 k 0 t 1 t 0 k 0 t 1 s ε k 0 t 1 s 1 t 1 s 2 in actual application it is found that the controlled plant with large inertia such as ship has a large settling time zhang and guan 2010 added a positive constant ρ to the proportional part of the pid controller significantly speeding up the response without changing the steady state of the system based on the same methodology the final control law can be updated to equation 11 by adding a positive constant to the proportional part of the pid component in 10 11 k s 1 k 0 t 1 ρ t 0 k 0 t 1 s ε k 0 t 1 s 1 t 1 s 2 remark 1 the linear control law 11 is a typical pid controller in series with a first order filter which is concise in form and easy to be implemented in engineering the high frequency asymptotic slope of its spectrum is 40db dec which ensures strong robustness to high frequency noise at the input end the introduction of a first order filter further reduces the impact of high frequency noise avoiding the high frequency and large magnitude controller output which will reduce the energy consumption min et al 2020 used the nyquist criterion to prove the stability of the controller equation 9 the stability of equation 10 can be proved by the same method which will not be given here 3 2 fuzzy logic based integral coefficient adjustment in the above design ε in equation 11 is set to a constant as a result the integral coefficient of the pid part is also a constant using a constant integral coefficient has two main deficiencies a relatively large integral coefficient may lead to a large oscillation or overshoot when the integral coefficient is too small the static error may not be completely eliminated within a finite time on account of above analysis the fuzzy logic system is introduced to adjust ε according to the value of the course error and its changing rate online to further enhance the dynamic and static performance of the course keeping system set both the value range of input and output to 6 6 the quantization factor of output is set to 0 01 and the membership function is triangular membership function the main considerations of fuzzy rules are 1 when the error and its changing rate are large the integral coefficient is reduced to avoid excessive overshoot 2 when the error and its changing rate are small the integral coefficient is increased to eliminate the static error the fuzzy rule is shown in fig 2 where e stands for course error and ec stands for error s changing rate supposed the adjusted small constant is ε f u z z y then the integral coefficient adjusted by fuzzy rules is k i ε f u z z y k 0 t 1 remark 2 compared with the fuzzy pid the technique employed in this section has two advantages 1 the initial parameters of the fuzzy pid needs a complex process to tune while in this paper they are designed directly by the second order closed loop gain shaping algorithm ensuring the robustness of the controller 2 fuzzy pid adjusts all three parameters online while the proposed scheme only adjusts the integral coefficient meanwhile the fuzzy rules are designed according to the function of the integral term therefore the design process and controller structure are further simplified 3 3 nonlinear feedback improvement driven by sine function in order to further reduce the controller output and save energy the nonlinear feedback technique proposed by zhang and zhang 2016 is used to replace the original error signal by the error signal decorated by the sine function the structure of the nonlinear course keeping system is shown in fig 3 expand sin ω e by taylor series and keep it to the first order the result is sin ω e ω e where ω 1 is the nonlinear feedback parameter according to this equation the impact of nonlinear feedback technique on the closed loop system can be briefly analyzed from the following aspects 1 impact on the stability of the closed loop system it can be seen that when the error value is small the nonlinear feedback part is equivalent to a proportional part only reducing the open loop gain of the system for a minimum phase system reducing its open loop gain will increase the magnitude margin so nonlinear feedback has no additional effect on the stability of the closed loop system 2 the transfer function of the closed loop system is 12 y r g ψ δ k ω 1 g ψ δ k ω when ω 1 according to the closed loop gain shaping theory the transfer function satisfies the requirements of robust performance in the low frequency zone and robust stability in the high frequency zone therefore compared with the standard feedback system in the low frequency range the addition of ω in 12 has little influence on the dynamic performance of the system 3 impact on the output of the controller according to zhang and zhang 2010 the nonlinear feedback technique driven by sine function would reduce the changing frequency of the controller input thereby reducing the steering frequency the effective energy required by the controller to correct the same course deviation is certain the excessive high steering frequency will cause part of the energy to cancel the reduction of the steering frequency will improve the situation to some extent so as to finally reduce the rudder angle 4 a multi technique improved los guidance law in navigation practice the target track is obtained by directly connecting the waypoints with straight lines when there is an appropriate distance from the ship to the next waypoint the helmsman steers the ship to turn in advance to track next track section according to practical considerations this paper makes three improvements to the conventional los guidance with an advance turning strategy to improve the dynamic and static performance of track keeping system the rational and related notes of conventional los guidance are shown in fig 4 when the ship navigates at any position suppose the direction of the target track section is known the track error can be calculated by coordinate transformation as 13 y e sin α k x x k cos α k y y k from that the lookahead distance based los angle can be expressed as equation 14 14 ψ los α k arctan y e δ where δ is the lookahead distance which is usually taken as 3 5 times the length of the ship when the ship sails along the track it is necessary to determine whether to steer in advance to track next track section in conventional los guidance equation 15 is generally used as the criterion 15 x x k 1 2 y y k 1 2 r 2 that is when the distance between the ship and the next waypoint is less than the given distance r the autopilot starts to steer the advance turning distance r is consistent with the radius of circle of acceptance mentioned in many existing literatures r is generally taken as 2 2 times the length of ship in order to solve the problems that los guidance cannot eliminate the static track error under the interference of wind and current and the unsatisfactory transient performance due to the constant lookahead distance and advance turning distance the following three techniques are used to propose a multi technique improved los guidance 4 1 design of nonlinear sideslip angle observer for the sake of eliminating the static track error a nonlinear sideslip angle observer is constructed the main idea of this observer is to treat the unknown part of the derivation of the track error as a disturbance therefore the nonlinear sideslip angle observer is actually designed based on the methodology of an ndo nonlinear disturbance observer differentiating equation 13 the track error dynamics can be obtained as 16 y e u sin ψ β α k where u is ship s consultant speed and β is the sideslip angle since the sideslip angle is usually small there is sin β β and cos β 1 thus equation 16 become 17 y e u sin ψ α k u cos ψ α k β suppose g u cos ψ α k β from equation 17 it can be seen that as long as an observer is designed to estimate g the estimated value of sideslip angle can also be obtained as equation 18 18 β ˆ g ˆ u cos ψ α k assumption 1 there is an upper bound of g satisfying g g m a linear observer equation 19 is first given as 19 g ˆ k g g ˆ k g ˆ k y e u sin ψ α k linear observer equation 19 requires a known derivative of the track error which is difficult to obtain in practice therefore the auxiliary variable p is defined and the nonlinear observer equation 20 is constructed 20 g ˆ p k y e p k p k u sin ψ α k k y e differentiating g ˆ there is 21 g ˆ p k y e k g k p k y e k g select candidate lyapunov function v 1 1 2 g 2 taking the time derivative of it results in 22 v 1 g g g ˆ k g 2 g g using young s inequality there is g g a 1 g 2 g m 2 4 a 1 and equation 22 can be rewrite as v 1 k a 1 g 2 g m 2 4 a 1 assumption 2 the reference course angle signal can be tracked perfectly taking into account the sideslip angle equation 14 is further rewritten as 23 23 ψ los α k arctan y e δ β ˆ under the assumption 2 the derivative of the track error can be simplified to 24 y e u sin arctan y e δ β ˆ g y e δ β ˆ δ 2 y e δ β ˆ 2 g k 1 y e g where k 1 1 δ 2 y e δ β ˆ 2 considering the entire error system select the candidate lyapunov function v 2 v 1 1 2 y e 2 and derivate it to obtain equation 25 25 v 2 k a 1 g 2 g m 2 4 a 1 k 1 y e 2 y e g using young s inequality there is g y e a 2 g 2 y e 2 4 a 2 such that 26 v 2 k a 1 a 2 g 2 k 1 1 4 a 2 y e 2 g m 2 4 a 1 then there is v 2 μ v 2 d where d g m 2 4 a 1 μ 2 min k a 1 a 2 k 1 1 4 a 2 0 such that we have 27 0 v 2 d μ v 2 0 d μ e μ t all error signals are ultimately bounded by adjusting the parameters the sideslip angle estimation error and track error can be arbitrarily small the proposed nonlinear sideslip angle observer is designed for any track section from g ˆ p k y e it can be seen that after the ship turn in advance to track next section the output of the observer increases as the track error increases instantly after that the auxiliary variable p changes accordingly the observer start to re estimates the sideslip angle so the action of switching track section will not affect entire system s stability however the increase of the observer output will cause the milos angle given by equation 23 to increase instantaneously moreover it will maintain a larger value during the transient process which will saturate the actuator and cause the ship to have a large flare between the track sections to solve this problem the following improvement strategies are put forward for the value of β ˆ suppose the ship has tracked the target track section well before time t and the estimated sideslip angle is recorded as β ˆ t β 0 the ship starts to turn in advance after time t then for any time t k the value of the estimated sideslip angle is determined according to equation 28 28 β ˆ t k β 0 g ˆ t k g ˆ t k 1 0 01 h g ˆ t k u cos ψ α k g ˆ t k g ˆ t k 1 0 01 h where g ˆ t k and g ˆ t k 1 are the estimated values of g at the current sample time and the previous sample time respectively h is the sampling period from equation 28 the time that the estimated value of g changes greatly corresponds to the transient process at this time the value of the observer s auxiliary state p continues to update according to equation 20 but the sideslip angle calculated by equation 18 is not used while β 0 is used instead to avoid the peak value phenomenon when the changing rate of g ˆ is small the value of sideslip angle calculated by equation 18 has been much close to the true value using it as the observer output will not cause a sudden large change of β ˆ remark 3 the sideslip angle observer constructed based on the idea of ndo is similar to the reduced order eso based observer in liu et al 2017b but the observer in this paper is designed in the frame of conventional los while the eso based observer is designed in the parameterized los frame in addition the improvement strategy equation 28 enhances the feasibility of the observer when the advance turning action is included 4 2 a time varying lookahead distance in conventional los guidance the lookahead distance is set to 3 5 times the length of the ship it can be concluded from equation 14 that the reciprocal of the lookahead distance is equivalent to a proportional coefficient to the track error analogy with the idea of fuzzy pid if it can be updated by the value of the error the transient performance will be improved this paper uses the time varying lookahead distance proposed by lekkas and fossen 2012 29 δ y e δ max δ min e γ y e 2 δ min δ max and δ min are the maximum and minimum lookahead distance from equation 29 when the error is large the lookahead distance is small which will increase the proportional coefficient to speed up the track error s convergence when the error is small the lookahead distance is large and the proportional coefficient is reduced to prevent ship s position oscillating on both sides of the target track 4 3 a new advance turning distance setting strategy conventional los guidance requires the ship to turn in advance at a fixed distance from the waypoint such as 2 2 times the length of ship for small angles of turning this strategy is acceptable however in the case of a large angles an insufficient advance steering distance will cause the ship to deviate from the track by a large distance at the turning point after simulation experiments this paper proposes a new advance turning distance setting strategy equation 30 related to turning angle and ship s length 30 r 3 θ t u r n 1 5 l p p where θ t u r n and l p p are turning angle and ship s length other two coefficients are adjusted via a large number of matlab simulations through the new advance turning distance when the turning angle is large a sufficient steering distance can be reserved 5 simulation experiment 5 1 course keeping control for verifying the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed control algorithm the nonlinear nomoto model of the training ship yukun is selected as the simulation object the fuzzy control and the first order closed loop gain shaping controller the pd part of equation 9 are used as references to carry out the course keeping control experiment as for the parameter of the proposed controller ρ is 5 the initial value of ε is 0 and ω is 0 6 the relevant parameters of the training ship yukun are shown in table 1 based on that the parameter of nonlinear nomoto model can be calculated as k 0 0 31 s 1 t 0 64 53 s α 8 00 β 4295 02 to make the simulation more consistent with the navigation practice the characteristics of the steering servo system including the rudder angle saturation limit steering speed limit and an integral component are considered the maximum rudder angle δ max is 35 and the maximum steering speed is 2 7 s zhang and jin 2013 thomsen et al 2014 as for the environmental interference the equivalent wind rudder angle δ w 2 the wave interference is expressed by equation 5 set the initial course to 0 the target course to 60 and the simulation time to 500s the simulation results of the course keeping control effect and steering condition of fuzzy controller robust pd controller and the proposed controller are shown in fig 5 and the quantitative analysis results are shown in table 2 in terms of the control effect it can be seen from fig 5 a that fuzzy control and robust pd control cannot eliminate the static error caused by wind interference due to the lack of error integral term in principle while the proposed controller can track the target course without static error at the same time the maximum course deviation of the proposed controller is less than 1 which indicates its strong robustness regarding the steering situation it can be seen from fig 5 b that the rudder angle magnitude of the proposed controller is significantly smaller and the steering frequency is lower while the other two algorithms frequently use large rudder angles which not only means more energy consumption and wear to steering gear but also may cause the ship to roll significantly in heavy sea conditions posing a threat to navigation safety in order to compare the control effect quantitatively the three indicators zhang et al 2018 shown in equation 31 are introduced for analysis 31 mae 1 t t 0 t 0 t ψ r ψ t d t mia 1 t t 0 t 0 t δ t d t mtv 1 t t 0 t 0 t δ t δ t 1 d t mae mean absolute error is used to evaluate the response of the system while the mia mean integrate absolute and mtv mean total variation values of the control input are used to measure the energy consumption and smoothness of the control algorithm it can be concluded from the data in the table that the settling time of fuzzy control is much longer than that of the other two control algorithms its slower response speed also leads to greater errors accumulation in the rising period resulting in excessive mae values the mae value of the proposed controller is the smallest which reflects a better anti interference ability in terms of the average rudder angle and mia value the robust pd control has the largest rudder angle magnitude compared with fuzzy control and robust pd control the average rudder angle and mia value of the proposed controller are reduced by 3 and 28 respectively reflecting a good energy saving effect through observing the curve it can be found that compared with the proposed controller the maximum rudder angle maintain time of fuzzy control is shorter and the actuator saturation is smaller so its average rudder angle and mia value is not much larger but its rudder angle magnitude is obviously larger during course keeping period in a word though less energy is needed by the fuzzy control when the ship is turning her course larger rudder angle will be given to keep the course under the influence of environment disturbance overall speaking the energy saving effect of the proposed controller is still over the fuzzy control at the same time the mtv value is reduced by 34 6 than the other two algorithms indicating the steering frequency is significantly reduced additionally to better illustrate the superiority of the fuzzy logic based integrate coefficient technique a comparison experiment between the proposed controller with fuzzy adjusted integrate coefficient constant integrate coefficient ε 0 15 and without integrate terms are conducted the simulation results are shown in fig 5 c from the results we can know that the controller without the integral term cannot eliminate the static error while the controller with constant integral coefficient will cause a large overshoot which is unacceptable in practice the fuzzy adjusted coefficient based controller can eliminate the static error within a finite time while the overshoot is only two degrees indicating a good transient performance to sum up with regard to the static performance the proposed controller can eliminate the course error within a finite time in terms of dynamic performance it has a short settling time and can avoid the large overshoot caused by a constant integrate coefficient furthermore the reasonable steering condition makes it more consistent with the requirement of navigation practice which can effectively save energy and ensure safe navigation remark 4 in this paper the maximum steering speed is 2 7 s which is smaller than that in most research about ship s course keeping issue such as zhang et al 2018 and min et al 2020 this setting is more consistent with the condition of the steering gear equipped in the real merchant ship meanwhile it is a big challenge to the robustness of the control algorithm in both the course keeping and track keeping scenario because the performance of the actuator is limited from the simulation it is noticeable that the control effect of the proposed controller is remarkable over the other two controllers from another aspect the limited steering speed lead to smaller rudder angle and steering frequency which is helpful to reduce energy consumption and the wear of the actuator it is reasonable to conclude that if the performance of the actuator is improved the control effect of the proposed controller will be better and its energy saving ability can also be better illustrated 5 2 track keeping control 5 2 1 single section track keeping control to begin with a single section track with only two waypoints is selected to conduct the track keeping experiment the coordinates of the two waypoints in the geodetic coordinate system are 0m 0m and 8000m 8000m respectively the initial position of the ship is 500m 500m and the initial course angle is 0 the longitudinal velocity u of the ship is 8 8 m s 17 kn and the lateral velocity is set to 0 0001 m s the wind and wave interference remains unchanged the current velocity is 2 kn and the direction is 90 the proposed controller is used for course keeping control the guidance algorithm is milos guidance and conventional los guidance respectively in milos guidance k is 2 the value of p 0 is set to k y e 0 δ max and δ min are five times and three times the ship s length respectively and γ is 1 2 the track keeping effect track error sideslip angle observer output and steering condition are shown in fig 6 from the partial enlarged view of fig 6 a and b the position of the ship under the milos guidance can converge to the target track at a faster speed due to the lookahead distance that changes with the track error for los guidance there is a static error of about 25m between the actual track and the target track while the proposed nonlinear sideslip angle observer can estimate the true value of the sideslip angle with final estimation error around 0 05 what s more it avoids the bad transient process of alos the reduced stability margin of ilos liu 2018 using the estimated value of the sideslip angle provided by the observer the milos guidance makes track error finally converge to zero the steering condition shown in fig 6 d shows that when the error is large the milos guidance uses a larger rudder angle to quickly reduce the track error but it does not cause the actuator to saturate for a long time when the track error is relatively small the lookahead distance increases to avoid large controller output thus the rudder angle is slightly smaller than los guidance in summary the proposed milos guidance can estimate the sideslip angle so that the ship can still accurately track the desired track under the interference of wind and current which indicates a good static performance the track error based time varying lookahead distance speeded up the converge of track error which is an improvement to the dynamic performance meanwhile the steering condition is still reasonable avoiding additional energy consumption 5 2 2 multi section track keeping control a multi section track composed of multiple waypoints is set up for verifying the effect of proposed strategy when the advance turning action is considered the coordinates of the seven waypoints in the geodetic coordinate system are 0m 0m 3075m 769m 4615m 7693m 4615m 23227m 3077m 30000m 0m 13846m in last section the ship s lateral speed v is set to a relatively small constant which is acceptable when the ship is sailing in a straight line actually due to the coupling of sway motion and yaw motion the lateral speed of the ship will become relatively large when the ship is turning her course which will cause the sideslip angle to increase instantly in order to make the simulation more consistent with the actual situation the simulation object is replaced by the nonlinear norrbin model the track keeping effect track error sideslip angle observer output and steering condition are shown in fig 7 it can be seen from the partial enlarged part of fig 7 a that when the track error is large milos can guide the ship to approach the target track more quickly at each turning point milos can make the ship smoothly turn to track next section due to the time varying lookahead distance the rudder angle can be reduced to prevent overshoot when the track error is rather small because of using a fixed lookahead distance the position of the ship under los guidance oscillate on both sides of the target track the angle of turning at the sixth waypoint is relatively large the los guidance uses a fixed advance turning distance which causes the ship to have a large flare and oscillation between track sections with the biggest track error around 300m while milos uses the advance turning distance related to the angle of turning guiding the ship to turn approximately along the inscribed circle which is more in line with the requirements of navigation practice in terms of track error it can be seen from fig 7 b that los guidance cannot eliminate the static error caused by wind and current interference the sideslip angle observer of milos can effectively estimate the true value with the final estimation error around 0 2 from 2255 to 2260 s it can be known that the improved strategy equation 28 keeps the estimated value unchanged when its changing rate is large avoiding the sudden large increase caused by switching track section to the greatest extent thus avoiding actuator saturation using the estimated sideslip angle milos makes the track error finally converge to zero fig 7 d shows that the steering conditions of the two guidance methods are both reasonable the rudder angle magnitude and steering frequency of milos are slightly lower indicating less energy consumption in summary under the environment disturbance and limited actuator performance the proposed milos guidance can track the target path without any static track error which indicates its better static performance the smoother turning around each waypoint proved that it has obvious advantage in dynamic performance besides the steering condition under milos guidance is still reasonable which ensures its engineering availability remark 5 it can be seen from fig 7 c that due to the excessively large angle of turning at waypoint 6 the sideslip angle value is positive at first and then turns to negative when the positive sideslip angle appears the observer output is not yet stable therefore the estimated value of the sideslip angle remains unchanged according to equation 28 resulting that the true value cannot be estimated well however because the indirect track keeping control strategy only requires the ship to turn smoothly at the waypoint which means the accurate tracking of its nearby two sections is not necessary the estimation error of the sideslip angle will not affect the overall track keeping effect 6 conclusion this paper proposes an indirect nonlinear feedback concise robust track keeping control strategy based on navigation practice using the second order closed loop gain shaping algorithm fuzzy logic system and nonlinear feedback technique a course keeping controller with good robustness and energy saving effect is designed for the guidance system based on the nonlinear sideslip angle observer the time varying lookahead distance and a new advance turning distance related to the angle of turning the milos guidance law that meets the requirements of navigation practice and has excellent dynamic and static performance is proposed the effectiveness of the proposed scheme is verified by simulation experiments under various conditions and the results show that its comprehensive advantages are obvious which is of great significance
