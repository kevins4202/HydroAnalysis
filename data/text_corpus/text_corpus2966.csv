14830,long term anthropogenic nitrogen n and phosphorus p inputs have led to lake eutrophication and decreased environmental quality however the imbalance in nutrient cycling caused by ecosystem transformation during lake eutrophication is still unclear the n p organic matter om and their extractable forms in the sediment core of dianchi lake were investigated combining ecological data and geochronological techniques a coupling relationship between the evolution of lake ecosystems and nutrient retention was established the results show that the evolution of lake ecosystems promotes the accumulation and mobilization of n and p in sediments leading to an imbalance in nutrient cycling in the lake system from the macrophyte dominated period to the algae dominated period the accumulation rates of potential mobile n and p pmn pmp in sediments have significantly increased and the retention efficiency of total n and p tn tp has decreased the increased tn tp ratio 5 38 1 52 10 19 2 94 and

show that eutrophication has resulted in the potential mobilization of n in sediments exceeding p providing new insights for further understanding the nutrient cycle in the lake system and strengthening lake management graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords dianchi lake the macrophyte dominated period the algae dominated period nutrients imbalances data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the global eutrophication situation of lakes is not encouraging approximately 40 of lakes are negatively affected by eutrophication with the number of affected lakes expected to increase by 20 by 2050 ho et al 2019 zhou et al 2022 lake eutrophication is a natural process and it is impossible to eliminate it greeson 1969 however human activities can cause increased nutrient loading and accelerated eutrophication processes in lakes carpenter et al 2011 despite covering less than 1 of the land area lakes have a significant impact on human society and the global environment dudgeon et al 2006 ho and goethals 2019 as a result scientists around the world are concerned about how to slow the process of eutrophication in lakes it is now widely accepted that nutrient load reduction can help to mitigate eutrophication processes in lakes jeppesen et al 2005 cyanobacteria blooms have returned to some restored lakes in recent years despite extensive efforts to reduce the input of nutrients like p and n paerl et al 2016 lakes okeechobee winnipeg erie and cham plain in north america lakes lough neagh peipsi mälaren in europe and lakes taihu chaohu and dianchi in china have proved to be unsatisfactory in managing eutrophication and harmful algal blooms bunting et al 2016 conley et al 2009 qin et al 2020 watson et al 2016 this implies that previous understandings of lake eutrophication have some limitations such as focusing solely on reducing external nutrient loads and insufficient recognition of the internal nutrient cycling caused by geochemical processes in lakes sediment cores can be used to study nutrient exchange at the sediment water interface swi because they provide a record of sediment changes over time streib et al 2021 given its role in ensuring the continued primary productivity of lake ecosystems p has been regarded as a limiting factor of eutrophication lin et al 2017 the legacy p formed during sedimentation in large shallow lakes can be released over time with long term risks to aquatic ecosystems parsons et al 2017 another important nutrient that affects the sustainability of aquatic ecosystems is n and excessive anthropogenic n inputs can lead to eutrophication ding et al 2022 the deposition of n not only reflects the process of its transport and transformation but also responds to the long term evolution of the aquatic environment hong et al 2019 mostofa et al 2018 however the interplay of natural and human factors complicates the interpretation of the n record in sediments wang et al 2019a the deposition of om is closely associated with biota nutrient cycling and geochemical processes zhang et al 2016 when long term monitoring data for a lake is required om in sediment can provide valuable information about changes in and around the lake zhang et al 2018 many studies have been carried out using sediment cores to determine the cycling mechanisms of n or p and the retention pattern of om li et al 2022 liu et al 2022 xiang et al 2022 in contrast n and p imbalances caused by long term internal nutrient cycling in lakes have not been adequately researched therefore it is critical to reconstruct historical nutrient changes through sediment cores and to study the internal factors driving nutrient cycling in the lake huang et al 2018 matisoff et al 2016 changes to aquatic ecosystems can have a significant impact on the retention of n and p carnicer et al 2015 søndergaard et al 2003 yan et al 2016 in clean healthy aquatic ecosystems n and p are absorbed by plants and algae for growth woodruff et al 1999 this process of nutrient absorption results in lower nutrient concentrations in the water column which can help to prevent eutrophication and algae blooms christensen et al 1997 nutrient inputs may lead to transformations in aquatic ecosystems where excess nutrients stimulate the growth of harmful algae and other aquatic vegetation resulting in reduced retention efficiency and increased release of n and p from sediments elser et al 2009 finlay et al 2013 peñuelas and sardans 2022 zilius et al 2014 in addition to nutrient inputs other changes to aquatic ecosystems such as changes in hydrology or land use can also affect the retention of n and p qin et al 2019 for example increased water flow can lead to greater export of nutrients from upstream sources while changes in land use such as the conversion of forests to agriculture can lead to increased nutrient runoff and erosion wang et al 2019b effective management of nutrient inputs and the maintenance of healthy aquatic ecosystems are essential for promoting the retention of n and p and maintaining high water quality in lakes rivers and other aquatic environments elser et al 2007 therefore it is necessary to identify the extent to which ecosystem alterations drive the imbalance of nutrient retention in the lake this research focused on dianchi lake a typical large shallow plateau lake and one of the most eutrophic lakes in china natural water exchange in dianchi lake can take up to 3 5 years which creates ideal conditions for nutrient retention wu et al 2018a moreover the ecosystem of dianchi lake transformed from clear water to turbid water around the 1970s liu and wang 2016 the ensuing changes in internal nutrient cycling mechanisms drove the release of potentially mobile p which strongly influenced the sustainability of dianchi lake s ecosystem ding et al 2021 in comparison the high n release potential of dianchi lake contributed to the alteration of the aquatic population structure increasing the difficulty and complexity of ecosystem restoration ding et al 2022 through the sediment core our study reveals detailed om n and p accumulation situations in dianchi lake over more than a century we also provide a detailed explanation of the alterations in om n and p retention processes caused by the degradation of the dianchi lake aquatic ecosystem using pertinent geochronological and ecological data with this study we aimed to achieve the following objectives 1 understand the process of continued eutrophication caused by internal nutrient cycling in dianchi lake 2 elucidate the relationship between internal nutrient cycling with n and p imbalance 3 quantify the impact of aquatic ecosystems on nutrient retention and 4 offer a new perspective on the comprehensive management of eutrophication in large shallow lakes 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and sampling dianchi lake is located in kunming yunnan province

om n p om n p was assumed to accumulate at steady state yang et al 2022 the long term om n p release rate can be calculated as the difference between om n p accumulation rate at the sediment surface and om n p burial rate ombr nbr pbr at its stabilization depth rydin et al 2011 this difference between surface accumulation and stable layer burial also reflected the extent of long term om n p retention which was controlled by sediment biogeochemical and mineralogical processes dittrich et al 2013 the release rate of om n p can be expressed as markovic et al 2019 yang et al 2022 3 om n p r

information on changes to the aquatic ecosystem of dianchi lake from the 1870s to the 1960s the city kunming near dianchi lake was undeveloped and human activity was rare however with the onset of urbanization in the 1960s the population began to increase steadily submerged vegetation covered 86 1 of the lake in the 1960s to 1970s with 19 species present including ottelia acuminata 28 1 potamogeton malaianus 24 1 and myriophyllum spicatum 11 2 the lake was home to 186 species of algae dominated by chlorophyta and bacillariophyta with a low density ranging from 0 065 0 84 107 cell l between the 1970s and 1980s as urbanization population and gross domestic product gdp grew submerged vegetation coverage fell to 21 5 the dominant algae species shifted to chlorophyta bacillariophyta and cyanophyta with the density of algae rising to 0 24 1 24 107 cell l zoobenthos species structure changed significantly and the number of indigenous fish species declined urbanization population and gdp continued to rise in the 1980s to 1990s and submerged vegetation coverage decreased to 5 4 cyanophyta bacillariophyta and microcystis became the dominant algae species accounting for 89 of the total with the density of algae increasing significantly to 13 46 3 107 cell l the number of zoobenthos species and indigenous fish species declined sharply since the 1990s urbanization population and gdp have surged submerged vegetation coverage dropped to a mere 2 1 cyanophyta and microcystis dominated the total algae accounting for 93 73 and the density of algae was maintained at a high level ranging from 7 4 50 107 cell l 3 2 historical changes of om n and p in sediments the maximum fluorescence intensity fmax of parafac represents the relative content or intensity of parafac components fig 2 a details of excitation emission matrix parallel factor analysis eem parafac are displayed in supplementary results 2 1 and 2 2 between the 1870s and 1960s the fmax a u of the humic like components c1 c2 and c3 and the protein like component c4 remained relatively stable between the 1960s and 1970s the fmax of c2 and c3 rapidly increased the fmax of the two humic like components peaked between the 1970s and 1990s and dropped sharply between the 1990s and 2010s the content of c1 was relatively stable compared with the other two humic like substances the changes in c4 were different between the 1970s and 1990s with the fmax of c4 increasing only slightly and the real start of a rapid and sustained increase occurring between the 1990s and 2010s in addition as shown in supplementary results 2 3 we assessed the stability of fa components from various sources fig 2b and c shows the distribution of pmp sp pmn and sn over the sediment core the content of pmp increased during the 1870s and 1990s but then decreased from 420 81 mg kg to 384 63 mg kg between the 1990s and 2010s the content of sp remained relatively stable from the 1880s to the 1930s decreasing slightly to around 1000 mg kg from the 1930s to the 1960s it then increased rapidly from the 1960s to the 1980s but declined after the 1990s the variation of pmn gradually increased from the deep layer 340 4 mg kg to the surface layer 3613 9 mg kg the change pattern of sn was similar to that of pmn with a rapid increase in content between the 1960s and 2010s 3 3 equilibrium properties of sediment nutrients the ratio of humic like to protein like h p was relatively high 11 17 4 42 before the 1970s nonetheless the h p fell precipitously 5 97 3 67 after the 1970s fig 3 a the c n rose rapidly after the 1960s from 6 98 1 73 to 11 64 0 34 fig 3b the variability patterns of the pmn pmp and sn sp are nearly identical fig 3c and d between the 1870s and the 1960s pmn pmp remained at 4 55 0 88 and sn sp remained at 4 34 0 76 the pmn pmp and sn sp ratios increased from the 1960s to the 1970s reaching 6 77 0 46 and 7 28 0 94 respectively between the 1870s and 1970s the tn tp was 5 38 1 52 and then doubled from the 1970s to the 2010s fig 3e table s4 presents data on the accumulation and release rates of om n and p during two distinct periods during the macrophyte dominated period the accumulation rates of om n and p were 53 541 g m 2 a 1 3 682 g m 2 a 1 and 0 99 g m 2 a 1 respectively while the release rates were 41 204 g m 2 a 1 2 059 g m 2 a 1 and 0 109 g m 2 a 1 the retention efficiencies for om n and p during this period were 23 04 44 08 and 88 99 respectively in contrast the accumulation rates of om n and p were much higher during the algae dominated period at 124 819 g m 2 a 1 9 524 g m 2 a 1 and 1 262 g m 2 a 1 respectively while the release rates were 112 482 g m 2 a 1 7 901 g m 2 a 1 and 0 381 g m 2 a 1 respectively the retention efficiencies for om n and p during this period were 9 88 17 04 and 69 81 respectively 4 discussion 4 1 degradation characteristics of the aquatic ecosystem the change in dianchi lake s ecosystem can be divided into two periods the macrophyte dominated period from the 1870s to the 1970s and the algae dominated period from the 1970s to the 2010s during the macrophyte dominated period the coverage of macrophytes in dianchi lake was probably minimal due to the low nutrient content from the 1870s to the 1960s fig 2 the growth of macrophytes in dianchi lake was not well documented before the 1960s but the growth pattern of macrophytes can still be summarized using the rare growth recession model huang et al 2021 the model demonstrated that macrophytes were still the dominant species despite the low coverage before the 1960s potamogeton malaianus and myriophyllum spicatum had high coverage from the 1960s to the 1970s suggesting that nutrients imported into dianchi lake provided conditions for macrophyte growth this nutrient level allowed fouling tolerant species such as potamogeton malaianus and myriophyllum spicatum to flourish guan et al 2018 sun et al 2021 although ottelia acuminata a clean species was present during the same period lu et al 2022 the sudden increase in nutrient inputs from the 1960s to the 1970s did not cause serious pollution but posed a potential threat to the ecosystem of dianchi lake during the algae dominated period a series of reclaiming farmland from the lake reduced the living space of aquatic vegetation li et al 2014 the rapid development of agriculture and industry introduced a large number of external pollutants into dianchi lake resulting in a dramatic deterioration of the aquatic ecosystem li et al 2015 the continued input of nutrients created an environment conducive to algae growth furthermore the zoobenthos population structure changed dramatically with the fouling tolerant oligochaete and chironomid becoming the dominant species the population of indigenous fish declined sharply and some fish endemic to dianchi lake even vanished ecological restoration projects in dianchi lake have reduced input of external pollutants since the 1990s but further deterioration of the aquatic ecosystem e g algae blooms and eutrophication and a significant decline in ecological diversity persisted lu et al 2012 this suggested that the impact of the ecosystem upheaval on internal nutrient cycling in the lake is long lasting and far reaching 4 2 mechanisms of nutrient retention in sediment 4 2 1 macrophyte dominated period although the coverage of macrophytes was low before the 1960s as per the model based on aquatic vegetation development in section 4 1 the aquatic plant species of dianchi lake were still dominated by macrophytes however the population of aquatic plants experienced explosive growth between the 1960s and 1970s the increase in the coverage of aquatic vegetation was mainly caused by the input of terrigenous nutrients which can be observed in the rapid growth of c n δ 13c and δ 15n supplementary results 2 4 fig s5 aravena et al 1992 meyers and lallier vergés 1999 waser et al 1998 increased input from terrestrial sources between the 1960s and 1970s caused a shift in the ecosystem of dianchi lake the lower c n fig 2b before the 1960s indicated that the main source of sediment organic matter was aquatic vegetation meyers and lallier vergés 1999 the contribution of om from terrestrial sources increased rapidly from the 1960s to the 1970s the gradual increase in δ 13c reflected the expansion and dominance of macrophytes submerged plants use dissolved hco3 as a carbon source which may lead to raised δ 13c values keeley 1998 the value of δ 15n was also indicative of the source of om in sediments wada and hattori 1978 the lower δ 15n represented the source of om mainly from aquatic plant sources while the gradual upward trend of δ 15n might be caused by terrestrial inputs as the nutrient inputs increased fouling tolerant submerged plants with faster growth and mortality cycles replaced the prior submerged plants resulting in a rapid accumulation of plant debris in the sediment zhou et al 2013 the lignin produced by the decomposition of macrophyte debris was responsible for the high stability of the auto fa fraction fig s4a song et al 2020 wang et al 2018b in contrast the reduced stability of allo fa can be attributed to the input of terrestrial sources om represented by c3 it is worth mentioning that diatoms which happened to dominate the algae during this period have more stable components than other algae and are better suited to maintain the stability of om landa et al 2014 the intensive land shape transformation that began in the 1960s as well as point source pollution from urban development and non point source pollution from agricultural production have all contributed to the input of n and p wu et al 2022 usually elevated n content in lakes results from human activities such as municipal sewage and industrial wastewater where excess n is discharged into the lake and retained in the sediment through biochemical and physical processes seitzinger et al 2010 yang et al 2017 for example the absorption of n and p by submerged plants allows them to be retained in the sediment wang et al 2012 therefore the n accumulated during the 1960s and 1970s may have been imported from the land and then undergone processes such as absorption by plant roots and utilization by microorganisms in the sediment microorganisms utilized electrons provided by om for n transformation however the widespread presence of highly stable om e g humic like made it challenging for microorganisms to perform n transformation lyu et al 2021 rahman et al 2019 most of the humic like substances are resistant to biodegradation and rich in refractory condensed aromatics and tannins so the conversion efficiency of n is limited when large amounts of humic like substances sink into the sediment kellerman et al 2015 yao et al 2022 zhou et al 2021 moreover when om in the sediment is mostly non degradable the high microbial demand for n will lead to a limited release of n li et al 2020 simultaneously this meant that the limit might be released when the proportion of autochthonous components rose fig s4b or labile om entered the lake although most n conversions were restricted no3 n and pmon content increased significantly the increase in pmon content was easily understood because it is directly related to the increase in om content the increase in no3 n indicated that the nitrification process was unaffected and the sediment was likely in an oxic state which inhibited the release of p ma et al 2021 compared to n p is predominantly present in particulate form and the utilization and settling of p are more homogeneous qin et al 2020 from the 1960s to the 1970s the content of c1 c2 and c3 increased sharply the content of p increased equally indicating that p is sensitive to changes in humic like substances ordinarily p could be adsorbed into the sediment via physical and chemical processes humic like substances cause the physical adsorption of particulate p due to their unique material structure pédrot et al 2010 the om would be completely bound to the metal ions forming complexes that will provide additional adsorption sites for the phosphate ions thereby increasing p adsorption by the sediment li et al 2015 the content of nh4cl p bd p naoh nrp naoh rp and hcl p increased significantly from the 1960s to the 1970s fig 2c because of its loose physical structure nh4cl p was easily adsorbed by om meanwhile om is a carrier of naoh nrp org p and can bind to it via adhesion wu et al 2018b bd p fe p naoh rp al p and hcl p ca p p forms that were normally bound to metal ions also accumulated in large quantities in the sediment in particular the accumulation rate of hcl p ca p was 0 445 g m 2 a 1 the algae dominated period was 0 323 g m 2 a 1 calcite production by photosynthesis of macrophytes may have promoted the co precipitation of calcium and p wang et al 2022b overall the accumulation rates of bd p naoh rp and hcl p were fast and almost dominated the accumulation of p during the macrophyte dominated period fig 4 b the main accumulated p forms were similar to our previous findings ding et al 2021 4 2 2 algae dominated period the increase of δ 15n supplementary results 2 4 fig s5 suggested that the eutrophication of dianchi lake intensified and the denitrification was enhanced wang et al 2009a 2014 macrophytes vanished after the 1970s but δ 13c continued to rise demonstrating that algae bloomed and became the dominant species generally algae were more capable of utilizing dissolved hco3 as a carbon source for photosynthesis thus leading to an increased δ 13c value li et al 2022 consequently the contribution of algae to om increased in sediments the input of external contaminants was restricted after the 1990s the content of humic like components decreased rapidly c2 c3 or remained relatively stable c1 whereas protein like component content increased lu et al 2012 the source of humic like substances was diminished by the extinction of aquatic vegetation mentioned in section 4 1 and the blocking of terrestrial sources by ecological restoration initiatives the significant increase in protein like c4 content implied a large proliferation of algae concurrently the continued proliferation of algae in the presence of reduced external pollution indicated that internal nutrient cycling is a significant contributor to ecosystem degradation the act of reclaiming farmland from the lake resulted in the extinction of many aquatic plants and the loss of submerged vegetation increased the potential release risk of n and p the rapid drop in no3 n content suggested that strong dnra dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium and denitrification reactions had occurred in addition to the effect of dnra the increase in nh4 n content could be due to on mineralization ding et al 2022 furthermore an increase in nh4 n content will result in an increase in no2 n nitrification and pmon immobilization content yao et al 2022 the limitation of n mentioned in section 4 2 1 seemed to be released with the transformation between n forms we noticed that the stability ratios of auto fa between the 1970s and 1990s and allo fa between the 1990s and 2010s gradually decreased fig s4 the massive increase in algae derived om might be responsible for the reduced stability of om and the addition of labile om promoted the improvement of n conversion efficiency yao et al 2022 this would induce a strong exchange of n at the swi explaining the increased n concentration in the water column fig s6a the reduction in p retention could be associated with the change in om composition since the proportion of auto fa increased with the density of algae in dianchi lake fig s4b table 1 c4 in the auto fa component could represent algae derived om in this study algae derived om c4 contains more polysaccharides and carboxyl containing compounds than other om wen et al 2022 through electrostatic or π π interactions polysaccharides can form weak outer sphere complexes with sediments whereas carboxy compounds form stronger inner sphere complexes with minerals competing with phosphates for adsorption to sediments chen et al 2014 lee et al 2015 in other words om with protein like characteristics inhibited sediment adsorption of p explaining the increased p concentration in the water column fig s6a li et al 2015 this competitive sorption mechanism on the other hand will eventually increase nutrients in the water column resulting in a change in the algae and microbial community that use them as active substrates wen et al 2022 in general naoh rp and hcl p are thought to be inert enough to remain buried in sediment for a long time but these two inert p forms may transform into mobile forms when the algal blooms markovic et al 2019 matisoff et al 2016 yang et al 2020 typically res p is the most stable p and microorganisms can convert other unstable p to res p via secondary utilization chen et al 2015 the decrease in res p content suggested that changes in the microbial community make res p fixation more difficult the continued increase in bd p content was influenced by redox conditions such as iron oxides sorbing p in oxic conditions and releasing p in anaerobic sediment malmaeus et al 2012 this claim is supported by our findings of higher bd p content in the surface layer than in the deep sediments fig 2c as a result bd p can form a self circulation at the swi and be influenced by other external conditions moreover the biological structure has a strong influence on p retention and the clear water conditions generated by the biomanipulation result in lower p concentrations in the water column improving the retention efficiency of p in the sediment søndergaard et al 2003 however our study indicated that the increase in p concentration water column and p release rate sediments was most probably caused by the transformation of the aquatic ecosystem to turbid water such as the algae pump increased p release from sediments or n increased the release of p from sediments by stimulating the production of alkaline phosphatase alp in algae chen et al 2018 du et al 2022 ma et al 2018 with the southwest wind direction and water flow p rich algae would accumulate in the northern part of dianchi lake chen et al 2020 our previous study has confirmed that bd p which was found to be directly associated with the occurrence of algae blooms in the lake accumulated in the northern lake area ren et al 2022 4 3 imbalance of internal nutrient cycling in the lake human activities have increased the n p ratio molar basis in global ecosystems from 19 1 in the 1980s to 30 1 nowadays of which 16 1 for plankton peñuelas and sardans 2022 the n p ratio exceeding 16 1 in water column is considered to be an imbalanced n and p supply favoring algae blooms and causing n loading downstream howarth et al 2021 the imbalance in the accumulated and released n and p in sediments was attributed to a variety of factors including differences in nutrient availability absorption and cycling by different organisms in the ecosystem as well as changes in environmental conditions jeppesen et al 2005 during the macrophyte dominated period p was retained at a higher efficiency relative to n tn 44 08 tp 88 99 which could be attributed to the absorption of p by macrophytes and co precipitation woodruff et al 1999 while during the algae dominated period the higher accumulation tn 9 524 g m 2 a 1 tp 1 262 g m 2 a 1 and release rates tn 7 901 g m 2 a 1 tp 0 381 g m 2 a 1 of n relative to p could be attributed to the drive of algae and other microorganisms dai et al 2012 gobler et al 2016 the input of n into the aquatic system increased due to human activities such as agricultural practices industrialization and urbanization excessive n in lakes promoted the growth of primary producers e g macrophytes algae and microorganisms leading to the accumulation of labile om in the sediment the decomposition of om consumed oxygen creating anoxic conditions that favor the transformation between various n forms during this process pmn was released from the sediment at a much higher rate than pmp resulting in a disparity in pmn pmp 8 85 4 16 it is worth noting that the connection between n and om was very strong and the change in om composition h p decreased rapidly and approached 1 could be caused by an excess input of n when considering the n and p imbalance is not confined to the accumulation and retention of sediment the release imbalance can have a substantial impact on the lake ecosystem for example the degradation of aquatic vegetation due to excess ammonia n and the screening mechanisms of aquatic species by n cao et al 2007 2004 despite the reduction of external pollutant inputs to dianchi lake since the 1990s the tn tp and pmn pmp ratios have continued to elevate indicating that other factors may be contributing to the persistent imbalance after the 1990s urban domestic wastewater discharged after treatment by sewage plants became the primary source of nutrients 72 7 of tn and 42 8 of tp in dianchi lake gao et al 2013 comparing class ⅴ minimum standards of surface water quality and class 1a discharge standards implemented by 27 wastewater treatment plants in the dianchi basin https dgj km gov cn zfxxgk zfxxgknb of sewage plant discharge reveals two points 1 the maximum discharge standard of sewage plants is far away from the minimum standard of surface water quality 2 the tn tp of both standards exceeded 16 1 table s3 the first point explained part of the unsatisfactory water quality recovery in dianchi lake between the 1990s and 2010s the second point illustrated that since p is considered a major cause of algae blooms researchers and managers prioritize p control when monitoring pollution in sewage plants and lakes anthropogenic interventions in n and p inputs e g established discharge standards may have exacerbated nutrient imbalances in dianchi lake most visually evidenced by the simultaneous increase in n p ratios in the water column and sediment after the 1990s figs 3e and s6b typically om will be the source of c for denitrification to remove n from the water column whereas p released from the sediment will replenish the p lost in the water column resulting in a gradual decrease in the n p ratio qin et al 2020 the distinction in dianchi lake is that the long term external source input allowed a large number of nutrients to accumulate in the sediment resulting in a legacy effect søndergaard et al 2003 as the aquatic ecosystem transitioned from the macrophyte dominated period to the algae dominated period the retention efficiency of nutrients in the sediment especially n substantially declined om n and p declined by 13 16 27 04 and 19 18 respectively suggesting that nutrients were more readily released from the sediment into the water column this implied that strong internal nutrient cycling can still occur with reduced external inputs keeping the lake in constant eutrophication the differences in n and p cycling mechanisms pmn has a much faster accumulation and release rate than pmp caused an imbalance in n and p accumulation and release exacerbating nutrient imbalances in aquatic ecosystems these findings highlight the complexity of nutrient cycling in aquatic ecosystems and suggest that efforts to manage and mitigate nutrient imbalances in lakes must account for the interplay between biotic and abiotic factors that drive these processes further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms underlying nutrient imbalances in lakes and to identify effective strategies for promoting nutrient balance and reducing the negative impacts of eutrophication on lake ecosystems the observed nutrient imbalance in dianchi lake raises our consideration of whether the previous n and p management policies and practices can meet the future requirements for restoring and preserving the ecological integrity of the lake 4 4 environmental implications the nutrient imbalance induced by the dramatic changes in the ecosystem of dianchi lake has demanded more from the existing lake protection and management policies the previous management approach of controlling n and p inputs by enforcing established policies may not completely address the nutrient imbalance nutrient cycling has different response mechanisms in the macrophyte dominated ecosystem and algae dominated ecosystem respectively precisely this difference led to n in the sediment becoming more mobility than p during the deterioration of the ecosystem resulting in a persistent increase in n p ratios in the lake therefore the restoration of aquatic ecosystems is one of the most important approaches to solving the nutrient imbalance in lakes and the problems it causes such as algae blooms and eutrophication furthermore whether to reduce eutrophication in lakes by controlling n or by controlling p has been controversial internationally conley et al 2009 schindler et al 2008 this study of dianchi lake indicated that the contribution of controlling n in reducing the eutrophication of the lake cannot be ignored the initiative of tampa bay florida usa was worth following which achieved the restoration of vegetation coverage and reduction of algae blooms by reducing the n load in wastewater discharge greening et al 2011 in contrast the success of the wuli lake wuxi city jiangsu province china preservation effort was based on the government s effective administrative actions that accelerated the lake s ecological recovery through comprehensive management chen et al 2013 synthesizing our research and the successful experiences of wuli lake and tampa bay the nutrient imbalance in dianchi lake requires a combination of scientific approaches and comprehensive management to address meanwhile the issue of dianchi lake has lessons for large shallow lakes such as taihu lake and chaohu lake which also suffer from severe eutrophication and contain macrophyte and algae dominated regions respectively liu et al 2022 wang et al 2022a to address the situation of dianchi lake we believe that further efforts should be made in the following areas 1 develop an om n and p discharge plan based on the nutrient balance of the lake not only based on discharge standards 2 strengthen ecological restoration establish ecological buffer zones to reduce om n and p inputs and use macrophytes to reduce internal releases of om n and p 3 establish a long term flexible management mechanism to adapt to ecosystem changes 5 conclusion the sediment core from the center of the lake recorded a transition from macrophyte dominated to algae dominated ecosystems in dianchi lake over nearly 150 years and om n and p cycling mechanisms were significantly impacted during the macrophyte dominated period the retention efficiencies of om n and p were 23 04 44 08 and 88 99 respectively the composition of om was mainly influenced by aquatic vegetation and had high stability simultaneously p was retained in the sediment with high efficiency due to the function of aquatic vegetation and a clean aquatic environment the participation of n in nutrient cycling was limited because of restricted bioavailability resulting in the maintenance of a relatively high retention efficiency of n in the sediment the retention efficiency of om n and p was reduced sharply om 9 88 n 17 04 p 69 81 during the algae dominated period and a large amount of n and p were released into the water column the degradation of aquatic ecosystems has led to the accumulation of pmn exceeding pmp resulting in strong mobility of n and inducing nutrient cycling inevitably towards imbalance the anthropogenic interventions on n and p inputs to the lake may have further exacerbated the imbalance between n and p a series of environmental problems in dianchi lake such as algal blooms and eutrophication may be closely related to the phenomenon of n and p imbalance in the foreseeable future the problem of n and p imbalance may become an obstacle and shackle to the ecological restoration of dianchi lake comprehensive management and scientific approaches will help solve this problem declaration of competing interest the

14830,long term anthropogenic nitrogen n and phosphorus p inputs have led to lake eutrophication and decreased environmental quality however the imbalance in nutrient cycling caused by ecosystem transformation during lake eutrophication is still unclear the n p organic matter om and their extractable forms in the sediment core of dianchi lake were investigated combining ecological data and geochronological techniques a coupling relationship between the evolution of lake ecosystems and nutrient retention was established the results show that the evolution of lake ecosystems promotes the accumulation and mobilization of n and p in sediments leading to an imbalance in nutrient cycling in the lake system from the macrophyte dominated period to the algae dominated period the accumulation rates of potential mobile n and p pmn pmp in sediments have significantly increased and the retention efficiency of total n and p tn tp has decreased the increased tn tp ratio 5 38 1 52 10 19 2 94 and

show that eutrophication has resulted in the potential mobilization of n in sediments exceeding p providing new insights for further understanding the nutrient cycle in the lake system and strengthening lake management graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords dianchi lake the macrophyte dominated period the algae dominated period nutrients imbalances data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the global eutrophication situation of lakes is not encouraging approximately 40 of lakes are negatively affected by eutrophication with the number of affected lakes expected to increase by 20 by 2050 ho et al 2019 zhou et al 2022 lake eutrophication is a natural process and it is impossible to eliminate it greeson 1969 however human activities can cause increased nutrient loading and accelerated eutrophication processes in lakes carpenter et al 2011 despite covering less than 1 of the land area lakes have a significant impact on human society and the global environment dudgeon et al 2006 ho and goethals 2019 as a result scientists around the world are concerned about how to slow the process of eutrophication in lakes it is now widely accepted that nutrient load reduction can help to mitigate eutrophication processes in lakes jeppesen et al 2005 cyanobacteria blooms have returned to some restored lakes in recent years despite extensive efforts to reduce the input of nutrients like p and n paerl et al 2016 lakes okeechobee winnipeg erie and cham plain in north america lakes lough neagh peipsi mälaren in europe and lakes taihu chaohu and dianchi in china have proved to be unsatisfactory in managing eutrophication and harmful algal blooms bunting et al 2016 conley et al 2009 qin et al 2020 watson et al 2016 this implies that previous understandings of lake eutrophication have some limitations such as focusing solely on reducing external nutrient loads and insufficient recognition of the internal nutrient cycling caused by geochemical processes in lakes sediment cores can be used to study nutrient exchange at the sediment water interface swi because they provide a record of sediment changes over time streib et al 2021 given its role in ensuring the continued primary productivity of lake ecosystems p has been regarded as a limiting factor of eutrophication lin et al 2017 the legacy p formed during sedimentation in large shallow lakes can be released over time with long term risks to aquatic ecosystems parsons et al 2017 another important nutrient that affects the sustainability of aquatic ecosystems is n and excessive anthropogenic n inputs can lead to eutrophication ding et al 2022 the deposition of n not only reflects the process of its transport and transformation but also responds to the long term evolution of the aquatic environment hong et al 2019 mostofa et al 2018 however the interplay of natural and human factors complicates the interpretation of the n record in sediments wang et al 2019a the deposition of om is closely associated with biota nutrient cycling and geochemical processes zhang et al 2016 when long term monitoring data for a lake is required om in sediment can provide valuable information about changes in and around the lake zhang et al 2018 many studies have been carried out using sediment cores to determine the cycling mechanisms of n or p and the retention pattern of om li et al 2022 liu et al 2022 xiang et al 2022 in contrast n and p imbalances caused by long term internal nutrient cycling in lakes have not been adequately researched therefore it is critical to reconstruct historical nutrient changes through sediment cores and to study the internal factors driving nutrient cycling in the lake huang et al 2018 matisoff et al 2016 changes to aquatic ecosystems can have a significant impact on the retention of n and p carnicer et al 2015 søndergaard et al 2003 yan et al 2016 in clean healthy aquatic ecosystems n and p are absorbed by plants and algae for growth woodruff et al 1999 this process of nutrient absorption results in lower nutrient concentrations in the water column which can help to prevent eutrophication and algae blooms christensen et al 1997 nutrient inputs may lead to transformations in aquatic ecosystems where excess nutrients stimulate the growth of harmful algae and other aquatic vegetation resulting in reduced retention efficiency and increased release of n and p from sediments elser et al 2009 finlay et al 2013 peñuelas and sardans 2022 zilius et al 2014 in addition to nutrient inputs other changes to aquatic ecosystems such as changes in hydrology or land use can also affect the retention of n and p qin et al 2019 for example increased water flow can lead to greater export of nutrients from upstream sources while changes in land use such as the conversion of forests to agriculture can lead to increased nutrient runoff and erosion wang et al 2019b effective management of nutrient inputs and the maintenance of healthy aquatic ecosystems are essential for promoting the retention of n and p and maintaining high water quality in lakes rivers and other aquatic environments elser et al 2007 therefore it is necessary to identify the extent to which ecosystem alterations drive the imbalance of nutrient retention in the lake this research focused on dianchi lake a typical large shallow plateau lake and one of the most eutrophic lakes in china natural water exchange in dianchi lake can take up to 3 5 years which creates ideal conditions for nutrient retention wu et al 2018a moreover the ecosystem of dianchi lake transformed from clear water to turbid water around the 1970s liu and wang 2016 the ensuing changes in internal nutrient cycling mechanisms drove the release of potentially mobile p which strongly influenced the sustainability of dianchi lake s ecosystem ding et al 2021 in comparison the high n release potential of dianchi lake contributed to the alteration of the aquatic population structure increasing the difficulty and complexity of ecosystem restoration ding et al 2022 through the sediment core our study reveals detailed om n and p accumulation situations in dianchi lake over more than a century we also provide a detailed explanation of the alterations in om n and p retention processes caused by the degradation of the dianchi lake aquatic ecosystem using pertinent geochronological and ecological data with this study we aimed to achieve the following objectives 1 understand the process of continued eutrophication caused by internal nutrient cycling in dianchi lake 2 elucidate the relationship between internal nutrient cycling with n and p imbalance 3 quantify the impact of aquatic ecosystems on nutrient retention and 4 offer a new perspective on the comprehensive management of eutrophication in large shallow lakes 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and sampling dianchi lake is located in kunming yunnan province

information on changes to the aquatic ecosystem of dianchi lake from the 1870s to the 1960s the city kunming near dianchi lake was undeveloped and human activity was rare however with the onset of urbanization in the 1960s the population began to increase steadily submerged vegetation covered 86 1 of the lake in the 1960s to 1970s with 19 species present including ottelia acuminata 28 1 potamogeton malaianus 24 1 and myriophyllum spicatum 11 2 the lake was home to 186 species of algae dominated by chlorophyta and bacillariophyta with a low density ranging from 0 065 0 84 107 cell l between the 1970s and 1980s as urbanization population and gross domestic product gdp grew submerged vegetation coverage fell to 21 5 the dominant algae species shifted to chlorophyta bacillariophyta and cyanophyta with the density of algae rising to 0 24 1 24 107 cell l zoobenthos species structure changed significantly and the number of indigenous fish species declined urbanization population and gdp continued to rise in the 1980s to 1990s and submerged vegetation coverage decreased to 5 4 cyanophyta bacillariophyta and microcystis became the dominant algae species accounting for 89 of the total with the density of algae increasing significantly to 13 46 3 107 cell l the number of zoobenthos species and indigenous fish species declined sharply since the 1990s urbanization population and gdp have surged submerged vegetation coverage dropped to a mere 2 1 cyanophyta and microcystis dominated the total algae accounting for 93 73 and the density of algae was maintained at a high level ranging from 7 4 50 107 cell l 3 2 historical changes of om n and p in sediments the maximum fluorescence intensity fmax of parafac represents the relative content or intensity of parafac components fig 2 a details of excitation emission matrix parallel factor analysis eem parafac are displayed in supplementary results 2 1 and 2 2 between the 1870s and 1960s the fmax a u of the humic like components c1 c2 and c3 and the protein like component c4 remained relatively stable between the 1960s and 1970s the fmax of c2 and c3 rapidly increased the fmax of the two humic like components peaked between the 1970s and 1990s and dropped sharply between the 1990s and 2010s the content of c1 was relatively stable compared with the other two humic like substances the changes in c4 were different between the 1970s and 1990s with the fmax of c4 increasing only slightly and the real start of a rapid and sustained increase occurring between the 1990s and 2010s in addition as shown in supplementary results 2 3 we assessed the stability of fa components from various sources fig 2b and c shows the distribution of pmp sp pmn and sn over the sediment core the content of pmp increased during the 1870s and 1990s but then decreased from 420 81 mg kg to 384 63 mg kg between the 1990s and 2010s the content of sp remained relatively stable from the 1880s to the 1930s decreasing slightly to around 1000 mg kg from the 1930s to the 1960s it then increased rapidly from the 1960s to the 1980s but declined after the 1990s the variation of pmn gradually increased from the deep layer 340 4 mg kg to the surface layer 3613 9 mg kg the change pattern of sn was similar to that of pmn with a rapid increase in content between the 1960s and 2010s 3 3 equilibrium properties of sediment nutrients the ratio of humic like to protein like h p was relatively high 11 17 4 42 before the 1970s nonetheless the h p fell precipitously 5 97 3 67 after the 1970s fig 3 a the c n rose rapidly after the 1960s from 6 98 1 73 to 11 64 0 34 fig 3b the variability patterns of the pmn pmp and sn sp are nearly identical fig 3c and d between the 1870s and the 1960s pmn pmp remained at 4 55 0 88 and sn sp remained at 4 34 0 76 the pmn pmp and sn sp ratios increased from the 1960s to the 1970s reaching 6 77 0 46 and 7 28 0 94 respectively between the 1870s and 1970s the tn tp was 5 38 1 52 and then doubled from the 1970s to the 2010s fig 3e table s4 presents data on the accumulation and release rates of om n and p during two distinct periods during the macrophyte dominated period the accumulation rates of om n and p were 53 541 g m 2 a 1 3 682 g m 2 a 1 and 0 99 g m 2 a 1 respectively while the release rates were 41 204 g m 2 a 1 2 059 g m 2 a 1 and 0 109 g m 2 a 1 the retention efficiencies for om n and p during this period were 23 04 44 08 and 88 99 respectively in contrast the accumulation rates of om n and p were much higher during the algae dominated period at 124 819 g m 2 a 1 9 524 g m 2 a 1 and 1 262 g m 2 a 1 respectively while the release rates were 112 482 g m 2 a 1 7 901 g m 2 a 1 and 0 381 g m 2 a 1 respectively the retention efficiencies for om n and p during this period were 9 88 17 04 and 69 81 respectively 4 discussion 4 1 degradation characteristics of the aquatic ecosystem the change in dianchi lake s ecosystem can be divided into two periods the macrophyte dominated period from the 1870s to the 1970s and the algae dominated period from the 1970s to the 2010s during the macrophyte dominated period the coverage of macrophytes in dianchi lake was probably minimal due to the low nutrient content from the 1870s to the 1960s fig 2 the growth of macrophytes in dianchi lake was not well documented before the 1960s but the growth pattern of macrophytes can still be summarized using the rare growth recession model huang et al 2021 the model demonstrated that macrophytes were still the dominant species despite the low coverage before the 1960s potamogeton malaianus and myriophyllum spicatum had high coverage from the 1960s to the 1970s suggesting that nutrients imported into dianchi lake provided conditions for macrophyte growth this nutrient level allowed fouling tolerant species such as potamogeton malaianus and myriophyllum spicatum to flourish guan et al 2018 sun et al 2021 although ottelia acuminata a clean species was present during the same period lu et al 2022 the sudden increase in nutrient inputs from the 1960s to the 1970s did not cause serious pollution but posed a potential threat to the ecosystem of dianchi lake during the algae dominated period a series of reclaiming farmland from the lake reduced the living space of aquatic vegetation li et al 2014 the rapid development of agriculture and industry introduced a large number of external pollutants into dianchi lake resulting in a dramatic deterioration of the aquatic ecosystem li et al 2015 the continued input of nutrients created an environment conducive to algae growth furthermore the zoobenthos population structure changed dramatically with the fouling tolerant oligochaete and chironomid becoming the dominant species the population of indigenous fish declined sharply and some fish endemic to dianchi lake even vanished ecological restoration projects in dianchi lake have reduced input of external pollutants since the 1990s but further deterioration of the aquatic ecosystem e g algae blooms and eutrophication and a significant decline in ecological diversity persisted lu et al 2012 this suggested that the impact of the ecosystem upheaval on internal nutrient cycling in the lake is long lasting and far reaching 4 2 mechanisms of nutrient retention in sediment 4 2 1 macrophyte dominated period although the coverage of macrophytes was low before the 1960s as per the model based on aquatic vegetation development in section 4 1 the aquatic plant species of dianchi lake were still dominated by macrophytes however the population of aquatic plants experienced explosive growth between the 1960s and 1970s the increase in the coverage of aquatic vegetation was mainly caused by the input of terrigenous nutrients which can be observed in the rapid growth of c n δ 13c and δ 15n supplementary results 2 4 fig s5 aravena et al 1992 meyers and lallier vergés 1999 waser et al 1998 increased input from terrestrial sources between the 1960s and 1970s caused a shift in the ecosystem of dianchi lake the lower c n fig 2b before the 1960s indicated that the main source of sediment organic matter was aquatic vegetation meyers and lallier vergés 1999 the contribution of om from terrestrial sources increased rapidly from the 1960s to the 1970s the gradual increase in δ 13c reflected the expansion and dominance of macrophytes submerged plants use dissolved hco3 as a carbon source which may lead to raised δ 13c values keeley 1998 the value of δ 15n was also indicative of the source of om in sediments wada and hattori 1978 the lower δ 15n represented the source of om mainly from aquatic plant sources while the gradual upward trend of δ 15n might be caused by terrestrial inputs as the nutrient inputs increased fouling tolerant submerged plants with faster growth and mortality cycles replaced the prior submerged plants resulting in a rapid accumulation of plant debris in the sediment zhou et al 2013 the lignin produced by the decomposition of macrophyte debris was responsible for the high stability of the auto fa fraction fig s4a song et al 2020 wang et al 2018b in contrast the reduced stability of allo fa can be attributed to the input of terrestrial sources om represented by c3 it is worth mentioning that diatoms which happened to dominate the algae during this period have more stable components than other algae and are better suited to maintain the stability of om landa et al 2014 the intensive land shape transformation that began in the 1960s as well as point source pollution from urban development and non point source pollution from agricultural production have all contributed to the input of n and p wu et al 2022 usually elevated n content in lakes results from human activities such as municipal sewage and industrial wastewater where excess n is discharged into the lake and retained in the sediment through biochemical and physical processes seitzinger et al 2010 yang et al 2017 for example the absorption of n and p by submerged plants allows them to be retained in the sediment wang et al 2012 therefore the n accumulated during the 1960s and 1970s may have been imported from the land and then undergone processes such as absorption by plant roots and utilization by microorganisms in the sediment microorganisms utilized electrons provided by om for n transformation however the widespread presence of highly stable om e g humic like made it challenging for microorganisms to perform n transformation lyu et al 2021 rahman et al 2019 most of the humic like substances are resistant to biodegradation and rich in refractory condensed aromatics and tannins so the conversion efficiency of n is limited when large amounts of humic like substances sink into the sediment kellerman et al 2015 yao et al 2022 zhou et al 2021 moreover when om in the sediment is mostly non degradable the high microbial demand for n will lead to a limited release of n li et al 2020 simultaneously this meant that the limit might be released when the proportion of autochthonous components rose fig s4b or labile om entered the lake although most n conversions were restricted no3 n and pmon content increased significantly the increase in pmon content was easily understood because it is directly related to the increase in om content the increase in no3 n indicated that the nitrification process was unaffected and the sediment was likely in an oxic state which inhibited the release of p ma et al 2021 compared to n p is predominantly present in particulate form and the utilization and settling of p are more homogeneous qin et al 2020 from the 1960s to the 1970s the content of c1 c2 and c3 increased sharply the content of p increased equally indicating that p is sensitive to changes in humic like substances ordinarily p could be adsorbed into the sediment via physical and chemical processes humic like substances cause the physical adsorption of particulate p due to their unique material structure pédrot et al 2010 the om would be completely bound to the metal ions forming complexes that will provide additional adsorption sites for the phosphate ions thereby increasing p adsorption by the sediment li et al 2015 the content of nh4cl p bd p naoh nrp naoh rp and hcl p increased significantly from the 1960s to the 1970s fig 2c because of its loose physical structure nh4cl p was easily adsorbed by om meanwhile om is a carrier of naoh nrp org p and can bind to it via adhesion wu et al 2018b bd p fe p naoh rp al p and hcl p ca p p forms that were normally bound to metal ions also accumulated in large quantities in the sediment in particular the accumulation rate of hcl p ca p was 0 445 g m 2 a 1 the algae dominated period was 0 323 g m 2 a 1 calcite production by photosynthesis of macrophytes may have promoted the co precipitation of calcium and p wang et al 2022b overall the accumulation rates of bd p naoh rp and hcl p were fast and almost dominated the accumulation of p during the macrophyte dominated period fig 4 b the main accumulated p forms were similar to our previous findings ding et al 2021 4 2 2 algae dominated period the increase of δ 15n supplementary results 2 4 fig s5 suggested that the eutrophication of dianchi lake intensified and the denitrification was enhanced wang et al 2009a 2014 macrophytes vanished after the 1970s but δ 13c continued to rise demonstrating that algae bloomed and became the dominant species generally algae were more capable of utilizing dissolved hco3 as a carbon source for photosynthesis thus leading to an increased δ 13c value li et al 2022 consequently the contribution of algae to om increased in sediments the input of external contaminants was restricted after the 1990s the content of humic like components decreased rapidly c2 c3 or remained relatively stable c1 whereas protein like component content increased lu et al 2012 the source of humic like substances was diminished by the extinction of aquatic vegetation mentioned in section 4 1 and the blocking of terrestrial sources by ecological restoration initiatives the significant increase in protein like c4 content implied a large proliferation of algae concurrently the continued proliferation of algae in the presence of reduced external pollution indicated that internal nutrient cycling is a significant contributor to ecosystem degradation the act of reclaiming farmland from the lake resulted in the extinction of many aquatic plants and the loss of submerged vegetation increased the potential release risk of n and p the rapid drop in no3 n content suggested that strong dnra dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium and denitrification reactions had occurred in addition to the effect of dnra the increase in nh4 n content could be due to on mineralization ding et al 2022 furthermore an increase in nh4 n content will result in an increase in no2 n nitrification and pmon immobilization content yao et al 2022 the limitation of n mentioned in section 4 2 1 seemed to be released with the transformation between n forms we noticed that the stability ratios of auto fa between the 1970s and 1990s and allo fa between the 1990s and 2010s gradually decreased fig s4 the massive increase in algae derived om might be responsible for the reduced stability of om and the addition of labile om promoted the improvement of n conversion efficiency yao et al 2022 this would induce a strong exchange of n at the swi explaining the increased n concentration in the water column fig s6a the reduction in p retention could be associated with the change in om composition since the proportion of auto fa increased with the density of algae in dianchi lake fig s4b table 1 c4 in the auto fa component could represent algae derived om in this study algae derived om c4 contains more polysaccharides and carboxyl containing compounds than other om wen et al 2022 through electrostatic or π π interactions polysaccharides can form weak outer sphere complexes with sediments whereas carboxy compounds form stronger inner sphere complexes with minerals competing with phosphates for adsorption to sediments chen et al 2014 lee et al 2015 in other words om with protein like characteristics inhibited sediment adsorption of p explaining the increased p concentration in the water column fig s6a li et al 2015 this competitive sorption mechanism on the other hand will eventually increase nutrients in the water column resulting in a change in the algae and microbial community that use them as active substrates wen et al 2022 in general naoh rp and hcl p are thought to be inert enough to remain buried in sediment for a long time but these two inert p forms may transform into mobile forms when the algal blooms markovic et al 2019 matisoff et al 2016 yang et al 2020 typically res p is the most stable p and microorganisms can convert other unstable p to res p via secondary utilization chen et al 2015 the decrease in res p content suggested that changes in the microbial community make res p fixation more difficult the continued increase in bd p content was influenced by redox conditions such as iron oxides sorbing p in oxic conditions and releasing p in anaerobic sediment malmaeus et al 2012 this claim is supported by our findings of higher bd p content in the surface layer than in the deep sediments fig 2c as a result bd p can form a self circulation at the swi and be influenced by other external conditions moreover the biological structure has a strong influence on p retention and the clear water conditions generated by the biomanipulation result in lower p concentrations in the water column improving the retention efficiency of p in the sediment søndergaard et al 2003 however our study indicated that the increase in p concentration water column and p release rate sediments was most probably caused by the transformation of the aquatic ecosystem to turbid water such as the algae pump increased p release from sediments or n increased the release of p from sediments by stimulating the production of alkaline phosphatase alp in algae chen et al 2018 du et al 2022 ma et al 2018 with the southwest wind direction and water flow p rich algae would accumulate in the northern part of dianchi lake chen et al 2020 our previous study has confirmed that bd p which was found to be directly associated with the occurrence of algae blooms in the lake accumulated in the northern lake area ren et al 2022 4 3 imbalance of internal nutrient cycling in the lake human activities have increased the n p ratio molar basis in global ecosystems from 19 1 in the 1980s to 30 1 nowadays of which 16 1 for plankton peñuelas and sardans 2022 the n p ratio exceeding 16 1 in water column is considered to be an imbalanced n and p supply favoring algae blooms and causing n loading downstream howarth et al 2021 the imbalance in the accumulated and released n and p in sediments was attributed to a variety of factors including differences in nutrient availability absorption and cycling by different organisms in the ecosystem as well as changes in environmental conditions jeppesen et al 2005 during the macrophyte dominated period p was retained at a higher efficiency relative to n tn 44 08 tp 88 99 which could be attributed to the absorption of p by macrophytes and co precipitation woodruff et al 1999 while during the algae dominated period the higher accumulation tn 9 524 g m 2 a 1 tp 1 262 g m 2 a 1 and release rates tn 7 901 g m 2 a 1 tp 0 381 g m 2 a 1 of n relative to p could be attributed to the drive of algae and other microorganisms dai et al 2012 gobler et al 2016 the input of n into the aquatic system increased due to human activities such as agricultural practices industrialization and urbanization excessive n in lakes promoted the growth of primary producers e g macrophytes algae and microorganisms leading to the accumulation of labile om in the sediment the decomposition of om consumed oxygen creating anoxic conditions that favor the transformation between various n forms during this process pmn was released from the sediment at a much higher rate than pmp resulting in a disparity in pmn pmp 8 85 4 16 it is worth noting that the connection between n and om was very strong and the change in om composition h p decreased rapidly and approached 1 could be caused by an excess input of n when considering the n and p imbalance is not confined to the accumulation and retention of sediment the release imbalance can have a substantial impact on the lake ecosystem for example the degradation of aquatic vegetation due to excess ammonia n and the screening mechanisms of aquatic species by n cao et al 2007 2004 despite the reduction of external pollutant inputs to dianchi lake since the 1990s the tn tp and pmn pmp ratios have continued to elevate indicating that other factors may be contributing to the persistent imbalance after the 1990s urban domestic wastewater discharged after treatment by sewage plants became the primary source of nutrients 72 7 of tn and 42 8 of tp in dianchi lake gao et al 2013 comparing class ⅴ minimum standards of surface water quality and class 1a discharge standards implemented by 27 wastewater treatment plants in the dianchi basin https dgj km gov cn zfxxgk zfxxgknb of sewage plant discharge reveals two points 1 the maximum discharge standard of sewage plants is far away from the minimum standard of surface water quality 2 the tn tp of both standards exceeded 16 1 table s3 the first point explained part of the unsatisfactory water quality recovery in dianchi lake between the 1990s and 2010s the second point illustrated that since p is considered a major cause of algae blooms researchers and managers prioritize p control when monitoring pollution in sewage plants and lakes anthropogenic interventions in n and p inputs e g established discharge standards may have exacerbated nutrient imbalances in dianchi lake most visually evidenced by the simultaneous increase in n p ratios in the water column and sediment after the 1990s figs 3e and s6b typically om will be the source of c for denitrification to remove n from the water column whereas p released from the sediment will replenish the p lost in the water column resulting in a gradual decrease in the n p ratio qin et al 2020 the distinction in dianchi lake is that the long term external source input allowed a large number of nutrients to accumulate in the sediment resulting in a legacy effect søndergaard et al 2003 as the aquatic ecosystem transitioned from the macrophyte dominated period to the algae dominated period the retention efficiency of nutrients in the sediment especially n substantially declined om n and p declined by 13 16 27 04 and 19 18 respectively suggesting that nutrients were more readily released from the sediment into the water column this implied that strong internal nutrient cycling can still occur with reduced external inputs keeping the lake in constant eutrophication the differences in n and p cycling mechanisms pmn has a much faster accumulation and release rate than pmp caused an imbalance in n and p accumulation and release exacerbating nutrient imbalances in aquatic ecosystems these findings highlight the complexity of nutrient cycling in aquatic ecosystems and suggest that efforts to manage and mitigate nutrient imbalances in lakes must account for the interplay between biotic and abiotic factors that drive these processes further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms underlying nutrient imbalances in lakes and to identify effective strategies for promoting nutrient balance and reducing the negative impacts of eutrophication on lake ecosystems the observed nutrient imbalance in dianchi lake raises our consideration of whether the previous n and p management policies and practices can meet the future requirements for restoring and preserving the ecological integrity of the lake 4 4 environmental implications the nutrient imbalance induced by the dramatic changes in the ecosystem of dianchi lake has demanded more from the existing lake protection and management policies the previous management approach of controlling n and p inputs by enforcing established policies may not completely address the nutrient imbalance nutrient cycling has different response mechanisms in the macrophyte dominated ecosystem and algae dominated ecosystem respectively precisely this difference led to n in the sediment becoming more mobility than p during the deterioration of the ecosystem resulting in a persistent increase in n p ratios in the lake therefore the restoration of aquatic ecosystems is one of the most important approaches to solving the nutrient imbalance in lakes and the problems it causes such as algae blooms and eutrophication furthermore whether to reduce eutrophication in lakes by controlling n or by controlling p has been controversial internationally conley et al 2009 schindler et al 2008 this study of dianchi lake indicated that the contribution of controlling n in reducing the eutrophication of the lake cannot be ignored the initiative of tampa bay florida usa was worth following which achieved the restoration of vegetation coverage and reduction of algae blooms by reducing the n load in wastewater discharge greening et al 2011 in contrast the success of the wuli lake wuxi city jiangsu province china preservation effort was based on the government s effective administrative actions that accelerated the lake s ecological recovery through comprehensive management chen et al 2013 synthesizing our research and the successful experiences of wuli lake and tampa bay the nutrient imbalance in dianchi lake requires a combination of scientific approaches and comprehensive management to address meanwhile the issue of dianchi lake has lessons for large shallow lakes such as taihu lake and chaohu lake which also suffer from severe eutrophication and contain macrophyte and algae dominated regions respectively liu et al 2022 wang et al 2022a to address the situation of dianchi lake we believe that further efforts should be made in the following areas 1 develop an om n and p discharge plan based on the nutrient balance of the lake not only based on discharge standards 2 strengthen ecological restoration establish ecological buffer zones to reduce om n and p inputs and use macrophytes to reduce internal releases of om n and p 3 establish a long term flexible management mechanism to adapt to ecosystem changes 5 conclusion the sediment core from the center of the lake recorded a transition from macrophyte dominated to algae dominated ecosystems in dianchi lake over nearly 150 years and om n and p cycling mechanisms were significantly impacted during the macrophyte dominated period the retention efficiencies of om n and p were 23 04 44 08 and 88 99 respectively the composition of om was mainly influenced by aquatic vegetation and had high stability simultaneously p was retained in the sediment with high efficiency due to the function of aquatic vegetation and a clean aquatic environment the participation of n in nutrient cycling was limited because of restricted bioavailability resulting in the maintenance of a relatively high retention efficiency of n in the sediment the retention efficiency of om n and p was reduced sharply om 9 88 n 17 04 p 69 81 during the algae dominated period and a large amount of n and p were released into the water column the degradation of aquatic ecosystems has led to the accumulation of pmn exceeding pmp resulting in strong mobility of n and inducing nutrient cycling inevitably towards imbalance the anthropogenic interventions on n and p inputs to the lake may have further exacerbated the imbalance between n and p a series of environmental problems in dianchi lake such as algal blooms and eutrophication may be closely related to the phenomenon of n and p imbalance in the foreseeable future the problem of n and p imbalance may become an obstacle and shackle to the ecological restoration of dianchi lake comprehensive management and scientific approaches will help solve this problem declaration of competing interest the

14831,the variation in cake layer three dimensional 3d structures and related water channel characteristics induced by coagulation pretreatment remains unclear however gaining such knowledge will aid in improving ultrafiltration uf efficiency for water purification herein the regulation of cake layer 3d structures 3d distribution of organic foulants within cake layers by al based coagulation pretreatment was analyzed at the micro nanoscale the sandwich like cake layer of humic acids and sodium alginate induced without coagulation was ruptured and foulants were gradually uniformly distributed within the floc layer toward an isotropic structure with increasing coagulant dosage a critical dosage was observed furthermore the structure of the foulant floc layer was more isotropic when coagulants with high al13 concentrations were used either alcl3 at ph 6 or polyaluminum chloride in comparison with alcl3 at ph 8 where small molecular weight humic acids were enriched near the membrane these high al13 concentrations lead to a 48 4 higher specific membrane flux than that seen for uf without coagulation molecular dynamics simulations revealed that with increasing al13 concentration al13 6 2 to 22 6 the water channels within the cake layer were enlarged and more connected and the water transport coefficient was improved by up to 54 1 indicating faster water transport these findings demonstrate that facilitating an isotropic foulant floc layer with highly connected water channels by coagulation pretreatment with high al13 concentration coagulants having a strong ability to complex organic foulants is the key issue in optimizing the uf efficiency for water purification the results should provide further understanding of the underlying mechanisms of coagulation enhancing uf behavior and inspire precise design of coagulation pretreatment to achieve efficient uf graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords drinking water ultrafiltration coagulation pretreatment three dimensional structure water channel filtration behavior data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction a shortage of clean drinking water is one of the main threats to humans worldwide kim et al 2010 mauter et al 2018 ultrafiltration uf as an efficient water purification technology has been increasingly employed in drinking water treatment plants because of the constant quality of effluents lipp 2008 resosudarmo et al 2013 shannon et al 2008 wang and tang 2011 the global uf market reached 950 million dollars in 2017 aani et al 2020 however its further application is substantially restricted by membrane fouling by which the energy used during uf and the cost of membrane replacement are increased katsoufidou et al 2010 mukherjee et al 2018 yu and zhang 2019 zhang et al 2003 cake layer formation gradually becomes the predominant fouling mechanism for uf membranes in long term operation even causing higher than 90 additional energy and costs she et al 2009 during long term operation in drinking water treatment cake layers caused by natural organic matter nom primarily composed of humic substances hs followed by polysaccharides and proteins kennedy et al 2005 zhao et al 2021 gradually become the key factor governing uf membrane fouling taniguchi et al 2003 wang et al 2013 zhang et al 2013 the characteristics of the cake layers exert a significant influence on the water channels and related water transport properties within the cake layers resulting in different uf behaviors e g flux amjad et al 2015 wang and waite 2008 for instance the uf flux has been improved by reducing the compactness sun et al 2018 wang and tang 2011 and thickness lee et al 2005 of the cake layer in addition to the characteristics of the whole cake layer the three dimensional 3d structure of the cake layer that is the 3d spatial distribution of foulants within the cake layer plays a crucial role wu et al 2021 the 3d structure of the cake layer is related to the 3d distribution of matter density in a nanoscale analog the polyamide density 3d distribution in reverse osmosis membranes influences their water channel characteristics e g the proportion and connectivity culp et al 2021 additionally variations in the cake layer 3d structure can contribute to changes in the 3d distribution of functional groups leading to different interactions with water which is transported through the cake layer these distinct water channels induced by different cake layer 3d structures can facilitate the variation in water transport efficiency and related uf water flux therefore scientifically regulating the 3d structure of the cake layer should be an effective strategy to improve uf efficiency for water purification however in depth insights into the cake layer 3d structure and water channels remain insufficient owing to the lack of proper characterization technologies leading to limited guidance for the tailored regulation of cake layers recently many types of pretreatments have been applied to regulate cake layers huang et al 2009 such as oxidation cheng et al 2018 adsorption malczewska and benjamin 2016 and sand filtration ferrer et al 2015 aiming to mitigate membrane fouling and improve uf efficiency coagulation is the most common pretreatment used in practical drinking water treatment plants because of its simple operation and low maintenance choi and dempsey 2004 the cake layer regulation using al based coagulants has been widely investigated owing to its strong ability to aggregate nom through charge neutralization and sweep flocculation konieczny et al 2009 mao et al 2013 wang et al 2002 zhou and meng 2016 however previous studies have primarily focused on the transformation of the macro characteristics of cake layers such as looseness and thickness feng et al 2015 masmoudi et al 2016 the variation in cake layer 3d structures and water channels within cake layers are less clarified owing to the limitation of characterization technologies whereas it is the key factor influencing water transport efficiency and uf behavior therefore the mechanisms underlying coagulation enhancing uf behavior are still not comprehensively understood clarifying the transformation of cake layer 3d structures and related water channel characteristics induced by coagulation pretreatment is vital and could provide a theoretical basis for the development of efficient coagulation uf processes traditional characterization approaches such as optical coherence tomography difficult to discriminate foulants dreszer et al 2014 gao et al 2014 li et al 2016 raman spectroscopy unable to obtain depth profiles chen et al 2017 virtanen et al 2017 and confocal laser scanning microscopy requirement of fluorescent labels ferrando et al 2005 le clech et al 2007 marroquin et al 2014 are incapable of analyzing the precise 3d structure of micro nanoscale cake layers chen et al 2018 in our previous study wu et al 2021 a time of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry tof sims was determined to be appropriate for the analysis of cake layer 3d structures at the

zhu et al 2015 more information about its working principle is shown in si text s1 herein the transformation of cake layer 3d structures induced by al based coagulation pretreatment was investigated

speciation polyaluminum chloride pacl high concentration of al13 were further investigated molecular dynamics md simulations were conducted to clarify the variation in water channel characteristics and water transport behavior humic acid ha bovine serum albumin bsa and sodium alginate sa were used as the representations of hs polysaccharides and proteins respectively to investigate cake layers formed by nom contreras et al 2011 binary foulant mixtures simulating surface source water and raw water collected from the beijing section of the south to north water diversion project china were used as the feed water 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the information of reagents uf membranes and raw water is provided in supporting information si method s1 the characteristics of raw water are listed in si table s1 2 2 uf experiments during uf a 300 ml ha sa or ha bsa mixture 20 mg l a similar total organic carbon to surface source water 7 1 0 4 mg l 1 was used as the feed solution for the coagulation uf process coagulation pretreatment was conducted before filtration after coagulation 300 ml of the feed solution was filtered directly for the coagulation sedimentation uf csuf process the solution obtained after coagulation was kept static for 10 or 30 min and 300 ml of the supernatant was collected and filtered after filtering 300 ml of the solution the fouled membrane was

regulation of cake layer 3d structures by al based coagulation pretreatment to investigate the regulation of cake layer 3d structures by coagulation pretreatment and the related influence on water channels and uf filtration behavior cake layers formed during the uf process with and without coagulation at ph 7 were independently analyzed using tof sims based on the determined representative secondary ions of each fouling matter in our previous study wu et al 2021 compared with the clean uf membrane si figure s1 si figure s2a shows that the cake layer was formed by the ha bsa mixture and the cake layer structure was isotropic during the uf process without coagulation however the cake layer formed by the ha sa mixture had a sandwich like three layer structure fig 1a and ha of different mws was independently distributed si figure s3a similar phenomena were also found in our previous study wu et al 2021 see si text s2 for a detailed discussion however when the coagulation pretreatment was conducted using alcl3 2 7 mg al l at ph 7 during the coagulation uf process cake layers formed by ha bsa and ha sa mixtures were both isotropic fig 1a and si figures s2b and s4 notably the sandwich like structure of the cake layer was ruptured by coagulation pretreatment for the ha sa mixture and an isotropic distribution of ha sa within the floc layer was observed ha of different mws was also uniformly distributed within the floc layer si figure s3b a visualization of the variation in the cake layer 3d structure is shown in fig 1b the formation mechanism of the isotropic cake layer structure is probably that almost all the ha bsa and sa molecules were transformed into large size flocs mainly by charge neutralization with different aluminum species and by adsorption sweep flocculation with metal hydroxide precipitates zhao et al 2008 the floc morphology was similar and the adsorption of ha bsa or sa molecules nanoscale on flocs microscale were random during the subsequent uf process large size flocs were deposited onto the membrane surface leading to the random distribution of ha bsa and sa molecules within the cake layer as a result isotropic cake layer was formed when coagulation pretreatment was conducted particle size distribution analysis further verified the above inference for the ha sa mixture si figure s5a the particle size of the free ha sa was approximately 72 nm the relatively high values may be attributed to the molecular configuration of the linear chains however such free ha sa the peak at 72 nm was absent after the coagulation process at ph 7 2 7 mg al l alcl3 and flocs with a particle size of approximately 370 μm emerged the results were corroborated by gel permeation chromatography gpc analysis which showed that no residual ha and sa were detected after coagulation si figure s5b indicating that almost all ha and sa molecules were complexed and transformed into flocs because of the transformation of the cake layer 3d structure the water channels within the cake layer were enlarged in the sandwich like cake layer the void characteristics and matter densities in different layers differed leading to low connectivity between different layers however when the cake layer structure became isotropic the voids and matter density were uniform in the entire cake layer therefore the connectivity of voids was higher leading to larger water channels in addition when the coagulation pretreatment was conducted the large channels were formed due to the loose flocs long et al 2021 deposited onto the membrane surface the sem images show that the cake layer formed during the coagulation uf process possessed higher porosity 37 8 than that formed during the uf process without coagulation 3 1 fig 1c see si figure s6 for the sem image of clean uf membrane consequently uf filtration behavior was enhanced during the coagulation uf process fig 1d and si figure s7 the membrane specific fluxes filtration 60 min the same below unless specified were 0 62 for ha sa mixture and 0 77 for ha bsa mixture without coagulation during the direct uf process of ha bsa mixtures the adhesion of bsa molecules onto the membrane surface was largely reduced owing to the encapsulation of bsa molecules by ha molecules and the membrane fouling was similar to that caused by individual ha because the fouling potential of individual bsa molecules was larger than that of individual ha molecules wang et al 2013 the membrane fouling caused by ha bsa mixture was relatively slighter for direct uf process of ha sa mixtures membrane fouling caused by ha and sa were superimposed owing to the layered deposition and no mutual interaction between ha and sa molecules as a result severe membrane fouling was induced it has been discussed in detail in our previous study wu et al 2021 however when the coagulation pretreatment was conducted ha bsa and sa molecules were all complexed into similar flocs in the presence of sufficient dosage of coagulants as a result the membrane specific fluxes were improved to 0 93 for ha sa mixture and 0 91 for ha bsa mixture to confirm the cake layer regulation mechanism and the effect on uf filtration behavior during the long term operation 3 l and 5 l of ha sa mixtures were filtered with and without coagulation pretreatment the results showed that the cake layer structures were also transformed from layered structure into isotropic structure by coagulation pretreatment si figure s8 and the membrane specific fluxes were correspondingly improved si figure s9 these findings demonstrated that the cake layer 3d structures regulated by coagulation pretreatment were still effective in improving uf filtration behavior for long term uf operation in addition to the coagulation uf process the csuf process is also commonly applied in practical drinking water plants to comprehensively investigate the influence of coagulation pretreatment cake layer 3d structures formed during the csuf process at ph 7 alcl3 dosage 2 7 mg al l were also analyzed the ha sa mixture was used for further investigation because of the remarkable variation in the cake layer structure formed by the ha sa mixture fig 1a shows that the distribution of ha and sa within the floc layer remained isotropic when the sedimentation process 10 or 30 min had been used and no residual ha and sa was detected after the coagulation sedimentation process si figure s5b these phenomena indicated that both ha and sa molecules were complexed and transformed into flocs during the sedimentation process even though some large flocs were precipitated however the isotropy of cake layer structure was not improved and the porosity of cake layer was not enhanced after the sedimentation process 33 7 and 34 4 respectively fig 1c therefore the membrane specific fluxes during the csuf process were similar to those during the coagulation uf process fig 1d the coagulation uf process performed better in regulating cake layer 3d structures than that of the csuf process indicating coagulation playing a more important role compared to sedimentation 3 2 critical dosage of coagulants in regulating cake layer 3d structures the coagulant dosage significantly influences the subsequent uf performance wei et al 2009 therefore to reveal the potential mechanisms the effect on cake layer 3d structures and water channels was further investigated at ph 7 the coagulation uf process was conducted because of the limited effect of the additional sedimentation process fig 2a and si figure s10 shows that only if the dosage of alcl3 exceeded a critical value the cake layer formed by the ha sa mixture and flocs was regulated into an isotropic structure ha and sa were both uniformly distributed within the floc layer when the dosages reached 1 35 and 2 7 mg al l however at a low dosage 0 54 mg al l the cake layer remained a layered structure ha was primarily distributed at the bottom of the cake layer whereas sa was at the top correspondingly along with the increase in coagulant dosage from 0 54 to 2 7 mg al l water channels within the cake layer were enhanced because of the more isotropic structure the porosity of the cake layer si figure s11 was improved from 8 3 0 54 mg al l to 37 8 2 7 mg al l consequently the final membrane specific flux fig 2b was improved from 0 7 0 54 mg al l to 0 93 2 7 mg al l further analysis of the ha sa solution obtained after the coagulation process revealed the variation mechanisms of the cake layer structure with different coagulant dosages along with the increasing dosage of alcl3 the turbidity of ha sa solution increased from 0 52 without coagulant to 0 92 0 54 mg al l and then to 2 19 ntu 2 7 mg al l reflecting the increasing density of flocs fig 2c more ha and sa molecules were complexed and transformed into flocs at higher coagulant dosages the analysis of particle size distribution fig 2d during coagulation further shows that when the dosage was 0 54 mg al l few flocs with a particle size of approximately 38 μm were observed and many free ha and sa molecules remained a peak at 56 nm further gpc analysis confirmed that residual ha and sa were still present after coagulation at a dosage of 0 54 mg al l fig 2e the residual ha and sa molecules which were not complexed remained asynchronously deposited on the membrane surface leading to a layered cake layer however when the dosage was increased to 2 7 mg al l free ha and sa molecules were absent and large flocs were observed a peak at 370 μm fig 2d ha and sa molecules were complexed and synchronously deposited on the membrane surface leading to an isotropic cake layer with larger water channels 3 3 effect of solution ph on regulation of cake layer 3d structures solution ph is also a key factor in determining floc characteristics e g al speciation during coagulation judd and hillis 2001 which could influence the cake layer 3d structure during the subsequent uf process fig 3a and si figure s12 shows that along with the increasing ph the cake layer induced by ha sa and flocs alcl3 dosage 2 7 mg al l shifted from an isotropic structure ph 6 and 7 to a two layer structure ph 8 at ph 6 and 7 ha and sa were both uniformly distributed within the floc layer because ha and sa molecules were complexed during coagulation and synchronously deposited as the form of flocs during the uf process owing to the isotropic structure the water channels within the cake layer were large and the porosity of the cake layer was 41 1 at ph 6 si figure s13 consequently the final membrane specific flux reached 0 92 ph 6 fig 3b however when the ph increased to 8 the cake layer induced by ha sa and flocs was anisotropic more ha was distributed near the membrane surface visualization of the cake layer structural transformation is shown in fig 3c moreover the final membrane specific flux declined by 23 9 compared to that at ph 6 fig 3b these changes can be explained by the reduced fraction or size of water channels within the cake layer owing to the less isotropic structure the porosity of the cake layer decreased to 21 4 si figure s13 the proportion of al13 al speciation largely decreases with the ph increase for alcl3 leading to the reduced ability for complexing nom zhao et al 2009 2008 further analysis of the turbidity and zeta potential of the ha sa solution after coagulation indicates the decline in the number of flocs along with increasing ph when the solution ph value increased from 6 to 8 the turbidity fig 4a was decreased from 2 2 ntu to 1 46 ntu and the zeta potential fig 4b varied from 0 17 mv to 32 1 mv therefore fewer nom molecules were complexed at ph 8 than at ph 6 or 7 analysis of the particle size distribution further showed that when the ph was increased from 6 to 8 the d50 of particles in the ha sa solution after coagulation was reduced from 444 μm to 76 μm in addition free ha and sa molecules were absent after coagulation at ph 6 and 7 the response peak of the ha sa molecules at 72 nm disappeared fig 4c however at ph 8 a response peak at 49 nm remained fig 4c indicating the presence of free nom molecules that were not complexed during coagulation after the coagulation at ph 8 the average size of free nom in the solution was reduced this was probably due to the removal of large molecular weight nom so that the remaining nom had smaller molecular weight which was further corroborated by the gpc analysis the gpc analysis showed that the free nom molecules at ph 8 were residual small mw ha 8349 da fig 4d additionally the concentration of residual small mw ha was further reduced in the uf permeate these results demonstrated that residual small mw ha molecules that were not complexed could cross the deposited floc layer during the uf process at ph 8 however some of them were intercepted by the uf membrane based on the above analysis a possible mechanism for the cake layer structure transformation with increasing ph was proposed when the ph value increased the al13 proportion largely decreased and the major al species gradually became al oh 4 duan and gregory 2003 small molecular weight ha was not complexed by al oh 4 during the coagulation at ph 8 during the subsequent uf process the flocs were deposited onto the membrane surface to form a floc based layer the small molecular weight ha molecules which were not complexed crossed the floc based layer and were deposited near the membrane surface as a result when the ph value increased to 8 ha molecules were enriched near the membrane surface and the isotropic cake layer found at lower ph value was transformed into a two layer structure 3 4 regulation of cake layer 3d structures using high al13 concentration pacl al13 is the key speciation of al based coagulants for adsorbing and capturing nom molecules during coagulation duan et al 2014 the pacl which is also widely applied in practical coagulation pretreatment processes has a high proportion of al13 under a wide ph range e g 30 at ph 4 8 zhao et al 2009 therefore to confirm the key role of al13 in regulating the cake layer into an isotropic structure with more water channels the coagulation uf process was also conducted using the high al13 concentration pacl under different ph conditions pacl dosage 2 7 mg al l fig 5a and si figure s14 shows that the cake layers induced by ha sa and flocs were always isotropic at ph 6 7 and 8 when the coagulation pretreatment was performed using the high al13 concentration pacl which differed from the scenario in which alcl3 was used section 3 3 owing to the high al13 concentration in pacl both ha and sa molecules were easily complexed at ph 6 8 the turbidity of the ha sa solution after the coagulation process using pacl was always high 2 69 0 02 ntu indicating that a large number of flocs were present at ph 6 7 and 8 si figure s15 moreover the particle size distribution in the ha sa solution demonstrated that large flocs were formed 710 μm at ph 6 484 μm at ph 7 and 290 μm at ph 8 and free ha sa molecules were absent the response peak of ha sa molecules at 72 nm disappeared after the coagulation process using pacl at ph 6 8 fig 5b during the subsequent uf process the complexed ha and sa molecules were synchronously deposited as the form of flocs on the membrane surface and an isotropic cake layer was formed at ph 6 8 owing to the isotropic structure with large water channels the porosities of the cake layers si figure s16 reached 37 4 ph 6 32 6 ph 7 and 35 3 ph 8 the final membrane specific flux fig 5c was also improved to 0 94 ph 6 0 93 ph 7 and 0 91 ph 8 3 5 computational investigation of water transport within different cake layers the al13 concentration played a key role in regulating the 3d structure of the cake layer to further investigate its effect on the water channel characteristics and water transport behavior within the cake layers md simulations of the water transport were conducted because the actual water transport process within the cake layers induced by ha and sa during the coagulation uf process was difficult to accurately model and simulate it was simplified to water molecule transport within the water ha sa al13 systems with different al13 concentrations in these systems al13 molecules were coordinated with ha and sa chains wang et al 2017 and the coordination structures of al13 molecules and ha sa chains were mixed with water molecules at 2 45 0 05 mass percentage in addition for the high al13 concentration system the mass percentage of al13 was 22 6 whereas it was 6 2 for the low al13 concentration system the initial md models of these systems are shown in fig 6a and 6b free volume distribution and water transport md simulations were performed based on these models the free volume voids in different systems during the md simulation is shown in fig 6c and 6d and the connected free volume contributes to the water channels the fraction of free volume in the high al13 concentration system was higher than that in the low al13 concentration system moreover the connectivity of the free volume was stronger in the high a13 system facilitating larger and more connected water channels the highly connected water channels in the high al13 concentration system contributed to rapid water transport the mean square displacement msd of water molecules fig 6e during the 80 ps simulation was 43 8 å in the high al13 concentration system which was 35 6 higher than that in the low al13 concentration system furthermore the transport coefficient of water molecules reached 9 66 10 9 m2 s 1 in the high al13 concentration system which was improved by 54 1 in comparison with that in the low al13 concentration system si table s2 3 6 regulation of cake layer 3d structures formed by raw water to evaluate the practical value of the transformation of the cake layer 3d structure induced by coagulation pretreatment raw water collected from the beijing section of the south to north water diversion project china was used the detailed characteristics are listed in si table s1 the cake layer caused by raw water during the uf process without coagulation was isotropic because the aggregation between nom molecules occurred through ca2 bridges liu et al 2016 and the cake layer remained isotropic when the coagulation pretreatment was conducted alcl3 2 7 mg al l ph 7 si figure s17 to further investigate the variation in the cake layer structure induced by coagulation pretreatment raw water with ca2 removed was used as the feed water see si table s1 for detailed characteristics the ca2 concentration was as low as 0 5 0 1 mg l fig 7a shows that during the uf process without coagulation the cake layer formed by the raw water with ca2 removed was a layered structure hs and proteins were distributed more at the bottom of the cake layer and polysaccharides were distributed more at the top however when coagulation pretreatment alcl3 2 7 mg al l ph 7 was conducted the cake layer became isotropic fig 7b and si figure s18 the hs proteins and polysaccharides were uniformly distributed within the floc layer these results are consistent with the above observations for the model foulant system section 3 1 the findings above demonstrated the benefit of ca2 in cake layer regulation toward isotropic structure by coagulation pretreatment in the practical drinking water treatment the ca2 concentration may influence the coagulant dosage which is likely lower when ca2 concentration is higher the transformation of the cake layer structure induced by coagulation pretreatment is illustrated in fig 7c correspondingly the water channels within the cake layer were enhanced the porosity of the cake layer caused by raw water with ca2 removed was improved from 6 6 during the uf process without coagulation to 40 8 during the coagulation uf process fig 7d therefore the final membrane specific flux filtration for 3 h was enhanced from 0 69 to 0 79 fig 7e although the filtration time increased these findings were further corroborated with the above observation section 3 1 therefore we speculate that a more isotropic cake layer 3d structure regulated by coagulation pretreatment which has larger water channels should be also effective in improving uf filtration behavior for a long term uf operation it should be noted however further studies are necessary to analyze the cake layer 3d structures in practical water treatment plants because the uf behaviors can be influenced by many different factors in actual uf based water treatment e g membrane cleaning turbidity nom compositions and concentrations 4 conclusions in this study the variation in cake layer 3d structures and water channels induced by al based coagulation pretreatment was analyzed at micro nanoscale in addition its influence on water transport behavior and fluxes was elucidated the cake layer can be regulated into a more isotropic 3d structure by coagulation pretreatment which contributes to higher uf fluxes the coagulation process plays a key role in regulating the cake layer 3d structure and the sedimentation process has a limited effect when the coagulant dosage is adequate moreover a critical value was observed indicating that the dosage should be sufficiently high to form an isotropic structure the critical dosage changes according to the feed water quality furthermore the cake layer was more easily regulated into an isotropic structure by coagulation pretreatment using high al13 concentration coagulants either alcl3 at low ph or pacl in comparison with that obtained using low al13 concentration coagulants alcl3 at high ph when using coagulants with higher al13 concentrations the water channels within the cake layer were larger and more connected and the water transport was faster facilitating a higher uf efficiency for water purification these findings provided further explanation for mechanisms of better performance of higher al13 concentration coagulants in optimizing uf behavior additionally the guidance was given for the precise construction of coagulation pretreatments in the practical uf based purification of common weakly alkaline ph 8 surface water to scientifically regulate the cake layer 3d structure and improve uf efficiency declaration of competing interest the

14831,the variation in cake layer three dimensional 3d structures and related water channel characteristics induced by coagulation pretreatment remains unclear however gaining such knowledge will aid in improving ultrafiltration uf efficiency for water purification herein the regulation of cake layer 3d structures 3d distribution of organic foulants within cake layers by al based coagulation pretreatment was analyzed at the micro nanoscale the sandwich like cake layer of humic acids and sodium alginate induced without coagulation was ruptured and foulants were gradually uniformly distributed within the floc layer toward an isotropic structure with increasing coagulant dosage a critical dosage was observed furthermore the structure of the foulant floc layer was more isotropic when coagulants with high al13 concentrations were used either alcl3 at ph 6 or polyaluminum chloride in comparison with alcl3 at ph 8 where small molecular weight humic acids were enriched near the membrane these high al13 concentrations lead to a 48 4 higher specific membrane flux than that seen for uf without coagulation molecular dynamics simulations revealed that with increasing al13 concentration al13 6 2 to 22 6 the water channels within the cake layer were enlarged and more connected and the water transport coefficient was improved by up to 54 1 indicating faster water transport these findings demonstrate that facilitating an isotropic foulant floc layer with highly connected water channels by coagulation pretreatment with high al13 concentration coagulants having a strong ability to complex organic foulants is the key issue in optimizing the uf efficiency for water purification the results should provide further understanding of the underlying mechanisms of coagulation enhancing uf behavior and inspire precise design of coagulation pretreatment to achieve efficient uf graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords drinking water ultrafiltration

et al 2018 yu and zhang 2019 zhang et al 2003 cake layer formation gradually becomes the predominant fouling mechanism for uf membranes in long term operation even causing higher than 90 additional energy and costs she et al 2009 during long term operation in drinking water treatment cake layers caused by natural organic matter nom primarily composed of humic substances hs followed by polysaccharides and proteins kennedy et al 2005 zhao et al 2021 gradually become the key factor governing uf membrane fouling taniguchi et al 2003 wang et al 2013 zhang et al 2013 the characteristics of the cake layers exert a significant influence on the water channels and related water transport properties within the cake layers resulting in different uf behaviors e g flux amjad et al 2015 wang and waite 2008 for instance the uf flux has been improved by reducing the compactness sun et al 2018 wang and tang 2011 and thickness lee et al 2005 of the cake layer in addition to the characteristics of the whole cake layer the three dimensional 3d structure of the cake layer that is the 3d spatial distribution of foulants within the cake layer plays a crucial role wu et al 2021 the 3d structure of the cake layer is related to the 3d distribution of matter density in a nanoscale analog the polyamide density 3d distribution in reverse osmosis membranes influences their water channel characteristics e g the proportion and connectivity culp et al 2021 additionally variations in the cake layer 3d structure can contribute to changes in the 3d distribution of functional groups leading to different interactions with water which is transported through the cake layer these distinct water channels induced by different cake layer 3d structures can facilitate the variation in water transport efficiency and related uf water flux therefore scientifically regulating the 3d structure of the cake layer should be an effective strategy to improve uf efficiency for water purification however in depth insights into the cake layer 3d structure and water channels remain insufficient owing to the lack of proper characterization technologies leading to limited guidance for the tailored regulation of cake layers recently many types of pretreatments have been applied to regulate cake layers huang et al 2009 such as oxidation cheng et al 2018 adsorption malczewska and benjamin 2016 and sand filtration ferrer et al 2015 aiming to mitigate membrane fouling and improve uf efficiency coagulation is the most common pretreatment used in practical drinking water treatment plants because of its simple operation and low maintenance choi and dempsey 2004 the cake layer regulation using al based coagulants has been widely investigated owing to its strong ability to aggregate nom through charge neutralization and sweep flocculation konieczny et al 2009 mao et al 2013 wang et al 2002 zhou and meng 2016 however previous studies have primarily focused on the transformation of the macro characteristics of cake layers such as looseness and thickness feng et al 2015 masmoudi et al 2016 the variation in cake layer 3d structures and water channels within cake layers are less clarified owing to the limitation of characterization technologies whereas it is the key factor influencing water transport efficiency and uf behavior therefore the mechanisms underlying coagulation enhancing uf behavior are still not comprehensively understood clarifying the transformation of cake layer 3d structures and related water channel characteristics induced by coagulation pretreatment is vital and could provide a theoretical basis for the development of efficient coagulation uf processes traditional characterization approaches such as optical coherence

speciation polyaluminum chloride pacl high concentration of al13 were further investigated molecular dynamics md simulations were conducted to clarify the variation in water channel characteristics and water transport behavior humic acid ha bovine serum albumin bsa and sodium alginate sa were used as the representations of hs polysaccharides and proteins respectively to investigate cake layers

used as the feed water 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the information of reagents uf membranes and raw water is provided in supporting information si method s1 the characteristics of raw water

the coagulation uf process coagulation pretreatment was conducted before filtration after coagulation 300 ml of the feed solution was filtered directly for the coagulation sedimentation uf csuf

regulation of cake layer 3d structures by al based coagulation pretreatment to investigate the regulation of cake layer 3d structures by coagulation pretreatment and the related influence on water channels and uf filtration behavior cake layers formed during the uf process with and without coagulation at ph 7 were independently analyzed using tof sims based on the determined representative secondary ions of each fouling matter in our previous study wu et al 2021 compared with the clean uf membrane si figure s1 si figure s2a shows that the cake layer was formed by the ha bsa mixture and the cake layer structure was isotropic during the uf process without coagulation however the cake layer formed by the ha sa mixture had a sandwich like three layer structure fig 1a and ha of different mws was independently distributed si figure s3a similar phenomena were also found in our previous study wu et al 2021 see si text s2 for a detailed discussion however when the coagulation pretreatment was conducted using alcl3 2 7 mg al l at ph 7 during the coagulation uf process cake layers formed by ha bsa and ha sa mixtures were both isotropic fig 1a and si figures s2b and s4 notably the sandwich like structure of the cake layer was ruptured by coagulation pretreatment for the ha sa mixture and an isotropic distribution of ha sa within the floc layer was observed ha of different mws was also uniformly distributed within the floc layer si figure s3b a visualization of the variation in the cake layer 3d structure is shown in fig 1b the formation mechanism of the isotropic cake layer structure is probably that almost all the ha bsa and sa molecules were transformed into large size flocs mainly by charge neutralization with different aluminum species and by adsorption sweep flocculation with metal hydroxide precipitates zhao et al 2008 the floc morphology was similar and the adsorption of ha bsa or sa molecules nanoscale on flocs microscale were random during the subsequent uf process large size flocs were deposited onto the membrane surface leading to the random distribution of ha bsa and sa molecules within the cake layer as a result isotropic cake layer was formed when coagulation pretreatment was conducted particle size distribution analysis further verified the above inference for the ha sa mixture si figure s5a the particle size of the free ha sa was approximately 72 nm the relatively high values may be attributed to the molecular configuration of the linear chains however such free ha sa the peak at 72 nm was absent after the coagulation process at ph 7 2 7 mg al l alcl3 and flocs with a particle size of approximately 370 μm emerged the results were corroborated by gel permeation chromatography gpc analysis which showed that no residual ha and sa were detected after coagulation si figure s5b indicating that almost all ha and sa molecules were complexed and transformed into flocs because of the transformation of the cake layer 3d structure the water channels within the cake layer were enlarged in the sandwich like cake layer the void characteristics and matter densities in different layers differed leading to low connectivity between different layers however when the cake layer structure became isotropic the voids and matter density were uniform in the entire cake layer therefore the connectivity of voids was higher leading to larger water channels in addition when the coagulation pretreatment was conducted the large channels were formed due to the loose flocs long et al 2021 deposited onto the membrane surface the sem images show that the cake layer formed during the coagulation uf process possessed higher porosity 37 8 than that formed during the uf process without coagulation 3 1 fig 1c see si figure s6 for the sem image of clean uf membrane consequently uf filtration behavior was enhanced during the coagulation uf process fig 1d and si figure s7 the membrane specific fluxes filtration 60 min the same below unless specified were 0 62 for ha sa mixture and 0 77 for ha bsa mixture without coagulation during the direct uf process of ha bsa mixtures the adhesion of bsa molecules onto the membrane surface was largely reduced owing to the encapsulation of bsa molecules by ha molecules and the membrane fouling was similar to that caused by individual ha because the fouling potential of individual bsa molecules was larger than that of individual ha molecules wang et al 2013 the membrane fouling caused by ha bsa mixture was relatively slighter for direct uf process of ha sa mixtures membrane fouling caused by ha and sa were superimposed owing to the layered deposition and no mutual interaction between ha and sa molecules as a result severe membrane fouling was induced it has been discussed in detail in our previous study wu et al 2021 however when the coagulation pretreatment was conducted ha bsa and sa molecules were all complexed into similar flocs in the presence of sufficient dosage of coagulants as a result the membrane specific fluxes were improved to 0 93 for ha sa mixture and 0 91 for ha bsa mixture to confirm the cake layer regulation mechanism and the effect on uf filtration behavior during the long term operation 3 l and 5 l of ha sa mixtures were filtered with and without coagulation pretreatment the results showed that the cake layer structures were also transformed from layered structure into isotropic structure by coagulation pretreatment si figure s8 and the membrane specific fluxes were correspondingly improved si figure s9 these findings demonstrated that the cake layer 3d structures regulated by coagulation pretreatment were still effective in improving uf filtration behavior for long term uf operation in addition to the coagulation uf process the csuf process is also commonly applied in practical drinking water plants to comprehensively investigate the influence of coagulation pretreatment cake layer 3d structures formed during the csuf process at ph 7 alcl3 dosage 2 7 mg al l were also analyzed the ha sa mixture was used for further investigation because of the remarkable variation in the cake layer structure formed by the ha sa mixture fig 1a shows that the distribution of ha and sa within the floc layer remained isotropic when the sedimentation process 10 or 30 min had been used and no residual ha and sa was detected after the coagulation sedimentation process si figure s5b these phenomena indicated that both ha and sa molecules were complexed and transformed into flocs during the sedimentation process even though some large flocs were precipitated however the isotropy of cake layer structure was not improved and the porosity of cake layer was not enhanced after the sedimentation process 33 7 and 34 4 respectively fig 1c therefore the membrane specific fluxes during the csuf process were similar to those during the coagulation uf process fig 1d the coagulation uf process performed better in regulating cake layer 3d structures than that of the csuf process indicating coagulation playing a more important role compared to sedimentation 3 2 critical dosage of coagulants in regulating cake layer 3d structures the coagulant dosage significantly influences the subsequent uf performance wei et al 2009 therefore to reveal the potential mechanisms the effect on cake layer 3d structures and water channels was further investigated at ph 7 the coagulation uf process was conducted because of the limited effect of the additional sedimentation process fig 2a and si figure s10 shows that only if the dosage of alcl3 exceeded a critical value the cake layer formed by the ha sa mixture and flocs was regulated into an isotropic structure ha and sa were both uniformly distributed within the floc layer when the dosages reached 1 35 and 2 7 mg al l however at a low dosage 0 54 mg al l the cake layer remained a layered structure ha was primarily distributed at the bottom of the cake layer whereas sa was at the top correspondingly along with the increase in coagulant dosage from 0 54 to 2 7 mg al l water channels within the cake layer were enhanced because of the more isotropic structure the porosity of the cake layer si figure s11 was improved from 8 3 0 54 mg al l to 37 8 2 7 mg al l consequently the final membrane specific flux fig 2b was improved from 0 7 0 54 mg al l to 0 93 2 7 mg al l further analysis of the ha sa solution obtained after the coagulation process revealed the variation mechanisms of the cake layer structure with different coagulant dosages along with the increasing dosage of alcl3 the turbidity of ha sa solution increased from 0 52 without coagulant to 0 92 0 54 mg al l and then to 2 19 ntu 2 7 mg al l reflecting the increasing density of flocs fig 2c more ha and sa molecules were complexed and transformed into flocs at higher coagulant dosages the analysis of particle size distribution fig 2d during coagulation further shows that when the dosage was 0 54 mg al l few flocs with a particle size of approximately 38 μm were observed and many free ha and sa molecules remained a peak at 56 nm further gpc analysis confirmed that residual ha and sa were still present after coagulation at a dosage of 0 54 mg al l fig 2e the residual ha and sa molecules which were not complexed remained asynchronously deposited on the membrane surface leading to a layered cake layer however when the dosage was increased to 2 7 mg al l free ha and sa molecules were absent and large flocs were observed a peak at 370 μm fig 2d ha and sa molecules were complexed and synchronously deposited on the membrane surface leading to an isotropic cake layer with larger water channels 3 3 effect of solution ph on regulation of cake layer 3d structures solution ph is also a key factor in determining floc characteristics e g al speciation during coagulation judd and hillis 2001 which could influence the cake layer 3d structure during the subsequent uf process fig 3a and si figure s12 shows that along with the increasing ph the cake layer induced by ha sa and flocs alcl3 dosage 2 7 mg al l shifted from an isotropic structure ph 6 and 7 to a two layer structure ph 8 at ph 6 and 7 ha and sa were both uniformly distributed within the floc layer because ha and sa molecules were complexed during coagulation and synchronously deposited as the form of flocs during the uf process owing to the isotropic structure the water channels within the cake layer were large and the porosity of the cake layer was 41 1 at ph 6 si figure s13 consequently the final membrane specific flux reached 0 92 ph 6 fig 3b however when the ph increased to 8 the cake layer induced by ha sa and flocs was anisotropic more ha was distributed near the membrane surface visualization of the cake layer structural transformation is shown in fig 3c moreover the final membrane specific flux declined by 23 9 compared to that at ph 6 fig 3b these changes can be explained by the reduced fraction or size of water channels within the cake layer owing to the less isotropic structure the porosity of the cake layer decreased to 21 4 si figure s13 the proportion of al13 al speciation largely decreases with the ph increase for alcl3 leading to the reduced ability for complexing nom zhao et al 2009 2008 further analysis of the turbidity and zeta potential of the ha sa solution after coagulation indicates the decline in the number of flocs along with increasing ph when the solution ph value increased from 6 to 8 the turbidity fig 4a was decreased from 2 2 ntu to 1 46 ntu and the zeta potential fig 4b varied from 0 17 mv to 32 1 mv therefore fewer nom molecules were complexed at ph 8 than at ph 6 or 7 analysis of the particle size distribution further showed that when the ph was increased from 6 to 8 the d50 of particles in the ha sa solution after coagulation was reduced from 444 μm to 76 μm in addition free ha and sa molecules were absent after coagulation at ph 6 and 7 the response peak of the ha sa molecules at 72 nm disappeared fig 4c however at ph 8 a response peak at 49 nm remained fig 4c indicating the presence of free nom molecules that were not complexed during coagulation after the coagulation at ph 8 the average size of free nom in the solution was reduced this was probably due to the removal of large molecular weight nom so that the remaining nom had smaller molecular weight which was further corroborated by the gpc analysis the gpc analysis showed that the free nom molecules at ph 8 were residual small mw ha 8349 da fig 4d additionally the concentration of residual small mw ha was further reduced in the uf permeate these results demonstrated that residual small mw ha molecules that were not complexed could cross the deposited floc layer during the uf process at ph 8 however some of them were intercepted by the uf membrane based on the above analysis a possible mechanism for the cake layer structure transformation with increasing ph was proposed when the ph value increased the al13 proportion largely decreased and the major al species gradually became al oh 4 duan and gregory 2003 small molecular weight ha was not complexed by al oh 4 during the coagulation at ph 8 during the subsequent uf process the flocs were deposited onto the membrane surface to form a floc based layer the small molecular weight ha molecules which were not complexed crossed the floc based layer and were deposited near the membrane surface as a result when the ph value increased to 8 ha molecules were enriched near the membrane surface and the isotropic cake layer found at lower ph value was transformed into a two layer structure 3 4 regulation of cake layer 3d structures using high al13 concentration pacl al13 is the key speciation of al based coagulants for adsorbing and capturing nom molecules during coagulation duan et al 2014 the pacl which is also widely applied in practical coagulation pretreatment processes has a high proportion of al13 under a wide ph range e g 30 at ph 4 8 zhao et al 2009 therefore to confirm the key role of al13 in regulating the cake layer into an isotropic structure with more water channels the coagulation uf process was also conducted using the high al13 concentration pacl under different ph conditions pacl dosage 2 7 mg al l fig 5a and si figure s14 shows that the cake layers induced by ha sa and flocs were always isotropic at ph 6 7 and 8 when the coagulation pretreatment was performed using the high al13 concentration pacl which differed from the scenario in which alcl3 was used section 3 3 owing to the high al13 concentration in pacl both ha and sa molecules were easily complexed at ph 6 8 the turbidity of the ha sa solution after the coagulation process using pacl was always high 2 69 0 02 ntu indicating that a large number of flocs were present at ph 6 7 and 8 si figure s15 moreover the particle size distribution in the ha sa solution demonstrated that large flocs were formed 710 μm at ph 6 484 μm at ph 7 and 290 μm at ph 8 and free ha sa molecules were absent the response peak of ha sa molecules at 72 nm disappeared after the coagulation process using pacl at ph 6 8 fig 5b during the subsequent uf process the complexed ha and sa molecules were synchronously deposited as the form of flocs on the membrane surface and an isotropic cake layer was formed at ph 6 8 owing to the isotropic structure with large water channels the porosities of the cake layers si figure s16 reached 37 4 ph 6 32 6 ph 7 and 35 3 ph 8 the final membrane specific flux fig 5c was also improved to 0 94 ph 6 0 93 ph 7 and 0 91 ph 8 3 5 computational investigation of water transport within different cake layers the al13 concentration played a key role in regulating the 3d structure of the cake layer to further investigate its effect on the water channel characteristics and water transport behavior within the cake layers md simulations of the water transport were conducted because the actual water transport process within the cake layers induced by ha and sa during the coagulation uf process was difficult to accurately model and simulate it was simplified to water molecule transport within the water ha sa al13 systems with different al13 concentrations in these systems al13 molecules were coordinated with ha and sa chains wang et al 2017 and the coordination structures of al13 molecules and ha sa chains were mixed with water molecules at 2 45 0 05 mass percentage in addition for the high al13 concentration system the mass percentage of al13 was 22 6 whereas it was 6 2 for the low al13 concentration system the initial md models of these systems are shown in fig 6a and 6b free volume distribution and water transport md simulations were performed based on these models the free volume voids in different systems during the md simulation is shown in fig 6c and 6d and the connected free volume contributes to the water channels the fraction of free volume in the high al13 concentration system was higher than that in the low al13 concentration system moreover the connectivity of the free volume was stronger in the high a13 system facilitating larger and more connected water channels the highly connected water channels in the high al13 concentration system contributed to rapid water transport the mean square displacement msd of water molecules fig 6e during the 80 ps simulation was 43 8 å in the high al13 concentration system which was 35 6 higher than that in the low al13 concentration system furthermore the transport coefficient of water molecules reached 9 66 10 9 m2 s 1 in the high al13 concentration system which was improved by 54 1 in comparison with that in the low al13 concentration system si table s2 3 6 regulation of cake layer 3d structures formed by raw water to evaluate the practical value of the transformation of the cake layer 3d structure induced by coagulation pretreatment raw water collected from the beijing section of the south to north water diversion project china was used the detailed characteristics are listed in si table s1 the cake layer caused by raw water during the uf process without coagulation was isotropic because the aggregation between nom molecules occurred through ca2 bridges liu et al 2016 and the cake layer remained isotropic when the coagulation pretreatment was conducted alcl3 2 7 mg al l ph 7 si figure s17 to further investigate the variation in the cake layer structure induced by coagulation pretreatment raw water with ca2 removed was used as the feed water see si table s1 for detailed characteristics the ca2 concentration was as low as 0 5 0 1 mg l fig 7a shows that during the uf process without coagulation the cake layer formed by the raw water with ca2 removed was a layered structure hs and proteins were distributed more at the bottom of the cake layer and polysaccharides were distributed more at the top however when coagulation pretreatment alcl3 2 7 mg al l ph 7 was conducted the cake layer became isotropic fig 7b and si figure s18 the hs proteins and polysaccharides were uniformly distributed within the floc layer these results are consistent with the above observations for the model foulant system section 3 1 the findings above demonstrated the benefit of ca2 in cake layer regulation toward isotropic structure by coagulation pretreatment in the practical drinking water treatment the ca2 concentration may influence the coagulant dosage which is likely lower when ca2 concentration is higher the transformation of the cake layer structure induced by coagulation pretreatment is illustrated in fig 7c correspondingly the water channels within the cake layer were enhanced the porosity of the cake layer caused by raw water with ca2 removed was improved from 6 6 during the uf process without coagulation to 40 8 during the coagulation uf process fig 7d therefore the final membrane specific flux filtration for 3 h was enhanced from 0 69 to 0 79 fig 7e although the filtration time increased these findings were further corroborated with the above observation section 3 1 therefore we speculate that a more isotropic cake layer 3d structure regulated by coagulation pretreatment which has larger water channels should be also effective in improving uf filtration behavior for a long term uf operation it should be noted however further studies are necessary to analyze the cake layer 3d structures in practical water treatment plants because the uf behaviors can be influenced by many different factors in actual uf based water treatment e g membrane cleaning turbidity nom compositions and concentrations 4 conclusions in this study the variation in cake layer 3d structures and water channels induced by al based coagulation pretreatment was analyzed at micro nanoscale in addition its influence on water transport behavior and fluxes was elucidated the cake layer can be regulated into a more isotropic 3d structure by coagulation pretreatment which contributes to higher uf fluxes the coagulation process plays a key role in regulating the cake layer 3d structure and the sedimentation process has a limited effect when the coagulant dosage is adequate moreover a critical value was observed indicating that the dosage should be sufficiently high to form an isotropic structure the critical dosage changes according to the feed water quality furthermore the cake layer was more easily regulated into an isotropic structure by coagulation pretreatment using high al13 concentration coagulants either alcl3 at low ph or pacl in comparison with that obtained using low al13 concentration coagulants alcl3 at high ph when using coagulants with higher al13 concentrations the water channels within the cake layer were larger and more connected and the water transport was faster facilitating a higher uf efficiency for water purification these findings provided further explanation for mechanisms of better performance of higher al13 concentration coagulants in optimizing uf behavior additionally the guidance was given for the precise construction of coagulation pretreatments in the practical uf based purification of common weakly alkaline ph 8 surface water to scientifically regulate the cake layer 3d structure and improve uf efficiency declaration of competing interest the

request 1 introduction with accelerated urbanization and industrialization the number of waste water treatment plants wwtps worldwide is increasing annually as a byproduct of sewage treatment waste activated sludge was has the dual properties of being both a pollutant and a resource and its disposal has become an emerging issue anaerobic digestion ad is an effective technology to realize the reduction and reduce harm from organic solid waste as well as for resource recovery however the relatively low bioconversion efficiency and high operational costs of ad limit its large scale industrial application xu et al 2020 zhang and li 2019 the use of a mathematical model to simulate the methane production in the ad system could help to optimize the operation and improve digestion efficiency adm1 is a commonly used model that describes ad batstone et al 2002b and has been typically modified to simulate methane production on various types of organic substrates jimenez et al 2020 mottet et al 2013 song et al 2018 the organic composition of substrates can affect the ad process the properties of sludge vary widely from country to country and region to region fisgativa et al 2018 investigated the fractions and corresponding methanogenic potential of sludge in different wwtps in france and found that inorganic fractions accounted for approximately 20 and organic fractions primarily consisted of proteins major components in secondary sludge carbohydrates major components in primary sludge and a small number of lipids wilén et al 2003 studied the components of sludge in australia and found that protein accounted for over 43 followed by humus 15 42 carbohydrates 10 18 and inorganic matter 20 however the inorganic fraction of was is much higher up to approximately 50 in china duan et al 2016 zhang and li 2019 gonzalez et al 2018 found that the percentages of the different components also varied remarkably in different sludge sources in general proteins accounted for 40 60 humic substances accounted for 10 30 carbohydrates accounted for 10 20 and the other constituents were less than 10 of the sludge substrate carbohydrates proteins and lipids as major components of sludge have different methanogenic potentials xue et al 2020 and their contents vary in different was in the original adm1 the recommended fractions of sludge components are 0 3 0 3 0 3 and 0 1 for the particulate proteins x pr carbohydrates x ch lipids x li and particulate inert material xi batstone et al 2002a which ignored the variability among different sludge substrates this may

li and rescale their proportions to accurately predict the resource or energy recovery potential of was currently several available methods are utilized to determine the primary organic matter in the substrate of adm1 i the methane production rate mpr curve measured by anaerobic respiration is used to divide the fraction of the particulate substrate girault et al 2012 ii the protein content is estimated using the organic nitrogen content multiplied by the conversion factor 6 25 and the lipid content is determined using soxhlet extraction finally the chemical oxygen demand cod proportion of carbohydrates is determined to be carbohydrates 100 100 proteins 100 lipids 100 fisgativa et al 2020 iii the contents of the organic components in sludge are measured using coupling sequential extraction and spectrophotometric or 3d fluorescence spectroscopy muller et al 2014 iv low field 1h nuclear magnetic resonance lf 1h nmr is primarily used in the field of food science for the detection of lipids moistures and moisture form bertram et al 2004 zhang et al 2018 v the weender analysis method uses nitrogen content multiplied by 6 25 to obtain protein content alkaline extraction to obtain carbohydrate crude fiber content and ether leaching to obtain crude lipid content to characterize different substrates for biogas production peters et al 2018 collectively the existing methods are complex due to their extraction and crushing processes are error prone time consuming and require large amounts of chemicals therefore a quick quantification method is required to identify the major organic components in sludge and to realize the accurate fractionation of sludge substrate in adm1 various instrumental analyses have been developed in recent years which have been gradually applied to characterize and semi quantify complex substances for example fourier transform infrared ftir and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps have been widely used to study the properties and composition of organic matters in extracellular polymeric substances eps and other substances badireddy et al 2010 2008 zhang et al 2019 in recent years lf 1h nmr was first used for the detection of the moisture status and lipid content in sludge dong et al 2021 wu et al 2019 reports have shown that the lipid peak may well be separated using the spin spin relaxation t2 time hickey et al 2006 as a type of solid waste sludge components are complex and difficult to distinguish therefore instrumental methods have not been comprehensively used to quantify the organic fractions of sludge the instrumental analytical methods mentioned above are universal and accessible and can provide potential prospective applications for the rapid qualitative and quantitative determination of the primary organic matter in solid waste adm1 includes seven types of microbial degraders that are responsible for the degradation of amino acids sugars long chain fatty acids lcfas butyrate and valerate propionate acetate and hydrogen the microbial diversity among degraders of the same functional group has been described in the literature by extending the adm1 from seven biomass species seven functional groups one species per functional group to 70 different biomass species seven functional groups 10 species per functional group ramirez et al 2009 jablonski and lukaszewicz 2014 combined the adm1 with anaerobic activity tests to estimate the structure of microbial communities in methanogenic digesters in the above studies the initial concentrations of the seven degraders were all the same in the original default state of the adm1 and this deviated from the actual situation of the ad however a quantitative method for the initial microbial fractions of the model remains lacking with the development of molecular biology the relative abundance of the primary microorganisms in sludge can be determined using a 16s rrna gene sequence analysis that provides a potential method for the identification of different microbial proportions the overall goal of this study is to develop a practical methodology to determine the major initial components of the adm1 to improve the fit of the adm1 for the better simulation of the methane production process the existing instrumental methods ftir xps and nmr are integrated to achieve the rapid determination of the major organic fractions proteins carbohydrates and lipids of sludge and a 16s rrna gene sequence analysis is utilized to determine the initial fractions of the model microorganisms the kinetic parameters in the adm1 were calibrated based on batch experiments this study provides a novel method for the quick determination of the initial organic and microbial components of adm1 using a modern instrumental analysis 2 material and methods 2 1 was properties four types of was samples were collected from the secondary sedimentation tanks of different wwtps in which three samples were obtained from wwtps with anaerobic anoxic oxic aao treatment processes and one sample was collected from a lab scale aao reactor these samples were named wwtp s1 wwtp s2 wwtp s3 lab s4 the description of the wwtps is provided in table s1 after being collected from the wwtps the sludge samples were transported to the laboratory immediately they were then screened to remove coarse particles and the sludge properties were determined as soon as possible the average characteristics of these four was samples are shown in table 1 the ph was approximately 6 5 and the volatile suspended solids vss total suspended solids tss ratio of the sludge from the three wwtps was in the range of 55 0 65 0 meaning that the ash content was 35 0 45 0 the initial concentration of ammonia nitrogen was approximately 10 0 mg l lab s4 had the highest organic content distinguishing it from the other three types of sludge from the full scale wwtps this was because lab s4 was derived from the aao reactor fed with synthetic domestic wastewater in the laboratory one liter of pre treated sludge was centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 10 min to discard the supernatant the sludge pellet obtained from the centrifugation was freeze dried and ground into powder for sludge fractionation the remaining sludge was temporarily stored in a refrigerator at 4 c for the ad experiments 2 2 fractionation of the organic substrates in the was 2 2 1 instrumental analysis using ftir xps and nmr an ftir analysis was used to identify the main organic matters in the sludge and xps and nmr were used to quantify the contents of these major organic matters an ftir spectrophotometer was applied to explore the functional groups of the was the spectra were recorded using an ftir spectrometer nicolet 5700 thermo electron corporation usa in the range of 4000 400 cm 1 with a resolution of 4 cm 1 xps thermo scientific k alpha usa was utilized to estimate the elemental composition of the sludge and to assess the functionalities associated with the elements of carbon oxygen and nitrogen using the advantage software the dry sludge samples were subjected to a t2 measurement using lf nmr mesomr23 060h i nmr system niumag electric corporation china that was equipped with a 0 5 t permanent magnet corresponding to a proton resonance frequency of 23 2 mhz at 32 c the c spectrum distribution curve of the sludge was drawn using the 13c nmr analysis and the peak positions of the carbon atoms of the corresponding functional groups were determined by comparing the pure protein casein and carbohydrates dextrose substances at the same time the c spectra measurements of the was casein and dextran were performed using nmr bruker 400 mhz germany with a cycle delay of 2 s a mass rotation rate of 5 khz and a contact pulse of 2 ms the instrumental analytical methods are detailed in the supplementary material supporting methods s1 s4 2 2 2 sequential extraction procedure and analysis of extracts a sequential extraction approach was utilized to correlate the bioavailability of the organic matter in the sludge with chemical extractability the sequential extraction was a modification of the method reported by jimenez et al 2014 instead of strong acid extraction ultrasound was used to extract a portion of the intracellular protein and carbohydrate in this modified method to obtain the sludge extracts without destroying the original organic structure of the sludge as much as possible the major extracts were as follows dissolved organic matter dom obtained by centrifugation 8000 rpm 10 min 4 c and filtration at 0 45 µm soluble eps s eps obtained by washing the remaining particles with a neutral saline solution loosely bound eps lb eps obtained by saline alkali 0 01 mol l nacl 0 01 mol l naoh extraction tightly bound eps tb eps obtained by a strong alkaline 0 1 mol l naoh extraction and the extraction of cellular material obtained using a strong alkaline 0 1 mol l naoh extraction in a sonication environment the cod of the extracts and the cod of the remaining non extractable fraction ne cod were also determined the cod of the total extractable fraction te cod was obtained by summing the cod of the above five extracts 2 2 3 3d excitation emission matrix fluorescence spectroscopy parallel factor analysis the 3d excitation emission matrix 3d eem fluorescence spectra were measured using a cary eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer agilent technologies usa to analyze the fluorescence components the excitation wavelengths varied from 200 to 550 nm with increments of 10 nm while the emission wavelengths varied from 200 to 550 nm the slit widths of the emission and excitation monochromators were fixed at 5 nm the scanning monochromator speed was approximately 1200 nm min 1 the fluorescence values were recorded every 0 5 nm between 200 and 600 nm the approach of the parallel factor parafac modeling of eems can provide both quantitative and qualitative models of the eem data and statistically decompose the complex fluorescence signal stedmon and bro 2008 despite the complex nature of the samples the extracted fluorophores represent a group of organic compounds with similar fluorescence properties the maximum fluorescence intensity fmax of each component has been widely used to estimate the relative concentration of each component murphy et al 2011 stedmon and bro 2008 therefore the fmax of each parafac component was used to demonstrate the quantitative and qualitative differences among samples to obtain a better understanding of the organic extraction of sludge zhang et al 2016 a series of parafac models with three to seven components were generated a residual analysis spectral properties examination split half analysis and random initialization were utilized for the model validation stedmon and bro 2008 2 3 microbial diversity based on the 16s rrna gene sequence analysis for the initial microbial fractionation of sludge the sludge samples were stored at 80 c and analyzed for the microbial diversity of bacteria and archaea using a 16s rrna gene sequence analysis the relative abundance of the major bacteria was analyzed at the phylum and family levels and the archaea were analyzed at the genus levels the total microbial genomic dna was extracted from sludge samples using the e z n a soil dna kit omega bio tek norcross ga u s according to the manufacturer s instructions the primer sets of bacteria were 338f 5 actcctacgggaggcagca 3 and 806r 5 ggactachvgggtwtctaat 3 to amplify the v3 v4 variable regions of the 16s rrna gene ping et al 2022 the primer set for archaea was 524f10extf tgycagccgccgcggtaa and arch958rmodr yccggcgttgavtccaatt to amplify the v4 v5 variable region of the gene the purified amplicons were pooled in equimolar amounts and paired end sequenced on an illumina miseq pe300 platform illumina san diego usa according to the standard protocols by majorbio bio pharm technology co ltd shanghai china the raw sequencing reads were deposited into the national center for biotechnology information ncbi sequence read archive sra database the method of 16s rrna gene sequence analysis is detailed in the supplementary material supporting method s5 2 4 batch anaerobic digestion experiment the ad experiment was conducted in 600 ml serum bottles that were placed in a shaker 35 1 c 275 rpm with three parallel samples each bottle contained 500 ml of raw sludge that had been retrieved and stored at 4 c for less than 24 h with a headspace volume of 100 ml nitrogen blowing was conducted for 5 min prior to the experiment to ensure anaerobic condition the ad experiments were run for 47 d until the performance of the digestion reached a steady state sampling was undertaken every two days to determine the cod volatile fatty acids vfas nh4 protein and carbohydrate methane production and ph changes during the ad process were monitored simultaneously after ad some of the sludge samples were stored frozen in a refrigerator at 80 c for the subsequent microbial diversity analysis 2 5 analysis of the sludge characteristics and the ad products a portable 6010 m ph meter jenco usa was used to measure the ph of the sludge the soluble carbohydrates and proteins were analyzed following the anthrone method trevelyan et al 1952 and the lowry folin method lowry et al 1951 respectively the tss vss total chemical oxygen demand

equations the adm1 for the was included two extracellular steps disintegration and hydrolysis and three intracellular steps acidogenesis or fermentation acetogenesis and methanogenesis the kinetic equations employed for all of the biochemical processes in adm1 are summarized in table s2 all extracellular steps were assumed to be first order kinetics and this was a simplification based on empiricism the xc was first disintegrated into x ch x pr and x li as well as xi and si this disintegration process was described by a disintegration coefficient kdis then the x ch x pr and x li substrates were further hydrolyzed to amino acids sugars and lcfas respectively and the corresponding hydrolytic coefficients were khyd pr khyd ch and khyd li respectively monod type kinetics for the substrate uptake are used as the basis for all intracellular biochemical reactions batstone et al 2002b biomass growth is implicit in substrate uptake the decay of biomass was represented by first order kinetics and the dead biomass was maintained in the system and became part of the composite particulate material 2 7 modeling approach of the methane production the modeling and simulation were conducted using the west software mikebydhi com a separate anaerobic digester was established in the adm1 and its digestate volume v liq and gas volume v gas were established according to the actual laboratory ad volume and headspace volume the mode of the model was set at 1 mode 1 to simulate the ad process under unregulated ph conditions most of the initial concentrations of the substrates and initial ph were directly obtained from the experimental measurements and input into the anaerobic digester of the model the relevant metrics that needed to be simulated for output were set and these included the gas production the partial pressure of methane ph concentrations of the vfas amino acids sugars lcfas proteins carbohydrates lipids and various degraders 2 7 1 model calibration the stoichiometric coefficients f si xc f xi xc f ch xc f li xc and f pr xc were modified according to the results of the sequential extraction and instrumental analysis at the same time the initial

rrna gene sequence analysis other stoichiometric and kinetic parameters and the inhibition function of the model were established using default values batstone et al 2002a 2 7 2 model evaluation the goodness of fit between the experimental and simulated values for a variable was quantified by calculating theil s inequality coefficient tic as shown in eq 1a zhou 1993 when the tic is less than 0 3 this means that the simulation results are in good agreement with the measured values 1a ti c j k 1 n data j k i 1 n data j k y i j k y i j k 2 1 n data j k i 1 n data j k y i j k 2 1 n data j k i 1 n data j k y i j k 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 organic fractionation of the was 3 1 1 ftir spectra analysis the ftir analysis of the four types of sludge is shown in fig 1 a the primary absorption peaks and the corresponding functional groups are depicted in table s3 the absorption peaks at 1550 1700 1600 cm 1 were attributed to the characteristic peaks of amide i and amide ii of proteins and the band at approximately 1300 cm 1 represented carboxyl and hydrocarbon like compounds such as lipids in addition the wavelength at 1200 900 cm 1 corresponded to carbohydrates and nucleic acids substances comte et al 2006 pei et al 2010 zhang et al 2020 collectively the positions of the absorption peaks of the four types of sludge were generally consistent indicating that the major organic components of the was were similar and were primarily proteins carbohydrates and lipids 3 1 2 xps analysis the atomic compositions of the four types of sludge were determined by xps over an energy range of 0 1300 ev see fig 1 b the elemental distribution of the four types of sludge was consistent with the primary elements of c o and n and small amounts of si al and na as shown in table s4 the mass fractions of c 57 0 69 0 o 20 0 28 0 and n 6 0 10 0 in the four sludge samples were generally homologous the c 1s peak of the four sludge samples was resolved to four peaks fig 2 table s5 shows the functional groups and their corresponding substances represented by the four peaks ahimou et al 2007 badireddy et al 2010 gomez suarez et al 2002 yin et al 2015 and the molar ratio of each functional group to the total carbon was also calculated table s4 the empirical formulas for the three primary components carbohydrates proteins and lipids in the adm1 were c6h10o5 n c16h24o5n4 and c50h90o6 respectively the empirical formulas for carbohydrates are consistent with other studies boonaert and rouxhet 2000 dufrêne and rouxhet 2011 in addition the empirical formulas for proteins and lipids were set according to alves et al 2009 which can be used to describe the characteristics of the sludge in the model the chemical compositions of these model components are listed in table s6 concentrations of total proteins cpr carbohydrates cch hydrocarbon like compounds corresponding to lipids chc li and lipids cli with respect to the total carbon were estimated using the following equations that were redesigned based on the results in tables s4 and s6 1 c p r 4 n c 2 c c h c 286 2 n c c 288 8 3 c h c l i c 284 6 0 4375 c p r 4 c l i 1 44 c h c l i as shown in table s7 the organic components of the four types of sludge were similar being rich in proteins and accounting for 36 0 46 0 followed by carbohydrates accounting for 2 0 10 0 and lipids accounting for approximately 1 0 in summary the xps analysis was utilized to achieve a preliminarily rapid quantification of the contents of the proteins carbohydrates and lipids in sludge samples 3 1 3 nmr analysis the t2 time distribution curves of the four types of sludge using lf 1h nmr are shown in fig 3 a there were two peaks for each sludge sample with one peak in the range of 0 2 ms representing the bound water integrated closely with polar groups on the surface of the tissue protein molecules and the other smaller peak at 10 300 ms representing lipids zhang et al 2018 the area under each peak of the t2 distribution spectrum was determined using cumulative integration for the relative quantification of protons at different states in this way the proportion of each peak area to the total peak area indicated the percentage of the corresponding substance in the 13c nmr spectrum the chemical shifts of 15 50 ppm 20 60 ppm 50 80 ppm 40 60 ppm 165 185 ppm 165 175 ppm and 182 215 ppm were for rch2 r3 ch c o c n rcooh r rconh2 and r2 c o respectively according to the molecular structure of proteins and carbohydrates the carbon of the amide functional group rconh2 and the carbon of the carbon oxygen single bond c o to the hydroxyl functional group were selected as specific markers to distinguish proteins and carbohydrates the number of carbon atoms of the corresponding functional group was estimated from the amplitude according to the molecular structure and the distribution of functional groups a protein c16h24o5n4 molecule responds with one rconh2 group while a carbohydrate c6h10o5 n molecule responds with five c o groups therefore the ratio of the amplitude of rconh2 to the 1 5 amplitude of c o of the sludge sample can be used to describe the ratio of the protein to the carbohydrate contents this method only roughly estimates the ratio of proteins to carbohydrates due to the different gains in the overhauser nuclear effect noe of the carbon spectrum peaks for the proton decoupling of different carbons the 13c nmr distribution curves of the pure proteins carbohydrates and the 4 types of sludge are shown in fig 3 b the ratio of the amplitude of rconh2 to the 1 5 amplitude of c o of the 4 types of sludge were 5 171 5 760 6 483 and 5 924 respectively indicating the same content ratios of proteins to carbohydrates in the four sludge samples in summary a rapid qualitative and quantitative analysis of the primary organic matter in sludge was achieved using three instrumental analytical methods the ftir analysis qualified the primary organic matters in the sludge samples xps and nmr were utilized to quantify the contents of these major organic matters and the contents were mutually validated to improve the accuracy of the instrumental analysis notably the xps provided an innovative way to determine the proportions of proteins carbohydrates and lipids in the sludge simultaneously especially the lipid content to avoid subjective uncertainties in the lipid contents obtained by xps lf 1h nmr was further utilized to validate and correct the lipid content moreover the protein content obtained by xps may have been overestimated due to the assumption that all of the nitrogen elements were derived from the amide functional group in the protein thus 13c nmr was also used to correct the protein content the lipid contents of the four sludge samples measured by xps were 1 0 1 0 1 2 and 1 1 which were in general agreement with the lipid contents measured by lf 1h nmr 0 7 1 0 3 5 and 1 5 therefore the average values of the above two measurements 0 9 1 0 2 4 and 1 3 were used as the final values of the lipid contents similarly the mean values obtained by the xps and 13c nmr analyses were taken as the final contents of the proteins in the sludge which were 38 0 44 0 25 0 and 51 0 in the four types of sludge 3 1 4 analysis by sequential extraction the proportions of the te cod and ne cod of the sludge samples measured by the sequential extraction are shown in fig 4 with the te cod accounting for 40 50 and the ne cod accounting for 50 60 fig 4 also reveals the proportions of the primary organic compounds in the extractable components the protein content accounted for 70 80 of the total extracted components and the carbohydrate accounted for approximately 8 the contents of organic compounds were obtained by multiplying the proportion of the te cod by the proportion of the corresponding compound in the total extractable fraction of the sludge using this method the protein contents of the wwtp s1 wwtp s2 wwtp s3 and lab s4 sludge were 34 0 35 0 33 0 and 39 0 respectively and the carbohydrate contents were 4 0 5 0 3 0 and 4 0 respectively fig 5 shows the box plots for contents of proteins carbohydrates and lipids obtained using the xps nmr the integrated instrumental analysis xps nmr and the sequential extraction method the median and mean values roughly overlapped while the data obtained by the integrated instrumental analysis mostly fell on the median and mean values these results reflected that the integrated xps and nmr analyses were more reliable the percentages of proteins carbohydrates and lipids measured by the integrated instrumental analysis and the sequential extraction method were basically consistent as shown in table s8 the results of the sequential extraction validated the accuracy and feasibility of xps nmr for the rapid detection of the major organic fractions in sludge because a sequential extraction cannot completely extract organic matter organic matter with low contents might not be detected or have high errors in addition sequential extraction consumes both chemical reagents and time therefore the integrated xps nmr provides a quick and environmentally friendly way to determine the contents of protein carbohydrate and lipid fractions in sludge 3 1 5 fluorescent components of the eps extracted from the sludge identified using parafac the 3d eem fluorescence spectra of the eps samples extracted from the four types of sludge are illustrated in fig s1 the distribution of the fluorescence response of the s eps lb eps and tb eps extracted from the four types of sludge were basically identical indicating that the organic substances contained in the eps of sludge were generally identical the parafac analysis was used to elucidate the fluorescence eem spectra of the sludge eps zhang et al 2016 all the fluorescence eems collected were successfully decomposed using parafac into a 3 component model fig s2 fig s3 shows both the eem contours of the three components and the excitation and emission loadings for each component component 1 c1 was characterized by a fluorescence peak with an excitation emission wavelength at 318 391 nm that is similar to carbohydrate like substances that primarily contain melanoidin like and microbial humic acid like substances component 2 c2 showed a fluorescence peak at the 356 461 nm excitation emission wavelength that is similar to humic like substances component 3 c3 was composed of two peaks with a wavelength pair of 228 and 288 359 nm similar to the component associated with protein like substances that primarily contain tryptophan like substances this result indicated that samples contained protein like and humic like fluorophores by comparison with components previously identified chen et al 2003 jimenez et al 2014 because protein would be hydrolyzed to amino acids with peaks responding to the component1 c1 region of the eem in a strong alkaline environment both c1 and c3 should be considered to be the protein fractions of the tb eps extracted using the 0 1 mol l naoh the fmax of each component in each eem sample was derived from the 3 component parafac model and this value can reflect the relative concentration of the component in the corresponding sample fig 6 shows the fmax intensities and relative percentages of the eps components s eps lb eps and tb eps extracted from the sludge samples the positions of the fluorescence maxima and the corresponding substances with their relative percentages for the main peaks of each component are shown in table s9 the protein content of the extracted eps was 60 80 in all cases which was consistent with the extracted fractions measured directly using the chemical extraction methods c3 was 5 8 times higher than c1 meaning that the protein content was approximately 5 8 times higher than the carbohydrate content which is consistent with the instrumental analytical results in section 3 2 1 it has been reported that eps accounts for greater than 50 of the total organic fraction of sludge and the fraction of eps was similar to the organic fraction of sludge wilén et al 2003 these results further verify the effectiveness of the instrumental analysis for the rapid quantification of organic substances in sludge 3 2 identification and quantification of the initial degraders in the was the relative abundance of bacterial and archaeal communities in the raw wwtp s1 and wwtp s2 sludge samples found using the 16s rrna gene sequence analysis are shown in fig s4 the bacteria of the two types of raw was were primarily composed of proteobacteria 22 25 bacteroidota 18 25 chloroflexi approximately 10 actinobacteriota approximately 15 and a small number of firmicutes 3 at the phylum level at the family level they were primarily dominated by saprospiraceae rhodanobacteraceae which are macromolecule degrading bacteria liu et al 2021b norank o saccharimonadales and akyh767 which are hydrolytic or acidogenic bacteria chen et al 2019 liu et al 2021a the archaeal communities were primarily composed of methanobrevibacter methanobacterium and methanosaeta which are various methanogens braz et al 2019 the relative abundance of each type of microorganism in the raw was was classified according to the corresponding functional groups in the adm1 table 2 the proportion of the corresponding functional groups in the adm1 was recalculated according to their relative abundance and the initial concentration of each degrader was re set 3 3 anaerobic digestion performance of the was in the batch experiment for model calibration and validation the methane production of the wwtp s1 wwtp s2 wwtp s3 and lab s4 sludge during 47 days of ad were 170 0 272 7 268 7 and 244 5 ml g vss respectively fig 7 these figures were used to validate the model fig s5 shows the changes in the soluble chemical oxygen demand scod vfas and ph during the ad of the four types of sludge the change trends in the scod and vfas were consistent and the peak appeared near day 7 meaning that hydrolysis and acidogenesis were the primary biochemical processes of the ad of the sludge before day 7 and methanogenesis was dominant after day 7 except for the lab s4 sludge the concentrations of the scod and vfas after 20 days stabilized at certain values and remained unchanged until the end of the ad this was because the vss tss of lab s4 was much higher than that of the other three sludge samples table 1 by comparing the curves of each organic concentration proteins carbohydrates lipids amino acids sugars lcfas and vfas in the experiment with the preliminary simulation results by the adm1 the kinetic parameters related to the hydrolysis khyd acidogenesis km and methanogenesis km in the adm1 were calibrated in addition a 16s rrna gene sequence analysis was used to track the change in the microbial communities in the sludge samples during their ad processes to achieve better fitting the relative abundances of bacterial and archaeal communities of the wwtp s1 and wwtp s2 at days 0 39 and 47 during ad were measured and the results are shown in fig 8 the bacterial community changed significantly at the end of anaerobic digestion days 39 and 47 with an increase in microbial diversity that was primarily composed of anaerobic bacteria anaerolineaceae which degrade alkanes to produce formate acetate hydrogen and co2 liang et al 2015 acetate producing bacteria peptostreptococcaceae grigoryan et al 2021 and organic matter degrading bacteria solirubrobacteraceae and xanthobacteraceae chen et al 2021 whitman and suzuki 2015 notably the archaea before ad day 0 of both sludge samples were primarily composed of hydrogenotrophic methanogens methanobrevibacter and methanobacterium with a few acetoclastic methanogens braz et al 2019 while as ad proceeded the relative abundance of the acetoclastic methanogen methanosaeta gradually increased and the hydrogenotrophic methanogen methanobrevibacter gradually decreased at the end of ad days 39 and 47 the archaeal community changed significantly and was primarily dominated by methanobacterium and methanosaeta which indicates that the methanogenic pathways in the ad of both sludge were dominated by the acetoclastic methanogen the proportion of methanogenic pathways f ac aa and f h2 aa in the adm1 was re set according to this phenomenon 3 4 simulation of methane production first the sludge composition in the adm1 was modified based on the results of the instrumental analysis and sequential extraction the microbial diversity based on 16s rrna gene sequence analysis was then used to confirm the initial concentration of degraders in the adm1 in addition the distribution of the corresponding bacterial and archaeal functional communities at the end of ad day 47 was used to modify the acidogenic and methanogenic pathways the kinetic parameters of the adm1 were calibrated using batch experiments making the adm1 more applicable for the simulation of the ad of sludge taking the wwtp s2 sludge as an example the setting and modification of the relevant parameters in the default adm1 the adm1 with modified fractions of the organic components of was adm1 mfo and the adm1 with full parameter modification for was adm1 fpm are shown in table 3 3 4 1 modification of the stoichiometric parameters based on instrumental analysis the disintegration products of xc were re divided according to the results of the sequential extraction and instrumental analysis with the coefficient f product substrate in the adm1 modified the value of f xi xc was established according to the proportion of ash content 1 vss tss and the value of f si xc was generally established as 0 00 0 02 huete et al 2006 the sludge wwtp s2 was used as an example and the stoichiometric parameters of the disintegration products of xc were modified as f si xc 0 02 f xi xc 0 45 f ch xc 0 07 f li xc 0 01 and f pr xc 0 45 in addition the proportion of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis and acetoclastic methanogenesis pathways f h2 aa f ac aa was adjusted based on the results of the 16s rrna gene sequence analysis as shown in table 3 3 4 2 calibration of the kinetic parameters based on the batch experiment the results of the batch experiments were utilized to calibrate the kinetic parameters the hydrolysis parameters were modified according to changes in the concentration of proteins carbohydrates lipids and their corresponding hydrolysates and were further re modified according to the ratio of the relative abundances of their degraders obtained by the 16s rrna gene sequence analysis finally the value of khyd ch khyd pr and khyd li were modified to 1 5 1 125 and 0 25 respectively km ac and km aa were modified according to the changes in the amino acids and acetate concentrations and methane contents that were determined to be 36 and 26 respectively 3 4 3 inputs for the initial components the measured concentration of the tcod of the sludge was input into the adm1 model as xc and the measured concentration of dissolved substances in the sludge was directly input into the model as ss for the subsequent acidogenesis and methanogenesis processes the initial concentration scale of each degrader was preliminarily determined using the parameter estimation in west and then the initial concentration was established according to the relative proportion of the microbial abundance using the 16s rrna gene sequence analysis 3 4 4 validation of the methodology adm1 variables input and simulation the v liq and v gas of the ad reactor in the model were set at 0 0005 m3 and 0 0001 m3 respectively according to the experimental setup the cumulative methane production of the wwtp s2 sludge simulated by the default adm1 the adm1 mfo and the adm1 fpm were compared with the results of the laboratory measurements fig 9 the adm1 mfo simulation curve was a visibly better fit than the default adm1 and the adm1 fpm simulation curve was the best fit to the experimental curve indicating that the adm1 fpm effectively simulated the methane production of the sludge in addition the changes in simulation of vfas and methane production during anaerobic digestion of the four sludge samples using the adm1 fpm model are shown in fig s6 compared with figs 7 and s5 the simulated cumulative methane productions of the four types of sludge are consistent with the experimental trends these indicate that the adm1 fpm model can simulate the methanogenesis process of anaerobic digestion of sludge very well the variation trends of simulated and measured vfas are basically consistent but the simulated values are higher than the experimental values in the model the biodegradable fraction of xc was completely hydrolyzed and acidified to vfas whereas in the actual anaerobic digester some slowly biodegradable fraction might not be completely degraded and converted to vfas within 50 days of the anaerobic digestion this may lead to deviations between the measured vfas and the simulated values the specific reasons need to be further explored and the model needs to be correspondingly improved in our further work 3 4 5 model evaluation the simulation results of the adm1 fpm fit the measured values well with tic 0 049 and this was an 89 8 reduction compared to the original default adm1 model tic 0 480 and an 85 2 reduction compared to the adm1 mfo tic 0 330 the smaller tic value meant better goodness of fit thus the adm1 fpm is a good prediction tool for the ad of was of course there are still some shortcomings in the present adm1 fpm model which need to be improved for instance the value of f xi xc was assumed to approximate the proportion of ash content 1 vss tss in fact the ash fraction is not exactly equivalent to the xi currently in most published studies the inert fraction xi is obtained by subtracting the biochemical methane potential bmp from the total cod fisgativa et al 2020 this method is more accurate but also complex and time consuming in this study considering that proteins carbohydrates and lipids are the main organic substances in was and xi is not involved in the subsequent anaerobic digestion conversion processes hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis in the adm1 model to simplify the determination procedure of xi xi fraction was assumed to approximate the ash fraction 1 vss tss the simulation results indicated that this had little influence on the modeling of methane production in the future work better xi fractionation methods need to be explored to improve the model accuracy 4 conclusions in this work a method for the quick fractionation of the organic components proteins carbohydrates and lipids of the was was developed and the initial content of microbial degraders was established these contributed to improvements in the simulation of the ad process using adm1 the combination of ftir xps and nmr analyses achieved rapid and accurate qualitative and quantitative determinations of the organic fractions of the sludge with 25 0 50 0 proteins 2 0 10 0 carbohydrates and 0 9 2 3 lipids for the four types of sludge the results of the sequential chemical extraction and 3d fluorescence analysis verified the reliability of the above instrumental analysis the measurements were then used to modify the stoichiometric coefficient f product xc of the adm1 for the fractionation of organic components the concentrations of the initial degrader fractions of the adm1 were determined using a 16s rrna gene sequence analysis the highest abundance of macromolecular degrading bacteria proteobacteria bacteroidota firmicutes saprospiraceae and rhodanobacteraceae 60 was found and various types of hydrolytic or acidogenic bacteria 40 as well as a small number of methanogens less than 1 batch experiments were used to calibrate the kinetic parameters of the adm1 based on the above modifications the adm1 fpm was able to simulate the methanogenic potential during the ad of the sludge well tic 0 049 with an improvement of 89 8 in the goodness of fit compared to the default adm1 model this study provided a novel and effective

14832,the anaerobic digestion model no 1 adm1 with fixed fractions of the substrate components is currently used to simulate methane production during the anaerobic digestion ad of waste activated sludge was however the goodness of fit for the simulation is not ideal due to the different characteristics of was from different regions in this study a novel methodology based on a modern instrumental analysis and 16s rrna gene sequence analysis for the fractionation of organic components and microbial degraders in the was is investigated to modify the fractions of the components in the adm1 the combination of fourier transform infrared ftir x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps and nuclear magnetic resonance nmr analyses were used to achieve a rapid and accurate fractionation of the primary organic matters in the was that was verified using both the sequential extraction method and the excitation emission matrix eem the protein carbohydrate and lipid contents in the four different sludge samples measured using the above combined instrumental analyses were 25 0 50 0 2 0 10 0 and 0 9 2 3 the microbial diversity based on 16s rrna gene sequence analysis was utilized to re set the initial fractions of the microbial degraders in the adm1 a batch experiment was utilized to further calibrate the kinetic parameters in the adm1 based on the above optimization of the stoichiometric and kinetic parameters the adm1 with full parameter modification for was adm1 fpm simulated the methane production of the was very well with a theil s inequality coefficient tic of 0 049 which was increased by 89 8 than that of the default adm1 fit the proposed approach with its rapid and reliable performance demonstrated a strong application potential for the fractionation of

request 1 introduction with accelerated urbanization and industrialization the number of waste water treatment plants wwtps worldwide is increasing annually as a byproduct of sewage treatment waste activated sludge was has the dual properties of being both a pollutant and a resource and its disposal has become an emerging issue anaerobic digestion ad is an effective technology to realize the reduction and reduce harm from organic solid waste as well as for resource recovery however the relatively low bioconversion efficiency and high operational costs of ad limit its large scale industrial application xu et al 2020 zhang and li 2019 the use of a mathematical model to simulate the methane production in the ad system could help to optimize the operation and improve digestion efficiency adm1 is a commonly used model that describes ad batstone et al 2002b and has been typically modified to simulate methane production on various types of organic substrates jimenez et al 2020 mottet et al 2013 song et al 2018 the organic composition of substrates can affect the ad process the properties of sludge vary widely from country to country and region to region fisgativa et al 2018 investigated the fractions and corresponding methanogenic potential of sludge in different wwtps in france and found that inorganic fractions accounted for approximately 20 and organic fractions primarily consisted of proteins major components in secondary sludge carbohydrates major components in primary sludge and a small number of lipids wilén et al 2003 studied the components of sludge in australia and found that protein accounted for over 43 followed by humus 15 42 carbohydrates 10 18 and inorganic matter 20 however the inorganic fraction of was is much higher up to approximately 50 in china duan et al 2016 zhang and li 2019 gonzalez et al 2018 found that the percentages of the different components also varied remarkably in different sludge sources in general proteins accounted for 40 60 humic substances accounted for 10 30 carbohydrates accounted for 10 20 and the other constituents were less than 10 of the sludge substrate carbohydrates proteins and lipids as major components of sludge have different methanogenic potentials xue et al 2020 and their contents vary in different was in the original adm1 the recommended fractions of sludge components are 0 3 0 3 0 3 and 0 1 for the particulate proteins x pr carbohydrates x ch lipids x li and particulate inert material xi batstone et al 2002a which ignored the variability among different sludge substrates this may result in an inaccurate simulation of methane production during ad processes therefore it is crucial to determine the contents of the major organic matters in was involved in the adm1 x pr x ch and x li and rescale their proportions to accurately predict the resource or energy recovery potential of was currently several available methods are utilized to determine the primary organic matter in the substrate of adm1 i the methane production rate mpr curve measured by anaerobic respiration is used to divide the fraction of the particulate substrate girault et al 2012 ii the protein content is estimated using the organic nitrogen content multiplied by the conversion factor 6 25 and the lipid content is determined using soxhlet extraction finally the chemical oxygen demand cod proportion of carbohydrates is determined to be carbohydrates 100 100 proteins 100 lipids 100 fisgativa et al 2020 iii the contents of the organic components in sludge are measured using coupling sequential extraction and spectrophotometric or 3d fluorescence spectroscopy muller et al 2014 iv low field 1h nuclear magnetic resonance lf 1h nmr is primarily used in the field of food science for the detection of lipids moistures and moisture form bertram et al 2004 zhang et al 2018 v the weender analysis method uses nitrogen content multiplied by 6 25 to obtain protein content alkaline extraction to obtain carbohydrate crude fiber content and ether leaching to obtain crude lipid content to characterize different substrates for biogas production peters et al 2018 collectively the existing methods are complex due to their extraction and crushing processes are error prone time consuming and require large amounts of chemicals therefore a quick quantification method is required to identify the major organic components in sludge and to realize the accurate fractionation of sludge substrate in adm1 various instrumental analyses have been developed in recent years which have been gradually applied to characterize and semi quantify complex substances for example fourier transform infrared ftir and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps have been widely used to study the properties and composition of organic matters in extracellular polymeric substances eps and other substances badireddy et al 2010 2008 zhang et al 2019 in recent years lf 1h nmr was first used for the detection of the moisture status and lipid content in sludge dong et al 2021 wu et al 2019 reports have shown that the lipid peak may well be separated using the spin spin relaxation t2 time hickey et al 2006 as a type of solid waste sludge components are complex and difficult to distinguish therefore instrumental methods have not been comprehensively used to quantify the organic fractions of sludge the instrumental analytical methods mentioned above are universal and accessible and can provide potential prospective applications for the rapid qualitative and quantitative determination of the primary organic matter in solid waste adm1 includes seven types of microbial degraders that are responsible for the degradation of amino acids sugars long chain fatty acids lcfas butyrate and valerate propionate acetate and hydrogen the microbial diversity among degraders of the same functional group has been described in the literature by extending the adm1 from seven biomass species seven functional groups one species per functional group to 70 different biomass species seven functional groups 10 species per functional group ramirez et al 2009 jablonski and lukaszewicz 2014 combined the adm1 with anaerobic activity tests to estimate the structure of microbial communities in methanogenic digesters in the above studies the initial concentrations of the seven degraders were all the same in the original default state of the adm1 and this deviated from the actual situation of the ad however a quantitative method for the initial microbial fractions of the model remains lacking with the development of molecular biology the relative abundance of the primary microorganisms in sludge can be determined using a 16s rrna gene sequence analysis that provides a potential method for the identification of different microbial proportions the overall goal of this study is to develop a practical methodology to determine the major initial components of the adm1 to improve the fit of the adm1 for the better simulation of the methane production process the existing instrumental methods ftir xps and nmr are integrated to achieve the rapid determination of the major organic fractions proteins carbohydrates and lipids of sludge and a 16s rrna gene sequence analysis is utilized to determine the initial fractions of the model microorganisms the kinetic parameters in the adm1 were calibrated based on batch experiments this study provides a novel method for the quick determination of the initial organic and microbial components of adm1 using a modern instrumental analysis 2 material and methods 2 1 was properties four types of was samples were collected from the secondary sedimentation tanks of different wwtps in which three samples were obtained from wwtps with anaerobic anoxic oxic aao treatment processes and one sample was collected from a lab scale aao reactor these samples were named wwtp s1 wwtp s2 wwtp s3 lab s4 the description of the wwtps is provided in table s1 after being collected from the wwtps the sludge samples were transported to the laboratory immediately they were then screened to remove coarse particles and the sludge properties were determined as soon as possible the average characteristics of these four was samples are shown in table 1 the ph was approximately 6 5 and the volatile suspended solids vss total suspended solids tss ratio of the sludge from the three wwtps was in the range of 55 0 65 0 meaning that the ash content was 35 0 45 0 the initial concentration of ammonia nitrogen was approximately 10 0 mg l lab s4 had the highest organic content distinguishing it from the other three types of sludge from the full scale wwtps this was because lab s4 was derived from the aao reactor fed with synthetic domestic wastewater in the laboratory one liter of pre treated sludge was centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 10 min to discard the supernatant the sludge pellet obtained from the centrifugation was freeze dried and ground into powder for sludge fractionation the remaining sludge was temporarily stored in a refrigerator at 4 c for the ad experiments 2 2 fractionation of the organic substrates in the was 2 2 1 instrumental analysis using ftir xps and nmr an ftir analysis was used to identify the main organic matters in the sludge and xps and nmr were used to quantify the contents of these major organic matters an ftir spectrophotometer was applied to explore the functional groups of the was the spectra were recorded using an ftir spectrometer nicolet 5700 thermo electron corporation usa in the range of 4000 400 cm 1 with a resolution of 4 cm 1 xps thermo scientific k alpha usa was utilized to estimate the elemental composition of the sludge and to assess the functionalities associated with the elements of carbon oxygen and nitrogen using the advantage software the dry sludge samples were subjected to a t2 measurement using lf nmr mesomr23 060h i nmr system niumag electric corporation china that was equipped with a 0 5 t permanent magnet corresponding to a proton resonance frequency of 23 2 mhz at 32 c the c spectrum distribution curve of the sludge was drawn using the 13c nmr analysis and the peak positions of the carbon atoms of the corresponding functional groups were determined by comparing the pure protein casein and carbohydrates dextrose substances at the same time the c spectra measurements of the was casein and dextran were performed using nmr bruker 400 mhz germany with a cycle delay of 2 s a mass rotation rate of 5 khz and a contact pulse of 2 ms the instrumental analytical methods are detailed in the supplementary material supporting methods s1 s4 2 2 2 sequential extraction procedure and analysis of extracts a sequential extraction approach was utilized to correlate the bioavailability of the organic matter in the sludge with chemical extractability the sequential extraction was a modification of the method reported by jimenez et al 2014 instead of strong acid extraction ultrasound was used to extract a portion of the intracellular protein and carbohydrate in this modified method to obtain the sludge extracts without destroying the original organic structure of the sludge as much as possible the major extracts were as follows dissolved organic matter dom obtained by centrifugation 8000 rpm 10 min 4 c and filtration at 0 45 µm soluble eps s eps obtained by washing the remaining particles with a neutral saline solution loosely bound eps lb eps obtained by saline alkali 0 01 mol l nacl 0 01 mol l naoh extraction tightly bound eps tb eps obtained by a strong alkaline 0 1 mol l naoh extraction and the extraction of cellular material obtained using a strong alkaline 0 1 mol l naoh extraction in a sonication environment the cod of the extracts and the cod of the remaining non extractable fraction ne cod were also determined the cod of the total extractable fraction te cod was obtained by summing the cod of the above five extracts 2 2 3 3d excitation emission matrix fluorescence spectroscopy parallel factor analysis the 3d excitation emission matrix 3d eem fluorescence spectra were measured using a cary eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer agilent technologies usa to analyze the fluorescence components the excitation wavelengths varied from 200 to 550 nm with increments of 10 nm while the emission wavelengths varied from 200 to 550 nm the slit widths of the emission and excitation monochromators were fixed at 5 nm the scanning monochromator speed was approximately 1200 nm min 1 the fluorescence values were recorded every 0 5 nm between 200 and 600 nm the approach of the parallel factor parafac modeling of eems can provide both quantitative and qualitative models of the eem data and statistically decompose the complex fluorescence signal stedmon and bro 2008 despite the complex nature of the samples the extracted fluorophores represent a group of organic compounds with similar fluorescence properties the maximum fluorescence intensity fmax of each component has been widely used to estimate the relative concentration of each component murphy et al 2011 stedmon and bro 2008 therefore the fmax of each parafac component was used to demonstrate the quantitative and qualitative differences among samples to obtain a better understanding of the organic extraction of sludge zhang et al 2016 a series of parafac models with three to seven components were generated a residual analysis spectral properties examination split half analysis and random initialization were utilized for the model validation stedmon and bro 2008 2 3 microbial diversity based on the 16s rrna gene sequence analysis for the initial microbial fractionation of sludge the sludge samples were stored at 80 c and analyzed for the microbial diversity of bacteria and archaea using a 16s rrna gene sequence analysis the relative abundance of the major bacteria was analyzed at the phylum and family levels and the archaea were analyzed at the genus levels the total microbial genomic dna was extracted from sludge samples using the e z n a soil dna kit omega bio tek norcross ga u s according to the manufacturer s instructions the primer sets of bacteria were 338f 5 actcctacgggaggcagca 3 and 806r 5 ggactachvgggtwtctaat 3 to amplify the v3 v4 variable regions of the 16s rrna gene ping et al 2022 the primer set for archaea was 524f10extf tgycagccgccgcggtaa and arch958rmodr yccggcgttgavtccaatt to amplify the v4 v5 variable region of the gene the purified amplicons were pooled in equimolar amounts and paired end sequenced on an illumina miseq pe300 platform illumina san diego usa according to the standard protocols by majorbio bio pharm technology co ltd shanghai china the raw sequencing reads were deposited into the national center for biotechnology information ncbi sequence read archive sra database the method of 16s rrna gene sequence analysis is detailed in the supplementary material supporting method s5 2 4 batch anaerobic digestion experiment the ad experiment was conducted in 600 ml serum bottles that were placed in a shaker 35 1 c 275 rpm with three parallel samples each bottle contained 500 ml of raw sludge that had been retrieved and stored at 4 c for less than 24 h with a headspace volume of 100 ml nitrogen blowing was conducted for 5 min prior to the experiment to ensure anaerobic condition the ad experiments were run for 47 d until the performance of the digestion reached a steady state sampling was undertaken every two days to determine the cod volatile fatty acids vfas nh4 protein and carbohydrate methane production and ph changes during the ad process were monitored simultaneously after ad some of the sludge samples were stored frozen in a refrigerator at 80 c for the subsequent microbial diversity analysis 2 5 analysis of the sludge characteristics and the ad products a portable 6010 m ph meter jenco usa was used to measure the ph of the sludge the soluble carbohydrates and proteins were analyzed following the anthrone method trevelyan et al 1952 and the lowry folin method lowry et al 1951 respectively the tss vss total chemical oxygen demand tcod and total ammonia nitrogen were measured according to standard methods apha 2005 the concentrations of the vfas were detected using an agilent 6890 gas chromatograph gc agilent technologies usa equipped with a flame ionization detector the methane ch4 content of the biogas was measured using gas chromatography gc 2010 plus shimadzu japan equipped with a thermal conductivity detector tcd 2 6 the adm1 with full parameter modification for waste activated sludge 2 6 1 fractionation of the influent components the influent sludge total complex particulate waste xc components in the adm1 primarily consisted of organic compounds x ch x pr and x li as well as inorganic components xi and soluble inert material si the xc and other organic substrates were input into the model in the unit of kg cod m3 the xc was disintegrated into the five components mentioned above according to their corresponding proportions the yield of the product to the substrate f product substrate then the subsequent hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis occurred the initial state variables of the soluble fractions ss in the adm1 were directly set according to the concentration measured in the laboratory the vfas were converted to cod using the stoichiometric conversion coefficients 1 07 acetate 1 51 propionate 1 82 n butyrate and isobutyrate and 2 04 n valerate and iso valerate as previously reported by li et al 2014 at the same time the initial concentrations of the various degraders x aa x su x fa x c4 x pro x ac x h2 were input into the model 2 6 2 kinetic equations the adm1 for the was included two extracellular steps disintegration and hydrolysis and three intracellular steps acidogenesis or fermentation acetogenesis and methanogenesis the kinetic equations employed for all of the biochemical processes in adm1 are summarized in table s2 all extracellular steps were assumed to be first order kinetics and this was a simplification based on empiricism the xc was first disintegrated into x ch x pr and x li as well as xi and si this disintegration process was described by a disintegration coefficient kdis then the x ch x pr and x li substrates were further hydrolyzed to amino acids sugars and lcfas respectively and the corresponding hydrolytic coefficients were khyd pr khyd ch and khyd li respectively monod type kinetics for the substrate uptake are used as the basis for all intracellular biochemical reactions batstone et al 2002b biomass growth is implicit in substrate uptake the decay of biomass was represented by first order kinetics and the dead biomass was maintained in the system and became part of the composite particulate material 2 7 modeling approach of the methane production the modeling and simulation were conducted using the west software mikebydhi com a separate anaerobic digester was established in the adm1 and its digestate volume v liq and gas volume v gas were established according to the actual laboratory ad volume and headspace volume the mode of the model was set at 1 mode 1 to simulate the ad process under unregulated ph conditions most of the initial concentrations of the substrates and initial ph were directly obtained from the experimental measurements and input into the anaerobic digester of the model the relevant metrics that needed to be simulated for output were set and these included the gas production the partial pressure of methane ph concentrations of the vfas amino acids sugars lcfas proteins carbohydrates lipids and various degraders 2 7 1 model calibration the stoichiometric coefficients f si xc f xi xc f ch xc f li xc and f pr xc were modified according to the results of the sequential extraction and instrumental analysis at the same time the initial concentration of each degrader based on the 16s rrna gene sequence analysis was also established in the adm1 model some other key kinetic parameters kdis khyd pr khyd ch khyd li specific monod maximum uptake rates of amino acids km aa acetate km ac butyrate and valerate km c4 yield of organisms to amino acids yaa sugar ysu hydrogen yh2 and the stoichiometric parameters the yield of the product to the amino acids f ac aa f h2 aa f pro aa and f bu aa were modified according to the batch ad experiments the khyd pr khyd ch khyd li and f ac aa and f h2 aa were further modified according to the 16s rrna gene sequence analysis other stoichiometric and kinetic parameters and the inhibition function of the model were established using default values batstone et al 2002a 2 7 2 model evaluation the goodness of fit between the experimental and simulated values for a variable was quantified by calculating theil s inequality coefficient tic as shown in eq 1a zhou 1993 when the tic is less than 0 3 this means that the simulation results are in good agreement with the measured values 1a ti c j k 1 n data j k i 1 n data j k y i j k y i j k 2 1 n data j k i 1 n data j k y i j k 2 1 n data j k i 1 n data j k y i j k 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 organic fractionation of the was 3 1 1 ftir spectra analysis the ftir analysis of the four types of sludge is shown in fig 1 a the primary absorption peaks and the corresponding functional groups are depicted in table s3 the absorption peaks at 1550 1700 1600 cm 1 were attributed to the characteristic peaks of amide i and amide ii of proteins and the band at approximately 1300 cm 1 represented carboxyl and hydrocarbon like compounds such as lipids in addition the wavelength at 1200 900 cm 1 corresponded to carbohydrates and nucleic acids substances comte et al 2006 pei et al 2010 zhang et al 2020 collectively the positions of the absorption peaks of the four types of sludge were generally consistent indicating that the major organic components of the was were similar and were primarily proteins carbohydrates and lipids 3 1 2 xps analysis the atomic compositions of the four types of sludge were determined by xps over an energy range of 0 1300 ev see fig 1 b the elemental distribution of the four types of sludge was consistent with the primary elements of c o and n and small amounts of si al and na as shown in table s4 the mass fractions of c 57 0 69 0 o 20 0 28 0 and n 6 0 10 0 in the four sludge samples were generally homologous the c 1s peak of the four sludge samples was resolved to four peaks fig 2 table s5 shows the functional groups and their corresponding substances represented by the four peaks ahimou et al 2007 badireddy et al 2010 gomez suarez et al 2002 yin et al 2015 and the molar ratio of each functional group to the total carbon was also calculated table s4 the empirical formulas for the three primary components carbohydrates proteins and lipids in the adm1 were c6h10o5 n c16h24o5n4 and c50h90o6 respectively the empirical formulas for carbohydrates are consistent with other studies boonaert and rouxhet 2000 dufrêne and rouxhet 2011 in addition the empirical formulas for proteins and lipids were set according to alves et al 2009 which can be used to describe the characteristics of the sludge in the model the chemical compositions of these model components are listed in table s6 concentrations of total proteins cpr carbohydrates cch hydrocarbon like compounds corresponding to lipids chc li and lipids cli with respect to the total carbon were estimated using the following equations that were redesigned based on the results in tables s4 and s6 1 c p r 4 n c 2 c c h c 286 2 n c c 288 8 3 c h c l i c 284 6 0 4375 c p r 4 c l i 1 44 c h c l i as shown in table s7 the organic components of the four types of sludge were similar being rich in proteins and accounting for 36 0 46 0 followed by carbohydrates accounting for 2 0 10 0 and lipids accounting for approximately 1 0 in summary the xps analysis was utilized to achieve a preliminarily rapid quantification of the contents of the proteins carbohydrates and lipids in sludge samples 3 1 3 nmr analysis the t2 time distribution curves of the four types of sludge using lf 1h nmr are shown in fig 3 a there were two peaks for each sludge sample with one peak in the range of 0 2 ms representing the bound water integrated closely with polar groups on the surface of the tissue protein molecules and the other smaller peak at 10 300 ms representing lipids zhang et al 2018 the area under each peak of the t2 distribution spectrum was determined using cumulative integration for the relative quantification of protons at different states in this way the proportion of each peak area to the total peak area indicated the percentage of the corresponding substance in the 13c nmr spectrum the chemical shifts of 15 50 ppm 20 60 ppm 50 80 ppm 40 60 ppm 165 185 ppm 165 175 ppm and 182 215 ppm were for rch2 r3 ch c o c n rcooh r rconh2 and r2 c o respectively according to the molecular structure of proteins and carbohydrates the carbon of the amide functional group rconh2 and the carbon of the carbon oxygen single bond c o to the hydroxyl functional group were selected as specific markers to distinguish proteins and carbohydrates the number of carbon atoms of the corresponding functional group was estimated from the amplitude according to the molecular structure and the distribution of functional groups a protein c16h24o5n4 molecule responds with one rconh2 group while a carbohydrate c6h10o5 n molecule responds with five c o groups therefore the ratio of the amplitude of rconh2 to the 1 5 amplitude of c o of the sludge sample can be used to describe the ratio of the protein to the carbohydrate contents this method only roughly estimates the ratio of proteins to carbohydrates due to the different gains in the overhauser nuclear effect noe of the carbon spectrum peaks for the proton decoupling of different carbons the 13c nmr distribution curves of the pure proteins carbohydrates and the 4 types of sludge are shown in fig 3 b the ratio of the amplitude of rconh2 to the 1 5 amplitude of c o of the 4 types of sludge were 5 171 5 760 6 483 and 5 924 respectively indicating the same content ratios of proteins to carbohydrates in the four sludge samples in summary a rapid qualitative and quantitative analysis of the primary organic matter in sludge was achieved using three instrumental analytical methods the ftir analysis qualified the primary organic matters in the sludge samples xps and nmr were utilized to quantify the contents of these major organic matters and the contents were mutually validated to improve the accuracy of the instrumental analysis notably the xps provided an innovative way to determine the proportions of proteins carbohydrates and lipids in the sludge simultaneously especially the lipid content to avoid subjective uncertainties in the lipid contents obtained by xps lf 1h nmr was further utilized to validate and correct the lipid content moreover the protein content obtained by xps may have been overestimated due to the assumption that all of the nitrogen elements were derived from the amide functional group in the protein thus 13c nmr was also used to correct the protein content the lipid contents of the four sludge samples measured by xps were 1 0 1 0 1 2 and 1 1 which were in general agreement with the lipid contents measured by lf 1h nmr 0 7 1 0 3 5 and 1 5 therefore the average values of the above two measurements 0 9 1 0 2 4 and 1 3 were used as the final values of the lipid contents similarly the mean values obtained by the xps and 13c nmr analyses were taken as the final contents of the proteins in the sludge which were 38 0 44 0 25 0 and 51 0 in the four types of sludge 3 1 4 analysis by sequential extraction the proportions of the te cod and ne cod of the sludge samples measured by the sequential extraction are shown in fig 4 with the te cod accounting for 40 50 and the ne cod accounting for 50 60 fig 4 also reveals the proportions of the primary organic compounds in the extractable components the protein content accounted for 70 80 of the total extracted components and the carbohydrate accounted for approximately 8 the contents of organic compounds were obtained by multiplying the proportion of the te cod by the proportion of the corresponding compound in the total extractable fraction of the sludge using this method the protein contents of the wwtp s1 wwtp s2 wwtp s3 and lab s4 sludge were 34 0 35 0 33 0 and 39 0 respectively and the carbohydrate contents were 4 0 5 0 3 0 and 4 0 respectively fig 5 shows the box plots for contents of proteins carbohydrates and lipids obtained using the xps nmr the integrated instrumental analysis xps nmr and the sequential extraction method the median and mean values roughly overlapped while the data obtained by the integrated instrumental analysis mostly fell on the median and mean values these results reflected that the integrated xps and nmr analyses were more reliable the percentages of proteins carbohydrates and lipids measured by the integrated instrumental analysis and the sequential extraction method were basically consistent as shown in table s8 the results of the sequential extraction validated the accuracy and feasibility of xps nmr for the rapid detection of the major organic fractions in sludge because a sequential extraction cannot completely extract organic matter organic matter with low contents might not be detected or have high errors in addition sequential extraction consumes both chemical reagents and time therefore the integrated xps nmr provides a quick and environmentally friendly way to determine the contents of protein carbohydrate and lipid fractions in sludge 3 1 5 fluorescent components of the eps extracted from the sludge identified using parafac the 3d eem fluorescence spectra of the eps samples extracted from the four types of sludge are illustrated in fig s1 the distribution of the fluorescence response of the s eps lb eps and tb eps extracted from the four types of sludge were basically identical indicating that the organic substances contained in the eps of sludge were generally identical the parafac analysis was used to elucidate the fluorescence eem spectra of the sludge eps zhang et al 2016 all the fluorescence eems collected were successfully decomposed using parafac into a 3 component model fig s2 fig s3 shows both the eem contours of the three components and the excitation and emission loadings for each component component 1 c1 was characterized by a fluorescence peak with an excitation emission wavelength at 318 391 nm that is similar to carbohydrate like substances that primarily contain melanoidin like and microbial humic acid like substances component 2 c2 showed a fluorescence peak at the 356 461 nm excitation emission wavelength that is similar to humic like substances component 3 c3 was composed of two peaks with a wavelength pair of 228 and 288 359 nm similar to the component associated with protein like substances that primarily contain tryptophan like substances this result indicated that samples contained protein like and humic like fluorophores by comparison with components previously identified chen et al 2003 jimenez et al 2014 because protein would be hydrolyzed to amino acids with peaks responding to the component1 c1 region of the eem in a strong alkaline environment both c1 and c3 should be considered to be the protein fractions of the tb eps extracted using the 0 1 mol l naoh the fmax of each component in each eem sample was derived from the 3 component parafac model and this value can reflect the relative concentration of the component in the corresponding sample fig 6 shows the fmax intensities and relative percentages of the eps components s eps lb eps and tb eps extracted from the sludge samples the positions of the fluorescence maxima and the corresponding substances with their relative percentages for the main peaks of each component are shown in table s9 the protein content of the extracted eps was 60 80 in all cases which was consistent with the extracted fractions measured directly using the chemical extraction methods c3 was 5 8 times higher than c1 meaning that the protein content was approximately 5 8 times higher than the carbohydrate content which is consistent with the instrumental analytical results in section 3 2 1 it has been reported that eps accounts for greater than 50 of the total organic fraction of sludge and the fraction of eps was similar to the organic fraction of sludge wilén et al 2003 these results further verify the effectiveness of the instrumental analysis for the rapid quantification of organic substances in sludge 3 2 identification and quantification of the initial degraders in the was the relative abundance of bacterial and archaeal communities in the raw wwtp s1 and wwtp s2 sludge samples found using the 16s rrna gene sequence analysis are shown in fig s4 the bacteria of the two types of raw was were primarily composed of proteobacteria 22 25 bacteroidota 18 25 chloroflexi approximately 10 actinobacteriota approximately 15 and a small number of firmicutes 3 at the phylum level at the family level they were primarily dominated by saprospiraceae rhodanobacteraceae which are macromolecule degrading bacteria liu et al 2021b norank o saccharimonadales and akyh767 which are hydrolytic or acidogenic bacteria chen et al 2019 liu et al 2021a the archaeal communities were primarily composed of methanobrevibacter methanobacterium and methanosaeta which are various methanogens braz et al 2019 the relative abundance of each type of microorganism in the raw was was classified according to the corresponding functional groups in the adm1 table 2 the proportion of the corresponding functional groups in the adm1 was recalculated according to their relative abundance and the initial concentration of each degrader was re set 3 3 anaerobic digestion performance of the was in the batch experiment for model calibration and validation the methane production of the wwtp s1 wwtp s2 wwtp s3 and lab s4 sludge during 47 days of ad were 170 0 272 7 268 7 and 244 5 ml g vss respectively fig 7 these figures were used to validate the model fig s5 shows the changes in the soluble chemical oxygen demand scod vfas and ph during the ad of the four types of sludge the change trends in the scod and vfas were consistent and the peak appeared near day 7 meaning that hydrolysis and acidogenesis were the primary biochemical processes of the ad of the sludge before day 7 and methanogenesis was dominant after day 7 except for the lab s4 sludge the concentrations of the scod and vfas after 20 days stabilized at certain values and remained unchanged until the end of the ad this was because the vss tss of lab s4 was much higher than that of the other three sludge samples table 1 by comparing the curves of each organic concentration proteins carbohydrates lipids amino acids sugars lcfas and vfas in the experiment with the preliminary simulation results by the adm1 the kinetic parameters related to the hydrolysis khyd acidogenesis km and methanogenesis km in the adm1 were calibrated in addition a 16s rrna gene sequence analysis was used to track the change in the microbial communities in the sludge samples during their ad processes to achieve better fitting the relative abundances of bacterial and archaeal communities of the wwtp s1 and wwtp s2 at days 0 39 and 47 during ad were measured and the results are shown in fig 8 the bacterial community changed significantly at the end of anaerobic digestion days 39 and 47 with an increase in microbial diversity that was primarily composed of anaerobic bacteria anaerolineaceae which degrade alkanes to produce formate acetate hydrogen and co2 liang et al 2015 acetate producing bacteria peptostreptococcaceae grigoryan et al 2021 and organic matter degrading bacteria solirubrobacteraceae and xanthobacteraceae chen et al 2021 whitman and suzuki 2015 notably the archaea before ad day 0 of both sludge samples were primarily composed of hydrogenotrophic methanogens methanobrevibacter and methanobacterium with a few acetoclastic methanogens braz et al 2019 while as ad proceeded the relative abundance of the acetoclastic methanogen methanosaeta gradually increased and the hydrogenotrophic methanogen methanobrevibacter gradually decreased at the end of ad days 39 and 47 the archaeal community changed significantly and was primarily dominated by methanobacterium and methanosaeta which indicates that the methanogenic pathways in the ad of both sludge were dominated by the acetoclastic methanogen the proportion of methanogenic pathways f ac aa and f h2 aa in the adm1 was re set according to this phenomenon 3 4 simulation of methane production first the sludge composition in the adm1 was modified based on the results of the instrumental analysis and sequential extraction the microbial diversity based on 16s rrna gene sequence analysis was then used to confirm the initial concentration of degraders in the adm1 in addition the distribution of the corresponding bacterial and archaeal functional communities at the end of ad day 47 was used to modify the acidogenic and methanogenic pathways the kinetic parameters of the adm1 were calibrated using batch experiments making the adm1 more applicable for the simulation of the ad of sludge taking the wwtp s2 sludge as an example the setting and modification of the relevant parameters in the default adm1 the adm1 with modified fractions of the organic components of was adm1 mfo and the adm1 with full parameter modification for was adm1 fpm are shown in table 3 3 4 1 modification of the stoichiometric parameters based on instrumental analysis the disintegration products of xc were re divided according to the results of the sequential extraction and instrumental analysis with the coefficient f product substrate in the adm1 modified the value of f xi xc was established according to the proportion of ash content 1 vss tss and the value of f si xc was generally established as 0 00 0 02 huete et al 2006 the sludge wwtp s2 was used as an example and the stoichiometric parameters of the disintegration products of xc were modified as f si xc 0 02 f xi xc 0 45 f ch xc 0 07 f li xc 0 01 and f pr xc 0 45 in addition the proportion of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis and acetoclastic methanogenesis pathways f h2 aa f ac aa was adjusted based on the results of the 16s rrna gene sequence analysis as shown in table 3 3 4 2 calibration of the kinetic parameters based on the batch experiment the results of the batch experiments were utilized to calibrate the kinetic parameters the hydrolysis parameters were modified according to changes in the concentration of proteins carbohydrates lipids and their corresponding hydrolysates and were further re modified according to the ratio of the relative abundances of their degraders obtained by the 16s rrna gene sequence analysis finally the value of khyd ch khyd pr and khyd li were modified to 1 5 1 125 and 0 25 respectively km ac and km aa were modified according to the changes in the amino acids and acetate concentrations and methane contents that were determined to be 36 and 26 respectively 3 4 3 inputs for the initial components the measured concentration of the tcod of the sludge was input into the adm1 model as xc and the measured concentration of dissolved substances in the sludge was directly input into the model as ss for the subsequent acidogenesis and methanogenesis processes the initial concentration scale of each degrader was preliminarily determined using the parameter estimation in west and then the initial concentration was established according to the relative proportion of the microbial abundance using the 16s rrna gene sequence analysis 3 4 4 validation of the methodology adm1 variables input and simulation the v liq and v gas of the ad reactor in the model were set at 0 0005 m3 and 0 0001 m3 respectively according to the experimental setup the cumulative methane production of the wwtp s2 sludge simulated by the default adm1 the adm1 mfo and the adm1 fpm were compared with the results of the laboratory measurements fig 9 the adm1 mfo simulation curve was a visibly better fit than the default adm1 and the adm1 fpm simulation curve was the best fit to the experimental curve indicating that the adm1 fpm effectively simulated the methane production of the sludge in addition the changes in simulation of vfas and methane production during anaerobic digestion of the four sludge samples using the adm1 fpm model are shown in fig s6 compared with figs 7 and s5 the simulated cumulative methane productions of the four types of sludge are consistent with the experimental trends these indicate that the adm1 fpm model can simulate the methanogenesis process of anaerobic digestion of sludge very well the variation trends of simulated and measured vfas are basically consistent but the simulated values are higher than the experimental values in the model the biodegradable fraction of xc was completely hydrolyzed and acidified to vfas whereas in the actual anaerobic digester some slowly biodegradable fraction might not be completely degraded and converted to vfas within 50 days of the anaerobic digestion this may lead to deviations between the measured vfas and the simulated values the specific reasons need to be further explored and the model needs to be correspondingly improved in our further work 3 4 5 model evaluation the simulation results of the adm1 fpm fit the measured values well with tic 0 049 and this was an 89 8 reduction compared to the original default adm1 model tic 0 480 and an 85 2 reduction compared to the adm1 mfo tic 0 330 the smaller tic value meant better goodness of fit thus the adm1 fpm is a good prediction tool for the ad of was of course there are still some shortcomings in the present adm1 fpm model which need to be improved for instance the value of f xi xc was assumed to approximate the proportion of ash content 1 vss tss in fact the ash fraction is not exactly equivalent to the xi currently in most published studies the inert fraction xi is obtained by subtracting the biochemical methane potential bmp from the total cod fisgativa et al 2020 this method is more accurate but also complex and time consuming in this study considering that proteins carbohydrates and lipids are the main organic substances in was and xi is not involved in the subsequent anaerobic digestion conversion processes hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis in the adm1 model to simplify the determination procedure of xi xi fraction was assumed to approximate the ash fraction 1 vss tss the simulation results indicated that this had little influence on the modeling of methane production in the future work better xi fractionation methods need to be explored to improve the model accuracy 4 conclusions in this work a method for the quick fractionation of the organic components proteins carbohydrates and lipids of the was was developed and the initial content of microbial degraders was established these contributed to improvements in the simulation of the ad process using adm1 the combination of ftir xps and nmr analyses achieved rapid and accurate qualitative and quantitative determinations of the organic fractions of the sludge with 25 0 50 0 proteins 2 0 10 0 carbohydrates and 0 9 2 3 lipids for the four types of sludge the results of the sequential chemical extraction and 3d fluorescence analysis verified the reliability of the above instrumental analysis the measurements were then used to modify the stoichiometric coefficient f product xc of the adm1 for the fractionation of organic components the concentrations of the initial degrader fractions of the adm1 were determined using a 16s rrna gene sequence analysis the highest abundance of macromolecular degrading bacteria proteobacteria bacteroidota firmicutes saprospiraceae and rhodanobacteraceae 60 was found and various types of hydrolytic or acidogenic bacteria

14833,while most household surfactants are biodegradable in aerobic conditions their biodegradability may obscure their environmental risks the presence of surfactants in a biological treatment process can lead to the proliferation of antimicrobial resistance genes arg in the biomass surfactants can be cationic anionic or zwitterionic and these different classes may have different effects on the proliferation arg cationic hexadecyltrimethyl ammonium ctab anionic sodium dodecyl sulfate sds and zwitterionic 3 decyldimethylammonio propanesulfonate inner salt daps were used to represent the three classes of surfactants in domestic household clean up products this study focused on the removal of these surfactants by the o2 based membrane biofilm reactor o2 mbfr for hotspot scenarios 1 mm and how the three classes of surfactants affected the microbial community s structure and arg given sufficient o2 delivery the mbfr provided at least 98 surfactant removal the presence and biodegradation for each surfactant uniquely shaped the biofilms microbial communities and the presence of arg ctab had by far the strongest impact and the higher arg abundance in particular pseudomonas and stenotrophomonas the two main genera in the biofilm treating ctab were highly correlated to the abundance of arg for efflux pumps and antibiotic inactivation ctab also led to more functional genes relevant to the type iv secretion system and protection against oxidative stress which also could encourage horizontal gene transfer our findings highlight that the biodegradation of quaternary ammonium surfactants while beneficial can pose public health concerns from its ability to promote the proliferation of arg graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords surfactants

households biodegradable is viewed as environmentally friendly examples are quaternary ammonium compounds qac which are surfactants widely used as detergents fabric softeners and biocides since the 1960s blasco et al 2003 because of how they are used most surfactants end up in domestic wastewater that is subjected to biological treatment although most surfactants are biodegradable in aerobic conditions blasco et al 2003 a too short solids retention time srt and surfactant toxicity can lead to incomplete removal and impaired treatment performance tezel et al 2006 furthermore qac become recalcitrant in anoxic and anaerobic conditions and their strong adsorption can result in qac accumulation in the biosolids zhang et al 2015 resistance to qac is a key to microorganisms success in overcoming qac toxicity and achieving their full removal in a biological process defense mechanisms include modifying the outer membrane omp and porins to keep qac from entering the cells using efflux pumps to remove qac from inside the cells and qac biodegradation tezel and pavlostathis 2015 important qac biodegrading bacteria are pseudomonas aeruginosa and stenotrophomonas maltophilia which harbor resistance to qac when exposed to qac luo et al 2021 voumard et al 2020 of immediate relevance to this work o2 based membrane biofilm reactors o2 mbfr with sufficient o2 delivery successfully biodegraded up to 400 mg l hexadecyltrimethyl ammonium ctab by attaining a suitably long srt and enriching for ctab resistant bacteria lai et al 2017a luo et al 2021 microbial resistance to qac can be a double edged sword because it also can lead to the spreading of antimicrobial resistance genes arg arg in mobile genetic elements mge such as plasmids can proliferate within microbial communities via horizontal gene transfer hgt frost et al 2005 partridge et al 2018 coincident arg proliferation was reported for qac degrading biofilm probably because plasmids carrying args were vehicles for disseminating resistance genes bennett 2008 lai et al 2017a luo et al 2021 the type iv secretion system t4ss mediates horizontal gene transfer and contributes to arg dissemination on plasmids juhas et

2012 wallden et al 2010 p aeruginosa is one of the well known bacteria with p type t4ss hu et al 2012 oxidative stress is positively correlated with replication of plasmid dna and the frequency of horizontal transfer kotewicz et al 2003 wegrzyn and wegrzyn 2002 one protection mechanisms against oxidative stress is superoxide dismutase sod which neutralizes reactive oxygen species ros nakata et al 2011 widely used surfactants can have positive negative and zwitterionic charges palmer and hatley 2018 how surfactant charge affects community selection and antimicrobial resistance is largely unknown although some interactions with microorganisms have been identified for example positively charged surfactants tend to bind the negatively charged functional groups in cell membranes and surfactants present at concentrations greater than their critical micelle concentrations cmc can disrupt the cell membrane i e 1 mm hexadecyltrimethyl ammonium ctab are used for lipid extraction in microalgal biotechnology lai et al 2017b in either case the changes in membrane properties may trigger the formation of ros and accelerate hgt blázquez et al 2012 ceragioli et al 2010 tezel and pavlostathis 2015 another phenomenon is that metabolites from surfactant biotransformation may have their own impacts on microbial community structure and function however the comparison among the three classes surfactants has not yet been studied identifying arg in a mixed species community is challenging but metagenomic approaches are making their identification more tractable hendriksen et al 2019 sun et al 2021 in particular shallow metagenomics which is more affordable than deep shotgun metagenomics and is a rapid detection strategy for species and gene level information has been applied to investigate the occurrence and diversity of arg and arb hillmann et al 2018 liu et al 2021 different from previous antimicrobial resistance studies which focused on the microbial response upon exposure to an antimicrobial chemical our study focused on understanding how the surfactants affected the microbial communities particularly including how the communities responded to surfactant induced stress thus the over arching goal of this research was to understand the impacts of three widely used surfactants with similar compound structures but different ionic properties i e cationic hexadecyltrimethyl ammonium ctab anionic sodium dodecyl sulfate sds and zwitterionic 3 decyldimethylammonio propanesulfonate inner salt daps specific goals are to identify relationships among surfactant types metabolites community structure arg and the potential hgt of arg the results provide guidance for biologically treating these compounds while evaluating concerns about the proliferation of antimicrobial resistance bacteria arb 2 materials and methods 2 1 medium preparation surfactants ctab sds and daps were purchased from sigma aldrich usa each was evaluated at 1 mmol l

correlation efficiency r2 matrix wold et al 1987 3 results and discussion 3 1 biodegradation of the surfactants in the o2 mbfrs surfactant removal efficiency by the o2 mbfrs the three identical o2 mbfrs were fed with 1 mm of ctab sds or daps each with a 12 h hrt for 15 days as shown in fig 1 98 of ctab and sds was removed from the first day after reactor start up the daps concentration began to decline after about 4 days and it was biodegraded to below the detection limit by 9 days table 1 summarizes the steady state performance of the three reactors steady state removals exceeded 98 in all reactors which corresponds to 0 02 mm in the effluent while the o2 mbfrs could totally remove the three surfactants effluent cod was 100 400 mg l which gave cod removal fluxes of 7 3 3 7 and 3 9 g m2 day for ctab sds and daps respectively the o2 pressure of 2 5 psig 1 17 atm provided an o2 delivery capacity 2 5 fold higher than maximum o2 requirement for complete oxidation of the surfactants thus the mbfrs were not o2 limited lai et al 2017a sahinkaya et al 2011 the residual cod presumably was dominated by metabolites e g trimethylamine tma and palmitic acid from ctab biodegradation nishiyama et al 1995 and dodecanol 1 ol as intermediate product for sds biodegradation ambily and jisha 2014 hosseini et al 2007 marchesi et al 1994 although a daps biodegradation pathway has not been documented choline and betaine have been identified as metabolites figs s2 s3 3 2 bacterial community structures the biofilm community structure was shifted by input of cationic anionic or zwitterionic surfactant fig 2 a shows the community structure genus level for biofilm attached to fibers denoted by a and biomass suspended in the liquid phase denoted by s an abundant genus across the three surfactants was pseudomonas especially in the biofilm samples previous studies have shown that pseudomonas is an effective surfactant biodegrading bacterium cheng et al 2018 lai et al 2017a however the dominant species reported in fig 2b 1 in the biofilms varied among the surfactants thus shallow metagenomic sequencing revealed that the surfactant s charge played an important role in community selection looking closely at the bacteria with ctab treatment s maltophilia 17 for attached biofilm and 5 for suspension and p saponiphila 14 for attached biofilm and 19 for suspension biofilm were the most abundant species probably because they can biodegrade cationic surfactants boonchan et al 1998 lang et al 2010 these two species together with the other another major species in the biofilm p aeruginosa hancock and speert 2000 are well known antibiotic resistant bacteria of human health concern some species belonging to the acidovorax spp and achromobacter spp also may carry arg isler et al 2020 singleton et al 2016 in the biofilm exposed to sds a species able to biodegrade linear alkylbenzene sulfonates p nitroreducens was dominant and is inherently resistant to beta lactams fig 2b 2 asok and jisha 2013 aswathi et al 2021 another two abundant species p knackmussi and d ginsengisoli which have not been studied for sds biodegradation are able to oxidize variety of organic substrates such as polyethylene and methionine hou et al 2022 jung et al 2009 the dominant species in the biofilm 32 degrading daps belonged to a possible biodegrader of linear alkylbenzenes sulfonates phenylobacterium fig 2b 3 ke et al 2003 p sichuanensis 10 was identified from hospital sewage where bacteria could be potentially exposed to disinfectant chemicals and acquire arg qin et al 2019 higher abundance may suggest their metabolic potentials to biodegradation of or resistance to daps and its metabolic products in summary the differences in chemical structures including the charge group among the surfactants led to divergent metabolic pathways for biodegradation that shaped the biofilm communities this is probably because known arb were found in all three communities but ctab led to the highest abundance and variety of arb 5 species summing to 47 furthermore the dominant species in the biofilm degrading ctab p aeruginosa and s maltophilia were not dominant 2 in sds and daps treatments surfactants led to different communities in the suspended biomass among the three surfactants only the biofilm degrading ctab had a similar community in its attached biofilm and suspended biomass the sum of p saponiphila p aeruginosa and s maltophilia was maintained at 48 for attached biofilm and suspended biomass for ctab with sds the sum of p knackmussi d ginsengisoli and p nitroreducen decreased from 22 in the attached biofilm to 0 9 in the suspended biomass cupriavidus malaysiensis a novel species known to produce polyhydroxyalkanoates was the most abundant species 11 in the suspended biomass norhafini et al 2019 similar to sds the most abundant species in the attached biofilm phenylobacterium spp and p sichuanensis degrading daps were only 0 5 in the suspended biomaass the abundant species in the suspended phase c malaysiensis 8 and gordonia malaquae 7 are not known to carry arg or cause disease however mycobacterium immunogenu 7 is a novel species associated with clinical disease and antimicrobial resistance selvaraju et al 2008 wilson et al 2001 based on the composition of the suspended biomass ctab had the highest potential for proliferating arg particularly because high risk species were in its suspended phase although mycobacterium immunogenum was found in the suspended biomass exposed to daps its abundance 7 was much lower than the total abundance of arb in the suspended biomass exposed to ctab 48 the discrepancy between attached biofilm and suspended biomass may be ascribed to bacteria being inclined to develop as a biofilm when experiencing stress conditions i e p aeruginosa poole et al 1993 3 3 antimicrobial resistance genes in the biofilm active in ctab degradation fig 3 a summarizes the arg counts for ctab c sds s and daps d in the attached a and suspension s biofilms with an inoculum sample for comparison ctab had about 2000 counts per million reads cpm of arg in attached and suspended biomass a value 3 fold higher than in the inoculum 670 cpm the lower arg counts in the biofilm biodegrading sds 1070 cpm and daps 315 cpm suggest that anionic and zwitterionic surfactants exerted relatively minor selective pressure to enrich arg compared to ctab furthermore arg levels remained at similarly low levels for sds and daps biofilms when they were exposed to higher input cod concentrations this is shown in table s1 suspended biomass exposed to ctab had a slightly higher arg abundance than the attached biofilm in contrast suspended biomasses exposed to sds and daps maintained arg levels as low as in the inoculum 600 670 cpm and lower than control group fed with glucose 1000 cpm in addition suspended biomass exposed to sds had fewer arg 60 of the attached biofilm an abundance of genes for efflux pumps has been reported in multiple studies with cationic surfactants suggesting that efflux pump probably pump the surfactant out of bacteria luo et al 2021 mima et al 2009 in a case of ctab the amr family of efflux pumps in the attached and suspended biomass was clustered into the resistance nodulation cell division rnd family 77 which may be ascribed to the presence of p aeruginosa and s maltophilia lin et al 2014 mima et al 2009 notably reduced permeability to antibiotics associated with the outer membrane johnson et al 2012 was identified only in the biofilm greater arg in the biofilm degrading ctab may have been caused by ctab exerting strong selection pressure for bacteria that harbor arg thus the biofilm with high arg also showed consistently high abundance of arb particularly p aeruginosa and s maltophilia the arg present in plasmids were estimated using a homology based random forest classifier that identified plasmid sequences in the assembled bacterial genomes pellow et al 2020 pradier et al 2021 the bioinformatic assay is documented in detail in the si they are plotted by the black line in fig 3a the attached and suspended biomasses had similar plasmid arg abundances over the whole genome for ctab and sds the suspended biomass exposed to ctab had the greatest arg in plasmids 165 cpm which probably elevated arg proliferation it is likely that the cationic surfactant increased the transfer of antibiotic resistance plasmids to other bacteria chen et al 2017 as ctab led to high transcripts of genes associated with horizonal gene transfer i e type vi pilus luo et al 2021 3 4 horizontal gene transfer potential in the biofilm exposure to surfactants functional genes associated with hgt have been linked to the type iv secretion systems that enable conjugal transfer along with proteins that improve the integrity of the outer membrane and mitigate oxidative stress andersson and hughes 2014 type iv secretion system t4ss plasmids t4ss is involved in the formation of trans envelope machinery and a dna exchange pilus filloux 2010 juhas et al 2008 among the t4ss tra trb genes had the largest counts fig 4 a the trb genes encode proteins essential for rp4 plasmids p type which probably originated from p aeruginosa and s maltophilia haase et al 1995 schröder and lanka 2005 p type t4ss also is encoded by genes virb1 11 and vird which were 2 to 20 fold greater in biofilms degrading ctab than in the inoculum the enrichment of genes related to p t4ss suggests that p type t4ss carried by p aeruginosa and s maltophilia were major vehicles for arg transfer hu et al 2012 nas et al 2019 youenou et al 2015 ctab resulted in cellular oxidative damage higher oxidative stress and higher potential for horizontal gene transfer as shown in fig 4 b the abundance change of lps related genes in daps was 1 8 fold higher than the inoculum which was lower than biofilm exposed to ctab 2 3 fold over the inoculum but higher than the biofilm exposed to sds 1 5 fold over the inoculum similarly omp genes ompw omph omp31 associated with maintaining membrane integrity and preventing antibiotic penetration were 2 to 4 fold higher than the inoculum for biofilm exposed to ctab daps and sds delcour 2009 zhang et al 2021 this trend ctab daps sds may relate to changes in membrane integrity since ctab and daps have a positively charged functional group while sds does not herrera et al 2017 luo et al 2021 the cationic parts of ctab and daps could have bound to outer membrane lipopolysaccharide and presumably this triggered biofilm and suspended biomasses to have antimicrobial resistance johnson et al 2012 poole 2012 the biofilm contained two to three orders of magnitude more biomass than what was in suspension lai et al 2017a but the suspension which was exposed to a higher concentration of ctab harbored high levels of lps related and omp genes although the opposite was true for daps genes conferring resistance to oxidative stress sod1 fe mn family and sod2 cu zn family were enriched after surfactant exposure and the abundances of sod in attached biofilms were in trend of ctab daps sds inoculum these results suggest that the bacteria used sod to counteract oxidative stress and ctab induced the largest oxidative stress general stress regulator rpos which prevents dna damage from oxidative stress baharoglu et al 2013 nuss et al 2009 also was 2 fold higher with ctab 3 5 surfactant type shifted the biofilm community and its arg fig 5 a shows correlations among the dominant species arg genes related to hgt and performance of reactors the degrees of correlation are presented in table s1 the main species in the biofilm degrading ctab p aeruginosa p saponiphila and acidovorax spp were highly correlated with efflux pumps r2 0 92 another species in the biofilm degrading ctab s maltophilia also was correlated with efflux pump r2 0 68 correspondingly the cationic surfactant with its tertiary amine was associated with arg coding for tolerance to and biodegradation of ctab particularly in pseudomonas and stenotrophomonas oxidative stress sod and membrane integrity lip genes were highly related r2 0 7 to each other which suggests the membrane damage may have triggered the oxidative stress blázquez et al 2012 ceragioli et al 2010 tezel and pavlostathis 2015 a high correlation between sod and tra trb r2 0 97 and a moderate correlation between rpos and virb vird r2 0 69 suggest that oxidative stress led to horizontal gene transfer of plasmid arg through p type t4ss particularly relatively higher arg in plasmids estimated in the biofilm degrading ctab probably were due to community selection and induced horizontal gene transfer via oxidative stress linking the analyses of the microbial community arg and hgt fig 5b presents a schematic of cellular responses to surfactant stress among the three surfactants cationic ctab was more likely to attack the cellular membrane having a net negative charge and disrupt membrane integrity which triggered higher oxidative stress sod which then induced more sod arg in general and hgt potential via t4ss plasmid transfer furthermore cellular defense mechanisms also included surfactant export from the cells via efflux pumps and inactivation of surfactants also we validated that the shifts were dominated by the class of surfactant not by ctab having a higher cod content per mole we fed higher concentrations of the anionic and zwitterionic surfactants so that their cod concentrations were greater than the value of 1 mm ctab the results are summarized in si table s1 which clearly shows that no dramatic shifts in community structure or arg content with higher cod the pca in figure s5 reinforces the lack of effect of cod as the clusters are based on the types of surfactants thus the cod findings underscore the dominant role of charge on community structure and arg 4 conclusion the environmental impact of surfactants used in households should not be overlooked even though they are biodegradability this study showed that 98 removal of three common surfactants added at 1 mm could be achieved using an o2 mbfr with 12 h hrt but the surfactant s charge shaped the microbial communities and their arg pseudomonas and stenotrophomonas the two main genera in the biofilm treating ctab were highly correlated to the abundance of arg for efflux pumps and antibiotic inactivation ctab also led to more functional genes relevant to the type iv secretion system and protection against oxidative stress which could potentially encourage horizontal gene transfer a key finding here is that positively charged ctab had greater impacts than negatively charged sds or dual charged daps which means that the use of ctab presents the greatest public health concerns among the tested surfactants thus the discharge of biodegradable surfactants especially cationic surfactants can create public health concerns through their ability to promote the proliferation of arg and arb supporting information extended information including experimental setup analytic method for metabolic analysis metabolite outcomes amr family in biofilm degrading ctab

al 2011 widely used surfactants can have positive negative and zwitterionic charges palmer and hatley 2018 how surfactant charge affects community selection and antimicrobial resistance is largely unknown although some interactions with microorganisms have been identified for example positively charged surfactants tend to bind the negatively charged functional groups in cell membranes and surfactants present at concentrations greater than their critical micelle concentrations cmc can disrupt the cell membrane i e 1 mm hexadecyltrimethyl ammonium ctab are used for lipid extraction in

pavlostathis 2015 another phenomenon is that metabolites from surfactant biotransformation may have their own impacts on microbial community structure and function however the comparison among the three classes surfactants has not yet been studied identifying arg in a mixed species community is challenging but metagenomic approaches are making their identification more tractable hendriksen et al 2019 sun et al 2021 in particular shallow metagenomics which is more affordable than deep shotgun metagenomics and is a rapid detection strategy for species and gene level information has been applied to investigate the occurrence and diversity of arg and arb hillmann et al 2018 liu et al 2021 different from previous antimicrobial resistance studies which focused on the microbial response upon exposure to an antimicrobial chemical our study focused on understanding how the surfactants affected the microbial communities particularly including how the communities responded to surfactant induced stress thus the over arching goal of this research was to understand the impacts of three widely used surfactants with similar compound structures but different ionic properties i e cationic

correlation efficiency r2 matrix wold et al 1987 3 results and discussion 3 1 biodegradation of the surfactants in the o2 mbfrs surfactant removal efficiency by the o2 mbfrs the three identical o2 mbfrs were fed with 1 mm of ctab sds or daps each with a 12 h hrt for 15 days as shown in fig 1 98 of ctab and sds was removed from the first day after reactor start up the daps concentration began to decline after about 4 days and it was biodegraded to below the detection limit by 9 days table 1 summarizes the steady state performance of the three reactors steady state removals exceeded 98 in all reactors which corresponds to 0 02 mm in the effluent while the o2 mbfrs could totally remove the three surfactants effluent cod was 100 400 mg l which gave cod removal fluxes of 7 3 3 7 and 3 9 g m2 day for ctab sds and daps respectively the o2 pressure of 2 5 psig 1 17 atm provided an o2 delivery capacity 2 5 fold higher than maximum o2 requirement for complete oxidation of the surfactants thus the mbfrs were not o2 limited lai et al 2017a sahinkaya et al 2011 the residual cod presumably was dominated by metabolites e g trimethylamine tma and palmitic acid from ctab biodegradation nishiyama et al 1995 and dodecanol 1 ol as intermediate product for sds biodegradation ambily and jisha 2014 hosseini et al 2007 marchesi et al 1994 although a daps biodegradation pathway has not been documented choline and betaine have been identified as metabolites figs s2 s3 3 2 bacterial community structures the biofilm community structure was shifted by input of cationic anionic or zwitterionic surfactant fig 2 a shows the community structure genus level for biofilm attached to fibers denoted by a and biomass suspended in the liquid phase denoted by s an abundant genus across the three surfactants was pseudomonas especially in the biofilm samples previous studies have shown that pseudomonas is an effective surfactant biodegrading bacterium cheng et al 2018 lai et al 2017a however the dominant species reported in fig 2b 1 in the biofilms varied among the surfactants thus shallow metagenomic sequencing revealed that the surfactant s charge played an important role in community selection looking closely at the bacteria with ctab treatment s maltophilia 17 for attached biofilm and 5 for suspension and p saponiphila 14 for attached biofilm and 19 for suspension biofilm were the most abundant species probably because they can biodegrade cationic surfactants boonchan et al 1998 lang et al 2010 these two species together with the other another major species in the biofilm p aeruginosa hancock and speert 2000 are well known antibiotic resistant bacteria of human health concern some species belonging to the acidovorax spp and achromobacter spp also may carry arg isler et al 2020 singleton et al 2016 in the biofilm exposed to sds a species able to biodegrade linear alkylbenzene sulfonates p nitroreducens was dominant and is inherently resistant to beta lactams fig 2b 2 asok and jisha 2013 aswathi et al 2021 another two abundant species p knackmussi and d ginsengisoli which have not been studied for sds biodegradation are able to oxidize variety of organic substrates such as polyethylene and methionine hou et al 2022 jung et al 2009 the dominant species in the biofilm 32 degrading daps belonged to a possible biodegrader of linear alkylbenzenes sulfonates phenylobacterium fig 2b 3 ke et al 2003 p sichuanensis 10 was identified from hospital sewage where bacteria could be potentially exposed to disinfectant chemicals and acquire arg qin et al 2019 higher abundance may suggest their metabolic potentials to biodegradation of or resistance to daps and its metabolic products in summary the differences in chemical structures including the charge group among the surfactants led to divergent metabolic pathways for biodegradation that shaped the biofilm communities this is probably because known arb were found in all three communities but ctab led to the highest abundance and variety of arb 5 species summing to 47 furthermore the dominant species in the biofilm degrading ctab p aeruginosa and s maltophilia were not dominant 2 in sds and daps treatments surfactants led to different communities in the suspended biomass among the three surfactants only the biofilm degrading ctab had a similar community in its attached biofilm and suspended biomass the sum of p saponiphila p aeruginosa and s maltophilia was maintained at 48 for attached biofilm and suspended biomass for ctab with sds the sum of p knackmussi d ginsengisoli and p nitroreducen decreased from 22 in the attached biofilm to 0 9 in the suspended biomass cupriavidus malaysiensis a novel species known to produce polyhydroxyalkanoates was the most abundant species 11 in the suspended biomass norhafini et al 2019 similar to sds the most abundant species in the attached biofilm phenylobacterium spp and p sichuanensis degrading daps were only 0 5 in the suspended biomaass the abundant species in the suspended phase c malaysiensis 8 and gordonia malaquae 7 are not known to carry arg or cause disease however mycobacterium immunogenu 7 is a novel species associated with clinical disease and antimicrobial resistance selvaraju et al 2008 wilson et al 2001 based on the composition of the suspended biomass ctab had the highest potential for proliferating arg particularly because high risk species were in its suspended phase although mycobacterium immunogenum was found in the suspended biomass exposed to daps its abundance 7 was much lower than the total abundance of arb in the suspended biomass exposed to ctab 48 the discrepancy between attached biofilm and suspended biomass may be ascribed to bacteria being inclined to develop as a biofilm when experiencing stress conditions i e p aeruginosa poole et al 1993 3 3 antimicrobial resistance genes in the biofilm active in ctab degradation fig 3 a summarizes the arg counts for ctab c sds s and daps d in the attached a and suspension s biofilms with an inoculum sample for comparison ctab had about 2000 counts per million reads cpm of arg in attached and suspended biomass a value 3 fold higher than in the inoculum 670 cpm the lower arg counts in the biofilm biodegrading sds 1070 cpm and daps 315 cpm suggest that anionic and zwitterionic surfactants exerted relatively minor selective pressure to enrich arg compared to ctab furthermore arg levels remained at similarly low levels for sds and daps biofilms when they were exposed to higher input cod concentrations this is shown in table s1 suspended biomass exposed to ctab had a slightly higher arg abundance than the attached biofilm in contrast suspended biomasses exposed to sds and daps maintained arg levels as low as in the inoculum 600 670 cpm and lower than control group fed with glucose 1000 cpm in addition suspended biomass exposed to sds had fewer arg 60 of the attached biofilm an abundance of genes for efflux pumps has been reported in multiple studies with cationic surfactants suggesting that efflux pump probably pump the surfactant out of bacteria luo et al 2021 mima et al 2009 in a case of ctab the amr family of efflux pumps in the attached and suspended biomass was clustered into the resistance nodulation cell division rnd family 77 which may be ascribed to the presence of p aeruginosa and s maltophilia lin et al 2014 mima et al 2009 notably reduced permeability to antibiotics associated with the outer membrane johnson et al 2012 was identified only in the biofilm greater arg in the biofilm degrading ctab may have been caused by ctab exerting strong selection pressure for bacteria that harbor arg thus the biofilm with high arg also showed consistently high abundance of arb particularly p aeruginosa and s maltophilia the arg present in plasmids were estimated using a homology based random forest classifier that identified plasmid sequences in the assembled bacterial genomes pellow et al 2020 pradier et al 2021 the bioinformatic assay is documented in detail in the si they are plotted by the black line in fig 3a the attached and suspended biomasses had similar plasmid arg abundances over the whole genome for ctab and sds the suspended biomass exposed to ctab had the greatest arg in plasmids 165 cpm which probably elevated arg proliferation it is likely that the cationic surfactant increased the transfer of antibiotic resistance plasmids to other bacteria chen et al 2017 as ctab led to high transcripts of genes associated with horizonal gene transfer i e type vi pilus luo et al 2021 3 4 horizontal gene transfer potential in the biofilm exposure to surfactants functional genes associated with hgt have been linked to the type iv secretion systems that enable conjugal transfer along with proteins that improve the integrity of the outer membrane and mitigate oxidative stress andersson and hughes 2014 type iv secretion system t4ss plasmids t4ss is involved in the formation of trans envelope machinery and a dna exchange pilus filloux 2010 juhas et al 2008 among the t4ss tra trb genes had the largest counts fig 4 a the trb genes encode proteins essential for rp4 plasmids p type which probably originated from p aeruginosa and s maltophilia haase et al 1995 schröder and lanka 2005 p type t4ss also is encoded by genes virb1 11 and vird which were 2 to 20 fold greater in biofilms degrading ctab than in the inoculum the enrichment of genes related to p t4ss suggests that p type t4ss carried by p aeruginosa and s maltophilia were major vehicles for arg transfer hu et al 2012 nas et al 2019 youenou et al 2015 ctab resulted in cellular oxidative damage higher oxidative stress and higher potential for horizontal gene transfer as shown in fig 4 b the abundance change of lps related genes in daps was 1 8 fold higher than the inoculum which was lower than biofilm exposed to ctab 2 3 fold over the inoculum but higher than the biofilm exposed to sds 1 5 fold over the inoculum similarly omp genes ompw omph omp31 associated with maintaining membrane integrity and preventing antibiotic penetration were 2 to 4 fold higher than the inoculum for biofilm exposed to ctab daps and sds delcour 2009 zhang et al 2021 this trend ctab daps sds may relate to changes in membrane integrity since ctab and daps have a positively charged functional group while sds does not herrera et al 2017 luo et al 2021 the cationic parts of ctab and daps could have bound to outer membrane lipopolysaccharide and presumably this triggered biofilm and suspended biomasses to have antimicrobial resistance johnson et al 2012 poole 2012 the biofilm contained two to three orders of magnitude more biomass than what was in suspension lai et al 2017a but the suspension which was exposed to a higher concentration of ctab harbored high levels of lps related and omp genes although the opposite was true for daps genes conferring resistance to oxidative stress sod1 fe mn family and sod2 cu zn family were enriched after surfactant exposure and the abundances of sod in attached biofilms were in trend of ctab daps sds inoculum these results suggest that the bacteria used sod to counteract oxidative stress and ctab induced the largest oxidative stress general stress regulator rpos which prevents dna damage from oxidative stress baharoglu et al 2013 nuss et al 2009 also was 2 fold higher with ctab 3 5 surfactant type shifted the biofilm community and its arg fig 5 a shows correlations among the dominant species arg genes related to hgt and performance of reactors the degrees of correlation are presented in table s1 the main species in the biofilm degrading ctab p aeruginosa p saponiphila and acidovorax spp were highly correlated with efflux pumps r2 0 92 another species in the biofilm degrading ctab s maltophilia also was correlated with efflux pump r2 0 68 correspondingly the cationic surfactant with its tertiary amine was associated with arg coding for tolerance to and biodegradation of ctab particularly in pseudomonas and stenotrophomonas oxidative stress sod and membrane integrity lip genes were highly related r2 0 7 to each other which suggests the membrane damage may have triggered the oxidative stress blázquez et al 2012 ceragioli et al 2010 tezel and pavlostathis 2015 a high correlation between sod and tra trb r2 0 97 and a moderate correlation between rpos and virb vird r2 0 69 suggest that oxidative stress led to horizontal gene transfer of plasmid arg through p type t4ss particularly relatively higher arg in plasmids estimated in the biofilm degrading ctab probably were due to community selection and induced horizontal gene transfer via oxidative stress linking the analyses of the microbial community arg and hgt fig 5b presents a schematic of cellular responses to surfactant stress among the three surfactants cationic ctab was more likely to attack the cellular membrane having a net negative charge and disrupt membrane integrity which triggered higher oxidative stress sod which then induced more sod arg in general and hgt potential via t4ss plasmid transfer furthermore cellular defense mechanisms also included surfactant export from the cells via efflux pumps and inactivation of surfactants also we validated that the shifts were dominated by the class of surfactant not by ctab having a higher cod content per mole we fed higher concentrations of the anionic and zwitterionic surfactants so that their cod concentrations were greater than the value of 1 mm ctab the results are summarized in si table s1 which clearly shows that no dramatic shifts in community structure or arg content with higher cod the pca in figure s5 reinforces the lack of effect of cod as the clusters are based on the types of surfactants thus the cod findings underscore the dominant role of charge on community structure and arg 4 conclusion the environmental impact of surfactants used in households should not be overlooked even though they are biodegradability this study showed that 98 removal of three common surfactants added at 1 mm could be achieved using an o2 mbfr with 12 h hrt but the surfactant s charge shaped the microbial communities and their arg pseudomonas and stenotrophomonas the two main genera in the biofilm treating ctab were highly correlated to the abundance of arg for efflux pumps and antibiotic inactivation ctab also led to more functional genes relevant to the type iv secretion system and protection against oxidative stress which could potentially encourage horizontal gene transfer a key finding here is that positively charged ctab had greater impacts than negatively charged sds or dual charged daps which means that the use of ctab presents the greatest public health concerns among the tested surfactants thus the discharge of biodegradable surfactants especially cationic surfactants can create public health concerns through their ability to promote the proliferation of arg and arb supporting information extended information including experimental setup analytic method for metabolic analysis metabolite outcomes amr family in biofilm degrading ctab

14834,the recent discovery of complete ammonia oxidation comammox bacteria has fundamentally upended the traditional two step nitrification conception but their functional importance in wastewater treatment plants wwtps is still poorly understood this study investigated distributions of comammox nitrospira ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa in activated sludge samples collected from 25 full scale wwtps using quantitative pcr qpcr and 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing our results revealed that comammox nitrospira ubiquitously occurred in all of 25 wwtps and even outnumbered aob and aoa with an average abundance of 1 183 orders of magnitude higher in 19 wwtps moreover dna based stable isotope probing dna sip assays validated that comammox nitrospira actively participated in ammonia oxidation in the three microcosms seeding with activated sludge from three typical wwtps in which the ratios of comammox amoa to aob amoa were at the range of 1 10 10 100 and 100 respectively phylogenetic analysis in heavy fractions further indicated that nitrospira nitrosa n nitrosa was the dominant and active species we quantified the contribution of ammonia oxidizers based on the currently available kinetic parameters of the representative species and found that comammox made major contributions to ammonia oxidation than other nitrifiers 5 106 times that of aob the findings not only demonstrate the ubiquitous occurrence of comammox but also highlight their functional dominance in ammonia oxidation in wwtps graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords comammox nitrospira wastewater treatment dna sip ammonia oxidation ammonia oxidizing bacteria data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction nitrification responsible for the conversion of ammonia to nitrate via nitrite is the crucial step of the global nitrogen cycle jetten et al 1997 marcel et al 2018 mooshammer et al 2014 traditionally nitrification is a two step process where ammonia is first oxidized to nitrite by ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and or archaea aoa and subsequently to nitrate by nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob in 2006 a hypothesis that a microbial process single handedly completes two step nitrification by a single organism was proposed costa et al 2006 then the conjecture was fully confirmed by the successful enrichment of complete ammonia oxidation comammox nitrospira in 2015 daims et al 2015 van kessel et al 2015 and the subsequent isolation of pure comammox bacterial strain in 2017 kits et al 2017 different from canonical nitrospira comammox nitrospira harbor a complete set of nitrifying genes including ammonia monooxygenase amo hydroxylamine dehydrogenase hao and nitrite oxidoreductase nxr daims et al 2015 van kessel et al 2015 palomo et al 2018 the discovery of comammox process has significantly advanced our understanding of nitrification and highlighted comammox nitrospira as key players of nitrifying microorganisms to date comammox nitrospira have been widely detected in various engineering and natural ecosystems such as agricultural soils pjevac et al 2017 wastewater treatment systems zhao et al

black and just 2018 recently increasing studies have assessed the quantitative relationships and community structure of ammonia oxidizing microorganisms including aoa aob and comammox nitrospira in wwtps in particular several studies reported that comammox nitrospira numerically dominate over aob in wwtps according to the quantitative analysis of amoa genes he et al 2022 pjevac et al 2017 spasov et al 2020 wang et al 2018 however the current understanding of ammonia oxidation capacity and nitrification contribution of comammox in wwtps is still lacking it is less rigorous to reveal the contribution by only considering the numerical abundance but neglecting the gene expression and enzymatic activity black and just 2018 gonzalez martinez et al 2016 pan et al 2018a given the fact that the abundance of nitrifying microorganisms may not always be positively correlated with their nitrification activity mußmann et al 2011 for example niu et al 2013 proved aoa made a more contribution than that of aob towards nitrification in drinking water treatment plants dwtps even though aob were more abundant than aoa pan et al 2018a also documented aoa played a more significant role in nitrification of wwtps under low temperature conditions despite the numerical dominance of aob revealed by dna based stable isotope probing dna sip technology which could decipher the functional bacteria in complicated environments dai et al 2022 radajewski et al 2000 obviously it could not always provide an integrated insight into the contribution of different microbes to the ammonia oxidation process by investigating the abundance or transcripts of amoa genes of ammonia oxidizing microorganisms aoms the objectives of this study were to i explore the distribution of comammox and the numerical relation among aoms in full scale wwtps ii reveal the activity and contribution of comammox to nitrification process comparing with canonical nitrifiers in typical wwtps and iii identify the active comammox communities and provide insights into their ammonia oxidation capabilities and contributions to nitrification in wwtps to achieve these aims the current study collected activated sludge samples from 25 full scale wwtps quantitative pcr qpcr were employed to quantify and compare the abundances of comammox nitrospira aob and aoa moreover dna sip assays in conjunction with amplicon sequencing by targeting both 16s rrna gene and functional gene amoa were performed to validate the contribution of comammox nitrospira and aob to ammonia oxidation in three microcosms seeding with activated sludge from three typical wwtps 2 materials and methods 2 1 activated sludge samples collection the location of the surveyed 25 wwtps was depicted in fig s1 and their detailed information including water quality and operation parameters was presented in table s1 each sample was taken in duplicate on three random positions in the aeration tank from 25 wwtps and pooled thoroughly to a total volume of approximately 50 ml then the mixed samples were immediately transported to the laboratory on ice afterward a part of samples was stored at 20 c before dna extraction while the other set was stored at 4 c until further physicochemical analysis 2 2 dna extraction and quantitative pcr assays dna was extracted using fast dna spin kit mp biomedicals usa from activated sludge samples according to the manufacturer s instructions the abundances of comammox aoa and aob amoa genes were quantified with specific primer pairs table s2 in applied biosystems 7500 system

and 5 μl rnase free double distilled water ddh2o standard curves were generated by ten fold serially diluted plasmids containing the corresponding gene fragments as template the target gene copies in the unit volume template were calculated through the standard curves and the generated ct values meanwhile negative controls were conducted with ddh2o without dna template the amplification protocols were summarized in table s2 2 3 dna sip incubation in order to explore the contribution of comammox nitrospira to ammonia oxidation in wwtps three typical wwtps with the ratio of the abundance of comammox amoa to aob amoa in the ranges of 1 to 10 ws 10 to 100 nj and higher than 100 xjh were selected to perform the dna sip incubation to fully simulate the influent ammonia loading in actual wwtps the incubation was established in 250 ml serum bottles filled with resuspended activated sludge using 90 ml synthetic wastewater 0 1 g l mgcl2 0 02 g l cacl2 0 5 g l kcl 1 0 g l nacl 0 2 g l

set at 200 280 and 300 mg l calculated with the measured mlss in the bottles of 2850 2300 and 2350 mg l in xjh nj and ws respectively after sedimentation 10 ml supernatant was discharged at the last two hours of each day to monitor the nh 4 n no 2 n and no 3 n concentration the headspace of the bottles was replaced by synthetic air 80 n2 and 20 o2 every day to remove co2 and maintain the stable oxic condition three sets of treatments were set up for each sample including nah12co3 0 8 g l group nah13co3 0 8 g l group and nah13co3 0 8 g l group in the presence of 10 mg l allylthiourea atu with ammonia oxidation process to be inhibited all the treatments were performed in parallel and incubated in shaking incubators at constant parameters of 100 rpm and 25 c samples were taken for subsequent molecular analysis at day 0 15 and 30 respectively 2 4 isopycnic centrifugation and gradient fractionation cscl density gradient ultracentrifugation was performed as described in a previous study neufeld et al 2007 for each treatment about 3 0 μg of the dna extract was mixed with cscl solution and gb buffer to achieve an initial density of 1 725 g ml by using the measurement of a digital refractometer atago inc tokyo japan then dna mixture was added into 5 1 ml polyallomer quick seal centrifuge tubes by syringe the isopycnic density centrifugation was performed at 177 000 g in the pvt100 rotor hitachi inc tokyo japan for 44 h at 20 c a total of 12 gradient fractions were equally generated by injecting sterile water from the top of the ultracentrifuge tube using an injection pump the volume of each fraction was 425 μl of which 70 μl was used for the measurement of refractive index subsequently the dna fractions were precipitated by adding two volumes polyethylene glycol peg 6000 and 1 μg glycogen after washing by 500 μl 70 ethanol dna was dissolved into 30 μl te buffer neufeld et al 2007 2 5 illumina miseq sequencing and bioinformatic analysis the genomic dna

the universal primer 515fmodf 806rmodr for both the total dna during the sip incubation and 13c labeled dna okano et al 2004 comammox amoa genes in the total dna and 13c labeled dna were also amplified using the specific primers comammox amoa comamoa f r wang et al 2018 subsequently the purified pcr amplicons were sequenced on the illumina miseq platform shanghai majorbio bio pharm technology co ltd then chimera free sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units otus based on 97 for 16s rrna and 90 for amoa similarity using the usearch version 1 8 0 phylogenetic neighbor joining trees were constructed by mega 7 0 with representative sequences and reference sequences retrieved from the ncbi database kumar et al 2016 bootstrap analysis was utilized to test the relative confidence of the neighbor joining tree based on 1000 replicates 2 6 statistical analyses spearman s correlation analysis was applied to estimate the relationships between the environmental factors and the abundances of aoms redundancy analysis rda was performed to reveal the correlations between active otus and environmental factors one way analysis of variance anova and non parametric fried man test were performed to investigate the possible statistical differences tian et al 2021 2 7 data availability all the raw sequences of 16s rrna and comammox amoa genes were deposited to the

aoa in activated sludge samples collected from 25 full scale wwtps as shown in fig 1 the abundances of aob amoa gene varied from 1 4 0 11 106 to 2 7 0 16 109 copies g ss with an average of 2 3 0 07 108 copies g ss for aoa amoa the copy numbers ranged from 1 3 0 52 105 to 9 5 0 46 108 copies copies g ss with an average of 8 6 0 65 107 copies g ss notably comammox amoa gene ranging from 4 6 0 56 106 to 3 3 0 14 109 copies g ss averaging at 6 5 0 15 108 copies g ss were significantly higher than aob and aoa amoa genes in 19 wwtps p 0 01 the highest ratio of comammox amoa to aob amoa reached 183 fold in the sample sjs fig 1 the results clearly showed the numerical dominance of comammox bacteria in most of wwtps reaching 1 3 orders of magnitude higher than aob and aoa 3 2 abundance variations of aoms during the stable isotope labeling incubation to elucidate the contribution of comammox nitrospira to ammonia oxidation three wwtps characterized by the ratio of comammox to aob as 1 10 ws 10 100 nj and 100 xjh were selected to conduct the dna sip incubation during the 30 day incubation the daily supplemented nh 4 n 200 280 and 300 mg n l for xjh nj and ws was depleted and no 2 n in effluent almost maintained at low levels 0 8 mg n l indicating complete nitrification performance fig s2 the population sizes of comammox and aob in 12c 13c labeled microcosms and atu treatment microcosms were determined via qpcr by targeting the amoa genes on days 0 15 and 30 as shown in fig 2 the copy numbers of comammox amoa genes increased from 3 24 0 72 108 to 2 96 0 49 109 1 09 0 02 109 to 1 95 0 14 109 1 80 0 27 108 to 8 39 0 04 108 copies g ss in the microcosms of xjh nj and ws after 30 day incubation namely increasing 9 1 1 8 and 4 7 fold respectively fig 2a as for aob amoa the abundance increased from 6 84 0 48 106 4 84 0 73 107 1 81 0 06 108 copies g ss on day 0 to 9 23 3 12 107 8 35 1 37 107 and 4 04 0 42 108 copies g ss on day 30 in xjh nj and ws namely increasing 13 5 1 7 and 2 2 fold respectively fig 2b in contrast aoa amoa genes dropped to below the detection limit 1 0 104 copies g ss from the perspective of the relative abundances of these aom comammox increased from 0 297 to 0 814 0 327 to 0 689 and 0 042 to 0 175 on day 30 in xjh nj and ws microcosms respectively by contrast the relative abundance of aob was significantly lower than that of comammox especially in xjh and nj which were 1 2 orders of magnitude lower at the end of the incubation similarly the variation trends of the abundances of comammox and aob amoa genes in 12c control microcosms were consistent with that in 13c labeled microcosms fig 2c and d the addition of atu prevented the increase of both comammox and aob amoa gene abundances in all the three microcosms fig 2e and f suggesting that the energy for the 13c assimilation of comammox and aob cells was gained from the ammonia oxidation process 3 3 active nitrifying communities across entire buoyant density fractions isopycnic density gradient ultracentrifugation of the total dna extract was performed to resolve the 13c labeled dna from the 12c native dna in the three microcosms after incubation for 15 and 30 days the peaks of 12c and 13c treatment dna occurred in the light and heavy fractions with buoyant densities of 1 720 and 1 735 g ml respectively fig 3 subsequently comammox and aob amoa genes in the entire buoyant density fractions of each sample were quantified to reveal the isotopic labeling process during the incubation obviously comammox and aob amoa genes were only detected in the light fractions in the 12c and atu amended treatments in the 30 day incubation on day 15 about 82 3 and 50 9 comammox amoa were observed in heavy fractions in xjh and nj whereas only 20 1 of comammox amoa shifted to the heavy fractions in ws with a relatively lower assimilating rate meanwhile 34 2 10 8 and 22 3 of aob amoa genes were detected in the heavy fractions in xjh nj and ws respectively on day 30 the 13c labeled comammox finally accounted for 96 2 85 9 and 81 4 of total comammox amoa gene abundance in xjh nj and ws respectively while 13c labeled aob represented 30 8 76 4 and 74 1 of the total aob amoa gene in the three microcosms 3 4 taxonomic composition of 13c labeled ammonia oxidizers to study the taxonomic composition of aoms in 13c labeled fractions in samples collected on days 15 and 30 this study employed high throughput amplicon sequencing by targeting both 16s rrna and comammox amoa genes a total of 4495 582 16s rrna and 72 250 comammox amoa reads were obtained the putative aob and comammox amoa sequences were selected for further analysis fig 4 table s3 in the lineage ii of nitrospira cluster from 16s rrna taxonomy nitrospira nitrosa n nitrosa affiliated otu otu 4 occupied 100 of active comammox members in xjh and nj on both day 15 and 30 whereas it contributed to 63 0 on day 15 and 97 4 on day 30 in ws in which the remaining 37 1 and 2 6 were affiliated to nitrospira nitrificans n nitrificans otu 387 fig s3 similar results of 13c labeled comammox amoa genes were obtained that n nitrosa cluster accounted for 100 of 13c labeled comammox amoa genes in xjh and nj and increased from 75 4 on day 15 to 98 3 on day 30 in ws the n nitrificans cluster represented by otu 8 was only detected in ws and this taxon accounted for 24 6 on day 15 and decreased to 1 7 on day 30 although the 16s rrna gene cannot strictly distinguish comammox nitrospira and canonical nitrospira daims et al 2016 the virtually unanimous conclusions drawn from the 16s rrna and comammox amoa genes suggested the robustness of the taxonomic classification results fig 5 a among the 8 otus affiliated with aob 16s rrna gene nitrosomonas oligotropha was the sole cluster detected in xjh fig s4 this cluster accounted for 50 0 and 66 7 of active aob members in nj and ws on day 15 then increased to 87 8 in nj but decreased to 56 3 in ws on day 30 respectively nitrosomonas europaea cluster were only detected in nj on day 15 8 33 while they disappeared on day 30 nitrosomonas communis cluster comprised 7 2 of 13c labeled aob communities in nj on day 30 nitrosospira cluster was observed a significant increase in nj and ws from day 15 to day 30 redundancy analysis rda was performed to reveal the correlations between the environmental factors and active comammox or aob members fig 5b the dominant comammox species n nitrosa cluster were positively related to mixed liquor suspended solids mlss and sludge retention time srt while n nitrificans negatively correlated to do the majority of aob species nitrosomonas oligotropha nitrosomonas europaea nitrosomonas communis in nj and ws showed positive correlations with temperature t and negative correlations with srt in addition the bacterial co occurrence patterns of active comammox and aob members were explored via network analysis fig 5c in the network comammox and aob species exhibited 5 positive and 21 negative correlation edges while aob members showed frequent interactions with each other accounting for 74 5 of total correlations 102 edges additionally frequent interactions between comammox and aob clusters could be found in which n nitrosa mainly exhibited negative correlation with nitrosomonas oligotropha 3 5 relative contributions of active ammonia oxidizers to confirm the relative contribution of comammox and aob in wwtps the respective ammonia oxidation activity of aom was calculated according to their active abundance and ammonia oxidation kinetic data estimated by the previously reported comammox and aob species the comammox species was also represented by n nitrosa enriched from activated sludge in this study see supplementary information besides the reported nitrospira kreftii n kreftii and nitrospira inopinata n inopinata table 1 the ammonia oxidation rates of comammox were calculated as 24 1 16 9 and 21 3 μmol n g ss h in xjh nj and ws by using n nitrosa as the representative comammox bacteria which were slightly higher than those estimated by the other two comammox species in contrast the ammonia oxidation rates of aob were only 0 2 0 5 and 3 5 μmol n g ss h in xjh nj and ws respectively the ratios of contribution to ammonia oxidation of comammox to aob reached as high as 106 33 and 6 in xjh nj and ws even taking n inopinata as the representative comammox species the ratios still achieved 16 5 and 0 9 in the three wwtps fig 6 4 discussion 4 1 comammox nitrospira outnumber all other nitrifiers in 19 wwtps ammonia oxidizers play a central role in removing ammonium in domestic and industrial wastewater thus preventing the excessive ammonium discharge to the surrounding environment generally aoa are scarce in wwtps due to the ammonia rich condition and inhibition by copper complexation with organic matters in municipal wastewater gwak et al 2020 whereas they are more prevalent in oligotrophic ecosystems such as drinking water soil and marine bartelme et al 2017 prosser and nicol 2008 wuchter et al 2006 consistently the copy numbers of aoa amoa gene in most of wwtps in this study displayed several orders of magnitude lower than that of aob fan et al 2019 gao et al 2014 mußmann et al 2011 recently pan et al 2018b revealed the dominant role of aob in ammonia oxidation in wwtps by using dna sip technology however few studies took the participation of comammox into consideration which may have overestimated the importance of aob in nitrification process in wwtps using qpcr 16s rrna gene sequencing and amoa functional gene sequencing our results demonstrated that comammox were detected in all 25 wwtps and numerically dominant in 19 of them which is consistent with the recent studies showing the dominance of comammox in wwtps roots et al 2019 wang et al 2018 zhao et al 2019 in addition the dna sip incubation adopting continuous injection mimicked the continuous influent condition of the three tested wwtp which avoided the initial high but gradually decreasing nh 4 n loading as occurred in the wwtps employing sbr process therefore the high abundance ratios of comammox to aob amoa genes in heavy fractions table 1 illustrated that comammox nitrospira in the three microcosms propagated rapidly and maintained their numerical advantage during the dna sip incubation this would also happen in the original wwtps considering the continuous injection would develop similar microbial community in the microcosms and the original wwtps high throughput sequencing provided a detailed identification of active comammox and aob from the heavy fractions in the three microcosms comammox consist of clade a and clade b based on the phylogenetic analysis of amoa gene daims et al 2015 van kessel et al 2015 in this study n nitrosa cluster from clade a predominated the active comammox species while n nitrificans took only tiny percentages consistently several previous studies have demonstrated that the widely distributed comammox bacteria in wastewater treatment systems mostly belonged to clade a cluster and closely related to n nitrosa camejo et al 2017 cotto et al 2020 wang et al 2018 in comparison comammox nitrospira belonging to clade b cluster did not appear in the heavy fractions which have been found to be widely distributed in oligotrophic environments such as drinking water treatment systems agricultural and forest soils daims et al 2015 pjevac et al 2017 xu et al 2020 this could be ascribed to the fact that clade b nitrospira encodes amt type ammonia transporter with a higher ammonia affinity than rh type transporter encoded by clade a which promoted clade b to prefer the oligotrophic habitats rather than wwtps koch et al 2019 for the active aob members nitrosomonas oligotropha was the dominant aob cluster in the heavy fractions while nitrosomonas europaea and nitrosospira cluster played minor roles in the ammonia oxidation process this niche separation was attributed to their different substrate kinetics that nitrosomonas oligotropha has a lower half saturation constant and a higher affinity to ammonia compared with other nitrosomonas species gabriele et al 2010 kits et al 2017 4 2 comammox nitrospira dominate the ammonia oxidation for tested wwtps in addition to the abundance quantification it is more critical to evaluate ammonia oxidation capacity and contribution of the three aom counterparts in wwtps dna sip relies on cell proliferation that can reveal the real nitrification driver that have assimilated 13c substrates in the complex environmental samples which is more accurate to assess the role of aom in nitrification by determining the abundance of active ammonia oxidizers by simulating the operating mode and conditions of the actual wwtps to the greatest extent in microcosms this current study explored the contribution of comammox nitrospira to ammonia oxidation process based on the dna sip incubation and activity analysis in three typical wwtps additionally the pcoa analysis showed that samples from the same wwtp at different incubation time day 0 15 and 30 gathered together fig s5 indicating the dna sip incubation barely changed the general microbial community and the results enable to reveal the active ammonia oxidizers in situ the significant 13c labeling of comammox nitrospira suggested the functional dominance of comammox in ammonia oxidation by contrast aoa without numerical advantage could be hardly detected in the heavy fractions after the sip incubation suggesting a weak carbon fixation and ammonia oxidation activity which coincided with the scarce aoa detected in xjh and nj the equivalent abundance of aoa to aob occurred in ws was possibly attributed to the survived heterotrophic aoa species which may gain energy from organic compounds except for inorganic carbons mußmann et al 2011 to estimate the ammonia oxidation rates of comammox nitrospira the enriched comammox species including n nitrosa in this study a highly enriched n kreftii and a purely cultured n inopinata were used to evaluate the cell specific activity of comammox kits et al 2017 sakoula et al 2021 n inopinata as the only available pure cultured comammox species is rarely detected in wastewater treatment systems daims et al 2015 instead n nitrosa may have a closer cell specific activity to n kreftii compared with n inopinata as it is much phylogenetically closer to n kreftii fig s6 thus the calculated ammonia oxidation rates of n nitrosa enriched in this study could better reflect the ammonia oxidation capacity of the dominant n nitrosa in wwtps in situ in addition our previous study assessing the expression activities of ammonia oxidizers in several wwtps some of which were the same as those in this study found that the transcriptional abundance of comammox amoa gene was unexpectedly higher than aob nearly 24 fold and aoa further corroborating the current dna sip results zheng et al 2019 nevertheless considering the transcript results of aoms may be biased due to metabolizing organic compounds dna sip was considered as a more reliable method that enables in depth investigation of active ammonia oxidizers in the complex wastewater environment 4 3 factors determining the dominance of comammox nitrospira in wwtps ammonia as the common substrate is the most important factor determining the niche differentiation of aoms kinetic analysis suggested n inopinata has an extremely high affinity for ammonia with an apparent km as low as 0 063 0 01 μm nh3 and n kreftii exhibited even a higher ammonia affinity km 0 040 0 01 μm nh3 demonstrating the oligotrophic growing habitat of comammox bacteria kits et al 2017 it could be tempting to speculate that the dominant species n nitrosa also possess a high affinity for ammonia though the kinetic characteristics of n nitrosa have not yet been documented it could be also inferred that n nitrosa possess a higher affinity than n oligotropha which has the highest ammonia affinity in aob species reflected by the higher abundances in the heavy fractions although wastewater treatment systems are recognized as an ammonia rich environment a low ammonia concentration in the mixed liquor is always achieved especially in the continuous flow nitrifying systems which would create a favorable circumstance for these ammonia high affinity organisms oxygen is another key factor influencing the metabolism of comammox nitrospira which have been found to survive and enrich in environments with low do in previous studies lawson and lucker 2018 roots et al 2019 zheng et al 2022 notably there are currently no available data about the oxygen kinetics for comammox nitrospira and the cognition of high oxygen affinity was mainly inferred from previous studies in which several wwtps operated under hypoxic conditions achieved stable nitrification and harbored a large proportion of comammox nitrospira how et al 2019 de sotto and bae 2020 comammox nitrospira encode the bd type terminal oxidase with a high oxygen affinity koch et al 2019 and the key enzymes of the reductive tricarboxylic acid rtca cycle ketoglutarate synthase and pyruvate synthase for co2 fixation were sensitive to o2 campbell et al 2006 however the predominant active comammox species n nitrosa was positively correlated with do in wastewater treatment systems which was in contrast with previous studies beach and noguera 2019 roots et al 2019 it is notable that the multiple influencing factors in wwtps may together play a crucial role in affecting the niche differentiation of aom and their microbial community compositions in this study mlss and srt are the most influential factors that positive correlated with the abundance of active comammox based on the thermodynamic and metabolic pathway modeling comammox has been proved to be prevalent under long srt conditions due to their slower specific growth rate compared to aob cotto et al 2020 kits et al 2017 the xjh wwtp employs aao and mbr process which harbors high mlss and srt which facilitate the retain of slow growing chemoautotrophic nitrifying bacteria camejo et al 2017 and roots et al 2019 also enriched the comammox nitrospira in sbr with long srt 88 d and 90 d it could be speculated that the ammonia and oxygen gradients created by a thick sludge floc with a high mlss allows comammox nitrospira to cope with high ammonia and oxygen exposure which could provide appropriate niche for the propagation of comammox nitrospira and help them to survive in the substrate rich environment further the comammox genome contains 2 2 hemoglobin type ii trhb2 a protein associated with the functions of oxygen scavenging and oxidative stress resistance that has never been detected in aoa and rare in aob only present in nitrosospira spp which could protect comammox nitrospira to survive under high oxygen concentrations ouellet et al 2007 palomo et al 2018 torge et al 2009 in addition comammox seems to well adapt to complex environmental conditions with luxuriant organic and inorganic substrates as well as frequent changes of ammonium loading and do which may be the potential niche determinants for comammox nitrospira in wwtps palomo et al 2022 van kessel et al 2015 our results highlight the contribution of comammox nitrospira to nitrification and suggest it is urgently needed to re evaluate nitrification contributions by including comammox nitrospira as one of obligated ammonia oxidizers moreover considering comammox nitrospira have the high affinity for ammonia and the putative high affinity for oxygen it is beneficial to achieve low residual ammonia concentration and low energy consumption in wwtps further studies on ammonia and oxygen kinetics of more representative comammox strains are necessary to interpret the specific niche characteristic in complex environments 5 conclusions this study investigated the distribution of comammox nitrospira and evaluated the relative contributions of comammox nitrospira to ammonia oxidation in full scale wwtps the main conclusions are as follows comammox nitrospira were widely distributed and numerical dominant in wwtps which were 1 3 orders of magnitude higher than canonical nitrifiers in 19 of 25 wwtps while aoa always kept at a low abundance in these wwtps nitrospira nitrosa from comammox clade a cluster accounted for higher than 97 4 of the active comammox species and dominated the ammonia oxidation process mlss and srt played important roles in selection of comammox nitrospira in wwtps as the oxygen gradient created by thick sludge floc allows comammox nitrospira to occupy the dominant ecological niche in wwtps with higher mlss and longer srt the predominant comammox nitrospira contributed more to ammonia oxidation process than canonical aom suggesting that comammox nitrospira functionally dominate the ammonia oxidation in the tested wwtps

14834,the recent discovery of complete ammonia oxidation comammox bacteria has fundamentally upended the traditional two step nitrification conception but their functional importance in wastewater treatment plants wwtps is still poorly understood this study investigated distributions of comammox nitrospira ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa in activated sludge samples collected from 25 full scale wwtps using quantitative pcr qpcr and 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing our results revealed that comammox nitrospira ubiquitously occurred in all of 25 wwtps and even outnumbered aob and aoa with an average abundance of 1 183 orders of magnitude higher in 19 wwtps moreover dna based stable isotope probing dna sip assays validated that comammox nitrospira actively participated in ammonia oxidation in the three microcosms seeding with activated sludge from three typical wwtps in which the ratios of comammox amoa to aob amoa were at the range of 1 10 10 100 and 100 respectively phylogenetic analysis in heavy fractions further indicated that nitrospira nitrosa n nitrosa was the dominant and active species we quantified the contribution of ammonia oxidizers based on the currently available kinetic parameters of the representative species and found that comammox made major contributions to ammonia oxidation than other nitrifiers 5 106 times that of aob the findings not only demonstrate the ubiquitous occurrence of comammox but also highlight their functional dominance in ammonia oxidation in wwtps graphical abstract image graphical abstract

for the conversion of ammonia to nitrate via nitrite is the crucial step of the global nitrogen cycle jetten et al 1997 marcel et al 2018 mooshammer et al 2014 traditionally nitrification is a two step process where ammonia is first oxidized to nitrite by ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and or archaea aoa and subsequently to nitrate by nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob in 2006 a hypothesis that a microbial process single handedly completes two step nitrification by a single organism was proposed costa et al 2006 then the conjecture was fully confirmed by the successful enrichment of complete ammonia oxidation comammox nitrospira in 2015 daims et al 2015 van kessel et al 2015 and the subsequent isolation of pure comammox bacterial strain in 2017 kits et al 2017 different from canonical nitrospira comammox nitrospira harbor a complete set of nitrifying genes including ammonia monooxygenase amo hydroxylamine dehydrogenase hao and nitrite oxidoreductase nxr daims et al 2015 van kessel et al 2015 palomo et al 2018 the discovery of comammox process has significantly advanced our understanding of nitrification and highlighted comammox nitrospira as key players of nitrifying microorganisms to date comammox nitrospira have been widely detected in various engineering and natural ecosystems such as agricultural soils pjevac et al 2017 wastewater treatment systems zhao et al 2019 van kessel et al 2015 freshwater recirculating aquaculture system bartelme et al 2017 drinking water treatment systems wang et al 2017 groundwater biofilters gulay et al 2019 and river sediments black and just 2018 recently increasing studies have assessed the quantitative relationships and community structure of ammonia oxidizing microorganisms including aoa aob and comammox nitrospira in wwtps in particular several studies reported that comammox nitrospira numerically dominate over aob in wwtps according to the quantitative analysis of amoa genes he et al 2022 pjevac et al 2017 spasov et al 2020 wang et al 2018 however the current understanding of ammonia oxidation capacity and nitrification contribution of comammox in wwtps is still lacking it is less rigorous to reveal the contribution by only considering the numerical abundance but neglecting the gene expression and enzymatic activity black and just 2018 gonzalez martinez et al 2016 pan et al 2018a given the fact that the abundance of nitrifying microorganisms may not always be positively correlated with their nitrification activity mußmann et al 2011 for example niu et al 2013 proved aoa made a more contribution than that of aob towards nitrification in drinking water treatment plants dwtps even though aob were more abundant than aoa pan et al 2018a also documented aoa played a more significant role in nitrification of wwtps under low temperature conditions despite the numerical dominance of aob revealed by dna based stable isotope probing dna sip technology which could decipher the functional bacteria in complicated environments dai et al 2022 radajewski et al 2000 obviously it could not always provide an integrated insight into the contribution of different microbes to the ammonia oxidation process by investigating the abundance or transcripts of amoa genes of ammonia oxidizing microorganisms aoms the objectives of this study were to i explore the distribution of comammox and the numerical relation among aoms in full scale wwtps ii reveal the activity and contribution of comammox to nitrification process comparing with canonical nitrifiers in typical wwtps and iii identify the active comammox communities and provide insights into their ammonia oxidation capabilities and contributions to nitrification in wwtps to achieve these aims the current study collected activated sludge samples from 25 full scale wwtps quantitative pcr qpcr were employed to quantify and compare the abundances of comammox nitrospira aob and aoa moreover dna sip assays in conjunction with amplicon sequencing by targeting both 16s rrna gene and functional gene amoa were performed to validate the contribution of comammox nitrospira and aob to ammonia oxidation in three microcosms seeding with activated sludge from three typical wwtps 2 materials and methods 2 1 activated sludge samples collection the location of the surveyed 25 wwtps was depicted in fig s1 and their detailed information including water quality and operation parameters was presented in table s1 each sample was taken in duplicate on three random positions in the aeration tank from 25 wwtps and pooled thoroughly to a total volume of approximately 50 ml then the mixed samples were immediately transported to the laboratory on ice afterward a part of samples was stored at 20 c before dna extraction

set at 200 280 and 300 mg l calculated with the measured mlss in the bottles of 2850 2300 and 2350 mg l in xjh nj and ws respectively after sedimentation 10 ml supernatant was discharged at the last two hours of each day to monitor the nh 4 n no 2 n and no 3 n concentration the headspace of the bottles was replaced by synthetic air 80 n2 and 20 o2 every day to remove co2 and maintain the stable

molecular analysis at day 0 15 and 30 respectively 2 4 isopycnic centrifugation and gradient fractionation cscl density gradient ultracentrifugation was performed as described in a previous study neufeld et al 2007 for each treatment about 3 0 μg of the dna extract was mixed with cscl solution and gb buffer to achieve an initial density of 1 725 g ml by using the measurement of a digital refractometer atago inc tokyo japan then dna mixture was added into 5 1 ml polyallomer quick seal centrifuge tubes by syringe the isopycnic density centrifugation was performed at 177 000 g in the

aoa in activated sludge samples collected from 25 full scale wwtps as shown in fig 1 the abundances of aob amoa gene varied from 1 4 0 11 106 to 2 7 0 16 109 copies g ss with an average of 2 3 0 07 108 copies g ss for aoa amoa the copy numbers ranged from 1 3 0 52 105 to 9 5 0 46 108 copies copies g ss with an average of 8 6 0 65 107 copies g ss notably comammox amoa gene ranging from 4 6 0 56 106 to 3 3 0 14 109 copies g ss averaging at 6 5 0 15 108 copies g ss were significantly higher than aob and aoa amoa genes in 19 wwtps p 0 01 the highest ratio of comammox amoa to aob amoa reached 183 fold in the sample sjs fig 1 the results clearly showed the numerical dominance of comammox bacteria in most of wwtps reaching 1 3 orders of magnitude higher than aob and aoa 3 2 abundance variations of aoms during the stable isotope labeling incubation to elucidate the contribution of comammox nitrospira to ammonia oxidation three wwtps characterized by the ratio of comammox to aob as 1 10 ws 10 100 nj and 100 xjh were selected to conduct the dna sip incubation during the 30 day incubation the daily supplemented nh 4 n 200 280 and 300 mg n l for xjh nj and ws was depleted and no 2 n in effluent almost maintained at low levels 0 8 mg n l indicating complete nitrification performance fig s2 the population sizes of comammox and aob in 12c 13c labeled microcosms and atu treatment microcosms were determined via qpcr by targeting the amoa genes on days 0 15 and 30 as shown in fig 2 the copy numbers of comammox amoa genes increased from 3 24 0 72 108 to 2 96 0 49 109 1 09 0 02 109 to 1 95 0 14 109 1 80 0 27 108 to 8 39 0 04 108 copies g ss in the microcosms of xjh nj and ws after 30 day incubation namely increasing 9 1 1 8 and 4 7 fold respectively fig 2a as for aob amoa the abundance increased from 6 84 0 48 106 4 84 0 73 107 1 81 0 06 108 copies g ss on day 0 to 9 23 3 12 107 8 35 1 37 107 and 4 04 0 42 108 copies g ss on day 30 in xjh nj and ws namely increasing 13 5 1 7 and 2 2 fold respectively fig 2b in contrast aoa amoa genes dropped to below the detection limit 1 0 104 copies g ss from the perspective of the relative abundances of these aom comammox increased from 0 297 to 0 814 0 327 to 0 689 and 0 042 to 0 175 on day 30 in xjh nj and ws microcosms respectively by contrast the relative abundance of aob was significantly lower than that of comammox especially in xjh and nj which were 1 2 orders of magnitude lower at the end of the incubation similarly the variation trends of the abundances of comammox and aob amoa genes in 12c control microcosms were consistent with that in 13c labeled microcosms fig 2c and d the addition of atu prevented the increase of both comammox and aob amoa gene abundances in all the three microcosms fig 2e and f suggesting that the energy for the 13c assimilation of comammox and aob cells was gained from the ammonia oxidation process 3 3 active nitrifying communities across entire buoyant density fractions isopycnic density gradient ultracentrifugation of the total dna extract was performed to resolve the 13c labeled dna from the 12c native dna in the three microcosms after incubation for 15 and 30 days the peaks of 12c and 13c treatment dna occurred in the light and heavy fractions with buoyant densities of 1 720 and 1 735 g ml respectively fig 3 subsequently comammox and aob amoa genes in the entire buoyant density fractions of each sample were quantified to reveal the isotopic labeling process during the incubation obviously comammox and aob amoa genes were only detected in the light fractions in the 12c and atu amended treatments in the 30 day incubation on day 15 about 82 3 and 50 9 comammox amoa were observed in heavy fractions in xjh and nj whereas only 20 1 of comammox amoa shifted to the heavy fractions in ws with a relatively lower assimilating rate meanwhile 34 2 10 8 and 22 3 of aob amoa genes were detected in the heavy fractions in xjh nj and ws respectively on day 30 the 13c labeled comammox finally accounted for 96 2 85 9 and 81 4 of total comammox amoa gene abundance in xjh nj and ws respectively while 13c labeled aob represented 30 8 76 4 and 74 1 of the total aob amoa gene in the three microcosms 3 4 taxonomic composition of 13c labeled ammonia oxidizers to study the taxonomic composition of aoms in 13c labeled fractions in samples collected on days 15 and 30 this study employed high throughput amplicon sequencing by targeting both 16s rrna and comammox amoa genes a total of 4495 582 16s rrna and 72 250 comammox amoa reads were obtained the putative aob and comammox amoa sequences were selected for further analysis fig 4 table s3 in the lineage ii of nitrospira cluster from 16s rrna taxonomy nitrospira nitrosa n nitrosa affiliated otu otu 4 occupied 100 of active comammox members in xjh and nj on both day 15 and 30 whereas it contributed to 63 0 on day 15 and 97 4 on day 30 in ws in which the remaining 37 1 and 2 6 were affiliated to nitrospira nitrificans n nitrificans otu 387 fig s3 similar results of 13c labeled comammox amoa genes were obtained that n nitrosa cluster accounted for 100 of 13c labeled comammox amoa genes in xjh and nj and increased from 75 4 on day 15 to 98 3 on day 30 in ws the n nitrificans cluster represented by otu 8 was only detected in ws and this taxon accounted for 24 6 on day 15 and decreased to 1 7 on day 30 although the 16s rrna gene cannot strictly distinguish comammox nitrospira and canonical nitrospira daims et al 2016 the virtually unanimous conclusions drawn from the 16s rrna and comammox amoa genes suggested the robustness of the taxonomic classification results fig 5 a among the 8 otus affiliated with aob 16s rrna gene nitrosomonas oligotropha was the sole cluster detected in xjh fig s4 this cluster accounted for 50 0 and 66 7 of active aob members in nj and ws on day 15 then increased to 87 8 in nj but decreased to 56 3 in ws on day 30 respectively nitrosomonas europaea cluster were only detected in nj on day 15 8 33 while they disappeared on day 30 nitrosomonas communis cluster comprised 7 2 of 13c labeled aob communities in nj on day 30 nitrosospira cluster was observed a significant increase in nj and ws from day 15 to day 30 redundancy analysis rda was performed to reveal the correlations between the environmental factors and active comammox or aob members fig 5b the dominant comammox species n nitrosa cluster were positively related to mixed liquor suspended solids mlss and sludge retention time srt while n nitrificans negatively correlated to do the majority of aob species nitrosomonas oligotropha nitrosomonas europaea nitrosomonas communis in nj and ws showed positive correlations with temperature t and negative correlations with srt in addition the bacterial co occurrence patterns of active comammox and aob members were explored via network analysis fig 5c in the network comammox and aob species exhibited 5 positive and 21 negative correlation edges while aob members showed frequent interactions with each other accounting for 74 5 of total correlations 102 edges additionally frequent interactions between comammox and aob clusters could be found in which n nitrosa mainly exhibited negative correlation with nitrosomonas oligotropha 3 5 relative contributions of active ammonia oxidizers to confirm the relative contribution of comammox and aob in wwtps the respective ammonia oxidation activity of aom was calculated according to their active abundance and ammonia oxidation kinetic data estimated by the previously reported comammox and aob species the comammox species was also represented by n nitrosa enriched from activated sludge in this study see supplementary information besides the reported nitrospira kreftii n kreftii and nitrospira inopinata n inopinata table 1 the ammonia oxidation rates of comammox were calculated as 24 1 16 9 and 21 3 μmol n g ss h in xjh nj and ws by using n nitrosa as the representative comammox bacteria which were slightly higher than those estimated by the other two comammox species in contrast the ammonia oxidation rates of aob were only 0 2 0 5 and 3 5 μmol n g ss h in xjh nj and ws respectively the ratios of contribution to ammonia oxidation of comammox to aob reached as high as 106 33 and 6 in xjh nj and ws even taking n inopinata as the representative comammox species the ratios still achieved 16 5 and 0 9 in the three wwtps fig 6 4 discussion 4 1 comammox nitrospira outnumber all other nitrifiers in 19 wwtps ammonia oxidizers play a central role in removing ammonium in domestic and industrial wastewater thus preventing the excessive ammonium discharge to the surrounding environment generally aoa are scarce in wwtps due to the ammonia rich condition and inhibition by copper complexation with organic matters in municipal wastewater gwak et al 2020 whereas they are more prevalent in oligotrophic ecosystems such as drinking water soil and marine bartelme et al 2017 prosser and nicol 2008 wuchter et al 2006 consistently the copy numbers of aoa amoa gene in most of wwtps in this study displayed several orders of magnitude lower than that of aob fan et al 2019 gao et al 2014 mußmann et al 2011 recently pan et al 2018b revealed the dominant role of aob in ammonia oxidation in wwtps by using dna sip technology however few studies took the participation of comammox into consideration which may have overestimated the importance of aob in nitrification process in wwtps using qpcr 16s rrna gene sequencing and amoa functional gene sequencing our results demonstrated that comammox were detected in all 25 wwtps and numerically dominant in 19 of them which is consistent with the recent studies showing the dominance of comammox in wwtps roots et al 2019 wang et al 2018 zhao et al 2019 in addition the dna sip incubation adopting continuous injection mimicked the continuous influent condition of the three tested wwtp which avoided the initial high but gradually decreasing nh 4 n loading as occurred in the wwtps employing sbr process therefore the high abundance ratios of comammox to aob amoa genes in heavy fractions table 1 illustrated that comammox nitrospira in the three microcosms propagated rapidly and maintained their numerical advantage during the dna sip incubation this would also happen in the original wwtps considering the continuous injection would develop similar microbial community in the microcosms and the original wwtps high throughput sequencing provided a detailed identification of active comammox and aob from the heavy fractions in the three microcosms comammox consist of clade a and clade b based on the phylogenetic analysis of amoa gene daims et al 2015 van kessel et al 2015 in this study n nitrosa cluster from clade a predominated the active comammox species while n nitrificans took only tiny percentages consistently several previous studies have demonstrated that the widely distributed comammox bacteria in wastewater treatment systems mostly belonged to clade a cluster and closely related to n nitrosa camejo et al 2017 cotto et al 2020 wang et al 2018 in comparison comammox nitrospira belonging to clade b cluster did not appear in the heavy fractions which have been found to be widely distributed in oligotrophic environments such as drinking water treatment systems agricultural and forest soils daims et al 2015 pjevac et al 2017 xu et al 2020 this could be ascribed to the fact that clade b nitrospira encodes amt type ammonia transporter with a higher ammonia affinity than rh type transporter encoded by clade a which promoted clade b to prefer the oligotrophic habitats rather than wwtps koch et al 2019 for the active aob members nitrosomonas oligotropha was the dominant aob cluster in the heavy fractions while nitrosomonas europaea and nitrosospira cluster played minor roles in the ammonia oxidation process this niche separation was attributed to their different substrate kinetics that nitrosomonas oligotropha has a lower half saturation constant and a higher affinity to ammonia compared with other nitrosomonas species gabriele et al 2010 kits et al 2017 4 2 comammox nitrospira dominate the ammonia oxidation for tested wwtps in addition to the abundance quantification it is more critical to evaluate ammonia oxidation capacity and contribution of the three aom counterparts in wwtps dna sip relies on cell proliferation that can reveal the real nitrification driver that have assimilated 13c substrates in the complex environmental samples which is more accurate to assess the role of aom in nitrification by determining the abundance of active ammonia oxidizers by simulating the operating mode and conditions of the actual wwtps to the greatest extent in microcosms this current study explored the contribution of comammox nitrospira to ammonia oxidation process based on the dna sip incubation and activity analysis in three typical wwtps additionally the pcoa analysis showed that samples from the same wwtp at different incubation time day 0 15 and 30 gathered together fig s5 indicating the dna sip incubation barely changed the general microbial community and the results enable to reveal the active ammonia oxidizers in situ the significant 13c labeling of comammox nitrospira suggested the functional dominance of comammox in ammonia oxidation by contrast aoa without numerical advantage could be hardly detected in the heavy fractions after the sip incubation suggesting a weak carbon fixation and ammonia oxidation activity which coincided with the scarce aoa detected in xjh and nj the equivalent abundance of aoa to aob occurred in ws was possibly attributed to the survived heterotrophic aoa species which may gain energy from organic compounds except for inorganic carbons mußmann et al 2011 to estimate the ammonia oxidation rates of comammox nitrospira the enriched comammox species including n nitrosa in this study a highly enriched n kreftii and a purely cultured n inopinata were used to evaluate the cell specific activity of comammox kits et al 2017 sakoula et al 2021 n inopinata as the only available pure cultured comammox species is rarely detected in wastewater treatment systems daims et al 2015 instead n nitrosa may have a closer cell specific activity to n kreftii compared with n inopinata as it is much phylogenetically closer to n kreftii fig s6 thus the calculated ammonia oxidation rates of n nitrosa enriched in this study could better reflect the ammonia oxidation capacity of the dominant n nitrosa in wwtps in situ in addition our previous study assessing the expression activities of ammonia oxidizers in several wwtps some of which were the same as those in this study found that the transcriptional abundance of comammox amoa gene was unexpectedly higher than aob nearly 24 fold and aoa further corroborating the current dna sip results zheng et al 2019 nevertheless considering the transcript results of aoms may be biased due to metabolizing organic compounds dna sip was considered as a more reliable method that enables in depth investigation of active ammonia oxidizers in the complex wastewater environment 4 3 factors determining the dominance of comammox nitrospira in wwtps ammonia as the common substrate is the most important factor determining the niche differentiation of aoms kinetic analysis suggested n inopinata has an extremely high affinity for ammonia with an apparent km as low as 0 063 0 01 μm nh3 and n kreftii exhibited even a higher ammonia affinity km 0 040 0 01 μm nh3 demonstrating the oligotrophic growing habitat of comammox bacteria kits et al 2017 it could be tempting to speculate that the dominant species n nitrosa also possess a high affinity for ammonia though the kinetic characteristics of n nitrosa have not yet been documented it could be also inferred that n nitrosa possess a higher affinity than n oligotropha which has the highest ammonia affinity in aob species reflected by the higher abundances in the heavy fractions although wastewater treatment systems are recognized as an ammonia rich environment a low ammonia concentration in the mixed liquor is always achieved especially in the continuous flow nitrifying systems which would create a favorable circumstance for these ammonia high affinity organisms oxygen is another key factor influencing the metabolism of comammox nitrospira which have been found to survive and enrich in environments with low do in previous studies lawson and lucker 2018 roots et al 2019 zheng et al 2022 notably there are currently no available data about the oxygen kinetics for comammox nitrospira and the cognition of high oxygen affinity was mainly inferred from previous studies in which several wwtps operated under hypoxic conditions achieved stable nitrification and harbored a large proportion of comammox nitrospira how et al 2019 de sotto and bae 2020 comammox nitrospira encode the bd type terminal oxidase with a high oxygen affinity koch et al 2019 and the key enzymes of the reductive tricarboxylic acid rtca cycle ketoglutarate synthase and pyruvate synthase for co2 fixation were sensitive to o2 campbell et al 2006 however the predominant active comammox species n nitrosa was positively correlated with do in wastewater treatment systems which was in contrast with previous studies beach and noguera 2019 roots et al 2019 it is notable that the multiple influencing factors in wwtps may together play a crucial role in affecting the niche differentiation of aom and their microbial community compositions in this study mlss and srt are the most influential factors that positive correlated with the abundance of active comammox based on the thermodynamic and metabolic pathway modeling comammox has been proved to be prevalent under long srt conditions due to their slower specific growth rate compared to aob cotto et al 2020 kits et al 2017 the xjh wwtp employs aao and mbr process which harbors high mlss and srt which facilitate the retain of slow growing chemoautotrophic nitrifying bacteria camejo et al 2017 and roots et al 2019 also enriched the comammox nitrospira in sbr with long srt 88 d and 90 d it could be speculated that the ammonia and oxygen gradients created by a thick sludge floc with a high mlss allows comammox nitrospira to cope with high ammonia and oxygen exposure which could provide appropriate niche for the propagation of comammox nitrospira and help them to survive in the substrate rich environment further the comammox genome contains 2 2 hemoglobin type ii trhb2 a protein associated with the functions of oxygen scavenging and oxidative stress resistance that has never been detected in aoa and rare in aob only present in nitrosospira spp which could protect comammox nitrospira to survive under high oxygen concentrations ouellet et al 2007 palomo et al 2018 torge et al 2009 in addition comammox seems to well adapt to complex environmental conditions with luxuriant organic and inorganic substrates as well as frequent changes of ammonium loading and do which may be the potential niche determinants for comammox nitrospira in wwtps palomo et al 2022 van kessel et al 2015 our results highlight the contribution of comammox nitrospira to nitrification and suggest it is urgently needed to re evaluate nitrification contributions by including comammox nitrospira as one of obligated ammonia oxidizers moreover considering comammox nitrospira have the high affinity for ammonia and the putative high affinity for oxygen it is beneficial to achieve low residual ammonia concentration and low energy consumption in wwtps further studies on ammonia and oxygen kinetics of more representative comammox strains are necessary to interpret the specific niche characteristic in complex environments 5 conclusions this study investigated the distribution of comammox nitrospira and evaluated the relative contributions of comammox nitrospira to ammonia oxidation in full scale wwtps the main conclusions are as follows comammox nitrospira were widely distributed and numerical dominant in wwtps which were 1 3 orders of magnitude higher than canonical nitrifiers in 19 of 25 wwtps while aoa always kept at a low abundance in these wwtps nitrospira nitrosa from comammox clade a cluster accounted for higher than 97 4 of the active comammox species and dominated the ammonia oxidation process mlss and srt played important roles in selection of comammox nitrospira in wwtps as the oxygen gradient created by thick sludge floc allows comammox nitrospira to occupy the dominant ecological niche in wwtps with higher mlss and longer srt the predominant comammox nitrospira contributed more to ammonia oxidation process than canonical aom suggesting that comammox nitrospira functionally dominate the ammonia oxidation in the tested wwtps
