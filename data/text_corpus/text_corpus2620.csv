13100,adopting the hydrothermal method the cobalt ferrite nanocomposite was loaded onto graphene g cofe2o4 and the material thus produced was first characterized and then employed as a sonophotocatalyst to assist in the degradation of diazinon dzn at different operational parameters further response surface methodology was used for the optimization and modeling of the operational parameters from the statistical analysis of the analysis of variance anova the quadratic model was observed to give a good fit with the experimental data barring the catalyst dose p value 0 194 and the initial concentration of dzn p value 0 20 significantly affected the efficiency of the dzn degradation complete dzn degradation was achieved under the conditions of ph 3 time 100 min dzn concentration 10 mg l temperature 50 c and the g cofe2o4 dose of 0 99 g l reduction in the dzn degradation rate was observed falling below 10 during the eight consecutive cycles giving proof of the stability and adequate recyclability of the g cofe2o4 biodegradability related to the five day biochemical oxygen demand chemical oxygen demand bod5 cod ratio increased from 0 15 to 0 58 with the corresponding 90 95 total organic carbon toc and 96 41 cod being removed the toxicity evaluated using the inhibition growth rate of escherichia coli e coli showed high ability of the suggested treatment system to lower the toxicity when compared to photocatalysis and photolysis on using the analytical methods the presence of the mineral ions such as nh4 no3 so4 2 and po4 3 appeared to act as good indicators of mineralization keywords sonophotocatalytic g cofe2o4 catalyst diazinon degradation response surface methodology toxicity 1 introduction the recent decades have witnessed a significant escalation in the number and quantity of toxins produced to prevent and control plant diseases the widespread usage of chlorine and phosphorus toxins exerts harmful effects on the ecosystem over a long term posing a risk to the microorganism life damage to the central nervous and respiratory systems in animals and the eutrophication of water 1 2 extensive use has been made of diazinon c12h21n2o3ps o diethyl o 2 isopropyl 6 methylpyrimidin 4 yl thiophosphate an organophosphate insecticide for insect control in the agricultural as well as domestic milieux 3 this is a non systemic toxin easily digestible showing stability at neutral ph and is almost completely soluble in water at 40 mg l concentration at ambient temperature the diazinon at vapor pressure of 11 97 mpa and constant henry s law 1 4 10 6 atm m3 mol reveals that the present compound does not show easy volatility in both the aqueous and terrestrial environments remaining stable for several months in the environment 4 5 besides the characteristics of stability and solubility the diazinon dzn encourages surface and groundwater contamination therefore according to the classification of the world health organization who dzn is a class ii chemical which poses relative danger for all aquatic animals mammals and humans 6 therefore recently several approaches have been considered for the effective removal of these pollutants using the entire range from conventional techniques adsorption and biodegradation to advanced methodologies electro oxidation and photocatalytic processes among these photocatalysis with titanium dioxide tio2 has garnered special focus as it is economical and environmentally friendly green easy to use and inexpensive 7 however when the tio2 photocatalyst was actually applied to treat contaminated water it was not a success because separation was difficult the gap band was low and the electrons holes e h displayed rapid recombination 8 the problems cited above were overcome by some researchers who developed the use of spin ferrite magnetic nanoparticles mfe2o 4 for their characteristic features of high stability narrow gap band separation capacity simple synthesis and strong coercivity as a semiconductor cobalt ferrite cofe2o4 is composed of co2 at the tetrahedral site and fe3 at the octahedral one 9 10 during the photocatalytic reactions the cofe2o4 metal ions absorb light and the electrons are moved from the valence band to the conduction band to form the hole h this mechanism results in an increase in the e h pair for the formation of the oxidative species oxidizing the pollutants at the photocatalyst surface 11 reports from earlier studies indicate that the cofe2o4 nanoparticles are active in photodegradation enabling the removal of the organic and resistant contaminants 12 however in recent times the low degree of segregation of the charge carrier species collection and high photocorrosion rates are the limitations observed in the practical photocatalytic application of the cofe2o4 11 graphene oxide go coupled with ferrite based photocatalysts has been suggested as a solution for these issues and enhancement of the photocatalytic features as a two dimensional carbon material of sp2 bonded carbon graphene contains a wide variety of and several functional groups including the carboxyl hydroxyl and epoxy ones besides others capable of immobilizing substantial quantities of photocatalysts with appropriate dispersion 13 15 as graphene exhibits high surface area exceptional charge separation property between the π π electrons and good conductivity the cofe2o4 and graphene combination the combined particles named here g cofe2o4 enhances the electron transfer between the composite phases as well as lowers the recombination rate of the charge carrier 10 further graphene ensures long life for the photogenerated charge carriers through the provision of channels for electron movement 16 it was devi and srinivas who were responsible for the preparation of the g cofe2o4 hetero architecture nanocomposites to degrade 4 chlorophenol 16 in their demonstration the combination of reduced graphene and cofe2o4 significantly escalated the degradation rate more than when the cofe2o4 alone was used in fact he and lu used the co precipitation method to synthesize the g cofe2o4 hybrid nanoparticles they reported that the maximum degradation efficiency of malachite green dye was higher at neutral ph than at ph 5 17 in their work gan et al employed the hydrothermal method for the g cofe2o4 nanocomposite synthesis used in the photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue dye they reported that in the degradation system this photocatalyst showed long term potential 18 several research groups have reported that the adoption of a technology that could induce a synergistic effect to activate the oxidants will significantly raise the rate of environmental remediation 3 19 over the recent years sonolysis has grabbed centerstage as a chemical reaction that results from the adoption of ultrasound radiation because of it safety of usage and absence of chemical involvement 20 during the sonophotocatalytic process a combination of ultrasound and photocatalysis the ultrasound can produce large quantities of oh via acoustic cavitation 21 besides the cavitation process the removal of the by products from the active catalyst sites as well enables the catalytic sites to get regenerated through the action of turbulence and microcurrents further prior studies have recorded that the ultrasound radiation when applied in a reaction reactor can induce improvement in the processes of adsorption electron transfer decomposition of the hydrophobic part of the organic compounds and catalyst dispersion 22 in the face of these considerations only few studies have been done on the sample toxicity drawn from the sonophotocatalytic reactor besides only few observations regarding the anion and cation concentrations resulting from the complete degradation of the micropollutants are available in the earlier studies as is true for other removal techniques the photocatalytic process at its maximum level of application shows great dependence upon the operating conditions an effective method of determining the interactions between one or more response variables and the independent variables is to design the experiments adopting the response surface methodology rsm this statistical method is employed for optimizing the output variables while building the experimental models for pollutant removal the earlier studies demonstrate the fitting and pertinent efficiency of the rsm in ascertaining the optimal conditions for micropollutant removal through photocatalysis 23 24 the operational parameters in this study namely the initial ph photocatalyst dose reaction time initial dzn concentration and temperature were optimized by rsm coupled with the central composite design ccd the synthesis of the g cofe2o4 nanocomposite was accomplished using the hydrothermal technique this was then utilized as a catalyzer during the degradation of dzn via sonophotocatalysis the e coli bacterial culture was employed to investigate toxicity of the treated solution by examining eight consecutive sonophotocatalytic degradation cycles the stability and recyclability of g cofe2o4 were confirmed and an evaluation was done of the mineral ion concentration produced by the dzn degradation 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the following chemicals were purchased from sigma aldrich germany namely ferric nitrate fe no3 3 9h2o cobalt nitrate co no3 2 6h2o sodium hydroxide naoh sulfuric acid h2so4 hydrazine hydrate h2n nh2 h2o ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta isopropyl alcohol

synthetic and stock solutions were prepared using deionized water 2 2 synthesis of g cofe2o4 the g cofe2o4 nanocomposite as shown in fig 1 was synthesized using the co precipitation hydrothermal method to begin with 250 mg of go was dissolved using 100 ml of water for 4 h in an ultrasonic bath next ferric nitrate 2 g and cobalt nitrate 0 75 g were added gradually to the go solution using concentrated naoh the ph value of the mixture was adjusted to 12 and mixing was performed for 2 h at 80 c later to the go mixture 8 ml of hydrazine hydrate was added slowly to reduce the go and the black mixture finally formed was stirred at 80 c for 10 h more once cooling to ambient temperature was accomplished the solids thus separated via filtration were subjected to washing with deionized water and ethanol to ensure impurity removal last the remaining solids g cofe2o4 were placed in an oven and vacuum dried for 24 h at 60 c previous studies found that the optimal graphene content in g cofe2o4 used in the degradation systems was 22 whereas this percentage was fixed in the catalyst synthesis process of this study 25 2 3 sonophotocatalytic experiments all the experiments were conducted in a pyrex vessel reactor with a quartz plate on one side uv light irradiation was performed using a mercury lamp philips netherlands in addition an ultrasound bath sunshine ss 6508 t was used for performing the ultrasound us waves during the sonophotocatalytic process the temperature value was controlled using an external water bath a certain amount of g cofe2o4 photocatalyst 0 1 1 g l was dissolved in a solution of dzn the addition of 0 1 m sodium hydroxide and sulfuric acid was done to adjust the solution ph from 3 to 11 while sonophotocatalysis was ongoing a 10 ml of sample was drawn from the reactor at the predetermined reaction time 10 120 min then the collected samples were subjected to filtration process using a 0 22 μm filter paper to ensure separation of the nanocomposites from aqueous solution the dzn concentration in the aqueous solution was identified utilizing high performance liquid chromatography hplc kenaver company germany along with the c18 column and uv detector at 247 nm wavelength an internal diameter of 4 6 and a length of 250 mm and the flow rate of mobile phase was set to 0 9 ml min the mobile phase was composed of 60 acetonitrile and 40 deionized water employing a 50 μl syringe a 20 μl sample was injected into the device to discern the dzn concentration the flow rate was set at 1 ml min the toc analyzer shimadzu vchs csn model was used to determine the quantity of the dzn mineralization post sonophotocatalysis from the standard method tests the five day biochemical oxygen demand bod5 chemical oxygen demand cod sulfate so4 2 phosphate po4 3 nitrate no3 and ammonia nh4 were identified in accordance with standard methods for water and wastewater testing 26 eqs 1 and 2 respectively were used to calculate the degradation

reaction the capacity of the g cofe2o4 to degrade the dzn in the treatment system proposed was investigated under different conditions such as the g cofe2o4 dosage dzn concentration ph uv light intensity ultrasonic wave frequency sonophotocatalytic time and temperature after determining the optimal conditions evaluation was done of the effects of photolysis adsorption sonolysis sonocatalysis photocatalysis and sonophotocatalysis on the dzn removal for eight consecutive reaction cycles the recyclability tests for the catalyst were examined in this experiment the optimum values of the operational parameters determined from previous experiments were considered once each run was performed the catalyst was gently collected from the solution via filtration through a 0 22 μm filter paper to ensure complete removal of impurities and attached dnz molecules the collected catalyst was then washed using distilled water ethanol 50 50 v v to ensure removal of impurities finally it was oven dried at 60 c for 2 h and then utilized in the next reaction cycle of dnz degradation employing the ipa edta and bq scavengers trapping experiments were conducted to identify the reactive species during the dzn degradation via sonophotocatalysis the treated solution was evaluated for toxicity using a microbial culture of e coli several lactose broth tubes were sterilized using an autoclave and the e coli was placed in the emb agar medium for incubation at 37 c for 24 h the toxicity was determined using a few tubes for the toxicity test 10 ml of culture medium 1 ml reactor outlet one loop of microbe and a few for the control test 10 ml of culture medium one loop of microbe post the incubation at 37 c the uptake in each of the tubes was assessed by uv vis spectrophotometry at 600 nm 2 4 experimental design in the current study a combination of the rsm with ccd was employed to determine the influence exerted by the independent variables and the interactions among them upon the dependent variable degradation efficiency of dzn this study selected five factors at three levels as listed in table 2 with the alpha of face centered to investigate the effect of the factors of ph reaction time initial concentration of dzn solution temperature and the g cofe2o4 dose on the sonophotocatalytic degradation finally 50 experiments were conducted randomly applying the ccd method with eight replications at the center point the experimental findings were fitted with a second order quadratic polynomial equation as evident in eq 3 3 y β 0 i 1 k β i x i i 1 k β ii x i 2 i 1 k 1 j 2 k β

parameters respectively xi and xj denote the encoded independent variables k indicates the number of parameters and ei is an error 2 5 characterization analyses the particle distribution and surface morphology of the go and g cofe2o4 were studied using transmission electron microscopy tem cm120 model netherlands and field emission scanning electron microscopy together with energy dispersive spectroscopy fesem eds mira iii model tescan czech the x ray diffraction instrument xrd pw1730 model philips provided with a cu kα radiation source in the 2theta 10 80 range was used to examine the crystal structure of the nanocomposite with the help of the particle size analyzer and the zeta potential the zeta potential of the g cofe2o4 was determined employing the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms via the brunauer emmett teller bet method the pore size and specific surface area of the nanocomposite prepared were ascertained the vibrating sample magnetometer vsm lbkfb model kashan iran was used to analyze the magnetic characteristics of the sample the jobin yvon labram at an excitation wavelength of 785 nm facilitated the measurement of the raman spectra the thermo scientific k alpha x ray photoelectron spectrometer xps germany device was used to conduct the xps analysis relevant to the elements that exist within synthesized catalyst the structural characterizations were determined using a high resolution transmission electron microscopy hrtem tecnaig2f30 japan in addition functional groups were investigated by a fourier transform infrared spectroscopy perkin elmer 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of g cofe2o4 in fig 2 the sem images of go and g cofe2o4 are shown as is evident the go is created as a sheet in the absence of any crystalline particle phase the cofe2o4 nanoparticles are observed to have even distribution on the graphene sheet surface as well as between its layers the cofe2o4 particles are observed to be accumulated tightly perhaps linked to the strong interaction present between the magnetic particles in the cofe2o4 on edx analysis the elemental components of the nanocomposite can be confirmed revealing undoubtedly that c o co and fe are the components of the g cofe2o4 nanocomposite besides the map analysis confirms the findings cited above as well as reveals that the high concentrations of the elements which govern the photocatalysis are coated on the graphene surface in fig 3 the tem images of the samples are depicted the cofe2o4 nanoparticles displayed irregular growth with particle size between 10 and 40 nm precipitated cumulatively on the graphene nanosheets in fig 4a the xrd pattern of the g cofe2o4 nanocomposite is depicted this figure indicates the diffraction peaks for the sample observed at 2theta 18 31 30 3 35 53 43 38 53 50 57 05 and 62 66 which correspond to the 111 220 311 400 422 333 and 440 planes 27 28 apart from these peaks a weak diffraction peak is evident at 2theta 10 28 which based on the earlier studies may have a connection with the graphite 29 the weakening of the graphene peak may be attributed to the damage done to its structural layer during the crystalline growth of the cofe2o4 nanoparticles using the debye scherrer formula eq 4 30 the average crystallite size of the g cofe2o4 nanocomposite particles was 32 7 nm 4 average crystallite size 0 98 λ β cos θ where β radians is the half maximal peak width located at any 2θ radians in the xrd pattern and λ nm is the wavelength of the x ray emitted from the xrd instrument in fig 4b a diagrammatic representation of the distribution of the nanocomposite zeta potential is given the maximum potential is observed in the plot at 38 4 mv indicating that the g cofe2o4 nanoparticle surfaces carry a positive charge besides the results of the zeta potential reiterate the high physical stability displayed by the synthesized nanoparticles in the reactor prior studies cite that highly negative or positive values of the zeta potential are indicative of strong physical stability of the nanoparticles induced by the electrostatic repulsion of the individual particles 14 however the low values of the zeta potential imply the capacity of the particles to accumulate because of the predominance of van der waals adsorption force 28 raman spectroscopy is one of the useful techniques for detecting disordered properties in sp2 of carbon materials in fig 4c the raman spectra of the samples highlight the presence of band d in the 1358 1363 cm 1 range and band g in the 1595 1600 cm 1 range in light of this fact the g band as the carbon sp2 form gives information regarding the vibration sp2 of the carbon atoms that have been bonded during the carbon crystallization on the other hand band d is stated to be a disordered band the intensity rates of the d and g bands id ig are utilized as a means to describe the level of defects present in the nanomaterials 14 as is evident from fig 4c the id ig ratio rises for the graphene from 0 93 to 0 95 for the g cofe2o4 suggesting the presence of the cofe2o4 nanoparticles in high concentration on the graphene sheet in the raman spectra of graphene there are two dominant peaks 1250 1450 cm 1 and 1500 1605 cm 1 which refer to the d and g bands of graphene respectively changes in the intensity ratio of these bonds in composites indicate the loading of cofe2o4 nanoparticles on the supporting material graphene or any other carbon material which in the present study were well observed in addition the presence of additional bands in the range of 100 to 1000 cm 1 indicates the structure of spinal ferrite which was observed in the present study with different intensities kumar et al 31 reported an increase in d g bond intensity in the cobalt ferrite composite 0 97 compared to go 0 86 the authors described the event based on the electronic interaction between graphene and cofe2o4 which leads to the re establishment of the sp2 network of the supporting material after the loading of ferrite nanoparticles in addition to these observations previous studies reported that the presence of a frequency between 100 and 1000 cm 1 indicates the presence of spinal nanoparticles 32 33 this frequency range was well present in raman analysis of the present study which emphasizes the proper loading of cofe2o4 on graphene in fig 4d the magnetic properties of the g cofe2o4 nanoparticles are shown on investigation employing vsm and loop hysteresis the ms value of g cofe2o4 is observed to be 3 6 emu g showing that the g cofe2o4 nanocomposite could be isolated from the liquid medium with ease in fig 4e and f the property of the n2 adsorption desorption isotherm of the g cofe2o4 is observed from the sample curve the type iv isotherm hysteresis loop is very clear as well as the character of the prepared photocatalytic mesopores in fig 4f the pore size of the sample reveals the nanosized distribution in g cofe2o4 this pore distribution reiterates that the synthesized nanocomposites have the ability to induce a sonophotocatalytic reaction during the dzn degradation process examination of hrtem image fig 5a and crystal structure of cofe2o4 loaded onto go showed that d spacing was about 0 29 nm which was attributed to the lattice spacing 220 planes of the cofe2o4 furthermore this image demonstrated that the cofe2o4 go nanocomposite were polycrystalline phase the bandgap energy eg value of cofe2o4 nanoparticles g cofe2o4 nanocomposites and can be calculated using eq 5 13 5 α hv 2 b hv eg where α is the optical absorption coefficient 1 cm hv is the photon energy ev eg is the bandgap value ev and b is a constant 1 ev cm2 according to eq 5 the bandgap values of cofe2o4 and cofe2o4 can be determined from the plot of α hv 2 and hν fig 5b the linear variation of absorption coefficient of the g cofe2o4 and cofe2o4 at high frequencies indicates that these materials have indirect transitions across the energy band gap from fig 5b the band gap values of cofe2o4 and g cofe2o4 samples were found to be 3 2 and 1 49 ev respectively in fact this reduction in the bandgap value can be attributed to the presence of carbon species in the go structure which has significantly reduced the cofe2o4 bandgap value it can be concluded from this result that the g cofe2o4 have higher activity in the photocatalytic reaction compared to cofe2o4 the xps wide survey curves fig 5c clearly demonstrated the existence of co fe o c in cofe2o4 go composite the high resolution spectrum of the c 1 s regions for the identification of surface functionalities are fitted by seven component peaks as shown in fig 5c which are assigned to sp2 carbons c c 284 8 ev sp3 carbons 285 5 ev hydroxyl groups c oh 286 0 ev epoxy and ether groups co 286 6 ev carbonyl groups c o 287 6 ev carboxyl groups o c o 288 7 ev and p p shake up transitions 289 9 ev from the co 2p spectrum it was found that the two peaks with binding energies of about 780 5 ev corresponding to co 2p3 2 whereas the binding energy peaks around 796 4 ev were attributed to co 2p1 2 and its shake up satellites also two peaks of an fe 2p level with binding energies of 711 4 and 724 5 ev were assigned to fe 2p3 2 and fe 2p1 2 respectively all the above mentioned analyses further confirmed the presence of cofe2o4 on the surface of go the ftir spectra of go cofe2o4 and g cofe2o4 nanocomposite are depicted in fig 5d go exhibits the characteristic peak at 3398 1 cm corresponding to the o h stretching whereas the peaks appearing at 1709 1614 1389 1241 and 1061 1 cm are related to the stretching vibration c o aromatic carbon vibration c c bending in carboxylic and carbonyl o h groups vibration of epoxy groups c o and stretching vibration of alkoxy groups c o respectively the peaks detected at 468 and 554 1 cm in the cofe2o4 spectrum are assigned to the intrinsic stretching vibrations of the metal at the tetrahedral site and octahedral metal stretching respectively all the peaks detected in the ftir spectra of the go and cofe2o4 are also clearly presented in g cofe2o4 ftir spectrum and this finding is in accordance with the xrd and xps results 3 2 rsm 3 2 1 statistical analyses from the design of the laboratory matrix and the responses achieved from the 50 test runs a second order polynomial equation was acquired as an explanation for the relationship existing between the independent variables and the response mentioned below eq 6 it is noteworthy that the positive sign in this equation is indicative of the improvement in the degradation efficiency corresponding to the increase in the independent variable similar to the situation where the efficiency of the dzn degradation reduces when the parameter sign is negative 6 efficiency 49 38 9 50 a 2 16 b 1 26 c 6 58 d 1 28 e 2 90 ae 3 67 bc 3 34 8bd 10 73 a 2 7 12 b 2 the adequacy of the model was evaluated using the anova and the results are listed in table 3 from the anova of the quadratic model the f and p values were found to be 19 81 and 0 0001 respectively implying that the model is very significant the lack of fit f value of 1 21 indicates that it is not significant relative to the pure error a 42 84 chance exists that this large lack of fit f value may have been caused by noise the good predictability of the model is confirmed by the insignificant lack of fit the adequacy of the determination coefficient r2 0 835 suggests that the model utilized fits the data well the r2 value of the model indicates that 83 5 of the changes in the efficiency of the dzn degradation can be explained by the rsm model as well as that 16 5 of the changes cannot be accounted for by this model the significance of the model is also confirmed by the value of the adjusted and predicted determination coefficients apart from this the difference of less than 0 2 of the predicted r2 and the adjusted r2 lend support to the fact that the model can be used to describe the relationship among the variables and the degradation efficiency of the dzn adequate precision of 20 58 was achieved for the dzn degradation in the g cofe2o4 uv us process which because it is higher than 4 is indicative of a good sign for the quadratic model and its application in the design space in table 3 it is evident that the linear effects of the operational parameters and the interactions among them reflect that all the principal parameters are significant barring the initial concentration of dzn and photocatalyst dosage the initial ph exerts the strongest influence on the sonophotocatalytic process of dzn degradation correspondingly the dzn concentration having 1 69 as the f value exerts the least influence on the g cofe2o4 uv us system efficiency in fig 6a and b these results can be confirmed in fig 6b the slope of the plots reveals the import that the independent variable has on the process of sonophotocatalysis from this figure the steep slope of the curve and its longer measurement reiterate the great significance this parameter has on the decomposition efficiency the results in table 3 also emphasize the fact that the interactions among the parameters of the dzn degradation exert less effect than do the main factors and from among them the interactions of ae bc and bd alone have significance in fig 6c the results of anova are confirmed to be related to the interactions among the factors the crossing of the lines evident in this figure suggest the interactions among the variables correspondingly the parallel lines rule out any interaction between the two parameters therefore from the data in fig 6c and the results of the anova it can be deduced that at the upper as well as the lower limits of the photocatalyst dose e the removal efficiency is reduced first showing a steep slope and then a gradual increase this causes the maximum efficiency to occur even at low doses of the photocatalyst and also when the dosage of the catalyst is high as at an acidic ph with respect to the bc interaction it is evident that as the contact time increases the efficiency of the dzn degradation at low and high concentrations first shows a rise and then a decline these results also indicate that for low dzn concentrations high speed photodegradation efficiency takes place with a rise in radiation time in fig 6c the results also reveal that in the high and low temperature ranges improvement in the degradation efficiency is obvious with an increase in the reaction time this emphasizes the fact that for effective dzn degradation high temperature and long radiation time are mandatory finally these results help to confirm that maximum removal efficiency in the g cofe2o4 uv us system can take place under conditions of acidic ph reaction time and high temperature when compared with the other parameters the initial quadratic effect coefficients of ph x1 x1 and time x2 x2 are observed to be significant natural distribution ranks among the foremost of the essential hypotheses for the statistical analysis of the experimental data and adequacy of the model and these results are shown in fig 7 from the earlier studies 34 it is understood that when the residues follow a straight line they will have normal distribution in the present study the laboratory data are observed to be in a straight line fig 7a in fig 7b the studentized residuals versus the predicted ones reveal the residual values in a range near the x axis which is representative of no fixed error in the model in fig 7c the residual versus run diagram reveals the negative and positive run sequence which show the accurate distribution of the residues and model adequacy in fig 7d the predicted versus actual graphs are clearly seen for the efficiency of dzn degradation this figure thus shows good agreement between the actual and predicted values also the values hover sort of near the distributed straight line from these results the suitability of the quadratic model is evident enabling the prediction of the percentage of dzn degradation by the g cofe2o4 uv us system under the present parameters of operation 3 2 2 effect of operational parameters in this work based on the quadratic model the three dimensional plot revealing the manner in which the various operational parameters interaction among themselves was done as is depicted in fig 8 in fig 8a the influence exerted by the initial ph on the dzn degradation through sonophotocatalysis is shown under the specified operating conditions namely 15 w radiation intensity 65 min time 55 mg l concentration of dzn and 30 c temperature the degradation efficiency was enhanced when the initial ph dropped down from 11 to 3 thus at ph 3 7 and 11 the dzn degradation efficiencies were respectively 64 5 48 and 50 the maximum dzn degradation efficiency observed at an acidic ph than under neutral and alkaline conditions implies that the acidic state favors the sonophotocatalytic this process aided by the g cofe2o4 as the photocatalyst this occurrence can be explained as cited here earlier studies stated the zero charge point of g cofe2o4 to be 6 5 indicating that the surface of the nanocomposite carries a positive charge when the ph of the solution exceeds that of the phpzc 55 56 besides the pka of the dzn molecule was 2 6 35 suggesting that negatively charged functional groups are present on the dzn structure when the ph of the solution is higher than that of the pka based on this data the optimal situation can be in the range between pka dzn ph phpzc g cofe2o4 in the present work the acidic state of the reaction solution created the positive charge on the photocatalyst surface which thus induced the negative dzn molecules to get adsorbed by the electrostatic force on g cofe2o4 and raised the sonophotocatalytic efficiency from another side at ph values 6 5 both g cofe2o4 surface and dnz molecule have negative charges therefore the repulsion force will lead to decrease the reaction rate between the used catalyst and target pollutant and thus decreases the degradation efficiency in fact emadian et al reported similar results for the photocatalytic reduction of chromium using cofe2o4 zro2 36 further bagherzadeh et al recorded similar findings for the photocatalytic activity of mil 53 fe cofe2o4 indicating the instability of the fe2 ions at ph exceeding 4 which were then transferred to the fe3 ions these ferric ions at high ph formed chemical complexes in their reaction with the oh 37 from fig 8a the effect due to the dose of the photocatalyst on the efficiency of dzn degradation is evident as is shown the dzn degradation revealed no significant change at the different doses of the g cofe2o4 the anova was used to confirm these findings p value 0194 the synergistic effect between the cofe2o4 and graphene could be connected these results during this interaction the unique π π stacking electronic structure of the graphene resulted in high electron transfer to create the formation of the more reactive species 38 39 the cofe2o4 nanoparticles possessing exceptional adsorption ability and easy ability for electron transfer to the supporting material could restrict the recombination of electrons in the photocatalytic reactor 40 apart from boosting the mass transfer to the liquid solid interface the ultrasound induced acoustic cavitation extended the available surface area as well as ensured the uniform dispersion of the catalyst to facilitate the absorption of the pollutants and photons in fact mahdikhah et al made similar observations for the photocatalytic decomposition of organic dyes utilizing the rgo cofe2o4 nanocomposite in the current work the difference in the efficiency between the 0 2 and 1 g l doses of the photocatalyst was around 7 10 in fig 8b and c the effects and results of the reaction time on the dzn degradation using the g cofe2o4 uv us are shown as anticipated there was a rise in the removal efficiency in response to an increase in the time from 10 to 75 min this could have been caused by the greater release of the reactive radical species for pollutant degradation this result was also determined by jonidi jafari et al who presented similar results for dzn degradation using the zno tio2 uv system 41 the efficiency was seen to show a significant drop when the reaction time was raised to 120 min this could be attributed perhaps to the problem of the reactions between the short chain aliphatic and free radicals and the short life of the photocatalyst induced by the active sites being deactivated by the by products getting deposited one the most significant parameters in the aqueous matrices is the quantity of organic contaminants present in the solutions because of the influence it exerts on the reactive species which in turn causes the escalation in treatment costs in fig 8b are displayed the effects that the different concentrations of dzn have on the g cofe2o4 uv us system the dzn concentration does not significantly affect the sonophotocatalytic reactor p value 0 20 similar to the effect exerted by the initial values of the photocatalyst from these results it can be confirmed that the system employed in this study possesses high potential for the treatment of different dzn concentrations this could be attributed to the production of radicals in quantities appropriate for the different quantities of pollutants besides the heightened sonophotocatalytic efficiency may be linked to the significant synergistic effect between the cofe2o4 and graphene sheet which causes the rapid separation of the photo generated carrier in the photocatalytic system 9 besides the ultrasound can aid in the photocatalytic process in the degradation of the principal pollutant and its products from the active sites on the photocatalyst in fig 8c the effect of temperature on the sonophotocatalytic system under investigation in dzn degradation is revealed as evident the rate of degradation rises as the temperature goes up from 10 to 50 c this increased efficiency may result from the production of a more reactive species via the release of bubbles besides the raised temperature in the sonophotocatalytic reactor enables a reduction in the recombination of e h by boosting the contaminant adsorption through the rapid movement and collision of the molecules 42 in fact li et al observed a similar trend for the influence exerted by temperature for the catalytic activation of pbtio3 on methyl orange degradation 43 after all the parameters were checked using the rsm model and the numerical optimization section of the design expert software was employed to confirm the adequacy of the quadratic equation the prediction results of this model revealed that when the ph was 3 the maximum dzn degradation efficiency 84 57 could occur in a time period of 100 min at a dzn concentration of 10 mg l temperature of 50 c and g cofe2o4 in a dose of 0 99 g l five tests were done using rise in the optimum predicted condition to confirm the data accuracy and reliability the laboratory results showed a mean removal efficiency of 82 25 which was in good agreement with the predicted results this finding establishes the validity of the model for the dzn degradation by the g cofe2o4 uv us system through photocatalysis 3 2 3 effect of uv intensity and us frequency during the photo oxidation processes the lack of light triggers low efficiency catalysis indicating the necessity of light radiation for photocatalytic degradation in fig 9a the effect of uv light intensity on dzn degradation under optimal conditions is shown as achieved from the rsm model based on this figure it is obvious that when the radiation intensity is increased from 8 to 36 w there is a corresponding significant rise in efficiency from 79 39 to 100 within 60 min of radiation time the kinetic constant rate apart from confirming the findings of the degradation efficiency rises from 0 026 to 0 057 min 1 when the light intensity is increased from 8 to 36 w this observation could be connected to the high rate of the e h pair formation at the surface of the g cofe2o4 in response to the increase in the light intensity to enhance the sonophotocatalytic degradation these results concurred with the findings of nasirian et al for the influence exerted by light intensity on the degradation of the dye using fe3o4 tio2 uv 44 from fig 9b the effects of the 20 35 and 50 khz frequencies on the rate of dzn degradation using the g cofe2o4 uv us system are evident as can be seen from the figure the increase in frequencies induced a corresponding and significant rise in the degradation efficiency from 87 92 to 100 within 60 min of radiation time in like manner the kinetic rate escalates from 0 033 to 0 056 min 1 in response to the increase in the us frequency from 20 to 50 khz as shown in fig 9b this increased efficiency may be linked to the influence exerted by the increase in temperature and pressure within the reactor as preparation for the excitation energy of the photocatalyst for the yield of the e h pairs besides on raising the frequency the rate of electron transfer rises as does the cavitation process which in turn induces an acceleration in the mineralization of pollutants by the formation of the reactive active species these results concur well with the report of nejumal et al for the degradation of stable pollutants in their work they state that the high frequency is responsible for the increased efficiency and is dependent on the number and size of the bubbles produced as well as the on the availability of the radical species in the reaction medium 45 it was lim et al who examined the effect of frequency on the sonochemical degradation of chlorinated compounds and reported that an increase in the frequency from 35 to 300 khz induced a rise in the degradation efficiency caused by the high quantities of the reactive oxygen species produced 46 3 3 dzn removal by various treatment systems before proposing the present process as a technique for contaminated water treatment the parts played by all the processes employed in the sonophotocatalytic process need to be understood hence an investigation was done on the action of the g cofe2o4 catalysts uv light ultrasound and their combined performance in dzn removal under the conditions listed namely ph of 3 frequency of 35 khz intensity of 36 w dzn concentration of 50 mg l and catalyst dose of 0 5 g l from the results shown in fig 9c 42 39 removal efficiency was noted during adsorption this high efficiency may be caused largely by the phpzc of the catalyst and pka of dzn from these instances under conditions of acidic ph strong adsorption can take place between the contaminant molecules and catalyst functional groups only during the photolytic and sonolytics processes the removal efficiencies registered 30 52 and 54 06 respectively however the addition of a catalyst to the oxidation processes cited above at 30 min of reaction time induced a significant rise in the efficiency to 78 59 with g cofe2o4 uv and to 95 17 with the g cofe2o4 uv us this increased efficiency in the photocatalysis may be linked to the reactive species being produced namely oh o2 and h by the energy photons getting adsorbed on the active sites of the catalyst in the sonocatalytic reactor the ultrasound stops the active catalyst sites from blocking as well as the nanoparticle accumulation in comparison to the processes mentioned above the sonophotocatalytic process enables the full degradation of dzn in 30 min of reaction time this enhanced efficiency is caused by the combined effect of the direct means of oh production with its indirect means reaction of h with h2o oh as electron donor the ultrasound lowers the recombination rate of e h and enhances the mass transfer from the solution to the g cofe2o4 surface besides the ultrasound waves cause the nanoparticles to scatter under turbulence facilitating greater penetration of the uv light earlier studies too reported similar results for the higher sonophotocatalytic action more than the adsorption and oxidation systems alone 47 48 furthermore the removal efficiency of dzn using g cofe2o4 has been compared with the removal efficiencies given from different treatment processes using go and cofe2o4 particles fig 10 this experiment was performed at the optimized conditions obtained from previous experiments it can be seen that the dnz removal in case of g cofe2o4 was higher than go or cofe2o4 therefore g cofe2o4 is more effective than go or cofe2o4 in terms of dnz removal in the paper conducted by asghari et al a maximum dnz removal efficiency of 82 was achieved using nano mgo cnt gr as a catalyst in ozonation process which is less than the removal efficiency reached by the suggested process of this study asghari et al 49 as a confirmation of the findings given above the rate of the dzn degradation through the methods cited above was kinetically assessed as evident from fig 9c the maximum k for the dzn removal was achieved using the g cofe2o4 sonophotocatalyst k 0 115 min 1 this implies the crucial role played by all the techniques involved in the production of the active catalyst sites direct formation of the reactive species and reduction in the e h rate of recombination on the other hand for the g cofe2o4 processes of sonolysis photolysis photocatalysis and sonocatalysis the k values were 0 017 0 024 0 011 0 098 and 0 047 min 1 respectively 3 4 radical trapping experiments in order to study the mechanism of dzn degradation in the g cofe2o4 uv us system a few trapping experiments were done in the present study using a variety of scavengers like the ipa edta and bq to capture the hydroxyl oh holes h and superoxides o2 respectively from fig 9d it is evident that the dzn degradation efficiency dropped from 100 to 85 then to 71 and finally 65 when bq edta and ipa were added confirming the involvement of all the radical species in the dzn degradation however the principal oxidative species in the g cofe2o4 uv us system were identified as the oh and h it could be seen also that the effect of the edta scavenger was relatively lower than that of the ipa implying the utilization of the h for the oh production through the h2o molecules and oh ions on the basis of the results cited above and those of earlier studies 50 a potential degradation mechanism has been proposed as seen in fig 11 this figure suggests the adsorption of some dzn molecules onto the photocatalyst surface under uv light charge separation takes place and electrons e as well as the holes h are produced in the cofe2o4 particles eq 7 as the graphene is a good electron acceptor the electrons are rapidly transferred onto the graphene sheet eq 8 this negative charge on the graphene then induces the conversion of the dissolved oxygen to o2 eq 9 the h at the same time decompose the oh ions and water molecules to produce the oh eq 10 51 the ultrasonic radiation within the sonophotocatalytic reactor enables the decomposition of the water molecules to release h2o2 and oh eq 11 on the other hand the catalyst coupled ultrasonics provide the energy needed to boost the production of the e h pairs eq 12 in the course of these steps the uv light present can decompose the h2o2 to produce the oh finally the active species h o2 and h enable oxidation of the dzn molecules adsorbed on the g cofe2o4 active sites eq 13 7 co fe 2 o 4 hv co fe 2 o 4 e h 8 co fe 2 o 4 e graphene co fe 2 o 4 graphene e 9 graphene e o 2 o 2 grapheme 10 co fe 2 o 4 h h 2 o oh oh co fe 2 o 4 11 ultrasound h 2 o oh h 12 g co fe 2 o 4 ultrasound g co fe 2 o 4 e h 13 oh h o 2 dzn co 2 h 2 o degradable byproducts 3 5 g cofe2o4 reusability the g cofe2o4 photocatalyst was investigated for its recyclability as well as to assess its stability during the practical applications of the treatment of wastewater and the water matrix the nanoparticles synthesized were used in eight consecutive reaction cycles under identical conditions namely ph 3 dzn concentration 50 mg l radiation intensity 36 w and us frequency 50 khz with careful monitoring of the percentage of degradation as revealed in fig 12a a drop of around 10 in the efficiency of dzn degradation was observed by the completion of the eighth run indicative that the synthesized photocatalyst possessed both recyclability and good stability a reduction in the sonophotocatalyst activity in the long reaction cycle may be attributed to the decreased activity in the center triggered by the presence of contaminants and loss of the photocatalyst in the recycling process 3 6 mineralization and toxicity assessment the treatment of polluted water includes many goals the primary one being to fully degrade the pollutants and convert them into safe and biodegradable products in the present work the investigation of the treated solution containing dzn in terms of mineralization and toxicity was accomplished by doing a series of experimental runs from the results given in fig 12b it is clear that the increase in time from 10 to 60 min induced improvement in the efficiency of the cod and toc removal which soared to 96 41 and 90 95 respectively the concentrations of cod and toc dropped from 312 2 and 54 39 mg l to 11 2 and 4 92 mg l respectively at 60 min reaction time these findings indicate that to achieve the removal efficiency of dzn only a relatively short operating time was required in fig 12b the bod5 cod ratio offers clear explanation of the biodegradability of the treated solution the initial bod5 and cod concentrations for 100 mg l dzn were respectively 49 73 and 312 2 mg l from fig 12b it is evident that the bod5 cod ratio showed a change from 0 159 to 0 588 when the time was increased from zero to sixty minutes these data enable the confirmation of the reduced toxicity of the reaction solution and its increased biodegradability post the treatment of dzn while employing the g cofe2o4 uv us system in order to investigate the mineralization in the reaction solution more clearly with respect to the ions released during the degradation of dzn an examination of the sulfate so4 2 ammonia nh4 phosphate po4 3 and nitrate no3 ions was done post the sonophotocatalytic reaction as is evident from fig 12c during the reaction time of below 30 min the nh4 produced alone showed an increase in quantity from zero to 1 25 mg l when the reaction time was further raised to 120 min the quantities of the mineral ions of nh4 so4 2 po4 2 and no3 were respectively 9 45 3 29 2 46 and 1 53 mg l regarding the nitrogen compounds these results showed that a large portion of the nitrogen most probably combined with the intermediates or lost products like the nitrogen gases regarding the phosphorus and sulfate compounds the results indicated that a majority of the sulfate and phosphate groups in the dzn structure were retained in the byproduct during the early phases of oxidation and then slowly converted into so4 2 and po4 2 ions in fact fu et al reported similar results for the photocatalytic mineralization of methylene blue by the g cofe2o4 they reported no3 formation as proof of the genuine oxidation process 52 in addition it can be seen from fig 12c that there is a rapid increase in the nh4 concentration in contrast no3 increase at a slow rate during the sonophotocatalytic process this is due to that at the beginning of the degradation process the ammonification process occurs in the absence of low oxygen afterwards the generated ammonium will be converted to nitrate by consuming oxygen according to the nitrification process during the degradation of organic pollutants and based on their structure containing nitrogen sulfur and phosphorus etc compounds containing ions intermediate products are first produced which is low at the first time of toc removal process however with increasing reaction time the removal efficiency of toc increases indicating mineralization of organic pollutant to co2 and h2o at the same time the concentration of mineral ions produced in the solution increases due to the breaking of the structure of the intermediate products based on these results the increase in toc removal efficiency and the production of mineral ions during high reaction time are directly related the reduction in the concentration of toc in the aqueous solution during the degradation of dzn along with the production of mineral ions confirms the proper progress of mineralization of dzn as a stable contaminant hammami et al 53 and gholami et al 47 observed an increase in the production of mineral ions during the increase in the removal of toc from reactors containing emerging contaminants through oxidation processes from another side previous studies showed that complete mineralization of an organic compound containing heteroatoms is associated with the formation of co2 and mineral ions 54 in the present study the release of mineral ions is a marker of dzn mineralization the results given from fig 12b and c are indicative of the fact that dnz molecules and its intermediate compounds that generated during the sonophotocatalytic degradation process are finally converted to carbon dioxide and water based on this it can be concluded that sonophotocatalytic process acts as a suitable mineralization process and thus it can be effectively used for the removal of dnz and the generated byproducts from aqueous solution in order to evaluate the biotoxicity of the dzn solution using photolysis photocatalysis and the sonophotocatalytic systems several experiments were conducted to accomplish this the degree of e coli inhibition was estimated in the reaction reactor in which the operating conditions were maintained at ph 7 uv intensity 36 w dzn concentration 50 mg l and us frequency 50 khz in fig 12d the inhibition percentage of the treated solution is shown at different times as evident when the treatment time was raised from zero to 180 min the inhibition rate declined from 47 76 to 30 21 during the photolytic process this rather slight drop in the photolysis could be attributed to more toxic products being formed on the contrary the photocatalytic process lowered the inhibition growth rate of e coli from 47 76 to 15 53 in 180 min of reaction time this outcome is proof that photocatalysis can facilitate the production of a solution low in toxicity in the case of the sonophotocatalytic system the inhibition rate was observed to gradually decrease indicated by a very gentle slope for up to 30 min most likely because of the creation of more toxic products and low levels of mineralization these results connected to the assessment of the production rate of the mineral ions give proof for these findings and barring the nh4 their concentration was zero when the treatment time was increased from 30 to 180 min the inhibition rate showed a significant reduction from 42 73 to 9 65 these results besides confirming the intensity of mineralization elimination of the toc and residual concentration of the mineral ions revealed the effective conversion of the dzn to co2 h2o and reduction in the toxicity using the g cofe2o4 uv us system 4 conclusion to accomplish the dzn degradation the g cofe2o4 nanocomposite was added as a sonophotocatalyst from the diagnostic analyses fesem tem xrd hrtem ftir xps and vsm it was evident that the magnetic nanoparticles below 50 nm in size were loaded onto the graphene as catalysts the suitable values of r2 adjusted r2 and predicted r2 were indicative of the ability of the second order polynomial model to be used as an explanation for all the data the initial ph of all the operational parameters was found to be the most significant in the sonophotocatalytic degradation of the g cofe2o4 when compared against sonolysis photolysis sonocatalysis and the photocatalytic systems greater efficiency of degradation 100 was observed while using the sonophotocatalytic process at 30 min of reaction time in fact even after eight consecutive reaction cycles the g cofe2o4 nanocomposite displayed high degree of stability and recyclability the introduction of the radical scavengers confirmed the formation of the active radical species in the reactor h and oh being the principal active species in the dzn degradation on monitoring the removal efficiency of cod and toc an exceptional level of mineralization was noted after 60 min the mineral ions like so4 2 no3 and po4 3 were identified which besides confirming the efficiency of the toc removal also verified that the dzn was well mineralized within a brief time period from the toxicity analysis the products released during the degradation process were found to be less toxic than the principal contaminant to summarize because of its high efficiency recyclability easy separation and low effluent toxicity the g cofe2o4 uv us system can be regarded as a promising technique to treat dzn contaminated water declaration of competing interest on behalf of all authors the corresponding author states that

13100,adopting the hydrothermal method the cobalt ferrite nanocomposite was loaded onto graphene g cofe2o4 and the material thus produced was first characterized and then employed as a sonophotocatalyst to assist in the degradation of diazinon dzn at different operational parameters further response surface methodology was used for the optimization and modeling of the operational parameters from the statistical analysis of the analysis of variance anova the quadratic model was observed to give a good fit with the experimental data barring the catalyst dose p value 0 194 and the initial concentration of dzn p value 0 20 significantly affected the efficiency of the dzn degradation complete dzn degradation was achieved under the conditions of ph 3 time 100 min dzn concentration 10 mg l temperature 50 c and the g cofe2o4 dose of 0 99 g l reduction in the dzn degradation rate was observed falling below 10 during the eight consecutive cycles giving proof of the stability and adequate recyclability of the g cofe2o4 biodegradability related to the five day biochemical oxygen demand chemical oxygen demand bod5 cod ratio increased from 0 15 to 0 58 with the corresponding 90 95 total organic carbon toc and 96 41 cod being removed the toxicity evaluated using the inhibition growth rate of escherichia coli e coli showed high ability of the suggested treatment system to lower the toxicity when compared to photocatalysis and photolysis on using the analytical methods the presence of the mineral ions such as nh4 no3 so4 2 and po4 3 appeared to act as good indicators of mineralization keywords sonophotocatalytic g cofe2o4 catalyst diazinon degradation response surface methodology toxicity 1 introduction the recent decades have witnessed a significant escalation in the number and quantity of toxins produced to prevent and control plant diseases the widespread usage of chlorine and phosphorus toxins exerts harmful effects on the ecosystem over a long term posing a risk to the microorganism life damage to the central nervous and respiratory systems in animals and the eutrophication of water 1 2 extensive use has been made of diazinon c12h21n2o3ps o diethyl o 2 isopropyl 6 methylpyrimidin 4 yl thiophosphate an organophosphate insecticide for insect control in the agricultural as well as domestic milieux 3 this is a non systemic toxin easily digestible showing stability at neutral ph and is almost completely soluble in water at 40 mg l concentration at ambient temperature the diazinon at vapor pressure of 11 97 mpa and constant henry s law 1 4 10 6 atm m3 mol reveals that the present compound does not show easy volatility in both the aqueous and terrestrial environments remaining stable for several months in the environment 4 5 besides the characteristics of stability and solubility the diazinon dzn encourages surface and groundwater contamination therefore according to the classification of the world health organization who dzn is a class ii chemical which poses relative danger for all aquatic animals mammals and humans 6 therefore recently several approaches have been considered for the effective removal of these pollutants using the entire range from conventional techniques adsorption and biodegradation to advanced methodologies electro oxidation and photocatalytic processes among these photocatalysis with titanium dioxide tio2 has garnered special focus as it is economical and environmentally friendly green easy to use and inexpensive 7 however when the tio2 photocatalyst was actually applied to treat contaminated water it was not a success because separation was difficult the gap band was low and the electrons holes e h displayed rapid recombination 8 the problems cited above were overcome by some researchers who developed the use of spin ferrite magnetic nanoparticles mfe2o 4 for their characteristic features of high stability narrow gap band separation capacity simple synthesis and strong coercivity as a semiconductor cobalt ferrite cofe2o4 is composed of co2 at the tetrahedral site and fe3 at the octahedral one 9 10 during the photocatalytic reactions the cofe2o4 metal ions absorb light and the electrons are moved from the valence band to the conduction band to form the hole h this mechanism results in an increase in the e h pair for the formation of the oxidative species oxidizing the pollutants at the photocatalyst surface 11 reports from earlier studies indicate that the cofe2o4 nanoparticles are active in photodegradation enabling the removal of the organic and resistant contaminants 12 however in recent times the low degree of segregation of the charge carrier species collection and high photocorrosion rates are the limitations observed in the practical photocatalytic application of the cofe2o4 11 graphene oxide go coupled with ferrite based photocatalysts has been suggested as a solution for these issues and enhancement of the photocatalytic features as a two dimensional carbon material of sp2 bonded carbon graphene contains a wide variety of and several functional groups including the carboxyl hydroxyl and epoxy ones besides others capable of immobilizing substantial quantities of photocatalysts with appropriate dispersion 13 15 as graphene exhibits high surface area exceptional charge separation property between the π π electrons and good conductivity the cofe2o4 and graphene combination the combined particles named here g cofe2o4 enhances the electron transfer between the composite phases as well as lowers the recombination rate of the charge carrier 10 further graphene ensures long life for the photogenerated charge carriers through the provision of channels for electron movement 16 it was devi and srinivas who were responsible for the preparation of the g cofe2o4 hetero architecture nanocomposites to degrade 4 chlorophenol 16 in their demonstration the combination of reduced graphene and cofe2o4 significantly escalated the degradation rate more than when the cofe2o4 alone was used in fact he and lu used the co precipitation method to synthesize the g cofe2o4 hybrid nanoparticles they reported that the maximum degradation efficiency of malachite green dye was higher at neutral ph than at ph 5 17 in their work gan et al employed the hydrothermal method for the g cofe2o4 nanocomposite synthesis used in the photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue dye they reported that in the degradation system this photocatalyst showed long term potential 18 several research groups have reported that the adoption of a technology that could induce a synergistic effect to activate the oxidants will significantly raise the rate of environmental remediation 3 19 over the recent years sonolysis has grabbed centerstage as a chemical reaction that results from the adoption of ultrasound radiation because of it safety of usage and absence of chemical involvement 20 during the sonophotocatalytic process a combination of ultrasound and photocatalysis the ultrasound can produce large quantities of oh via acoustic cavitation 21 besides the cavitation process the removal of the by products from the active catalyst sites as well enables the catalytic sites to get regenerated through the action of turbulence and microcurrents further prior studies have recorded that the ultrasound radiation when applied in a reaction reactor can induce improvement in the processes of adsorption electron transfer decomposition of the hydrophobic part of the organic compounds and catalyst dispersion 22 in the face of these considerations only few studies have been done on the sample toxicity drawn from the sonophotocatalytic reactor besides only few observations regarding the anion and cation concentrations resulting from the complete degradation of the micropollutants are available in the earlier studies as is true for other removal techniques the photocatalytic process at its maximum level of application shows great dependence upon the operating conditions an effective method of determining the interactions between one or more response variables and the independent variables is to design the experiments adopting the response surface methodology rsm this statistical method is employed for optimizing the output variables while building the experimental models for pollutant removal the earlier studies demonstrate the fitting and pertinent efficiency of the rsm in ascertaining the optimal conditions for micropollutant removal through photocatalysis 23 24 the operational parameters in this study namely the initial ph photocatalyst dose reaction time initial dzn concentration and temperature were optimized by rsm coupled with the central composite design ccd the synthesis of the g cofe2o4 nanocomposite was accomplished using the hydrothermal technique this was then utilized as a catalyzer during the degradation of dzn via sonophotocatalysis the e coli bacterial culture was employed to investigate toxicity of the treated solution by examining eight consecutive sonophotocatalytic degradation cycles the stability and recyclability of g cofe2o4 were confirmed and an evaluation was done of the mineral ion concentration produced by the dzn degradation 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the following chemicals were purchased from sigma aldrich

synthetic and stock solutions were prepared using deionized water 2 2 synthesis of g cofe2o4 the g cofe2o4 nanocomposite as shown in fig 1 was synthesized using the co precipitation hydrothermal method to begin with 250 mg of go was dissolved using 100 ml of water for 4 h in an ultrasonic bath next ferric nitrate 2 g and cobalt nitrate 0 75 g were added gradually to the go solution using concentrated naoh the ph value of the mixture was adjusted to 12 and mixing was performed for 2 h at 80 c later to the go mixture 8 ml of hydrazine hydrate was added slowly to reduce the go and the black mixture finally formed was stirred at 80 c for 10 h more once cooling to ambient temperature was accomplished the solids thus separated via filtration were subjected to washing with deionized water and ethanol to ensure impurity removal last the remaining solids g cofe2o4 were placed in an oven and vacuum dried for 24 h at 60 c previous studies found that the optimal graphene content in g cofe2o4 used in the degradation systems was 22 whereas this percentage was fixed in the catalyst synthesis process of this study 25 2 3 sonophotocatalytic experiments all the experiments were conducted in a pyrex vessel reactor with a quartz plate on one side uv light irradiation was performed using a mercury lamp philips netherlands in addition an ultrasound bath sunshine ss 6508 t was used for performing the ultrasound us waves during the sonophotocatalytic process the temperature value was controlled using an external water bath a certain amount of g cofe2o4 photocatalyst 0 1 1 g l was dissolved in a solution of dzn the addition of 0 1 m sodium hydroxide and sulfuric acid was done to adjust the solution ph from 3 to 11 while sonophotocatalysis was ongoing a 10 ml of sample was drawn from the reactor at the predetermined reaction time 10 120 min then the collected samples were subjected to filtration process using a 0 22 μm filter paper to ensure separation of the nanocomposites from aqueous solution the dzn concentration in the aqueous solution was identified utilizing high performance liquid chromatography hplc kenaver company germany along with the c18

and 40 deionized water employing a 50 μl syringe a 20 μl sample was injected into the device to discern the dzn concentration the flow rate was set at 1 ml min the toc analyzer shimadzu vchs csn model was used to determine the quantity of the dzn mineralization post sonophotocatalysis from the standard method tests the five day biochemical oxygen demand bod5 chemical oxygen demand cod sulfate so4 2 phosphate po4 3 nitrate no3 and ammonia nh4 were identified in accordance with standard methods for water and wastewater testing 26 eqs 1 and 2 respectively were used to calculate the degradation

intensity ultrasonic wave frequency sonophotocatalytic time and temperature after determining the optimal conditions evaluation was done of the effects of photolysis adsorption sonolysis sonocatalysis photocatalysis and sonophotocatalysis on the dzn removal for eight consecutive reaction cycles the recyclability tests for the catalyst were examined in this experiment the optimum values of the operational parameters determined from previous experiments were considered once each run was performed the catalyst was gently collected from the solution via filtration through a 0 22 μm filter paper to ensure complete removal of impurities and attached dnz molecules the collected catalyst was then washed using distilled water ethanol 50 50 v v to ensure removal of impurities finally it was oven dried at 60 c for 2 h and then utilized in the next reaction cycle of dnz degradation employing the ipa edta and bq scavengers trapping experiments were conducted to identify the reactive species during the dzn degradation via sonophotocatalysis the treated solution was evaluated for toxicity using a microbial culture of e coli several lactose broth tubes were sterilized using an autoclave and the e coli was placed in the emb agar medium for incubation at 37 c for 24 h the toxicity was determined using a few tubes for the toxicity test 10 ml of culture medium 1 ml reactor outlet one loop of microbe and a few for the control test 10 ml of culture medium one loop of microbe post the incubation at 37 c the uptake in each of the tubes was assessed by uv vis spectrophotometry at 600 nm 2 4 experimental design in the current study a combination of the rsm with ccd was employed to determine the influence exerted by the independent variables and the interactions among them upon the dependent variable degradation efficiency of dzn this study selected five factors at three levels as listed in table 2 with the alpha of face centered to investigate the effect of the factors of ph reaction time initial concentration of dzn solution temperature and the g cofe2o4 dose on the sonophotocatalytic degradation finally 50 experiments were conducted randomly applying the ccd method with eight replications at the center point the experimental findings were fitted with a second order quadratic polynomial equation as evident in eq 3 3 y β 0 i 1 k β i x i i 1 k β ii x i 2 i 1 k 1 j 2 k β

alpha x ray photoelectron spectrometer xps germany device was used to conduct the xps analysis relevant to the elements that exist within synthesized catalyst the structural characterizations were determined using a high resolution transmission electron microscopy hrtem tecnaig2f30 japan in addition functional groups were investigated by a fourier transform infrared spectroscopy perkin elmer 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of g cofe2o4 in fig 2 the sem images of go and g cofe2o4 are shown as is evident the go is created as a sheet in the absence of any crystalline particle phase the cofe2o4 nanoparticles are observed to have even distribution on the graphene sheet surface as well as between its layers the cofe2o4 particles are observed to be accumulated tightly perhaps linked to the strong interaction present between the magnetic particles in the cofe2o4 on edx analysis the elemental components of the nanocomposite can be confirmed revealing undoubtedly that c o co and fe are the components of the g cofe2o4 nanocomposite besides the map analysis confirms the findings cited above as well as reveals that the high concentrations of the elements which govern the photocatalysis are coated on the graphene surface in fig 3 the tem images of the samples are depicted the cofe2o4 nanoparticles displayed irregular growth with particle size between 10 and 40 nm precipitated cumulatively on the graphene nanosheets in fig 4a the xrd pattern of the g cofe2o4 nanocomposite is depicted this figure indicates the diffraction peaks for the sample observed at 2theta 18 31 30 3 35 53 43 38 53 50 57 05 and 62 66 which correspond to the 111 220 311 400 422 333 and 440 planes 27 28 apart from these peaks a weak diffraction peak is evident at 2theta 10 28 which based on the earlier studies may have a connection with the graphite 29 the weakening of the graphene peak may be attributed to the damage done to its structural layer during the crystalline growth of the cofe2o4 nanoparticles using the debye scherrer formula eq 4 30 the average crystallite size of the g cofe2o4 nanocomposite particles was 32 7 nm 4 average crystallite size 0 98 λ β cos θ where β radians is the half maximal peak width located at any 2θ radians in the xrd pattern and λ nm is the wavelength of the x ray emitted from the xrd instrument in fig 4b a diagrammatic representation of the distribution of the nanocomposite zeta potential is given the maximum potential is observed in the plot at 38 4 mv indicating that the g cofe2o4 nanoparticle surfaces carry a positive charge besides the results of the zeta potential reiterate the high physical stability displayed by the synthesized nanoparticles in the reactor prior studies cite that highly negative or positive values of the zeta potential are indicative of strong physical stability of the nanoparticles induced by the electrostatic repulsion of the individual particles 14 however the low values of the zeta potential imply the capacity of the particles to accumulate because of the predominance of van der waals adsorption force 28 raman spectroscopy is one of the useful techniques for detecting disordered properties in sp2 of carbon materials in fig 4c the raman spectra of the samples highlight the presence of band d in the 1358 1363 cm 1 range and band g in the 1595 1600 cm 1 range in light of this fact the g band as the carbon sp2 form gives information regarding the vibration sp2 of the carbon atoms that have been bonded during the carbon crystallization on the other hand band d is stated to be a disordered band the intensity rates of the d and g bands id ig are utilized as a means to describe the level of defects present in the nanomaterials 14 as is evident from fig 4c the id ig ratio rises for the graphene from 0 93 to 0 95 for the g cofe2o4 suggesting the presence of the cofe2o4 nanoparticles in high concentration on the graphene sheet in the raman spectra of graphene there are two dominant peaks 1250 1450 cm 1 and 1500 1605 cm 1 which refer to the d and g bands of graphene respectively changes in the intensity ratio of these bonds in composites indicate the loading of cofe2o4 nanoparticles on the supporting material graphene or any other carbon material which in the present study were well observed in addition the presence of additional bands in the range of 100 to 1000 cm 1 indicates the structure of spinal ferrite which was observed in the present study with different intensities kumar et al 31 reported an increase in d g bond intensity in the cobalt ferrite composite 0 97 compared to go 0 86 the authors described the event based on the electronic interaction between graphene and cofe2o4 which leads to the re establishment of the sp2 network of the supporting material after the loading of ferrite nanoparticles in addition to these observations previous studies reported that the presence of a frequency between 100 and 1000 cm 1 indicates the presence of spinal nanoparticles 32 33 this frequency range was well present in raman analysis of the present study which emphasizes the proper loading of cofe2o4 on graphene in fig 4d the magnetic properties of the g cofe2o4 nanoparticles are shown on investigation employing vsm and loop hysteresis the ms value of g cofe2o4 is observed to be 3 6 emu g showing that the g cofe2o4 nanocomposite could be isolated from the liquid medium with ease in fig 4e and f the property of the n2 adsorption desorption isotherm of the g cofe2o4 is observed from the sample curve the type iv isotherm hysteresis loop is very clear as well as the character of the prepared photocatalytic mesopores in fig 4f the pore size of the sample reveals the nanosized distribution in g cofe2o4 this pore distribution reiterates that the synthesized nanocomposites have the ability to induce a sonophotocatalytic reaction during the dzn degradation process examination of hrtem image fig 5a and crystal structure of cofe2o4 loaded onto go showed that d spacing was about 0 29 nm which was attributed to the lattice spacing 220 planes of the cofe2o4 furthermore this image demonstrated that the cofe2o4 go nanocomposite were polycrystalline phase the bandgap energy eg value of cofe2o4 nanoparticles g cofe2o4 nanocomposites and can be calculated using eq 5 13 5 α hv 2 b hv eg where α is the optical absorption coefficient 1 cm hv is the photon energy ev eg is the bandgap value ev and b is a constant 1 ev cm2 according to eq 5 the bandgap values of cofe2o4 and cofe2o4 can be determined from the plot of α hv 2 and hν fig 5b the linear variation of absorption coefficient of the g cofe2o4 and cofe2o4 at high frequencies indicates that these materials have indirect transitions across the energy band gap from fig 5b the band gap values of cofe2o4 and g cofe2o4 samples were found to be 3 2 and 1 49 ev respectively in fact this reduction in the bandgap value can be attributed to the presence of carbon species in the go structure which has significantly reduced the cofe2o4 bandgap value it can be concluded from this result that the g cofe2o4 have higher activity in the photocatalytic reaction compared to cofe2o4 the xps wide survey curves fig 5c clearly demonstrated the existence of co fe o c in cofe2o4 go composite the high resolution spectrum of the c 1 s regions for the identification of surface functionalities are fitted by seven component peaks as shown in fig 5c which are assigned to sp2 carbons c c 284 8 ev sp3 carbons 285 5 ev hydroxyl groups c oh 286 0 ev epoxy and ether groups co 286 6 ev carbonyl groups c o 287 6 ev carboxyl groups o c o 288 7 ev and p p shake up transitions 289 9 ev from the co 2p spectrum it was found that the two peaks with binding energies of about 780 5 ev corresponding to co 2p3 2 whereas the binding energy peaks around 796 4 ev were attributed to co 2p1 2 and its shake up satellites also two peaks of an fe 2p level with binding energies of 711 4 and 724 5 ev were assigned to fe 2p3 2 and fe 2p1 2 respectively all the above mentioned analyses further confirmed the presence of cofe2o4 on the surface of go the ftir spectra of go cofe2o4 and g cofe2o4 nanocomposite are depicted in fig 5d go exhibits the characteristic peak at 3398 1 cm corresponding to the o h stretching whereas the peaks appearing at 1709 1614 1389 1241 and 1061 1 cm are related to the stretching vibration c o aromatic carbon vibration c c bending in carboxylic and carbonyl o h groups vibration of epoxy groups c o and stretching vibration of alkoxy groups c o respectively the peaks detected at 468 and 554 1 cm in the cofe2o4 spectrum are assigned to the intrinsic stretching vibrations of the metal at the tetrahedral site and octahedral metal stretching respectively all the peaks detected in the ftir spectra of the go and cofe2o4 are also clearly presented in g cofe2o4 ftir spectrum and this finding is in accordance with the xrd and xps results 3 2 rsm 3 2 1 statistical analyses from the design of the laboratory matrix and the responses achieved from the 50 test runs a second order polynomial equation was acquired as an explanation for the relationship existing between the independent variables and the response mentioned below eq 6 it is noteworthy that the positive sign in this equation is indicative of the improvement in the degradation efficiency corresponding to the increase in the independent variable similar to the situation where the efficiency of the dzn degradation reduces when the parameter sign is negative 6 efficiency 49 38 9 50 a 2 16 b 1 26 c 6 58 d 1 28 e 2 90 ae 3 67 bc 3 34 8bd 10 73 a 2 7 12 b 2 the adequacy of the model was evaluated using the anova and the results are listed in table 3 from the anova of the quadratic model the f and p values were found to be 19 81 and 0 0001 respectively implying that the model is very significant the lack of fit f value of 1 21 indicates that it is not significant relative to the pure error a 42 84 chance exists that this large lack of fit f value may have been caused by noise the good predictability of the model is confirmed by the insignificant lack of fit the adequacy of the determination coefficient r2 0 835 suggests that the model utilized fits the data well the r2 value of the model indicates that 83 5 of the changes in the efficiency of the dzn degradation can be explained by the rsm model as well as that 16 5 of the changes cannot be accounted for by this model the significance of the model is also confirmed by the value of the adjusted and predicted determination coefficients apart from this the difference of less than 0 2 of the predicted r2 and the adjusted r2 lend support to the fact that the model can be used to describe the relationship among the variables and the degradation efficiency of the dzn adequate precision of 20 58 was achieved for the dzn degradation in the g cofe2o4 uv us process which because it is higher than 4 is indicative of a good sign for the quadratic model and its application in the design space in table 3 it is evident that the linear effects of the operational parameters and the interactions among them reflect that all the principal parameters are significant barring the initial concentration of dzn and photocatalyst dosage the initial ph exerts the strongest influence on the sonophotocatalytic process of dzn degradation correspondingly the dzn concentration having 1 69 as the f value exerts the least influence on the g cofe2o4 uv us system efficiency in fig 6a and b these results can be confirmed in fig 6b the slope of the plots reveals the import that the independent variable has on the process of sonophotocatalysis from this figure the steep slope of the curve and its longer measurement reiterate the great significance this parameter has on the decomposition efficiency the results in table 3 also emphasize the fact that the interactions among the parameters of the dzn degradation exert less effect than do the main factors and from among them the interactions of ae bc and bd alone have significance in fig 6c the results of anova are confirmed to be related to the interactions among the factors the crossing of the lines evident in this figure suggest the interactions among the variables correspondingly the parallel lines rule out any interaction between the two parameters therefore from the data in fig 6c and the results of the anova it can be deduced that at the upper as well as the lower limits of the photocatalyst dose e the removal efficiency is reduced first showing a steep slope and then a gradual increase this causes the maximum efficiency to occur even at low doses of the photocatalyst and also when the dosage of the catalyst is high as at an acidic ph with respect to the bc interaction it is evident that as the contact time increases the efficiency of the dzn degradation at low and high concentrations first shows a rise and then a decline these results also indicate that for low dzn concentrations high speed photodegradation efficiency takes place with a rise in radiation time in fig 6c the results also reveal that in the high and low temperature ranges improvement in the degradation efficiency is obvious with an increase in the reaction time this emphasizes the fact that for effective dzn degradation high temperature and long radiation time are mandatory finally these results help to confirm that maximum removal efficiency in the g cofe2o4 uv us system can take place under conditions of acidic ph reaction time and high temperature when compared with the other parameters the initial quadratic effect coefficients of ph x1 x1 and time x2 x2 are observed to be significant natural distribution ranks among the foremost of the essential hypotheses for the statistical analysis of the experimental data and adequacy of the model and these results are shown in fig 7 from the earlier studies 34 it is understood that when the residues follow a straight line they will have normal distribution in the present study the laboratory data are observed to be in a straight line fig 7a in fig 7b the studentized residuals versus the predicted ones reveal the residual values in a range near the x axis which is representative of no fixed error in the model in fig 7c the residual versus run diagram reveals the negative and positive run sequence which show the accurate distribution of the residues and model adequacy in fig 7d the predicted versus actual graphs are clearly seen for the efficiency of dzn degradation this figure thus shows good agreement between the actual and predicted values also the values hover sort of near the distributed straight line from these results the suitability of the quadratic model is evident enabling the prediction of the percentage of dzn degradation by the g cofe2o4 uv us system under the present parameters of operation 3 2 2 effect of operational parameters in this work based on the quadratic model the three dimensional plot revealing the manner in which the various operational parameters interaction among themselves was done as is depicted in fig 8 in fig 8a the influence exerted by the initial ph on the dzn degradation through sonophotocatalysis is shown under the specified operating conditions namely 15 w radiation intensity 65 min time 55 mg l concentration of dzn and 30 c temperature the degradation efficiency was enhanced when the initial ph dropped down from 11 to 3 thus at ph 3 7 and 11 the dzn degradation efficiencies were respectively 64 5 48 and 50 the maximum dzn degradation efficiency observed at an acidic ph than under neutral and alkaline conditions implies that the acidic state favors the sonophotocatalytic this process aided by the g cofe2o4 as the photocatalyst this occurrence can be explained as cited here earlier studies stated the zero charge point of g cofe2o4 to be 6 5 indicating that the surface of the nanocomposite carries a positive charge when the ph of the solution exceeds that of the phpzc 55 56 besides the pka of the dzn molecule was 2 6 35 suggesting that negatively charged functional groups are present on the dzn structure when the ph of the solution is higher than that of the pka based on this data the optimal situation can be in the range between pka dzn ph phpzc g cofe2o4 in the present work the acidic state of the reaction solution created the positive charge on the photocatalyst surface which thus induced the negative dzn molecules to get adsorbed by the electrostatic force on g cofe2o4 and raised the sonophotocatalytic efficiency from another side at ph values 6 5 both g cofe2o4 surface and dnz molecule have negative charges therefore the repulsion force will lead to decrease the reaction rate between the used catalyst and target pollutant and thus decreases the degradation efficiency in fact emadian et al reported similar results for the photocatalytic reduction of chromium using cofe2o4 zro2 36 further bagherzadeh et al recorded similar findings for the photocatalytic activity of mil 53 fe cofe2o4 indicating the instability of the fe2 ions at ph exceeding 4 which were then transferred to the fe3 ions these ferric ions at high ph formed chemical complexes in their reaction with the oh 37 from fig 8a the effect due to the dose of the photocatalyst on the efficiency of dzn degradation is evident as is shown the dzn degradation revealed no significant change at the different doses of the g cofe2o4 the anova was used to confirm these findings p value 0194 the synergistic effect between the cofe2o4 and graphene could be connected these results during this interaction the unique π π stacking electronic structure of the graphene resulted in high electron transfer to create the formation of the more reactive species 38 39 the cofe2o4 nanoparticles possessing exceptional adsorption ability and easy ability for electron transfer to the supporting material could restrict the recombination of electrons in the photocatalytic reactor 40 apart from boosting the mass transfer to the liquid solid interface the ultrasound induced acoustic cavitation extended the available surface area as well as ensured the uniform dispersion of the catalyst to facilitate the absorption of the pollutants and photons in fact mahdikhah et al made similar observations for the photocatalytic decomposition of organic dyes utilizing the rgo cofe2o4 nanocomposite in the current work the difference in the efficiency between the 0 2 and 1 g l doses of the photocatalyst was around 7 10 in fig 8b and c the effects and results of the reaction time on the dzn degradation using the g cofe2o4 uv us are shown as anticipated there was a rise in the removal efficiency in response to an increase in the time from 10 to 75 min this could have been caused by the greater release of the reactive radical species for pollutant degradation this result was also determined by jonidi jafari et al who presented similar results for dzn degradation using the zno tio2 uv system 41 the efficiency was seen to show a significant drop when the reaction time was raised to 120 min this could be attributed perhaps to the problem of the reactions between the short chain aliphatic and free radicals and the short life of the photocatalyst induced by the active sites being deactivated by the by products getting deposited one the most significant parameters in the aqueous matrices is the quantity of organic contaminants present in the solutions because of the influence it exerts on the reactive species which in turn causes the escalation in treatment costs in fig 8b are displayed the effects that the different concentrations of dzn have on the g cofe2o4 uv us system the dzn concentration does not significantly affect the sonophotocatalytic reactor p value 0 20 similar to the effect exerted by the initial values of the photocatalyst from these results it can be confirmed that the system employed in this study possesses high potential for the treatment of different dzn concentrations this could be attributed to the production of radicals in quantities appropriate for the different quantities of pollutants besides the heightened sonophotocatalytic efficiency may be linked to the significant synergistic effect between the cofe2o4 and graphene sheet which causes the rapid separation of the photo generated carrier in the photocatalytic system 9 besides the ultrasound can aid in the photocatalytic process in the degradation of the principal pollutant and its products from the active sites on the photocatalyst in fig 8c the effect of temperature on the sonophotocatalytic system under investigation in dzn degradation is revealed as evident the rate of degradation rises as the temperature goes up from 10 to 50 c this increased efficiency may result from the production of a more reactive species via the release of bubbles besides the raised temperature in the sonophotocatalytic reactor enables a reduction in the recombination of e h by boosting the contaminant adsorption through the rapid movement and collision of the molecules 42 in fact li et al observed a similar trend for the influence exerted by temperature for the catalytic activation of pbtio3 on methyl orange degradation 43 after all the parameters were checked using the rsm model and the numerical optimization section of the design expert software was employed to confirm the adequacy of the quadratic equation the prediction results of this model revealed that when the ph was 3 the maximum dzn degradation efficiency 84 57 could occur in a time period of 100 min at a dzn concentration of 10 mg l temperature of 50 c and g cofe2o4 in a dose of 0 99 g l five tests were done using rise in the optimum predicted condition to confirm the data accuracy and reliability the laboratory results showed a mean removal efficiency of 82 25 which was in good agreement with the predicted results this finding establishes the validity of the model for the dzn degradation by the g cofe2o4 uv us system through photocatalysis 3 2 3 effect of uv intensity and us frequency during the photo oxidation processes the lack of light triggers low efficiency catalysis indicating the necessity of light radiation for photocatalytic degradation in fig 9a the effect of uv light intensity on dzn degradation under optimal conditions is shown as achieved from the rsm model based on this figure it is obvious that when the radiation intensity is increased from 8 to 36 w there is a corresponding significant rise in efficiency from 79 39 to 100 within 60 min of radiation time the kinetic constant rate apart from confirming the findings of the degradation efficiency rises from 0 026 to 0 057 min 1 when the light intensity is increased from 8 to 36 w this observation could be connected to the high rate of the e h pair formation at the surface of the g cofe2o4 in response to the increase in the light intensity to enhance the sonophotocatalytic degradation these results concurred with the findings of nasirian et al for the influence exerted by light intensity on the degradation of the dye using fe3o4 tio2 uv 44 from fig 9b the effects of the 20 35 and 50 khz frequencies on the rate of dzn degradation using the g cofe2o4 uv us system are evident as can be seen from the figure the increase in frequencies induced a corresponding and significant rise in the degradation efficiency from 87 92 to 100 within 60 min of radiation time in like manner the kinetic rate escalates from 0 033 to 0 056 min 1 in response to the increase in the us frequency from 20 to 50 khz as shown in fig 9b this increased efficiency may be linked to the influence exerted by the increase in temperature and pressure within the reactor as preparation for the excitation energy of the photocatalyst for the yield of the e h pairs besides on raising the frequency the rate of electron transfer rises as does the cavitation process which in turn induces an acceleration in the mineralization of pollutants by the formation of the reactive active species these results concur well with the report of nejumal et al for the degradation of stable pollutants in their work they state that the high frequency is responsible for the increased efficiency and is dependent on the number and size of the bubbles produced as well as the on the availability of the radical species in the reaction medium 45 it was lim et al who examined the effect of frequency on the sonochemical degradation of chlorinated compounds and reported that an increase in the frequency from 35 to 300 khz induced a rise in the degradation efficiency caused by the high quantities of the reactive oxygen species produced 46 3 3 dzn removal by various treatment systems before proposing the present process as a technique for contaminated water treatment the parts played by all the processes employed in the sonophotocatalytic process need to be understood hence an investigation was done on the action of the g cofe2o4 catalysts uv light ultrasound and their combined performance in dzn removal under the conditions listed namely ph of 3 frequency of 35 khz intensity of 36 w dzn concentration of 50 mg l and catalyst dose of 0 5 g l from the results shown in fig 9c 42 39 removal efficiency was noted during adsorption this high efficiency may be caused largely by the phpzc of the catalyst and pka of dzn from these instances under conditions of acidic ph strong adsorption can take place between the contaminant molecules and catalyst functional groups only during the photolytic and sonolytics processes the removal efficiencies registered 30 52 and 54 06 respectively however the addition of a catalyst to the oxidation processes cited above at 30 min of reaction time induced a significant rise in the efficiency to 78 59 with g cofe2o4 uv and to 95 17 with the g cofe2o4 uv us this increased efficiency in the photocatalysis may be linked to the reactive species being produced namely oh o2 and h by the energy photons getting adsorbed on the active sites of the catalyst in the sonocatalytic reactor the ultrasound stops the active catalyst sites from blocking as well as the nanoparticle accumulation in comparison to the processes mentioned above the sonophotocatalytic process enables the full degradation of dzn in 30 min of reaction time this enhanced efficiency is caused by the combined effect of the direct means of oh production with its indirect means reaction of h with h2o oh as electron donor the ultrasound lowers the recombination rate of e h and enhances the mass transfer from the solution to the g cofe2o4 surface besides the ultrasound waves cause the nanoparticles to scatter under turbulence facilitating greater penetration of the uv light earlier studies too reported similar results for the higher sonophotocatalytic action more than the adsorption and oxidation systems alone 47 48 furthermore the removal efficiency of dzn using g cofe2o4 has been compared with the removal efficiencies given from different treatment processes using go and cofe2o4 particles fig 10 this experiment was performed at the optimized conditions obtained from previous experiments it can be seen that the dnz removal in case of g cofe2o4 was higher than go or cofe2o4 therefore g cofe2o4 is more effective than go or cofe2o4 in terms of dnz removal in the paper conducted by asghari et al a maximum dnz removal efficiency of 82 was achieved using nano mgo cnt gr as a catalyst in ozonation process which is less than the removal efficiency reached by the suggested process of this study asghari et al 49 as a confirmation of the findings given above the rate of the dzn degradation through the methods cited above was kinetically assessed as evident from fig 9c the maximum k for the dzn removal was achieved using the g cofe2o4 sonophotocatalyst k 0 115 min 1 this implies the crucial role played by all the techniques involved in the production of the active catalyst sites direct formation of the reactive species and reduction in the e h rate of recombination on the other hand for the g cofe2o4 processes of sonolysis photolysis photocatalysis and sonocatalysis the k values were 0 017 0 024 0 011 0 098 and 0 047 min 1 respectively 3 4 radical trapping experiments in order to study the mechanism of dzn degradation in the g cofe2o4 uv us system a few trapping experiments were done in the present study using a variety of scavengers like the ipa edta and bq to capture the hydroxyl oh holes h and superoxides o2 respectively from fig 9d it is evident that the dzn degradation efficiency dropped from 100 to 85 then to 71 and finally 65 when bq edta and ipa were added confirming the involvement of all the radical species in the dzn degradation however the principal oxidative species in the g cofe2o4 uv us system were identified as the oh and h it could be seen also that the effect of the edta scavenger was relatively lower than that of the ipa implying the utilization of the h for the oh production through the h2o molecules and oh ions on the basis of the results cited above and those of earlier studies 50 a potential degradation mechanism has been proposed as seen in fig 11 this figure suggests the adsorption of some dzn molecules onto the photocatalyst surface under uv light charge separation takes place and electrons e as well as the holes h are produced in the cofe2o4 particles eq 7 as the graphene is a good electron acceptor the electrons are rapidly transferred onto the graphene sheet eq 8 this negative charge on the graphene then induces the conversion of the dissolved oxygen to o2 eq 9 the h at the same time decompose the oh ions and water molecules to produce the oh eq 10 51 the ultrasonic radiation within the sonophotocatalytic reactor enables the decomposition of the water molecules to release h2o2 and oh eq 11 on the other hand the catalyst coupled ultrasonics provide the energy needed to boost the production of the e h pairs eq 12 in the course of these steps the uv light present can decompose the h2o2 to produce the oh finally the active species h o2 and h enable oxidation of the dzn molecules adsorbed on the g cofe2o4 active sites eq 13 7 co fe 2 o 4 hv co fe 2 o 4 e h 8 co fe 2 o 4 e graphene co fe 2 o 4 graphene e 9 graphene e o 2 o 2 grapheme 10 co fe 2 o 4 h h 2 o oh oh co fe 2 o 4 11 ultrasound h 2 o oh h 12 g co fe 2 o 4 ultrasound g co fe 2 o 4 e h 13 oh h o 2 dzn co 2 h 2 o degradable byproducts 3 5 g cofe2o4 reusability the g cofe2o4 photocatalyst was investigated for its recyclability as well as to assess its stability during the practical applications of the treatment of wastewater and the water matrix the nanoparticles synthesized were used in eight consecutive reaction cycles under identical conditions namely ph 3 dzn concentration 50 mg l radiation intensity 36 w and us frequency 50 khz with careful monitoring of the percentage of degradation as revealed in fig 12a a drop of around 10 in the efficiency of dzn degradation was observed by the completion of the eighth run indicative that the synthesized photocatalyst possessed both recyclability and good stability a reduction in the sonophotocatalyst activity in the long reaction cycle may be attributed to the decreased activity in the center triggered by the presence of contaminants and loss of the photocatalyst in the recycling process 3 6 mineralization and toxicity assessment the treatment of polluted water includes many goals the primary one being to fully degrade the pollutants and convert them into safe and biodegradable products in the present work the investigation of the treated solution containing dzn in terms of mineralization and toxicity was accomplished by doing a series of experimental runs from the results given in fig 12b it is clear that the increase in time from 10 to 60 min induced improvement in the efficiency of the cod and toc removal which soared to 96 41 and 90 95 respectively the concentrations of cod and toc dropped from 312 2 and 54 39 mg l to 11 2 and 4 92 mg l respectively at 60 min reaction time these findings indicate that to achieve the removal efficiency of dzn only a relatively short operating time was required in fig 12b the bod5 cod ratio offers clear explanation of the biodegradability of the treated solution the initial bod5 and cod concentrations for 100 mg l dzn were respectively 49 73 and 312 2 mg l from fig 12b it is evident that the bod5 cod ratio showed a change from 0 159 to 0 588 when the time was increased from zero to sixty minutes these data enable the confirmation of the reduced toxicity of the reaction solution and its increased biodegradability post the treatment of dzn while employing the g cofe2o4 uv us system in order to investigate the mineralization in the reaction solution more clearly with respect to the ions released during the degradation of dzn an examination of the sulfate so4 2 ammonia nh4 phosphate po4 3 and nitrate no3 ions was done post the sonophotocatalytic reaction as is evident from fig 12c during the reaction time of below 30 min the nh4 produced alone showed an increase in quantity from zero to 1 25 mg l when the reaction time was further raised to 120 min the quantities of the mineral ions of nh4 so4 2 po4 2 and no3 were respectively 9 45 3 29 2 46 and 1 53 mg l regarding the nitrogen compounds these results showed that a large portion of the nitrogen most probably combined with the intermediates or lost products like the nitrogen gases regarding the phosphorus and sulfate compounds the results indicated that a majority of the sulfate and phosphate groups in the dzn structure were retained in the byproduct during the early phases of oxidation and then slowly converted into so4 2 and po4 2 ions in fact fu et al reported similar results for the photocatalytic mineralization of methylene blue by the g cofe2o4 they reported no3 formation as proof of the genuine oxidation process 52 in addition it can be seen from fig 12c that there is a rapid increase in the nh4 concentration in contrast no3 increase at a slow rate during the sonophotocatalytic process this is due to that at the beginning of the degradation process the ammonification process occurs in the absence of low oxygen afterwards the generated ammonium will be converted to nitrate by consuming oxygen according to the nitrification process during the degradation of organic pollutants and based on their structure containing nitrogen sulfur and phosphorus etc compounds containing ions intermediate products are first produced which is low at the first time of toc removal process however with increasing reaction time the removal efficiency of toc increases indicating mineralization of organic pollutant to co2 and h2o at the same time the concentration of mineral ions produced in the solution increases due to the breaking of the structure of the intermediate products based on these results the increase in toc removal efficiency and the production of mineral ions during high reaction time are directly related the reduction in the concentration of toc in the aqueous solution during the degradation of dzn along with the production of mineral ions confirms the proper progress of mineralization of dzn as a stable contaminant hammami et al 53 and gholami et al 47 observed an increase in the production of mineral ions during the increase in the removal of toc from reactors containing emerging contaminants through oxidation processes from another side previous studies showed that complete mineralization of an organic compound containing heteroatoms is associated with the formation of co2 and mineral ions 54 in the present study the release of mineral ions is a marker of dzn mineralization the results given from fig 12b and c are indicative of the fact that dnz molecules and its intermediate compounds that generated during the sonophotocatalytic degradation process are finally converted to carbon dioxide and water based on this it can be concluded that sonophotocatalytic process acts as a suitable mineralization process and thus it can be effectively used for the removal of dnz and the generated byproducts from aqueous solution in order to evaluate the biotoxicity of the dzn solution using photolysis photocatalysis and the sonophotocatalytic systems several experiments were conducted to accomplish this the degree of e coli inhibition was estimated in the reaction reactor in which the operating conditions were maintained at ph 7 uv intensity 36 w dzn concentration 50 mg l and us frequency 50 khz in fig 12d the inhibition percentage of the treated solution is shown at different times as evident when the treatment time was raised from zero to 180 min the inhibition rate declined from 47 76 to 30 21 during the photolytic process this rather slight drop in the photolysis could be attributed to more toxic products being formed on the contrary the photocatalytic process lowered the inhibition growth rate of e coli from 47 76 to 15 53 in 180 min of reaction time this outcome is proof that photocatalysis can facilitate the production of a solution low in toxicity in the case of the sonophotocatalytic system the inhibition rate was observed to gradually decrease indicated by a very gentle slope for up to 30 min most likely because of the creation of more toxic products and low levels of mineralization these results connected to the assessment of the production rate of the mineral ions give proof for these findings and barring the nh4 their concentration was zero when the treatment time was increased from 30 to 180 min the inhibition rate showed a significant reduction from 42 73 to 9 65 these results besides confirming the intensity of mineralization elimination of the toc and residual concentration of the mineral ions revealed the effective conversion of the dzn to co2 h2o and reduction in the toxicity using the g cofe2o4 uv us system 4 conclusion to accomplish the dzn degradation the g cofe2o4 nanocomposite was added as a sonophotocatalyst from the diagnostic analyses fesem tem xrd hrtem ftir xps and vsm it was evident that the magnetic nanoparticles below 50 nm in size were loaded onto the graphene as catalysts the suitable values of r2 adjusted r2 and predicted r2 were indicative of the ability of the second order polynomial model to be used as an explanation for all the data the initial ph of all the operational parameters was found to be the most significant in the sonophotocatalytic degradation of the g cofe2o4 when compared against sonolysis photolysis sonocatalysis and the photocatalytic systems greater efficiency of degradation 100 was observed while using the sonophotocatalytic process at 30 min of reaction time in fact even after eight consecutive reaction cycles the g cofe2o4 nanocomposite displayed high degree of stability and recyclability the introduction of the radical scavengers confirmed the formation of the active radical species in the reactor h and oh being the principal active species in the dzn degradation on monitoring the removal efficiency of cod and toc an exceptional level of mineralization was noted after 60 min the mineral ions like so4 2 no3 and po4 3 were identified which besides confirming the efficiency of the toc removal also verified that the dzn was well mineralized within a brief time period from the toxicity analysis the products released during the degradation process were found to be less toxic than the principal contaminant to summarize because of its high efficiency recyclability easy separation and low effluent toxicity the g cofe2o4 uv us system can be regarded as a promising technique to treat dzn contaminated water declaration of competing interest on behalf of all authors the corresponding author states that

13101,the current research study describes the coagulation flocculation process s investigation followed by biological treatment the two landfill simulated reactors were fabricated using an iron sheet of 1 m 1 m 1 1 m in this study landfill reactors were simulated with different operation modes i e reactor1 r1 was operated without rainfall and reactor2 r2 operated at the weighted average actual rainfall rate of 50 years while both contained the waste composition of wet waste 73 and dry waste 27 the type of landfill leachate used for the study was fresh young leachate initially r1 leachate was used to obtain the effective coagulant in terms of coagulant dose and ph using different conventional coagulants i e potash alum kai so₄ ₂ 12h₂o ferric chloride fecl3 ferrous sulphate heptahydrate feso4 7h2o calcium hydroxide ca oh 2 and bentonite clay r1 leachate was used for the acclimatization phase for biomass growth and r2 leachate was used for the treatment phase to check the removal efficiency of varied concentrations of pollution indicator parameters of leachate in the anaerobic filter the leachate r1 was characterized before the pretreatment process and showed that the chemical oxygen demand cod removal percentage was higher for fecl3 with 55 4 at ph 5 in the up flow anaerobic filter s acclimatization phase maximum cod removal was 23 3 while in the treatment phase it was 20 03 23 170 mg l removal of cod for the leachate from the simulated rainfall reactor r2 r2 leachate was characterized before using it for the treatment phase cod s removal efficiency was 35 in coagulation treatment only 20 03 was achieved in the anaerobic filter and overall removal was 51 52 including both the treatment technologies therefore it can be concluded from the study that there was no significant cod removal in the anaerobic filter through the conventional way a further recommendation is to provide a microbial source seeding for biomass growth to improve anaerobic filter efficiency keywords laboratory scale landfill simulator high strength landfill leachate coagulation flocculation process upflow anaerobic filter solid waste composition 1 introduction one of the most critical issues worldwide is solid waste management developing nations like india have a high amount of solid waste generation due to rapid urbanization industrialization poor collection and poor management in the community areas 1 2 generation of leachate develops as rainwater passes through the waste contaminants dissolve in the liquid and leach out from the landfill therefore contaminated leachate is high strength wastewater containing high pollution levels like bod cod ammonium nitrogen etc 3 4 in landfills highly polluted leachate and landfill gases are produced during the waste degradation process through physical chemical and biological reactions and are considered the most threatening by products of the landfill therefore management is the most critical issue addressed in landfills design and operation 5 landfill leachate composition depends on age waste composition and climatic conditions 6 and is generated due to the unscientific way of collection segregation and disposal of waste there are no liners and collection systems at landfill sites in india therefore it is essential to adopt a collection system an onsite proper treatment system to avoid soil pollution groundwater and surface water 6 7 the leachate treatment system s systematic approach may be complex because of the high variability of characteristics and selection methods based on leachate properties 8 in general leachate treatment is usually performed and requires a combination of treatment technologies most of the processes developed for water and wastewater treatment have been adapted to the treatment of landfill leachates includes i biological processes like aerobic anaerobic and nitrification denitrification to organic and nitrogen compounds 9 12 the physicochemical process is effective in removing suspended solids biological parameters 13 15 integrated membrane system with coagulation nanofiltration 16 chemical oxidation process 17 coagulation flocculation process cfs has been widely used as pretreatment and post treatment to remove leachate parameters like colour suspended solids high concentrations of organic pollutants before other biological treatments 18 coagulation is cost effective to treat leachate using aluminum and other compounds 19 studies of the cfs practiced to msw leachate 14 16 20 22 iron based coagulants are used to treat old leachate poly ferric sulphate pfs compared with ferric chloride 6 hydrate fecl3 6h2o and ferric sulphate 7 hydrate feso4 7h2o with an initial cod concentration of 10 623 mg l was found to be higher removal of organic compound 56 38 for pfs 68 65 for ferric chloride 6 hydrate and 55 87 for ferric sulphate 7 hydrate therefore appreciable cod removal specified that cfs as a pretreatment could remove refractory compounds in landfill leachate 23 a study was conducted in the merida landfill leachate with low suspended solids ferric sulphate indicated higher cod removal values 40 at optimum dosage 300 mg l and ph 2 24 in water and wastewater alum ferric chloride ferrous sulphate were commonly used 20 25 compared with aluminum salts iron salts are more efficient with a lower dosage and wider range of ph 25 27 furthermore aluminum salts have been suspected to be carcinogenic mutagenic and more toxic to fishes than organic complexes moreover overdosage of aluminum leads to pollution of surface and groundwater 28 and iron salts are less health risk than aluminum slats 29 the coagulation flocculation process conducted for the treatment of stabilized leachate and ferric chloride was used the removal efficiency of cod was 76 9 at ph 6 30 different coagulants were used to treat the old leachate i e ferric chloride aluminum sulphate aluminum polychloride pax and polyacrylamide polyelectrolytes ferric chloride exhibited better cod efficiency 73 with an actual cod of 4814 mg l than other coagulants 31 ferric chloride is the best coagulant for treating stabilized landfill leachate with variable dosage and ph since the strength of leachate varies with time and the composition of solid waste and changes in dosage and ph of coagulants also occur 32 35 biological treatment is an efficient process for young leachate that has a high amount of organic pollutants with a high bod5 cod ratio and cod 10 000 mg l than stabilized leachate cod 5000 mg l 25 36 37 studies have been conducted on anaerobic treatment of young landfill leachate and stabilized leachate because of the advantage of low energy consumption low amount of sludge generation and high performance in high strength wastewaters 38 45 clogging problems in the operation of anaerobic filters due to suspended solids ss in wastewater have been found by several investigators and have suggested that pretreatment is required before anaerobic treatment and ss control is essential 46 49 treatment of high strength leachate treatment by anaerobic filters with an initial cod of 15 000 mg l and removal efficiency was 50 60 achieved at organic loading rate olr 0 7 2 8 kg m3 however at an olr of 6 kg m3 the removal efficiency was 27 the olr up to 4 g cod day m2 the removal efficiency was 90 with an initial cod of 17 450 mg l and a final value of 1560 mg l 50 the plastic media was used to form biofilm and remove pollutants in the landfill leachate 41 a laboratory scale study was conducted on stabilized leachate cod 2000 mg l by using anaerobic filters therefore the removal efficiency was achieved 90 at 10 c with a 72 h detention time the stabilized leachate cod 3750 mg l and new landfill leachate cod 14000 mg l are treated with anaerobic filters with gravel media to remove cod and the obtained removal efficiency was obtained 90 with an olr of 1 2 kg m3 d 51 therefore studies showed that high loading rates 5 kg cod m3 d of cod removals decrease substantially 52 54 sulphate rich alkaline landfill leachate was treated with an anaerobic filter and fecl3 was used as a reactant and sludge as seeding to the leachate therefore the removal efficiency was between 75 and 90 with a olr of 0 76 7 63 kg cod m3 d 55 based on the objectives of the study the researchers focused on stabilized leachate using coagulation flocculation process as a pretreatment and anaerobic filters as a secondary treatment sludge addition to leachate to increase the removal efficiency no studies in india have focused on fresh young or high strength leachate of age less than 1 year and having high concentration of high organic pollutants such as bod and cod etc furthermore this study attempts the much needed multi stage treatment of such leachate through coagulation flocculation followed by upflow anaerobic filter there is no single processing system that is ideal for all types of wastewater or that can be implemented globally depending on the pollution load wastewater treatment can be achieved by a variety of physical chemical and biological processes the novelty of the work is to treat the high strength leachate using multi stage technology therefore the present study aimed to investigate the removal of organic pollution load from the leachate the objectives of this research were i feasibility of treating high strength leachate from the high amount of organic waste contained msw landfill using combined treatment system i e the coagulation flocculation process followed by an upflow anaerobic filter ii comparing the removal efficiency of different coagulants and their optimum dosages and iii treatability performance of high organic load with an upflow anaerobic filter having support media of plastic rings 2 materials and methods 2 1 design of experiments the experiment doe design was used for the experimental setup to minimize the number of reactors 59 cities of wet and dry compositions of solid waste data of india were considered cpcb 2005 and used to optimize the experiments instead of conducting several experiments with available solid waste compositions the exponential population growth the high density of urban areas diverse cultures changing food habits and lifestyles have seen an unresolved problem in terms of municipal solid waste management mswm in india which is the main reason for the selection of different cities of solid waste composition rather than that of a specific city data as a result it would represent the entire india a full factorial design quadratic model in matlab enabled exploration of all main effects and interaction effects that have been used to optimize the waste composition this design enables us to minimize the time involved in measuring the leachate parameters and monitoring the reactor 2 1 1 design considerations waste compositions wet and dry compositions linear constraint w d 100 five different proportions of waste were calculated based on the model to perform the experiments as shown in table 1 the highest wet to dry ratio is given in table 1 according to survey data the majority of cities in india have wet waste 50 56 waste categorization data is not available in india 57 2 2 waste collection and preparation wet and dry components have been collected from various sources such as vegetable waste from a fancy bazaar guwahati dry waste consists of paper plastic metals from the iitg campus 73 of wet waste and 27 of dry waste were considered in this study as research focused on a high amount of organic waste landfill collected fresh waste was mixed according to the wet and dry ratio and fed into the simulated landfill reactor 2 3 installation and operation of landfill simulated reactor two simulated landfills were employed in the experiment coded as reactor1 r1 and reactor2 r2 the schematic configuration of r1 and r2 is shown in fig 1 r1 and r2 reactors represented conventional landfills where r1 operated without rainfall representing summer season and r2 operated with rainfall representing a rainy season the exact ratio of fresh refuse was wet 73 and dry 27 the simulated landfill with 1 m 1 m 1 1 m was constructed using mild steel with a thickness of 0 012 m the 10 cm headspace was provided even rainfall distribution to the waste operated at the weighted average actual rainfall rate of 50 years 1155 mm 58 the amount of tap water to be added was calculated as per the information of rainfall and reactor size after loading waste to the reactor the simulating reactors were sealed with m seal and silicone sealant and operated in a laboratory environment the leachate was collected once a week in each simulated reactor coded as leachate1 l1 from r1 and leachate l2 from r2 weekly addition of rainfall in the r2 leachate was stored in a collection tank for further analysis and treatment therefore the simulated reactors replicate an anaerobic cell s actual condition unshredded mixed solid waste in open dumpsites in india 2 4 characterization of fresh leachate by standard analysis methods raw leachate was collected from the bottom of the reactor and ph leachate was measured using a ph meter solid analysis method quantifies solids in leachate samples using gravimetric analysis following oven drying total solids dried at 103 105 c total suspended solids dried at 103 105 c fixed and volatile solids ignited at 550 c using muffle furnace turbidity was measured by digital nephelo turbidity meter systronics model number 132 chemical parameters like ph μ ph system 361 132 systronics india and electrical conductivity c digital conductivity meter vsi 04 deluxe india nutrient content namely potassium k and calcium ca were measured using flame photometry flamephotometer128 systronics india biological parameters bod was estimated using winkler smethod and cod cod digester hechdrb200 usa was measured using the closed reflux dichromate method 60 2 5 pretreatment of high strength leachate using the coagulation flocculation process all coagulant chemicals were used in the study including potash alum ferric chloride ferrous sulphate heptahydrate bentonite clay and calcium hydroxide are conventional coagulants used in the treatment of wastewater fresh leachate from reactor1 r1 was used to obtain the optimum dosage and ph using various coagulants the study was initialized by testing the efficiency of the coagulants in the removal of turbidity and optimized dosages of coagulants were further examined at various ph conditions to test their efficiency and suitability at a wide range of ph therefore many coagulants also influence ph in relation to the landfill leachate s ph variability making it challenging to achieve the aimed ph during coagulation flocculation hence those were selected and conducted the laboratory analysis for analyzing the optimum dosage and ph values the fresh young leachate generated from reactor1 has been used as a pretreatment process coagulation was carried out using each coagulant at different ph and dosages to perform the above analysis at a laboratory scale the velocity of the mixing and sedimentation was the same for all coagulants the standard 1 l glass beakers were used and the stirring rate was 120 rpm at 1 min and 30 rpm at 20 min the floc allowed to settle after that the supernatant was analyzed for cod and tss concentration according to standard methods the removal efficiency of total suspended solids tss and cod was obtained 2 6 biological treatment of young high strength landfill leachate 2 6 1 upflow anaerobic filter system design and operational condition laboratory scale up flow anaerobic filters packed with plastic rings were constructed in series as shown in fig 2 one reactor was designed with a column height of 6 ft a total liquid volume of 40 l and a working volume of 32 l assumed one column consisted of an acrylic glass column with an inside diameter of 11 4 cm and 3 mm the corrugated plastic rings were used as media of etip 25 grade with a one inch diameter and 1 mm gauge with 85 kg m3 of specific weight plastic media was selected due to a specific surface area to grow the biofilm over the media and the void ratio is 0 9 m3 m3 the anaerobic filters operated at room temperature 15 40 c and the filter s specific surface area was 175 m2 m3 on average the specific packing surface area is 100 m2 m3 59 peristaltic pumps were used to feed the leachate into the reactor and maintain the required recirculation flow the 5 days hrt was maintained during the operation period the olr is 5 kg cod m3 d as the literature suggested that 5 22 kg cod m3 d have been successfully applied to anaerobic filters treating other wastes 60 the acclimatization phase startup phase was done for 5 months to develop biofilm which consumes the organic solids in high strength leachate the biomass requires 2 4 months to develop the biofilm at favorable conditions which requires consuming the organic solids available in it by filtration mechanism 61 the treatment phase was done with reactor r2 leachate operated with addition of rainfall the pretreatment was given to r2 leachate before treating it with an anaerobic filter because the concentration of leachates changes with time besides that optimum dosage and ph also changes therefore before an anaerobic filter leachate pretreatment is necessary to remove suspended solids not to clog anaerobic filters 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of young fresh leachate initially r1 leachate was used to obtain the effective coagulant in terms of coagulant dose and ph using different conventional coagulants i e potash alum kai so₄ ₂ 12h₂o ferric chloride fecl3 ferrous sulphate heptahydrate feso4 7h2o calcium hydroxide ca oh 2 and bentonite clay the significance of selecting these coagulants is because of aluminum and iron coagulants effectiveness primarily from their ability to form multi charged polynuclear complexes with enhanced adsorption properties polymer like bentonite clay can destabilize the flocculation process initial characterization of leachate l1 was carried out to obtain the landfill leachate s pollution load as illustrated in table 2 for young leachate a high concentration of organics low ph value and higher bod cod ratio were observed bod5 and cod concentrations ranged from 7041 to 39 130 and cod 15692 71 630 mg l for the leachate which is of age less than 2 years 57 the average bod5 cod ratio of leachate was 0 5 which explains a large amount of non biodegradable materials were present and not in the stabilized stage therefore indicates a high amount of organic compounds that are partially degraded and the value is higher in young leachate 62 3 2 optimization of coagulant dosage and ph for stored landfill leachate r1 3 2 1 potash alum kai so₄ ₂ 12h₂o experiments were first conducted with optimum dosage while measuring the maximum reduction in turbidity concerning the various coagulant dosages as shown in fig 3 the sample s initial turbidity was 750 ntu and the minimum post treatment turbidity obtained was 45 ntu however a maximum of 96 7 removal efficiency was achieved at 4 g l of alum dosage experiments were performed at various ph levels by plotting the values between various ph levels and the percentage of reduction in turbidity as shown in fig 3 the better findings were acquired at a ph of 8 obtaining the maximum reduction percentage potash alum reacts with calcium bicarbonate in leachate and forms a white gelatinous al oh 3 as shown in eq 1 1 2 kal s o 4 2 3 ca hc o 3 2 3 caso 4 k 2 so 4 2 al oh 3 6 co 2 3 2 2 ferric chloride fecl3 the mode of operation for ferric chloride was similar to the potash alum experiments were first conducted with optimum dosage while measuring the maximum reduction in turbidity concerning the various coagulant dosages as shown in fig 4 the sample s initial turbidity is 874 ntu and a maximum reduction in turbidity was obtained with final turbidity of 40 ntu however a maximum of 95 4 removal efficiency was achieved at 3 25 g l of alum dosage experiments were performed at various ph levels by plotting the values between various ph levels and the percentage of turbidity reduction as shown in fig 4 the better findings were acquired at a ph of 5 9 11 obtaining the maximum turbidity reduction fecl3 reacts with calcium bicarbonate and forms the fe oh 2 a brown precipitate as shown in eq 2 2 2 fecl 3 3 ca hc o 3 2 2 fe oh 3 3 cacl 3 6 co 2 3 2 3 ferrous sulphate heptahydrate feso4 7h2o optimum dosage aims to measure the maximum reduction in turbidity concerning the various coagulant dosages as shown in fig 5 the sample s initial turbidity is 830 ntu and the minimum post treatment turbidity of 16 ntu was obtained however a maximum of 98 removal efficiency was achieved at 13 g l of alum dosage experiments were performed at various ph levels by plotting the values between various ph levels and the percentage of reduction in turbidity as shown in fig 5 the optimum ph was found to be 11 obtaining the maximum turbidity reduction feso4 7h2o reacts with calcium bicarbonate and forms the fe oh 3 a brown precipitate as shown in eq 3 feso 4 7 h 2 o ca hc o 3 2 fe hc o 3 2 caso 4 7 h 2 o 3 4fe hco3 2 o2 2h2o 4fe oh 2 3 2 4 calcium hydroxide ca oh 2 experiments were subsequently conducted to obtain the maximum reduction in turbidity with the various coagulant dosages as shown in fig 6 the sample s initial turbidity is 830 ntu and a maximum reduction in turbidity was obtained with the final turbidity as 17 ntu however a maximum of 98 removal efficiency was achieved at 17 g l of alum dosage experiments were performed at various ph levels by plotting the values between various ph levels and the percentage of reduction in turbidity as shown in fig 6 the optimum ph was found to be 5 and 11 obtaining the maximum turbidity reduction ca oh 2 reacts with ca hco3 2 in leachate and forms a white gelatinous caco3 as shown in eq 4 4 ca hc o 3 2 ca oh 2 2 caco 3 2 h 2 o 3 2 5 bentonite clay experiments were subsequently conducted to obtain the maximum reduction in turbidity with the various coagulant dosages as shown in fig 7 the sample s initial turbidity is 874 ntu and the maximum reduction in turbidity was 17 ntu was obtained however a maximum of 98 removal efficiency was achieved at 15 g l of alum dosage experiments were performed at various ph levels by plotting the values between various ph levels and the percentage of reduction in turbidity as shown in fig 7 the optimum ph was found to be 7 obtaining the maximum turbidity reduction 3 3 overall comparison of the characterization of leachate with various coagulants the optimal coagulant dosage and ph were calculated in the analysis and stored leachate is clariflocculated with a detention period of 2 2 5 h 63 the percentage of cod and toc removal from coagulation flocculation was normally 10 25 for young leachates but is highest 50 65 for low bod5 cod ratio leachates stabilized leachates 25 to obtain cod bod5 and tss removal efficiency the obtained optimum dosage was used the fresh leachate concentrations of suspended solids were relatively high the 94 1 reduction in tss as colloidal particles has been destabilized due to heavily charged partially hydrolyzed metallic ions 64 over 97 of tss had been removed with fecl3 at ph 5 whereas other iron coagulants showed less removal than fecl3 bentonite clay also had 96 removal efficiency at a ph of 7 whereas ca oh 2 showed 92 47 removal at a ph of 11 comparatively greater removal of suspended solids at lower and higher ph values was observed 14 reported that 95 of suspended solids have been testified at lower and higher ph values 4 and 12 over 55 4 of cod removal was obtained at low coagulant dosage 3 25 g l and ph 5 than alum 49 1 and a dose of 4 g l at ph 8 respectively ca oh 2 removed only 48 1 of cod and 27 of bod5 at ph 11 and dosage of 17 g l which indicates a higher amount of dosage could perform poorly in removing all contaminants others have reported that 48 1 of cod removal at 17 g l fe so 4 7h2o dose the removal proportions of 36 2 and less than 30 of bod5 were attained using fe so 4 7h2o and fecl3 the maximum removal of cod 55 4 was observed at a dose of 3 25 g l at a ph of 5 as the coagulant dosages varied leachate has adjusted to ph from 4 to 15 showed good results of suspended solids cod removed reasonably at lower dosage and ph overall fecl3 was found to be higher than other coagulants for the removal of all contaminants at ph 8 5 the removal of contaminants was fairly low the obtained outcomes are valid with other reports of fecl3 and potash alum was applied to wastewater and leachate 14 31 65 66 the precipitation of soluble organics with the coagulant is usually due to cod via these coagulants 67 they have reported that better performance was achieved at ph 5 for fecl3 and 5 5 with alum turbidity removal is less effective in the alkaline region than in the low ph region 25 this is in agreement with the results obtained by other authors and similar results were obtained in their experiments with leachate cfs 20 68 the significant removal of organic colloids was obtained through different coagulants and the coagulation flocculation process effectively removes particulate cod in leachate the study proves that the high amount of cod present in the leachate was particulate cod colloid residual matter based on the cod removal by the cfs in other words the results of this investigation proved that the alum and iron dosage range for good coagulation was almost wide this study proved that a good amount of solid removal was achieved i e 97 of ss removal when ferric chloride was used as a coagulant and a further load of the pollutant was decreased to the biological treatment clearly reveal that iron salts are more efficient than aluminum ones resulting in sufficient cod reductions up to 50 whereas the corresponding values in ca oh 2 and feso4 7h2o using bioflocculant rhizomonas obtained cod removal was 40 at a dosage of 0 02 g l 69 70 reported a 39 of cod were removed using fecl3 in recent works 47 of cod reduction has been attained with feso4 7h2o at a dosage of 12 g l 71 this indicates that feso4 7h2o presents less cod removal with ph values close to neutrality on the other hand when the ph value fluctuates between 8 and 10 the cod removal is reduced because the fe3 cations stabilize the colloidal particles by allowing them to be positively charged 72 however combining coagulants 73 or adding flocculants along with coagulants may improve floc settling rate 74 and hence process performance cod reduction up to 50 however there are certain drawbacks to this treatment including a steady sludge volume and an increase in the content of aluminum or iron in the liquid phase comparison between different coagulants and their removal efficiency among organic parameters were shown in table 3 3 4 anaerobic system startup and acclimatization the total startup time was 36 weeks at a room temperature of 15 40 c the upflow anaerobic filter setup was a single reactor attached biofilm system plastic pall rings were used as a surface for the growth of biofilm were chosen as they have a specific area and large porosity to attach a large quantity of microorganisms as a result it allows high strength leachate treatment with a high concentration load with significant production efficiency above a minimum of about 2 m reactor height seems to have little effect on performance 59 this study s reactor has a height of 6 ft 1 897 m designed to investigate the filter s performance the relative height of the medium within the reactor is a more significant parameter too little media appears to allow the excessive loss of solids and reduce cod removal 75 plastic media is more efficient than other media in wastewater treatment allowing good microbial growth due to high specific surface area and low molecular weight 3 4 1 ph variation and cod reduction during the acclimatization process of up flow anaerobic filter packed with plastic media after pretreatment the initial ph of high strength leachate was 5 1 highly acidic the leachate cod is 21 320 mg l and the bod is 14 070 mg l the bod cod ratio had 0 64 after pretreatment leachate s high strength has been given as continuous feed to the anaerobic filter for 60 days in a conventional manner the cod reduction and ph are shown in fig 4 when treating influent cod the filter performance packed with plastic media is 23 300 mg l and operating hrt at 5 days however the cod reduction from its initial value of 23 300 mg l to 17 856 mg l was observed at an hrt of 5 days the overall efficiency for cod removal was 23 3 only 23 3 cod removal was obtained at a high loading rate of 5 kg cod m3 d a related study indicated that 27 7 was achieved with an olr of 6 kg cod m3 d 38 throughout the startup phase ph was not controlled influent and effluent ph variations were shown in fig 8 during the startup period the results of ph effluent changes from 5 1 to 4 90 for studied olr which also indicated an accumulation of volatile fatty acids the study results show that anaerobic filters are capable of treating acidic waste with a ph of 5 in agreement with another report leachate s anaerobic treatment with low ph was performed but raw leachate was diluted with water 41 51 demonstrated that an anaerobic filter could reduce the cod mature landfill by 90 at loading rates varying from 1 26 to 1 45 kg cod m 3 day 1 the specific surface area random packing of plastic media provided better performance even though filter performance was not high which could be attributed to the high leachate concentration and low ph a long retention time of 5 days was used to allow the biomass to populate and attach to the medium while preventing biomass washout 3 4 2 treatment phase of high strength pretreated leachate the high strength leachate from reactor2 has a wet 73 and dry 27 waste composition simulated with rainfall the pretreatment has given to the leachate before using further tr obtaining an optimum dosage of 50 mg l and ph 8 2 the initial cod of l2 ranged from 44 000 mg l to 48 000 mg l optimum dosage and ph were used to treat leachate then fed to the anaerobic filter packed with plastic media the anaerobic filter effluent characteristics with different hydraulic loading rates hrt as shown in table 4 different hrts have been examined to check the performance of the anaerobic filter packed with plastic media the initial ph was 6 59 and the influent cod was 32 651 mg l and decreased to 28 632 mg l the efficiency was 12 31 and gradually increased to 20 03 as ph increased to 8 02 it indicates that ph and hrt are also significant factors in anaerobic filter performance at 5 days hrt the average influent cod concentrations were 32 651 to 28 975 mg l and effluent cod concentrations ranged from 28 632 23 170 mg l removal efficiencies were ranged from 12 31 to 20 03 at 4 days hrt cod concentrations were ranged from 30 765 mg l to 29 100 and removal efficiency was 13 7 to 15 46 therefore a 20 reduction in cod removal efficiency was observed at 5 days hrt when compared with 4 days hrt only a 15 46 reduction in cod removal was observed 4 conclusions significant conclusions were drawn from the current work it has been shown that anaerobic filters with high loading rates and highly acidic leachate can be treated but the desired effluent quality is difficult to achieve because of a high amount of organics in influent leachate it could be concluded that the combined treatment of leachate coagulation flocculation and anaerobic filter has given promising results for the treatment of high strength leachate and a further improvement in treatment efficiency may be necessary with the addition of microbial source for the growth of biomass i coagulation flocculation studies conducted on high strength landfill leachate from simulated landfill reactor indicated that fecl3 could remove suspended solids 97 3 and cod 55 4 at a low dosage at ph 5 which is a better performance as compared to other coagulants like alum fe so 4 7h2o bentonite clay ii fecl3 proved as the best coagulant among other coagulants for treating fresh leachates where a high amount of inorganic and organic colloids were present the study proves that the high amount of cod present in the leachate was particulate cod colloid residual matter based on the cod removal by the cfs iii the addition of fecl3 resulted in the formation of precipitates by raising the dose resulting in a high quantity of ss formed in the effluent and filter influent this could contribute to the anaerobic filter s low performance due to inorganics buildup in the filter medium therefore the research discussed the important factors affecting the relationship between the two stages of coagulation flocculation and anaerobic filter treatment iv through physicochemical treatment the cod value reached 32 100 mg l finally after anaerobic filter treatment cod of 23 170 mg l was obtained cod removal was 35 in coagulation treatment 20 03 in the anaerobic filter and overall removal was 51 52 including both phases the fecl3 appears to be a promising option for the pretreatment of biological techniques and removing colloidal particles and organic macromolecules however anaerobic filters are capable of treating acidic ph

13101,the current research study describes the coagulation flocculation process s investigation followed by biological treatment the two landfill simulated reactors were fabricated using an iron sheet of 1 m 1 m 1 1 m in this study landfill reactors were simulated with different operation modes i e reactor1 r1 was operated without rainfall and reactor2 r2 operated at the weighted average actual rainfall rate of 50 years while both contained the waste composition of wet waste 73 and dry waste 27 the type of landfill leachate used for the study was fresh young leachate initially r1 leachate was used to obtain the effective coagulant in terms of coagulant dose and ph using different conventional coagulants i e potash alum kai so₄ ₂ 12h₂o ferric chloride fecl3 ferrous sulphate heptahydrate feso4 7h2o calcium hydroxide ca oh 2 and bentonite clay r1 leachate was used for the acclimatization phase for biomass growth and r2 leachate was used for the treatment phase to check the removal efficiency of varied concentrations of pollution indicator parameters of leachate in the anaerobic filter the leachate r1 was characterized before the pretreatment process and showed that the chemical oxygen demand cod removal percentage was higher for fecl3 with 55 4 at ph 5 in the up flow anaerobic filter s acclimatization phase maximum cod removal was 23 3 while in the treatment phase it was 20 03 23 170 mg l removal of cod for the leachate from the simulated rainfall reactor r2 r2 leachate was characterized before using it for the treatment phase cod s removal efficiency was 35 in coagulation treatment only 20 03 was achieved in the anaerobic filter and overall removal was 51 52 including both the treatment technologies therefore it can be concluded from the study that there was no significant cod removal in the anaerobic filter through the conventional way a further recommendation is to provide a microbial source seeding for biomass growth to improve anaerobic filter efficiency keywords laboratory scale landfill simulator high strength landfill leachate coagulation flocculation process upflow anaerobic filter solid waste composition 1 introduction one of the most critical issues worldwide is solid waste management developing nations like india have a high amount of solid waste generation due to rapid urbanization industrialization poor collection and poor management in the community areas 1 2 generation of leachate develops as rainwater passes through the waste contaminants dissolve in the liquid and leach out from the landfill therefore contaminated leachate is high strength wastewater containing high pollution levels like bod cod ammonium nitrogen etc 3 4 in landfills highly polluted leachate and landfill gases are produced during the waste degradation process through physical chemical and biological reactions and are considered the most threatening by products of the landfill therefore management is the most critical issue addressed in landfills design and operation 5 landfill leachate composition depends on age waste composition and climatic conditions 6 and is generated due to the unscientific way of collection segregation and disposal of waste there are no liners and collection systems at landfill sites in india therefore it is essential to adopt a collection system an onsite proper treatment system to avoid soil pollution groundwater and surface water 6 7 the leachate treatment system s systematic approach may be complex because of the high variability of characteristics and selection methods based on leachate properties 8 in general leachate treatment is usually performed and requires a combination of treatment technologies most of the processes developed for water and wastewater treatment have been adapted to the treatment of landfill leachates includes i biological processes like aerobic anaerobic and nitrification denitrification to organic and nitrogen compounds 9 12 the physicochemical process is effective in removing suspended solids biological parameters 13 15 integrated membrane system with coagulation nanofiltration 16 chemical oxidation process 17 coagulation flocculation process cfs has been widely used as pretreatment and post treatment to remove leachate parameters like colour suspended solids high concentrations of organic pollutants before other biological treatments 18 coagulation is cost effective to treat leachate using aluminum and other compounds 19 studies of the cfs practiced to msw leachate 14 16 20 22 iron based coagulants are used to treat old leachate poly ferric sulphate pfs compared with ferric chloride 6 hydrate fecl3 6h2o and ferric sulphate 7 hydrate feso4 7h2o with an initial cod concentration of 10 623 mg l was found to be higher removal of organic compound 56 38 for pfs 68 65 for ferric chloride 6 hydrate and 55 87 for ferric sulphate 7 hydrate therefore appreciable cod removal specified that cfs as a pretreatment could remove refractory compounds in landfill leachate 23 a study was conducted in the merida landfill leachate with low suspended solids ferric sulphate indicated higher cod removal values 40 at optimum dosage 300 mg l and ph 2 24 in water and wastewater alum ferric chloride ferrous sulphate were commonly used 20 25 compared with aluminum salts iron salts are more efficient with a lower dosage and wider range of ph 25 27 furthermore aluminum salts have been suspected to be carcinogenic mutagenic and more toxic to fishes than organic complexes moreover overdosage of aluminum leads to pollution of surface and groundwater 28 and iron salts are less health risk than aluminum slats 29 the coagulation flocculation process conducted for the treatment of stabilized leachate and ferric chloride was used the removal efficiency of cod was 76 9 at ph 6 30 different coagulants were used to treat the old leachate i e ferric chloride aluminum sulphate aluminum polychloride pax and polyacrylamide polyelectrolytes ferric chloride exhibited better cod efficiency 73 with an actual cod of 4814 mg l than other coagulants 31 ferric chloride is the best coagulant for treating stabilized landfill leachate with variable dosage and ph since the strength of leachate varies with time and the composition of solid waste and changes in dosage and ph of coagulants also occur 32 35 biological treatment is an efficient process for young leachate that has a high amount of organic pollutants with a high bod5 cod ratio and cod 10 000 mg l than stabilized leachate cod 5000 mg l 25 36 37 studies have been conducted on anaerobic treatment of young landfill leachate and stabilized leachate because of the advantage of low energy consumption low amount of sludge generation and high performance in high strength wastewaters 38 45 clogging problems in the operation of anaerobic filters due to suspended solids ss in wastewater have been found by several investigators and have suggested that pretreatment is required before anaerobic treatment and ss control is essential 46 49 treatment of high strength leachate treatment by anaerobic filters with an initial cod of 15 000 mg l and removal efficiency was 50 60 achieved at organic loading rate olr 0 7 2 8 kg m3 however at an olr of 6 kg m3 the removal efficiency was 27 the olr up to 4 g cod day m2 the removal efficiency was 90 with an initial cod of 17 450 mg l and a final value of 1560 mg l 50 the plastic media was used to form biofilm and remove pollutants in the landfill leachate 41 a laboratory scale study was conducted on stabilized leachate cod 2000 mg l by using anaerobic filters therefore the removal efficiency was achieved 90 at 10 c with a 72 h detention time the stabilized leachate cod 3750 mg l and new landfill leachate cod 14000 mg l are treated with anaerobic filters with gravel media to remove cod and the obtained removal efficiency was obtained 90 with an olr of 1 2 kg m3 d 51 therefore studies showed that high loading rates 5 kg cod m3 d of cod removals decrease substantially 52 54 sulphate rich alkaline landfill leachate was treated with an anaerobic filter and fecl3 was used as a reactant and sludge as seeding to the leachate therefore the removal efficiency was between 75 and 90 with a olr of 0 76 7 63 kg cod m3 d 55 based on the objectives of the study the researchers focused on stabilized leachate using coagulation flocculation process as a pretreatment and anaerobic filters as a secondary treatment sludge addition to leachate to increase the removal efficiency no studies in india have focused on fresh young or high strength leachate of age less than 1 year and having high concentration of high organic pollutants such as bod and cod etc furthermore this study attempts the much needed multi stage treatment of such leachate through coagulation flocculation followed by upflow anaerobic filter there is no single processing system that is ideal for all types of wastewater or that can be implemented globally depending on the pollution load wastewater treatment can be achieved by a variety of physical chemical and biological processes the novelty of the work is to treat the high strength leachate using multi stage technology therefore the present study aimed to investigate the removal of organic pollution load from the leachate the objectives of this research were i feasibility of treating high strength leachate from the high amount of organic waste contained msw landfill using combined treatment system i e the coagulation flocculation process followed by an upflow anaerobic filter ii comparing the removal efficiency of different coagulants and their optimum dosages and iii treatability performance of high organic load with an upflow anaerobic filter having support media of plastic rings 2 materials and methods 2 1 design of experiments the experiment doe design was used for the experimental setup to minimize the number of reactors 59 cities of wet and dry compositions of solid waste data of india were considered cpcb 2005 and used to optimize the experiments instead of conducting several experiments with available solid waste compositions the exponential population growth the high density of urban areas diverse cultures changing food habits and lifestyles have seen an unresolved problem in terms of municipal solid waste management mswm in india which is the main reason for the selection of different cities of solid waste composition rather than that of a specific city data as a result it would represent the entire india a full factorial design quadratic model in matlab enabled exploration of all main effects and interaction effects that have been used to optimize the waste composition this design enables us to minimize the time involved in measuring the leachate parameters and monitoring the reactor 2 1 1 design considerations waste compositions wet and dry compositions linear constraint w d 100 five different proportions of waste were calculated based on the model to perform the experiments as shown in table 1 the highest wet to dry ratio is given in table 1 according to survey data the majority of cities in india have wet waste 50 56 waste categorization data is not available in india 57 2 2 waste collection and preparation wet and dry components have been collected from various sources such as vegetable waste from a fancy bazaar guwahati dry waste consists of paper plastic metals from the iitg campus 73 of wet waste and 27 of dry waste were considered in this study as research focused on a high amount of organic waste landfill collected fresh waste was mixed according to the wet and dry ratio and fed into the simulated landfill reactor 2 3 installation and operation of landfill simulated reactor two simulated landfills were employed in the experiment coded as reactor1 r1 and reactor2 r2 the schematic configuration of r1 and r2 is shown in fig 1 r1 and r2 reactors represented conventional landfills where r1 operated without rainfall representing summer season and r2 operated with rainfall representing a rainy season the exact ratio of fresh refuse was wet 73 and dry 27 the simulated landfill with 1 m 1 m 1 1 m was constructed using mild steel with a thickness of 0 012 m the 10 cm headspace was provided even rainfall distribution to the waste operated at the weighted average actual rainfall rate of 50 years 1155 mm 58 the amount of tap water to be added was calculated as per the information of rainfall and reactor size after loading waste to the reactor the simulating reactors were sealed with m seal and silicone sealant and operated in a laboratory environment the leachate was collected once a week in each simulated reactor coded as leachate1 l1 from r1 and leachate l2 from r2 weekly addition of rainfall in the r2 leachate was stored in a collection tank for further analysis and treatment therefore the simulated reactors replicate an anaerobic cell s actual condition unshredded mixed solid waste in open dumpsites in india 2 4 characterization of fresh leachate by standard analysis methods raw leachate was collected from the bottom of the reactor and ph leachate was measured using a ph meter solid analysis method quantifies solids in leachate samples using gravimetric analysis following oven drying total solids dried at 103 105 c total suspended solids dried at 103 105 c fixed and volatile solids ignited at 550 c using muffle furnace turbidity was measured by digital nephelo turbidity meter systronics model number 132 chemical parameters like ph μ ph system 361 132 systronics india and electrical conductivity c digital conductivity meter vsi 04 deluxe india nutrient content namely potassium k and calcium ca were measured using flame photometry flamephotometer128 systronics india biological parameters bod was estimated using winkler smethod and cod cod digester hechdrb200 usa was measured using the closed reflux dichromate method 60 2 5 pretreatment of high strength leachate using the coagulation flocculation process all coagulant chemicals were used in the study including potash alum ferric chloride ferrous sulphate heptahydrate bentonite clay and calcium hydroxide are conventional coagulants used in the treatment of wastewater fresh leachate from reactor1 r1 was used to obtain the optimum dosage and ph using various coagulants the study was initialized by testing the efficiency of the coagulants in the removal of turbidity and optimized dosages of coagulants were further examined at various ph conditions to test their efficiency and suitability at a wide range of ph therefore many coagulants also influence ph in relation to the landfill leachate s ph variability making it challenging to achieve the aimed ph during coagulation flocculation hence those were selected and conducted the laboratory analysis for analyzing the optimum dosage and ph values the fresh young leachate generated from reactor1 has been used as a pretreatment process coagulation was carried out using each coagulant at different ph and dosages to perform the above analysis at a laboratory scale the velocity of the mixing and sedimentation was the same for all coagulants the standard 1 l glass beakers were used and the stirring rate was 120 rpm at 1 min and 30 rpm at 20 min the floc allowed to settle after that the supernatant was analyzed for cod and tss concentration according to standard methods the removal efficiency of total suspended solids tss and cod was obtained 2 6 biological treatment of young high strength landfill leachate 2 6 1 upflow anaerobic filter system design and operational condition laboratory scale up flow anaerobic filters packed with plastic rings were constructed in series as shown in fig 2 one reactor was designed with a column height of 6 ft a total liquid volume of 40 l and a working volume of 32 l assumed one column consisted of an acrylic glass column with an inside diameter of 11 4 cm and 3 mm the corrugated plastic rings were used as media of etip 25 grade with a one inch diameter and 1 mm gauge with 85 kg m3 of specific weight plastic media was selected due to a specific surface area to grow the biofilm over the media and the void ratio is 0 9 m3 m3 the anaerobic filters operated at room temperature 15 40 c and the filter s specific surface area was 175 m2 m3 on average the specific packing surface area is 100 m2 m3 59 peristaltic pumps were used to feed the leachate into the reactor and maintain the required recirculation flow the 5 days hrt was maintained during the operation period the olr is 5 kg cod m3 d as the literature suggested that 5 22 kg cod m3 d have been successfully applied to anaerobic filters treating other wastes 60 the acclimatization phase startup phase was done for 5 months to develop biofilm which consumes the organic solids in high strength leachate the biomass requires 2 4 months to develop the biofilm at favorable conditions which requires consuming the organic solids available in it by filtration mechanism 61 the treatment phase was done with reactor r2 leachate operated with addition of rainfall the pretreatment was given to r2 leachate before treating it with an anaerobic filter because the concentration of leachates changes with time besides that optimum dosage and ph also changes therefore before an anaerobic filter leachate pretreatment is necessary to remove suspended solids not to clog anaerobic filters 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of young fresh leachate initially r1 leachate was used to obtain the effective coagulant in terms of coagulant dose and ph using different conventional coagulants i e potash alum kai so₄ ₂ 12h₂o ferric chloride fecl3 ferrous sulphate heptahydrate feso4 7h2o calcium hydroxide ca oh 2 and bentonite clay the significance of selecting these coagulants is because of aluminum and iron coagulants effectiveness primarily from their ability to form multi charged polynuclear complexes with enhanced adsorption properties polymer like bentonite clay can destabilize the flocculation process initial characterization of leachate l1 was carried out to obtain the landfill leachate s pollution load as illustrated in table 2 for young leachate a high concentration of organics low ph value and higher bod cod ratio were observed bod5 and cod concentrations ranged from 7041 to 39 130 and cod 15692 71 630 mg l for the leachate which is of age less than 2 years 57 the average bod5 cod ratio of leachate was 0 5 which explains a large amount of non biodegradable materials were present and not in the stabilized stage therefore indicates a high amount of organic compounds that are partially degraded and the value is higher in young leachate 62 3 2 optimization of coagulant dosage and ph for stored landfill leachate r1 3 2 1 potash alum kai so₄ ₂ 12h₂o experiments were first conducted with optimum dosage while measuring the maximum reduction in turbidity concerning the various coagulant dosages as shown in fig 3 the sample s initial turbidity was 750 ntu and the minimum post treatment turbidity obtained was 45 ntu however a maximum of 96 7 removal efficiency was achieved at 4 g l of alum dosage experiments were performed at various ph levels by plotting the values between various ph levels and the percentage of reduction in turbidity as shown in fig 3 the better findings were acquired at a ph of 8 obtaining the maximum reduction percentage potash alum reacts with calcium bicarbonate in leachate and forms a white gelatinous al oh 3 as shown in eq 1 1 2 kal s o 4 2 3 ca hc o 3 2 3 caso 4 k 2 so 4 2 al oh 3 6 co 2 3 2 2 ferric chloride fecl3 the mode of operation for ferric chloride was similar to the potash alum experiments were first conducted with optimum dosage while measuring the maximum reduction in turbidity concerning the various coagulant dosages as shown in fig 4 the sample s initial turbidity is 874 ntu and a maximum reduction in turbidity was obtained with final turbidity of 40 ntu however a maximum of 95 4 removal efficiency was achieved at 3 25 g l of alum dosage experiments were performed at various ph levels by plotting the values between various ph levels and the percentage of turbidity reduction as shown in fig 4 the better findings were acquired at a ph of 5 9 11 obtaining the maximum turbidity reduction fecl3 reacts with calcium bicarbonate and forms the fe oh 2 a brown precipitate as shown in eq 2 2 2 fecl 3 3 ca hc o 3 2 2 fe oh 3 3 cacl 3 6 co 2 3 2 3 ferrous sulphate heptahydrate feso4 7h2o optimum dosage aims to measure the maximum reduction in turbidity concerning the various coagulant dosages as shown in fig 5 the sample s initial turbidity is 830 ntu and the minimum post treatment turbidity of 16 ntu was obtained however a maximum of 98 removal efficiency was achieved at 13 g l of alum dosage experiments were performed at various ph levels by plotting the values between various ph levels and the percentage of reduction in turbidity as shown in fig 5 the optimum ph was found to be 11 obtaining the maximum turbidity reduction feso4 7h2o reacts with calcium bicarbonate and forms the fe oh 3 a brown precipitate as shown in eq 3 feso 4 7 h 2 o ca hc o 3 2 fe hc o 3 2 caso 4 7 h 2 o 3 4fe hco3 2 o2 2h2o 4fe oh 2 3 2 4 calcium hydroxide ca oh 2 experiments were subsequently conducted to obtain the maximum reduction in turbidity with the various coagulant dosages as shown in fig 6 the sample s initial turbidity is 830 ntu and a maximum reduction in turbidity was obtained with the final turbidity as 17 ntu however a maximum of 98 removal efficiency was achieved at 17 g l of alum dosage experiments were performed at various ph levels by plotting the values between various ph levels and the percentage of reduction in turbidity as shown in fig 6 the optimum ph was found to be 5 and 11 obtaining the maximum turbidity reduction ca oh 2 reacts with ca hco3 2 in leachate and forms a white gelatinous caco3 as shown in eq 4 4 ca hc o 3 2 ca oh 2 2 caco 3 2 h 2 o 3 2 5 bentonite clay experiments were subsequently conducted to obtain the maximum reduction in turbidity with the various coagulant dosages as shown in fig 7 the sample s initial turbidity is 874 ntu and the maximum reduction in turbidity was 17 ntu was obtained however a maximum of 98 removal efficiency was achieved at 15 g l of alum dosage experiments were performed at various ph levels by plotting the values between various ph levels and the percentage of reduction in turbidity as shown in fig 7 the optimum ph was found to be 7 obtaining the maximum turbidity reduction 3 3 overall comparison of the characterization of leachate with various coagulants the optimal coagulant dosage and ph were calculated in the analysis and stored leachate is clariflocculated with a detention period of 2 2 5 h 63 the percentage of cod and toc removal from coagulation flocculation was normally 10 25 for young leachates but is highest 50 65 for low bod5 cod ratio leachates stabilized leachates 25 to obtain cod bod5 and tss removal efficiency the obtained optimum dosage was used the fresh leachate concentrations of suspended solids were relatively high the 94 1 reduction in tss as colloidal particles has been destabilized due to heavily charged partially hydrolyzed metallic ions 64 over 97 of tss had been removed with fecl3 at ph 5 whereas other iron coagulants showed less removal than fecl3 bentonite clay also had 96 removal efficiency at a ph of 7 whereas ca oh 2 showed 92 47 removal at a ph of 11 comparatively greater removal of suspended solids at lower and higher ph values was observed 14 reported that 95 of suspended solids have been testified at lower and higher ph values 4 and 12 over 55 4 of cod removal was obtained at low coagulant dosage 3 25 g l and ph 5 than alum 49 1 and a dose of 4 g l at ph 8 respectively ca oh 2 removed only 48 1 of cod and 27 of bod5 at ph 11 and dosage of 17 g l which indicates a higher amount of dosage could perform poorly in removing all contaminants others have reported that 48 1 of cod removal at 17 g l fe so 4 7h2o dose the removal proportions of 36 2 and less than 30 of bod5 were attained using fe so 4 7h2o and fecl3 the maximum removal of cod 55 4 was observed at a dose of 3 25 g l at a ph of 5 as the coagulant dosages varied leachate has adjusted to ph from 4 to 15 showed good results of suspended solids cod removed reasonably at lower dosage and ph overall fecl3 was found to be higher than other coagulants for the removal of all contaminants at ph 8 5 the removal of contaminants was fairly low the obtained outcomes are valid with other reports of fecl3 and potash alum was applied to wastewater and leachate 14 31 65 66 the precipitation of soluble organics with the coagulant is usually due to cod via these coagulants 67 they have reported that better performance was achieved at ph 5 for fecl3 and 5 5 with alum turbidity removal is less effective in the alkaline region than in the low ph region 25 this is in agreement with the results obtained by other authors and similar results were obtained in their experiments with leachate cfs 20 68 the significant removal of organic colloids was obtained through different coagulants and the coagulation flocculation process effectively removes particulate cod in leachate the study proves that the high amount of cod present in the leachate was particulate cod colloid residual matter based on the cod removal by the cfs in other words the results of this investigation proved that the alum and iron dosage range for good coagulation was almost wide this study proved that a good amount of solid removal was achieved i e 97 of ss removal when ferric chloride was used as a coagulant and a further load of the pollutant was decreased to the biological treatment clearly reveal that iron salts are more efficient than aluminum ones resulting in sufficient cod reductions up to 50 whereas the corresponding values in ca oh 2 and feso4 7h2o using bioflocculant rhizomonas obtained cod removal was 40 at a dosage of 0 02 g l 69 70 reported a 39 of cod were removed using fecl3 in recent works 47 of cod reduction has been attained with feso4 7h2o at a dosage of 12 g l 71 this indicates that feso4 7h2o presents less cod removal with ph values close to neutrality on the other hand when the ph value fluctuates between 8 and 10 the cod removal is reduced because the fe3 cations stabilize the colloidal particles by allowing them to be positively charged 72 however combining coagulants 73 or adding flocculants along with coagulants may improve floc settling rate 74 and hence process performance cod reduction up to 50 however there are certain drawbacks to this treatment including a steady sludge volume and an increase in the content of aluminum or iron in the liquid phase comparison between different coagulants and their removal efficiency among organic parameters were shown in table 3 3 4 anaerobic system startup and acclimatization the total startup time was 36 weeks at a room temperature of 15 40 c the upflow anaerobic filter setup was a single reactor attached biofilm system plastic pall rings were used as a surface for the growth of biofilm were chosen as they have a specific area and large porosity to attach a large quantity of microorganisms as a result it allows high strength leachate treatment with a high concentration load with significant production efficiency above a minimum of about 2 m reactor height seems to have little effect on performance 59 this study s reactor has a height of 6 ft 1 897 m designed to investigate the filter s performance the relative height of the medium within the reactor is a more significant parameter too little media appears to allow the excessive loss of solids and reduce cod removal 75 plastic media is more efficient than other media in wastewater treatment allowing good microbial growth due to high specific surface area and low molecular weight 3 4 1 ph variation and cod reduction during the acclimatization process of up flow anaerobic filter packed with plastic media after pretreatment the initial ph of high strength leachate was 5 1 highly acidic the leachate cod is 21 320 mg l and the bod is 14 070 mg l the bod cod ratio had 0 64 after pretreatment leachate s high strength has been given as continuous feed to the anaerobic filter for 60 days in a conventional manner the cod reduction and ph are shown in fig 4 when treating influent cod the filter performance packed with plastic media is 23 300 mg l and operating hrt at 5 days however the cod reduction from its initial value of 23 300 mg l to 17 856 mg l was observed at an hrt of 5 days the overall efficiency for cod removal was 23 3 only 23 3 cod removal was obtained at a high loading rate of 5 kg cod m3 d a related study indicated that 27 7 was achieved with an olr of 6 kg cod m3 d 38 throughout the startup phase ph was not controlled influent and effluent ph variations were shown in fig 8 during the startup period the results of ph effluent changes from 5 1 to 4 90 for studied olr which also indicated an accumulation of volatile fatty acids the study results show that anaerobic filters are capable of treating acidic waste with a ph of 5 in agreement with another report leachate s anaerobic treatment with low ph was performed but raw leachate was diluted with water 41 51 demonstrated that an anaerobic filter could reduce the cod mature landfill by 90 at loading rates varying from 1 26 to 1 45 kg cod m 3 day 1 the specific surface area random packing of plastic media provided better performance even though filter performance was not high which could be attributed to the high leachate concentration and low ph a long retention time of 5 days was used to allow the biomass to populate and attach to the medium while preventing biomass washout 3 4 2 treatment phase of high strength pretreated leachate the high strength leachate from reactor2 has a wet 73 and dry 27 waste composition simulated with rainfall the pretreatment has given to the leachate before using further tr obtaining an optimum dosage of 50 mg l and ph 8 2 the initial cod of l2 ranged from 44 000 mg l to 48 000 mg l optimum dosage and ph were used to treat leachate then fed to the anaerobic filter packed with plastic media the anaerobic filter effluent characteristics with different hydraulic loading rates hrt as shown in table 4 different hrts have been examined to check the performance of the anaerobic filter packed with plastic media the initial ph was 6 59 and the influent cod was 32 651 mg l and decreased to 28 632 mg l the efficiency was 12 31 and gradually increased to 20 03 as ph increased to 8 02 it indicates that ph and hrt are also significant factors in anaerobic filter performance at 5 days hrt the average influent cod concentrations were 32 651 to 28 975 mg l and effluent cod concentrations ranged from 28 632 23 170 mg l removal efficiencies were ranged from 12 31 to 20 03 at 4 days hrt cod concentrations were ranged from 30 765 mg l to 29 100 and removal efficiency was 13 7 to 15 46 therefore a 20 reduction in cod removal efficiency was observed at 5 days hrt when compared with 4 days hrt only a 15 46 reduction in cod removal was observed 4 conclusions significant conclusions were drawn from the current work it has been shown that anaerobic filters with high loading rates and highly acidic leachate can be treated but the desired effluent quality is difficult to achieve because of a high amount of organics in influent leachate it could be concluded that the combined treatment of leachate coagulation flocculation and anaerobic filter has given promising results for the treatment of high strength leachate and a further improvement in treatment efficiency may be necessary with the addition of microbial source for the growth of biomass i coagulation flocculation studies conducted on high strength landfill leachate from simulated landfill reactor indicated that fecl3 could remove suspended solids 97 3 and cod 55 4 at a low dosage at ph 5 which is a better performance as compared to other coagulants like alum fe so 4 7h2o bentonite clay ii fecl3 proved as the best coagulant among other coagulants for treating fresh leachates where a high amount of inorganic and organic colloids were present the study proves that the high amount of cod present in the leachate was particulate cod colloid residual matter based on the cod removal by the cfs iii the addition of fecl3 resulted in the formation of precipitates by raising the dose resulting in a high quantity of ss formed in the effluent and filter influent this could contribute to the anaerobic filter s low performance due to inorganics buildup in the filter medium therefore the research discussed the important factors affecting the relationship between the two stages of coagulation flocculation and anaerobic filter treatment iv through physicochemical treatment the cod value reached 32 100 mg l finally after anaerobic filter treatment cod of 23 170 mg l was obtained cod removal was 35 in coagulation treatment 20 03 in the anaerobic filter and overall removal was 51 52 including both phases the fecl3 appears to be a promising option for the pretreatment of biological techniques and removing colloidal particles and organic macromolecules however anaerobic filters are capable of treating acidic ph when combined with pretreatment v the strength and chemical composition of leachate varied with sampling time the high bod to cod ratio of raw leachate is sensitive to biological treatment a combined treatment system has been established to minimize the solids content from the raw leachate itself using the coagulation flocculation process combined with anaerobic filters as a second stage treatment

13102,with the increasing utilization of biochar bc various modification methods have been developed the evaluation of the environmental impact of modified bc is insufficient in this study three types of bc rice husk wood chip and mixture were modified through five different methods oxidation acidification alkalinization and impregnation of mnox and feox and the quantitative and qualitative characteristics of modified bc derived from dissolved organic matter dom were evaluated quantitative analysis revealed that the yield of dissolved organic carbon doc derived from modified bc was significantly lower than from bcraw suggesting that dom derived from bc was reduced following the modification of bc in wood bc the doc yield was different from that of other types of bc confirming that the quantitative characteristics of released doc from modified bc depend on its type dom derived from bcoxidic bcalkaline and bcmnox was characterized by highly condensed aromatic humic like substances with high trihalomethane and haloacetic acid formation potential in contrast dom from bcacidic and bcfeox showed a low degree of humification and disinfection by product formation potential suggesting that the qualitative properties and environmental impact of bc derived dom differ depending on the modification method overall our findings extend our understanding of environmental impact

with a limited oxygen supply 1 3 bc has received considerable attention concerning its applicability as a soil amendment in agriculture and as an adsorbent for contaminated soil remediation and water treatment because of its large surface area high porosity and negatively charged surface with high charge density 2 4 6 thus for the purpose of water treatment many studies have investigated the removal of heavy metals and contaminants using bc 7 9 recently various bc modification methods have been proposed along with different feedstock and pyrolysis conditions to increase the efficiency of removing contaminants from bc 10 11 activation methods such as acidic and alkaline treatment as well as an impregnation method by coating a metal oxide on the surface of a bc are already in use 6 12 despite these efforts to improve the removal efficiency of bc there are many restrictions on applying bc in water treatments many recent reviews have indicated that the environmental impact of bc is a major concern however studies on the environmental impact of bc are still considered to be insufficient 6 7 12 soudek et al 13 were concerned that bc has occasionally been shown to contain toxic compounds despite its effectiveness in environmental applications shim et al 14 demonstrated that activated bc can induce toxicity in daphnia magna and huang et al 15 reported that dissolved organic matter dom from bc could create toxic complexes with heavy metals suggesting that dom from bc may act as a hazardous substance in water systems in accordance with the unproven stability and environmental risks of bc more studies on bc are required to further illustrate its actual effect on the environment previous studies have reported that bc derived dom has different characteristics depending on the bc feedstock pyrolysis conditions and extraction methods 7 16 18 lee et al 3 reported that plant based bcs yielded a higher amount of leached dissolved organic carbon doc and the initial leaching is important during intermittent rain events yang et al 19 found that a high temperature of pyrolysis could decompose polyphenolic compounds and other aromatic structures in bc further increasing the release of humic like substances it has also been confirmed that the total organic carbon toc level of bc derived dom decreases with increasing pyrolysis temperature whereas the relative levels of fulvic acid like and polyphenolic pyrolysis products increase with the temperature 2 16 20 using nmr analysis liu et al 21 found that bc derived dom had abundant aliphatic carbon carboxyl carbon and small fused ring aromatics however despite these findings from previous studies no study has reported the differences in the characteristics of dom derived from modified bc through different modification methods as reported by cheng et al 7 secondary pollution caused by modified bc is a key issue that must be urgently resolved consequently the characteristics of dom that vary depending on the modification methods warrant further investigation furthermore the dom released from bcs used in soil amendment and water treatment has been recognized as a potential precursor of disinfection by products dbp because it could flow into drinking water resources 3 therefore investigation of the dbp formation potential fp of modified bc would also be very useful in the practical application of bc in the environment in the present study to compare the quantitative and qualitative properties of released dom derived from various bc types altered through various modification methods three different types of bcs rice husk wood chips and mixture were altered using five modification methods acidic alkaline oxidic mn and fe embedding in addition we investigated the relationship between the released dom and dbpfp of each modified bc to evaluate how dom released from modified bc affects the environment 2 materials and methods 2 1 bc preparation and dom extraction three types of commercially used bc were used in this study bc based on rice husk rice bc y co ltd south korea bc based on wood chips wood bc k co ltd south korea and bc based on a mixture mixed bc s co ltd south korea the mixed bc consisted of wood chips 70 dolomite 10 treacle 10 zeolite 5 and peat 5 although commercial bcs are manufactured under different conditions depending on the product all the bcs used in this study were produced in the temperature range of 300 400 c where the difference in the properties of bcs based on the pyrolysis temperature was relatively small 17 20 the purchased bc was prepared by removing impurities washing with deionized water d w and drying at 80 c for 24 h 6 the prepared raw bc bcraw was modified through the five modification methods that were mentioned the most in previous studies 6 7 bcraw was activated by soaking in a solution of 1 m hcl bcacidic 1 m naoh bcalkaline and 10 h2o2 bcoxidic at a solid liquid ratio of 30 g l with stirring at 150 rpm for 24 h 22 the bcs impregnated with mn and fe were prepared by mixing bcraw with a solution of 1 m kmno4 bcmnox and 1 m fecl3 bcfeox respectively at a solid liquid ratio of 30 g l next 200 ml each of 2 m hcl and 2 m naoh were added to form manganese oxide and iron hydroxide on the surface of bcmnox and bcfeox respectively 23 24 more details on the modification conditions are presented in fig 1 the modified bcs were then neutralized with hcl and naoh and washed with three times the volume of d w because the residual acids and bases could cause extreme changes in the ph of the leaching solution 23 24 leaching solutions for the dom extraction experiment were prepared by immersing each modified bc sample in the d w at a solid liquid ratio of 1 g l the initial ph of the leaching solution ranged from 6 to 8 and the extraction was conducted by stirring the solution samples at 150 rpm and 25 c for 24 h 17 following dom extraction the solution was filtered using a 0 45 μm membrane filter all experiments were conducted in triplicate 2 2 analytical measurements the contents of organic matter and metals in each modified bc sample were analyzed by using an elemental analyzer vario macro cube elementar germany and an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer icp ms icap q thermo scientific usa respectively fe and mn ions in the modified bc samples were dissolved via ultrasonic acid dissolution mars 6 cem co using 100 ml of an acid solution prepared by adding 5 ml each of hno3 hcl hf and aqua regia followed by digestion under microwave irradiation at 210 c for 60 min the extracted doc concentrations were determined using a toc analyzer toc l shimadzu japan the concentrations of leached mn and fe which were impregnated onto the modified bc surfaces were evaluated using an icp ms the results of absorption spectra ranged from 200 to 900 nm were obtained using a uv visible spectrophotometer 2120uv optizen south korea the fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem was measured using a spectrofluorometer f 7100 hitachi japan the wavelengths of excitation were set from 250 to 500 nm with scan steps of 5 nm and that of emission ranged from 280 to 550 nm with scan steps of 1 nm the specific uv absorbance values at 254 nm suva254 were calculated by dividing the absorbance at 254 nm by the concentration of doc 25 the humification index hix was determined by dividing the emission spectra over 435 480 nm at an excitation wavelength of 254 nm by that over 300 345 nm 26 the fluorescence index fi and biological index bix were estimated using the ratio of emission intensities at 450 500 nm with a fixed excitation wavelength of 370 nm 27 and that of the emission intensities at 380 430 nm at an excitation wavelength of 310 nm 28 respectively the obtained eems were normalized using the raman integrated area as described in the previous research 29 parafac modeling was performed on the eems of samples from all modified bcs using the dreem toolbox 29 in matlab r2018a mathworks natick ma usa the obtained components exhibited maximum fluorescence intensities fmax expressed as raman units 29 parafac modeling was conducted based on 180 eem data points detailed information about the parafac analysis of the eem spectra can be found in the article written by murphy et al 29 2 3 dbpfp experiments the solutions for specific dbpfp tests were diluted to 1 mg c l and chlorination was achieved by adding sodium hypochlorite naocl 4 available chlorine sigma aldrich usa at 5 mg cl2 mg of c the chlorinated solution was quickly sealed without any headspace and incubated at 25 c for 24 h 3 the specific dbpfp was defined as comprising three trihalomethane thm species chloroform bromodichloromethane and dibromochloromethane and two halo acetic acid haa species dichloroacetic acid and trichloroacetic acid formed upon chlorination 30 the purge and trap method purging for 11 min and desorption at 200 c for 2 min was used to obtain high concentrations of thms which were then analyzed using a gas chromatography mass spectrometer gc ms 7890b 5977a agilent usa the concentrations of haas were evaluated by a gas chromatography electron capture detector gc ecd cp 3800 bruker germany detailed operating conditions are listed in table s1 2 4 statistical analysis statistical analyses were conducted using the rstudio software paired t tests pearson correlation and principal component analysis pca were performed all data followed a normal distribution to verify the differences between the modification methods and correlation between each variable the statistical results were determined by setting the significance level at 0 05 for the paired t tests α 0 05 and 0 01 for correlation analysis α 0 01 to check the suitability of the pca 16 bartlett s and kaiser meyer olkin kmo tests were conducted which confirmed that varimax rotated pca could be performed on the data obtained in the present study kmo p 0 53 bartlett s p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 amount of bc derived dom depending on the bc type and modification method the doc yield from modified bc was significantly decreased or sustained compared with that from bcraw except for the yield from some modified wood bc fig 2 the doc yield of bcraw was higher for mixed bc 37 03 mg c g bc than for wood bc 5 63 mg c g bc followed by rice bc 3 04 mg c g bc suggesting that mixed bcraw contained a relatively high amount of soluble organic matter despite it having the lowest carbon content table s2 the doc yield of modified mixed bc was greatly reduced compared with that of mixed bcraw however there was no significant difference between the modification methods 3 01 3 95 mg c g bc considering that the impurities on the surface of bc such as non pyrolyzed organic matter and mineral ash are generally removed during the modification process 12 these results suggest that the modification of bc can reduce its environmental impact by decreasing the amount of carbon based soluble impurities otherwise environmental impact reduction can be achieved by promoting bc condensation resulting in a decrease in the release amount of dom similarly previous studies have reported that the change in the carbon structure of bc which occurs because of high pyrolysis temperature reduces the amount of dom generated 17 18 moreover the doc yield of modified rice bc showed no significant difference from that of rice bcraw except for that of rice bcacidic 2 52 mg c g bc and the doc yield of both wood bcoxidic and wood bcalkaline 7 62 8 39 mg c g bc was found to be significantly higher than that of wood bcraw the increase in doc yield is considered to be related to the structural destruction or increase in the levels of water soluble functional groups on the bc surface during the modification process 31 33 with regard to this lee et al 34 observed the formation of numerous cracks on the surface of wood based bc derived using the alkaline modification method and mentioned that this method could increase its surface area these results were consistent with the difference in dom production based on the bc type shown in previous studies 17 18 and the results of this study confirmed that the change in the amount of dom generated from bc was more dependent on the bc type than on the modification method the organic matter content in modified bc increased substantially after activation i e bcacidic bcoxidic and bcalkaline especially with the increase in carbon content table s2 the carbon content of activated bc was in the range of 49 23 71 42 but that of impregnated bc i e bcfeox bcmnox was lower owing to the increase in the amount of metal used for modification the contents of fe and mn in bcfeox and bcmnox ranged from 5 82 to 36 50 and 19 54 to 38 47 respectively showing that the contents of fe and mn were the highest in mixed bc moreover the percentage of released doc which was calculated based on the carbon content of bc ranged from 0 45 to 1 66 except for that of mixed bcraw 7 52 showing a similar value regardless of modification method 2 18 considering that approximately half of the amount of dom released from bc is initially produced within less than 1 day 3 a large amount of dom was not released from the modified bc the dissolved fe and mn yield μg g bc from the modified bc was the highest at 409 79 μg fe g bc in wood bcfeox and 2800 36 μg mn g bc in rice bcmnox fig 2 a showing that the dissolved yield of the corresponding metal increased with the impregnation of the metal onto the bc the fe and mn release rates ranged from 0 00 to 0 70 and 0 00 to 1 43 respectively except for those in mixed bcraw fe 2 26 mn 3 40 consequently there was a difference in the yield of bc derived dom and that of metal ions depending on the type and the percentage of released doc and metals was low 3 2 spectroscopic characteristics of bc derived dom depending on the bc type and modification method the spectroscopic indicators of bc derived dom are listed in table 1 based on the bc type and modification method the spectroscopic characteristics of bc derived dom showed significant differences according to the type and modification method used the suva254 value of bcraw was in the order of mixed bc 1 77 wood bc 1 17 rice bc 0 48 and that of modified bc showed a general increasing tendency compared with that of bcraw these results were similar to those of previous studies showing that dom from agricultural residue bc had higher levels of aromatic like components than that from wood pig manure and sewage sludge bc 17 in particular the suva254 value of bcmnox increased regardless of the bc type suggesting that the aromaticity of dom derived from bc is greatly increased during the mnox impregnation process the e2 e3 ratio was also increased after bc modification and that of bcmnox was increased in all bc types considering that the e2 e3 ratio has a negative relationship with the molecular weight of dom 35 the molecular weight of dom derived from bc was reduced by the modification despite its high aromaticity the low molecular weight of bcmnox derived dom may suggest that the condensation degree of these aromatic structures is high 3 18 in this regard the bc types can be arranged according to their hix which indicates the degree of dom humification from highest to lowest as mixed bc 8 21 rice bc 1 11 wood bc 0 95 and significantly higher values were exhibited in bcoxidic 2 71 9 81 bcalkaline 1 06 10 20 and bcmnox 4 24 13 70 regardless of the bc type in addition both fi and bix showed the opposite trends to that of hix showing low values in bcoxidic fi 0 84 1 15 bix 0 29 0 52 bcalkaline fi 0 97 1 25 bix 0 43 0 81 and bcmnox fi 0 74 1 04 bix 0 26 0 43 dom derived from bcacidic and bcfeox showed relatively low hix and high fi and bix values which contrast with the results obtained from other modification methods because the bc was exposed to harsh acidic conditions ph 2 during the modifications we determined that there were differences in the dom transformation processes or the amount of impurity removed from the bc surface this finding suggests that the dom derived from modified bc especially in bcoxidic bcalkaline and bcmnox could be characterized as a highly condensed aromatic structure with less biological microbial contribution to investigate more spectral characteristics all dom derived from bc was decomposed into two main fluorescent components c1 and c2 by parafac modeling fig 3 the two main components were assigned based on previous literature 2 3 18 and classified as one humic like c1 and one protein like component c2 c1 and c2 had fluorescence maxima at excitation emission wavelengths of 250 315 nm 475 nm and 250 285 nm 325 nm respectively c1 displayed a combination of widespread peaks a and c appearing as terrestrial or ubiquitous humic like substances 3 36 38 in previous studies this component was frequently found in bc derived dom 2 3 and has been suggested to be mainly related to pyrolysis products with aromatic and poly phenolic structures similar to aromatic humic like substances 39 c2 was located in peak b which is a typical feature of tyrosine like substances this component has also been found in bc extracts in previous studies especially in bcs generated from lignin rich feedstock such as sludge 3 39 the fmax values of both c1 and c2 from the bcraw derived dom were relatively high in mixed bc but in wood bc the value of c1 0 795 was relatively higher than that of c2 0 047 fig 4 which can be attributed to the high lignin content in the wood feedstock these results were contradictory to those of previous studies which reported that the protein like tannin like component was more abundant in woody plant bc than in other types of bc 40 and this difference suggested that bc of the same woody type could show conflicting results depending on the feedstock and manufacturing process the changes in fmax of c1 and that of c2 also showed different patterns depending on the modification method as shown above the comparison of the fmax of c1 to that of c2 of each modified bc showed that dom derived from bcoxidic bcalkaline and bcmnox was significantly higher in c1 than in c2 and this changing pattern was particularly prominent in rice bc meanwhile dom derived from bcacidic and bcfeox exhibited a higher increase in c2 than in c1 or a reduction in c1 compared with the c1 of dom derived from bcraw regardless of the bc type with regard to this ahmed et al 22 reported that high levels of oxygenated functional groups are generated under acidic conditions whereas high ratios of surface aromaticity are produced under alkaline conditions furthermore this aspect can be confirmed more clearly by comparing the c1 c2 ratio among bcacidic 0 69 5 43 bcoxidic 4 78 43 95 bcalkaline 1 00 9 77 bcfeox 0 31 0 92 and bcmnox 3 82 134 68 table 1 interestingly the c1 c2 ratio showed the most significant difference in the modified bc impregnated with metals i e bcfeox and bcmnox the fluorescence c1 was considerably decreased in the feox coated bc while it was considerably increased in the mnox coated bc the dissolved fe iii could preferentially form a complex with humic like substances and manganese oxide could contribute to the formation of a more aromatic material through catalytic reactions such as cross coupling thus this marked change might be attributed to a secondary reaction between the released dom and metal of the modified bc interestingly zhang et al 41 reported that fe ions could form markedly strong complexes with aromatic organic acid compounds and lee et al 42 found that phenol and aniline based aromatic compounds promoted the humification process through oxidation covalent reaction mediated by manganese oxide 3 3 specific dbpfp of bc derived dom depending on bc type and modification method to evaluate the environmental impact of bc derived dom based on the modification method used the specific dbpfp was measured and the results of specific thmfp and haafp yield μg g bc are presented in fig 5 among the measured specific thm and haa species chloroform and dichloroacetic acid were the predominant species in all dom samples the specific thmfp and haafp yield of bcraw was the highest from mixed bcraw 863 54 μg g bc and 865 39 μg g bc respectively followed by wood bcraw 219 29 μg g bc and 157 75 μg g bc respectively and rice bcraw 62 02 μg g bc and 55 02 μg g bc respectively in the present study the yield of mixed bcraw was extremely high it was approximately 10 times higher than the annual average maximum contaminant level of disinfected drinking water regulated by the u s environmental protection agency usepa 80 μg l and 60 μg l for thms and haas suggesting that there is a need for further treatment to reduce the precursors of specific thms and haas moreover both the specific thmfp and haafp of bc derived dom were significantly decreased in mixed bc produced by all modification methods specific thmfp 57 31 101 67 μg g bc specific haafp 36 33 93 16 μg g bc however in rice and wood bc they were significantly increased by oxidic alkaline and mnox modification methods compared with those in bcraw in addition the specific thmfp and haafp of dom derived from bcacidic and bcfeox was the lowest among the modification methods regardless of bc type there was no significant difference between specific thmfp and haafp among the modification methods as confirmed before specific dbpfp showed a changing pattern similar to the patterns of the hix and fmax of c1 suggesting that specific dbpfp could be closely related to the highly condensed aromatic humic like substances similarly lee et al 3 reported that condensed aromatic structures could act as surrogates for thm formation in bc derived dom these results indicate that the characteristics of specific dbp precursors derived from bc could change depending on the modification method therefore the modification method should be considered for reducing the environmental impact of bc 3 4 relationship between bc derived dom and specific dbpfp pearson correlation analysis was conducted to confirm the relationship between bc derived dom and specific dbpfp significant correlations between the spectroscopic characteristics of bc derived dom and those of specific dbpfp were observed for suva254 e2 e3 ratio and fmax of c1 table s3 the correlation coefficients with specific thmfp and haafp were 0 61 and 0 56 p 0 01 for suva254 0 59 and 0 63 p 0 01 for e2 e3 ratio and 0 46 and 0 50 p 0 01 for c1 respectively confirming that the aromaticity of dom and humic like substances are related to dbp production in contrast indicators derived based on the fluorescence results i e hix fi and bix showed a low correlation with specific dbpfp despite their high correlation with c1 0 85 for hix 0 57 for fi and 0 62 for bix p 0 01 in general the humification degree of dom in rivers and lakes is known to have a high correlation with specific dbp generation but in the case of dom derived from bc it has been reported that the correlation between spectral indicators and specific dbpfp is low 34 lee et al 3 reported that a systematic investigation of various feedstocks and production conditions is necessary to confirm this inconsistent trend we also confirmed that the dom precursor for specific dbp production is strongly affected by the modification method therefore evaluation of the main characteristics of bc derived dom depending on the feedstock production conditions and even modification methods has important implications for predicting and managing dbp generation in terms of raw water management to obtain further insight into the relationship between bc derived dom and specific dbpfp depending on the modification method the pca trend was evaluated fig 6 pca was performed using the entire dataset and two principal factors were determined which explained 28 0 rc1 and 26 8 rc2 of the total variance in the dataset rc1 was explained by aromatic dbp precursors as being positively correlated with suva254 e2 e3 ratio c1 c2 ratio specific thmfp and specific haafp and negatively correlated with c2 rc2 represented the labile fraction of dom because it showed a positive correlation with hix and c1 and a negative correlation with fi and bix based on these principal factors it was clear that the bc derived dom contained more dbp precursors with a relatively condensed aromatic structure when it was located on the upper right side of fig 6 overall the location of bcraw differed according to the bc type but the changing pattern according to the modification method was similar regardless of the bc type on the one hand dom derived from bcoxidic bcalkaline and bcmnox was more condensed than that derived from bcraw and a larger amount of dbp precursors was produced as the properties of dom shifted toward the upper right side of fig 6 after modifications on the other hand we determined that the dom derived from bcacidic and bcfeox moved in opposite directions to lower the environmental impact of bc in summary the environmental impact of bc differed because of the differences in the bc derived dom yield and its spectroscopic characteristics according to the modification method but the changes owing to modification were not significantly dependent on the bc type consequently it was confirmed that the bc type with low dom yield and modification method with low aromaticity should be selected according to the application of bc to minimize the secondary environmental impact of bc 4 conclusions in this study the quantitative and qualitative characteristics of modified bc derived dom were investigated according to three types of bc and five different modification methods and the environmental impact was also evaluated based on the dbpfp the yield of modified bc derived dom was generally decreased after modifications especially for mixed bc however in wood bc the yield of modified bc derived dom was increased in bcoxidic and bcalkaline owing to the structural change in the bc surface thus it was confirmed that the quantitative characteristics of dom were more dependent on the bc type than on the modification method the spectroscopic characteristics of the bcs varied depending on the modification method the dom derived from bcoxidic bcalkaline and bcmnox showed high hix and c1 c2 ratio suggesting that these modification methods increased the dbp precursor levels of a highly concentrated aromatic humic like component in contrast the dom derived from bcacidic and bcfeox showed the opposite trend with a decrease in dbpfp this trend appeared consistently irrespective of the bc type in conclusion the type of bc affects the quantitative characteristics of dom derived from modified bc and the modification method is highly likely to affect the qualitative characteristics generally bc derived dom plays a crucial role in the mobility and toxicity of pollutants through the interaction of bcs with contaminants therefore to utilize modified bc for water treatment an appropriate bc type and modification method should be selected in consideration of the dom yield and the characteristics of modified bc derived dom in addition to these advances our findings can provide a comprehensive understanding and insights into the effects of modified bc derived dom on water systems declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

bc was prepared by removing impurities washing with deionized water d w and drying at 80 c for 24 h 6 the prepared raw bc bcraw was modified through the five modification methods that were mentioned the most in previous studies 6 7 bcraw was activated by soaking in a solution of 1 m hcl bcacidic 1 m naoh bcalkaline and 10 h2o2 bcoxidic at a solid liquid ratio of 30 g l with stirring at 150 rpm for 24 h 22 the bcs impregnated with mn and fe were prepared by mixing bcraw with a solution of 1 m kmno4 bcmnox and 1 m fecl3 bcfeox respectively at a solid liquid ratio of 30 g l next 200 ml each of 2 m hcl and 2 m naoh were added to form manganese oxide and iron hydroxide on the surface of bcmnox and bcfeox respectively 23 24 more details on the modification conditions are presented in fig 1 the modified bcs were then neutralized with hcl and naoh and washed with three times the volume of d w because the residual acids and bases could cause extreme changes in the ph of the leaching solution 23 24 leaching solutions for the dom extraction experiment were prepared by immersing each modified bc sample in the d w at a solid liquid ratio of 1 g l the initial ph of the leaching solution ranged from 6 to 8 and the extraction was conducted by stirring the solution samples at 150 rpm and 25 c for 24 h 17 following dom extraction the solution was filtered using a 0 45 μm membrane filter all experiments were conducted in triplicate 2 2 analytical measurements the contents of organic matter and metals in each modified bc sample were analyzed by using an elemental analyzer vario macro cube elementar germany and an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer icp ms icap q thermo scientific usa respectively fe and mn ions in the modified bc samples were dissolved via ultrasonic acid dissolution mars 6 cem co using 100 ml of an acid solution prepared by adding 5 ml each of hno3 hcl hf and aqua regia followed by digestion under microwave irradiation at 210 c for 60 min the extracted doc concentrations were determined using a toc analyzer toc l shimadzu japan the concentrations of leached mn and fe which were impregnated onto the modified bc surfaces were evaluated using an icp ms the results of absorption spectra ranged from 200 to 900 nm were obtained using a uv visible spectrophotometer 2120uv optizen south korea the fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem was measured using a spectrofluorometer f 7100 hitachi japan the wavelengths of excitation were set from 250 to 500 nm with scan steps of 5 nm and that of emission ranged from 280 to 550 nm with scan steps of 1 nm the specific uv absorbance values at 254 nm suva254 were calculated by dividing the absorbance at 254 nm by the concentration of doc 25 the humification index hix was determined by dividing the emission spectra over 435 480 nm at an excitation wavelength of 254 nm by that over 300 345 nm 26 the fluorescence index fi and biological index bix were estimated using the ratio of emission intensities at 450 500 nm with a fixed excitation wavelength of 370 nm 27 and that of the emission intensities at 380 430 nm at an excitation wavelength of 310 nm 28 respectively the obtained eems were normalized using the raman integrated area as described in the previous research 29 parafac modeling was performed on the eems of samples from all modified bcs using the dreem toolbox 29 in matlab r2018a mathworks natick ma usa the obtained components exhibited maximum fluorescence intensities fmax expressed as raman units 29 parafac modeling was conducted based on 180 eem data points detailed information about the parafac analysis of the eem spectra can be found in the article written by murphy et al 29 2 3 dbpfp experiments the solutions for specific dbpfp tests were diluted to 1 mg c l and chlorination was achieved by adding sodium hypochlorite naocl 4 available chlorine sigma aldrich usa at 5 mg cl2 mg of c the chlorinated solution was quickly sealed without any headspace and incubated at 25 c for 24 h 3 the specific dbpfp was defined as comprising three trihalomethane thm species chloroform bromodichloromethane and dibromochloromethane and two halo acetic acid haa species dichloroacetic acid and trichloroacetic acid formed upon chlorination 30 the purge and trap method purging for 11 min and desorption at 200 c for 2 min was used to obtain high concentrations of thms which were then analyzed using a gas chromatography mass spectrometer gc ms 7890b 5977a agilent usa the concentrations of haas were evaluated by a gas chromatography electron capture detector gc ecd cp 3800 bruker germany detailed operating conditions are listed in table s1 2 4 statistical analysis statistical analyses were conducted using the rstudio software paired t tests pearson correlation and principal component analysis pca were performed all data followed a normal distribution to verify the differences between the modification methods and correlation between each variable

s and kaiser meyer olkin kmo tests were conducted which confirmed that varimax rotated pca could be performed on the data obtained in the present study kmo p 0 53 bartlett s p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 amount of bc derived dom depending on the bc type and modification method the doc yield from modified bc was significantly decreased or sustained compared with that from bcraw except for the yield from some modified wood bc fig 2 the doc yield of bcraw was higher for mixed bc 37 03 mg c g bc than for wood bc 5 63 mg c g bc followed by rice bc 3 04 mg c g bc suggesting that mixed bcraw contained a relatively high amount of soluble organic matter despite it having the lowest carbon content table s2 the doc yield of modified mixed bc was greatly reduced compared with that of mixed bcraw however there was no significant difference between the modification methods 3 01 3 95 mg c g bc considering that the impurities on the surface of bc such as non pyrolyzed organic matter and mineral ash are generally removed during the modification process 12 these results suggest that the modification of bc can reduce its environmental impact by decreasing the amount of carbon based soluble impurities otherwise environmental impact reduction can be achieved by promoting bc condensation resulting in a decrease in the release amount of dom similarly previous studies have reported that the change in the carbon structure of bc which occurs because of high pyrolysis temperature reduces the amount of dom generated 17 18 moreover the doc yield of modified rice bc showed no significant difference from that of rice bcraw except for that of rice bcacidic 2 52 mg c g bc and the doc yield of both wood bcoxidic and wood bcalkaline 7 62 8 39 mg c g bc was found to be significantly higher than that of wood bcraw the increase in doc yield is considered to be related to the structural destruction or increase in the levels of water soluble functional groups on the bc surface during the modification process 31 33 with regard to this lee et al 34 observed the formation of numerous cracks on the surface of wood based bc derived using the alkaline modification method and mentioned that this method could increase its surface area these results were consistent with the difference in dom production based on the bc type shown in previous studies 17 18 and the results of this study confirmed that the change in the amount of dom generated from bc was more dependent on the bc type than on the modification method the organic matter content in modified bc increased substantially after activation i e bcacidic bcoxidic and bcalkaline especially with the increase in carbon content table s2 the carbon content of activated bc was in the range of 49 23 71 42 but that of impregnated bc i e bcfeox bcmnox was lower owing to the increase in the amount of metal used for modification the contents of fe and mn in bcfeox and bcmnox ranged from 5 82 to 36 50 and 19 54 to 38 47 respectively showing that the contents of fe and mn were the highest in mixed bc moreover the percentage of released doc which was calculated based on the carbon content of bc ranged from 0 45 to 1 66 except for that of mixed bcraw 7 52 showing a similar value regardless of modification method 2 18 considering that approximately half of the amount of dom released from bc is initially produced within less than 1 day 3 a large amount of dom was not released from the modified bc the dissolved fe and mn yield μg g bc from the modified bc was the highest at 409 79 μg fe g bc in wood bcfeox and 2800 36 μg mn g bc in rice bcmnox fig 2 a showing that the dissolved yield of the corresponding metal increased with the impregnation of the metal onto the bc the fe and mn release rates ranged from 0 00 to 0 70 and 0 00 to 1 43 respectively except for those in mixed bcraw fe 2 26 mn 3 40 consequently there was a difference in the yield of bc derived dom and that of metal ions depending on the type and the percentage of released doc and metals was low 3 2 spectroscopic characteristics of bc derived dom depending on the bc type and modification method the spectroscopic indicators of bc derived dom are listed in table 1 based on the bc type and modification method the spectroscopic characteristics of bc derived dom showed significant differences according to the type and modification method used the suva254 value of bcraw was in the order of mixed bc 1 77 wood bc 1 17 rice bc 0 48 and that of modified bc showed a general increasing tendency compared with that of bcraw these results were similar to those of previous studies showing that dom from agricultural residue bc had higher levels of aromatic like components than that from wood pig manure and sewage sludge bc 17 in particular the suva254 value of bcmnox increased regardless of the bc type suggesting that the aromaticity of dom derived from bc is greatly increased during the mnox impregnation process the e2 e3 ratio was also increased after bc modification and that of bcmnox was increased in all bc types considering that the e2 e3 ratio has a negative relationship with the molecular weight of dom 35 the molecular weight of dom derived from bc was reduced by the modification despite its high aromaticity the low molecular weight of bcmnox derived dom may suggest that the condensation degree of these aromatic structures is high 3 18 in this regard the bc types can be arranged according to their hix which indicates the degree of dom humification from highest to lowest as mixed bc 8 21 rice bc 1 11 wood bc 0 95 and significantly higher values were exhibited in bcoxidic 2 71 9 81 bcalkaline 1 06 10 20 and bcmnox 4 24 13 70 regardless of the bc type in addition both fi and bix showed the opposite trends to that of hix showing low values in bcoxidic fi 0 84 1 15 bix 0 29 0 52 bcalkaline fi 0 97 1 25 bix 0 43 0 81 and bcmnox fi 0 74 1 04 bix 0 26 0 43 dom derived from bcacidic and bcfeox showed relatively low hix and high fi and bix values which contrast with the results obtained from other modification methods because the bc was exposed to harsh acidic conditions ph 2 during the modifications we determined that there were differences in the dom transformation processes or the amount of impurity removed from the bc surface this finding suggests that the dom derived from modified bc especially in bcoxidic bcalkaline and bcmnox could be characterized as a highly condensed aromatic structure with less biological microbial contribution to investigate more spectral characteristics all dom derived from bc was decomposed into two main fluorescent components c1 and c2 by parafac modeling fig 3 the two main components were assigned based on previous literature 2 3 18 and classified as one humic like c1 and one protein like component c2 c1 and c2 had fluorescence maxima at excitation emission wavelengths of 250 315 nm 475 nm and 250 285 nm 325 nm respectively c1 displayed a combination of widespread peaks a and c appearing as terrestrial or ubiquitous humic like substances 3 36 38 in previous studies this component was frequently found in bc derived dom 2 3 and has been suggested to be mainly related to pyrolysis products with aromatic and poly phenolic structures similar to aromatic humic like substances 39 c2 was located in peak b which is a typical feature of tyrosine like substances this component has also been found in bc extracts in previous studies especially in bcs generated from lignin rich feedstock such as sludge 3 39 the fmax values of both c1 and c2 from the bcraw derived dom were relatively high in mixed bc but in wood bc the value of c1 0 795 was relatively higher than that of c2 0 047 fig 4 which can be attributed to the high lignin content in the wood feedstock these results were contradictory to those of previous studies which reported that the protein like tannin like component was more abundant in woody plant bc than in other types of bc 40 and this difference suggested that bc of the same woody type could show conflicting results depending on the feedstock and manufacturing process the changes in fmax of c1 and that of c2 also showed different patterns depending on the modification method as shown above the comparison of the fmax of c1 to that of c2 of each modified bc showed that dom derived from bcoxidic bcalkaline and bcmnox was significantly higher in c1 than in c2 and this changing pattern was particularly prominent in rice bc meanwhile dom derived from bcacidic and bcfeox exhibited a higher increase in c2 than in c1 or a reduction in c1 compared with the c1 of dom derived from bcraw regardless of the bc type with regard to this ahmed et al 22 reported that high levels of oxygenated functional groups are generated under acidic conditions whereas high ratios of surface aromaticity are produced under alkaline conditions furthermore this aspect can be confirmed more clearly by comparing the c1 c2 ratio among bcacidic 0 69 5 43 bcoxidic 4 78 43 95 bcalkaline 1 00 9 77 bcfeox 0 31 0 92 and bcmnox 3 82 134 68 table 1 interestingly the c1 c2 ratio showed the most significant difference in the modified bc impregnated with metals i e bcfeox and bcmnox the fluorescence c1 was considerably decreased in the feox coated bc while it was considerably increased in the mnox coated bc the dissolved fe iii could preferentially form a complex with humic like substances and manganese oxide could contribute to the formation of a more aromatic material through catalytic reactions such as cross coupling thus this marked change might be attributed to a secondary reaction between the released dom and metal of the modified bc interestingly zhang et al 41 reported that fe ions could form markedly strong complexes with aromatic organic acid compounds and lee et al 42 found that phenol and aniline based aromatic compounds promoted the humification process through oxidation covalent reaction mediated by manganese oxide 3 3 specific dbpfp of bc derived dom depending on bc type and modification method to evaluate the environmental impact of bc derived dom based on the modification method used the specific dbpfp was measured and the results of specific thmfp and haafp yield μg g bc are presented in fig 5 among the measured specific thm and haa species chloroform and dichloroacetic acid were the predominant species in all dom samples the specific thmfp and haafp yield of bcraw was the highest from mixed bcraw 863 54 μg g bc and 865 39 μg g bc respectively followed by wood bcraw 219 29 μg g bc and 157 75 μg g bc respectively and rice bcraw 62 02 μg g bc and 55 02 μg g bc respectively in the present study the yield of mixed bcraw was extremely high it was approximately 10 times higher than the annual average maximum contaminant level of disinfected drinking water regulated by the u s environmental protection agency usepa 80 μg l and 60 μg l for thms and haas suggesting that there is a need for further treatment to reduce the precursors of specific thms and haas moreover both the specific thmfp and haafp of bc derived dom were significantly decreased in mixed bc produced by all modification methods specific thmfp 57 31 101 67 μg g bc specific haafp 36 33 93 16 μg g bc however in rice and wood bc they were significantly increased by oxidic alkaline and mnox modification methods compared with those in bcraw in addition the specific thmfp and haafp of dom derived from bcacidic and bcfeox was the lowest among the modification methods regardless of bc type there was no significant difference between specific thmfp and haafp among the modification methods as confirmed before specific dbpfp showed a changing pattern similar to the patterns of the hix and fmax of c1 suggesting that specific dbpfp could be closely related to the highly condensed aromatic humic like substances similarly lee et al 3 reported that condensed aromatic structures could act as surrogates for thm formation in bc derived dom these results indicate that the characteristics of specific dbp precursors derived from bc could change depending on the modification method therefore the modification method should be considered for reducing the environmental impact of bc 3 4 relationship between bc derived dom and specific dbpfp pearson correlation analysis was conducted to confirm the relationship between bc derived dom and specific dbpfp significant correlations between the spectroscopic characteristics of bc derived dom and those of specific dbpfp were observed for suva254 e2 e3 ratio and fmax of c1 table s3 the correlation coefficients with specific thmfp and haafp were 0 61 and 0 56 p 0 01 for suva254 0 59 and 0 63 p 0 01 for e2 e3 ratio and 0 46 and 0 50 p 0 01 for c1 respectively confirming that the aromaticity of dom and humic like substances are related to dbp production in contrast indicators derived based on the fluorescence results i e hix fi and bix showed a low correlation with specific dbpfp despite their high correlation with c1 0 85 for hix 0 57 for fi and 0 62 for bix p 0 01 in general the humification degree of dom in rivers and lakes is known to have a high correlation with specific dbp generation but in the case of dom derived from bc it has been reported that the correlation between spectral indicators and specific dbpfp is low 34 lee et al 3 reported that a systematic investigation of various feedstocks and production conditions is necessary to confirm this inconsistent trend we also confirmed that the dom precursor for specific dbp production is strongly affected by the modification method therefore evaluation of the main characteristics of bc derived dom depending on the feedstock production conditions and even modification methods has important implications for predicting and managing dbp generation in terms of raw water management to obtain further insight into the relationship between bc derived dom and specific dbpfp depending on the modification method the pca trend was evaluated fig 6 pca was performed using the entire dataset and two principal factors were determined which explained 28 0 rc1 and 26 8 rc2 of the total variance in the dataset rc1 was explained by aromatic dbp precursors as being positively correlated with suva254 e2 e3 ratio c1 c2 ratio specific thmfp and specific haafp and negatively correlated with c2 rc2 represented the labile fraction of dom because it showed a positive correlation with hix and c1 and a negative correlation with fi and bix based on these principal factors it was clear that the bc derived dom contained more dbp precursors with a relatively condensed aromatic structure when it was located on the upper right side of fig 6 overall the location of bcraw differed according to the bc type but the changing pattern according to the modification method was similar regardless of the bc type on the one hand dom derived from bcoxidic bcalkaline and bcmnox was more condensed than that derived from bcraw and a larger amount of dbp precursors was produced as the properties of dom shifted toward the upper right side of fig 6 after modifications on the other hand we determined that the dom derived from bcacidic and bcfeox moved in opposite directions to lower the environmental impact of bc in summary the environmental impact of bc differed because of the differences in the bc derived dom yield and its spectroscopic characteristics according to the modification method but the changes owing to modification were not significantly dependent on the bc type consequently it was confirmed that the bc type with low dom yield and modification method with low aromaticity should be selected according to the application of bc to minimize the secondary environmental impact of bc 4 conclusions in this study the quantitative and qualitative characteristics of modified bc derived dom were investigated according to three types of bc and five different modification methods and the environmental impact was also evaluated based on the dbpfp the yield of modified bc derived dom was generally decreased after modifications especially for mixed bc however in wood bc the yield of modified bc derived dom was increased in bcoxidic and bcalkaline owing to the structural change in the bc surface thus it was confirmed that the quantitative characteristics of dom were more dependent on the bc type than on the modification method the spectroscopic characteristics of the bcs varied depending on the modification method the dom derived from bcoxidic bcalkaline and bcmnox showed high hix and c1 c2 ratio suggesting that these modification methods increased the dbp precursor levels of a highly concentrated aromatic humic like component in contrast the dom derived from bcacidic and bcfeox showed the opposite trend with a decrease in dbpfp this trend appeared consistently irrespective of the bc type in conclusion the type of bc affects the quantitative characteristics of dom derived from modified bc and the modification method is highly likely to affect the qualitative characteristics generally bc derived dom plays a crucial role in the mobility and toxicity of pollutants through the interaction of bcs with contaminants therefore to utilize modified bc for water treatment an appropriate bc type and modification method should be selected in consideration of the dom yield and the characteristics of modified bc derived dom in addition to these advances our findings can provide a comprehensive understanding and insights into the effects of modified bc derived dom on water systems declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

13103,in biological wastewater treatment plants wwtps sludge thickening is a common problem with major economic and environmental effects monitoring the sludge volume index svi is a critical difficulty in sludge bulking quantification this study develops a hybrid deep learning based soft sensor that uses a sparse constraint stacked autoencoder sae model to estimate svi and classify bulking states in wwtp effluent to improve effluent quality the weights of the sae in a training plan were adjusted using an extreme learning machine elm technique a deep belief network technique was applied to the extracted feature space of the elm to classify the current state of a secondary clarifier the suggested methodology outperforms existing state of the art methods in the svi modeling task by 38 to 78 on the other hand the bulking state was properly classified with 90 7 accuracy and 91 precision graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords deep belief network extreme learning machine sludge bulking sludge volume index stacked autoencoder 1 introduction rapid population growth urbanization and industrialization focused on the need for clean water and improved wastewater treatment designs due to the limited water resources growing concerns about effluent quality requirements have put pressure on engineers to exploit real time monitoring technology and control biological wastewater treatment plants wwtps 1 47 although the activated sludge process asp is a typical biological technology employed in wwtps it is difficult to comprehend and regulate one of the essential phases in the asp is the secondary clarifier which separates activated sludge from treated effluent 2 poor effluent quality after the asp is usually caused by the secondary clarifier failing to remove suspended biomass from the treated water resulting in a condition known as sludge bulking 3 a soft or virtual sensor would allow the wwtp to be monitored sludge bulking to be avoided and plant control to be improved several recent studies have attempted to model the kinetic properties of filamentous bacteria in order to determine the cause of sludge bulking 4 image analysis was used by mesquita et al 2011 to provide morphological data and detect evidence of sludge bulking 5 wágner et al 6 presented a practical mathematical approach to modeling filamentous bulking based on computational fluid dynamics however because the process operators in a wwtp are dynamic it has proven difficult to capture the non linear dynamic behavior of the processes in a mathematical model in this context mechanistic methods for monitoring environmental systems have recently been outperformed by artificial intelligent techniques recognizing the benefits that accrue to a real time monitoring framework and resulting in a cost effective option for estimating hard to measure variables within the system 7 9 past investigations have been devoted to characterize the behavior and evolution of the sludge bulking phenomena for instance jenné et al 2007 described a fully automatic image analysis procedure that can reliably characterize activated sludge s flocculence and filament features 10 however because these methods operate offline and the prediction results rely on image quality none provide a definitive solution then machine learning techniques were introduced to amend these issues deepnarain et al 2019 proposed a decision tree model that identifies and predicts filamentous sludge bulking the model was studied as a function of organic loading and digital image analysis 12 mesquita et al 2016 combined partial least squares with image analysis to quantify the correlation between the settling ability of sludge and the results of image analysis 13 however due to the high non linearity of sludge bulking progression linear models often deviate significantly from the actual state early efforts on the non linearity issue in the sludge bulking holistic monitoring can be seen in the study of yoo et al 2002 who developed a model for svi prediction and sludge bulking classification using recursive least squares and neural networks 14 despite this progress implementing prediction models still takes a significant amount of time and effort especially in the present field of study 15 a model must capture the severe and non linear effects of operating factors on the ability of sludge to settle while sensing the noise in wwtps for the dynamic prediction of sludge bulking one potential method to compensate for the uncertainties in wwtps is to use neural networks with several hidden layers such as deep architectures 16 46 deep learning uses more non linear transformations than other approaches making it more effective at learning extremely non linear and varying functions 17 the emerging development of deep learning techniques has yielded impressive results when applied to vision language and chemometric datasets 18 in this context harrou et al 2018 applied an integrated deep belief network dbn to a one class support vector machine for fault detection monitoring in wwtps 19 ba alawi et al 2021 developed a novel semi supervised soft sensor model for the online prediction of multiple process variables in wwtps using a stacked autoencoder sae 21 however data driven models with multiple input layers may have unacceptably lengthy computational times this paper aims to overcome this problem utilizing extreme learning machines elms have made significant theoretical and applied contributions due to their rapid training time generalization abilities and universal classification ability 22 these elms have demonstrated excellent learning accuracy and speed in various applications such as face recognition 23 image segmentation 24 environmental dataset analysis 25 and human action recognition 26 the major goal of this article was to develop an innovative monitoring strategy to improve the operation and performance of wwtps deep learning techniques were utilized to create a soft sensor model capable of the following 1 modeling the evolution of the svi using an sae via training and stacking numerous layers of autoencoders 2 classifying the bulking state phenomenon in the secondary clarifier using a dbn 3 dealing with uncertainties and time constraints through combining sae with an extreme learning machine the suggested soft sensor model with uncertainty information was employed in a full scale wwtp to identify the bulking stage and control filamentous sludge bulking 2 materials and methods 2 1 full scale wastewater treatment process and data collection wastewater treatment involves non linear and dimensional interacting dynamics 27 large uncertainties 28 multivariable structures 29 and time varying inflow rates and pollutant concentrations 30 this study collected data from a biological wastewater treatment process at a steel and coke making plant in south korea a schematic diagram of the full scale activated sludge process is shown in fig 1 it consists of five aeration basins each 900 m3 a secondary clarifier 1200 m3 and two influent streams 14 one influent stream supplies wastewater directly from the coke making plant biological effluent treatment unit 3 bet 3 in contrast the other influent stream comprises pretreated wastewater from an upstream treatment plant at another coke making plant biological effluent treatment unit 2 bet 2 wastewater at a coke oven plant is produced during the conversion of coal to coke during steelmaking this wastewater is highly polluted and challenging to treat because chemical oxygen demand cod includes large quantities of toxic inhibitory compounds and coal derived liquors containing phenolics thiocyanate cyanides poly hydrocarbons and ammonium the eight most critical measured variables of water quality were selected as input parameters influent flow rates of bet units 2 and 3 influent chemical oxygen demand cod of bet units 2 and 3 dissolved oxygen do cyanide of bet 2 cn2 cyanide of bet 3 cn3 and mixed liquor suspended solids mlss the process data consisted of daily mean values for three years with 1040 observations the selected variable sets were randomly divided into a training set 695 datapoints and a test set 345 datapoints table 1 summarizes the process variables and displays the mean standard deviation and skewness values of the involved variables 2 2 sludge bulking detection phenomenon a detection approach was conceived and tested in a full scale wwtp in the event of thickening sludge an imbalance arises between floc forming bacteria and filamentous bacteria inhibiting the rapid development of sludge flocculants the reactors are typical industrial systems with non linear dynamics and interconnected effects of variables these findings illustrate the hurdles involved in identifying thickening sludge in wwtp model problems uncertainties and various dynamics filamentous bulking is a key component of the wwtp bulking loop when excessive filaments extend from the overall borders into the bulk medium the asp leads to delayed settling poor compaction and bulk sludge meanwhile filaments with gas bubbles and flocculent particles can produce biological moisture a detection technique to prevent the development of bulk sludge in real time is therefore needed urgently because of the imbalanced growth of filamentous bacteria and flocculent formation sludge bulking is an operational issue that promotes poor sludge settling performance as shown in fig 2 a sludge bulking can be classified into the following causes based on the primary factors promoting this abnormal state 31 1 low temperature sludge bulking 2 low ph sludge bulking 3 low do sludge bulking 4 nitrogen and phosphorus deficiency sludge bulking respectively 5 low sludge loading rate food to microorganism ratios f m due to these causes poor nutrient supply and conditional growth the biological sludge can be detached from the bottom the colloids produced by bacteria in activated sludge are removed lowering its specific gravity and causing it to float on the surface rather than settle at the bottom while the sludge water mixture is formed and discharged together the treated water cannot be clarified the output quality of treated water deteriorates while the sludge bulking issue reduces the operational mechanism s efficiency among the possible causes of sludge bulking the leading candidate is a deficiency of do as shown in fig 2 b filamentous bacteria at this state can increase faster than zoogloeal spp flocculent forming bacteria which generate filamentous sludge bulking the proliferation of filamentous bacteria occurs more rapidly in environments with low temperatures and ph as well however in conditions of low total phosphorus and total nitrogen concentrations filamentous bacteria with high surface to volume ratios more easily ingest substrates causing sludge bulking 32 the svi can be considered a numerical tool for the quantification of sludge settlement ability low svi values indicate that activated sludge is thick therefore the biomass is highly adjustable in the final clarifier the breakpoints correspond to a good category if the svi is less than 100 ml g moderate when 100 ml g svi 200 ml g and poor when svi is greater than 200 ml g 32 in this study the breakpoint for poor settlement is 150 ml g 11 2 3 the proposed method the methodology followed in this paper is divided into four parts as illustrated in fig 3 first the collected data from the wwtp is preprocessed including the missing data imputation and outlier removal the filtering technique consists of rosner s test 32 second the elm sae method complies with two roles the last layer comprises the output layer trained for modeling the svi and the intermediate layers yield provides a non linear representation of the existing relationships within the dynamic model third these two outputs are used as input for the dbn for bulking state classification fourth the proposed method is evaluated using different metrics depending on the task for the svi model performance was measured using the root mean square error rmse mean absolute percentage error mape and the coefficient of determination r 2 on the other hand bulking state classification used the metrics of accuracy precision sensitivity and specificity several other methods were introduced in this task to evaluate the superiority of the proposed framework first four different regression techniques for the svi modeling task were introduced including a dynamic arx model an autoencoder a bayesian approach and a radial basis forward neural network rbfnn 33 36 second four additional methods were utilized to classify the sludge bulking state including the linear discriminant the quadratic discriminant ridge and the adaboost classifiers tables s1 and s2 of the supplementary information si describe the structures and remarks of the utilized techniques to be compared with the proposed methods 37 39 2 3 1 svi modeling via a hybrid elm sae algorithm the selection of prediction methodologies is the most important aspect of predicting difficult to measure water quality indicators linear approaches do not always produce accurate models an sae is a deep learning architecture that employs autoencoders aes as building blocks in a greedy layer wise way 40 an ae uses two procedures to reassemble its input at the output layer encode and decode furthermore the elm is a feature extraction and classification technique that is rapidly evolving it employs random mapping sets the number of hidden layers to assign input weights and biases and calculates output weights using the least squares approach 41 random feature mapping of elms allows for universal approximation and enables more information for hidden layer representation the training time is much faster for elms than for other back propagation

the good classification performance of the developed model 3 results and discussion the proposed method consisted of two parts first the elm sae algorithm was trained to predict the svi values of the clarifier based on eight input parameters influent flow rates of bet units 2 q2 and 3 q3 influent cod of bet units 2 and 3 do cyanide of bet 2 cn2 cyanide of bet 3 cn3 and mlss in the final aeration basin the dbn was then trained to monitor the sludge bulking state of the secondary clarifier which could be classified as a normal bad or bulking state 3 1 svi prediction model operational data over 1040 days were used in the elm sae model the two layers of a sparse constraint sae were applied with the random mapping feature of an elm to the input data as the optimal network function the elm was designed in a layer wise manner in which the sae function was applied to the data to minimize the error the optimal network in the modeling process was chosen based on the minimum mse with l2 weight and sparsity regularizers the number of hidden neurons hidden layers feature space and the number of iterations to train the sae function affect the modeling performance of elm models networks several initialization parameters were investigated for the entire dataset to test the robustness of the proposed elm sae structure the weights initialization was chosen at random from a scaled conjugate gradient the values for the l2 weight regularizer sparsity regularizer and sparsity proportion were 0 03 4 and 0 05 respectively moreover 300 250 and 60 neurons were chosen for each layer accordingly the results of the elm sae based svi modeling for the test set are depicted in fig 5 the actual and predicted svi values are illustrated in fig 5 a the elm sae model could adapt to the pattern yielded in the dataset capturing peaks that were crucial for operational decision making fig 5 b depicts the correlation between the experimental and predicted svi values for the test sets depicting an adequate approximation on the test dataset fig 5 c and d are related to the residuals yielded by the elm sae method in which the values were maintained in the interval of 10 10 except for a single point that surpassed these intervals a quantile quantile plot of the residuals suggests that these errors have a close to a normal distribution and do not show extreme observations making this a robust method for svi modeling the visual performance of the svi modeling utilizing different methods can be seen in fig s1 of the si table 2 shows the performance of each evaluated metric for the svi modeling with the best metrics in bold compared to all introduced methods the proposed elm sae method was superior for all metrics the rmse for the training and test sets were 2 57 mg l and 2 88 mg l given the r 2 value the ideal scenario is near to unity for the training set the performance achieved a value of 1 while the test set achieved a value of 0 98 finally in the evaluation of the mape the proposed method reached the lowest error percentages of 4 07 and 3 75 for the training and test sets respectively fig 6 provides a visual comparison of the evaluated methods in the svi modeling task in fig 6 a the elm sae method describes the accurate performance of the svi values for the training and test sets this performance is followed by the tested autoencoder with a dynamic arx showing the most inadequate modeling performance in addition the absolute residual of the test results was analyzed and illustrated in fig 6 b which shows that the rbfnn exhibits considerable deviation of the residuals reaching values of 50 the dynamic arx exhibits a lower variation however some outliers reached values of more than 100 representing a threatening condition if this method is applied to the wwtp operation due to the lack of accuracy the bayesian model exhibits similar outlier yielding behavior reaching values of 75 the ae and the proposed model presented the lowest absolute residuals with corresponding deviations these results show that the suggested elm sae technique outperformed the other four models in predicting the svi sludge thickening is a severe problem in wwtps that use the asp hence measuring the svi is crucial accurately predicting the svi allows for the analysis of bulking state and prompt prevention of sludge bulking according to our findings the proposed elm sae approach can be employed for efficient online monitoring of the svi in a full scale wwtp 3 2 classification of sludge bulking states second a dbn classification algorithm was used with the feature space of random mapping of the elm to classify the states of sludge bulking in a secondary clarifier the feature extracted space operating parameters and other operating conditions e g the occurrence of toxicity state of the microorganisms and status of the aeration basin were used as input variables to train the dbn algorithm the input features were normalized between 0 9 and 0 9 to prevent saturation of the activation function the target values of the three states were normal 0 9 0 9 0 9 bad 0 9 0 9 0 9 and bulking 0 9 0 9 0 9 the dbn model s performance was optimized in terms of several parameters and the impacts of weights and biases initialized on the network s output to select the appropriate structure for the dbn model the number of hidden nodes hidden layers and epochs were defined and the batch size and learning rate the initialization of the weights was picked at random from a gaussian distribution with a mean of zero and a standard deviation of about 0 01 after the algorithm had been trained numerous times the number of hidden layers and nodes with the lowest rmse values were chosen the dbn was altered with two hidden layers each with 50 and 10 hidden nodes fig 7 depicts the different bulking states in the test set as classified based on the dbn in red with the actual state represented in black dots the results confirmed that the state decision of the secondary clarifier could be achieved through quantitative analysis of the elm sae feature space as the parameters have different values in each state in the test mode the maximum test set was chosen to better estimate the present state at each point based on how correctly it measured the state of the dynamic process in the test data only the normal and bad states were present the classification of each state with true and calculated values as shown in fig 7 a c represents normal bad and bulk states given the bulking state the dbn model was able to identify and classify the state correctly four additional methods were introduced to classify the sludge bulking states including linear discriminant quadratic discriminant ridge and adaboost classifiers the results were quantified through four metrics including accuracy precision specificity and sensitivity fig 8 a illustrates the comparison of the different methods with the proposed classification method it can be observed that the dbn classification method got the highest values in the four metrics concerning the linear discriminant the proposed method was improved by 36 considering the classification accuracy while for the adaboost classifier the accuracy was improved by 3 this same behavior can be noted for the different metrics in the bulking state classification as provided in table 3 showing in bold the metrics with superior performance moreover a confusion matrix was developed to represent the classification results from the test set as shown in fig 8 b the matrix diagonal shows the corrected classified numbers in the given matrix and the off diagonal displays the fixed and uncorrected classified numbers the classification results of the proposed dbn model were 90 70 accurate on average in addition the model had a precision rate of 91 01 and a sensitivity of 95 88 even though the secondary clarifier was run under a wide range of operating conditions the proposed hybrid model demonstrated a superior prediction capability compared to different shallow models for online monitoring of sludge bulking the findings indicate that the dbn can extract a random feature space yielding more reliable classification results than the introduced models the dbn avoids getting stuck in local minima and can prevent overfitting making it possible to classify the non linear dynamic states of wwtps accurately the results of state variables should prove helpful to engineers for monitoring and promptly detecting sludge bulking states in a wwtp 4 conclusions recognition of the process states of a secondary clarifier enables effective decision making and enhances operational efficiency for the wastewater treatment process in this paper an intelligent svi model was formulated to predict and classify water quality in wwtps the proposed model was developed with an elm sae to improve the accuracy of the predictions and a dbn model to classify the current state of the clarifier this approach differs from conventional approaches because a learning algorithm addresses the characteristics of the system a significant advantage of the elm sae method is that it updates the weights in each layer and allows universal features approximation keeping the dbn model tuned to the current system dynamics the elm method enhances the capacity of the autoencoder and improves the dbn model s ability to adapt to non linear dynamic systems the adaptive model developed in this study yielded an improved predictive performance compared with conventional methods in a wastewater treatment context in terms of its predictive performance the proposed model which combines an elm sae and a dbn could match the non linear system dynamics more accurately than other models providing enhanced performance in the overall operating system the elm sae model was able to predict svi values more accurately the subsequent dbn model determined the sludge bulking states more accurately than traditional modeling methods with average accuracy values of 98 39 and 90 70 respectively the proposed method could also efficiently and simultaneously predict the svi value of a secondary clarifier and classify the

13103,in biological wastewater treatment plants wwtps sludge thickening is a common problem with major economic and environmental effects monitoring the sludge volume index svi is a critical difficulty in sludge bulking quantification this study develops a hybrid deep learning based soft sensor that uses a sparse constraint stacked autoencoder sae model to estimate svi and classify bulking states in wwtp effluent to improve effluent quality the weights of the sae in a training plan were adjusted using an extreme learning machine elm technique a deep belief network technique was applied to the extracted feature space of the elm to classify the current state of a secondary clarifier the suggested methodology outperforms existing state of the art methods in the svi modeling task by 38 to 78 on the other hand the bulking state was properly classified with 90 7 accuracy and 91 precision graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords deep belief network extreme learning machine sludge bulking sludge volume index stacked autoencoder 1 introduction rapid population growth urbanization and industrialization focused on the need for clean water and improved wastewater treatment designs due to the limited water resources growing concerns about effluent quality requirements have put pressure on engineers to exploit real time monitoring technology and control biological wastewater treatment plants wwtps 1 47 although the activated sludge process asp is a typical biological technology employed in wwtps it is difficult to comprehend and regulate one of the essential phases in the asp is the secondary clarifier which separates activated sludge from treated effluent 2 poor effluent quality after the asp is usually caused by the secondary clarifier failing to remove suspended biomass from the treated water resulting in a condition known as sludge bulking 3 a soft or virtual sensor would allow the wwtp to be monitored sludge bulking to be avoided and plant control to be improved several recent studies have attempted to model the kinetic properties of filamentous bacteria in order to determine the cause of sludge bulking 4 image analysis was used by mesquita et al 2011 to provide morphological data and detect evidence of sludge bulking 5 wágner et al 6 presented a practical mathematical approach to modeling filamentous bulking based on computational fluid dynamics however because the process operators in a wwtp are dynamic it has proven difficult to capture the non linear dynamic behavior of the processes in a mathematical model in this context mechanistic methods for monitoring environmental systems have recently been outperformed by artificial intelligent techniques recognizing the benefits that accrue to a real time monitoring framework and resulting in a cost effective option for estimating hard to measure variables within the system 7 9 past investigations have been devoted to characterize the behavior and evolution of the sludge bulking phenomena for instance jenné et al 2007 described a fully automatic image analysis procedure that can reliably characterize activated sludge s flocculence and filament features 10 however because these methods operate offline and the prediction results rely on image quality none provide a definitive solution then machine learning techniques were introduced to amend these issues deepnarain et al 2019 proposed a decision tree model that identifies and predicts filamentous sludge bulking the model was studied as a function of organic loading and digital image analysis 12 mesquita et al 2016 combined partial least squares with image analysis to quantify the correlation between the settling ability of sludge and the results of image analysis 13 however due to the high non linearity of sludge bulking progression linear models often deviate significantly from the actual state early efforts on the non linearity issue in the sludge bulking holistic monitoring can be seen in the study of yoo et al 2002 who developed a model for svi prediction and sludge bulking classification using recursive least squares and neural networks 14 despite this progress implementing prediction models still takes a significant amount of time and effort especially in the present field of study 15 a model must capture the severe and non linear effects of operating factors on the ability of sludge to settle while sensing the noise in wwtps for the dynamic prediction of sludge bulking one potential method to compensate for the uncertainties in wwtps is to use neural networks with several hidden layers such as deep architectures 16 46 deep learning uses more non linear transformations than other approaches making it more effective at learning extremely non linear and varying functions 17 the emerging development of deep learning techniques has yielded impressive results when applied to vision language and chemometric datasets 18 in this context harrou et al 2018 applied an integrated deep belief network dbn to a one class support vector machine for fault detection monitoring in wwtps 19 ba alawi et al 2021 developed a novel semi supervised soft sensor model for the online prediction of multiple process variables in wwtps using a stacked autoencoder sae 21 however data driven models with multiple input layers may have unacceptably lengthy computational times this paper aims to overcome this problem utilizing extreme learning machines elms have made significant theoretical and applied contributions due to their rapid training time generalization abilities and universal classification ability 22 these elms have demonstrated excellent learning accuracy and speed in various applications such as face recognition 23 image segmentation 24 environmental dataset analysis 25 and human action recognition 26 the major goal of this article was to develop an innovative monitoring strategy to improve the operation and performance of wwtps deep learning techniques were utilized to create a soft sensor model capable of the following 1 modeling the evolution of the svi using an sae via training and stacking numerous layers of autoencoders 2 classifying the bulking state phenomenon in the secondary clarifier using a dbn 3 dealing with uncertainties and time constraints through combining sae with an extreme learning machine the suggested soft sensor model with uncertainty information was employed in a full scale wwtp to identify the bulking stage and control filamentous sludge bulking 2 materials and methods 2 1 full scale wastewater treatment process and data collection wastewater treatment involves non linear and dimensional interacting dynamics 27 large uncertainties 28 multivariable structures 29 and time varying inflow rates and pollutant concentrations 30 this study collected data from a biological wastewater treatment process at a steel and coke making plant in south korea a schematic diagram of the full scale activated sludge process is shown in fig 1 it consists of five aeration basins each 900 m3 a secondary clarifier 1200 m3 and two influent streams 14 one influent stream supplies wastewater directly from the coke making plant biological effluent treatment unit 3 bet 3 in contrast the other influent stream comprises pretreated wastewater from an upstream treatment plant at another coke making plant biological effluent treatment unit 2 bet 2 wastewater at a coke oven plant is produced during the conversion of coal to coke during steelmaking this wastewater is highly polluted and challenging to treat because chemical oxygen demand cod includes large quantities of toxic inhibitory compounds and coal derived liquors containing phenolics thiocyanate cyanides poly hydrocarbons and ammonium the eight most critical measured variables of water quality were selected as input parameters influent flow rates of bet units 2 and 3 influent chemical oxygen demand cod of bet units 2 and 3 dissolved oxygen do cyanide of bet 2 cn2 cyanide of bet 3 cn3 and mixed liquor suspended solids mlss the process data consisted of daily mean values for three years with 1040 observations the selected variable sets were randomly divided into a training set 695 datapoints and a test set 345 datapoints table 1 summarizes the process variables and displays the mean standard deviation and skewness values of the involved variables 2 2 sludge bulking detection phenomenon a detection approach was conceived and tested in a full scale wwtp in the event of thickening sludge an imbalance arises between floc forming bacteria and filamentous bacteria inhibiting the rapid development of sludge flocculants the reactors are typical industrial systems with non linear dynamics and interconnected effects of variables these findings illustrate the hurdles involved in identifying thickening sludge in wwtp model problems uncertainties and various dynamics filamentous bulking is a key component of the wwtp bulking loop when excessive filaments extend from the overall borders into the bulk medium the asp leads to delayed settling poor compaction and bulk sludge meanwhile filaments with gas bubbles and flocculent particles can produce biological moisture a detection technique to prevent the development of bulk sludge in real time is therefore needed urgently because of the imbalanced growth of filamentous bacteria and flocculent formation sludge bulking is an operational issue that promotes poor sludge settling performance as shown in fig 2 a sludge bulking can be classified into the following causes based on the primary factors promoting this abnormal state 31 1 low temperature sludge bulking 2 low ph sludge bulking 3 low do sludge bulking 4 nitrogen and phosphorus deficiency sludge bulking respectively 5 low sludge loading rate food to microorganism ratios f m due to these causes poor nutrient supply and conditional growth the biological sludge can be detached from the bottom the colloids produced by bacteria in activated sludge are removed lowering its specific gravity and causing it to float on the surface rather than settle at the bottom while the sludge water mixture is formed and discharged together the treated water cannot be clarified the output quality of treated water deteriorates while the sludge bulking issue reduces the operational mechanism s efficiency among the possible causes of sludge bulking the leading candidate is a deficiency of do as shown in fig 2 b filamentous bacteria at this state can increase faster than zoogloeal spp flocculent forming bacteria which generate filamentous sludge bulking the proliferation of filamentous bacteria occurs more rapidly in environments with low temperatures and ph as well however in conditions of low total phosphorus and total nitrogen concentrations filamentous bacteria with high surface to volume ratios more easily ingest substrates causing sludge bulking 32 the svi can be considered a numerical tool for the quantification of sludge settlement ability low svi values indicate that activated sludge is thick therefore the biomass is highly adjustable in the final clarifier the breakpoints correspond to a good category if the svi is less than 100 ml g moderate when 100 ml g svi 200 ml g and poor when svi is greater than 200 ml g 32 in this study the breakpoint for poor settlement is 150 ml g 11 2 3 the proposed method the methodology followed in this paper is divided into four parts as illustrated in fig 3 first the collected data from the wwtp is preprocessed including the missing data imputation and outlier removal the filtering technique consists of rosner s test 32 second the elm sae method complies with two roles the last layer comprises the output layer trained for modeling the svi and the intermediate layers yield provides a non linear representation of the existing relationships within the dynamic model third these two outputs are used as input for the dbn for bulking state classification fourth the proposed method is evaluated using different metrics depending on the task for the svi model performance was measured using the root mean square error rmse mean absolute percentage error mape and the coefficient of determination r 2 on the other hand bulking state classification used the metrics of accuracy precision sensitivity and specificity several other methods were introduced in this task to evaluate the superiority of the proposed framework first four different regression techniques for the svi modeling task were introduced including a dynamic arx model an autoencoder a bayesian approach and a radial basis forward neural network rbfnn 33 36 second four additional methods were utilized to classify the sludge bulking state including the linear discriminant the quadratic discriminant ridge and the adaboost classifiers tables s1 and s2 of the supplementary information si describe the structures and remarks of the utilized techniques to be compared with the proposed methods 37 39 2 3 1 svi modeling via a hybrid elm sae algorithm the selection of prediction methodologies is the most important aspect of predicting difficult to measure water quality indicators linear approaches do not always produce accurate models an sae is a deep learning architecture that employs autoencoders aes as building blocks in a greedy layer wise way 40 an ae uses two procedures to reassemble its input at the output layer encode and decode furthermore the elm is a feature extraction and classification technique that is rapidly evolving it employs random mapping sets the number of hidden layers to assign input weights and biases and calculates output weights using the least squares approach 41 random feature mapping of elms allows for universal approximation and enables more information for hidden layer representation the training time is much faster for elms than for other back propagation

given the r 2 value the ideal scenario is near to unity for the training set the performance achieved a value of 1 while the test set achieved a value of 0 98 finally in the evaluation of the mape the proposed method reached the lowest error percentages of 4 07 and 3 75 for the training and test sets respectively fig 6 provides a visual comparison of the evaluated methods in the svi modeling task in fig 6 a the elm sae method describes the accurate performance of the svi values for the training and test sets this performance is followed by the tested autoencoder with a dynamic arx showing the most inadequate modeling performance in addition the absolute residual of the test results was analyzed and illustrated in fig 6 b which shows that the rbfnn exhibits considerable deviation of the residuals reaching values of 50 the dynamic arx exhibits a lower variation however some outliers reached values of more than 100 representing a threatening condition if this method is applied to the wwtp operation due to the lack of accuracy the bayesian model exhibits similar outlier yielding behavior reaching values of 75 the ae and the proposed model presented the lowest absolute residuals with corresponding deviations these results show that the suggested elm sae technique outperformed the other four models in predicting the svi sludge thickening is a severe problem in wwtps that use the asp hence measuring the svi is crucial accurately predicting the svi allows for the analysis of bulking state and prompt prevention of sludge bulking according to our findings the proposed elm sae approach can be employed for efficient online monitoring of the svi in a full scale wwtp 3 2 classification of sludge bulking states second a dbn classification algorithm was used with the feature space of random mapping of the elm to classify the states of sludge bulking in a secondary clarifier the feature extracted space operating parameters and other operating conditions e g the occurrence of toxicity state of the microorganisms and status of the aeration basin were used as input variables to train the dbn algorithm the input features were normalized between 0 9 and 0 9 to prevent saturation of the activation function the target values of the three states were normal 0 9 0 9 0 9 bad 0 9 0 9 0 9 and bulking 0 9 0 9 0 9 the dbn model s performance was optimized in terms of several parameters and the impacts of weights and biases initialized on the network s output to select the appropriate structure for the dbn model the number of hidden nodes hidden layers and epochs were defined and the batch size and learning rate the initialization of the weights was picked at random from a gaussian distribution with a mean of zero and a standard deviation of about 0 01 after the algorithm had been trained numerous times the number of hidden layers and nodes with the lowest rmse values were chosen the dbn was altered with two hidden layers each with 50 and 10 hidden nodes fig 7 depicts the different bulking states in the test set as classified based on the dbn in red with the actual state represented in black dots the results confirmed that the state decision of the secondary clarifier could be achieved through quantitative analysis of the elm sae feature space as the parameters have different values in each state in the test mode the maximum test set was chosen to better estimate the present state at each point based on how correctly it measured the state of the dynamic process in the test data only the normal and bad states were present the classification of each state with true and calculated values as shown in fig 7 a c represents normal bad and bulk states given the bulking state the dbn model was able to identify and classify the state correctly four additional methods were introduced to classify the sludge bulking states including linear discriminant quadratic discriminant ridge and adaboost classifiers the results were quantified through four metrics including accuracy precision specificity and sensitivity fig 8 a illustrates the comparison of the different methods with the proposed classification method it can be observed that the dbn classification method got the highest values in the four metrics concerning the linear discriminant the proposed method was improved by 36 considering the classification accuracy while for the adaboost classifier the accuracy was improved by 3 this same behavior can be noted for the different metrics in the bulking state classification as provided in table 3 showing in bold the metrics with superior performance moreover a confusion matrix was developed to represent the classification results from the test set as shown in fig 8 b the matrix diagonal shows the corrected classified numbers in the given matrix and the off diagonal displays the fixed and uncorrected classified numbers the classification results of the proposed dbn model were 90 70 accurate on average in addition the model had a precision rate of 91 01 and a sensitivity of 95 88 even though the secondary clarifier was run under a wide range of operating conditions the proposed hybrid model demonstrated a superior prediction capability compared to different shallow models for online monitoring of sludge bulking the findings indicate that the dbn can extract a random feature space yielding more reliable classification results than the introduced models the dbn avoids getting stuck in local minima and can prevent overfitting making it possible to classify the non linear dynamic states of wwtps accurately the results of state variables should prove helpful to engineers for monitoring and promptly detecting sludge bulking states in a wwtp 4 conclusions recognition of the process states of a secondary clarifier enables effective decision making and enhances operational efficiency for the wastewater treatment process in this paper an intelligent svi model was formulated to predict and classify water quality in wwtps the proposed model was developed with an elm sae to improve the accuracy of the predictions and a dbn model to classify the current state of the clarifier this approach differs from conventional approaches because a learning algorithm addresses the characteristics of the system a significant advantage of the elm sae method is that it updates the weights in each layer and allows universal features approximation keeping the dbn model tuned to the current system dynamics the elm method enhances the capacity of the autoencoder and improves the dbn model s ability to adapt to non linear dynamic systems the adaptive model developed in this study yielded an improved predictive performance compared with conventional methods in a wastewater treatment context in terms of its predictive performance the proposed model which combines an elm sae and a dbn could match the non linear system dynamics more accurately than other models providing enhanced performance in the overall operating system the elm sae model was able to predict svi values more accurately the subsequent dbn model determined the sludge bulking states more accurately than traditional modeling methods with average accuracy values of 98 39 and 90 70 respectively the proposed method could also efficiently and simultaneously predict the svi value of a secondary clarifier and classify the

13104,a dual layer dl pvdf loose nanofiltration nf hollow fiber membrane hfm with desirable properties was designed via phase inversion process using a continuous online coating device by fine tuning dope formulation and fiber formation the pvdf coating layer with nf separation capabilities was formed on the shell side of porous matrix reinforced hollow fiber support while making fiber continuously the effects of several parameters e g licl content co solvent ratio i e dmac thf and air bath distance evaporation time on structures and properties were investigated to manipulate membrane mwco it was found that the introduction of volatile co solvent and the control of evaporation time helped to significantly reduce the pvdf selective layer s thickness the structure along with performance of the hfm demonstrated the dl ultrafiltration uf hfm could be successfully converted into nf hfm only by adjusting the parameters in the production system after optimizing both phase inversion parameters and coating conditions the resultant loose nf hfm presented a low mwco of 1530 da and a high pure water flux pwf of 14 2 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 meanwhile the hfm showed competitive dyes rejection i e 99 9 for rose bengal and eriochrome black t 96 5 for methylene blue and low nacl rejection 3 2 furthermore the prepared membrane also presented good stability and high flux recovery during a continuous nf process this work provided a simple and economical strategy for engineering scalable loose nf hfm for dye purification graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords hollow fiber membrane loose nanofiltration dual layer membrane phase inversion dye salt separation 1 introduction synthetic dyes from textile wastewater which are toxic complex and difficult to degrade 1 large amount of dyes are discharged into surrounding water body which will bring threats to environment and human health 2 3 in addition the existence of inorganic salts na2so4 5 6 wt or nacl 6 wt increases the difficulty of biodegradation and purification 4 there are many traditional methods to treating textile wastewater such as adsorption 5 biological degradation 6 advanced oxidation 7 and precipitation 8 unfortunately these techniques have limitations that dyes and salts are not sufficiently recycled nanofiltration nf has shown great merits in wastewater treatment and dye purification owing to its advantages such as excellent selectivity and low energy cost 9 however conventional nf membranes present high rejection rates toward inorganic salts which increase the difficulty of dye and salt recovery thus limiting the practical application of nf in textile wastewater for example a commercial nf membrane i e sepro nf 2a has 99 6 rejection to congo red and 30 retention to nacl but with over 90 retention to na2so4 which reduces the separation efficiency for dye salt mixture 10 recently more and more attention has been drawn to the fabrication of loose nf membranes featuring high passages of salt without sacrificing dye retention which make them more suitable for dye salt separation several methods such as in situ growth on surface of hydrolyzed polyacrylonitrile pan 11 12 surface deposition from polyphenols e g dopamine da tannic acid ta and catechol 13 15 interfacial polymerization ip using new monomers e g meso erythritol me polyether amine pea and ta 2 4 16 blending phase inversion e g blending nanomaterials cerium oxide ceo2 halloysite nanotubes hnts and molybdenum disulfide mos2 1 17 18 have been proposed to fabricate the loose nf membrane these modified membranes showed high flux and good dye salt selectivity nevertheless these reported membranes are predominantly flat sheet membrane involving intricate synthesis procedures and expensive raw materials in membrane fabrication which largely restricted its large scale fabrication and application in textile wastewater comparing with flat sheet and spiral wound membrane loose nf membranes in the hollow fiber hf configuration have unique advantages such as self supporting structure great surface area per fiber large scale fabrication high packing density and good flexibility in operation 19 21 it may be pointed out that most of commercially available nf membranes were made by ip method on an ultrafiltration flat sheet membrane 19 22 in view of the difficulties of ip reaction on the shell side of fine hf the application of nf in hf configuration was largely restricted and there was no commercial application at present 21 23 phase inversion was not widely applied for the nf membrane because it was difficult to get an nf membrane with high salts rejection fortunately the membrane fabricated via phase inversion procedure seemed easier for producing loose nf membranes with a larger pore size which was favorable for treating textile wastewater 24 for instance thong et al 25 fabricated polyethersulfone pes loose nf hfm via blending sulfonated polysulfone spsf into spinning dope the prepared spsf pes membrane showed a relatively high pwf of 13 2 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 and a high dye rejections 94 9 han et al 22 developed pei torlon sppsu loose nf hfm via blending polyphenylenesulfone sppsu into torlon dope solution and then application of pei as the crosslinking agent to achieve nf performance the membrane exhibited high rejections of 95 5 99 9 to tested dyes and pwf of 16 3 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 whereas a low na2so4 rejection 10 nevertheless these membranes usually require blending or post treatment to realize loose nf performances phase inversion parameters e g co solvent ratio solvent type and additives etc were regulated to narrow the pore size and thus obtain loose nf membranes without the need to apply post treatments or make materials blend for instance huang et al 26 fabricated poly m phenylene isophthalamide pmia flat sheet membrane with nf performance by tuning dope formulation e g licl and polyvinyl pyrrolidone pvp the prepared membranes exhibited high rejections of 98 to tested dyes and low retention of 5 5 to nacl mertens et al 27 prepared poly vinylidene fluoride pvdf loose nf flat sheet membrane by tuning phase inversion parameters e g pvdf concentration n methyl 2 pyrrolidone nmp thf ratio and evaporation time the obtained pvdf membrane showed improved methyl orange 320 da retention of 80 but an extremely low permeability 1 8 l m2 h bar due to entire cross section structure of the membrane became tighter and they did not report the separation performance of dye salt mixtures although these membranes with performances in the nf range were predominantly flat sheet membranes this may provide an efficient strategy to prepare loose nf hollow membranes via tuning phase inversion parameters furthermore an ideal loose nf hollow fiber membrane structure should have a support layer with high mechanical strength and filtration reliability for operating in textile wastewater under high pressures and a separation layer with a nf range pore size for excellent dye salt selectivity and reasonably high porosity to maintain high water flux therefore it is vital to explore ways of developing composite hollow fiber membrane with nf separation capabilities and reinforced mechanical strength via simple scalable and cost effective procedure pvdf has been widely used for membrane preparation because it not only possesses inherent high stability good mechanical strength and high thermal stability but also is cheaper than polyimide pi and polybenzimidazole pbi 28 30 thus these outstanding physiochemical properties make it suitable for textile wastewater treatment pvdf hfm made via thermally induced phase separation tips technology has been demonstrated to provide high mechanical strength and permeation flux due to its bi continuous pore structures 31 for instance liu et al 32 prepared dual layer dl polyethersulfone pvdf pes pvdf hfm by producing pvdf inner layer in the tips method followed by forming pes outer layer in the phase inversion method the dl membrane exhibited excellent durability and improved separation performance in wastewater treatment but it failed to obtain nf property and need further interfacial polymerization to realize the transition from uf to loose nf membrane 33 in this study we propose a simple and scalable procedure for engineering dl pvdf hollow fiber membranes hfms with nf separation capabilities without post treatment or blending in this method loose nf hfms were designed by phase inversion process using self designed online coating device more specifically a commercially available porous matrix reinforced pvdf microfiltration mf hollow fiber membrane is used as a support by accurately tuning of the parameters involved in the dope formulation and fiber formation e g licl content co solvent ratio dmac thf and air bath distance the pvdf coating layer with nf separation capabilities was formed on the shell side of porous matrix reinforced hollow fiber support while making fiber continuously furthermore the structure along with performance of the hfm demonstrated that the dl uf hfm could be successfully converted into nf hfm only by adjusting the parameters in the production system the preparation procedure is facile cost effective scalable and without post treatment which favored large scale fabrication of low cost loose nf hfm this study may offer a strategy for economically advantageous and feasible fabrication of dl loose nf hfm for purification of dye wastewater 2 experimental 2 1 materials porous matrix reinforced pvdf hfm and pvdf powder were acquired from tianjin motimo co china the outer and internal diameters of the hfm average pore radius 45 nm pwf 823 l m2 h bar were approximately 1 0 mm and 0 6 mm respectively n n dimethylacetamide dmac tetrahydrofuran thf and acetone were acquired from tianjin kemiou chemical reagent co china methylene blue mb rose bengal rb methyl orange mo and eriochrome black t ebt were obtained from aladdin industrial co china the detailed information of these dyes was presented in table 1 lithium chloride licl and polyethylene glycol peg was supplied by macklin reagent china 2 2 preparation of the dl pvdf loose nf hfm a series of coating solutions consisted of pvdf dmac licl were obtained by adding pvdf powder into a well mixed dmac licl solution under stirring the content of pvdf was 22 wt and licl ranged between 0 and 3 wt licl was widely used pore forming agent to form uf membrane with excellent porosity and permeation flux 34 35 the coating solutions made of pvdf dmac thf licl were obtained by dissolving licl and pvdf with dmac and thf as the solvent and co solvent respectively and stirred overnight until a homogenous solution was obtained thf was added into coating solution because of its high volatility which facilitated the solvent to evaporate from the membrane surface before phase inversion in a coagulation bath 27 36 37 fig 1b shows the formation mechanism of dense skin layer the relative polymer concentration on the coating layer surface increased which would delay the solvent non solvent exchange rate and slow down the mass transfer rate thereby leading to further densification of the skin layer in addition the mixtures of dmac and thf with different weight ratios i e 100 0 0 thf 95 5 5 thf 85 15 15 thf 75 25 25 thf were set in this experiment air bubbles in solution were removed by degassing for 12 h in this work we first tuned licl content to appropriately reduce the pore size of dl hfm more importantly the addition of licl greatly increased the porosity of hfm and thus increases membrane flux next we tuned other parameters e g dmac thf ration and air bath distance to obtain a desired pore size the dl pvdf loose nf hfms were designed via phase inversion process using a self designed online coating device the detailed procedure for one step production of loose nf hfms was shown in fig 1 the above well mixed solutions were poured into a self designed coating device along the upper pipe wall the porous matrix reinforced hollow fiber passed through the pvdf solution vertically under a speed of 3 cm s and the fiber was continuously coated on the outer surface from spool to spool subsequently the coated hollow fiber entered the coagulation bath after passing through an air bath under the traction where the pvdf solution was converted into a thin selective layer via optimized phase inversion process air bath distance was also a key parameter to obtain separation layer with nf properties during the coating process different distances of air bath were set to control the evaporation time of the volatile co solvent before phase inversion in a coagulation bath the transition from uf to loose nf membrane could be easily realized by fine tuning of the dope formulation and fiber formation in the production system the coating formulation was displayed in table 2 and the prepared dl hollow fiber membranes at various parameters were listed in table 3 finally the bundled fibers were immersed in water container for one day and then immersed in a water glycerol 70 30 wt solution for two days to preserve hfm structures 2 3 characterizations of dl pvdf hfms morphologies of dl pvdf hfms were examined by desktop scanning electron microscope sem phenom xl netherlands and field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem regulus 8100 japan charge property of the hollow fiber surface was analyzed by an electrokinetic analyzer anton paar graz austria the mechanical properties were tested by electronic universal material testing machine ags x hongkong shimadzu corp china an effective length of between clamps was set to 2 5 cm the average values of five fibers were recorded pore size distribution and molecular weight cut off mwco of the resultant hfms were determined through filtrating neutral polyethylene glycol peg 200 ppm solutes a total organic carbon analyzer toc vcph shimadzu japan were performed to test the concentrations of pegs before cf ppm and after cp ppm filtration the rejection r of each solute was calculated from 1 r 1 c p c f 100 the solute stokes radius r s can be obtained based on the molecular weight mw of peg as following 38 2 r s 0 01673 m w 0 557 m w 35 000 when the r for peg was 90 the corresponding solute molecular weight is defined as mwco of hfm the pore size distribution of hfm was evaluated using eq 3 39 3 d r r p d r p 1 r p ln σ p 2 π exp ln r p ln μ p 2 2 ln σ p 2 where mean pore size μp nm is pore radius rp nm at which rejection rate is 50 the geometric standard deviation σp is defined as ratio of rp when rejection rate is 84 13 and 50 respectively 2 4 filtration performance of hfms filtration performance of hfms was evaluated via a lab scale cross flow device as shown in fig s1 all test modules were stabilized for 1 h under 0 5 mpa meanwhile salt and dye concentrations were examined using conductivity meter thermo scientific orion star belgium and uv vis spectrophotometer uv 1601 shimadzu japan respectively the flux j l m 2 h 1 bar 1 and rejection r was obtained from eqs 4 and 5

filtration would run continuously for 48 h filtration performance were detected the fouling resistance of the loose nf hfm was studied using rb and ebt solutions 50 ppm at 25 c 0 5 mpa the membrane was first filtrated with di water for 60 min and the pwf were tested every 10 min the filtrating feed solution was then replaced with the dye solutions for 60 min and the permeate flux was monitored during the filtration the fouled hfms were thoroughly rinsed with di water for 30 min again the pwf of the cleaned membrane was measured the index i e total pollution ft irreversible pollution fir

average value of initial pwf l m 2 h 1 bar 1 foulant solution flux and pwf after cleaning respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 morphology and structure of hfms 3 1 1 morphologies of dl pvdf hfms the formed pvdf separation layer was formed on the shell side of porous matrix reinforced hf mf membrane via phase inversion process using an online coating device the morphologies of neat pvdf mf membrane produced by tips method are shown in fig s2 such unique reinforced fiber was used as the support to make high strength hfm for uf and nf applications fig 2 shows the cross sections a b and d f and outer surface c of the dl pvdf loose nf hfm m 5 while fig 3 shows the outer surface a and cross sections b d of the dl pvdf uf hfm m 2 the obvious variation in the prepared dl pvdf loose nf membrane compared with dl pvdf uf membrane could be found the dl pvdf uf membrane had smooth and featureless outer surface with visible small pores fig 3a while the dl pvdf loose nf membrane had a rough surface with large pores fig 2c the porous outer surface should be the trace left by the volatilization of thf from membrane surface before entering the coagulant bath it should be noted that these pores do not transverse across the entire skin layer as shown in fig 2d f the cross sectional sem image in fig 2b and d showed that a homogenous and dense pvdf thin skin layer was coated on the reinforced pvdf hollow fiber support fig 2d was the enlarged cross section of fig 2b for clearer observation the dense pvdf selective layer was around 7 μm furthermore it could be clearly seen from fig 2d that the formed pvdf separation layer fitted closely with the underlying reinforced pvdf substrate due to the fact that good miscibility of the same polymer thus indicating delamination free dl pvdf loose nf membranes were obtained the delamination free structure was the most fundamental requirement for membrane separation performance during manufacturing dl membranes from immiscible polymers direct delamination of the separation layer and the support layer often occurs in the coagulation bath which greatly deteriorated membrane structural stability and selectivity the skin layer of m 2 membrane exhibited a common asymmetric structure in morphology i e finger like pores and spongy like structure as shown in fig 3b d in contrast the typical asymmetric structure was not observed on the cross sections of the prepared m 5 membrane fig 2d f the tight structure for m 5 membrane resulted from the synergistic effects of volatile co solvent thf and evaporation time see fig 1b 40 the skin layer structure could be easily changed by fine tuning dope formulation and fiber formation as shown later 3 1 2 effects of licl content on morphology of dl pvdf uf hfms licl had been widely used in the fabrication of polymer membranes 34 fig 4 presents the cross sectional morphologies of dl pvdf uf hfms prepared at different licl content 0 2 and 3 wt while pvdf concentrations was fixed at 22 wt as licl content increased the macrovoids decreased in the size and the sponge like structure increased due to the delayed demixing process caused by increased viscosity of the casting solution as shown in fig 4b3 d3 the results were consistent with the conclusions from reported literature 41 42 the addition of licl into the casting solution tended to increase viscosity of the system due to the complex of licl with solvent and or the interaction of licl and pvdf 35 43 this sponge like structure was helpful to provide small micropores for good selectivity as examined in the following sections besides the thicknesses of pvdf separation layers ranged from 20 to 22 μm 3 1 3 effects of thf content on morphology of dl pvdf loose nf hfms in order to obtain pvdf separation layer with denser structure thf was used as a volatile co solvent and added into coating solution for further tuning the phase inversion process fig 5 shows the cross sectional morphologies of the dl pvdf loose nf hfms fabricated at various thf content 0 5 15 25 where other parameters were fixed i e pvdf concentration 22 wt licl content 2 wt and air bath distance 90 cm as shown in fig 5a1 a3 a common asymmetric morphological structure consisting of varied types of structure i e finger like pores and spongy like structure could be clearly observed when only licl was added to the coating solution the denser pvdf separation layer was uniformly formed on the shell side of porous matrix reinforced hollow fiber support when the introduction of thf into pvdf coating solution and the results are shown in fig 5b1 d3 more importantly the cross sectional images show that when the air bath distance was fixed 90 cm evaporation time 30 s the pvdf separation layer was significantly thinner about 6 5 10 μm than that without thf 20 22 μm more detailed range values of pvdf separation layer s thickness at different parameters are listed in table s1 the results indicated the presence of thf helped to remarkably reduce the thickness of the pvdf separation layer when the thickness of the separation layer becomes thinner its structure became denser this may be due to that the thf solvent evaporated the pvdf separation layer was compacted and thus the membrane pores would shrink and became smaller resulting in a thinner and denser separation layer structure furthermore the enlarged cross sections and outer surfaces of the pvdf separation layer fabricated with various dmac thf ratio are also presented in fig 6 as shown in fig 6a1 the pvdf separation layer consisted of typical finger like pores and spongy like structure when the membrane prepared without thf interestingly we could clearly observe the transformation in membrane structure from finger like sponge like structure to interlocking network like structure as shown in fig 6b1 d1 clear comparisons between the membrane prepared with 5 thf fig 6b1 and the membrane prepared with 15 thf or 25 thf fig 6c1 d1 obtained from enlarged cross sectional images indicated that higher thf content resulted in tighter cross sectional structure the formation of tight cross sectional structure was helpful to provide low mwco and small mean pore size for excellent selectivity as examined in the following sections moreover the surface of dl loose nf hfm prepared with thf became rougher compared with the one prepared without thf as show in fig 6b2 d2 3 1 4 effects of air bath distance on morphology of dl pvdf hfms evaporation of thf before phase inversion in a water bath was the key to obtain dense structure if only thf was added without the evaporation step it was difficult to obtain a loose nf structure thus the membrane was further tuned with different air bath distance evaporation time fig 7 shows the cross sectional structures of the dl pvdf loose nf hfms fabricated at various air bath distance where other parameters were fixed i e pvdf concentration 22 wt licl content 2 wt and thf content 15 as shown in fig 7a2 c2 the thicknesses of outer layers were 17 7 6 and 7 6 μm for membrane with 0 30 and 60 s evaporation respectively it should be noted that when the addition of thf 15 without the evaporation step the pvdf separation layer s thickness was slightly reduced compared with that without thf with the increase of the evaporation time the pvdf separation layer s thickness obviously decreased which indicated the evaporation step could effectively reduce the thickness of the separation layer resulting in the formation of a thinner pvdf selective layer the result confirmed our above conjecture that the evaporation of thf would lead to a thinner pvdf separation layer with further extension of the evaporation time the change in thickness was not obvious furthermore clear comparisons between the membrane prepared with 0 s evaporation time fig 8a1 and the membrane prepared with 30 s or 60 s evaporation time fig 8b1 c1 obtained from enlarged cross sectional images indicated that evaporation step resulted in tighter cross sectional structure meanwhile the rough surface of selective layer could be observed with prolonging evaporation time as shown in fig 8b2 and c2 3 2 molecular weight cut off mwco and pore size of the dl pvdf hfms in order to further demonstrate the pvdf selective layer with nf separation capabilities we measured the pore size and mwco of dl loose nf hfms m 5 as shown in fig 9a this property of dl pvdf hollow fiber uf membrane m 2 was also examined for comparison as shown in fig 9b results shown that the prepared dl pvdf hollow fiber uf membrane had a larger pore size of 2 80 nm with wider pore size distribution and the corresponding mwco was 13 45 kda as expected the mean pore size was reduced from 2 80 nm to 1 32 nm with narrower pore size distribution by the formation of denser pvdf separation layer the denser separation layer contributed to reduce mwco of dl hfms which was consistent with sem observations it may be pointed out that most of the commercially available nf membranes have a low mwco below 500 da and smaller pore size below 1 nm which was not suitable for dyes and salts recovery applications due to higher rejection for inorganic salts 24 phase inversion was not widely applied for the nf membrane because it was difficult to get an nf membrane with high salts rejection fortunately the dl pvdf hollow fiber nf membrane fabricated via online phase inversion procedure seemed easier for producing loose nf membranes with a much larger mwco which was favorable for treating textile wastewater due to a complete rejection for dyes and low rejection to salts besides most of commercially available nf membranes were prepared by ip method and predominantly thin film composite tfc flat sheet membranes 19 in view of the difficulties of ip reaction on the shell side of fine hf the application of nf in hollow fiber configurations was largely restricted 21 23 interestingly this is the first attempt to apply an easy phase inversion process on the surface of porous matrix reinforced hollow fibers to make dual layer membrane for nf application fig 9c and d shows the pore size distribution and mwco of dl hfms prepared at different parameters i e dmac thf ratios and evaporation time while licl content was fixed at 2 wt on entire preparation process table 4 summarizes their mwco and mean pore diameter μp values the mean pore size was reduced from 1 45 to 1 28 nm and its pore size distribution became narrower with the increase of thf content ranging from 5 to 25 as shown in fig 9c thus the corresponding mwco dropped from 2640 to 1310 da which indicated the formed pvdf separation layer became denser with the increasing thf content with increase evaporation time from 0 to 30 s we could clearly observe that the mwco of the resultant membranes showed a significant descending tendency as shown in fig 9d compared with the hfm without evaporation step the hfm with evaporation time 30 s had a narrow pore size distribution and small pore size of 1 32 nm which indicated the evaporation step was the key to obtain membrane with pore size in the nf range these changes indicated that the dl uf hfm could be successfully converted into nf hfm only by adjusting the parameters in the production system the transformation in the properties i e mwco and mean pore size also explained that the change in performance of the dl pvdf hfms discussed below from uf into nf range the results were attributed that the application of thf in the coating solution would facilitate the evaporation of solvent from the surface of pvdf separation layer before entering the coagulant bath thus altering the phase inversion process of the system and resulting in further densification of the top skin layer 3 3 optimization of membrane performance fig 10a shows the influence of licl content on the performance of the resulting dl pvdf hfms as expected increasing the licl content from 0 to 2 wt resulted in an increase in pure water flux 8 6 to 42 8 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 and rejection to ebt 70 3 to 87 6 and mb 50 3 to 76 0 the further increasing licl content there were no significant changes in dyes rejection whereas the flux decreased slightly the application of licl would produce more sponge like structure for the prepared uf membrane fig 4 which was helpful to provide small micropores for good selectivity in addition the addition of licl into the coating solution tended to produce membranes with good porosity resulting in enhanced permeation performance 43 2 wt was chosen as the optimal licl content for the fabrication of uf membrane in view of a higher flux and improved rejection to dyes fig 10b represents the effect of volatile co solvent thf a key parameter on performance of dl pvdf loose nf hfms during an evaporation step 30 s when 5 thf was used as co solvent the pwf decreased from 42 8 to 16 5 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 while the rejection of ebt and mb increased from 87 6 to 99 9 and 76 0 to 94 0 respectively with increasing the thf content from 5 to 15 the pure water flux slightly declined from 16 5 to 14 2 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 while the rejection of mb was improved from 94 0 to 96 5 further increasing the thf content to 25 there was slight change on performance of dl pvdf loose nf hfm the performance data were consistent with the information from membrane morphologies and mwco 15 was chosen as the optimal thf content in view of the higher flux outstanding rejection to ebt 99 9 and mb 96 5 as the addition of thf without evaporation step was difficult to obtain target nf performance the evaporation step was the key to obtain loose nf membrane thus the effect of air bath distance evaporation time another key parameter on performance of dl pvdf loose nf hfms was explored where other parameters were fixed i e the licl content 2 wt and thf concentration 15 as shown in fig 10c the prepared hfm with 15 thf without evaporation step 0 s had a high pwf of 30 7 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 and rejection for ebt 99 2 whereas a low rejection for mb 85 0 due to its low molecular weight the rejections of mb were 96 5 and 97 0 for the prepared membranes with 30 and 60 s evaporation time respectively consequently 30 s was chosen as the optimal evaporation time as the higher water flux high rejection to dyes the structure along with performance of the hfm indicated that the dl uf hfm could be successfully converted into nf hfm by simply tuning phase inversion process in order to reach desirable separation performance i e competitive flux and rejection to dyes nf membrane fabricated with optimized parameters thf content 15 and evaporation time 30 s was used the subsequent study 3 4 surface charge and mechanical property of the dl pvdf hfms surface charge property has an important effect in the repulsion of charged solutes surface zeta potentials at different solution ph for dl pvdf loose nf hfm were shown in fig 11a the prepared dl pvdf loose nf hfm showed a negative charge characteristic over the ph range from 3 0 to 10 0 therefore this developed membrane could effectively separate the dye with negative charge via the electrostatic repulsion effect 20 fig 11b shows the mechanical properties of the neat pvdf hfm produced by tips dl pvdf hfms while fig 11c shows mechanical properties of the neat pvdf hfm made by nips the tensile strength and elongation for neat pvdf hfm made by nips was 4 7 mpa and 15 7 which is remarkably lower than that of the hfm manufactured via tips the porous matrix reinforced hfm used in this study had a high tensile strength of 15 0 mpa whereas the biggest elongation at break was 45 2 dl pvdf hollow uf fiber membrane without adding licl m 1 had an improved tensile strength 15 8 mpa and reduced strain at break 37 0 compared with the m 1 membrane dl pvdf hollow fiber uf membrane with 2 wt licl m 2 had an enhanced tensile strength at break of 17 0 mpa and a greater elongation of 39 3 it indicated that the introduction of licl into pvdf layer could improve mechanical properties of hollow fiber membrane which could explain that the addition of licl would form membrane with good porosity and interconnectivity and suppress the formation of macrovoids as expected dl pvdf hollow fiber nf membrane with 15 thf at evaporation time 30 s m 5 possessed excellent mechanical strengths of 17 7 mpa which favored its industrial applications the mechanical strength in this study was significantly higher than that reported in the literature 9 39 furthermore the m 5 membrane maintained a great tensile strain with 35 8 suggesting its good flexibility this was mainly due to the intrinsic structure characteristics of pvdf hollow fiber support tips on the other hand thf tuned pvdf separation layer which converted the finger like microvoid structure from tight structure verified from sem images thus strengthening the mechanical properties more detailed data on mechanical properties for the obtained membranes are provided in table 5 to sum up this excellent mechanical strength not only offered good flexibility to customize membrane separation performance but also produced high strength hfm for nf the stability of nf membrane is greatly significant for practical application thus we measured the pwf and solute rejection rate of dl loose nf hfm at different hydraulic pressures and the results are shown in fig 11d it was found that the pwf of the resultant nf hfm increased steadily with the growing of operating pressure 0 1 0 7 mpa while the trend slowed down with further increasing pressure to 1 0 mpa which indicated that the prepared membrane was relatively loose and was compacted after 0 8 mpa meanwhile the solute rejection of rb remained almost the same 100 generally dl hollow fiber loose nf membrane exhibited good stability under investigated operating pressure with high flux and dye rejection which could be attributed to its rigid structure small pore size and enhanced mechanical strength the results indicated the prepared nf membrane could run steadily for dye purification even under higher operating pressure 3 5 membrane separation properties 3 5 1 membrane filtration performance four single dyes with different charges and molecular weights were chosen to evaluate separation ability of the prepared dl pvdf loose nf hfm as shown in fig 12a as for negatively charged dyes the resultant negatively charged membranes have pretty high rejection 99 9 of rb mw 1017 da and ebt mw 461 da as a result of the steric hindrance and charge repulsion effect 44 as shown in fig 13 it could be seen that rb molecules were retained on the surface of the obtained loose nf hfm resulting in extremely high removal efficiency in addition we could clearly observe that rb molecules formed larger aggregates or clusters on the surface of the fouled nf hfm via hydrogen bonding and or hydrophobic interactions between their aromatic rings which were in agreement with previous studies 45 as a result the resultant loose nf membrane could effectively reject them via size exclusion the rejection of mo 93 8 was lower than that of rb and ebt due to that mo had lower molecular weight and its molecular chain was linear 46 nonetheless the rejection of mo was much higher than those of nf membranes from literature report for positively charged dye of mb the resultant loose nf membrane still exhibited remarkable removal efficiency 96 5 even though mb had lowest molecular weight in this study this impressive separation capability could be explained by the following two reasons 1 the obtained loose nf membrane had a denser separation layer with a small pore size which favored dye removal via size sieving and 2 the electrostatic attraction interaction between membrane surface and cationic dyes would block membrane pores and further shrink the pore diameter of selective layer 47 thus resulting in improved rejection as shown in fig s3 we could clearly observed that permeates were transparent for after filtrating rb and ebt solutions in addition compared with other dye solutions the prepared membrane had the lowest permeation flux in mb solution which was mainly due to more serious adsorption for cationic dyes 48 we further measured the different salt rejection as shown in fig 12b they followed the sequence of mgcl2 0 nacl 3 2 mgso4 4 7 na2so4 24 5 which conformed to typical separation behavior of negative charged nf membranes and was the result of the coaction of charge repulsion and size sieving 49 the membranes with negatively charge could exclude divalent anions so4 2 more effectively via electrostatic interactions than that to cl and thus the higher removal efficiency of sulfate salts compared to chloride salts 50 due to the fact that membranes have stronger affinity to mg2 than that of na 23 thus the retention of na2so4 was the highest while that of mgcl2 was the lowest more importantly low retentions for most salt 5 and high retentions 99 9 for dyes with larger molecular weight were achieved thus the dl pvdf loose nf hfm presented great potential in the fractionation of dyes and salts 3 5 2 separation performance in dye salt mixtures the effect of salt concentration on performance of dl pvdf loose nf hfm in dye salt filtration process were investigated as shown in fig 14a and b as the salt concentration increased from 1000 to 6000 mg l the permeability of the rb salt mixture declined slightly whereas the rejection of rb kept constant 99 9 and the rejections of salts remained low level 3 of nacl and 24 of na2so4 more importantly the retentions of nacl and na2so4 dropped to as low as 0 6 and 5 8 respectively when the salt concentration reached 6000 mg l and the rejection of rb was ultrahigh 99 9 which had a great potential to treat high salinity wastewater higher salt content could facilitate electrostatic shielding effect resulting in the decrease of salt rejections 51 however rb molecules could still be removed in this case steric hindrance mechanism played a dominant effect in rb exclusion besides the presence of salt caused the increase of osmotic pressure thus resulting in the decline of permeation flux at high salt concentration the results indicated that loose nf hfm with superior separation performance was expected to effectively treat textile wastewater table s2 presents the separation ability of the prepared loose nf hfm for processing dye nacl mixtures the obtained hfms exhibited excellent selectivity and high permeation flux 8 13 l m2 h bar fig 14c and d shows the effects of dye ebt and mb concentration on the performance of the prepared loose nf membrane the dye concentration was shown to have almost no effect on ebt removal over the entire study range whereas the rejection of mb declined from 96 5 to 94 0 when increasing mb concentration from 200 to 1000 mg l although the concentration of dye solution became high the resultant membrane still exhibited excellent rejection ability to ebt which may be due to the larger molecular weight of ebt than that of mb in contrast to ebt positively charged dye mb had a small molecular size so it was easy to adsorb on the surface of the membrane resulting in a decrease in mb removal as the increase of dye concentration the removal rate of nacl in ebt mixed solution slightly increased from 6 2 to 7 8 while that in mb mixed solution slightly decreased from 1 5 to 0 4 excitingly the rejection of nacl was below 10 for all study dye concentration besides the trend that the permeation flux decreased with increasing dye concentration was observed for both rb and mb dye solutions which was mainly due to that more dyes aggregated on membrane surface and formed a foulant layer to increase transport resistance for water permeation 52 in a word the resultant dl pvdf hollow fiber loose nf membrane exhibited a stable performance in a wide range of concentrations 3 5 3 stability and fouling resistance performance stability was another important property of nf membrane the stability of the optimized dl pvdf hollow fiber membrane in this study was evaluated during continuous filtration of 50 ppm dyes rb or ebt and 1000 ppm salt nacl solutions as model feed over a period of 48 h as shown in fig 15 the prepared membrane maintained over 99 9 rejection for rb fig 15a and ebt fig 15b during this continuous nf process as expected more than 93 of inorganic salts 97 for nacl in rb mixture solution and 93 for nacl in ebt mixture solution would permeate through the fibers during the 48 h tests meanwhile for two kinds of mixtures the permeability of membrane showed an obviously declining trend within first 10 h due to the formation of a resistive foulant layer and then kept stable 53 the results indicated the resultant loose nf membrane exhibited stable separation performance during a continuous nf process and further showed the potential the practical industrial application finally the fouling resistance was also evaluated by filtering rb and ebt as the fouling sources as shown in fig 15c it could be observed that when the feed solution di water was replaced by the model fouling solutions the permeation flux of the dl loose nf hfm decreased due to the deposition of foulants on the membrane surface the fouled fibers were rinsed periodically by water and related indexes were calculated to evaluate its fouling resistance as shown in fig 15d the frr values of dl loose nf membrane for rb and ebt dye solutions were 89 1 and 92 75 respectively which indicated that good flux recovery could be reached with simple water rinsing besides the rir values for two different dye solutions were below 11 in the best case the rir value for ebt was even as low as 7 25 the good fouling resistance could be ascribed to the following reasons the newly developed loose nf membrane had a denser separation layer with a small pore size which effectively prevented dye molecules from passing through the membrane the membranes prepared in this study had a relatively smooth surface which was beneficial to reduce the deposition of foulants and thus good flux recovery was achievable furthermore anti fouling capacity for ebt was higher than that of rb due to electrostatic repulsion effect in summary the dl pvdf hollow fiber membrane exhibited a superior separation performance good stability and fouling resistance indicating its huge potential for wastewater purification 3 5 4 performance comparison table 6 presents a performance comparison of dl pvdf loose nf hfm with recent commercial and loose nf membranes in the literature our prepared membrane exhibited higher pure water permeability with a satisfying dye salt selectivity to that of sepro nf 6 and sepro nf 2a for the reported loose nf membranes prepared by different methods blending phase inversion pi ip surface deposition and in situ growth they usually showed high water flux nevertheless the preparation processes usually require expensive raw materials and intricate synthesis procedures which could be challenging for the large volume fabrication of loose nf membrane compared with the above reported methods our preparation procedure is simple and cost effective the comparison was also done with hollow fiber loose nf membranes e g spsf pes based nf and pei torlon sppsu it was found that these membranes were modified through blending sulfonated polymer to obtain nf performances the results indicated that the dl pvdf loose nf hfm prepared in this work was more suitable for the separation and recovery of valuable resource in actual textile wastewater 4 conclusion the dl pvdf hollow fiber loose nf membrane was designed through a simple route for fractionation of dye salt mixtures by fine

13104,a dual layer dl pvdf loose nanofiltration nf hollow fiber membrane hfm with desirable properties was designed via phase inversion process using a continuous online coating device by fine tuning dope formulation and fiber formation the pvdf coating layer with nf separation capabilities was formed on the shell side of porous matrix reinforced hollow fiber support while making fiber continuously the effects of several parameters e g licl content co solvent ratio i e dmac thf and air bath distance evaporation time on structures and properties were investigated to manipulate membrane mwco it was found that the introduction of volatile co solvent and the control of evaporation time helped to significantly reduce the pvdf selective layer s thickness the structure along with performance of the hfm demonstrated the dl ultrafiltration uf hfm could be successfully converted into nf hfm only by adjusting the parameters in the production system after optimizing both phase inversion parameters and coating conditions the resultant loose nf hfm presented a low mwco of 1530 da and a high pure water flux pwf of 14 2 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 meanwhile the hfm showed competitive dyes rejection i e 99 9 for rose bengal and eriochrome black t 96 5 for methylene blue and low nacl rejection 3 2 furthermore the prepared membrane also presented good stability and high flux recovery during a continuous nf process this work provided a simple and economical strategy for engineering scalable loose nf hfm for dye purification graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords hollow fiber membrane loose nanofiltration dual layer membrane phase inversion dye salt separation 1 introduction synthetic dyes from textile wastewater which are toxic complex and difficult to degrade 1 large amount of dyes are discharged into surrounding water body which will bring threats to environment and human health 2 3 in addition the existence of inorganic salts na2so4 5 6 wt or nacl 6 wt increases the difficulty of biodegradation and purification 4 there are many traditional methods to treating textile wastewater such as adsorption 5 biological degradation 6 advanced oxidation 7 and precipitation 8 unfortunately these techniques have limitations that dyes and salts are not sufficiently recycled nanofiltration nf has shown great merits in wastewater treatment and dye purification owing to its advantages such as excellent selectivity and low energy cost 9 however conventional nf membranes present high rejection rates toward inorganic salts which increase the difficulty of dye and salt recovery thus limiting the practical application of nf in textile wastewater for example a commercial nf membrane i e sepro nf 2a has 99 6 rejection to congo red and 30 retention to nacl but with over 90 retention to na2so4 which reduces the separation efficiency for dye salt mixture 10 recently more and more attention has been drawn to the fabrication of loose nf membranes featuring high passages of salt without sacrificing dye retention which make them more suitable for dye salt separation several methods such as in situ growth on surface of hydrolyzed polyacrylonitrile pan 11 12 surface deposition from polyphenols e g dopamine da tannic acid ta and catechol 13 15 interfacial polymerization ip using new monomers e g meso erythritol me polyether amine pea and ta 2 4 16 blending phase inversion e g blending nanomaterials cerium oxide ceo2 halloysite nanotubes hnts and molybdenum disulfide mos2 1 17 18 have been proposed to fabricate the loose nf membrane these modified membranes showed high flux and good dye salt selectivity nevertheless these reported membranes are predominantly flat sheet membrane involving intricate synthesis procedures and expensive raw materials in membrane fabrication which largely restricted its large scale fabrication and application in textile wastewater comparing with flat sheet and spiral wound membrane loose nf membranes in the hollow fiber hf configuration have unique advantages such as self supporting structure great surface area per fiber large scale fabrication high packing density and good flexibility in operation 19 21 it may be pointed out that most of commercially available nf membranes were made by ip method on an ultrafiltration flat sheet membrane 19 22 in view of the difficulties of ip reaction on the shell side of fine hf the application of nf in hf configuration was largely restricted and there was no commercial application at present 21 23 phase inversion was not widely applied for the nf membrane because it was difficult to get an nf membrane with high salts rejection fortunately the membrane fabricated via phase inversion procedure seemed easier for producing loose nf membranes with a larger pore size which was favorable for treating textile wastewater 24 for instance thong et al 25 fabricated polyethersulfone pes loose nf hfm via blending sulfonated polysulfone spsf into spinning dope the prepared spsf pes membrane showed a relatively high pwf of 13 2 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 and a high dye rejections 94 9 han et al 22 developed pei torlon sppsu loose nf hfm via blending polyphenylenesulfone sppsu into torlon dope solution and then application of pei as the crosslinking agent to achieve nf performance the membrane exhibited high rejections of 95 5 99 9 to tested dyes and pwf of 16 3 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 whereas a low na2so4 rejection 10 nevertheless these membranes usually require blending or post treatment to realize loose nf performances phase inversion parameters e g co solvent ratio solvent type and additives etc were regulated to narrow the pore size and thus obtain loose nf membranes without the need to apply post treatments or make materials blend for instance huang et al 26 fabricated poly m phenylene isophthalamide pmia flat sheet membrane with nf performance by tuning dope formulation e g licl and polyvinyl pyrrolidone pvp the prepared membranes exhibited high rejections of 98 to tested dyes and low retention of 5 5 to nacl mertens et al 27 prepared poly vinylidene fluoride pvdf loose nf flat sheet membrane by tuning phase inversion parameters e g pvdf concentration n methyl 2 pyrrolidone nmp thf ratio and evaporation time the obtained pvdf membrane showed improved methyl orange 320 da retention of 80 but an extremely low permeability 1 8 l m2 h bar due to entire cross section structure of the membrane became tighter and they did not report the separation performance of dye salt mixtures although these membranes with performances in the nf range were predominantly flat sheet membranes this may provide an efficient strategy to prepare loose nf hollow membranes via tuning phase inversion parameters furthermore an ideal loose nf hollow fiber membrane structure should have a support layer with high mechanical strength and filtration reliability for operating in textile wastewater under high pressures and a separation layer with a nf range pore size for excellent dye salt selectivity and reasonably high porosity to maintain high water flux therefore it is vital to explore ways of developing composite hollow fiber membrane with nf separation capabilities and reinforced mechanical strength via simple scalable and cost effective procedure pvdf has been widely used for membrane preparation because it not only possesses inherent high stability good mechanical strength and high thermal stability but also is cheaper than polyimide pi and polybenzimidazole pbi 28 30 thus these outstanding physiochemical properties make it suitable for textile wastewater treatment pvdf hfm made via thermally induced phase separation tips technology has been demonstrated to provide high mechanical strength and permeation flux due to its bi continuous pore structures 31 for instance liu et al 32 prepared dual layer dl polyethersulfone pvdf pes pvdf hfm by producing pvdf inner layer in the tips method followed by forming pes outer layer in the phase inversion method the dl membrane exhibited excellent durability and improved separation performance in wastewater treatment but it failed to obtain nf property and need further interfacial polymerization to realize the transition from uf to loose nf membrane 33 in this study we propose a simple and scalable procedure for engineering dl pvdf hollow fiber membranes hfms with nf separation capabilities without post treatment or blending in this method loose nf hfms were designed by phase inversion process using self designed online coating device more specifically a commercially available porous matrix reinforced pvdf microfiltration mf hollow fiber membrane is used as a support by accurately tuning of the parameters involved in the dope formulation and fiber formation e g licl content co solvent ratio dmac thf and air bath distance the pvdf coating layer with nf separation capabilities was formed on the shell side of porous matrix reinforced hollow fiber support while making fiber continuously furthermore the structure along with performance of the hfm demonstrated that the dl uf hfm could be successfully converted into nf hfm only by adjusting the parameters in the production system the preparation procedure is facile cost effective scalable and without post treatment which favored large scale fabrication of low cost loose nf hfm this study may offer a strategy for economically advantageous and feasible fabrication of dl loose nf hfm for purification of dye wastewater 2 experimental 2 1 materials porous matrix reinforced pvdf hfm and pvdf powder were acquired from tianjin motimo co china the outer and internal diameters of the hfm average pore radius 45 nm pwf 823 l m2 h bar were approximately 1 0 mm and 0 6 mm respectively n n dimethylacetamide dmac tetrahydrofuran thf and acetone were acquired from tianjin kemiou chemical reagent co china methylene blue mb rose bengal rb methyl orange mo and eriochrome black t ebt were obtained from aladdin industrial co china the detailed information of these dyes was presented in table 1 lithium chloride licl and polyethylene glycol peg was supplied by macklin reagent china 2 2 preparation of the dl pvdf loose nf hfm a series of coating solutions consisted of pvdf dmac licl were obtained by adding pvdf powder into a well mixed dmac licl solution under stirring the content of pvdf was 22 wt and licl ranged between 0 and 3 wt licl was widely used pore forming agent to form uf membrane with excellent porosity and permeation flux 34 35 the coating solutions made of pvdf dmac thf licl were obtained by dissolving licl and pvdf with dmac and thf as the solvent and co solvent respectively and stirred overnight until a homogenous solution was obtained thf was added into coating solution because of its high volatility which facilitated the solvent to evaporate from the membrane surface before phase inversion in a coagulation bath 27 36 37 fig 1b shows the formation mechanism of dense skin layer the relative polymer concentration on the coating layer surface increased which would delay the solvent non solvent exchange rate and slow down the mass transfer rate thereby leading to further densification of the skin layer in addition the mixtures of dmac and thf with different weight ratios i e 100 0 0 thf 95 5 5 thf 85 15 15 thf 75 25 25 thf were set in this experiment air bubbles in solution were removed by degassing for 12 h in this work we first tuned licl content to appropriately reduce the pore size of dl hfm more importantly the addition of licl greatly increased the porosity of hfm and thus increases membrane flux next we tuned other parameters e g dmac thf ration and air bath distance to obtain a desired pore size the dl pvdf loose nf hfms were designed via phase inversion process using a self designed online coating device the detailed procedure for one step production of loose nf hfms was shown in fig 1 the above well mixed solutions were poured into a self designed coating device along the upper pipe wall the porous matrix reinforced hollow fiber passed through the pvdf solution vertically under a speed of 3 cm s and the fiber was continuously coated on the outer surface from spool to spool subsequently the coated hollow fiber entered the coagulation bath after passing through an air bath under the traction where the pvdf solution was converted into a thin selective layer via optimized phase inversion process air bath distance was also a key parameter to obtain separation layer with nf properties during the coating process different distances of air bath were set to control the evaporation time of the volatile co solvent before phase inversion in a coagulation bath the transition from uf to loose nf membrane could be easily realized by fine tuning of the dope formulation and fiber formation in the production system the coating formulation was displayed in table 2 and the prepared dl hollow fiber membranes at various parameters were listed in table 3 finally the bundled fibers were immersed in water container for one day and then immersed in a water glycerol 70 30 wt solution for two days to preserve hfm structures 2 3 characterizations of dl pvdf hfms morphologies of dl pvdf hfms were examined by desktop scanning electron microscope sem phenom xl netherlands and field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem regulus 8100 japan charge property of the hollow fiber surface was analyzed by an electrokinetic analyzer anton paar graz austria the mechanical properties were tested by electronic universal material testing machine ags x hongkong shimadzu corp china an effective length of between clamps was set to 2 5 cm the average values of five fibers were recorded pore size distribution and molecular weight cut off mwco of the resultant hfms were determined through filtrating neutral polyethylene glycol peg 200 ppm solutes a total organic carbon analyzer toc vcph shimadzu japan were performed to test the concentrations of pegs before cf ppm and after cp ppm filtration the rejection r of each solute was calculated from 1 r 1 c p c f 100 the solute stokes radius r s can be obtained based on the molecular weight mw of peg as following 38 2 r s 0 01673 m w 0 557 m w 35 000 when the r for peg was 90 the corresponding solute molecular weight is defined as mwco of hfm the pore size distribution of hfm was evaluated using eq 3 39 3 d r r p d r p 1 r p ln σ p 2 π exp ln r p ln μ p 2 2 ln σ p 2 where mean pore size μp nm is pore radius rp nm at which rejection rate is 50 the geometric standard deviation σp is defined as ratio of rp when rejection rate is 84 13 and 50 respectively 2 4 filtration performance of hfms filtration performance of hfms was evaluated via a lab scale cross flow device as shown in fig s1 all test modules were stabilized for 1 h under 0 5 mpa meanwhile salt and dye concentrations were examined using conductivity meter thermo scientific orion star belgium and uv vis spectrophotometer uv 1601 shimadzu japan respectively the flux j l m 2 h 1 bar 1 and rejection r was obtained from eqs 4 and 5

filtration would run continuously for 48 h filtration performance were detected the fouling resistance of the loose nf hfm was studied using rb and ebt solutions 50 ppm at 25 c 0 5 mpa the membrane was first filtrated with di water for 60 min and the pwf were tested every 10 min the filtrating feed solution was then replaced with the dye solutions for 60 min and the permeate flux was monitored during the filtration the fouled hfms were thoroughly rinsed with di water for 30 min again the pwf of the cleaned membrane was measured the index i e total pollution ft irreversible pollution fir

the formed pvdf separation layer was formed on the shell side of porous matrix reinforced hf mf membrane via phase inversion process using an online coating device the morphologies of neat pvdf mf membrane produced by tips method are shown in fig s2 such unique reinforced fiber was used as the support to make high strength hfm for uf and nf applications fig 2 shows the cross sections a b and d f and outer surface c of the dl pvdf loose nf hfm m 5 while fig 3 shows the outer surface a and cross sections b d of the dl pvdf uf hfm m 2 the obvious variation in the prepared dl pvdf loose nf membrane compared with dl pvdf uf membrane could be found the dl pvdf uf membrane had smooth and featureless outer surface with visible small pores fig 3a while the dl pvdf loose nf membrane had a rough surface with large pores fig 2c the porous outer surface should be the trace left by the volatilization of thf from membrane surface before entering the coagulant bath it should be noted that these pores do not transverse across the entire skin layer as shown in fig 2d f the cross sectional sem image in fig 2b and d showed that a homogenous and dense pvdf thin skin layer was coated on the reinforced pvdf hollow fiber support fig 2d was the enlarged cross section of fig 2b for clearer observation the dense pvdf selective layer was around 7 μm furthermore it could be clearly seen from fig 2d that the formed pvdf separation layer fitted closely with the underlying reinforced pvdf substrate due to the fact that good miscibility of the same polymer thus indicating delamination free dl pvdf loose nf membranes were obtained the delamination free structure was the most fundamental requirement for membrane separation performance during manufacturing dl membranes from immiscible polymers direct delamination of the separation layer and the support layer often occurs in the coagulation bath which greatly deteriorated membrane structural stability and selectivity the skin layer of m 2 membrane exhibited a common asymmetric structure in morphology i e finger like pores and spongy like structure as shown in fig 3b d in contrast the typical asymmetric structure was not observed on the cross sections of the prepared m 5 membrane fig 2d f the tight structure for m 5 membrane resulted from the synergistic effects of volatile co solvent thf and evaporation time see fig 1b 40 the skin layer structure could be easily changed by fine tuning dope formulation and fiber formation as shown later 3 1 2 effects of licl content on morphology of dl pvdf uf hfms licl had been widely used in the fabrication of polymer membranes 34 fig 4 presents the cross sectional morphologies of dl pvdf uf hfms prepared at different licl content 0 2 and 3 wt while pvdf concentrations was fixed at 22 wt as licl content increased the macrovoids decreased in the size and the sponge like structure increased due to the delayed demixing process caused by increased viscosity of the casting solution as shown in fig 4b3 d3 the results were consistent with the conclusions from reported literature 41 42 the addition of licl into the casting solution tended to increase viscosity of the system due to the complex of licl with solvent and or the interaction of licl and pvdf 35 43 this sponge like structure was helpful to provide small micropores for good selectivity as examined in the following sections besides the thicknesses of pvdf separation layers ranged from 20 to 22 μm 3 1 3 effects of thf content on morphology of dl pvdf loose nf hfms in order to obtain pvdf separation layer with denser structure thf was used as a volatile co solvent and added into coating solution for further tuning the phase inversion process fig 5 shows the cross sectional morphologies of the dl pvdf loose nf hfms fabricated at various thf content 0 5 15 25 where other parameters were fixed i e pvdf concentration 22 wt licl content 2 wt and air bath distance 90 cm as shown in fig 5a1 a3 a common asymmetric morphological structure consisting of varied types of structure i e finger like pores and spongy like structure could be clearly observed when only licl was added to the coating solution the denser pvdf separation layer was uniformly formed on the shell side of porous matrix reinforced hollow fiber support when the introduction of thf into pvdf coating solution and the results are shown in fig 5b1 d3 more importantly the cross sectional images show that when the air bath distance was fixed 90 cm evaporation time 30 s the pvdf separation layer was significantly thinner about 6 5 10 μm than that without thf 20 22 μm more detailed range values of pvdf separation layer s thickness at different parameters are listed in table s1 the results indicated the presence of thf helped to remarkably reduce the thickness of the pvdf separation layer when the thickness of the separation layer becomes thinner its structure became denser this may be due to that the thf solvent evaporated the pvdf separation layer was compacted and thus the membrane pores would shrink and became smaller resulting in a thinner and denser separation layer structure furthermore the enlarged cross sections and outer surfaces of the pvdf separation layer fabricated with various dmac thf ratio are also presented in fig 6 as shown in fig 6a1 the pvdf separation layer consisted of typical finger like pores and spongy like structure when the membrane prepared without thf interestingly we could clearly observe the transformation in membrane structure from finger like sponge like structure to interlocking network like structure as shown in fig 6b1 d1 clear comparisons between the membrane prepared with 5 thf fig 6b1 and the membrane prepared with 15 thf or 25 thf fig 6c1 d1 obtained from enlarged cross sectional images indicated that higher thf content resulted in tighter cross sectional structure the formation of tight cross sectional structure was helpful to provide low mwco and small mean pore size for excellent selectivity as examined in the following sections moreover the surface of dl loose nf hfm prepared with thf became rougher compared with the one prepared without thf as show in fig 6b2 d2 3 1 4 effects of air bath distance on morphology of dl pvdf hfms evaporation of thf before phase inversion in a water bath was the key to obtain dense structure if only thf was added without the evaporation step it was difficult to obtain a loose nf structure thus the membrane was further tuned with different air bath distance evaporation time fig 7 shows the cross sectional structures of the dl pvdf loose nf hfms fabricated at various air bath distance where other parameters were fixed i e pvdf concentration 22 wt licl content 2 wt and thf content 15 as shown in fig 7a2 c2 the thicknesses of outer layers were 17 7 6 and 7 6 μm for membrane with 0 30 and 60 s evaporation respectively it should be noted that when the addition of thf 15 without the evaporation step the pvdf separation layer s thickness was slightly reduced compared with that without thf with the increase of the evaporation time the pvdf separation layer s thickness obviously decreased which indicated the evaporation step could effectively reduce the thickness of the separation layer resulting in the formation of a thinner pvdf selective layer the result confirmed our above conjecture that the evaporation of thf would lead to a thinner pvdf separation layer with further extension of the evaporation time the change in thickness was not obvious furthermore clear comparisons between the membrane prepared with 0 s evaporation time fig 8a1 and the membrane prepared with 30 s or 60 s evaporation time fig 8b1 c1 obtained from enlarged cross sectional images indicated that evaporation step resulted in tighter cross sectional structure meanwhile the rough surface of selective layer could be observed with prolonging evaporation time as shown in fig 8b2 and c2 3 2 molecular weight cut off mwco and pore size of the dl pvdf hfms in order to further demonstrate the pvdf selective layer with nf separation capabilities we measured the pore size and mwco of dl loose nf hfms m 5 as shown in fig 9a this property of dl pvdf hollow fiber uf membrane m 2 was also examined for comparison as shown in fig 9b results shown that the prepared dl pvdf hollow fiber uf membrane had a larger pore size of 2 80 nm with wider pore size distribution and the corresponding mwco was 13 45 kda as expected the mean pore size was reduced from 2 80 nm to 1 32 nm with narrower pore size distribution by the formation of denser pvdf separation layer the denser separation layer contributed to reduce mwco of dl hfms which was consistent with sem observations it may be pointed out that most of the commercially available nf membranes have a low mwco below 500 da and smaller pore size below 1 nm which was not suitable for dyes and salts recovery applications due to higher rejection for inorganic salts 24 phase inversion was not widely applied for the nf membrane because it was difficult to get an nf membrane with high salts rejection fortunately the dl pvdf hollow fiber nf membrane fabricated via online phase inversion procedure seemed easier for producing loose nf membranes with a much larger mwco which was favorable for treating textile wastewater due to a complete rejection for dyes and low rejection to salts besides most of commercially available nf membranes were prepared by ip method and predominantly thin film composite tfc flat sheet membranes 19 in view of the difficulties of ip reaction on the shell side of fine hf the application of nf in hollow fiber configurations was largely restricted 21 23 interestingly this is the first attempt to apply an easy phase inversion process on the surface of porous matrix reinforced hollow fibers to make dual layer membrane for nf application fig 9c and d shows the pore size distribution and mwco of dl hfms prepared at different parameters i e dmac thf ratios and evaporation time while licl content was fixed at 2 wt on entire preparation process table 4 summarizes their mwco and mean pore diameter μp values the mean pore size was reduced from 1 45 to 1 28 nm and its pore size distribution became narrower with the increase of thf content ranging from 5 to 25 as shown in fig 9c thus the corresponding mwco dropped from 2640 to 1310 da which indicated the formed pvdf separation layer became denser with the increasing thf content with increase evaporation time from 0 to 30 s we could clearly observe that the mwco of the resultant membranes showed a significant descending tendency as shown in fig 9d compared with the hfm without evaporation step the hfm with evaporation time 30 s had a narrow pore size distribution and small pore size of 1 32 nm which indicated the evaporation step was the key to obtain membrane with pore size in the nf range these changes indicated that the dl uf hfm could be successfully converted into nf hfm only by adjusting the parameters in the production system the transformation in the properties i e mwco and mean pore size also explained that the change in performance of the dl pvdf hfms discussed below from uf into nf range the results were attributed that the application of thf in the coating solution would facilitate the evaporation of solvent from the surface of pvdf separation layer before entering the coagulant bath thus altering the phase inversion process of the system and resulting in further densification of the top skin layer 3 3 optimization of membrane performance fig 10a shows the influence of licl content on the performance of the resulting dl pvdf hfms as expected increasing the licl content from 0 to 2 wt resulted in an increase in pure water flux 8 6 to 42 8 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 and rejection to ebt 70 3 to 87 6 and mb 50 3 to 76 0 the further increasing licl content there were no significant changes in dyes rejection whereas the flux decreased slightly the application of licl would produce more sponge like structure for the prepared uf membrane fig 4 which was helpful to provide small micropores for good selectivity in addition the addition of licl into the coating solution tended to produce membranes with good porosity resulting in enhanced permeation performance 43 2 wt was chosen as the optimal licl content for the fabrication of uf membrane in view of a higher flux and improved rejection to dyes fig 10b represents the effect of volatile co solvent thf a key parameter on performance of dl pvdf loose nf hfms during an evaporation step 30 s when 5 thf was used as co solvent the pwf decreased from 42 8 to 16 5 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 while the rejection of ebt and mb increased from 87 6 to 99 9 and 76 0 to 94 0 respectively with increasing the thf content from 5 to 15 the pure water flux slightly declined from 16 5 to 14 2 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 while the rejection of mb was improved from 94 0 to 96 5 further increasing the thf content to 25 there was slight change on performance of dl pvdf loose nf hfm the performance data were consistent with the information from membrane morphologies and mwco 15 was chosen as the optimal thf content in view of the higher flux outstanding rejection to ebt 99 9 and mb 96 5 as the addition of thf without evaporation step was difficult to obtain target nf performance the evaporation step was the key to obtain loose nf membrane thus the effect of air bath distance evaporation time another key parameter on performance of dl pvdf loose nf hfms was explored where other parameters were fixed i e the licl content 2 wt and thf concentration 15 as shown in fig 10c the prepared hfm with 15 thf without evaporation step 0 s had a high pwf of 30 7 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 and rejection for ebt 99 2 whereas a low rejection for mb 85 0 due to its low molecular weight the rejections of mb were 96 5 and 97 0 for the prepared membranes with 30 and 60 s evaporation time respectively consequently 30 s was chosen as the optimal evaporation time as the higher water flux high rejection to dyes the structure along with performance of the hfm indicated that the dl uf hfm could be successfully converted into nf hfm by simply tuning phase inversion process in order to reach desirable separation performance i e competitive flux and rejection to dyes nf membrane fabricated with optimized parameters thf content 15 and evaporation time 30 s was used the subsequent study 3 4 surface charge and mechanical property of the dl pvdf hfms surface charge property has an important effect in the repulsion of charged solutes surface zeta potentials at different solution ph for dl pvdf loose nf hfm were shown in fig 11a the prepared dl pvdf loose nf hfm showed a negative charge characteristic over the ph range from 3 0 to 10 0 therefore this developed membrane could effectively separate the dye with negative charge via the electrostatic repulsion effect 20 fig 11b shows the mechanical properties of the neat pvdf hfm produced by tips dl pvdf hfms while fig 11c shows mechanical properties of the neat pvdf hfm made by nips the tensile strength and elongation for neat pvdf hfm made by nips was 4 7 mpa and 15 7 which is remarkably lower than that of the hfm manufactured via tips the porous matrix reinforced hfm used in this study had a high tensile strength of 15 0 mpa whereas the biggest elongation at break was 45 2 dl pvdf hollow uf fiber membrane without adding licl m 1 had an improved tensile strength 15 8 mpa and reduced strain at break 37 0 compared with the m 1 membrane dl pvdf hollow fiber uf membrane with 2 wt licl m 2 had an enhanced tensile strength at break of 17 0 mpa and a greater elongation of 39 3 it indicated that the introduction of licl into pvdf layer could improve mechanical properties of hollow fiber membrane which could explain that the addition of licl would form membrane with good porosity and interconnectivity and suppress the formation of macrovoids as expected dl pvdf hollow fiber nf membrane with 15 thf at evaporation time 30 s m 5 possessed excellent mechanical strengths of 17 7 mpa which favored its industrial applications the mechanical strength in this study was significantly higher than that reported in the literature 9 39 furthermore the m 5 membrane maintained a great tensile strain with 35 8 suggesting its good flexibility this was mainly due to the intrinsic structure characteristics of pvdf hollow fiber support tips on the other hand thf tuned pvdf separation layer which converted the finger like microvoid structure from tight structure verified from sem images thus strengthening the mechanical properties more detailed data on mechanical properties for the obtained membranes are provided in table 5 to sum up this excellent mechanical strength not only offered good flexibility to customize membrane separation performance but also produced high strength hfm for nf the stability of nf membrane is greatly significant for practical application thus we measured the pwf and solute rejection rate of dl loose nf hfm at different hydraulic pressures and the results are shown in fig 11d it was found that the pwf of the resultant nf hfm increased steadily with the growing of operating pressure 0 1 0 7 mpa while the trend slowed down with further increasing pressure to 1 0 mpa which indicated that the prepared membrane was relatively loose and was compacted after 0 8 mpa meanwhile the solute rejection of rb remained almost the same 100 generally dl hollow fiber loose nf membrane exhibited good stability under investigated operating pressure with high flux and dye rejection which could be attributed to its rigid structure small pore size and enhanced mechanical strength the results indicated the prepared nf membrane could run steadily for dye purification even under higher operating pressure 3 5 membrane separation properties 3 5 1 membrane filtration performance four single dyes with different charges and molecular weights were chosen to evaluate separation ability of the prepared dl pvdf loose nf hfm as shown in fig 12a as for negatively charged dyes the resultant negatively charged membranes have pretty high rejection 99 9 of rb mw 1017 da and ebt mw 461 da as a result of the steric hindrance and charge repulsion effect 44 as shown in fig 13 it could be seen that rb molecules were retained on the surface of the obtained loose nf hfm resulting in extremely high removal efficiency in addition we could clearly observe that rb molecules formed larger aggregates or clusters on the surface of the fouled nf hfm via hydrogen bonding and or hydrophobic interactions between their aromatic rings which were in agreement with previous studies 45 as a result the resultant loose nf membrane could effectively reject them via size exclusion the rejection of mo 93 8 was lower than that of rb and ebt due to that mo had lower molecular weight and its molecular chain was linear 46 nonetheless the rejection of mo was much higher than those of nf membranes from literature report for positively charged dye of mb the resultant loose nf membrane still exhibited remarkable removal efficiency 96 5 even though mb had lowest molecular weight in this study this impressive separation capability could be explained by the following two reasons 1 the obtained loose nf membrane had a denser separation layer with a small pore size which favored dye removal via size sieving and 2 the electrostatic attraction interaction between membrane surface and cationic dyes would block membrane pores and further shrink the pore diameter of selective layer 47 thus resulting in improved rejection as shown in fig s3 we could clearly observed that permeates were transparent for after filtrating rb and ebt solutions in addition compared with other dye solutions the prepared membrane had the lowest permeation flux in mb solution which was mainly due to more serious adsorption for cationic dyes 48 we further measured the different salt rejection as shown in fig 12b they followed the sequence of mgcl2 0 nacl 3 2 mgso4 4 7 na2so4 24 5 which conformed to typical separation behavior of negative charged nf membranes and was the result of the coaction of charge repulsion and size sieving 49 the membranes with negatively charge could exclude divalent anions so4 2 more effectively via electrostatic interactions than that to cl and thus the higher removal efficiency of sulfate salts compared to chloride salts 50 due to the fact that membranes have stronger affinity to mg2 than that of na 23 thus the retention of na2so4 was the highest while that of mgcl2 was the lowest more importantly low retentions for most salt 5 and high retentions 99 9 for dyes with larger molecular weight were achieved thus the dl pvdf loose nf hfm presented great potential in the fractionation of dyes and salts 3 5 2 separation performance in dye salt mixtures the effect of salt concentration on performance of dl pvdf loose nf hfm in dye salt filtration process were investigated as shown in fig 14a and b as the salt concentration increased from 1000 to 6000 mg l the permeability of the rb salt mixture declined slightly whereas the rejection of rb kept constant 99 9 and the rejections of salts remained low level 3 of nacl and 24 of na2so4 more importantly the retentions of nacl and na2so4 dropped to as low as 0 6 and 5 8 respectively when the salt concentration reached 6000 mg l and the rejection of rb was ultrahigh 99 9 which had a great potential to treat high salinity wastewater higher salt content could facilitate electrostatic shielding effect resulting in the decrease of salt rejections 51 however rb molecules could still be removed in this case steric hindrance mechanism played a dominant effect in rb exclusion besides the presence of salt caused the increase of osmotic pressure thus resulting in the decline of permeation flux at high salt concentration the results indicated that loose nf hfm with superior separation performance was expected to effectively treat textile wastewater table s2 presents the separation ability of the prepared loose nf hfm for processing dye nacl mixtures the obtained hfms exhibited excellent selectivity and high permeation flux 8 13 l m2 h bar fig 14c and d shows the effects of dye ebt and mb concentration on the performance of the prepared loose nf membrane the dye concentration was shown to have almost no effect on ebt removal over the entire study range whereas the rejection of mb declined from 96 5 to 94 0 when increasing mb concentration from 200 to 1000 mg l although the concentration of dye solution became high the resultant membrane still exhibited excellent rejection ability to ebt which may be due to the larger molecular weight of ebt than that of mb in contrast to ebt positively charged dye mb had a small molecular size so it was easy to adsorb on the surface of the membrane resulting in a decrease in mb removal as the increase of dye concentration the removal rate of nacl in ebt mixed solution slightly increased from 6 2 to 7 8 while that in mb mixed solution slightly decreased from 1 5 to 0 4 excitingly the rejection of nacl was below 10 for all study dye concentration besides the trend that the permeation flux decreased with increasing dye concentration was observed for both rb and mb dye solutions which was mainly due to that more dyes aggregated on membrane surface and formed a foulant layer to increase transport resistance for water permeation 52 in a word the resultant dl pvdf hollow fiber loose nf membrane exhibited a stable performance in a wide range of concentrations 3 5 3 stability and fouling resistance performance stability was another important property of nf membrane the stability of the optimized dl pvdf hollow fiber membrane in this study was evaluated during continuous filtration of 50 ppm dyes rb or ebt and 1000 ppm salt nacl solutions as model feed over a period of 48 h as shown in fig 15 the prepared membrane maintained over 99 9 rejection for rb fig 15a and ebt fig 15b during this continuous nf process as expected more than 93 of inorganic salts 97 for nacl in rb mixture solution and 93 for nacl in ebt mixture solution would permeate through the fibers during the 48 h tests meanwhile for two kinds of mixtures the permeability of membrane showed an obviously declining trend within first 10 h due to the formation of a resistive foulant layer and then kept stable 53 the results indicated the resultant loose nf membrane exhibited stable separation performance during a continuous nf process and further showed the potential the practical industrial application finally the fouling resistance was also evaluated by filtering rb and ebt as the fouling sources as shown in fig 15c it could be observed that when the feed solution di water was replaced by the model fouling solutions the permeation flux of the dl loose nf hfm decreased due to the deposition of foulants on the membrane surface the fouled fibers were rinsed periodically by water and related indexes were calculated to evaluate its fouling resistance as shown in fig 15d the frr values of dl loose nf membrane for rb and ebt dye solutions were 89 1 and 92 75 respectively which indicated that good flux recovery could be reached with simple water rinsing besides the rir values for two different dye solutions were below 11 in the best case the rir value for ebt was even as low as 7 25 the good fouling resistance could be ascribed to the following reasons the newly developed loose nf membrane had a denser separation layer with a small pore size which effectively prevented dye molecules from passing through the membrane the membranes prepared in this study had a relatively smooth surface which was beneficial to reduce the deposition of foulants and thus good flux recovery was achievable furthermore anti fouling capacity for ebt was higher than that of rb due to electrostatic repulsion effect in summary the dl pvdf hollow fiber membrane exhibited a superior separation performance good stability and fouling resistance indicating its huge potential for wastewater purification 3 5 4 performance comparison table 6 presents a performance comparison of dl pvdf loose nf hfm with recent commercial and loose nf membranes in the literature our prepared membrane exhibited higher pure water permeability with a satisfying dye salt selectivity to that of sepro nf 6 and sepro nf 2a for the reported loose nf membranes prepared by different methods blending phase inversion pi ip surface deposition and in situ growth they usually showed high water flux nevertheless the preparation processes usually require expensive raw materials and intricate synthesis procedures which could be challenging for the large volume fabrication of loose nf membrane compared with the above reported methods our preparation procedure is simple and cost effective the comparison was also done with hollow fiber loose nf membranes e g spsf pes based nf and pei torlon sppsu it was found that these membranes were modified through blending sulfonated polymer to obtain nf performances the results indicated that the dl pvdf loose nf hfm prepared in this work was more suitable for the separation and recovery of valuable resource in actual textile wastewater 4 conclusion the dl pvdf hollow fiber loose nf membrane was designed through a simple route for fractionation of dye salt mixtures by fine
