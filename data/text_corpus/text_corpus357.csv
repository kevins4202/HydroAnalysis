1785,in order to improve the flood forecasting accuracy and reflect the forecast uncertainty information in the three gorges reservoir tgr interval basin in china this study integrates the feature and temporal dual attention da mechanism and recursive encoder decoder red structure into the long short term memory lstm neural network to develop a da lstm red model the feature attention acts on the input variables of the encoder and the temporal attention mechanism acts on the hidden layer states extracted by the lstm neural network during encoding process prompting the proposed model to extract critical input information among different types and moments of input variables to improve the multi step ahead flood forecasting accuracy second the copula based hydrological uncertainty processor copula hup is used to quantify the forecast uncertainty of the proposed model meanwhile creating multi step ahead flood probabilistic forecasts combining the long term 6 h hydrologic data series of the xiangjiaba tgr interval basin and the forecasted precipitation from the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf the effectiveness of the proposed model the effect of forecast precipitation on multi step ahead flood forecasting and the effect of different copula functions on the probabilistic forecast of copula hup are investigated respectively the results show that the da lstm red model can effectively improve the forecasting accuracy for long forecast horizons 3 7d compared to the lstm red model and the average absolute error metrics are reduced by 10 17 meanwhile the proposed model can identify input variables with a high correlation with the target output variables which improves the interpretability of deep learning to a certain extent the student copula hup has the lowest rb and crps metrics than the frank and gaussian copula hup which can better quantify the da lstm red model s forecast uncertainty therefore combining the proposed model with the student copula hup can effectively reduce the forecasting uncertainty enhance the forecasting reliability and accuracy for future horizons and provide reliable risk information for the tgr flood control scheduling decision keywords dual attention mechanism encoder decoder deep learning hydrological uncertainty processor copula function probabilistic forecasting data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction the construction of reservoirs has changed the runoff generation and flow confluence conditions in the interval basins of reservoirs which makes the rainfall runoff conversion law gradually change e g the xiangjiaba three gorges reservoir interval basin and has a growing impact on reservoir inflow forecasting xue et al 2021 the interval basin of reservoirs usually has complex inflow situations which are challenging to model and highly uncertain the interval basin s range generally includes the basin boundary between the upstream reservoir dam or interval tributary control stations and the downstream reservoir dam the flow production and confluence of the interval basin directly influences the flood magnitude of the downstream reservoir therefore the accurate and reliable flood forecasting is vital for reservoir flood control and scheduling decision zhou et al 2019 however many factors affect the accuracy of interval flood forecasts such as the discharge flow for upstream mainstream and tributary reservoir scheduling decisions the distribution characteristics of precipitation intensity in the interval basin and the changing basin subsurface characteristics which make it difficult to obtain the characteristic parameters or observation data of the interval basin cho and kim 2022 the process based hydrological models and data driven models are usually used to simulate rainfall and runoff transformation processes liu et al 2022a liu et al 2022b the former adopts empirical formulas to approximate the physical mechanism of the rainfall runoff relationship which follows the principle of mass conservation and has strong interpretability cui et al 2021 however the process based hydrological model usually requires many parameters and data types chen et al 2022 meanwhile with the enhanced impact of human activities and climate change it is difficult for process based hydrological models to simulate runoff generation processes under changing environments yang et al 2019 the data driven model based on finding the association between forecast factors and target outputs from the big dataset is easy to model and apply in practice however it does not consider physical causal mechanisms and has difficulty in explaining the relationship between inputs and outputs resulting in low confidence and interpretability young et al 2017 in recent years as artificial intelligence techniques develop rapidly many advanced deep learning models suitable for dealing with nonlinear time series forecasting problems have emerged konapala et al 2020 granata et al 2022 and gradually improved the forecasting accuracy and interpretability of data driven models kao et al 2021 cui et al 2022 among them the long short term memory lstm neural network is one of the most representative models and is a special kind of recurrent neural network which overcomes the gradient explosion or disappearance problem hochreiter schmidhuber 1997 kratzert et al 2018 apaydin et al 2021 the recurrent structure within the lstm model can handle the connection between input and output variables in the temporal dimension gao et al 2020 some hydrologists have shown high research interest in lstm models for multi step ahead flood forecasting for example kao et al 2021 proposed a novel sae rnn model that combined the stacked autoencoder saes with the lstm neural network and found that it could obtain accurate and reliable multi step ahead inundation forecasts hunt et al 2022 trained the lstm model by meteorological and hydrological dataset from era5 and glofas era5 reanalyzes and historical streamflow series constructed a hybrid forecasting system combining physics based methods with statistical methods and found that the lstm models had the best medium term forecasting performance and broad application prospects with the emergence of the recursive encoder decoder red structure that can handle sequence to sequence problems cho et al 2014 sutskever et al 2014 the lstm lstm red model based on the red structure has attracted widespread attention kao et al 2020 han et al 2021 cui et al 2022 xiang et al 2020 ha et al 2021 different from the single output lstm model the lstm red model can convey the effective features extracted in the previous moment to the later moment in the encoding and decoding process xiang demir 2020 yin et al 2021 which can rapidly obtain the multi step ahead flood forecasting while considering the connection between the outputs of adjacent forecast horizons with high internal interpretability and applicability kao et al 2020 most studies focus on closed basins where runoff is mainly generated from precipitation however there are more factors affecting flood forecasting in the interval basins of reservoirs and reasonable dealing with the complex input factors in the lstm red model becomes the key to improving multi step ahead flood forecasting accuracy in recent years the attention mechanism has attracted much attention from scholars in time series forecasting problems due to properties such as feature interpretability alizadeh et al 2021 the attention mechanism is a resource allocation approach to solve the information redundancy problem in deep learning which can assist models in identifying and highlighting more critical information by assigning weights bahdanau et al 2014 luong et al 2015 etc thus improving the forecasting performance of the models among them the feature and temporal attentions are common attention mechanisms in the study of lstm neural networks the feature attention mechanism adaptively highlights the critical input variables by assigning weights to the input feature variables noor et al 2022 zhang et al 2022 the temporal attention mechanism acts on the effective information hidden layer states extracted by the lstm neural network at each time step by assigning weights to highlight the information extracted at key time steps in the temporal dimension girihagama et al 2022 yan et al 2021 to improve the ability of lstm neural networks to handle complex input variables and to achieve the identification of critical factors among different categories and moments of input variables qin et al 2017 coupled both feature and temporal dual attention da mechanisms to lstm neural networks and applied to temperature and stock prediction problems subsequently the da mechanism has gradually been applied to time series forecasting problems in transportation finance meteorology energy etc qin et al 2017 kim et al 2021 fan et al 2021 de medrano and aznarte 2020 ding et al 2020 introduced the da mechanism to lstm neural network for runoff forecasting and achieved the best forecast performance in three closed basins in the interval basins of reservoirs adopting the feature and temporal dual attention mechanism for weighting multiple input variables i e extracting effective information from the flow of mainstream and tributary control stations and interval production flow at different moments may be beneficial to improve the forecast accuracy and increase the model interpretability flood forecasting in the reservoir interval basin is usually subject to high uncertainty due to complex external inputs model structure and parameters raftery et al 2005 madadgar and moradkhani 2014 zhou et al 2020 the creation of the forecast intervals by probabilistic post processing techniques such as the hydrologic uncertainty processor hup is one of the effective methods to quantify uncertainty in hydrologic forecasts and widely used to supplement uncertainty information beyond point estimates zhou et al 2022 the hup method is proposed by krzysztofowicz kelly 2000 and uses the normal quantile transformation method to adapt to the non linear and non normal characteristics of the runoff series however the normal quantile transformation process is tedious complicated and prone to computational errors liu et al 2016 to avoids the normal quantile conversion process and improves the applicability of the hup method liu et al 2016 have modified the hup method based on the copula function i e copula hup hydrological probabilistic post processing of the raw forecast results using the hup method can provide additional risk information for water resources management decisions such as reservoir flood control and scheduling todini 2008 which plays a vital role in improving the reliability and value of incoming flood forecasts although the attention mechanism and hup method have been demonstrated to improve the accuracy of flood forecasting and quantify the forecast uncertainty there are still issues to be explored which can motivate the current study and form the research objectives 1 most studies on lstm neural networks coupled with the da mechanism focus on deterministic forecasting with a single output structure to the authors knowledge there is little research to couple the da mechanism with red structure based deep learning to explore multi step ahead flood probabilistic forecasting which needs further enriching the related theories and modelling methods 2 most studies on the lstm red model focus on the forecast performance with short forecast horizons or less than 10 time steps the precipitation forecasting information is not considered in the decoding process which cannot meet the demand for multi temporal flood process forecasting in practical operations liu et al 2022a liu et al 2022b 3 the copula hup does not consider the effects of different types of copula functions e g elliptic copula functions on the probabilistic forecasting performance the aims of this study are first to propose a novel da lstm red model that can visualize the importance of the input variables with different types and moments which can improve the interpretability of the deep learning and couple the forecasted precipitation from the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf for multi step ahead flood forecasting which is significant to meet demands of practical operations secondly a framework for multi step ahead flood probabilistic forecasting based on deep learning and the copula hup is proposed i e adopting the copula based hup to quantify the forecast uncertainty of the proposed model and the optimal probabilistic forecasting framework under different copula functions is explored in order to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method this study utilizes an inflow series of the three gorges reservoir tgr in china as a case study the rest of the paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the methods the case study and materials are introduced in section 3 section 4 evaluates and analyses the results section 5 discusses the advantages and interpretability of the proposed model conclusions and outlook are given in section 6 2 methods this study proposes a da lstm red model and verifies its effectiveness by taking the lstm red model as the benchmark model the hup method based on the copula function is used to quantify the forecast uncertainty of the proposed model the methods adopted in this study are briefly described as follows 2 1 dual attention mechanism based deep learning model this study couples the feature temporal dual attention da mechanism and recursive encoder decoder red structure to an lstm neural network proposes the da lstm red model and expects that it can effectively handle the complex and numerous input variables and improve the accuracy of multi step ahead flood forecasting in the interval basin of reservoirs the long short term memory lstm red neural network based on a recursive encoder decoder structure is used for multi step ahead flood forecasting the lstm neural network consists of four computational modules forgetting gate input gate memory unit state updating and output gate hochreiter schmidhuber 1997 the forgetting gate can filter out the unimportant information among the previous information the input gate can select useful information from the input the memory unit state which can store long term dependent information is updated by the forgetting and input gates the output gate can select and output useful information in the memory unit state the parameters of the lstm neural network e g weights and biases will be updated according to the loss function in the back propagation algorithm apaydin et al 2021 generally the hyperparameters composing the neural network structure have a relatively high impact on forecasting efficiency and performance because they directly affect the internal computational process of the neural network this type of hyperparameter mainly includes the number of hidden layers number of neurons dropout etc gao et al 2020 li et al 2021 a detailed description of the lstm neural network can be found in the literature by kratzert et al 2018 the recursive encoder decoder red structure is similar to that studied by kao et al 2020 and mainly consists of two calculation processes encoding and decoding processes the encoding process is used to extract the key information ct of the input variables in the decoding process ct and the output of the hidden layer at the previous moment are used as the input of the neural network at the latter moment through a recursive feedback input strategy the input to the neural network at the first moment of the decoding process is the observed flow corresponding to the forecast basis time in order to explore the influence of forecast information on the forecast accuracy of the multi temporal output of the lstm red model forecast information of the same input category as the encoding process is input in the decoding process in order to extract effective information from different types and moments of input variables and improve the forecast accuracy a feature temporal dual attention mechanism is introduced based on the lstm red model and the da lstm red model is proposed the dual attention mechanism of the proposed model can be divided into three parts feature attention module fig 1 a 1 temporal attention module fig 1 a 2 and forecast information processing module for the decoding process fig 1 b 1 1 feature attention module the feature attention module acts on the input variables of the encoding process the calculation principle is as follows qin et al 2017 1 r z r z 1 r z 2 r z k v r tanh w h r h z 1 e w c r c z 1 e w x r x e z 1 m 2 α z l e x p r z l i 1 k e x p r z i l 1 k 3 α z α z 1 α z 2 α z k 4 x z e x z e 1 x z e 2 x z e k α z x z e α z 1 x z e 1 α z 2 x z e 2 α z k x z e k where xe is the input variable for the encoding process x e x 1 e 1 x m e 1 x 1 e k x m e k w is the internal weight parameter of the neural network m is the number of input time steps for the encoding process k is the number of input variable types α is the weight of the input variable r is the transition variable in the calculation process x is the input variable after weighting by the feature attention module as shown by eq 1 and fig 1 a 1 the weights of the input variables are closely related to the hidden layer output at the previous moment of the encoding process which allows the model to adaptively highlight useful input variables during the training process 2 temporal attention module the temporal attention module acts on the hidden layer state of the encoding process output the calculation principle is as follows qin et al 2017 5 p t p t 1 p t 2 p t m h t 1 d w h p h e t 1 n 6 β t z e x p p t z j 1 m e x p p t j 7 β t β t 1 β t 2 β t m 8 h e h 1 e h 2 e h m e β t h e β t 1 h 1 e β t 2 h 2 e β t m h m e 9 c t i 1 m h i e where h e is the hidden layer state of the lstm neural network output during the encoding process h e h 1 e h 2 e h m e n is the maximum forecast horizon β is the temporal weight of the hidden layer state h is the hidden layer state after weighting by the temporal attention module ct is the effective information extracted by the corresponding encoding process in the t th forecast horizon from eq 5 and fig 1 a 2 it is observed that the effective information ct extracted by the encoding process is closely related to the state of the hidden layer at the previous forecast horizon of the decoding process therefore the effective information ct input in each forecast horizon of the decoding process can change adaptively 3 forecast information processing module in the decoding process the da lstm red model inputs the same type of forecast information as the encoding process in the decoding process and assigns weights to the forecast information to highlight the key forecast input variables first the input variable weights α in the feature attention module are averaged by time dimension i e the input variable weights α are multiplied by the temporal weights β to obtain the integrated weights α secondly the integrated weights α are multiplied with the forecast input of the decoding process in the t th forecast horizon finally a new forecast input highlighting the key information is obtained which is calculated as follows 10 α l i 1 m α i l β t i 11 α α 1 α 2 α k 12 x t d x t d 1 x t d 2 x t d k α x t d α 1 x t d 1 α 2 x t d 2 α k x t d k where x t d is the forecast input to the decoding process in the t th forecast horizon x t d x t d 1 x t d 2 x t d k x t d is the new forecast input after the integrated weight calculation the benchmark model is the lstm neural network with coupled red structure lstm red the validity of the proposed model will be verified in subsection 4 the input and output data of the above neural network are processed by the normalization method the trial and error method is often used to select the hyperparameters with a high impact on the structure of the lstm neural network mainly including the number of hidden layers the number of neurons and the dropout among them the range of the hidden layers is 1 5 with the interval of 1 the range of the number of neurons is 16 128 with the interval of 16 the dropout rate is in the range of 0 1 0 01 0 001 set the number of hidden layers and neurons of the encoding and decoding processes to be consistent similar to zhou 2020 gao et al 2020 li et al 2021 and apaydin et al 2021 the maximum epoch batch size and learning rate are set to 500 100 and 0 001 for both models respectively the early stopping method dynamically controls the epoch to prevent overfitting during training and the early patience is set to 80 the mean square error function is used for the loss function the model is trained by the adam method in tensorflow keras optimizers database of the python 3 7 software 2 2 copula based flood probabilistic forecasts based on bayesian principles the hydrological uncertainty processor hup can perform uncertainty analysis under the forecast value and the observed flow at the forecast basis moment krzysztofowicz and kelly 2000 which can be well interfaced with existing forecasting systems and has a broad application prospect its principle is as follows 13 p q o q f q b p q f q o q b p q o q b p q f q o q b p q o q b d q o where qo qb and qf are the observed flow the observed flow at the moment of forecast basis and the forecast flow respectively p denotes the probability density function pdf p q o q b p q f q o q b and p q o q f q b are the prior likelihood and posterior density functions respectively which are all conditional density functions in essence the hup method assumes that the data series obeys the normal distribution and requires converting the flow data series to gaussian space with the help of normal quantile transformation after obtaining the posterior distribution function it needs to use the jacobian inverse transformation to the original space which is a tedious and complicated process and easily produces errors affecting the applicability of the hup method since the copula function can flexibly construct the joint distribution function of multiple variables with arbitrary marginal distribution sklar 1959 liu et al 2016 proposed the copula based hup copula hup which can avoid the assumption of normal distribution the principle of the copula hup method is described as follows based on the copula function the prior cumulative distribution function cdf and pdf can be derived as follows liu et al 2016 14 p q o q b c 2 p q o p q b p q b 15 p q o q b dp q o q b d q o 2 c 2 p q o p q b p q o p q b d p q o d q o c 2 p q o p q b p q o where p denotes the cdf c 2 and c k denote the k dimensional copula density and distribution functions respectively the likelihood cdf and pdf can be derived as follows liu et al 2016 16 p q f q o q b 2 c 3 p q o p q f p q b p q o p q b c 2 p q o p q b 17 p q f q o q b d p q f q o q b d q f 1 c 2 p q o p q b 3 c 3 p q o p q f p q b p q o p q f p q b dp q f d q f c 3 p q o p q f p q b c 2 p q o p q b p q f taking eqs 15 and 17 into eq 13 the expression of the posterior pdf for the copula hup method is obtained liu et al 2016 18 p q o q f q b c 3 p q o p q f p q b 0 1 c 3 p q o p q f p q b d p q o p q o this study uses forecast intervals with a 90 confidence level to quantify forecast uncertainty the expression of 0 1 c 3 p q o p q f p q b d p q o is unable to be estimated directly and can be approximated by a monte carlo sampling method liu et al 2016 before constructing the equation 18 it is usually necessary to select the marginal distribution and the copula function the study intends to fit the preferred marginal distribution based on the kolmogorov smirnov ks test and the root mean square error rmse criterion from five distribution functions commonly used in the statistical hydrology such as pearson type iii p iii gamma normal lognormal and weibull liu et al 2016 chen et al 2012 the distribution function with the smallest rmse value is preferably selected as the theoretical distribution of the series based on passing the ks test and the parameters are estimated using the maximum likelihood method to explore the effect of copula functions on the probabilistic forecast performance of the hup method it is prepared to fit preferences from three commonly archimedean copulas gumbel hougaard frank and clayton copula and two elliptic copulas student t or student and gaussian copula functions based on ks test and root mean square error rmse criterion xiong et al 2019 furthermore several copula functions that pass the ks test and have relatively small rmse values will be selected to construct the hup method the expressions of gumbel hougaard frank and clayton copula functions can be referred to liu et al 2016 and the expressions of student and gaussian copula functions can be referred to chen et al 2013 2 3 evaluation metrics 1 deterministic evaluation metrics the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse metric is one of the most important and common metrics in hydrological forecasting which can indicate the fitting performance of the forecasted and the observed flows nash sutcliffe 1970 for the operation and scheduling of a large storage reservoir the accurate runoff volume forecast is more important than the peak discharge so the relative error of the total runoff re metric is chosen the mean absolute error mae metric can indicate the forecast error for each moment most importantly it can be compared with the probabilistic forecast metric i e the continuous ranked probability score crps raftery et al 2005 therefore the nse re and mae metrics are selected as deterministic forecast evaluation metrics 19 nse 1 i 1 n q o i q f i 2 i 1 n q o i q o 2 20 re i 1 n q f i i 1 n q o i i 1 n q o i 100 21 mae 1 n i 1 n q o i q f i where n is the sample number q o and q f denote the average of the observed and forecast flow respectively 2 probabilistic evaluation metrics the average coverage rate cr and the average relative bandwidth rb are the most common metrics to evaluate the performance of forecast intervals li et al 2021 the higher the cr value the more reliable the forecast interval the lower the rb value the lower the forecast uncertainty however xiong et al 2009 found that as the cr increases the rb value of the confidence interval also increases making it difficult to assess the performance of the forecast interval directly therefore the composite metric i e the percentage of observations bracketed by the unit confidence interval puci is used to evaluate the overall performance of the forecast interval the higher the puci value the lower the forecast uncertainty the crps is a composite index to evaluate the overall performance of probabilistic forecasts raftery et al 2005 representing both the reliability and sharpness of probabilistic forecasts the lower the crps value the better the overall performance of probabilistic forecasts and the better the fitting of the actual posterior distribution therefore the cr rb puci and crps are selected as probabilistic forecast evaluation metrics 22 cr n c n 23 rb 1 n i 1 n q u i q l i q o i 24 puci cr rb 25 crps 1 n i 1 n 0 p i r i r q o i 2 d r 26 i r q o i 1 r q o i 0 r q o i where i is the indicative function r is the flow variable nc is the number of qo within the forecast interval qu and ql are the upper and lower quartiles of the forecast interval respectively 3 case study and materials 3 1 study basin three gorges reservoir tgr is one of the largest hydraulic projects in the world undertaking a series of important tasks such as flood control power generation shipping and ecology zhong et al 2020 the tgr dam is located in sandouping yichang city hubei province china and controls a catchment area of about 1 million km2 with the annual mean flow discharge about 14 300 m3 s and the runoff about 451 billion m3 the normal storage water level of tgr is 175 m with the total storage capacity of about 39 3 billion m3 and the flood control capacity of about 22 15 billion m3 the length of the river under the normal storage water level of the reservoir is about 600 km with the average width of only 1 1 km and a wide backwater range which is a typical river type reservoir with the storage capacity coefficient of less than 4 the interval basin between xiangjiaba and tgr includes the basin between the control sites of the jinsha min tuo jialing and wu rivers in the upper reaches of the yangtze river whose runoff generation and flow concentration directly affect the inflow of the tgr the area of the interval basin is about 127 400 km2 accounting for about 13 of the tgr control area fig 2 shows the schematic diagram of the hydrologic control stations and rainfall stations from xiangjiaba to tgr interval basin the inflow of the tgr consists of the outflow discharge from the xiangjiaba reservoir the inflow of several tributaries such as min tuo jialing and wu rivers and the rainfall in the interval basin among them the runoff from the mainstream jinsha river and tributaries into the river network occupies a larger proportion of the total inflow which has a relatively significant impact on the tgr inflow the narrow river channel leads to a rapid increase in reservoir water level in addition the uncertainty of precipitation intensity and center location and the different propagation times of flow from mainstream and tributaries lead to differences in the impact of flow from different sources and moments on the tgr inflow these factors make flood forecasting in tgr always a significant challenge the flow propagation time from the mainstream and tributary hydrologic control stations to the tgr dam is shown in table 1 considering the uneven rainfall distribution due to the long and narrow interval basin the interval basin is divided into three sub basins pingshan cuntan cuntan wanxian and wanxian tgr dam site table 2 shows the information on sub basin area and rainfall station number in which 45 38 and 60 rainfall stations are located in these three sub basins respectively 3 2 study data materials the outflow discharge of xiangjiaba reservoir is observed at the pingshan hydrologic station as the mainstream flow the flow discharge from large tributaries min jialing tuo and wu rivers are measured at the gaochang fushun beibei and wulong hydrological stations respectively the data materials are collected mainly include 1 the 6 h observed inflow of tgr the 6 h observed flow discharge at the pingshan gaochang fushun beibei and wulong hydrological stations during the flood season may september from 2010 to 2021 2 the 6 h observed rainfall from 143 rainfall stations table 2 in the interval basin during the 2010 2021 flood season may september the tyson polygon method is used to calculate the surface average rainfall for each sub basin area 3 the forecasted precipitation data spatial resolution of each grid 0 125 e 0 125 n from the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf for the 2017 2021 flood season may september in three sub basins its forecast basis time is 8 00 a m every day with the 6 168 h forecast horizons and the 6 h forecast interval all materials are provided by the bureau of hydrology of the yangtze river water resources commission the training period is the first 7 years from 2010 to 2016 and the validation period is the last 5 years from 2017 to 2021 since the forecast precipitation is based on the daily 8 00 a m the forecasted flow for the 6 168 h forecast horizons is also calculated from the daily 8 00 a m in the validation period the characteristics of the dataset used in this study is listed in table 3 on which the precipitation of the three sub areas is the observed precipitation data in the training period and the forecast precipitation data of ecmwf in the validation period it can be seen that the characteristics of data series in the training and validation periods are similar 3 3 feature variable selection there are nine types of data series used in the study including precipitation data in three sub basins flow discharge from five hydrologic stations pingshan gaoba fushun beibei and wulong stations and previously observed inflow at the tgr dam site these datasets are selected as input variables for the neural network the da lstm red and lstm red models inputs consist of two parts input of encoding and decoding processes 1 input of the encoding process the inflow of tgr is based on the observed reservoir water level and outflow discharge which cannot reflect the specific inflow point for the models to learn more comprehensive information the nine input variables of the last 11 time steps 66 h are selected as the input of the encoding process for the lstm red and da lstm red models based on the flow propagation times from the mainstream and tributary control stations to the tgr dam site 2 input of the decoding process the inputs of the decoding process are the forecasted precipitation the forecasted flow of the mainstream and tributary and the forecasted flow of the neural network for the previous forecast horizon the observed precipitation of three subareas is used as input to the decoding process when training the neural network and the forecast precipitation of ecmwf is used in the validation period for the forecasted flow of the mainstream and tributary observations are used as input to the decoding process in both the training and validation periods the target output is the observed inflow of the tgr for the 6 168 h forecast horizons which is needed in the real time flood forecasting work 4 result evaluation 4 1 deterministic forecast results 4 1 1 evaluation of continuous flood process forecast results the neural network is trained 10 times for each hyperparameter combination scheme and the best forecast accuracy is selected as the final result the nse metrics for the validation period 1 7d forecast horizons are used to illustrate the calculation results under different hyperparameters as shown in table 4 it is found that the best forecasting performance is achieved for the encoder and decoder of both models using one layer of the lstm neural network containing 64 neurons with a dropout of 0 001 fig 3 compares the nse mae and re metrics of the da lstm red and lstm red models respectively it can be observed that both models have similar evaluation metrics in the training period and can obtain high forecast accuracy in different forecast horizons during the validation period after inputting ecmwf forecast precipitation the nse metrics of both models show a decreasing trend and the re and mae metrics show an increasing trend with the increase of the forecast horizon which indicates a decrease in forecast accuracy during the 6 168 h forecast horizon the nse metrics of the da lstm red model are at least 0 92 the mae metrics are in the range of 1163 2191 m3 s and the absolute values of the re metrics are within 2 the nse metrics of the lstm red model are in the range of 0 88 0 97 the mae metrics are in the range of 1182 2429 m3 s and the absolute values of the re metrics are within 5 meanwhile it can be found that the da lstm red and lstm red models have few differences in nse re and mae metrics before the 36 h forecast horizon and both can obtain high forecast accuracy after the 42 h forecast horizon the forecast accuracy of the da lstm red model is better than that of the lstm red model and the advantage is gradually obvious as the forecast horizon increases the results of the validation period show that the da lstm red model can effectively improve the accuracy of flood forecasting in the long forecast horizons 3 7d of the tgr compared with the lstm red model especially in the mae metric which is significantly advantageous with 10 17 reduction compared to the lstm red model in addition the proposed model can extend the forecast horizon by adding forecast precipitation inputs in the red structure under the limited observed input variables to obtain a high accuracy of multi temporal flood process forecasting which is an important reference value for flood control decisions fig 4 shows the scatter plots of the da lstm red and lstm red models at 24 96 and 168 h forecast horizons in the validation period the scatter points can be observed to gradually deviate from the ideal line as the forecast horizon increases the da lstm red model deviated less than the lstm red model during the 168 h forecast horizon especially at medium 20 000 50 000 m3 s and high 50 000 m3 s flow scatters differences are noticeable fig 4 c and f the da lstm red model is more compact and closer to the ideal line in the medium and high flow scatters it can be observed that the lstm red model underestimates most of the high flow scatters while the da lstm red model can forecast the high flow scatters more accurately therefore it is further verified that the da lstm red model can improve the forecast accuracy for long forecast horizons 4 1 2 evaluation of flood event forecast results to further compare the forecast accuracy of da lstm red and lstm red models a total of six floods with peaks exceeding 50 000 m3 s in the validation period 2017 2021 are selected for analyzing 24 h 96 h and 168 h forecast horizons the average relative error index of peak pre cui et al 2022 is added to analyze the forecasting performance of the two models for flood peaks table 5 shows the forecast evaluation metrics for the six flood events the nse metric shows a decreasing trend with the increase of the forecast horizon while the re mae and pre metrics show an increasing trend indicating a gradual decrease in the forecast performance in the 24 h forecast horizon the evaluation metrics of the proposed model are significantly better than the lstm red model in the 20180714 and 20200820 flood events in the remaining flood events the two models have similar forecasting accuracy with the nse metrics exceeding 0 92 the evaluation metrics of the da lstm red model gradually outperformed the lstm red model in the 96 and 168 h forecast horizons taking the 168 h forecasting period with the relatively noticeable gap as an example the proposed model of the nse re mae and pre average values are 0 90 2 56 2467 m3 s and 5 54 respectively while the mean values of the nse re mae and pre of the lstm red model are 0 76 0 37 4294 m3 s and 10 44 respectively overall the da lstm red model outperforms the lstm red model in six flood event forecasting to further describe the applicability of the two models in forecasting the six flood events the forecasted flood processes in the 168 h forecast horizon are shown in fig 5 it can be seen from fig 5 a that the lstm red model lags the forecast peak present time underestimates the flood peak and rising process and overestimates the receding process in the 20180703 flood event forecast similar problems occur with the da lstm red model still the average absolute error of flow is smaller than that of the lstm red model in the 20180714 flood event forecast fig 5 b the da lstm red model can accurately forecast the measured flood process although the observed flood peak is underestimated the proposed model can accurately capture the rising and receding water processes and the peak present time in contrast the lstm red model severely underestimates the flood volume and overestimates the rising water process resulting in relatively low forecast accuracy both models underestimate the flood volume for the 20200717 flood event forecast fig 5 c but the da lstm red model can forecast the peak present time and receding water process relatively accurately the lstm red model on the other hand shows irregular fluctuations in the forecasted flood process and forecasts lagged peak present time for the 20200727 flood event forecast fig 5 d the two models forecast the flood processes with similar shapes and the da lstm red model forecasts the flood peak with relatively small errors while the lstm red model has a higher water volume error the 20200820 flood event fig 5 e is the highest flood event in the validation period and it can be observed that the da lstm red model can forecast the flooding process with relative accuracy and slightly overestimate the observed flood peak in contrast the lstm red model severely underestimates the rising water process and flood peaks and overestimates the receding water process hugely detrimental to flood control decisions both models have similar forecast flood processes for the 20210907 flood event fig 5 f and underestimate flood peaks the da lstm red model has a slight advantage in forecasting flood peaks and receding water processes 4 2 probabilistic forecast results the copula hup method is used for probabilistic post processing of da lstm red deterministic forecast results since the probabilistic forecast calculation process is the same for lstm red and da lstm red models the da lstm red model is used as an example to construct a probabilistic flood forecasting framework for the xiangjiaba tgr interval basin finally the influence of copula function on the probabilistic forecast performance of copula hup method is discussed 4 2 1 selection of marginal distribution it is necessary to fit the marginal distribution of the observed flow and the forecast flows of 6 168 h forecast horizons the observed flow corresponding to the forecast horizon qo and the observed flow at the moment of forecast basis qb obey the same distribution fig 6 a and b show the ks test statistics and rmse values for the five distributions respectively from fig 6 a the ks statistics of p iii and lognormal distributions are less than the critical value 0 051 and passed the ks test moreover from fig 6 b the lognormal distribution has the lowest rmse value therefore the lognormal distribution function is chosen as the marginal distribution 4 2 2 selection of copula function according to eq 18 it is necessary to construct a three dimensional joint distribution of qo qb and qf as shown in fig 7 the kendall rank correlation coefficients among qo qb and qf are asymmetric the correlation coefficient between qo and qf is the highest therefore the asymmetric archimedean copula function is used to construct the joint distribution of the three variables i e the two dimensional joint distribution of qo and qf is first constructed and qb is coupled to construct the three dimensional joint distribution as can be seen from fig 8 a the gumbel and clayton copula functions fail the ks test in most forecast horizons the frank copula function has only a few statistics below the critical value and the student and gaussian copula functions mostly pass the ks test as shown in fig 8 b the rmse values of frank student and gaussian copula functions are similar and significantly lower than those of gumbel and clayton copula functions to explore the influence of copula functions on the probabilistic forecasting performance of the hup method frank student and gaussian copula functions are chosen to derive the formulas of the hup method and construct three methods frank copula hup student copula hup and gaussian copula hup respectively 4 2 3 probabilistic forecasting results of hup method based on different copula functions fig 9 a b and c show the average coverage rate cr average relative bandwidth rb and puci evaluation metrics for the forecast interval of 90 confidence level respectively from fig 9 a the forecast intervals with cr values close to or above 90 confidence level can be obtained based on frank copula hup student copula hup and gaussian copula hup methods in the 6 168 h forecast horizons indicating that the forecast intervals are reliable moreover the difference between the three hup methods cr values does not exceed 0 03 it is evident from fig 9 b that the rb values of the three hup methods show an increasing trend with the increase of the forecast horizon indicating a gradual increase in forecast uncertainty among them the rb values of frank copula hup are significantly higher than those of student and gaussian copula hup methods while student copula hup has the lowest rb value indicating that the forecast uncertainty can be effectively reduced by student copula function as seen in fig 9 c the puci values of student copula hup are significantly higher than those of gaussian and frank copula hup methods during the 6 18 h forecast horizons after the 24 h forecast horizon the puci values of student copula hup are slightly higher than those of gaussian copula hup meanwhile frank copula hup is relatively lower indicating that the forecast intervals of student copula hup quantify uncertainty relatively well fig 9 d shows the continuous ranked probability score crps values for the three hup methods the crps values of the three hup methods are lower than the mean absolute error mae values of the da lstm red model indicating that the probabilistic forecasts are effective and can fit the posterior distribution of the target values better meanwhile frank copula hup has the highest crps values student and gaussian copula hup methods have similar crps values which may be related to the fact that student copula and gaussian copula belong to the same cluster of elliptic copula functions and both have similar properties such as symmetric tail correlation the crps of the student copula hup method is relatively the lowest indicating that the hup method constructed by using the student copula function can better fit the actual posterior distribution function and effectively improve the probabilistic forecasting performance to visually analyze the performance of the copula hup method to quantify forecast uncertainty the forecast intervals with a 90 confidence level of the student copula hup method which has relatively better probabilistic forecast performance according to the crps metric are shown in fig 10 for the 24 96 and 168 h forecast horizons taking the year of abundant water 2020 as an example the forecast interval gradually becomes wider as the forecast horizon increases indicating that the forecast uncertainty gradually increases in the 24 96 and 168 h forecast horizons the student copula hup can cover most of the observed flows indicating that the forecast intervals are reasonably reliable meanwhile the student copula hup can always cover the maximum flood peak providing effective risk information for flood control and scheduling decisions in summary the combination of the da lstm red model and student copula hup method can not only improve the flood forecasting accuracy of tgr but also reduce the forecast uncertainty and provide reliable risk information which can provide valuable assistance for flood warning and scheduling decisions for the tgr 5 discussion according to the above study it can be found that the da lstm red model has better forecasting performance than the lstm red model the possible reasons from the perspective of the model structure are analyzed mainly including the following 1 the da lstm red model highlights the critical input variables that affect forecast accuracy by assigning weights to the input variables of the encoding process the da lstm red model can adjust parameters such as the weights in eq 1 by a backpropagation algorithm during the training period so that the weights of different input variables can change adaptively as the loss function decreases thus the weights of key input variables are increased and the weights of redundant low relevance variables are decreased which may make it easier for the model to capture the nonlinear relationship between crucial input variables and target output fig 11 shows the comparison of the input variable weights and correlation coefficients x1 x2 and x3 are the average surface rainfall in the interval from pingshan to cuntan cuntan to wanxian and wanxian to three gorges respectively x4 x5 x6 x7 and x8 are the observed flows at beibei station tuo river fushun station jialing river gaochang station min river wulong station wu river and pingshan station xiangjiaba respectively x9 is the previous tgr inflow fig 11 a shows the weights of the input variables learned by the da lstm red model fig 11 b shows the correlation coefficients of the input variables from x1 to x8 with the target variable the tgr observed inflow fig 11 c indicates that the tgr observed inflow has a strong autocorrelation as seen in fig 11 the trend of the input variable weights is similar to the trend of the correlation coefficient the input variables with high correlation coefficients 0 6 with the target variables received high weights 0 11 proving that the da lstm red model can identify the input variables with high correlation with the target variables i e it can roughly learn the input variables that are relatively important to the overall forecast performance which improves the interpretability of deep learning to some extent aslam et al 2023 conducted a multi step ahead wind power prediction using a deep learning model similar to the da lstm red model their study showed that the da mechanism also assigned relatively high weights to the input factor that had a high correlation to power generation e g wind speed bi et al 2023 also demonstrated in a multi step ahead prediction study of pm2 5 and chlorophyll data that the attention mechanism can identify relatively important input variables however this interpretability is limited i e the relevance of the input variables cannot be ranked according to their weights for example the previous tgr inflow x9 the highest correlation with the target output is not assigned the highest weight the lstm red model does not weight the input variables which relatively increases the influence of redundant input variables on the results and may produce lower forecast accuracy 2 the da lstm red model highlights the hidden layer states at critical moments by assigning weights to the hidden layer states at all moments of the encoding process and makes the ct fig 1 corresponding to each forecast horizon change adaptively according to eq 9 the proposed model can extract the information more closely associated with the target output in the hidden layer states generated by the encoding process as the input to the decoding process fig 12 shows the weights of different input moments and types of input variables learned by the proposed model during the training period the proposed model learns different temporal weights changing the input variables weights at different moments the input variables close to the forecast basis moment have relatively high weights similar to the conclusion by ding et al 2020 meanwhile noor et al 2022 and lin et al 2022 used an lstm neural network incorporating the da mechanism for water level and electricity load forecasting respectively their results showed that the da mechanism assigned different weights in different input time steps and the moment closest to the forecast basis time was also assigned the highest weights this further indicates that the proposed da lstm red model can effectively identify the valuable information extracted at the critical moment the ct input to the decoding process of the lstm red model is invariant and is the hidden layer state at the last moment of the encoding process all the time however the encoding process is a process of information compression there is inevitably information loss which may lead to ct not maintaining a high correlation with the target variables and is not beneficial to multi step ahead flood forecasting 3 the da lstm red model can also obtain the integrated weights of the input variables based on the temporal weights and the input feature weights to determine the relatively important input types thus the proposed model can highlight the relatively important forecast information in the forecast input variables which is similar to point 1 in contrast the lstm red model does not deal with the forecast input variables which may not be conducive to the lstm neural network in the decoding process to learn the connection between the forecast input and the target output 6 conclusion this study proposed a da lstm red model that integrates the feature temporal dual attention mechanism and recursive encoder decoder structure into the lstm neural network and combines the forecasted precipitation from ecmwf for multi step ahead flood process forecasting of the tgr and then the copula hup is adopted to quantify the predictive uncertainty of the proposed model lastly the effect of different copula functions on the probabilistic forecast performance is tested the main conclusions are summarized below 1 according to the evaluation metrics nse re and mae of da lstm red and lstm red models the dual attention mechanism can effectively improve the flood forecast accuracy of the lstm red model for long forecast horizons the mae metrics of the da lstm red model in the 3 7d forecast horizons are reduced by 10 17 relative to the lstm red model 2 combining with forecast precipitation in the decoding process can effectively extend the forecast horizon and maintain high forecast accuracy even if the observed input data are limited in the encoding process meanwhile the proposed model can identify the input variables highly correlated with the target output variables which improves the interpretability of the deep learning model to a certain extent 3 according to the cr rb and puci metrics the couple hup can provide forecast intervals with the cr value close to or exceeding a 90 confidence level meanwhile the student copula hup has the narrowest forecast intervals than the frank and gaussian copula hup and can effectively reduce the forecasting uncertainty 4 the crps metrics of student copula hup are lower than those of frank and gaussian copula hup which can better fit the posterior distribution effectively improving the probabilistic forecast performance and providing a new modeling alternative for the copula hup therefore combining the da lstm red model with student copula hup can provide valuable reference information for flood warning and scheduling decisions for the tgr the limitation of the proposed model includes the need for the input variable type of the encoding process to be consistent with the input type of the decoding process due to the use of integrated weights to highlight key forecast information in the decoding process therefore future research can explore a deep learning model with the dual attention mechanism without this limitation meanwhile this experiment is conducted only in the tgr basin and the effectiveness of the proposed model can be further verified in the global river basins credit authorship contribution statement zhen cui

1785,in order to improve the flood forecasting accuracy and reflect the forecast uncertainty information in the three gorges reservoir tgr interval basin in china this study integrates the feature and temporal dual attention da mechanism and recursive encoder decoder red structure into the long short term memory lstm neural network to develop a da lstm red model the feature attention acts on the input variables of the encoder and the temporal attention mechanism acts on the hidden layer states extracted by the lstm neural network during encoding process prompting the proposed model to extract critical input information among different types and moments of input variables to improve the multi step ahead flood forecasting accuracy second the copula based hydrological uncertainty processor copula hup is used to quantify the forecast uncertainty of the proposed model meanwhile creating multi step ahead flood probabilistic forecasts combining the long term 6 h hydrologic data series of the xiangjiaba tgr interval basin and the forecasted precipitation from the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf the effectiveness of the proposed model the effect of forecast precipitation on multi step ahead flood forecasting and the effect of different copula functions on the probabilistic forecast of copula hup are investigated respectively the results show that the da lstm red model can effectively improve the forecasting accuracy for long forecast horizons 3 7d compared to the lstm red model and the average absolute error metrics are reduced by 10 17 meanwhile the proposed model can identify input variables with a high correlation with the target output variables which improves the interpretability of deep learning to a certain extent the student copula hup has the lowest rb and crps metrics than the frank and gaussian copula hup which can better quantify the da lstm red model s forecast uncertainty therefore combining the proposed model with the student copula hup can effectively reduce the forecasting uncertainty enhance the forecasting reliability and accuracy for future horizons and provide reliable risk information for the tgr flood control scheduling decision keywords dual attention mechanism encoder decoder deep learning hydrological uncertainty processor copula function probabilistic forecasting data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction the construction of reservoirs has changed the runoff generation and flow confluence conditions in the interval basins of reservoirs which makes the rainfall runoff conversion law gradually change e g the xiangjiaba three gorges reservoir interval basin and has a growing impact on reservoir inflow forecasting xue et al 2021 the interval basin of reservoirs usually has complex inflow situations which are challenging to model and highly uncertain the interval basin s range generally includes the basin boundary between the upstream reservoir dam or interval tributary control stations and the downstream reservoir dam the flow production and confluence of the interval basin directly influences the flood magnitude of the downstream reservoir therefore the accurate and reliable flood forecasting is vital for reservoir flood control and scheduling decision zhou et al 2019 however many factors affect the accuracy of interval flood forecasts such as the discharge flow for upstream mainstream and tributary reservoir scheduling decisions the distribution characteristics of precipitation intensity in the interval basin and the changing basin subsurface characteristics which make it difficult to obtain the characteristic parameters or observation data of the interval basin cho and kim 2022 the process based hydrological models and data driven models are usually used to simulate rainfall and runoff transformation processes liu et al 2022a liu et al 2022b the former adopts empirical formulas to approximate the physical mechanism of the rainfall runoff relationship which follows the principle of mass conservation and has strong interpretability cui et al 2021 however the process based hydrological model usually requires many parameters and data types chen et al 2022 meanwhile with the enhanced impact of human activities and climate change it is difficult for process based hydrological models to simulate runoff generation processes under changing environments yang et al 2019 the data driven model based on finding the association between forecast factors and target outputs from the big dataset is easy to model and apply in practice however it does not consider physical causal mechanisms and has difficulty in explaining the relationship between inputs and outputs resulting in low confidence and interpretability young et al 2017 in recent years as artificial intelligence techniques develop rapidly many advanced deep learning models suitable for dealing with nonlinear time series forecasting problems have emerged konapala et al 2020 granata et al 2022 and gradually improved the forecasting accuracy and interpretability of data driven models kao et al 2021 cui et al 2022 among them the long short term memory lstm neural network is one of the most representative models and is a special kind of recurrent neural network which overcomes the gradient explosion or disappearance problem hochreiter schmidhuber 1997 kratzert et al 2018 apaydin et al 2021 the recurrent structure within the lstm model can handle the connection between input and output variables in the temporal dimension gao et al 2020 some hydrologists have shown high research interest in lstm models for multi step ahead flood forecasting for example kao et al 2021 proposed a novel sae rnn model that combined the stacked autoencoder saes with the lstm neural network and found that it could obtain accurate and reliable multi step ahead inundation forecasts hunt et al 2022 trained the lstm model by meteorological and hydrological dataset from era5 and glofas era5 reanalyzes and historical streamflow series constructed a hybrid forecasting system combining physics based methods with statistical methods and found that the lstm models had the best medium term forecasting performance and broad application prospects with the emergence of the recursive encoder decoder red structure that can handle sequence to sequence problems cho et al 2014 sutskever et al 2014 the lstm lstm red model based on the red structure has attracted widespread attention kao et al 2020 han et al 2021 cui et al 2022 xiang et al 2020 ha et al 2021 different from the single output lstm model the lstm red model can convey the effective features extracted in the previous moment to the later moment in the encoding and decoding process xiang demir 2020 yin et al 2021 which can rapidly obtain the multi step ahead flood forecasting while considering the connection between the outputs of adjacent forecast horizons with high internal interpretability and applicability kao et al 2020 most studies focus on closed basins where runoff is mainly generated from precipitation however there are more factors affecting flood forecasting in the interval basins of reservoirs and reasonable dealing with the complex input factors in the lstm red model becomes the key to improving multi step ahead flood forecasting accuracy in recent years the attention mechanism has attracted much attention from scholars in time series forecasting problems due to properties such as feature interpretability alizadeh et al 2021 the attention mechanism is a resource allocation approach to solve the information redundancy problem in deep learning which can assist models in identifying and highlighting more critical information by assigning weights bahdanau et al 2014 luong et al 2015 etc thus improving the forecasting performance of the models among them the feature and temporal attentions are common attention mechanisms in the study of lstm neural networks the feature attention mechanism adaptively highlights the critical input variables by assigning weights to the input feature variables noor et al 2022 zhang et al 2022 the temporal attention mechanism acts on the effective information hidden layer states extracted by the lstm neural network at each time step by assigning weights to highlight the information extracted at key time steps in the temporal dimension girihagama et al 2022 yan et al 2021 to improve the ability of lstm neural networks to handle complex input variables and to achieve the identification of critical factors among different categories and moments of input variables qin et al 2017 coupled both feature and temporal dual attention da mechanisms to lstm neural networks and applied to temperature and stock prediction problems subsequently the da mechanism has gradually been applied to time series forecasting problems in transportation finance meteorology energy etc qin et al 2017 kim et al 2021 fan et al 2021 de medrano and aznarte 2020 ding et al 2020 introduced the da mechanism to lstm neural network for runoff forecasting and achieved the best forecast performance in three closed basins in the interval basins of reservoirs adopting the feature and temporal dual attention mechanism for weighting multiple input variables i e extracting effective information from the flow of mainstream and tributary control stations and interval production flow at different moments may be beneficial to improve the forecast accuracy and increase the model interpretability flood forecasting in the reservoir interval basin is usually subject to high uncertainty due to complex external inputs model structure and parameters raftery et al 2005 madadgar and moradkhani 2014 zhou et al 2020 the creation of the forecast intervals by probabilistic post processing techniques such as the hydrologic uncertainty processor hup is one of the effective methods to quantify uncertainty in hydrologic forecasts and widely used to supplement uncertainty information beyond point estimates zhou et al 2022 the hup method is proposed by krzysztofowicz kelly 2000 and uses the normal quantile transformation method to adapt to the non linear and non normal characteristics of the runoff series however the normal quantile transformation process is tedious complicated and prone to computational errors liu et al 2016 to avoids the normal quantile conversion process and improves the applicability of the hup method liu et al 2016 have modified the hup method based on the copula function i e copula hup hydrological probabilistic post processing of the raw forecast results using the hup method can provide additional risk information for water resources management decisions such as reservoir flood control and scheduling todini 2008 which plays a vital role in improving the reliability and value of incoming flood forecasts although the attention mechanism and hup method have been demonstrated to improve the accuracy of flood forecasting and quantify the forecast uncertainty there are still issues to be explored which can motivate the current study and form the research objectives 1 most studies on lstm neural networks coupled with the da mechanism focus on deterministic forecasting with a single output structure to the authors knowledge there is little research to couple the da mechanism with red structure based deep learning to explore multi step ahead flood probabilistic forecasting which needs further enriching the related theories and modelling methods 2 most studies on the lstm red model focus on the forecast performance with short forecast horizons or less than 10 time steps the precipitation forecasting information is not considered in the decoding process which cannot meet the demand for multi temporal flood process forecasting in practical operations liu et al 2022a liu et al 2022b 3 the copula hup does not consider the effects of different types of copula functions e g elliptic copula functions on the probabilistic forecasting performance the aims of this study are first to propose a novel da lstm red model that can visualize the importance of the input variables with different types and moments which can improve the interpretability of the deep learning and couple the forecasted precipitation from the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf for multi step ahead flood forecasting which is significant to meet demands of practical operations secondly a framework for multi step ahead flood probabilistic forecasting based on deep learning and the copula hup is proposed i e adopting the copula based hup to quantify the forecast uncertainty of the proposed model and the optimal probabilistic forecasting framework under different copula functions is explored in order to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method this study utilizes an inflow series of the three gorges reservoir tgr in china as a case study the rest of the paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the methods the case study and materials are introduced in section 3 section 4 evaluates and analyses the results section 5 discusses the advantages and interpretability of the proposed model conclusions and outlook are given in section 6 2 methods this study proposes a da lstm red model and verifies its effectiveness by taking the lstm red model as the benchmark model the hup method based on the copula function is used to quantify the forecast uncertainty of the proposed model the methods adopted in this study are briefly described as follows 2 1 dual attention mechanism based deep learning model this study couples the feature temporal dual attention da mechanism and recursive encoder decoder red structure to an lstm neural network proposes the da lstm red model and expects that it can effectively handle the complex and numerous input variables and improve the accuracy of multi step ahead flood forecasting in the interval basin of reservoirs the long short term memory lstm red neural network based on a recursive encoder decoder structure is used for multi step ahead flood forecasting the lstm neural network consists of four computational modules forgetting gate input gate memory unit state updating and output gate hochreiter schmidhuber 1997 the forgetting gate can filter out the unimportant information among the previous information the input gate can select useful information from the input the memory unit state which can store long term dependent information is updated by the forgetting and input gates the output gate can select and output useful information in the memory unit state the parameters of the lstm neural network e g weights and biases will be updated according to the loss function in the back propagation algorithm apaydin et al 2021 generally the hyperparameters composing the neural network structure have a relatively high impact on forecasting efficiency and performance because they directly affect the internal computational process of the neural network this type of hyperparameter mainly includes the number of hidden layers number of neurons dropout etc gao et al 2020 li et al 2021 a detailed description of the lstm neural network can be found in the literature by kratzert et al 2018 the recursive encoder decoder red structure is similar to that studied by kao et al 2020 and mainly consists of two calculation processes encoding and decoding processes the encoding process is used to extract the key information ct of the input variables in the decoding process ct and the output of the hidden layer at the previous moment are used as the input of the neural network at the latter moment through a recursive feedback input strategy the input to the neural network at the first moment of the decoding process is the observed flow corresponding to the forecast basis time in order to explore the influence of forecast information on the forecast accuracy of the multi temporal output of the lstm red model forecast information of the same input category as the encoding process is input in the decoding process in order to extract effective information from different types and moments of input variables and improve the forecast accuracy a feature temporal dual attention mechanism is introduced based on the lstm red model and the da lstm red model is proposed the dual attention mechanism of the proposed model can be divided into three parts feature attention module fig 1 a 1 temporal attention module fig 1 a 2 and forecast information processing module for the decoding process fig 1 b 1 1 feature attention module the feature attention module acts on the input variables of the encoding process the calculation principle is as follows qin et al 2017 1 r z r z 1 r z 2 r z k v r tanh w h r h z 1 e w c r c z 1 e w x r x e z 1 m 2 α z l e x p r z l i 1 k e x p r z i l 1 k 3 α z α z 1 α z 2 α z k 4 x z e x z e 1 x z e 2 x z e k α z x z e α z 1 x z e 1 α z 2 x z e 2 α z k x z e k where xe is the input variable for the encoding process x e x 1 e 1 x m e 1 x 1 e k x m e k w is the internal weight parameter of the neural network m is the number of input time steps for the encoding process k is the number of input variable types α is the weight of the input variable r is the transition variable in the calculation process x is the input variable after weighting by the feature attention module as shown by eq 1 and fig 1 a 1 the weights of the input variables are closely related to the hidden layer output at the previous moment of the encoding process which allows the model to adaptively highlight useful input variables during the training process 2 temporal attention module the temporal attention module acts on the hidden layer state of the encoding process output the calculation principle is as follows qin et al 2017 5 p t p t 1 p t 2 p t m h t 1 d w h p h e t 1 n 6 β t z e x p p t z j 1 m e x p p t j 7 β t β t 1 β t 2 β t m 8 h e h 1 e h 2 e h m e β t h e β t 1 h 1 e β t 2 h 2 e β t m h m e 9 c t i 1 m h i e where h e is the hidden layer state of the lstm neural network output during the encoding process h e h 1 e h 2 e h m e n is the maximum forecast horizon β is the temporal weight of the hidden layer state h is the hidden layer state after weighting by the temporal attention module ct is the effective information extracted by the corresponding encoding process in the t th forecast horizon from eq 5 and fig 1 a 2 it is observed that the effective information ct extracted by the encoding process is closely related to the state of the hidden layer at the previous forecast horizon of the decoding process therefore the effective information ct input in each forecast horizon of the decoding process can change adaptively 3 forecast information processing module in the decoding process the da lstm red model inputs the same type of forecast information as the encoding process in the decoding process and assigns weights to the forecast information to highlight the key forecast input variables first the input variable weights α in the feature attention module are averaged by time dimension i e the input variable weights α are multiplied by the temporal weights β to obtain the integrated weights α secondly the integrated weights α are multiplied with the forecast input of the decoding process in the t th forecast horizon finally a new forecast input highlighting the key information is obtained which is calculated as follows 10 α l i 1 m α i l β t i 11 α α 1 α 2 α k 12 x t d x t d 1 x t d 2 x t d k α x t d α 1 x t d 1 α 2 x t d 2 α k x t d k where x t d is the forecast input to the decoding process in the t th forecast horizon x t d x t d 1 x t d 2 x t d k x t d is the new forecast input after the integrated weight calculation the benchmark model is the lstm neural network with coupled red structure lstm red the validity of the proposed model will be verified in subsection 4 the input and output data of the above neural network are processed by the normalization method the trial and error method is often used to select the hyperparameters with a high impact on the structure of the lstm neural network mainly including the number of hidden layers the number of neurons and the dropout among them the range of the hidden layers is 1 5 with the interval of 1 the range of the number of neurons is 16 128 with the interval of 16 the dropout rate is in the range of 0 1 0 01 0 001 set the number of hidden layers and neurons of the encoding and decoding processes to be consistent similar to zhou 2020 gao et al 2020 li et al 2021 and apaydin et al 2021 the maximum epoch batch size and learning rate are set to 500 100 and 0 001 for both models respectively the early stopping method dynamically controls the epoch to prevent overfitting during training and the early patience is set to 80 the mean square error function is used for the loss function the model is trained by the adam method in tensorflow keras optimizers database of the python 3 7 software 2 2 copula based flood probabilistic forecasts based on bayesian principles the hydrological uncertainty processor hup can perform uncertainty analysis under the forecast value and the observed flow at the forecast basis moment krzysztofowicz and kelly 2000 which can be well interfaced with existing forecasting systems and has a broad application prospect its principle is as follows 13 p q o q f q b p q f q o q b p q o q b p q f q o q b p q o q b d q o where qo qb and qf are the observed flow the observed flow at the moment of forecast basis and the forecast flow respectively p denotes the probability density function pdf p q o q b p q f q o q b and p q o q f q b are the prior likelihood and posterior density functions respectively which are all conditional density functions in essence the hup method assumes that the data series obeys the normal distribution and requires converting the flow data series to gaussian space with the help of normal quantile transformation after obtaining the posterior distribution function it needs to use the jacobian inverse transformation to the original space which is a tedious and complicated process and easily produces errors affecting the applicability of the hup method since the copula function can flexibly construct the joint distribution function of multiple variables with arbitrary marginal distribution sklar 1959 liu et al 2016 proposed the copula based hup copula hup which can avoid the assumption of normal distribution the principle of the copula hup method is described as follows based on the copula function the prior cumulative distribution function cdf and pdf can be derived as follows liu et al 2016 14 p q o q b c 2 p q o p q b p q b 15 p q o q b dp q o q b d q o 2 c 2 p q o p q b p q o p q b d p q o d q o c 2 p q o p q b p q o where p denotes the cdf c 2 and c k denote the k dimensional copula density and distribution functions respectively the likelihood cdf and pdf can be derived as follows liu et al 2016 16 p q f q o q b 2 c 3 p q o p q f p q b p q o p q b c 2 p q o

method liu et al 2016 before constructing the equation 18 it is usually necessary to select the marginal distribution and the copula function the study intends to fit the preferred marginal distribution based on the kolmogorov smirnov ks test and the root mean square error rmse criterion from five distribution functions commonly used in the statistical hydrology such as pearson type iii p iii gamma normal lognormal and weibull liu et al 2016 chen et al 2012 the distribution function with the smallest rmse value is preferably selected as the theoretical distribution of the series based on passing the ks test and the parameters are estimated using the maximum likelihood method to explore the effect of copula functions on the probabilistic forecast performance of the hup method it is prepared to fit preferences from three commonly archimedean copulas gumbel hougaard frank and clayton copula and two elliptic copulas student t or student and gaussian copula functions based on ks test and root mean square error rmse criterion xiong et al 2019 furthermore several copula functions that pass the ks test and have relatively small rmse values will be selected to construct the hup method the expressions of gumbel hougaard frank and clayton copula functions can be referred to liu et al 2016 and the expressions of student and gaussian copula functions can be referred to chen et al 2013 2 3 evaluation metrics 1 deterministic evaluation metrics the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse metric is one of the most important and common metrics in hydrological forecasting which can indicate the fitting performance of the forecasted and the observed flows nash sutcliffe 1970 for the operation and scheduling of a large storage reservoir the accurate runoff volume forecast is more important than the peak discharge so the relative error of the total runoff re metric is chosen the mean absolute error mae metric can indicate the forecast error for each moment most importantly it can be compared with the probabilistic forecast metric i e the continuous ranked probability score crps raftery et al 2005 therefore the nse re and mae metrics are selected as deterministic forecast evaluation metrics 19 nse 1 i 1 n q o i q f i 2 i 1 n q o i q o 2 20 re i 1 n q f i i 1 n q o i i 1 n q o i 100 21 mae 1 n i 1 n q o i q f i where n is the sample number q o and q f denote the average of the observed and forecast flow respectively 2 probabilistic evaluation metrics the average coverage rate cr and the average relative bandwidth rb are the most common metrics to evaluate the performance of forecast intervals li et al 2021 the higher the cr value the more reliable the forecast interval the lower the rb value the lower the forecast uncertainty however xiong et al 2009 found that as the cr increases the rb value of the confidence interval also increases making it difficult to assess the performance of the forecast interval directly therefore the composite metric i e the percentage of observations bracketed by the unit confidence interval puci is used to evaluate the overall performance of the forecast interval the higher the puci value the lower the forecast uncertainty the crps is a composite index to evaluate the overall performance of probabilistic forecasts raftery et al 2005 representing both the reliability and sharpness of probabilistic forecasts the lower the crps value the better the overall performance of probabilistic forecasts and the better the fitting of the actual posterior distribution therefore the cr rb puci and crps are selected as probabilistic forecast evaluation metrics 22 cr n c n 23 rb 1 n i 1 n q u i q l i q o i 24 puci cr rb 25 crps 1 n i 1 n 0 p i r i r q o i 2 d r 26 i r q o i 1 r q o i 0 r q o i where i is the indicative function r is the flow variable nc is the number of qo within the forecast interval qu and ql are the upper and lower quartiles of the forecast interval respectively 3 case study and materials 3 1 study basin three gorges reservoir tgr is one of the largest hydraulic projects in the world undertaking a series of important tasks such as flood control power generation shipping and ecology zhong et al 2020 the tgr dam is located in sandouping yichang city hubei province china and controls a catchment area of about 1 million km2 with the annual mean flow discharge about 14 300 m3 s and the runoff about 451 billion m3 the normal storage water level of tgr is 175 m with the total storage capacity of about 39 3 billion m3 and the flood control capacity of about 22 15 billion m3 the length of the river under the normal storage water level of the reservoir is about 600 km with the average width of only 1 1 km and a wide backwater range which is a typical river type reservoir with the storage capacity coefficient of less than 4 the interval basin between xiangjiaba and tgr includes the basin between the control sites of the jinsha min tuo jialing and wu rivers in the upper reaches of the yangtze river whose runoff generation and flow concentration directly affect the inflow of the tgr the area of the interval basin is about 127 400 km2 accounting for about 13 of the tgr control area fig 2 shows the schematic diagram of the hydrologic control stations and rainfall stations from xiangjiaba to tgr interval basin the inflow of the tgr consists of the outflow discharge from the xiangjiaba reservoir the inflow of several tributaries such as min tuo jialing and wu rivers and the rainfall in the interval basin among them the runoff from the mainstream jinsha river and tributaries into the river network occupies a larger proportion of the total inflow which has a relatively significant impact on the tgr inflow the narrow river channel leads to a rapid increase in reservoir water level in addition the uncertainty of precipitation intensity and center location and the different propagation times of flow from mainstream and tributaries lead to differences in the impact of flow from different sources and moments on the tgr inflow these factors make flood forecasting in tgr always a significant challenge the flow propagation time from the mainstream and tributary hydrologic control stations to the tgr dam is shown in table 1 considering the uneven rainfall distribution due to the long and narrow interval basin the interval basin is divided into three sub basins pingshan cuntan cuntan wanxian and wanxian tgr dam site table 2 shows the information on sub basin area and rainfall station number in which 45 38 and 60 rainfall stations are located in these three sub basins respectively 3 2 study data materials the outflow discharge of xiangjiaba reservoir is observed at the pingshan hydrologic station as the mainstream flow the flow discharge from large tributaries min jialing tuo and wu rivers are measured at the gaochang fushun beibei and wulong hydrological stations respectively the data materials are collected mainly include 1 the 6 h observed inflow of tgr the 6 h observed flow discharge at the pingshan gaochang fushun beibei and wulong hydrological stations during the flood season may september from 2010 to 2021 2 the 6 h observed rainfall from 143 rainfall stations table 2 in the interval basin during the 2010 2021 flood season may september the tyson polygon method is used to calculate the surface average rainfall for each sub basin area 3 the forecasted precipitation data spatial resolution of each grid 0 125 e 0 125 n from the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf for the 2017 2021 flood season may september in three sub basins its forecast basis time is 8 00 a m every day with the 6 168 h forecast horizons and the 6 h forecast interval all materials are provided by the bureau of hydrology of the yangtze river water resources commission the training period is the first 7 years from 2010 to 2016 and the validation period is the last 5 years from 2017 to 2021 since the forecast precipitation is based on the daily 8 00 a m the forecasted flow for the 6 168 h forecast horizons is also calculated from the daily 8 00 a m in the validation period the characteristics of the dataset used in this study is listed in table 3 on which the precipitation of the three sub areas is the observed precipitation data in the training period and the forecast precipitation data of ecmwf in the validation period it can be seen that the characteristics of data series in the training and validation periods are similar 3 3 feature variable selection there are nine types of data series used in the study including precipitation data in three sub basins flow discharge from five hydrologic stations pingshan gaoba fushun beibei and wulong stations and previously observed inflow at the tgr dam site these datasets are selected as input variables for the neural network the da lstm red and lstm red models inputs consist of two parts input of encoding and decoding processes 1 input of the encoding process the inflow of tgr is based on the observed reservoir water level and outflow discharge which cannot reflect the specific inflow point for the models to learn more comprehensive information the nine input variables of the last 11 time steps 66 h are selected as the input of the encoding process for the lstm red and da lstm red models based on the flow propagation times from the mainstream and tributary control stations to the tgr dam site 2 input of the decoding process the inputs of the decoding process are the forecasted precipitation the forecasted flow of the mainstream and tributary and the forecasted flow of the neural network for the previous forecast horizon the observed precipitation of three subareas is used as input to the decoding process when training the neural network and the forecast precipitation of ecmwf is used in the validation period for the forecasted flow of the mainstream and tributary observations are used as input to the decoding process in both the training and validation periods the target output is the observed inflow of the tgr for the 6 168 h forecast horizons which is needed in the real time flood forecasting work 4 result evaluation 4 1 deterministic forecast results 4 1 1 evaluation of continuous flood process forecast results the neural network is trained 10 times for each hyperparameter combination scheme and the best forecast accuracy is selected as the final result the nse metrics for the validation period 1 7d forecast horizons are used to illustrate the calculation results under different hyperparameters as shown in table 4 it is found that the best forecasting performance is achieved for the encoder and decoder of both models using one layer of the lstm neural network containing 64 neurons with a dropout of 0 001 fig 3 compares the nse mae and re metrics of the da lstm red and lstm red models respectively it can be observed that both models have similar evaluation metrics in the training period and can obtain high forecast accuracy in different forecast horizons during the validation period after inputting ecmwf forecast precipitation the nse metrics of both models show a decreasing trend and the re and mae metrics show an increasing trend with the increase of the forecast horizon which indicates a decrease in forecast accuracy during the 6 168 h forecast horizon the nse metrics of the da lstm red model are at least 0 92 the mae metrics are in the range of 1163 2191 m3 s and the absolute values of the re metrics are within 2 the nse metrics of the lstm red model are in the range of 0 88 0 97 the mae metrics are in the range of 1182 2429 m3 s and the absolute values of the re metrics are within 5 meanwhile it can be found that the da lstm red and lstm red models have few differences in nse re and mae metrics before the 36 h forecast horizon and both can obtain high forecast accuracy after the 42 h forecast horizon the forecast accuracy of the da lstm red model is better than that of the lstm red model and the advantage is gradually obvious as the forecast horizon increases the results of the validation period show that the da lstm red model can effectively improve the accuracy of flood forecasting in the long forecast horizons 3 7d of the tgr compared with the lstm red model especially in the mae metric which is significantly advantageous with 10 17 reduction compared to the lstm red model in addition the proposed model can extend the forecast horizon by adding forecast precipitation inputs in the red structure under the limited observed input variables to obtain a high accuracy of multi temporal flood process forecasting which is an important reference value for flood control decisions fig 4 shows the scatter plots of the da lstm red and lstm red models at 24 96 and 168 h forecast horizons in the validation period the scatter points can be observed to gradually deviate from the ideal line as the forecast horizon increases the da lstm red model deviated less than the lstm red model during the 168 h forecast horizon especially at medium 20 000 50 000 m3 s and high 50 000 m3 s flow scatters differences are noticeable fig 4 c and f the da lstm red model is more compact and closer to the ideal line in the medium and high flow scatters it can be observed that the lstm red model underestimates most of the high flow scatters while the da lstm red model can forecast the high flow scatters more accurately therefore it is further verified that the da lstm red model can improve the forecast accuracy for long forecast horizons 4 1 2 evaluation of flood event forecast results to further compare the forecast accuracy of da lstm red and lstm red models a total of six floods with peaks exceeding 50 000 m3 s in the validation period 2017 2021 are selected for analyzing 24 h 96 h and 168 h forecast horizons the average relative error index of peak pre cui et al 2022 is added to analyze the forecasting performance of the two models for flood peaks table 5 shows the forecast evaluation metrics for the six flood events the nse metric shows a decreasing trend with the increase of the forecast horizon while the re mae and pre metrics show an increasing trend indicating a gradual decrease in the forecast performance in the 24 h forecast horizon the evaluation metrics of the proposed model are significantly better than the lstm red model in the 20180714 and 20200820 flood events in the remaining flood events the two models have similar forecasting accuracy with the nse metrics exceeding 0 92 the evaluation metrics of the da lstm red model gradually outperformed the lstm red model in the 96 and 168 h forecast horizons taking the 168 h forecasting period with the relatively noticeable gap as an example the proposed model of the nse re mae and pre average values are 0 90 2 56 2467 m3 s and 5 54 respectively while the mean values of the nse re mae and pre of the lstm red model are 0 76 0 37 4294 m3 s and 10 44 respectively overall the da lstm red model outperforms the lstm red model in six flood event forecasting to further describe the applicability of the two models in forecasting the six flood events the forecasted flood processes in the 168 h forecast horizon are shown in fig 5 it can be seen from fig 5 a that the lstm red model lags the forecast peak present time underestimates the flood peak and rising process and overestimates the receding process in the 20180703 flood event forecast similar problems occur with the da lstm red model still the average absolute error of flow is smaller than that of the lstm red model in the 20180714 flood event forecast fig 5 b the da lstm red model can accurately forecast the measured flood process although the observed flood peak is underestimated the proposed model can accurately capture the rising and receding water processes and the peak present time in contrast the lstm red model severely underestimates the flood volume and overestimates the rising water process resulting in relatively low forecast accuracy both models underestimate the flood volume for the 20200717 flood event forecast fig 5 c but the da lstm red model can forecast the peak present time and receding water process relatively accurately the lstm red model on the other hand shows irregular fluctuations in the forecasted flood process and forecasts lagged peak present time for the 20200727 flood event forecast fig 5 d the two models forecast the flood processes with similar shapes and the da lstm red model forecasts the flood peak with relatively small errors while the lstm red model has a higher water volume error the 20200820 flood event fig 5 e is the highest flood event in the validation period and it can be observed that the da lstm red model can forecast the flooding process with relative accuracy and slightly overestimate the observed flood peak in contrast the lstm red model severely underestimates the rising water process and flood peaks and overestimates the receding water process hugely detrimental to flood control decisions both models have similar forecast flood processes for the 20210907 flood event fig 5 f and underestimate flood peaks the da lstm red model has a slight advantage in forecasting flood peaks and receding water processes 4 2 probabilistic forecast results the copula hup method is used for probabilistic post processing of da lstm red deterministic forecast results since the probabilistic forecast calculation process is the same for lstm red and da lstm red models the da lstm red model is used as an example to construct a probabilistic flood forecasting framework for the xiangjiaba tgr interval basin finally the influence of copula function on the probabilistic forecast performance of copula hup method is discussed 4 2 1 selection of marginal distribution it is necessary to fit the marginal distribution of the observed flow and the forecast flows of 6 168 h forecast horizons the observed flow corresponding to the forecast horizon qo and the observed flow at the moment of forecast basis qb obey the same distribution fig 6 a and b show the ks test statistics and rmse values for the five distributions respectively from fig 6 a the ks statistics of p iii and lognormal distributions are less than the critical value 0 051 and passed the ks test moreover from fig 6 b the lognormal distribution has the lowest rmse value therefore the lognormal distribution function is chosen as the marginal distribution 4 2 2 selection of copula function according to eq 18 it is necessary to construct a three dimensional joint distribution of qo qb and qf as shown in fig 7 the kendall rank correlation coefficients among qo qb and qf are asymmetric the correlation coefficient between qo and qf is the highest therefore the asymmetric archimedean copula function is used to construct the joint distribution of the three variables i e the two dimensional joint distribution of qo and qf is first constructed and qb is coupled to construct the three dimensional joint distribution as can be seen from fig 8 a the gumbel and clayton copula functions fail the ks test in most forecast horizons the frank copula function has only a few statistics below the critical value and the student and gaussian copula functions mostly pass the ks test as shown in fig 8 b the rmse values of frank student and gaussian copula functions are similar and significantly lower than those of gumbel and clayton copula functions to explore the influence of copula functions on the probabilistic forecasting performance of the hup method frank student and gaussian copula functions are chosen to derive the formulas of the hup method and construct three methods frank copula hup student copula hup and gaussian copula hup respectively 4 2 3 probabilistic forecasting results of hup method based on different copula functions fig 9 a b and c show the average coverage rate cr average relative bandwidth rb and puci evaluation metrics for the forecast interval of 90 confidence level respectively from fig 9 a the forecast intervals with cr values close to or above 90 confidence level can be obtained based on frank copula hup student copula hup and gaussian copula hup methods in the 6 168 h forecast horizons indicating that the forecast intervals are reliable moreover the difference between the three hup methods cr values does not exceed 0 03 it is evident from fig 9 b that the rb values of the three hup methods show an increasing trend with the increase of the forecast horizon indicating a gradual increase in forecast uncertainty among them the rb values of frank copula hup are significantly higher than those of student and gaussian copula hup methods while student copula hup has the lowest rb value indicating that the forecast uncertainty can be effectively reduced by student copula function as seen in fig 9 c the puci values of student copula hup are significantly higher than those of gaussian and frank copula hup methods during the 6 18 h forecast horizons after the 24 h forecast horizon the puci values of student copula hup are slightly higher than those of gaussian copula hup meanwhile frank copula hup is relatively lower indicating that the forecast intervals of student copula hup quantify uncertainty relatively well fig 9 d shows the continuous ranked probability score crps values for the three hup methods the crps values of the three hup methods are lower than the mean absolute error mae values of the da lstm red model indicating that the probabilistic forecasts are effective and can fit the posterior distribution of the target values better meanwhile frank copula hup has the highest crps values student and gaussian copula hup methods have similar crps values which may be related to the fact that student copula and gaussian copula belong to the same cluster of elliptic copula functions and both have similar properties such as symmetric tail correlation the crps of the student copula hup method is relatively the lowest indicating that the hup method constructed by using the student copula function can better fit the actual posterior distribution function and effectively improve the probabilistic forecasting performance to visually analyze the performance of the copula hup method to quantify forecast uncertainty the forecast intervals with a 90 confidence level of the student copula hup method which has relatively better probabilistic forecast performance according to the crps metric are shown in fig 10 for the 24 96 and 168 h forecast horizons taking the year of abundant water 2020 as an example the forecast interval gradually becomes wider as the forecast horizon increases indicating that the forecast uncertainty gradually increases in the 24 96 and 168 h forecast horizons the student copula hup can cover most of the observed flows indicating that the forecast intervals are reasonably reliable meanwhile the student copula hup can always cover the maximum flood peak providing effective risk information for flood control and scheduling decisions in summary the combination of the da lstm red model and student copula hup method can not only improve the flood forecasting accuracy of tgr but also reduce the forecast uncertainty and provide reliable risk information which can provide valuable assistance for flood warning and scheduling decisions for the tgr 5 discussion according to the above study it can be found that the da lstm red model has better forecasting performance than the lstm red model the possible reasons from the perspective of the model structure are analyzed mainly including the following 1 the da lstm red model highlights the critical input variables that affect forecast accuracy by assigning weights to the input variables of the encoding process the da lstm red model can adjust parameters such as the weights in eq 1 by a backpropagation algorithm during the training period so that the weights of different input variables can change adaptively as the loss function decreases thus the weights of key input variables are increased and the weights of redundant low relevance variables are decreased which may make it easier for the model to capture the nonlinear relationship between crucial input variables and target output fig 11 shows the comparison of the input variable weights and correlation coefficients x1 x2 and x3 are the average surface rainfall in the interval from pingshan to cuntan cuntan to wanxian and wanxian to three gorges respectively x4 x5 x6 x7 and x8 are the observed flows at beibei station tuo river fushun station jialing river gaochang station min river wulong station wu river and pingshan station xiangjiaba respectively x9 is the previous tgr inflow fig 11 a shows the weights of the input variables learned by the da lstm red model fig 11 b shows the correlation coefficients of the input variables from x1 to x8 with the target variable the tgr observed inflow fig 11 c indicates that the tgr observed inflow has a strong autocorrelation as seen in fig 11 the trend of the input variable weights is similar to the trend of the correlation coefficient the input variables with high correlation coefficients 0 6 with the target variables received high weights 0 11 proving that the da lstm red model can identify the input variables with high correlation with the target variables i e it can roughly learn the input variables that are relatively important to the overall forecast performance which improves the interpretability of deep learning to some extent aslam et al 2023 conducted a multi step ahead wind power prediction using a deep learning model similar to the da lstm red model their study showed that the da mechanism also assigned relatively high weights to the input factor that had a high correlation to power generation e g wind speed bi et al 2023 also demonstrated in a multi step ahead prediction study of pm2 5 and chlorophyll data that the attention mechanism can identify relatively important input variables however this interpretability is limited i e the relevance of the input variables cannot be ranked according to their weights for example the previous tgr inflow x9 the highest correlation with the target output is not assigned the highest weight the lstm red model does not weight the input variables which relatively increases the influence of redundant input variables on the results and may produce lower forecast accuracy 2 the da lstm red model highlights the hidden layer states at critical moments by assigning weights to the hidden layer states at all moments of the encoding process and makes the ct fig 1 corresponding to each forecast horizon change adaptively according to eq 9 the proposed model can extract the information more closely associated with the target output in the hidden layer states generated by the encoding process as the input to the decoding process fig 12 shows the weights of different input moments and types of input variables learned by the proposed model during the training period the proposed model learns different temporal weights changing the input variables weights at different moments the input variables close to the forecast basis moment have relatively high weights similar to the conclusion by ding et al 2020 meanwhile noor et al 2022 and lin et al 2022 used an lstm neural network incorporating the da mechanism for water level and electricity load forecasting respectively their results showed that the da mechanism assigned different weights in different input time steps and the moment closest to the forecast basis time was also assigned the highest weights this further indicates that the proposed da lstm red model can effectively identify the valuable information extracted at the critical moment the ct input to the decoding process of the lstm red model is invariant and is the hidden layer state at the last moment of the encoding process all the time however the encoding process is a process of information compression there is inevitably information loss which may lead to ct not maintaining a high correlation with the target variables and is not beneficial to multi step ahead flood forecasting 3 the da lstm red model can also obtain the integrated weights of the input variables based on the temporal weights and the input feature weights to determine the relatively important input types thus the proposed model can highlight the relatively important forecast information in the forecast input variables which is similar to point 1 in contrast the lstm red model does not deal with the forecast input variables which may not be conducive to the lstm neural network in the decoding process to learn the connection between the forecast input and the target output 6 conclusion this study proposed a da lstm red model that integrates the feature temporal dual attention mechanism and recursive encoder decoder structure into the lstm neural network and combines the forecasted precipitation from ecmwf for multi step ahead flood process forecasting of the tgr and then the copula hup is adopted to quantify the predictive uncertainty of the proposed model lastly the effect of different copula functions on the probabilistic forecast performance is tested the main conclusions are summarized below 1 according to the evaluation metrics nse re and mae of da lstm red and lstm red models the dual attention mechanism can effectively improve the flood forecast accuracy of the lstm red model for long forecast horizons the mae metrics of the da lstm red model in the 3 7d forecast horizons are reduced by 10 17 relative to the lstm red model 2 combining with forecast precipitation in the decoding process can effectively extend the forecast horizon and maintain high forecast accuracy even if the observed input data are limited in the encoding process meanwhile the proposed model can identify the input variables highly correlated with the target output variables which improves the interpretability of the deep learning model to a certain extent 3 according to the cr rb and puci metrics the couple hup can provide forecast intervals with the cr value close to or exceeding a 90 confidence level meanwhile the student copula hup has the narrowest forecast intervals than the frank and gaussian copula hup and can effectively reduce the forecasting uncertainty 4 the crps metrics of student copula hup are lower than those of frank and gaussian copula hup which can better fit the posterior distribution effectively improving the probabilistic forecast performance and providing a new modeling alternative for the copula hup therefore combining the da lstm red model with student copula hup can provide valuable reference information for flood warning and scheduling decisions for the tgr the limitation of the proposed model includes the need for the input variable type of the encoding process to be consistent with the input type of the decoding process due to the use of integrated weights to highlight key forecast information in the decoding process therefore future research can explore a deep learning model with the dual attention mechanism without this limitation meanwhile this experiment is conducted only in the tgr basin and the effectiveness of the proposed model can be further verified in the global river basins credit authorship contribution statement zhen cui

1786,as the widely distributed transition zones connecting the terrestrial and marine ecosystems coastal bays have long water retention times to reconstruct the dom pool affecting global carbon cycling however we still have a limited understanding of mechanisms shaping the carbon cycling of coastal bays at regional scales to address this issue we combined stable carbon isotopes ultraviolet visible absorption fluorescence spectroscopy and ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry to investigate the spatiotemporal chemistry of dissolved organic matter dom in xiangshan bay a semi enclosed eutrophic bay in southeastern china the dom in xiangshan bay was characterized by a higher degree of humification and aromaticity during winter whereas the inverse signature during summer results showed that the significant seasonal variation of dom chemistry was mainly modulated by intense primary productivity stimulated by nutrients during summer and other factors including sediment pore water dom release and photochemical reactions additionally based on the microbial carbon pump mcp hypothesis marine microorganisms may synthesize biologically recalcitrant dom with millennia turnover time the efficient mcp associated with reduced nutrients probably acted as a critical factor in xiangshan bay leading to the formation of additional refractory molecular formulae carboxyl rich alicyclic molecules and a more recalcitrant signature of dom during winter incorporated with seven other coastal bays across china it is revealed that anthropogenic inputs substantially contributed to chinese coastal bays further studies need to better constrain the biogeochemical implications of these anthropogenic inputs more importantly decreasing the anthropogenic input of nutrients to coastal bays may enhance their functions in long term carbon sequestration keywords dissolved organic matter molecular composition microbial carbon pump xiangshan bay estuarine carbon cycling data

interfaces to modulate the terrestrial derived oc transport bauer et al 2013 however although biogeochemical processes associated with terrestrial derived organic matter om over the land ocean continuum have been widely studied in river dominated estuaries e g wagner et al 2015 zhou et al 2021 coastal bays have been paid less attention e g houghton 2007 compared with large river dominated estuaries coastal bays are characterized as semi enclosed transition zones connecting land and ocean usually with long water retention times zhao et al 2021 intense fusion of terrestrial and oceanic ecosystems and human disturbances would be amplified in such systems and trivial changes potentially have a significant impact on the flux of regional atmospheric co2 and long term carbon sequestration as such coastal bays are supposed to be not only conduits where om is transported to open oceans but also reactors where om is processed or transformed asmala et al 2018 specifically coastal bays are typically exposed to high fluxes of nutrients from intensive anthropogenic activities e g sewage discharges and flourishing aquaculture industries owing to their special landforms and locations near intensely populated settlements wang et al 2012 zhang et al 2020 excessive nutrients in coastal areas can bring out coastal eutrophication with high primary productivity producing fresh estuarine dom and activating the remineralization of terrestrial derived dom known as the priming effect bianchi 2011 on the other hand the microbial carbon pump mcp describes the biogeochemical processes and mechanisms that produce recalcitrant dissolved organic carbon rdoc throughout the water column jiao et al 2010 2014 these two competing mechanisms are coexistent and strengthened in coastal bays profoundly impacting the turnover time and fate of the terrestrial derived oc in the ocean previous studies have preliminarily explored the multi sources and behaviors e g physical mixing sediment resuspension and microbial photo degradation of dom in coastal bays chen and zheng 2013 sleighter and hatcher 2008 zhou et al 2019 nevertheless bearing in mind the sensitivity of dom to various ecological processes investigations for the alteration of dom in such ecosystems under the eutrophication status and its implications for carbon cycling are still limited rosemond et al 2015 schindler et al 2008 seasonal changes would significantly induce the shifts of the anthropogenic effluents groundwater infiltration and hydrological conditions and further control the fluxes of nutrients imported to coastal bays hence seasons probably serve as fundamental time scales to mediate om cycling in coastal bays uncovering the seasonal variations of dom chemistry in coastal bays can provide novel insights into regional and global estuarine carbon cycling as an intermediate medium for marine organic matter sequestration sediment pore water serves as a potential source of om to the water column for its much higher concentration especially in shallow eutrophic bays e g santos et al 2011 the interactions between the overlying water and sediment pore water dom are indispensable parts in studying the properties and fate of dom in the water column due to the considerable benthic flux of dom and significant transformation processes occurred at the water sediment interface burdige 2001 burdige et al 1999 zhou et al 2022 nevertheless limited studies have focused on seasonal variations in sources and reactivity of sediment pore water dom to further elucidate their impacts to dom transported seaward in coastal bays the chemical characterization of dom is a prerequisite to understanding its biogeochemical cycling for a comprehensive investigation of dom complexity multiple complementary analytical tools have been developed in addition to the traditional bulk approach e g stable carbon isotopes for source tracing behnke et al 2020 optical techniques e g excitation emission matrixes eems have been widely applied to the qualification and quantification of the fluorescent fraction of dom coble et al 1990 carstea et al 2016 recently the state of the art ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms allows to precisely obtain dom molecular level information which is an important determinant of its sources reactivity and transformation processes in aquatic ecosystems kurek et al 2020 qi et al 2022 integrating bulk optical and molecular characteristics can substantially improve our knowledge of dom compositions and cycling he et al 2020 kellerman et al 2015 timko et al 2014 xiangshan bay is a semi enclosed and eutrophic bay located in southeastern china to assess the variability in dom chemical composition across seasons as the largest aquaculture base in zhejiang province the inorganic nutrients in xiangshan bay have risen over the acceptable level for years yang et al 2018 jiang et al 2020 in this study we aim to i determine the seasonal variations in dom compositions of the water column and sediment pore water in xiangshan bay ii evaluate the sources and

a b it has three branched bays tie harbor huangdun harbor and xihu harbor the monthly variation of precipitation and temperature of xiangshan bay can be seen in fig s1 the water inside xiangshan bay originated mainly from coastal currents from adjacent coastal shelves and land runoffs amounts of rivers such as fuxi river on the top of the bay flow to xiangshan bay during summer over 60 precipitation concentrated from june to september meanwhile a proportion of changjiang diluted water cdw including changjiang river qiantang river and the surrounding watershed flows southward along the coast in winter liu et al 2021 the exchange of water and energy between xiangshan bay and the east china sea is restricted due to the prevention of by liuheng and meishan islands the upper and middle sections of this bay have long water residence times of approximately 80 and 65 days respectively for 90 of water exchanges ning and hu 2002 we selected 14 consistent stations covering xiangshan bay across the three seasons may 2019 december 2019 and october 2020 to investigate the variability of dom chemistry fig 1c the stations are the same as those in our previous investigation which only focused on the dom chemistry during summer zhao et al 2021 these 14 stations covered five sections of xiangshan bay watershed including tie harbor t1 t2 xihu harbor x1 x2 huangdun harbor h1 h2 inner harbor m1 m3 and outer harbor m4 m8 respectively significant differences in the hydrodynamics between the upper and lower bay revealed that the inner bay was dominated by gravity circulation from the bottom to the surface sea while the outer bay was mainly controlled by vertical oscillations li et al 2018 the surface and bottom water samples were collected with a niskin water collector the surface sediments c a 0 5 cm were carefully collected using a stainless steel box corer and the sediment pore water samples were immediately obtained by centrifugation 3600 r per minute 10 min within 10 h to better elucidate the source and transformation of xiangshan bay dom five surrounding freshwater river endmembers fuxi fx huangdunxi hdx shizikou szk yalinxi ylx dasongjiang dsj with salinity 0 were collected in october 2020 which entered xiangshan bay at varying locations fig 1c in addition we also collected several samples from other coastal bays in china for potential comparisons and to improve our knowledge to the carbon cycling processes in coastal bays multiple surface water samples were collected from zhelin bay 3 stations and shenzhen bay 5 stations during the summer of 2021 fig 1a surface water samples from the five consistent stations were collected in the summer july 2019 and winter january 2021 from jiaozhou bay respectively fig 1a after collecting all

matlab 2021a platform using the domflour toolbox to separate spectral signals into several fluorescent components stedmon and bro 2008 split half and random analyses were performed to validate the number of obtained components 2 4 solid phase extraction of dom and ft icr ms analysis according to the salinity gradient and biogeochemical differences among different sections we selected surface and bottom water column samples of three representative stations h1 x2 and m8 in summer and winter seasons for ft icr ms analyses samples were analyzed using a 9 4 t bruker daltonics ft icr ms bruker apollo ii under the negative ion soft ionization jet source mode at china university of petroleum beijing china details in supplementary materials he et al 2021 compared the ionization selectivity of appi source and esi source in the analysis of nature dom and found that the average h c and o c values of srnom obtained in esi mode were the closest to the results obtained from elemental analysis multi proxies such as modified aromatic index aimod equivalent double bond number dbe island of stability index ios and molecular lability index mlbl were calculated to depict dom compositions d

were calculated between sum normalized molecular peaks where the formulae were consistently assigned and present in all samples and parafac components or optical indices stubbins et al 2014 lavonen et al 2015 the principal component analysis pca was conducted on origin software originlab usa to examine the relationships among samples and parameters 3 results 3 1 bulk geochemical parameters there are no systematic differences between the surface and bottom samples of xiangshan bay and the average values of bulk and optical dom parameters at each station are shown in table s1 the average seawater salinity ranged from 20 4 to 25 7 psu the average doc concentrations of the water column during summer autumn and winter were 1 3 0 2 mg l 1 1 3 0 1 mg l 1 and 1 7 0 4 mg l 1 respectively and the variations of water column doc along with salinity in varying seasons were shown in fig 2 the average doc concentrations of sediment pore water during summer autumn and winter were 10 4 4 5 mg l 1 19 6 13 1 mg l 1 and 13 0 10 7 mg l 1 respectively table s2 the δ13c values of spe dom of water column samples varied from 26 3 to 24 6 for soluble nutrients the concentrations of sio3 2 no3 and nh4 were all significantly higher p 0 05 in summer whereas there was no significant difference for po4 3 p 0 05 fig s2 3 2 optical properties of cdom fdom the cdom parameters s275 295 and sr for water column were 0 014 0 026 nm 1 and 0 67 2 71 respectively and for sediment pore water were 0 014 0 046 nm 1 and 0 88 4 88 respectively the fdom parameters hix fi and bix for water column were 0 42 0 62 1 57 1 78 and 0 94 1 09 respectively and for sediment pore water were 0 23 0 80 1 80 2 50 and 0 77 1 45 respectively table s1 three fluorescent components were obtained by parafac analysis fig s3 we compared the fluorescent components acquired in this study with the openfluor online platform details in supplementary materials 1 2 one protein like c1 ex 250 nm em 300 nm and two humic like c2 ex 250 nm em 450 nm c3 ex 275 350 nm em 450 nm components were identified by parafac modeling with 161 water column and sediment pore water samples the average relative proportions of protein like components in water column fdom gradually decreased from summer 50 to autumn 39 and winter 37 the seasonal decoupling variations of optical indices were shown between the water column and sediment pore water dom the relative proportion of protein like components c1 c1 of the water column was significantly higher p 0 05 during summer than that during autumn and winter whereas the hix values c2 and c3 indicative of humification and aromaticity degree were significantly lower p 0 05 than that during autumn and winter fig 3 there was no significant optical indices difference between autumn and winter p 0 05 meanwhile for the sediment pore water dom no significant variations p 0 05 were observed between the summer and autumn for all fluorescent components however it is noted that a sharp change from labile to the aromatic signature of sediment pore water dom was shown from autumn to winter 3 3 molecular compositions of dom as revealed by ft icr ms ft icr ms analysis showed that a total of 11 299 formulae were assigned in the twelve samples during the summer and winter 8217 and 9403 unique formulae were detected in the summer and winter in their respective six spe dom samples 6321 molecular formulae were detected in both the summer and winter i e at least occurred one each in the summer or winter samples which accounted for 77 and 67 by number of unique formulae in the summer and winter respectively moreover 2783 common molecular formulae were constantly detected in all twelve spe dom samples regarding heteroatom containing compounds 3090 and 3858 chon unique formulae were detected during summer and winter respectively the average relative intensity of chon formulae during winter 18 6 0 3 was significantly higher p 0 05 than that during summer 15 2 1 5 1233 and 1115 chos formulae were detected during summer and winter respectively the average relative intensity of chos formulae during summer 12 9 4 9 was significantly higher p 0 05 than that during winter 5 7 1 8 molecular parameters displayed that winter dom had significantly p 0 05 higher o c aimod dbe and ios and lower h c mlbl than those during summer table s3 and fig 4 for compound group fractions the significantly higher p 0 05 relative intensity of pcas polyphenols and hu compounds occurred during winter by contrast the higher relative intensity of ua and peptides compounds occurred during summer table s4 unique formulae only present during summer or winter can further assist in evaluating the spatiotemporal variations of dom chemistry at a molecular level table s5 more unique formulae were present during winter 3082 vs 1896 while unique formulae only present during summer were related to more bio labile signatures with higher h c higher relative abundances of ua and peptide compounds and lower o c in contrast to formulae only present during winter a switch from more labile marine dom to more aromatic terrestrial dom could be observed from summer to winter fig 5 and temporal differences overwhelmed spatial differences huangdun harbor xihu harbor and outer harbor as shown in the van krevelen v k diagrams fig s4 it should be noticed that a fraction of unique formulae to summer or winter were only present once in all samples to ensure a more reliable understanding of seasonal variations of unique formulae we compared the unique formulae with different occurrences present only or more than once in all samples on v k diagrams fig s5 the results reveal that even for unique formulae that were only present once in all samples the difference between summer and winter are consistent with previous observations for unconstrained unique formulae confirming the dom seasonal variations in addition to analyses of unique formulae we also applied the inter sample ranking analyses for 2783 common formulae to understand dom variations between summer and winter and among spatial stations chen et al 2021 herzsprung et al 2017 she et al 2021 in order to better understand the spatiotemporal variations of dom surface dom samples from three regions in each season were displayed in v k diagrams fig s6 results confirm that seasonal dom quality differences dominate over spatial differences the molecular formulae in the higher ranks e g rank 1 3 relatively higher molecular relative intensities of summer samples displayed higher h c and lower o c while the formulae in the higher ranks of winter samples exhibited lower h c and higher o c in general the analyses to unique formulae and common formulae provide a consistent view of the dom seasonal variations in xiangshan bay 3 4 pca and spearman s rank correlation analyses the pca was conducted to assess the principal factors mediating seasonal variations of water column dom composition considering the continuous variations of dom chemistry from summer to winter we analyzed samples from two endmember seasons of summer and winter first all water column dom samples were analyzed by using bulk and optical indices fig 6 a twelve selected samples for ft icr ms analysis were then analyzed by using bulk optical and molecular indices fig 6b and two principal components pc1 and pc2 were identified and accounted for 51 3 and 17 2 of the total variations respectively fig 6b positive loadings along pc1 are related to humification associated indices e g aimod dbe ios and hix humic like fluorescent components e g c2 and c3 and aromatic molecular groups e g pcas polyphenols in contrast negative loadings along pc1 are mainly associated with biologically labile and aliphatic indices e g bix fi c1 ua peptides the sum normalized intensities of 2783 common formulae detected in all twelve spe dom samples were chosen for spearman s rank correlation analysis and 1642 formulae could correlate with at least one fluorescent component moreover 564 overlapped formulae correlated with humic like c2 and c3 components which accounted for 82 and 93 of their correlated formulae respectively suggesting the similarity between c2 and c3 components from a molecular perspective even though they were identified as two independent fluorescent components adversely the protein like c1 and humic like c2 or c3 components did not share any correlated formulae the correlated formulae for each component were plotted in v k diagrams fig s7 and the detailed information was shown in the supplementary materials fig s8 and table s6 results also show that the c1 component correlated with formulae with higher h c lower o c and more ua and peptides compounds whereas c2 and c3 components correlated with formulae with lower h c higher o c and more pcas polyphenols and heteroatomic compounds 4 discussion 4 1 seasonal variations in dom sources of the water column in xiangshan bay the stable carbon isotopic compositions of dom in three seasons table s1 all showed a mixing signature from terrestrial e g higher plant vegetation and soil erosion and marine e g in situ production or exudation by phytoplankton inputs cloern et al 2002 notably the dom from two stations located at the inner tie harbor and huangdun harbor t1 and h1 station has lower δ13c than other locations in summer which is probably explained by terrestrial inputs from inland rivers e g fuxi river the values of hix 0 42 0 62 s275 295 0 014 0 026 nm 1 and fi 1 57 1 78 table s1 which were previously used to determine the aromaticity degree or molecular mass of dom to discriminate terrestrial vs microbial sources exhibited similar ranges to those observed in other coastal bays such as laizhou bay jiang et al 2017 and bohai bay chen and zheng 2013 also suggesting allochthonous and autochthonous sources of dom in xiangshan bay moreover the optical indices hix c1 c2 and c3 fig 3a d molecular parameters h c o c aimod dbe ios mlbl and the relative intensities of pcas polyphenols hu and ua compounds fig 4 collectively indicate that the dom during winter was characterized as higher degrees of humification and aromaticity although cdom fdom and spe dom could only partly represent the whole dom pool the optical approaches and ft icr ms complement each other and thus provide an integrated view and strong evidence of changes in dom sources and composition among seasons the parafac components or optical indices were linked with formulae of ft icr ms through correlation analyses to determine their representatives to dom chemistry in inland or marine systems from a molecular perspective thus better constraining the dom cycling stubbins et al 2014 wagner et al 2015 applying this method to coastal bays can further explore and improve its applicability in aquatic environments it is revealed that c1 c3 components can represent most formulae 59 under current spe protocols and ft icr ms conditions the association between the protein like c1 with aliphatic molecular indices in this study further confirms the agreement of optical and molecular techniques to dom characterization and vice versa fig s7 s8 interestingly protein like c1 correlated with formulae with higher molecular mass which is interpreted as two potential reasons one possibility is that considering strictly common formulae were chosen for spearman s correlation analysis these formulae likely represented at least semi labile molecules whose turnover time was over several months and the smaller labile peptides with lower molecular mass compounds had been excluded alternatively c1 could be partly sourced from the degradation of larger peptides coble et al 1990 while those larger peptides with higher molecular mass compounds were beyond the analytical window by ft icr ms molecular weight 800 da here the heteroatomic compounds chon chos and chons compounds can be linked with protein like or humic like components in different aquatic ecosystems suggesting their complexity of sources stubbins et al 2014 he et al 2020 the enrichment of heteroatomic formulae was usually associated with the microbially derived dom especially in reduced environments sleighter and hatcher 2008 medeiros et al 2015 alternatively abundant chos compounds were likely the result of anthropogenic inputs considering they are much more abundant in anthropogenically perturbated wastewater discharge than in natural environments gonsior et al 2011 he et al 2019 further examination reveals that o3s and o5s compounds were likely associated with surface active chemicals such as dialkyl tetralin sulfonates dats and alkyl benzene sulfonates las gonsior et al 2011 wagner et al 2015 and their high relative intensity resulted in the non normal distribution of chos class in both seasons fig s9a b comparing of seasons reveals that chos class deviated from normal distribution to a larger extent during summer as well as the sharp decrease 34 to 3 of relative intensities of unique chos formulae in the h1 station near huangdunxi river from summer to winter table s5 moreover the decreasing trend of the relative intensity of chos formulae with salinity was only observed in summer table s4 and fig s9c d probably resulting from the dilution of seawater and or degradation of heterotrophic microbes osterholz et al 2016 therefore these temporal and spatial distribution patterns of chos compounds suggest that they were mainly from fluvial inputs with intensive anthropogenic signals 4 2 seasonal variations in sediment pore water dom in xiangshan bay sediment pore water dom has been considered as an intermediate of sediment oc preservation burdige et al 1999 and nutrients regeneration from sediment particulate organic matter pom remineralization can provide a substantial fraction of nutrients to fuel primary productivity cowan and boynton 1996 meantime the concentrations of pore water are usually several times higher than those in overlying seawater due to the degradation of pom in sediments burdige et al 1999 chen and hur 2015 which is also the case in xiangshan bay table s2 thus likely diffusing to the overlying water column to alter the chemical compositions of water dom burdige and komada 2015 the sediment pore water has significantly characterized the dom pool larger range of optical parameters as divergent from that of the water column fig 3 a plausible reason is that compared with the water column pore water stored in sediments was relatively poorly mixed and its compositional chemistry was largely dependent on the biogeochemical processes occurring at small spatial scales burdige and komada 2015 singer et al 2010 many studies have shown different chemical characteristics of sediments pore water dom and mostly suggested that it was characterized as more humic like and aromatic signatures than overlying water in chesapeake bay liaohe wetland and boreal lakes burdige 2001 lu et al 2020 valle et al 2020 while recent studies in the east china sea reported that sediment pore water dom can be alternatively dominated by microbial activities such as the virus lysis in sediments and bacterial metabolisms li et al 2020 zhou et al 2022 in xiangshan bay seasonal variations of dom chemistry in sediment pore water were observed to mimic the overlying water column fig 3 tables s1 s2 however to a more considerable extent a drastic change from labile to aromatic signature of the sediment pore water dom was shown from autumn to winter this decoupling trend between the water column and sediment pore water dom was interpreted as following processes firstly amounts of freshly aliphatic dom were produced by phytoplankton and preserved in sediment pore water under the eutrophication status during summer nutrient supplies from sediment regeneration could also promote microbial metabolisms in sediments and the accumulation of labile dom in sediment pore water during summer kaiser and benner 2008 zhang et al 2019 afterward with the more unfavorable condition e g temperature nutrients for phytoplankton growth during autumn the debris of dead phytoplankton would settle down to sediments resulting in comparable labile signals in sediment pore water dom thornton 2014 moreover the aquaculture industry in xiangshan bay especially the fish cage requires numerous nutrients jiang et al 2013 it is reported that over 50 of nutrients feed cannot be utilized by fish islam 2005 wu 1995 causing remaining nutrients and labile compounds to circulate in the water column and settle down into sediments finally accumulated labile dom would be gradually transformed to aromatic dom by benthic microbes during winter burdige 2001 reader et al 2019 this explanation is supported by the incubation experiments which proved that approximately 50 of sediment pore water doc was consumed within two days with the succession of microbial community and residual recalcitrant dom cai et al 2019 4 3 seasonal controls on dom chemistry in xiangshan bay pca shows that dom pools from each compartment i e summer and winter seasons were more analogous among themselves than pools from different compartments across xiangshan bay fig 6a b therefore the seasonal variation of dom chemistry is more significant than the spatial variation even across the whole xiangshan bay the pc1 separates samples well and likely represents the season variable pc2 has positive loadings on several indices associated with anthropogenic inputs fig 6b including nutrients no2 no3 sio3 2 optical indices fi o3s o5s compounds and pyrogenic molecular group pcas bao et al 2012 stubbins et al 2012 dong and rosario ortiz 2012 proposed that abnormally high fi was likely caused by domestic wastewater imprinted with human activities also summer samples from huangdun harbor near the river hdx had very positive pc2 scores indicating that stations inner the bay suffered from strong anthropogenic signals through surrounding rivers fig 6b d as collaborated by our discussion of the spatiotemporal distribution of chos compounds although there is a narrow range of salinity around 20 25 psu in xiangshan bay the doc c2 c3 hix and pcas of summer dom negatively correlated with salinity while such correlations faded off during autumn and winter fig 2 meantime the dom chemistry of surrounding rivers was characterized by higher concentrations of doc with a higher degree of humification and aromaticity fig s10 suggesting significant refractory doc transported from freshwater inputs during summer it is noted that higher doc concentrations and terrestrial signatures were usually observed in coastal areas during summer than in winter due to stronger fluvial inputs from catchments during summer stedmon et al 2006 table s7 in addition huguet et al 2009 argued that doc concentrations decreased during winter due to the consumption of organic material such as the exchange between the particulate and dissolved phases following the decomposition of om however higher terrestrial signatures of dom and doc concentrations during winter were observed in xiangshan bay figs 3 4 in this regard a conceptual model was constructed to explain the seasonal differences of dom chemistry in xiangshan bay fig 7 to simplify it only biogeochemical processes during summer and winter were proposed firstly significantly higher p 0 05 intensity of protein like c1 during summer supports more freshly produced dom as a semi enclosed bay with relatively low inputs of allochthonous carbon but high inputs of inorganic nutrients autochthonously produced dom can be fueled by high concentrations of inorganic nutrients during summer markager et al 2011 similar evidence was observed from the pca fig 6 where most inorganic nutrients except for po4 3 are distributed consistently with biologically labile signatures probably implying that higher inputs of nutrients stimulate the production of autochthonous om during summer considering phosphate was reported as the primary limiting nutrient in xiangshan bay jiang et al 2019 the uptake by phytoplankton growth might lead to a slightly lower average concentration of po4 3 during summer in addition sediment pore water dom with extremely high concentrations was able to diffuse to overlying water and accordingly altered its seasonal chemical composition see discussion 4 2 which is especially the case in shallow eutrophic bays e g santos et al 2011 moreover xiangshan bay is intruded by cdw carrying intensive terrestrial signals only during winter yang et al 2018 in addition to the differences in source inputs transformation processes likely also contribute to the seasonal variations of the chemical composition of dom for instance unique molecules implied that the dom was associated with more aliphatic signatures with higher h c and lower o c during summer which was likely caused by more intensive photochemical transformation and degradation gonsior et al 2009 further examination reveals that more photo product formulae defined in stubbins et al 2010 occurred in the unique molecular formulae present during summer in xiangshan bay and jiaozhou bay see supplementary information 1 4 for details fig s11 table s8 xiangshan bay is characterized by high water stability and shallow water depth and thus dom was more susceptible to photo degradation caused by stronger light penetration during summer with high transparency as supported by the larger secchi disk depth jiang et al 2019 similarly roskilde fjord in denmark sharing dom of the aliphatic signatures was also characterized as a narrow shallow bay like xiangshan bay and dom wherein was considered to be altered by photochemical reactions during summer asmala et al 2018 4 4 implications for biogeochemical cycling in coastal bays and further considerations the chemical structure and reactivity of dom link to its influences on the co2 source sink structure amaral et al 2021 ward et al 2013 the seasonal variability of co2 emission or uptake is very high in chinese coastal bays such as the jiaozhou bay which is also a semi enclosed bay located at a temperate zone in china and its net sink of co2 linked with strong primary productivity i e photosynthesis especially in productive seasons zhang et al 2012 however more carbon fixed from the atmosphere does not necessarily lead to long term carbon sequestration jiao et al 2010 proposed that the co2 exchange on the air sea interface mentioned above is rapid cycles limited to seasonal scales to temporarily store carbon until it is ventilated to the surface again but is not functional to the long term storage of atmospheric or terrestrial om in the ocean whereas the slow cycles driven by the microbial carbon pump mcp serve to strengthen the turnover time up to millennia of oc in the ocean meantime excessive nutrients could exert a negative impact on the mcp by activating the organic matter in the ocean jiao et al 2014 2021 rosemond et al 2015 also affirmed that nutrient additions were adverse in terrestrial carbon storage from experiments in riverine ecosystems our observed seasonal variations of dom reactivity agree with the response of mcp efficiency to nutrient variations in coastal ecosystems fig 7 in summer the algal bloom stimulated by excessive nutrients might promote the decay of terrestrial dom to co2 by adding labile dom known as the priming effect bianchi 2011 lapierre et al 2013 also found a strong causal link between doc concentrations and aquatic fluxes of co2 mediated by the degradation of terrestrial derived oc in boreal aquatic ecosystems in contrast during winter the lower biological lability of dom with more aromatic and humic like signatures might be better preserved owing to its bio recalcitrant signature interestingly we noticed that there were numerous crams a significant component of refractory doc in the ocean hertkorn et al 2006 detailed in the supplementary information fig s9 table s8 within the unique formulae detected only in winter supporting the fast and active transformation of labile dom in summer and concurrent generation of more refractory molecular formulae this seasonal trend more cram formulae within the unique formulae detected only in winter was also observed in jiaozhou bay fig s12 table s8 by contrast decreasing nutrient concentration may activate the mcp and further contribute to the formation of refractory oc and carbon storage during winter fig 7 therefore nutrients should be cautiously controlled to alleviate co2 emissions by reducing dom biological lability as observed in xiangshan bay and jiaozhou bay jiao et al 2021 these contrasting scenarios may impact the regional carbon budget and should be further tested by incubation experiments and field observations in other eutrophic bays increasing parafac model data are available for further semi quantitatively evaluating the anthropogenic contributions and sources of dom in coastal bays incorporated with 7 other coastal bays distributed in temperate subtropical and tropical zones in china bohai bay jiaozhou bay sishili bay hangzhou bay zhelin bay shenzhen bay daya bay fig 1a a significant p 0 01 negative relationship between the relative proportions of protein like components in the fdom pool and average salinity across these chinese coastal bays fig 8 a positive correlation is assumed as the salinity would elevate with the addition of seawater and dom would be gradually dominated by fresh situ productions as observed in various river dominated estuaries such as the amazon river estuary and the yangtze river estuary medeiros et al 2015 seidel et al 2015 zhou et al 2021 however the negative correlation here likely implies that anthropogenic inputs substantially contribute to multiple chinese coastal bays and result in excessive protein like component contributions to the low salinity coastal bays there are still limitations existing in this case study first our discussion is mainly based on the results of the samples collected on site a comparison of the laboratory controlled degradation of seasonal dom samples and capturing their correlations with co2 emissions will be helpful to better clarify the environmental implications of dom chemistry in coastal bays secondly the chemical composition of dom in the coastal watershed near xiangshan bay still needs to be better determined for instance the submarine groundwater discharge is considered an important input in xiangshan bay wu et al 2013 peng et al 2022 and its doc fluxes and chemistry are needed further exploration to quantitatively assess the relative contributions of multiple sources to the bay finally due to the very limited volume of sediment pore water during these cruises we did not have a chance to extract it to the required concentrations to characterize its dom chemistry at a molecular level and further investigate its seasonal variations even though the above limitations require further research to the best of our knowledge by analyzing dom in the water column and surface sediments using multiple techniques we have firstly provided novel insight into the evolution of dom chemistry and the underlying controlling factors in eutrophic bays less biologically recalcitrant and more photo produced signatures of dom were found during summer in two typical semi enclosed coastal bays although our study only investigated case studies we can expect to observe a similar scenario of dom cycling in other coastal bays worldwide which are essential zones for human settlements considering the significant anthropogenic inputs to chinese coastal bays local government policies should be made to limit the external nutrient input zhang et al 2020 which may likely increase the formation of refractory dom and therefore long term carbon sequestration 5 conclusion this study documented the seasonal variations of the dom chemistry in xiangshan bay a semi enclosed eutrophic bay with high fluxes of nutrients shallow depth and long water retention time the water column dom showed higher aromaticity and humification degree from summer to winter the significant variation of dom chemistry was mainly modulated by intense primary productivity stimulated by nutrients during summer and other factors including sediment pore water dom release and photo chemical reactions we further suggest that the overall shift in dom chemistry likely reflected the response of mcp efficiency to changing nutrient supplies reduced nutrients would positively impact mcp and the formation of biologically recalcitrant dom therefore coastal bays are nonnegligible reactors to form and transport recalcitrant dom to open oceans with an increasing number of coastal bays under eutrophication status significant anthropogenic inputs were noticed in multiple chinese coastal bays further studies are encouraged to constrain the influence of eutrophication on dom chemistry and shed light on predicting and modeling the rate of carbon sequestration credit authorship contribution statement chen zhao investigation formal analysis writing

1786,as the widely distributed transition zones connecting the terrestrial and marine ecosystems coastal bays have long water retention times to reconstruct the dom pool affecting global carbon cycling however we still have a limited understanding of mechanisms shaping the carbon cycling of coastal bays at regional scales to address this issue we combined stable carbon isotopes ultraviolet visible absorption fluorescence spectroscopy and ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry to investigate the spatiotemporal chemistry of dissolved organic matter dom in xiangshan bay a semi enclosed eutrophic bay in southeastern china the dom in xiangshan bay was characterized by a higher degree of humification and aromaticity during winter whereas the inverse signature during summer results showed that the significant seasonal variation of dom chemistry was mainly modulated by intense primary productivity stimulated by nutrients during summer and other factors including sediment pore water dom release and photochemical reactions additionally based on the microbial carbon pump mcp hypothesis marine microorganisms may synthesize biologically recalcitrant dom with millennia turnover time the efficient mcp associated with reduced nutrients probably acted as a critical factor in xiangshan bay leading to the formation of additional refractory molecular formulae carboxyl rich alicyclic molecules and a more recalcitrant signature of dom during winter incorporated with seven other coastal bays across china it is revealed that anthropogenic inputs substantially contributed to chinese coastal bays further studies need to better constrain the biogeochemical implications of these anthropogenic inputs more importantly decreasing the anthropogenic input of nutrients to coastal bays may enhance their functions in long term carbon sequestration keywords dissolved organic matter molecular composition microbial carbon pump xiangshan bay estuarine carbon cycling data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction dissolved organic matter dom in the ocean is one important gaugemeter of global climate change due to its large carbon flux hedges 1992 jiao et al 2010 comparable to the atmospheric co2 reservoir 750 pg approximately 0 45 gt yr 1 terrestrial derived carbon is transported from continents to the ocean sustaining a substantial part of the global carbon budget while the transformation and fate of terrestrial organic carbon oc in the ocean remain elusive hedges et al 1997 koch et al 2005 estuaries serve as the hinge over land sea interfaces to modulate the terrestrial derived oc transport bauer et al 2013 however although biogeochemical processes associated with terrestrial derived organic matter om over the land ocean continuum have been widely studied in river dominated estuaries e g wagner et al 2015 zhou et al 2021 coastal bays have been paid less attention e g houghton 2007 compared with large river dominated estuaries coastal bays are characterized as semi enclosed transition zones connecting land and ocean usually with long water retention times zhao et al 2021 intense fusion of terrestrial and oceanic ecosystems and human disturbances would be amplified in such systems and trivial changes potentially have a significant impact on the flux of regional atmospheric co2 and long term carbon sequestration as such coastal bays are supposed to be not only conduits where om is transported to open oceans but also reactors where om is processed or transformed asmala et al 2018 specifically coastal bays are typically exposed to high fluxes of nutrients from intensive anthropogenic activities e g sewage discharges and flourishing aquaculture industries owing to their special landforms and locations near intensely populated settlements wang et al 2012 zhang et al 2020 excessive nutrients in coastal areas can bring out coastal eutrophication with high primary productivity producing fresh estuarine dom and activating the remineralization of terrestrial derived dom known as the priming effect bianchi 2011 on the other hand the microbial carbon pump mcp describes the biogeochemical processes and mechanisms that produce recalcitrant dissolved organic carbon rdoc throughout the water column jiao et al 2010 2014 these two competing mechanisms are coexistent and strengthened in coastal bays profoundly impacting the turnover time and fate of the terrestrial derived oc in the ocean previous studies have preliminarily explored the multi sources and behaviors e g physical mixing sediment resuspension and microbial photo degradation of dom in coastal bays chen and zheng 2013 sleighter and hatcher 2008 zhou et al 2019 nevertheless bearing in mind the sensitivity of dom to various ecological processes investigations for the alteration of dom in such ecosystems under the eutrophication status and its implications for carbon cycling are still limited rosemond et al 2015 schindler et al 2008 seasonal changes would significantly induce the shifts of the anthropogenic effluents groundwater infiltration and hydrological conditions and further control the fluxes of nutrients imported to coastal bays hence seasons probably serve as fundamental time scales to mediate om cycling in coastal bays uncovering the seasonal variations of dom chemistry in coastal bays can provide novel insights into regional and global estuarine carbon cycling as an intermediate medium for marine organic matter sequestration sediment pore water serves as a potential source of om to the water column for its much higher concentration especially in shallow eutrophic bays e g santos et al 2011 the interactions between the overlying water and sediment pore water dom are indispensable parts in studying the properties and fate of dom in the water column due to the considerable benthic flux of dom and significant transformation processes occurred at the water sediment interface burdige 2001 burdige et al 1999 zhou et al 2022 nevertheless limited studies have focused on seasonal variations in sources and reactivity of sediment pore water dom to further elucidate their impacts to dom transported seaward in coastal bays the chemical characterization of dom is a prerequisite to understanding its biogeochemical cycling for a comprehensive investigation of dom complexity multiple complementary analytical tools have been developed in addition to the traditional bulk approach e g stable carbon isotopes for source tracing behnke et al 2020 optical techniques e g excitation emission matrixes eems have been widely applied to the qualification and quantification of the fluorescent fraction of dom coble et al 1990 carstea et al 2016 recently the state of the art ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms allows to precisely obtain dom molecular level information which is an important determinant of its sources reactivity and transformation processes in aquatic ecosystems kurek et al 2020 qi et al 2022 integrating bulk optical and molecular characteristics can substantially improve our knowledge of dom compositions and cycling he et al 2020 kellerman et al 2015 timko et al 2014 xiangshan bay is a semi enclosed and eutrophic bay located in southeastern china to assess the variability in dom chemical composition across seasons as the largest aquaculture base in zhejiang province the inorganic nutrients in xiangshan bay have risen over the acceptable level for years yang et al 2018 jiang et al 2020 in this study we aim to i determine the seasonal variations in dom compositions of the water column and sediment pore water in xiangshan bay ii evaluate the sources and potential mechanisms shaping the dom compositions and iii explore the linkage between dom chemistry and the carbon cycling e g long term carbon sequestration in coastal bays 2 samples and analytical methods 2 1 sample collection and experimental design xiangshan bay is a long ca 60 km narrow ca 3 8 km and shallow ca 10 m depth bay which is typical of coastal ecosystems in the east china sea fig 1 a b it has three branched bays tie harbor huangdun harbor and xihu harbor the monthly variation of precipitation and temperature of xiangshan bay can be seen in fig s1 the water inside xiangshan bay originated mainly from coastal currents from adjacent coastal shelves and land runoffs amounts of rivers such as fuxi river on the top of the bay flow to xiangshan bay during summer over 60 precipitation concentrated from june to september meanwhile a proportion of changjiang diluted water cdw including changjiang river qiantang river and the surrounding watershed flows southward along the coast in winter liu et al 2021 the exchange of water and energy between xiangshan bay and the east china sea is restricted due to the prevention of by liuheng and meishan islands the upper and middle sections of this bay have long water residence times of approximately 80 and 65 days respectively for 90 of water exchanges ning and hu 2002 we selected 14 consistent stations covering xiangshan bay across the three seasons may 2019 december 2019 and october 2020 to investigate the variability of dom chemistry fig 1c the stations are the same as those in our previous investigation which only focused on the dom chemistry during summer zhao et al 2021 these 14 stations covered five sections of xiangshan bay watershed including tie harbor t1 t2 xihu harbor x1 x2 huangdun harbor h1 h2 inner harbor m1 m3 and outer harbor m4 m8 respectively significant differences in the hydrodynamics between the upper and lower bay revealed that the inner bay was dominated by gravity circulation from the bottom to the surface sea while the outer bay was mainly controlled by vertical oscillations li et al 2018 the surface and bottom water samples were collected with a niskin water collector the surface sediments c a 0 5 cm were carefully collected using a stainless steel box corer and the sediment pore water samples were immediately obtained by centrifugation 3600 r per minute 10 min within 10 h to better elucidate the source and transformation of xiangshan bay dom five surrounding freshwater river endmembers fuxi fx huangdunxi hdx shizikou szk yalinxi ylx dasongjiang dsj with salinity 0 were collected in october 2020 which entered xiangshan bay at varying locations fig 1c in addition we also collected several samples from other coastal bays in china for potential comparisons and to improve our knowledge to the carbon cycling processes in coastal bays multiple surface water samples were collected from zhelin bay 3 stations and shenzhen bay 5 stations during the summer of 2021 fig 1a surface water samples from the five consistent stations were collected in the summer july 2019 and winter january 2021 from jiaozhou bay respectively fig 1a after collecting all water samples were sequentially filtered with 0 7 μm gf f membrane pre combusted at 470 c for 5 h and 0 22 μm polycarbonate membrane filters millipore afterwards water samples were stored dark at 4

matlab 2021a platform using the domflour toolbox to separate spectral signals into several fluorescent components stedmon and bro 2008 split half and random analyses were performed to validate the number of obtained components 2 4 solid phase extraction of dom and ft icr ms analysis according to the salinity gradient and biogeochemical differences among different sections we selected surface and bottom water column samples of three representative stations h1 x2 and m8 in summer and winter seasons for ft icr ms analyses samples were analyzed using a 9 4 t bruker daltonics ft icr ms bruker apollo ii under the negative ion soft ionization jet source mode at china university of petroleum beijing china details in supplementary materials he et al 2021 compared the ionization selectivity of appi source and esi source in the analysis of nature dom and found that the average h c and o c values of srnom obtained in esi mode were the closest to the results obtained from elemental analysis multi proxies such as modified aromatic index aimod equivalent double bond number dbe island of stability index ios and molecular lability index mlbl were calculated to depict dom compositions d

were calculated between sum normalized molecular peaks where the formulae were consistently assigned and present in all samples and parafac components or optical indices stubbins et al 2014 lavonen et al 2015 the principal component analysis pca was conducted on origin software originlab usa to examine the relationships among samples and parameters 3 results 3 1 bulk geochemical parameters there are no systematic differences between the surface and bottom samples of xiangshan bay and the average values of bulk and optical dom parameters at each station are shown in table s1 the average seawater salinity ranged from 20 4 to 25 7 psu the average doc concentrations of the water column during summer autumn and winter were 1 3 0 2 mg l 1 1 3 0 1 mg l 1 and 1 7 0 4 mg l 1 respectively and the variations of water column doc along with salinity in varying seasons were shown in fig 2 the average doc concentrations of sediment pore water during summer autumn and winter were 10 4 4 5 mg l 1 19 6 13 1 mg l 1 and 13 0 10 7 mg l 1 respectively table s2 the δ13c values of spe dom of water column samples varied from 26 3 to 24 6 for soluble nutrients the concentrations of sio3 2 no3 and nh4 were all significantly higher p 0 05 in summer whereas there was no significant difference for po4 3 p 0 05 fig s2 3 2 optical properties of cdom fdom the cdom parameters s275 295 and sr for water column were 0 014 0 026 nm 1 and 0 67 2 71 respectively and for sediment pore water were 0 014 0 046 nm 1 and 0 88 4 88 respectively the fdom parameters hix fi and bix for water column were 0 42 0 62 1 57 1 78 and 0 94 1 09 respectively and for sediment pore water were 0 23 0 80 1 80 2 50 and 0 77 1 45 respectively table s1 three fluorescent components were obtained by parafac analysis fig s3 we compared the fluorescent components acquired in this study with the openfluor online platform details in supplementary materials 1 2 one protein like c1 ex 250 nm em 300 nm and two humic like c2 ex 250 nm em 450 nm c3 ex 275 350 nm em 450 nm components were identified by parafac modeling with 161 water column and sediment pore water samples the average relative proportions of protein like components in water column fdom gradually decreased from summer 50 to autumn 39 and winter 37 the seasonal decoupling variations of optical indices were shown between the water column and sediment pore water dom the relative proportion of protein like components c1 c1 of the water column was significantly higher p 0 05 during summer than that during autumn and winter whereas the hix values c2 and c3 indicative of humification and aromaticity degree were significantly lower p 0 05 than that during autumn and winter fig 3 there was no significant optical indices difference between autumn and winter p 0 05 meanwhile for the sediment pore water dom no significant variations p 0 05 were observed between the summer and autumn for all fluorescent components however it is noted that a sharp change from labile to the aromatic signature of sediment pore water dom was shown from autumn to winter 3 3 molecular compositions of dom as revealed by ft icr ms ft icr ms analysis showed that a total of 11 299 formulae were assigned in the twelve samples during the summer and winter 8217 and 9403 unique formulae were detected in the summer and winter in their respective six spe dom samples 6321 molecular formulae were detected in both the summer and winter i e at least occurred one each in the summer or winter samples which accounted for 77 and 67 by number of unique formulae in the summer and winter respectively moreover 2783 common molecular formulae were constantly detected in all twelve spe dom samples regarding heteroatom containing compounds 3090 and 3858 chon unique formulae were detected during summer and winter respectively the average relative intensity of chon formulae during winter 18 6 0 3 was significantly higher p 0 05 than that during summer 15 2 1 5 1233 and 1115 chos formulae were detected during summer and winter respectively the average relative intensity of chos formulae during summer 12 9 4 9 was significantly higher p 0 05 than that during winter 5 7 1 8 molecular parameters displayed that winter dom had significantly p 0 05 higher o c aimod dbe and ios and lower h c mlbl than those during summer table s3 and fig 4 for compound group fractions the significantly higher p 0 05 relative intensity of pcas polyphenols and hu compounds occurred during winter by contrast the higher relative intensity of ua and peptides compounds occurred during summer table s4 unique formulae only present during summer or winter can further assist in evaluating the spatiotemporal variations of dom chemistry at a molecular level table s5 more unique formulae were present during winter 3082 vs 1896 while unique formulae only present during summer were related to more bio labile signatures with higher h c higher relative abundances of ua and peptide compounds and lower o c in contrast to formulae only present during winter a switch from more labile marine dom to more aromatic terrestrial dom could be observed from summer to winter fig 5 and temporal differences overwhelmed spatial differences huangdun harbor xihu harbor and outer harbor as shown in the van krevelen v k diagrams fig s4 it should be noticed that a fraction of unique formulae to summer or winter were only present once in all samples to ensure a more reliable understanding of seasonal variations of unique formulae we compared the unique formulae with different occurrences present only or more than once in all samples on v k diagrams fig s5 the results reveal that even for unique formulae that were only present once in all samples the difference between summer and winter are consistent with previous observations for unconstrained unique formulae confirming the dom seasonal variations in addition to analyses of unique formulae we also applied the inter sample ranking analyses for 2783 common formulae to understand dom variations between summer and winter and among spatial stations chen et al 2021 herzsprung et al 2017 she et al 2021 in order to better understand the spatiotemporal variations of dom surface dom samples from three regions in each season were displayed in v k diagrams fig s6 results confirm that seasonal dom quality differences dominate over spatial differences the molecular formulae in the higher ranks e g rank 1 3 relatively higher molecular relative intensities of summer samples displayed higher h c and lower o c while the formulae in the higher ranks of winter samples exhibited lower h c and higher o c in general the analyses to unique formulae and common formulae provide a consistent view of the dom seasonal variations in xiangshan bay 3 4 pca and spearman s rank correlation analyses the pca was conducted to assess the principal factors mediating seasonal variations of water column dom composition considering the continuous variations of dom chemistry from summer to winter we analyzed samples from two endmember seasons of summer and winter first all water column dom samples were analyzed by using bulk and optical indices fig 6 a twelve selected samples for ft icr ms analysis were then analyzed by using bulk optical and molecular indices fig 6b and two principal components pc1 and pc2 were identified and accounted for 51 3 and 17 2 of the total variations respectively fig 6b positive loadings along pc1 are related to humification associated indices e g aimod dbe ios and hix humic like fluorescent components e g c2 and c3 and aromatic molecular groups e g pcas polyphenols in contrast negative loadings along pc1 are mainly associated with biologically labile and aliphatic indices e g bix fi c1 ua peptides the sum normalized intensities of 2783 common formulae detected in all twelve spe dom samples were chosen for spearman s rank correlation analysis and 1642 formulae could correlate with at least one fluorescent component moreover 564 overlapped formulae correlated with humic like c2 and c3 components which accounted for 82 and 93 of their correlated formulae respectively suggesting the similarity between c2 and c3 components from a molecular perspective even though they were identified as two independent fluorescent components adversely the protein like c1 and humic like c2 or c3 components did not share any correlated formulae the correlated formulae for each component were plotted in v k diagrams fig s7 and the detailed information was shown in the supplementary materials fig s8 and table s6 results also show that the c1 component correlated with formulae with higher h c lower o c and more ua and peptides compounds whereas c2 and c3 components correlated with formulae with lower h c higher o c and more pcas polyphenols and heteroatomic compounds 4 discussion 4 1 seasonal variations in dom sources of the water column in xiangshan bay the stable carbon isotopic compositions of dom in three seasons table s1 all showed a mixing signature from terrestrial e g higher plant vegetation and soil erosion and marine e g in situ production or exudation by phytoplankton inputs cloern et al 2002 notably the dom from two stations located at the inner tie harbor and huangdun harbor t1 and h1 station has lower δ13c than other locations in summer which is probably explained by terrestrial inputs from inland rivers e g fuxi river the values of hix 0 42 0 62 s275 295 0 014 0 026 nm 1 and fi 1 57 1 78 table s1 which were previously used to determine the aromaticity degree or molecular mass of dom to discriminate terrestrial vs microbial sources exhibited similar ranges to those observed in other coastal bays such as laizhou bay jiang et al 2017 and bohai bay chen and zheng 2013 also suggesting allochthonous and autochthonous sources of dom in xiangshan bay moreover the optical indices hix c1 c2 and c3 fig 3a d molecular parameters h c o c aimod dbe ios mlbl and the relative intensities of pcas polyphenols hu and ua compounds fig 4 collectively indicate that the dom during winter was characterized as higher degrees of humification and aromaticity although cdom fdom and spe dom could only partly represent the whole dom pool the optical approaches and ft icr ms complement each other and thus provide an integrated view and strong evidence of changes in dom sources and composition among seasons the parafac components or optical indices were linked with formulae of ft icr ms through correlation analyses to determine their representatives to dom chemistry in inland or marine systems from a molecular perspective thus better constraining the dom cycling stubbins et al 2014 wagner et al 2015 applying this method to coastal bays can further explore and improve its applicability in aquatic environments it is revealed that c1 c3 components can represent most formulae 59 under current spe protocols and ft icr ms conditions the association between the protein like c1 with aliphatic molecular indices in this study further confirms the agreement of optical and molecular techniques to dom characterization and vice versa fig s7 s8 interestingly protein like c1 correlated with formulae with higher molecular mass which is interpreted as two potential reasons one possibility is that considering strictly common formulae were chosen for spearman s correlation analysis these formulae likely represented at least semi labile molecules whose turnover time was over several months and the smaller labile peptides with lower molecular mass compounds had been excluded alternatively c1 could be partly sourced from the degradation of larger peptides coble et al 1990 while those larger peptides with higher molecular mass compounds were beyond the analytical window by ft icr ms molecular weight 800 da here the heteroatomic compounds chon chos and chons compounds can be linked with protein like or humic like components in different aquatic ecosystems suggesting their complexity of sources stubbins et al 2014 he et al 2020 the enrichment of heteroatomic formulae was usually associated with the microbially derived dom especially in reduced environments sleighter and hatcher 2008 medeiros et al 2015 alternatively abundant chos compounds were likely the result of anthropogenic inputs considering they are much more abundant in anthropogenically perturbated wastewater discharge than in natural environments gonsior et al 2011 he et al 2019 further examination reveals that o3s and o5s compounds were likely associated with surface active chemicals such as dialkyl tetralin sulfonates dats and alkyl benzene sulfonates las gonsior et al 2011 wagner et al 2015 and their high relative intensity resulted in the non normal distribution of chos class in both seasons fig s9a b comparing of seasons reveals that chos class deviated from normal distribution to a larger extent during summer as well as the sharp decrease 34 to 3 of relative intensities of unique chos formulae in the h1 station near huangdunxi river from summer to winter table s5 moreover the decreasing trend of the relative intensity of chos formulae with salinity was only observed in summer table s4 and fig s9c d probably resulting from the dilution of seawater and or degradation of heterotrophic microbes osterholz et al 2016 therefore these temporal and spatial distribution patterns of chos compounds suggest that they were mainly from fluvial inputs with intensive anthropogenic signals 4 2 seasonal variations in sediment pore water dom in xiangshan bay sediment pore water dom has been considered as an intermediate of sediment oc preservation burdige et al 1999 and nutrients regeneration from sediment particulate organic matter pom remineralization can provide a substantial fraction of nutrients to fuel primary productivity cowan and boynton 1996 meantime the concentrations of pore water are usually several times higher than those in overlying seawater due to the degradation of pom in sediments burdige et al 1999 chen and hur 2015 which is also the case in xiangshan bay table s2 thus likely diffusing to the overlying water column to alter the chemical compositions of water dom burdige and komada 2015 the sediment pore water has significantly characterized the dom pool larger range of optical parameters as divergent from that of the water column fig 3 a plausible reason is that compared with the water column pore water stored in sediments was relatively poorly mixed and its compositional chemistry was largely dependent on the biogeochemical processes occurring at small spatial scales burdige and komada 2015 singer et al 2010 many studies have shown different chemical characteristics of sediments pore water dom and mostly suggested that it was characterized as more humic like and aromatic signatures than overlying water in chesapeake bay liaohe wetland and boreal lakes burdige 2001 lu et al 2020 valle et al 2020 while recent studies in the east china sea reported that sediment pore water dom can be alternatively dominated by microbial activities such as the virus lysis in sediments and bacterial metabolisms li et al 2020 zhou et al 2022 in xiangshan bay seasonal variations of dom chemistry in sediment pore water were observed to mimic the overlying water column fig 3 tables s1 s2 however to a more considerable extent a drastic change from labile to aromatic signature of the sediment pore water dom was shown from autumn to winter this decoupling trend between the water column and sediment pore water dom was interpreted as following processes firstly amounts of freshly aliphatic dom were produced by phytoplankton and preserved in sediment pore water under the eutrophication status during summer nutrient supplies from sediment regeneration could also promote microbial metabolisms in sediments and the accumulation of labile dom in sediment pore water during summer kaiser and benner 2008 zhang et al 2019 afterward with the more unfavorable condition e g temperature nutrients for phytoplankton growth during autumn the debris of dead phytoplankton would settle down to sediments resulting in comparable labile signals in sediment pore water dom thornton 2014 moreover the aquaculture industry in xiangshan bay especially the fish cage requires numerous nutrients jiang et al 2013 it is reported that over 50 of nutrients feed cannot be utilized by fish islam 2005 wu 1995 causing remaining nutrients and labile compounds to circulate in the water column and settle down into sediments finally accumulated labile dom would be gradually transformed to aromatic dom by benthic microbes during winter burdige 2001 reader et al 2019 this explanation is supported by the incubation experiments which proved that approximately 50 of sediment pore water doc was consumed within two days with the succession of microbial community and residual recalcitrant dom cai et al 2019 4 3 seasonal controls on dom chemistry in xiangshan bay pca shows that dom pools from each compartment i e summer and winter seasons were more analogous among themselves than pools from different compartments across xiangshan bay fig 6a b therefore the seasonal variation of dom chemistry is more significant than the spatial variation even across the whole xiangshan bay the pc1 separates samples well and likely represents the season variable pc2 has positive loadings on several indices associated with anthropogenic inputs fig 6b including nutrients no2 no3 sio3 2 optical indices fi o3s o5s compounds and pyrogenic molecular group pcas bao et al 2012 stubbins et al 2012 dong and rosario ortiz 2012 proposed that abnormally high fi was likely caused by domestic wastewater imprinted with human activities also summer samples from huangdun harbor near the river hdx had very positive pc2 scores indicating that stations inner the bay suffered from strong anthropogenic signals through surrounding rivers fig 6b d as collaborated by our discussion of the spatiotemporal distribution of chos compounds although there is a narrow range of salinity around 20 25 psu in xiangshan bay the doc c2 c3 hix and pcas of summer dom negatively correlated with salinity while such correlations faded off during autumn and winter fig 2 meantime the dom chemistry of surrounding rivers was characterized by higher concentrations of doc with a higher degree of humification and aromaticity fig s10 suggesting significant refractory doc transported from freshwater inputs during summer it is noted that higher doc concentrations and terrestrial signatures were usually observed in coastal areas during summer than in winter due to stronger fluvial inputs from catchments during summer stedmon et al 2006 table s7 in addition huguet et al 2009 argued that doc concentrations decreased during winter due to the consumption of organic material such as the exchange between the particulate and dissolved phases following the decomposition of om however higher terrestrial signatures of dom and doc concentrations during winter were observed in xiangshan bay figs 3 4 in this regard a conceptual model was constructed to explain the seasonal differences of dom chemistry in xiangshan bay fig 7 to simplify it only biogeochemical processes during summer and winter were proposed firstly significantly higher p 0 05 intensity of protein like c1 during summer supports more freshly produced dom as a semi enclosed bay with relatively low inputs of allochthonous carbon but high inputs of inorganic nutrients autochthonously produced dom can be fueled by high concentrations of inorganic nutrients during summer markager et al 2011 similar evidence was observed from the pca fig 6 where most inorganic nutrients except for po4 3 are distributed consistently with biologically labile signatures probably implying that higher inputs of nutrients stimulate the production of autochthonous om during summer considering phosphate was reported as the primary limiting nutrient in xiangshan bay jiang et al 2019 the uptake by phytoplankton growth might lead to a slightly lower average concentration of po4 3 during summer in addition sediment pore water dom with extremely high concentrations was able to diffuse to overlying water and accordingly altered its seasonal chemical composition see discussion 4 2 which is especially the case in shallow eutrophic bays e g santos et al 2011 moreover xiangshan bay is intruded by cdw carrying intensive terrestrial signals only during winter yang et al 2018 in addition to the differences in source inputs transformation processes likely also contribute to the seasonal variations of the chemical composition of dom for instance unique molecules implied that the dom was associated with more aliphatic signatures with higher h c and lower o c during summer which was likely caused by more intensive photochemical transformation and degradation gonsior et al 2009 further examination reveals that more photo product formulae defined in stubbins et al 2010 occurred in the unique molecular formulae present during summer in xiangshan bay and jiaozhou bay see supplementary information 1 4 for details fig s11 table s8 xiangshan bay is characterized by high water stability and shallow water depth and thus dom was more susceptible to photo degradation caused by stronger light penetration during summer with high transparency as supported by the larger secchi disk depth jiang et al 2019 similarly roskilde fjord in denmark sharing dom of the aliphatic signatures was also characterized as a narrow shallow bay like xiangshan bay and dom wherein was considered to be altered by photochemical reactions during summer asmala et al 2018 4 4 implications for biogeochemical cycling in coastal bays and further considerations the chemical structure and reactivity of dom link to its influences on the co2 source sink structure amaral et al 2021 ward et al 2013 the seasonal variability of co2 emission or uptake is very high in chinese coastal bays such as the jiaozhou bay which is also a semi enclosed bay located at a temperate zone in china and its net sink of co2 linked with strong primary productivity i e photosynthesis especially in productive seasons zhang et al 2012 however more carbon fixed from the atmosphere does not necessarily lead to long term carbon sequestration jiao et al 2010 proposed that the co2 exchange on the air sea interface mentioned above is rapid cycles limited to seasonal scales to temporarily store carbon until it is ventilated to the surface again but is not functional to the long term storage of atmospheric or terrestrial om in the ocean whereas the slow cycles driven by the microbial carbon pump mcp serve to strengthen the turnover time up to millennia of oc in the ocean meantime excessive nutrients could exert a negative impact on the mcp by activating the organic matter in the ocean jiao et al 2014 2021 rosemond et al 2015 also affirmed that nutrient additions were adverse in terrestrial carbon storage from experiments in riverine ecosystems our observed seasonal variations of dom reactivity agree with the response of mcp efficiency to nutrient variations in coastal ecosystems fig 7 in summer the algal bloom stimulated by excessive nutrients might promote the decay of terrestrial dom to co2 by adding labile dom known as the priming effect bianchi 2011 lapierre et al 2013 also found a strong causal link between doc concentrations and aquatic fluxes of co2 mediated by the degradation of terrestrial derived oc in boreal aquatic ecosystems in contrast during winter the lower biological lability of dom with more aromatic and humic like signatures might be better preserved owing to its bio recalcitrant signature interestingly we noticed that there were numerous crams a significant component of refractory doc in the ocean hertkorn et al 2006 detailed in the supplementary information fig s9 table s8 within the unique formulae detected only in winter supporting the fast and active transformation of labile dom in summer and concurrent generation of more refractory molecular formulae this seasonal trend more cram formulae within the unique formulae detected only in winter was also observed in jiaozhou bay fig s12 table s8 by contrast decreasing nutrient concentration may activate the mcp and further contribute to the formation of refractory oc and carbon storage during winter fig 7 therefore nutrients should be cautiously controlled to alleviate co2 emissions by reducing dom biological lability as observed in xiangshan bay and jiaozhou bay jiao et al 2021 these contrasting scenarios may impact the regional carbon budget and should be further tested by incubation experiments and field observations in other eutrophic bays increasing parafac model data are available for further semi quantitatively evaluating the anthropogenic contributions and sources of dom in coastal bays incorporated with 7 other coastal bays distributed in temperate subtropical and tropical zones in china bohai bay jiaozhou bay sishili bay hangzhou bay zhelin bay shenzhen bay daya bay fig 1a a significant p 0 01 negative relationship between the relative proportions of protein like components in the fdom pool and average salinity across these chinese coastal bays fig 8 a positive correlation is assumed as the salinity would elevate with the addition of seawater and dom would be gradually dominated by fresh situ productions as observed in various river dominated estuaries such as the amazon river estuary and the yangtze river estuary medeiros et al 2015 seidel et al 2015 zhou et al 2021 however the negative correlation here likely implies that anthropogenic inputs substantially contribute to multiple chinese coastal bays and result in excessive protein like component contributions to the low salinity coastal bays there are still limitations existing in this case study first our discussion is mainly based on the results of the samples collected on site a comparison of the laboratory controlled degradation of seasonal dom samples and capturing their correlations with co2 emissions will be helpful to better clarify the environmental implications of dom chemistry in coastal bays secondly the chemical composition of dom in the coastal watershed near xiangshan bay still needs to be better determined for instance the submarine groundwater discharge is considered an important input in xiangshan bay wu et al 2013 peng et al 2022 and its doc fluxes and chemistry are needed further exploration to quantitatively assess the relative contributions of multiple sources to the bay finally due to the very limited volume of sediment pore water during these cruises we did not have a chance to extract it to the required concentrations to characterize its dom chemistry at a molecular level and further investigate its seasonal variations even though the above limitations require further research to the best of our knowledge by analyzing dom in the water column and surface sediments using multiple techniques we have firstly provided novel insight into the evolution of dom chemistry and the underlying controlling factors in eutrophic bays less biologically recalcitrant and more photo produced signatures of dom were found during summer in two typical semi enclosed coastal bays although our study only investigated case studies we can expect to observe a similar scenario of dom cycling in other coastal bays worldwide which are essential zones for human settlements considering the significant anthropogenic inputs to chinese coastal bays local government policies should be made to limit the external nutrient input zhang et al 2020 which may likely increase the formation of refractory dom and therefore long term carbon sequestration 5 conclusion this study documented the seasonal variations of the dom chemistry in xiangshan bay a semi enclosed eutrophic bay with high fluxes of nutrients shallow depth and long water retention time the water column dom showed higher aromaticity and humification degree from summer to winter the significant variation of dom chemistry was mainly modulated by intense primary productivity stimulated by nutrients during summer and other factors including sediment pore water dom release and photo chemical reactions we further suggest that the overall shift in dom chemistry likely reflected the response of mcp efficiency to changing nutrient supplies reduced nutrients would positively impact mcp and the formation of biologically recalcitrant dom therefore coastal bays are nonnegligible reactors to form and transport recalcitrant dom to open oceans with an increasing number of coastal bays under eutrophication status significant anthropogenic inputs were noticed in multiple chinese coastal bays further studies are encouraged to constrain the influence of eutrophication on dom chemistry and shed light on predicting and modeling the rate of carbon sequestration credit authorship contribution statement chen zhao investigation formal analysis writing

1787,coastal wetlands are considered as efficient barriers for pollutants such as dissolved metal loid s between land and sea however there remains a challenge in understanding how tidal hydrology regulates the source sink patterns of metal loid s across the sediment water interface especially in the salt marsh mangrove ecotone that commonly exists in subtropical coastlines in this study we conducted detailed time series observations of dissolved metal loid s cr cu zn ba pb hg and as and organic matter dom characteristics bulk concentrations aromaticity and molecular size in southeast china over a spring neap tidal cycle the results demonstrated that both dom and metal loid s fluctuated with tide levels and higher concentrations exited in groundwater than that in the surface water the concentrations of bulk dom and chromophoric dom both in surface water varied oppositely with tide levels suggesting the potential role of groundwater discharge at low tides dom aromaticity also had tidal time scale fluctuations but the molecular weight of dom was insensitive to tide changes the dispersion fluxes were one to four orders of magnitude lower than advective fluxes with the ranges of 0 14 24 8 μg m 2 d 1 for cr 6 2 22 4 μg m 2 d 1 for cu 14 7 387 4 μg m 2 d 1 for zn 0 7 25 4 μg m 2 d 1 for as 259 2 2308 μg m 2 d 1 for ba 0 1 6 0 μg m 2 d 1 for pb 0 1 7 μg m 2 d 1 for hg and 3 1 116 mg m 2 d 1 for dom respectively mangrove sediments tended to be the sources of dom and all dissolved metal loid s but the salt marsh was only the source of cu as and dom these results have implications on the geochemical cycling of dom and dissolved metal loid s in the salt marsh mangrove ecotone which has contrasting pattern of surface water groundwater exchange keywords blue carbon system tidal creek trace metals zhangjiang estuary advection diffusion model sediment water interface data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction coastal wetlands such as salt marsh and mangrove can bury massive organic carbon in sediments than they naturally release although they only occupy 5 of the global land area and 2 of the ocean area they store roughly 50 carbon buried in ocean sediments duarte et al 2005 salt marsh and mangrove can live together in the temperate tropical climatic transition zone in asia africa australia and north and south america saintilan et al 2014 feller et al 2017 kelleway et al 2017 forming the unique marsh mangrove ecotone yando et al 2016 kimball and eash loucks 2021 in china the spartina alterniflora dominated salt marsh was introduced in the late 1970 s to reduce coastal erosion but has spread southward by about 19 of latitude in the last two decades invading mangrove due to marsh s stronger reproduction capacity an et al 2007 zhang et al 2012 currently information is lacking on the potential impacts of marsh encroachment into native mangrove habitats on biogeochemical cycling feller et al 2017 kelleway et al 2017 salt marsh and mangrove can play a key role in buffering pollutants such as dissolved metals and metalloids hereafter metal loid s from the land to coastal water anjum et al 2014 rajaram et al 2020 due to the metal loid toxicities to organisms and human beings metal loid cycling has been recognized as a serious question during the last few decades jaishankar et al 2014 geronimo et al 2021 police et al 2021 recently li et al 2022 systematically investigated the heavy metal pollution of global coastal wetlands through analyzing 3 000 articles published over the past three decades they found that the heavy metal pollution of global coastal wetlands has gradually increased due to the rapid development of coastal human activities but most previous studies focused on metal distributions in sediments li et al 2022 in addition most of the studies were conducted in independent ecosystems rather than symbiotic plant systems li et al 2022 because different species in coastal wetlands often interact to form communities pennings and he 2021 furthermore few studies investigated the vertical transport of metal loid s across the sediment water interface hereafter swi through either advective flow sanders et al 2015 holloway et al 2016 or passive diffusion blasco et al 2000 warnken et al 2001 which not only depend on sediment characteristics kaly et al 1997 but also on tidal hydrology qu et al 2020 and plant types that control the wetland morphology shaffer and kandalepas 2016 dissolved organic matter dom in coastal wetlands can affect the environmental behaviors of dissolved metal loid s in aquatic environments e g webb et al 2019 zhang et al 2022 the dom usually contains various amounts of o containing functional groups e g carboxylic and phenolic groups and n s containing functional groups e g amide and thiol groups these groups can have strong affinities for dissolved metal loid s through a series of reactions such as ion exchange adsorption redox complexation and methylation to stabilize or release metal loid s polubesova and chefetz 2014 dom can also directly affect the water color in ion flocculation and deteriorate the water quality by combining with mineral ions herzsprung et al 2012 moreover the chromophoric dom cdom that readily absorbs solar ultraviolet uv and visible radiation blough et al 1993 can also affect water optics and generate reactive oxygen species that alter the migration and transformation of dissolved metal loid s mopper and kieber 2002 although dom and metal loid s can interact in water columns mcdonough et al 2020 the time series of observations on dom metal loid s interactions in the salt marsh mangrove ecotone were rarely reported thanh nho et al 2020 the salt marsh invading mangrove can influence creek bank slope kimball and eash loucks 2021 and further change the vertically advective flow and fluxes of dissolved nutrients wang et al 2022 thus we hypothesized that the spatiotemporal distributions of dom and dissolved metal loid s including chromium cr copper cu zinc zn arsenic as barium ba lead pb and mercury hg will greatly vary with plant types and tidal types in the marsh mangrove ecotone to test this hypothesis we carried out time series observations of dom and dissolved metal loid s in surface water and groundwater during a spring neap tidal cycle the field campaigns were conducted on the southeast china coastline where a subtropical mangrove wetland was invaded by salt marsh the specific objectives of this study were 1 to estimate contrasting fluxes of dissolved metal loid s and dom through the advective flow and passive diffusion across the swi 2 to explore the interplay among tidal hydrology dissolved metal loid s and dom characteristics and 3 to explore the potential implication of salt marsh invasion to the vertical source sink patterns of dissolved metal loid s 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the study site the study site is located in the natural mangrove reserve 117 24 117 30 e 23 53 23 56 n in the zhangjiang estuary fujian china fig 1 the zhangjiang estuary links the semi enclosed dongshan bay and surface water flows into the taiwan strait the mangrove reserve has an area of 2 6 km2 which is comprised of three primary areas an upper area dominated by avicennia marina kandelia obovata and aegiceras corniculatum mangrove species a middle area occupied by the invasive spartina alterniflora and a lower area with bare mudflat environment wu et al 2021 the invasive area has increased to 1 4 km2 over the last 30 years dong et al 2020 the mangrove reserve belongs to a monsoon climate pattern exhibiting annual precipitation of 1714 5 mm and annual temperature of 21 2 c respectively http www chinaflux org tides were semidiurnal with a tidal range of 0 43 to 4 67 m and a mean tidal range of 2 32 m zhang et al 2013 2 2 monitoring and sampling campaigns field campaigns were conducted along a winding tidal creek fig 1 the field approaches consisted of 1 time series observations of groundwater level and tidal level around the creek bank to estimate advective flow rate across the swi and 2 sampling surface water and groundwater to characterize the bulk concentrations and characteristics of dom and dissolved metal loid s two field campaigns occurred on two occasions including one day during neap tides on 10th october 2020 and another day during spring tides on 20th october 2020 each campaign has a total of 25 to 28 hourly observations and samplings the approach for quantifying the advective flow rates relied on the generalized darcy s law and hydraulic data from two so called paired wells installed along the creek banks of the salt marsh and mangrove wang et al 2022 surface waters 50 cm below the water air interface were collected per hour using a pre decontaminated niskin hydrophore on a boat anchored in the middle location of the tidal creek in addition groundwater was collected hourly from self designed groundwater sampling wells at depths of 25 50 cm using a peristaltic pump wang et al 2022 while our groundwater sampling approach cannot resolve fine scale vertical distributions required to interpret metal loid s geochemistry this approach allows for surrounding sediment porewater to fill up the sampling well to represent an integrated value of the groundwater endmember exchanging with surface waters by either advective flow and or passive diffusion on tidal time scales a total of 160 water samples were collected during two sampling periods including 105 surface water samples and 55 groundwater samples all water samples were filtered with a whatman gf f 0 7 μm glass membrane pre combusted at 450 for 4 5 h and the in situ salinity dissolved oxygen do and ph values were measured using a portable meter multi 3430 germany water samples were divided into two kinds of washed bottles for dom the water samples were stored in a 50 ml brown glass bottle acidified using concentrated suprapurr hcl for dissolved metal loid s the water samples were immediately transferred into acid precleaned polypropylene bottles 50 ml and then acidified to ph 2 using concentrated suprapurr hno3 for sample preservation strady et al 2009 all samples were sent to the laboratory at a low temperature 4 before further processing 2 3 laboratory analysis the bulk doc concentration as the primary proxy of dom was analyzed using the total organic carbon analyzer shimadzu japan we measured the absorbance of the samples using an ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer with a 1 cm quartz cuvette and milli q water as reference the specific ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm suva254 was used to indicate dom aromaticity and calculated by dividing the absorbance at 254 nm a254 by the doc concentration weishaar et al 2003 we calculated the ratio of the absorbance at 254 nm to that at 365 nm as the e2 e3 which usually has a negative correlation with the molecular weight of dom wang et al 2018 the a350 was selected as a proxy of cdom concentration and was calculated as 2 303 a350 l where a350 and l were the measured optical density at 350 nm and cuvette length respectively spencer et al 2013 the concentrations of dissolved metals cr cu zn ba pb and hg and metalloid as were determined using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms thermo fisher scientific usa each sample was detected by three times with the relative standard deviation of the replicates being 10 blanks milli q water suffering the same preparation procedure were set in every ten samples during the analysis the recoveries of dissolved metal loid s ranged from 80 to 100 and the detection limits had a range of 0 01 0 05 μg l depending on the metal loid species 2 4 advection diffusion model the advection diffusion model was used to calculate the tidal exchange of dom and dissolved metal loid s across the swi by considering advective flow and passive diffusion the advective flux fadv could be determined by examining the sediment saturated hydraulic conductivity hydraulic gradient between two paired wells and solute concentrations in surface water or groundwater 1 f adv k v j c i where kv is the vertical hydraulic conductivity of saturated sediments l t 1 obtained from the in situ falling head method wang et al 2014 j is the hydraulic gradient between two paired wells if j 0 the groundwater flows vertically upward through the sediments otherwise j 0 the seawater infiltrates the sediments more details about the calculations of j were given in wang et al 2022 thus the hourly advective flow is the product of kv and hourly j ci is the hourly concentration of ith solute in groundwater j 0 or surface water j 0 the passive diffusion flux fdiff between sediment groundwater and the overlying water was estimated based on fick s law 2 f diff φ 0 d s c i z i where φ 0 was the porosity that was expressed as the water volume fraction in the wet sediment by identifying the weight difference between wet sediment samples before and after drying at 60 ds cm2d 1 was the diffusion coefficient of dissolved solutes c i z i was the concentration gradient between groundwater and the overlying surface water ds was corrected for porosity φ 0 from the molecular diffusion coefficient d0 of a free solute table s1 ullman and sandstrom 1987 put forward the following empirical correlation of ds with φ 0 3 d s φ 0 d 0 φ 0 0 7 φ 2 2 d 0 φ 0 0 7 where d0 is the molecular diffusion coefficient for the targeted element table s1 according to the above calculations negative advective and diffusive fluxes reflect sediment uptake processes i e downward fluxes in contrast positive fluxes indicate benthic recycling i e outward fluxes from groundwater to surface waters 2 5 statistics the differences in hydrochemical parameters tide level ph do and salinity concentrations of dissolved metal loid s cr cu zn ba pb hg and as and dom characteristic parameters doc concentration a350 suva254 and e2 e3 among water types surface water and groundwater plant types salt marsh and mangrove and tidal types spring and neap tides were analyzed by analysis of variance anova and tukey s honestly significant difference test after logarithmic transformation of the non normal data the pearson correlation analysis was also applied to explore the mutual relations among the above parameters as the kaiser meyer olkin and bartlett tests were satisfied principal component analysis pca was applied for reducing the dimensions of variables in surface water and groundwater the loading and score of each sample were obtained the significance level was set at p 0 05 for all statistical analyses the above statistical analyses were performed using spss software version 22 0 3 results 3 1 time series of hydrochemical parameters and dom characteristics there were marked temporal variations for all hydrochemical parameters including salinity 11 6 24 7 psu do 0 4 8 6 mg l and ph 6 6 10 9 during the time series of observations at all sites fig 2 no rainfall was recorded prior to or during the observation period trends in salinity do and ph values followed tidal cycles that is they reached their peak and lowest values at high and low tides respectively the high salinity observed at high tides demonstrated that these systems behave as normal tidal creeks with tidally varying salinity in surface water xiao et al 2019a in addition the salinity had a similar variable range between surface water and groundwater at all sites and both were significantly larger during spring tides than that during neap tides table s2 however the do and ph have significant comparability only in surface water in different tidal types p 0 05 the values of do and ph in groundwater were also significantly lower than that in surface water p 0 05 indicating that groundwater was a low oxygen and more acidic water environment compared with surface water the temporal variation trends of dom concentration 2 0 16 1 mg l in surface water and 2 3 21 4 mg l in groundwater were the opposite with salinity i e slightly larger at low tides than at high tides both in surface water and groundwater this suggested that the groundwater derived dom and or external dom sources from the upstream freshwater inputs contributed to the increase of surface water dom concentration at low tides the cdom showed a similar trend to dom indicating that cdom can absorb more solar ultraviolet and visible radiation at low tides the suva254 indicating dom aromaticity showed a similar trend to dom and cdom during neap tides but became the opposite during spring tides the e2 e3 which is usually negatively correlated with the dom molecular weight did not show an obvious pattern of regular tidal variations but showed a jagged fluctuation trend with tide level indicating that the dom molecular weight was driven by other factors with shorter time scales finally most of the above dom characteristics showed that the variability ranges were significantly higher during spring tides than during neap tides table 1 indicating the major control of tidal hydrology 3 2 time series of dissolved metal loid s characteristics in terms of temporal changes the concentrations of dissolved metal loid s varied with tidal types water types and plant types fig 3 and table 2 unlike physico chemical parameters and dom characteristics tidal variations of dissolved metal loid s were not visually obvious for example cr concentration 0 04 5 8 μg l 1 in mangrove surface water changed periodically with tidal levels in the first tidal cycle but the regularity was not sustained in the second tidal cycle cu concentration 0 17 16 3 μg l 1 in mangrove surface water changed periodically with tidal levels throughout only the neap tides ba concentration 49 358 3 μg l 1 negatively correlated with tidal level during most of the observation period likely indicating that ba was released from sediments into groundwater and then discharged into tidal creek at low tides pb concentration 0 3 1 μg l 1 has no obvious regularity but the concentrations of some samples both in surface water and groundwater were less than the detection limit of equipment during neap tides zn 3 38 346 0 μg l 1 as 0 55 2 8 μg l 1 and hg 0 0 85 μg l 1 concentrations did not change significantly with tidal levels from a statistical point of view between neap tides and spring tides there was no uniform regularities between the average concentration of dissolved metal loid s and water type or plant type table 1 for example most of cr and as concentrations were significantly lower during neap than those during spring tides p 0 05 cu in salt marsh p 0 05 and ba in mangrove p 0 05 during neap tides were significantly lower than those during spring tides both in surface water and groundwater on the contrary hg concentration in surface water in salt marsh was 2 1 times larger during neap tides than that during spring tides further the hg concentrations in groundwater during spring tides were nearly zero zn was statistically comparable in salt marsh surface water spring tides 8 5 times of neap tides and mangrove groundwater spring tides 1 54 times of neap tides 3 3 flux estimations the direction and magnitude of estimated fluxes of dissolved heavy metal loid s and dom varied with the solute species plant types and tidal types across the swi however they were mainly controlled by the advective flow rather than the passive diffusion as shown in fig 4 solute fluxes through the convection flow were 10 10 000 times larger than the diffusion transport indicating that the concentration gradient driven diffusion transport was almost negligible in this study the directions of advective flow dominated flux were controlled by the surface water groundwater interactions which has been well reported in wang et al 2022 simply the groundwater discharge i e outflow and surface water infiltration i e inflow mainly occurred during falling and rising tides respectively the flux magnitude was co determined by the water exchange rate and concentration value in surface water when outflow inflow or groundwater when outflow inflow with respect to the time series of flux variations all dissolved heavy metal loid s and dom have similar trend of tidal changes that is the outflow and inflow peaked at low and high tides respectively due to the differences in sediment permeability and the slope of creek bank in two study sites mangrove had a larger water exchange rate and thus produced larger solute fluxes than in salt marsh fig 4 the hourly advective flow dominated fluxes of dissolved metal loid s and dom had different variation ranges 0 2 26 μg m 2h 1 for cr 0 5 4 μg m 2h 1 for cu 0 40 95 μg m 2h 1 for zn 0 2 44 μg m 2h 1 for as 0 173 7 μg m 2h 1 for ba 0 0 84 μg m 2h 1 for pb 0 0 19 μg m 2h 1 for hg 0 01 18 32 mg m 2h 1 for dom and 0 0 01 h 1 for cdom during the spring neap tidal cycles we conducted comparative analyses of water exchange rates and solute fluxes within different tidal types and plant types regarding the water exchange rate the average outflow rates 0 75 and 0 41 mm h 1 during neap and spring tides respectively were 3 75 and 2 0 times larger than average inflow rates in mangrove resulting in a net groundwater discharge during the whole observation period in contrast the salt marsh had 1 7 times larger inflow rates 0 26 mm h 1 on average than outflow rates during neap tides outflow was nearly equal to inflow during spring tides thus resulting in a net infiltration of surface water during the whole observation period the flux magnitudes and directions of different solutes varied greatly fig 5 for example the advective fluxes of ba 259 2 2308 μg m 2 d 1 and zn 14 7 387 4 μg m 2 d 1 were 10 100 times larger than other metal loid s 0 14 24 8 μg m 2 d 1 for cr 6 2 22 4 μg m 2 d 1 for cu 0 7 25 4 μg m 2 d 1 for as 0 1 6 0 μg m 2 d 1 for pb 0 1 7 μg m 2 d 1 for hg the flux patterns of dom 3 1 116 mg m 2 d 1 and cdom 0 0 1 d 1 were very consistent indicating that they were closely correlated 4 discussion 4 1 relationships between dissolved metal loid s and dom as shown in fig s1 the pearson correlations and dual hierarchical cluster analysis hca indicated the complex relationships among hydrochemical parameters dissolved metal loid s and dom characteristics and these relationships varied with water types and plant types the hca classified these variables into two groups clusters ⅰ and ⅱ according to their similarities or characteristics in different water types for example in marsh surface water the cluster ⅰ included tide salinity cr zn pb suva254 cdom cu dom as and ba tide significantly correlated with salinity cr zn suva254 cdom at p 0 01 and pb at p 0 05 fig s1a further salinity and ba were common indicators of the mixing degree between saline water and freshwater evans et al 2015 indicating the key role of tidal hydrology in cluster ⅰ the cluster ⅱ included ph do hg and e2 e3 which were likely controlled by the biochemical reactions in salt marsh groundwater clusters ⅰ and ⅱ included four tide salinity as and cu and eleven variables respectively fig s1b compared with surface water groundwater level did not correlate with other variables significantly in salt marsh indicating that the variables in groundwater were less influenced by seawater mixing but more influenced by biogeochemical reactions the similar regularities except the cluster groups also exited in the water body in mangrove the pca showed that the first principal component pc1 accounts for the largest proportion 33 5 of the total variance and showed significant positive loadings of tide salinity cr zn suva254 cdom and negative loading of hg and e2 e3 in the salt marsh fig s2a revealing the main role of tidal hydrology the second principal component pc2 only explained 13 4 of the cumulative variance manifesting positively correlated with pb and negatively with ph and do representing the key role of biogeochemical reactions in view of pc scores the sampling points of groundwater and surface water were obviously distinguished similar to the cluster analysis in mangrove the pc1 explains the greatest variance 23 3 and showed significant positive weightings with tide ph do as well as a strong inversely correlated with zn and ba fig s2b the pc2 was characterized by highly positive loadings in salinity cr pb and negative in as and suva254 similarly all salinity tide do ph as cu and suva254 were positively correlated with pc1 in surface water while other variables were negatively correlated with pc1 in groundwater suggesting that the main driving forces were different in groundwater and surface water in order to minimize the interference from variations in dom levels the metal loid affinity with dom was assessed by the metal loid to dom concentration ratios me dom and linked with the spectroscopic characteristics of the dom kikuchi et al 2017 we found more significant relationships among me dom salinity cdom and suva254 than individual metal loid s fig 6 and s1 this is because the dissolved metal loid s tend to bind dom with higher molecular weight aromatic structure or microbial derivative dom which can provide more binding sites than those dom with lower molecular weight e g kikuchi et al 2017 xu et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 in marsh and mangrove surface water tide salinity suva254 cdom and most me dom ratios belong to cluster ⅰ indicating the key role of tidal hydrology again however ph do dom hg dom and e2 e3 were classified into cluster ⅱ indicating the main control of biogeochemical reactions in particular the influence of biogeochemical reactions on hg may be more pronounced since hg often falls into the same cluster as ph and do in view of the pca the loading directions of me dom were more concentrated than that of individual metal loid s indicating that dom has a stronger binding effect on metal loid s in the salt marsh the pc1 accounted for the largest proportion 30 3 of the total variance and showed significant positive loading of tide salinity cr dom zn dom as dom suva254 cdom and negative loading of e2 e3 fig 7 a the pc 2 explained 15 8 of the cumulative variance manifesting positively correlated with ph and do and negatively with ba dom in contrast the pc1 explained the greatest of the variance 25 0 and showed significant positive weightings with tide do salinity cr dom as dom as well as a strong inversely correlated with dom in the mangrove fig 7b the pc2 was characterized by highly positive loadings in cr dom pb dom e2 e3 and negative loading with ph last the pc scores also revealed that the surface water and groundwater had different driving forces as visual dispersion shown in fig 7 in the salt marsh tide ph do dom cdom suva254 hg dom and cr dom positively correlated with pc2 in surface water but most of me dom zn dom pb dom as dom cu dom and ba dom negatively correlated with pc 2 indicating that pc 2 was the main factor to distinguish the changes of variables in marsh surface water and groundwater in contrast most of the variables in mangrove showed positive correlations with pc1 in surface water while dom e2 e3 and cdom showed negative correlations with pc1 in groundwater indicating a controlling role of pc1 on environmental variables both in surface water and groundwater 4 2 comparisons and vertical source sink patterns the value ranges of hydrochemical parameters including ph do salinity dom and dissolved metal loid s in this study whether it was in surface water or groundwater were similar to those found in other coastal wetlands e g salt marsh mangrove mudflat such as in india egypt and china table s3 furthermore our estimated groundwater derived advective fluxes of dissolved metal loid s also fell well within the wide range observed in coastal ecosystems including salt marsh mangrove estuaries and coastal bays table 2 however the advective fluxes varied by 10 1000 orders of magnitude at different sites indicating large differences in influencing factors exited at different sites and it was difficult to conduct a unified global flux assessment for dissolved metal loid s for example the average flux ranges of cu zn and pb calculated by trezzi et al 2016 on the western mediterranean sea using the approach of natural tracer mass balances were 13 16 and 9 5 times respectively lower than our estimations in salt marsh further the average flux ranges calculated by prakash et al 2021 on the coleroon river estuary using radon tracer mass balances were 3 7 2 8 and 6 3 times larger for cr cu and pb but 1 1 and 1 9 times lower for zn and ba respectively than our estimations in salt marsh in particular as the sandy beach in jiaozhou bay has a higher advective flow rate than other research sites the average metal loid fluxes were 10 1000 magnitude higher than other areas qu et al 2020 in addition our calculated diffusion fluxes were at least an order of magnitude lower than other sites table 1 for example the diffusion fluxes of zn in seabed of galveston bay estimated by warnken et al 2001 ranged from 117 to 214 5 μg m 2 day 1 which were nearly 15 120 times larger than our estimations in salt marsh and mangrove further the average diffusion flux ranges of cr cu and zn in pakong estuary estimated by cheevaporn et al 1995 were 110 77 and 3 3 times larger than our estimations in mangrove the large differences may be caused by the large diffusive distance 30 cm between the endmembers of overlying surface water and groundwater resulting in lower diffusion fluxes of all dissolved metal loid s the magnitudes and vertical directions of solute fluxes varied with different elements in temporal scales between neap and spring tides fig 5 for example the variation ranges of advective fluxes decreased by 1 2 folds and 4 7 folds for as but increased 2 1 folds and 1 4 folds for cu in salt marsh and in mangrove respectively from neap tides to spring tides the flux ranges of other elements also varied by different orders of magnitude depending on the differences in concentration and advective flow rates during neap and spring tides further there were also great spatial variabilities in solute fluxes with plant types fig 5 for example the salt marsh sediments acted as sources net groundwater efflux of cr and cu but sinks of zn as ba pb hg and dom during neap tides however the salt marsh sediments became sources of cu as ba dom and cdom during spring tides taking the neap and spring tides as a whole the salt marsh were the sinks of cr 2 13 μg m 2 d 1 zn 45 μg m 2 d 1 ba 10 μg m 2 d 1 pb 0 48 μg m 2 d 1 and hg 0 22 μg m 2 d 1 but the sources of cu 8 89 μg m 2 d 1 as 2 3 μg m 2 d 1 dom 1 0 mg m 2 d 1 and cdom 0 01 d 1 in contrast mangrove sediments have always been the sources of all dissolved metal loid s and dom both during neap and spring tides because groundwater efflux has always been greater than the surface water influx the average output flux during spring neap tidal cycles were 15 1 μg m 2 d 1 for cr 21 8 μg m 2 d 1 for cu 384 μg m 2 d 1 for zn 17 9 μg m 2 d 1 for as 1995 μg m 2 d 1 for ba 5 2 μg m 2 d 1 for pb 1 13 μg m 2 d 1 for hg 88 1 mg m 2 d 1 for dom and 0 08 d 1 for cdom respectively if we upscaled these calculations of metal loid and dom fluxes to the entire zhangjiang estuary areas including 1 42 km2 salt marsh and 0 59 km2 mangrove dong et al 2020 the salt marsh can vertically absorb 3 0 g cr 64 g zn 14 g ba 0 68 g pb and 0 32 g hg but discharge 12 7 g cu 3 2 g as and 1 43 kg dom per day in contrast the mangrove can vertically discharge 8 85 g cr 12 8 g cu 225 g zn 10 5 g as 1169 g ba 3 0 g pb 0 66 g hg and 51 6 kg dom per day respectively 4 3 environmental implications limitations and perspectives the salt marsh mangrove ecotone occurred along the land ocean interface under the influence of both fresh and seawater as schematically shown in fig 8 these ecosystems whether native or invasive can provide similar ecological functions and act as key hotspots exchanging significant amounts of organic matters dittmar et al 2006 webb et al 2019 and metals thanh nho et al 2020 in their sediments the difference in physiological characteristics and structures likely alter the hydrological and biogeochemical cycles kelleway et al 2017 huang et al 2022 which further determined the capacity to act as net sinks or sources of metal loid s in our study sites the vertical advective fluxes in the landward mangrove surpassed that in the seaward salt marsh mainly due to the steeper slope of creek bank resulting in a larger hydraulic gradient and relatively larger hydraulic conductivity wang et al 2022 further it was found that the sediments of native mangrove were the sources of all dissolved metal loid s which were continuously discharged from the sediments into the surface water through groundwater outflow during the spring neap tidal cycles fig 5 because the invaded salt marsh was located closer to the ocean than upper mangrove fig 1 the solutes discharged from the mangrove especially for cu and as may re enter the salt marsh through the surface water infiltration and eventually be deposited in the marsh sediments or be excreted into the ocean through the marginal bare mudflat in short the salt marsh mangrove ecotone may have more potential to alleviate the metal loid pollution in surface water than a separate flora through increasing pollutant storage capacity in sediments and changing plant soil interactions yando et al 2016 this study revealed the contrasting fluxes of dissolved metal loid s across the swi on the temporal scale of spring neap tides between the mangrove and salt marsh however sediment organic matter and metal loid s cycles may also vary with seasonality the magnitude or direction of advective fluxes likely change with vegetation condition and seasonal rainfall events steinmuller et al 2020 sullivan et al 2021 moreover we only focused on the vertical fluxes across swi the horizontal water flow across the salt marsh creek mangrove mudflat coastal water continuum in this studied area might play a more important role in transporting dissolved and suspended materials dittmar and lara 2001 which deserves to be studied in further work in addition the advective fluxes were the product of advective water flow rate and the concentration of the end member without considering the concentration change caused by the mutation of redox condition through the interface although this is the current common approach qu et al 2020 tamborski et al 2021 more precise methods need to be developed finer vertical profile sampling may avoid such errors but requires additional economic input in addition the bioturbation intensity at the sediment interface of different plant types may be different wang et al 2014 kristensen et al 2012 for example invertebrate fiddler crabs known as ecological engineers kristensen 2008 can create large preferential conduits that change the direction and magnitude of advective flow xiao et al 2019b and further likely influence the concentrations of dissolved metal loid s pan et al 2022 all these factors will lead to uncertainty in flux estimations and deviation of the coupling relationship between dissolved metal loid s and dom our combined study of geochemical processes in the salt marsh mangrove ecotone advanced our knowledge about how dissolved metal loid s and dom respond to the tidal hydrology salt marsh expansion seemed to increase the metal loid burials in sediments and alleviate the water pollution in nearby coastal waters however with the rise of sea level frederikse et al 2020 how the changed plant types nutrient level ding et al 2021 and hydrology condition kaal et al 2022 yu et al 2023 affect the metal binding behavior of dissolved organic matter is worthy of further investigations further how human activities such as the constructions of dam and aquaculture change the source sink pattern of dissolved metal loid s across the sediment water interface is also needed for future consideration this is because dam construction can block the underground hydraulic exchange between wetland interiors and inland and the boom in aquaculture directly releases some metal loid s into surface waters for example there are large scale aquaculture farms on both sides of this research site fig 1 but how the scale and location of aquaculture farms affect wetland water quality is worthy of further study and consideration by managers 5 conclusions this study improved our understanding of the influence mechanism of tidal hydrology on dom characteristics and their binding behaviors with dissolved metal loid s through the time series observations of surface water and groundwater in a subtropical mangrove wetland that is experiencing rapid encroachment of salt marsh the observations evidenced that the temporal variabilities of dissolved metal loid s and dom characteristics were well explained by tidal hydrology including the surface water infiltrations during the rising tides and groundwater discharge during the ebbing tides the advective flow rather the passive diffusion dominated the vertical transport of dissolved metal loid s through the sediment water interface and the vertical source sink pattern which varied with plant types and tidal types i e the spring and neap tidal cycles the mangrove sediments acted as a net source of all dissolved metal loid s and dom exported to the surface water while the salt marsh sediments acted as the net sinks of cr zn ba pb and hg and sources of cu as and dom the statistics revealed more significant correlations among hydrology dom characteristics especially for suva254 as a proxy of dom aromaticity and me dom ratios indicating a strong metal loid affinity with dom this study provided a first hand ecosystem scale information on metal loid dom relations in a representative salt marsh mangrove ecotone more recognition of metal loid dom interactions and their binding mechanisms should be resolved with more intensive monitoring on larger temporal scale and laboratory based molecular level analyses e g fan et al 2022 huang et al 2022 in particular the observed contrasting source sink pattern of dissolved metal loid s between salt marsh and mangrove provided broader insights into the potential ecological implication of salt marsh encroachment especially in the context of global climate change and sea level rising that are continuing to fluctuate the spatial distribution areas of two plant types credit authorship contribution statement kai

1787,coastal wetlands are considered as efficient barriers for pollutants such as dissolved metal loid s between land and sea however there remains a challenge in understanding how tidal hydrology regulates the source sink patterns of metal loid s across the sediment water interface especially in the salt marsh mangrove ecotone that commonly exists in subtropical coastlines in this study we conducted detailed time series observations of dissolved metal loid s cr cu zn ba pb hg and as and organic matter dom characteristics bulk concentrations aromaticity and molecular size in southeast china over a spring neap tidal cycle the results demonstrated that both dom and metal loid s fluctuated with tide levels and higher concentrations exited in groundwater than that in the surface water the concentrations of bulk dom and chromophoric dom both in surface water varied oppositely with tide levels suggesting the potential role of groundwater discharge at low tides dom aromaticity also had tidal time scale fluctuations but the molecular weight of dom was insensitive to tide changes the dispersion fluxes were one to four orders of magnitude lower than advective fluxes with the ranges of 0 14 24 8 μg m 2 d 1 for cr 6 2 22 4 μg m 2 d 1 for cu 14 7 387 4 μg m 2 d 1 for zn 0 7 25 4 μg m 2 d 1 for as 259 2 2308 μg m 2 d 1 for ba 0 1 6 0 μg m 2 d 1 for pb 0 1 7 μg m 2 d 1 for hg and 3 1 116 mg m 2 d 1 for dom respectively mangrove sediments tended to be the sources of dom and all dissolved metal loid s but the salt marsh was only the source of cu as and dom these results have implications on the geochemical cycling of dom and dissolved metal loid s in the salt marsh mangrove ecotone which has contrasting pattern of surface water groundwater exchange keywords blue carbon system tidal creek trace metals zhangjiang estuary advection diffusion model sediment water interface data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction coastal wetlands such as salt marsh and mangrove can bury massive organic carbon in sediments than they naturally release although they only occupy 5 of the global land area and 2 of the ocean area they store roughly 50

marsh was introduced in the late 1970 s to reduce coastal erosion but has spread southward by about 19 of latitude in the last two decades invading mangrove due to marsh s stronger reproduction capacity an et al 2007 zhang et al 2012 currently information is lacking on the potential impacts of marsh encroachment into native mangrove habitats on biogeochemical cycling feller et al 2017 kelleway et al 2017 salt marsh and mangrove can play a key role in buffering pollutants such as dissolved metals and metalloids hereafter metal loid s from the land to coastal water anjum et al 2014 rajaram et al 2020 due to the metal loid toxicities to organisms and human beings metal loid cycling has been recognized as a serious question during the last few decades jaishankar et al 2014 geronimo et al 2021 police et al 2021 recently li et al 2022 systematically investigated the heavy metal pollution of global coastal wetlands through analyzing 3 000 articles published over the past three decades they found that the heavy metal pollution of global coastal wetlands has gradually increased due to the rapid development of coastal human activities but most previous studies focused on metal distributions in sediments li et al 2022 in addition most of the studies were conducted in independent ecosystems rather than symbiotic plant systems li et al 2022 because different species in coastal wetlands often interact to form communities pennings and he 2021 furthermore few studies investigated the vertical transport of metal loid s across the sediment water interface hereafter swi through either advective flow sanders et al 2015 holloway et al 2016 or passive diffusion blasco et al 2000 warnken et al 2001 which not only depend on sediment characteristics kaly et al 1997 but also on tidal hydrology qu et al 2020 and plant types that control the wetland morphology shaffer and kandalepas 2016 dissolved organic matter dom in coastal wetlands can affect the environmental behaviors of dissolved metal loid s in aquatic environments e g webb et al 2019 zhang et al 2022 the dom usually contains various amounts of o containing functional groups e g carboxylic and phenolic groups and n s containing functional groups e g amide and thiol groups these groups can have strong affinities for dissolved metal loid s through a series of reactions such as ion exchange adsorption redox complexation and methylation to stabilize or release metal loid s polubesova and chefetz 2014 dom can also directly affect the water color in ion flocculation and deteriorate the water quality by combining with mineral ions herzsprung et al 2012 moreover the chromophoric dom cdom that readily absorbs solar ultraviolet uv and visible radiation blough et al 1993 can also affect water optics and generate reactive oxygen species that alter the migration and transformation of dissolved metal loid s mopper and kieber 2002 although dom and metal loid s can interact in water columns mcdonough et al 2020 the time series of observations on dom metal loid s interactions in the salt marsh mangrove ecotone were rarely reported thanh nho et al 2020 the salt marsh invading mangrove can influence creek bank slope kimball and eash loucks 2021 and further change the vertically advective flow and fluxes of dissolved nutrients wang et al 2022 thus we hypothesized that the spatiotemporal distributions of dom and dissolved metal loid s including chromium cr copper cu zinc zn arsenic as barium ba lead pb and mercury hg will greatly vary with plant types and tidal types in the marsh mangrove ecotone to test this hypothesis we carried out time series observations of dom and dissolved metal loid s in surface water and groundwater during a spring neap tidal cycle the field campaigns were conducted on the southeast china coastline where a subtropical mangrove wetland was invaded by salt marsh the specific objectives of this study were 1 to estimate contrasting fluxes of dissolved metal loid s and dom through the advective flow and passive diffusion across the swi 2 to explore the interplay among tidal hydrology dissolved metal loid s and dom characteristics and 3 to explore the potential implication of salt marsh invasion to the vertical source sink patterns of dissolved metal loid s 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the study site the study site is located in the natural mangrove reserve 117 24 117 30 e 23 53 23 56 n in the zhangjiang estuary fujian china fig 1 the zhangjiang estuary links the semi enclosed dongshan bay and surface water flows into the taiwan strait the mangrove reserve has an area of 2 6 km2 which is comprised of three primary areas an upper area dominated by avicennia marina kandelia obovata and aegiceras corniculatum mangrove species a middle area occupied by the invasive spartina alterniflora and a lower area with bare mudflat environment wu et al 2021 the invasive area has increased to 1 4 km2 over the last 30 years dong et al 2020 the mangrove reserve belongs to a monsoon climate pattern exhibiting annual precipitation of 1714 5 mm and annual temperature of 21 2 c respectively http www chinaflux org tides were semidiurnal with a tidal range of 0 43 to 4 67 m and a mean tidal range of 2 32 m zhang et al 2013 2 2 monitoring and sampling campaigns field campaigns were conducted along a winding tidal creek fig 1 the field approaches consisted of 1 time series observations of groundwater level and tidal level around the creek bank to estimate advective flow rate across the swi and 2 sampling surface water and groundwater to characterize the bulk concentrations and characteristics of dom and dissolved metal loid s two field campaigns occurred on two occasions including one day during neap tides on 10th october 2020 and another day during spring tides on 20th october 2020 each campaign has a total of 25 to 28 hourly observations and samplings the approach for quantifying the advective flow rates relied on the generalized darcy s law and hydraulic data from two so called paired wells installed along the creek banks of the salt marsh and mangrove wang et al 2022 surface waters 50 cm below the water air interface were collected per hour using a pre decontaminated niskin hydrophore on a boat anchored in the middle location of the tidal creek in addition groundwater was collected hourly from self designed groundwater sampling wells at depths of 25 50 cm using a peristaltic pump wang et al 2022 while our groundwater sampling approach cannot resolve fine scale vertical distributions required to interpret metal loid s geochemistry this approach allows for surrounding sediment porewater to fill up the sampling well to represent an integrated value of the groundwater endmember exchanging with surface waters by either advective flow and or passive diffusion on tidal time scales a total of 160 water samples were collected during two sampling periods including 105 surface water samples and 55 groundwater samples all water samples were filtered with a whatman gf f 0 7 μm glass membrane pre combusted at 450 for 4 5 h and the in situ salinity dissolved oxygen do and ph values were measured using a portable meter multi 3430 germany water samples were divided into two kinds of washed bottles for dom the water samples were stored in a 50 ml brown glass bottle acidified using concentrated suprapurr hcl for dissolved metal loid s the water samples were immediately transferred into acid precleaned polypropylene bottles 50 ml and then acidified to ph 2 using concentrated suprapurr hno3 for sample preservation strady et al 2009 all samples were sent to the laboratory at a low temperature 4 before further processing 2 3 laboratory analysis the bulk doc concentration as the primary proxy of dom was analyzed using the total organic carbon analyzer shimadzu japan we measured the absorbance of the samples using an ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer with a 1 cm quartz cuvette and milli q water as reference the specific ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm suva254 was used to indicate dom aromaticity and calculated by dividing the absorbance at 254 nm a254 by the doc concentration weishaar et al 2003 we calculated the ratio of the absorbance at 254 nm to that at 365 nm as the e2 e3 which usually has a negative correlation with the molecular weight of dom wang et al 2018 the a350 was selected as a proxy of cdom concentration and was calculated as 2 303 a350 l where a350 and l were the measured optical density at 350 nm and cuvette length respectively spencer et al 2013 the concentrations of dissolved metals cr cu zn ba pb and hg and metalloid as were determined using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms thermo fisher scientific usa each sample was detected by three times with the relative standard deviation of the replicates being 10 blanks milli q water suffering the same preparation procedure were set in every ten samples during the analysis the recoveries of dissolved metal loid s ranged from 80 to 100 and the detection limits had a range of 0 01 0 05 μg l depending on the metal loid species 2 4 advection diffusion model the advection diffusion model was used to calculate the tidal exchange of dom and dissolved metal loid s across the swi by considering advective flow and passive diffusion the advective flux fadv could be determined by examining the sediment saturated hydraulic conductivity hydraulic gradient between two paired wells and solute concentrations in surface water or groundwater 1 f adv k v j c i where kv is the vertical hydraulic conductivity of saturated sediments l t 1 obtained from the in situ falling head method wang et al 2014 j is the hydraulic gradient between two paired wells if j 0 the groundwater flows vertically upward through the sediments otherwise j 0 the seawater infiltrates the sediments more details about the calculations of j were given in wang et al 2022 thus the hourly advective flow is the product of kv and hourly j ci is the hourly concentration of ith solute in groundwater j 0 or surface water j 0 the passive diffusion flux fdiff between sediment groundwater and the overlying water was estimated based on fick s law 2 f diff φ 0 d s c i z i where φ 0 was the porosity that was expressed as the water volume fraction in the wet sediment by identifying the weight difference between wet sediment samples before and after drying at 60 ds cm2d 1 was the diffusion coefficient of dissolved solutes c i z i was the concentration gradient between groundwater and the overlying surface water ds was corrected for porosity φ 0 from the molecular diffusion coefficient d0 of a free solute table s1 ullman and sandstrom 1987 put forward the following empirical correlation of ds with φ 0 3 d s φ 0 d 0 φ 0 0 7 φ 2 2 d 0 φ 0 0 7 where d0 is the molecular diffusion coefficient for the targeted element table s1 according to the above calculations negative advective and diffusive fluxes reflect sediment uptake processes i e downward fluxes in contrast positive fluxes indicate benthic recycling i e outward fluxes from groundwater to surface waters 2 5 statistics the differences in hydrochemical parameters tide level ph do and salinity concentrations of dissolved metal loid s cr cu zn ba pb hg and as and dom characteristic parameters doc concentration a350 suva254 and e2 e3 among water types surface water and groundwater plant types salt marsh and mangrove and tidal types spring and neap tides were analyzed by analysis of variance anova and tukey s honestly significant difference test after logarithmic transformation of the non normal data the pearson correlation analysis was also applied to explore the mutual relations among the above parameters as the kaiser meyer olkin and bartlett tests were satisfied principal component analysis pca was applied for reducing the dimensions of variables in surface water and groundwater the loading and score of each sample were obtained the significance level was set at p 0 05 for all statistical analyses the above statistical analyses were performed using spss software version 22 0 3 results 3 1 time series of hydrochemical parameters and dom characteristics there were marked temporal variations for all hydrochemical parameters including salinity 11 6 24 7 psu do 0 4 8 6 mg l and ph 6 6 10 9 during the time series of observations at all sites fig 2 no rainfall was recorded prior to or during the observation period trends in salinity do and ph values followed tidal cycles that is they reached their peak and lowest values at high and low tides respectively the high salinity observed at high tides demonstrated that these systems behave as normal tidal creeks with tidally varying salinity in surface water xiao et al 2019a in addition the salinity had a similar variable range between surface water and groundwater at all sites and both were significantly larger during spring tides than that during neap tides table s2 however the do and ph have significant comparability only in surface water in different tidal types p 0 05 the values of do and ph in groundwater were also significantly lower than that in surface water p 0 05 indicating that groundwater was a low oxygen and more acidic water environment compared with surface water the temporal variation trends of dom concentration 2 0 16 1 mg l in surface water and 2 3 21 4 mg l in groundwater were the opposite with salinity i e slightly larger at low tides than at high tides both in surface water and groundwater this suggested that the groundwater derived dom and or external dom sources from the upstream freshwater inputs contributed to the increase of surface water dom concentration at low tides the cdom showed a similar trend to dom indicating that cdom can absorb more solar ultraviolet and visible radiation at low tides the suva254 indicating dom aromaticity showed a similar trend to dom and cdom during neap tides but became the opposite during spring tides the e2 e3 which is usually negatively correlated with the dom molecular weight did not show an obvious pattern of regular tidal variations but showed a jagged fluctuation trend with tide level indicating that the dom molecular weight was driven by other factors with shorter time scales finally most of the above dom characteristics showed that the variability ranges were significantly higher during spring tides than during neap tides table 1 indicating the major control of tidal hydrology 3 2 time series of dissolved metal loid s characteristics in terms of temporal changes the concentrations of dissolved metal loid s varied with tidal types water types and plant types fig 3 and table 2 unlike physico chemical parameters and dom characteristics tidal variations of dissolved metal loid s were not visually obvious for example cr concentration 0 04 5 8 μg l 1 in mangrove surface water changed periodically with tidal levels in the first tidal cycle but the regularity was not sustained in the second tidal cycle cu concentration 0 17 16 3 μg l 1 in mangrove surface water changed periodically with tidal levels throughout only the neap tides ba concentration 49 358 3 μg l 1 negatively correlated with tidal level during most of the observation period likely indicating that ba was released from sediments into groundwater and then discharged into tidal creek at low tides pb concentration 0 3 1 μg l 1 has no obvious regularity but the concentrations of some samples both in surface water and groundwater were less than the detection limit of equipment during neap tides zn 3 38 346 0 μg l 1 as 0 55 2 8 μg l 1 and hg 0 0 85 μg l 1 concentrations did not change significantly with tidal levels from a statistical point of view between neap tides and spring tides there was no uniform regularities between the average concentration of dissolved metal loid s and water type or plant type table 1 for example most of cr and as concentrations were significantly lower during neap than those during spring tides p 0 05 cu in salt marsh p 0 05 and ba in mangrove p 0 05 during neap tides were significantly lower than those during spring tides both in surface water and groundwater on the contrary hg concentration in surface water in salt marsh was 2 1 times larger during neap tides than that during spring tides further the hg concentrations in groundwater during spring tides were nearly zero zn was statistically comparable in salt marsh surface water spring tides 8 5 times of neap tides and mangrove groundwater spring tides 1 54 times of neap tides 3 3 flux estimations the direction and magnitude of estimated fluxes of dissolved heavy metal loid s and dom varied with the solute species plant types and tidal types across the swi however they were mainly controlled by the advective flow rather than the passive diffusion as shown in fig 4 solute fluxes through the convection flow were 10 10 000 times larger than the diffusion transport indicating that the concentration gradient driven diffusion transport was almost negligible in this study the directions of advective flow dominated flux were controlled by the surface water groundwater interactions which has been well reported in wang et al 2022 simply the groundwater discharge i e outflow and surface water infiltration i e inflow mainly occurred during falling and rising tides respectively the flux magnitude was co determined by the water exchange rate and concentration value in surface water when outflow inflow or groundwater when outflow inflow with respect to the time series of flux variations all dissolved heavy metal loid s and dom have similar trend of tidal changes that is the outflow and inflow peaked at low and high tides respectively due to the differences in sediment permeability and the slope of creek bank in two study sites mangrove had a larger water exchange rate and thus produced larger solute fluxes than in salt marsh fig 4 the hourly advective flow dominated fluxes of dissolved metal loid s and dom had different variation ranges 0 2 26 μg m 2h 1 for cr 0 5 4 μg m 2h 1 for cu 0 40 95 μg m 2h 1 for zn 0 2 44 μg m 2h 1 for as 0 173 7 μg m 2h 1 for ba 0 0 84 μg m 2h 1 for pb 0 0 19 μg m 2h 1 for hg 0 01 18 32 mg m 2h 1 for dom and 0 0 01 h 1 for cdom during the spring neap tidal cycles we conducted comparative analyses of water exchange rates and solute fluxes within different tidal types and plant types regarding the water exchange rate the average outflow rates 0 75 and 0 41 mm h 1 during neap and spring tides respectively were 3 75 and 2 0 times larger than average inflow rates in mangrove resulting in a net groundwater discharge during the whole observation period in contrast the salt marsh had 1 7 times larger inflow rates 0 26 mm h 1 on average than outflow rates during neap tides outflow was nearly equal to inflow during spring tides thus resulting in a net infiltration of surface water during the whole observation period the flux magnitudes and directions of different solutes varied greatly fig 5 for example the advective fluxes of ba 259 2 2308 μg m 2 d 1 and zn 14 7 387 4 μg m 2 d 1 were 10 100 times larger than other metal loid s 0 14 24 8 μg m 2 d 1 for cr 6 2 22 4 μg m 2 d 1 for cu 0 7 25 4 μg m 2 d 1 for as 0 1 6 0 μg m 2 d 1 for pb 0 1 7 μg m 2 d 1 for hg the flux patterns of dom 3 1 116 mg m 2 d 1 and cdom 0 0 1 d 1 were very consistent indicating that they were closely correlated 4 discussion 4 1 relationships between dissolved metal loid s and dom as shown in fig s1 the pearson correlations and dual hierarchical cluster analysis hca indicated the complex relationships among hydrochemical parameters dissolved metal loid s and dom characteristics and these relationships varied with water types and plant types the hca classified these variables into two groups clusters ⅰ and ⅱ according to their similarities or characteristics in different water types for example in marsh surface water the cluster ⅰ included tide salinity cr zn pb suva254 cdom cu dom as and ba tide significantly correlated with salinity cr zn suva254 cdom at p 0 01 and pb at p 0 05 fig s1a further salinity and ba were common indicators of the mixing degree between saline water and freshwater evans et al 2015 indicating the key role of tidal hydrology in cluster ⅰ the cluster ⅱ included ph do hg and e2 e3 which were likely controlled by the biochemical reactions in salt marsh groundwater clusters ⅰ and ⅱ included four tide salinity as and cu and eleven variables respectively fig s1b compared with surface water groundwater level did not correlate with other variables significantly in salt marsh indicating that the variables in groundwater were less influenced by seawater mixing but more influenced by biogeochemical reactions the similar regularities except the cluster groups also exited in the water body in mangrove the pca showed that the first principal component pc1 accounts for the largest proportion 33 5 of the total variance and showed significant positive loadings of tide salinity cr zn suva254 cdom and negative loading of hg and e2 e3 in the salt marsh fig s2a revealing the main role of tidal hydrology the second principal component pc2 only explained 13 4 of the cumulative variance manifesting positively correlated with pb and negatively with ph and do representing the key role of biogeochemical reactions in view of pc scores the sampling points of groundwater and surface water were obviously distinguished similar to the cluster analysis in mangrove the pc1 explains the greatest variance 23 3 and showed significant positive weightings with tide ph do as well as a strong inversely correlated with zn and ba fig s2b the pc2 was characterized by highly positive loadings in salinity cr pb and negative in as and suva254 similarly all salinity tide do ph as cu and suva254 were positively correlated with pc1 in surface water while other variables were negatively correlated with pc1 in groundwater suggesting that the main driving forces were different in groundwater and surface water in order to minimize the interference from variations in dom levels the metal loid affinity with dom was assessed by the metal loid to dom concentration ratios me dom and linked with the spectroscopic characteristics of the dom kikuchi et al 2017 we found more significant relationships among me dom salinity cdom and suva254 than individual metal loid s fig 6 and s1 this is because the dissolved metal loid s tend to bind dom with higher molecular weight aromatic structure or microbial derivative dom which can provide more binding sites than those dom with lower molecular weight e g kikuchi et al 2017 xu et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 in marsh and mangrove surface water tide salinity suva254 cdom and most me dom ratios belong to cluster ⅰ indicating the key role of tidal hydrology again however ph do dom hg dom and e2 e3 were classified into cluster ⅱ indicating the main control of biogeochemical reactions in particular the influence of biogeochemical reactions on hg may be more pronounced since hg often falls into the same cluster as ph and do in view of the pca the loading directions of me dom were more concentrated than that of individual metal loid s indicating that dom has a stronger binding effect on metal loid s in the salt marsh the pc1 accounted for the largest proportion 30 3 of the total variance and showed significant positive loading of tide salinity cr dom zn dom as dom suva254 cdom and negative loading of e2 e3 fig 7 a the pc 2 explained 15 8 of the cumulative variance manifesting positively correlated with ph and do and negatively with ba dom in contrast the pc1 explained the greatest of the variance 25 0 and showed significant positive weightings with tide do salinity cr dom as dom as well as a strong inversely correlated with dom in the mangrove fig 7b the pc2 was characterized by highly positive loadings in cr dom pb dom e2 e3 and negative loading with ph last the pc scores also revealed that the surface water and groundwater had different driving forces as visual dispersion shown in fig 7 in the salt marsh tide ph do dom cdom suva254 hg dom and cr dom positively correlated with pc2 in surface water but most of me dom zn dom pb dom as dom cu dom and ba dom negatively correlated with pc 2 indicating that pc 2 was the main factor to distinguish the changes of variables in marsh surface water and groundwater in contrast most of the variables in mangrove showed positive correlations with pc1 in surface water while dom e2 e3 and cdom showed negative correlations with pc1 in groundwater indicating a controlling role of pc1 on environmental variables both in surface water and groundwater 4 2 comparisons and vertical source sink patterns the value ranges of hydrochemical parameters including ph do salinity dom and dissolved metal loid s in this study whether it was in surface water or groundwater were similar to those found in other coastal wetlands e g salt marsh mangrove mudflat such as in india egypt and china table s3 furthermore our estimated groundwater derived advective fluxes of dissolved metal loid s also fell well within the wide range observed in coastal ecosystems including salt marsh mangrove estuaries and coastal bays table 2 however the advective fluxes varied by 10 1000 orders of magnitude at different sites indicating large differences in influencing factors exited at different sites and it was difficult to conduct a unified global flux assessment for dissolved metal loid s for example the average flux ranges of cu zn and pb calculated by trezzi et al 2016 on the western mediterranean sea using the approach of natural tracer mass balances were 13 16 and 9 5 times respectively lower than our estimations in salt marsh further the average flux ranges calculated by prakash et al 2021 on the coleroon river estuary using radon tracer mass balances were 3 7 2 8 and 6 3 times larger for cr cu and pb but 1 1 and 1 9 times lower for zn and ba respectively than our estimations in salt marsh in particular as the sandy beach in jiaozhou bay has a higher advective flow rate than other research sites the average metal loid fluxes were 10 1000 magnitude higher than other areas qu et al 2020 in addition our calculated diffusion fluxes were at least an order of magnitude lower than other sites table 1 for example the diffusion fluxes of zn in seabed of galveston bay estimated by warnken et al 2001 ranged from 117 to 214 5 μg m 2 day 1 which were nearly 15 120 times larger than our estimations in salt marsh and mangrove further the average diffusion flux ranges of cr cu and zn in pakong estuary estimated by cheevaporn et al 1995 were 110 77 and 3 3 times larger than our estimations in mangrove the large differences may be caused by the large diffusive distance 30 cm between the endmembers of overlying surface water and groundwater resulting in lower diffusion fluxes of all dissolved metal loid s the magnitudes and vertical directions of solute fluxes varied with different elements in temporal scales between neap and spring tides fig 5 for example the variation ranges of advective fluxes decreased by 1 2 folds and 4 7 folds for as but increased 2 1 folds and 1 4 folds for cu in salt marsh and in mangrove respectively from neap tides to spring tides the flux ranges of other elements also varied by different orders of magnitude depending on the differences in concentration and advective flow rates during neap and spring tides further there were also great spatial variabilities in solute fluxes with plant types fig 5 for example the salt marsh sediments acted as sources net groundwater efflux of cr and cu but sinks of zn as ba pb hg and dom during neap tides however the salt marsh sediments became sources of cu as ba dom and cdom during spring tides taking the neap and spring tides as a whole the salt marsh were the sinks of cr 2 13 μg m 2 d 1 zn 45 μg m 2 d 1 ba 10 μg m 2 d 1 pb 0 48 μg m 2 d 1 and hg 0 22 μg m 2 d 1 but the sources of cu 8 89 μg m 2 d 1 as 2 3 μg m 2 d 1 dom 1 0 mg m 2 d 1 and cdom 0 01 d 1 in contrast mangrove sediments have always been the sources of all dissolved metal loid s and dom both during neap and spring tides because groundwater efflux has always been greater than the surface water influx the average output flux during spring neap tidal cycles were 15 1 μg m 2 d 1 for cr 21 8 μg m 2 d 1 for cu 384 μg m 2 d 1 for zn 17 9 μg m 2 d 1 for as 1995 μg m 2 d 1 for ba 5 2 μg m 2 d 1 for pb 1 13 μg m 2 d 1 for hg 88 1 mg m 2 d 1 for dom and 0 08 d 1 for cdom respectively if we upscaled these calculations of metal loid and dom fluxes to the entire zhangjiang estuary areas including 1 42 km2 salt marsh and 0 59 km2 mangrove dong et al 2020 the salt marsh can vertically absorb 3 0 g cr 64 g zn 14 g ba 0 68 g pb and 0 32 g hg but discharge 12 7 g cu 3 2 g as and 1 43 kg dom per day in contrast the mangrove can vertically discharge 8 85 g cr 12 8 g cu 225 g zn 10 5 g as 1169 g ba 3 0 g pb 0 66 g hg and 51 6 kg dom per day respectively 4 3 environmental implications limitations and perspectives the salt marsh mangrove ecotone occurred along the land ocean interface under the influence of both fresh and seawater as schematically shown in fig 8 these ecosystems whether native or invasive can provide similar ecological functions and act as key hotspots exchanging significant amounts of organic matters dittmar et al 2006 webb et al 2019 and metals thanh nho et al 2020 in their sediments the difference in physiological characteristics and structures likely alter the hydrological and biogeochemical cycles kelleway et al 2017 huang et al 2022 which further determined the capacity to act as net sinks or sources of metal loid s in our study sites the vertical advective fluxes in the landward mangrove surpassed that in the seaward salt marsh mainly due to the steeper slope of creek bank resulting in a larger hydraulic gradient and relatively larger hydraulic conductivity wang et al 2022 further it was found that the sediments of native mangrove were the sources of all dissolved metal loid s which were continuously discharged from the sediments into the surface water through groundwater outflow during the spring neap tidal cycles fig 5 because the invaded salt marsh was located closer to the ocean than upper mangrove fig 1 the solutes discharged from the mangrove especially for cu and as may re enter the salt marsh through the surface water infiltration and eventually be deposited in the marsh sediments or be excreted into the ocean through the marginal bare mudflat in short the salt marsh mangrove ecotone may have more potential to alleviate the metal loid pollution in surface water than a separate flora through increasing pollutant storage capacity in sediments and changing plant soil interactions yando et al 2016 this study revealed the contrasting fluxes of dissolved metal loid s across the swi on the temporal scale of spring neap tides between the mangrove and salt marsh however sediment organic matter and metal loid s cycles may also vary with seasonality the magnitude or direction of advective fluxes likely change with vegetation condition and seasonal rainfall events steinmuller et al 2020 sullivan et al 2021 moreover we only focused on the vertical fluxes across swi the horizontal water flow across the salt marsh creek mangrove mudflat coastal water continuum in this studied area might play a more important role in transporting dissolved and suspended materials dittmar and lara 2001 which deserves to be studied in further work in addition the advective fluxes were the product of advective water flow rate and the concentration of the end member without considering the concentration change caused by the mutation of redox condition through the interface although this is the current common approach qu et al 2020 tamborski et al 2021 more precise methods need to be developed finer vertical profile sampling may avoid such errors but requires additional economic input in addition the bioturbation intensity at the sediment interface of different plant types may be different wang et al 2014 kristensen et al 2012 for example invertebrate fiddler crabs known as ecological engineers kristensen 2008 can create large preferential conduits that change the direction and magnitude of advective flow xiao et al 2019b and further likely influence the concentrations of dissolved metal loid s pan et al 2022 all these factors will lead to uncertainty in flux estimations and deviation of the coupling relationship between dissolved metal loid s and dom our combined study of geochemical processes in the salt marsh mangrove ecotone advanced our knowledge about how dissolved metal loid s and dom respond to the tidal hydrology salt marsh expansion seemed to increase the metal loid burials in sediments and alleviate the water pollution in nearby coastal waters however with the rise of sea level frederikse et al 2020 how the changed plant types nutrient level ding et al 2021 and hydrology condition kaal et al 2022 yu et al 2023 affect the metal binding behavior of dissolved organic matter is worthy of further investigations further how human activities such as the constructions of dam and aquaculture change the source sink pattern of dissolved metal loid s across the sediment water interface is also needed for future consideration this is because dam construction can block the underground hydraulic exchange between wetland interiors and inland and the boom in aquaculture directly releases some metal loid s into surface waters for example there are large scale aquaculture farms on both sides of this research site fig 1 but how the scale and location of aquaculture farms affect wetland water quality is worthy of further study and consideration by managers 5 conclusions this study improved our understanding of the influence mechanism of tidal hydrology on dom characteristics and their binding behaviors with dissolved metal loid s through the time series observations of surface water and groundwater in a subtropical mangrove wetland that is experiencing rapid encroachment of salt marsh the observations evidenced that the temporal variabilities of dissolved metal loid s and dom characteristics were well explained by tidal hydrology including the surface water infiltrations during the rising tides and groundwater discharge during the ebbing tides the advective flow rather the passive diffusion dominated the vertical transport of dissolved metal loid s through the sediment water interface and the vertical source sink pattern which varied with plant types and tidal types i e the spring and neap tidal cycles the mangrove sediments acted as a net source of all dissolved metal loid s and dom exported to the surface water while the salt marsh sediments acted as the net sinks of cr zn ba pb and hg and sources of cu as and dom the statistics revealed more significant correlations among hydrology dom characteristics especially for suva254 as a proxy of dom aromaticity and me dom ratios indicating a strong metal loid affinity with dom this study provided a first hand ecosystem scale information on metal loid dom relations in a representative salt marsh mangrove ecotone more recognition of metal loid dom interactions and their binding mechanisms should be resolved with more intensive monitoring on larger temporal scale and laboratory based molecular level analyses e g fan et al 2022 huang et al 2022 in particular the observed contrasting source sink pattern of dissolved metal loid s between salt marsh and mangrove provided broader insights into the potential ecological implication of salt marsh encroachment especially in the context of global climate change and sea level rising that are continuing to fluctuate the spatial distribution areas of two plant types credit authorship contribution statement kai

1788,deltaic channels as the essential part in system of river deltas where river and ocean connect are influenced profoundly on its deposition and erosion processes by changes of riverine sediment due to human activities from catchment to mouth of large rivers and sea level rise worldwide here based on a series of hydrological sedimentary and morphological records in the main outer channel south passage sp of the river tide dominant changjiang yangtze delta cjd for more than half a century regional deposition erosion process and the implication mechanism were examined the results showed that fluvial sediment supply declined by over 70 stepwise during the past decades and local suspended sediment concentration in the sp reduced by half within recent years correspondingly three distinct stages of morphodynamic process came out one after another which were phases of rapid deposition 1959 1979 moderate deposition 1979 1997 and dramatic erosion 1997 2021 respectively channel and shoal had asynchronous performance during this deposition erosion transition especially after 1979 when channel entered a rapid erosion period earlier after a stable volume period while shoal suffered slow erosion after high speed deposition moreover the current erosion phase was furtherly explained as two main modes by the empirical orthogonal function analysis accounting for 61 and 14 respectively the dominant mode describes the continuous scouring in channel contributed by transfer in riverine sediment regime consisting of the reducing upstream sediment local increasing flow diversion dredging activities and sea level rise the second mode suggests decadal shift from deposition to slight erosion of shoal zones which was also adjusted to episodic events and local engineering projects like shoal embankment and reclamation it s predictable that the sp would constantly suffer long term erosion under riverine sediment reduction sea level rise and artificial waterway regulation together with aggradation of the fringing shoals by reclamation this highlights channels in the river deltas are faced with the erosion risk caused by anthropogenic activities which calls for compelling attention keywords deposition and erosion anthropogenic activities water and sediment transfer morphodynamic process south passage changjiang delta data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction river deltas provide significant habitats for organism which accommodate more than 300 million people in the world edmonds et al 2020 channels distributed over river deltas play important roles in coastal areas providing unique ecological habitat and significant navigation value for littoral economic and commercial development giosan et al 2014 leuven et al 2019 however the worldwide deltaic channels of most fluvial tidal deltas were in drastic changes attributed to transfer in the riverine estuarine sediment supply and transport caused by human activities syvitski et al 2005 nienhuis et al 2020 it s urgent to disentangle the deposition and erosion process of deltaic channels in response to the sediment transfer induced by intensive anthropogenic perturbation with which the exact mechanism still under debate syvitski et al 2009 nienhuis et al 2020 fluvial sediment exported to deltas manifests as two opposite trends driven by anthropogenic activities which are deforestation induced increases and reservoir or dam induced reductions syvitski et al 2005 nienhuis et al 2020 threatening the settlements of coastal people the decline of riverine sediment compounded with sea level rise is particularly concerned in many river deltas e g syvitski et al 2009 giosan et al 2014 schuerch et al 2018 serving as the conveyor and carrier of the material deltaic channels could be susceptible to the far filed sediment reduction such as in mekong delta and danube delta giosan et al 2013 anthony et al 2015 which increases the risk of coastal erosion a typical example is transition in water sediment regime of the yellow river delta in china where riparian land dilated and main channel narrowed for numerous sediment supply before regulation wang et al 2006 and subsequently the deltaic channel converted into erosion ji et al 2022 it s also proclaimed that the mouth channel length is more related to the cumulative riverine sediment rather than the changing sediment size shi et al 2019 though there are some rivers whose upstream sediment supply is affected by human activities e g liu et al 2014 anthony et al 2015 large deltas worldwide are lean to cope badly with sea level rise in the context of human induced sediment starvation syvitski et al 2009 yang et al 2011 nienhuis et al 2020 cox et al 2021 deltaic channels are artificially deepened by dredging strategy and sand excavation in sake of service for highly populated settlement and rapid urbanization anthony et al 2014 ralston et al 2019 channel deepening poses immediate effect to the morphodynamics which even overpasses that is brought by the reducing sediment at some extent such as the substantial incision after large scale sand excavation in the pearl river delta and limited impact when prohibition liu et al 2019 in the upper hudson estuary of u s ralston et al 2019 pointed out that dredging caused reduction of friction and sharp switch from tide decaying landward to tidal amplifying additionally with farther propagation of storm and lowered flooding which would strengthen the hydrodynamics to keep processive scouring however morphological changes caused by artificial channel deepening are not so exact for the reason of that the transport of sediment transport up estuary could be enhanced due to increased salinity driven circulation found by van maren et al 2015 in the ems estuary of netherland wu et al 2020 also found channel infilling after dredging project in the waterway of shenzhen river china cox et al 2022 furtherly noted that channel deepening could become ineffective under the sea level rise conditions due to sediment entrained landward by reinforced flood dominant tides even so the dredging and sand mining spawning macroscopic erosion are responsible for drown and risk to flooding defense in coastal zones liu et al 2019 cox et al 2022 in other words in spite of the benefit to navigation channel dredging could annoy morphologic stability and ecologic sustainability of the estuary hard engineering constructed in estuaries for various needs including ecological restoration storm defense land expansion and navigation stabilization rigorously disrupts the sediment transport and dynamic morphological equilibrium ceia et al 2010 elliott et al 2016 hoitink et al 2017 huguet et al 2018 in the danube estuary although human relevant reduction of sediment and erosion was aggravated hard engineering protection slowed down the coastal retreat and kept compete with the acceleration of the sea level rise giosan et al 2013 however it s found that embankments could probably lead to continuously severe scouring at the channel bed exerting potential risk for a longer period hoitink et al 2017 channel diversion with guide levees could also trigger sediment transfer along estuary making deposition erosion transition spatially and temporally such as the lowermost mississippi and atchafalaya system in america allison et al 2012 another type of engineering in estuary is reclamation which was investigated to make sense on the tidal amplification and bring risk of bank erosion pluvial flooding and navigation difficulty in granges brahmaputra delta van maren et al 2023 but bain et al 2019 s regional research suggested that embankment construction had immediate effect of driving a regional decline in tidal prism and discharge in the shibsa channel of the south ganges brahmaputra delta with the opposite shoaling effect to the channel basin volume therefore reclamation could bring distinct influence to the distributary channels of river delta especially in the complicated ambient of sediment starvation and sea level rise the outer channels i e the four distributary mouths north branch north channel north passage and south passage in changjiang river delta are in different evolutionary states in the context of sediment alteration dai 2021 on account of the minimal fluvial discharge and enhanced flood tide current the north branch was announced to be filled up during nearly half a century dai et al 2016 in the north channel erosion was observed along the inner channel for decline in riverine sediment especially since sediment retention by the three gorges dam in 2003 while accretion and narrowing were found in the lower channel which could be explained by tidal pumping mei et al 2018 as for the north passage the most regulated by artificial jetties and groins in the delta over the past decades peripheral groin fields silted up and channel was deepened by regular dredging jiang et al 2012 dai 2021 further adjacent to the channels the changjiang submerged delta could face with recession under human regulations and climate changes within recent decades in response to the sediment reduction caused by upstream dam construction e g yang et al 2017 dai et al 2018 while north passage is already one of the important deepwater waterways the south passage sp is a major water sediment discharge channel of the changjiang delta with the deposition erosion regime directly influenced by upstream sediment transfer simultaneously along both sides of the sp lie the broadest land derived tidal flat nanhui shoal and the largest uninhabited land jiuduan shoal of the delta additionally the sp is also the outlet closest to the population center whose evolution affects maritime transportation the development and safety of the littoral areas and the wetland ecosystem hence as the essential access of sediment transport with the center of the megacity shanghai on its south the sp plays a crucial role in the deltaic system dai 2021 within the recent decades in addition to the upstream sediment transfer the sp may be also influenced by a succession of artificial engineering projects including land reclamation diversion regulation guided jetties and dredging projects which could prompt the deposition erosion process into a rather complicated issue but with little specific exploration hence data of long term high resolution bathymetric surveys riverine water sediment records over half a century multi temporal landsat images in recent two decades and measured hydrological data of sp were processed here aiming to 1 elaborate the erosion and deposition process of the sp over the period 1959 2021 2 unveil the morphodynamic evolution pattern of this deltaic channel and 3 ascertain the major factors exerted on the erosion deposition process of the sp 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area changjiang river estuary 640 km inland from its tidal reaching limit datong anhui province nourishes one of the largest deltas in china chen et al 1999 fig 1 covering an area of about 358 000 km2 accommodating more than 220 million people and generating over 20 of gdp in china changjiang delta is one of the core regions of socio economic development four outer channels keep the land sea interaction in this deltaic system dai 2021 the sp is the southernmost waterway of the changjiang estuary with the length of about 56 km from the avulsion node to the river mouth fig 1 fringed with the channel is the two shoals jiuduan shoal and nanhui shoal located on the north and the south of the sp respectively within the sp yearly mean tidal range is about 3 m and mean tidal current is about 1 m s in the form of reciprocating flow bcrs 2019 recently the flow diversion of sp has been growing which suggests its increasingly important role in sediment transport and exchange processes bcrs 2019 besides the thalweg of sp has been maintained at 5 5 m for navigation since 2013 and starting from 2020 deepened into 6 m cheng et al 2023 obviously the sp has become an area profoundly affected by human exploitations 2 2 data collection 6 groups of data 4 for hydrological records table s1 and 2 for morphological data were collected through several paths to portray and analyze the hydro morphodynamics of the sp within recent decades in this study the first group is the monthly water discharge and suspended sediment concentration in the period of 1959 2020 at datong station the tidal limit of the changjiang estuary fig 1a acquired from the bulletin of china river sediment bcrs http www cjh com cn suspended sediment flux and discharge were attained by simple differential and integral method based on the data through analyzing this dataset transfer of water sediment regime directly related to the estuary would be unraveled on different time scales which is the essential terrestrial force on morphology of deltaic channels the second set of data is the raw measured hourly water level at zhongjun the tidal gauge station in the midst of the sp fig 1b over recent two decades which was collected by the national marine data center http mds nmdis org cn yearly mean sea level and yearly mean tidal range were extracted based on this dataset this group could express recent conditions of sea level rise and change in tidal range at the inner sp providing helpful information for marine dynamics the third group of hydrological data is the depth average tidal current and ssc covering a representative spring tidal cycle in corresponding period of august at two fixed hydrological observation sites fig 1b in 2005 2007 2018 and 2019 this collection of data was obtained from the changjiang estuary waterway administration bureau ministry of transportation of china cewab http www cjkhd com this set was used for inspecting the local tidal current and ssc inextricably linked with the transfer of sediment transport in sp the fourth set of data is the flow diversion ratios between the sp and another channel north passage on semi annual scale since the diversion engineer in 1998 which was also collected by the cewab http www cjkhd com the dataset was obtained by calculating the specific value of water and ssc flux through the fixed profile at the sp to the total amount the measured profiles are located at the upper midst of the two channels fig 1c divided as flood and ebb phase the ratios can reflect the dominance transition of water sediment transport from both upper distributary and outer mouth which can be served as the additional material for the local hydrological environment the fifth set of data is the high precision bathymetric data composed of depth data in 1959 and 1979 digitized from the nautical chart and 50 contiguous surveys during 1997 2021 executed by the cewab table s2 vertical accuracy of the nautical chart is 0 1 m recorded by the deso 17 echo sounder and horizontal error is 1 m by the trimble gps devices zhou et al 2020 the surveys were undertaken on a semiannual scale covering sp mostly in february and august on scale of 1 25 000 before 2004 and 1 10 000 after 2004 via single frequency sounding technology and multibeam echo sounder from konsberg maritime with vertical error of 0 1 m and positioning error of 1 m the bathymetric data are based on the beijing 54 coordinate system and theoretical lowest astronomical tide datum tlad with positive values below the datum and negative values above by processing the time series bathymetric changes regional morphodynamics can be portrayed and furtherly analyzed the sixth group of data is the fused images of landsat imagery in each year during 1997 2021 which were derived through the google earth engine gee taken as the corresponding land edge reference against annual subtidal bathymetric record considering the limitation of blind zones existing in shallow areas by shipping survey these remote images can also display dynamics of the coastline and bars in the river mouth in addition large estuarine engineering projects and landscape changes can be directly perceived through the images 2 3 methodology here data collected from bathymetric surveys were particularly introduced bathymetric data points of each survey were connected into triangulate interpolate network tin and subsequently transferred to digital elevation model dem at a resolution of 50 m 50 m which was widely and validly applied in many geomorphological studies e g wei et al 2019 zhou et al 2020 notably to mitigate the error caused by the existence of the blank data zone for some years a common data region was clipped out for long term quantitative expression which covers more than 80 of the area within the sp fig 1c based on the dems the 5 m isobath lines regarded as the boundary of the shoal and channel in subtidal zone dai 2021 were subtracted to portray the changes of the contours of the sp channel furthermore the volume change of the common region was obtained by subtraction considering partial accretion erosion and overall net variation to highlight the specific and major changes within long and short term timespans intervals of 20 and 3 year were considered the processing steps were mainly performed on the arcgis 10 8 and python programming platform in order to extract the major features of morphodynamics effectively and concisely the empirical orthogonal function eof was applied which is a statistical method to retrieve orthogonal i e independent components which contain certain physical meanings within multi dimension datasets miller and dean 2007 since the beginning of the new millennium this technique has been widely used in meteorology oceanography geology and sedimentology hannachi et al 2007 alvera azcárate et al 2005 mei et al 2018 here the time series of 2 d bathymetric anomaly values i e the normalized dems were assembled into a matrix expressed as x m n with subscript m as the spatial element per timing and n as the timing number typically the covariance matrix c m m can be given by c x x t and then the eigenvalue problem can be expressed by cv v λ where the columns of matrix v are the eigenvectors eofs and the leading diagonal of matrix λ denotes the eigenvalues thus the principal components w also regarded as the temporal eigenweighting coefficients of each eof can be obtained by w v t x using the singular value decomposition method the eof problem can be solved efficiently generally the eigenvalues which mean the variance of the eofs can be realigned into a sequence λ λ1 λ2 λm from largest to smallest therefore the variance contribution of each eigenvalue r k and the cumulative contribution for the first pth eigenvalues g p can be expressed as dai et al 2013 r k λ k i 1 m λ i k 1 2 p p m g p i 1 p λ i i 1 m λ i p m here if g p is over 75 the corresponding spatial eofs and temporal coefficients are considered as the main characteristics of the original bathymetric information and the rest of the small portions are ignored emery and thomson 2001 lane 2004 dai et al 2013 3 results 3 1 variation in the hydrological and sediment conditions 3 1 1 transfer in water discharge and ssd delivered into estuary the annual mean water discharge from datong to the cjd fluctuated around a stable level of 8 9 1011 m3 yr during 1959 2020 and experienced a rising phase within the recent decade fig 2 c water discharge showed obvious alteration in flood and dry seasons fig 2a the mean water discharge in flood seasons were 3 89 104 4 09 104 and 3 78 104 m3 s during 1959 1979 1979 2000 and 2000 2020 while that in dry seasons stepwise increased from 1 58 104 to 1 72 104 and to 1 84 104 m3 s fig 2a it means that water discharge tended to be not flooded in the flood season and not drought in the dry season even though the yearly water discharge changed little over the past 60 years fig 2e in contrast the suspended sediment transferred into changjiang estuary was of dramatic variation during the past six decades the annual mean suspended sediment discharge ssd from datong station suffered a decline from 4 6 108 t yr during the period of 1959 1979 to 3 8 108 t yr of 1979 2000 subsequently dropped even faster to 1 6 108 t yr within 2000 2020 fig 2d furthermore the acceleration phases of descent were sparked after the completion of gezhouba dam gd and three gorges dam tgd in 1981 and 2003 respectively fig 2d obviously enormous reduction over 70 was taken place in ssd over the past several decades fig 2d f which was particularly manifested in the seasonality that the sediment flux decreased from 2 54 104 kg s to 0 8 104 kg s in flood seasons and 0 38 104 kg s to 0 19 104 kg s in dry seasons indicating the huge retention effect for sediment caused by dam construction in the watershed fig 2b 3 1 2 change in the regional hydrological ambient the monthly mean water level recorded at zhongjun station grew at a rate of 0 75 cm yr at a significant level of 0 001 during 2000 to 2020 and manifested as high values in flood seasons whereas low values in dry seasons with difference between the two reaching over 50 cm fig 3 b besides the monthly mean tidal range maintained at the mean 313 cm during the past 20 years and shared similar seasonal changes with the mean water level fig 3b depth average flow in the whole channel of sp is reciprocating type with the maximum velocity of both flood and ebb currents surpassing 1 5 m s fig 3c f net tidal currents were all seaward meaning ebb flow dominated the currents during the spring tide in summer magnitude of the net current velocity was 0 5 m s in 2005 and then dropped to 0 41 0 42 m s in 2007 2018 2019 at the upper site s1 fig 3d while the largest mean velocity was 0 54 m s in 2007 at the lower site s2 with 0 32 0 34 m s in the other years fig 3g overall the ebb dominant tidal current reduced in recent years indicating the seaward sediment transport was in attenuation the current direction altered from 145 to 123 and from 105 to 94 during 2005 2007 at s1 and s2 with respective fig 3d g in other words the flow direction changed northerly by more than 10 during 2005 2007 at the two sites following which southerly adjustments were taken place in 2018 and 2019 eventually oriented to 130 133 and 116 122 at s1 and s2 respectively fig 3d g ssc at the sp was generally in decline from 0 99 kg m3 to 0 40 kg m3 at s1 and from 1 38 kg m3 to 0 90 kg m3 at s2 fig 3e h which was similar to the reduction of upstream ssd notably discrepancy exits at the inflection point of upper and lower sites that the large scale decrease in ssc at s1 happened during 2005 2007 and 2018 2019 fig 3e but at s2 it was during 2007 2018 fig 3h indicating that ssc of the upper estuary was more sensitive to the fluvial changes than the lower generally the local sediment transport regime was altered with the variations in tidal current and ssc 3 2 morphodynamic alteration of the sp 3 2 1 deformation of the channel contours the 5 m isobaths are generally regarded as the boundary between shoal and channel in the cjd based on the antecedent empirical judgement chen et al 2008 dai 2021 meaning that it can portray the marginal form of channel in the sp the upper 5 m contour line has undergone tumultuous changes in the first few decades with the 6 5 km broad channel in 1959 altered into the southern emerging bulge in 1979 which was subsequently integrated into the dilating jiuduan shoal and shaped a narrow outlet of about 2 8 km in width in 1997 fig 4 a it corresponded to the avulsion and transformation of a huge flushed deposit in the upper channel fig s1 simultaneously the lower part of the contour expanded northward by up to 3 5 km at its southern side and 2 2 km at the northern side from 1959 to 1979 fig 4a indicating elongation and constriction of the channel however despite the southerly extension by about 2 km of the northern edge an equivalent retreat occurred on the south during 1979 1997 which signifies the outer channel changed little in its width but adjusted its orientation to the south in this period fig 4a progressive modulations at the edge of channel were expressed by the 5 m isobath every three consecutive years since 1997 fig 4b i as the reference objects remote sensing images in a characteristic band of the corresponding latter years reflect changes on aerial morphology generally evident variations were concentrated in three positions the southern edge the emerging deposit termed as the jiangya shoal and the periphery of the jiuduan shoal the southern edge slightly moved south at its upper part while shifted north at lower part during 1997 2000 fig 4b and then experienced a period of fluctuation fig 4c e until the outer section extruded outsides by about 1 5 km in 2012 fig 4f after which the whole began to withdraw continuously by a magnitude up to 3 1 km with a concave formation in the middle during the period of 2012 2021 fig 4g i after formation the 5 m contour of the jiangya shoal had a macroscopic change with its barycenter moving downstream and the protrusion separated from the original accumulation and pushed longitudinally by a distance of 33 km fig 4b i such a progress finally built a compound channel configuration from the single one with the north elongated ditch cutting off the jiuduan shoal as for the edge of the jiuduan shoal area increased a lot during 1959 1997 fig 4a and then the contour entered an adjustment in the period of 1997 2021 when the tip of the tail was shaped fig 4d and a dent was dug out in progress fig 4g i 3 2 2 variation in channel shoal volumes the whole sp was silted up with the mean depth decreased from 6 4 m to 4 9 m during 1959 1997 after which it was deepened at a rate of 0 03 m yr and the mean depth was back to 5 8 m fig 5 a furtherly volume between 0 m and 5 m termed as zone of shoal experienced considerable decline by a magnitude of 1 5 108 m3 during 1959 1997 and then rises by little after 1997 fig 5b meanwhile volume below 5 m termed as zone of channel decreased by more than 2 5 108 m3 from 1959 to 1979 and kept stable during 1979 1997 with a fairly low level of growth and subsequently increased at a rate of about 1 0 107 m3 yr fig 5c overall the volumes in different vertical ranges had different variation curves with the asynchrony presented in the volumes change of shoal and channel i e scouring in channel earlier than shoal dramatic alteration was visible on various timescales over the past decades during 1959 to 1979 the sp was silted up rapidly at a net rate of 1 6 107 m3 yr with deposition rate eight times more than erosion fig 6 a b followed by which was a moderate net accretion by 5 5 106 m3 yr in the subsequent period of 1979 1997 and was then scoured by 1 1 107 m3 yr within the recent 25 years fig 6a b this bi decadal change indicates the sedimentary transition process of the sp which was altered from rapid deposition into dramatic erosion moreover in the recent 25 years at scale of 3 years presence of net erosion was significant at least by 8 0 106 m3 yr apart from the minuscule net deposition in the period of 2000 2003 and 2006 2009 fig 6c d furthermore it s obvious that an even greater rate of scouring was growing from 2015 fig 6c d no doubt that the trend reversals of the deposition erosion process became intensified in the past two decades 3 2 3 pattern of the deposition erosion process according to the eof of the dems the major modes of the morphological change in time and space after 1997 were obtained the eof result showed that the variation in bathymetric data during 1997 2021 were mainly contributed by the first two eigenmodes which cover 75 of the explanatory variance proportion fig 7 with each of the remaining modes lower than 10 hence the first two modes represent the dominant patterns of morphological variation in the sp while the others of small standardized variance are negligible emery and thomson 2001 dai et al 2016 the first mode accounts for 61 fig 7a in which the contour surface shows markedly extreme positive or negative values along the channel in the upper and central part and smaller values distributed in the estuary mouth zones of the positive values denoting the deposition mainly coincide with the area of higher depth while the negative ones i e eroding ones overlap with lower fig 1c fig 7a which indicates deposition in the jiangya shoal and deepening in the channel that s to say seaward elongation of both the compound channel and the tail of jiangya shoal dominates the evolution progress in the past 25 years consistent with the channel contour evolution fig 4 curve of the temporal coefficients shows a near linear growth trend fig 7b which is positively correlated well r 0 93 p 0 01 to the volume below 5 m fig 7c meaning deep channel deepening was the dominant explanation of the deposition erosion process within recent 25 years in the sp the second eigenmode takes up 14 of the variance magnitude of the eigenvector is not so great as the first mode with smaller plaques signifying slight deposition or erosion across the main upper channel fig 7d odd stripes with positive and negative values are distributed in the middle of the sp which is likely to coincide with the diversion engineering fig 1c fig 7d the evident positive values concentrated around the lower mouth suggest deposition occurred near the nanhui shoal fig 7d the temporal curve of this mode shows an inverted u shape representing ups during 1998 2007 flats during 2007 2010 and downs during 2010 2019 fig 7d notably a drop from 1997 to 1998 and a period of stabilization during 2019 2021 are presented which correspond with two deluge events in 1998 and 2020 the curve shares negative correlation r 0 67 p 0 01 with the volume within 0 5 m fig 7f indicating the transition in the evolution process of the shoal where accretion firstly happened and then slight scour began to emerge following the brief stagnation during 2007 2010 in general the second mode may suggest partial morphodynamic adjustment induced by episodic event such as engineering and extreme hydrological story which was mainly presented on deposition erosion shift of shoal zones in sp within the period 4 discussion 4 1 the impacts of reservoirs along the changjiang river similar to other deltas through the world syvitski et al 2009 nienhuis et al 2020 the sp was suffering alteration from human interventions at distal sides in the period of 1960s and 1970s several reservoirs were constructed in the upper reaches of the changjiang river which may be the reason causing the slight decline of the ssd exported to the river mouth dai 2021 during 1980s the completion of the gezhouba dam ushered the era of dams architecting on the stem stream of changjiang river dai 2021 making more severe reduction of the sediment load in the lower watershed fig 2d f with the construction of the tgd at the middle of changjiang river since 2003 the sediment reduction has been further deteriorated in spite of stabilization in the water discharge fig 2 the explanation of such a hydrological effect by dams is that sediment can be settled when the flow is mitigated or even blocked but cannot be entrained while the regulated flow is freed again yang et al 2011 dai et al 2018 correlation analysis was used to find out the relationship between upstream hydrological environment and the morphology of the sp under the intensified dam construction it shows that the volume of 0 5 m shares a positive correlation r 0 44 p 0 05 with the water discharge fig 9a meaning that the higher water discharge is corresponding the erosion at the shoal besides a negative correlation r 0 63 p 0 01 is between the sediment flux and the volume below 5 m fig 9d which implies that infilling of the channel is sensitive to the fluvial sediment supply however the subtidal volume within 0 5 m or below 5 m is not correlated to the ssd or the water discharge respectively fig 9b c furthermore by comparison the impact by the tgd on channel is much greater than on shoal shown as increased channel capacity and little change of shoal in the post tgd period fig 9a d this mechanism could provide explanation for the significantly distinct distribution of the dominant mode of eof results that the channel was sharply deepened fig 8 a for the dramatic reduction in fluvial sediment discharge the local ssc of sp also experienced dramatic reduction during recent 20 years responding to the human induced decline of sediment load fig 3e h even so the transition of the ssc showed spatial discrepancies which was manifested as the more sensitive and faster response to sediment starvation at the inner channel than the outer fig 3e h it s probably because of that marine sediment resuspension and the formation of the estuary turbidity maximum zone etm cushioned the effects of the decreasing sediment import swenson et al 2005 song and wang 2013 yang et al 2014 burchard et al 2018 leonardi et al 2021 moreover the outside subaqueous delta of the cjd has been faced with risks luo et al 2017 yang et al 2017 and phenomenon of recession yang et al 2011 wang et al 2020 which would be then served as a sediment source under the entrainment by tidal pumping yang et al 2006 zhu et al 2016 luan et al 2018 however despite the ebb dominant flow during a spring tidal cycle the net seaward flux was dampened from the beginning of this century to the present fig 3d g implying the potentially enhancing influence by flood stream that s to say with the reduction of terrestrial sediment marine dynamics could have a certain resisting effect to decline in local ssc zhang et al 2018 and this effect was greater the closer to the river mouth which could explain the high positive zone in the channel mouth of the second eof mode fig 7d in the context of sediment decline from upstream despite extensive erosion was reported in the whole cjd yang et al 2017 guo et al 2021 discrepancies could be found when talking about the specific evolution in different outlets in distinction to the sp the northernmost outlet north branch has experienced overall siltation over the past few decades for flood dominance and meandering course dai et al 2016 zhang et al 2022 besides analogous changing tendency with the sp were reported in the north channel and north passage with erosion in channel and deposition in shoal jiang et al 2012 mei et al 2018 zheng et al 2021 teng et al 2021 thereafter commonalities exist between these outlets despite under various local anthropogenic regulations which will be discussed in the following sections 4 2 the influence of waterway projects in the sp apart from the upstream reservoirs and dams the nearby engineering also affected the hydro morphology of the sp the famous deep waterway project dwp though built around the north passage has exerted great impact on the water discharge configuration of the sp with the fish mouth like dike for diversion and the south jetties finished between 1998 and 2000 fig 1c fig 9 a since 2000 the flow diversion of the sp has climbed up with the ebb tide ratio decreasing from 39 to 58 and the flood tide ratio from 51 to 70 fig 9a both making the sp a potential dominant waterway such an alteration has remade the tidal current system and influenced the morphology which is similar to the analogous researches jiang et al 2012 dai et al 2013 further the flow diversion ratio of the sp is positively correlated to the volume below 5 m whether it s during flood tide r 0 66 p 0 01 or ebb tide r 0 63 p 0 01 fig 9c e implying that the intensified ebb and flood flow proportion corresponds with bigger volumes i e erosion in deep channel however the distributary proportion seems not so relative with the volume of the shoal fig 9b d saying the shoal channel discrepancy in response to the artificial diversion regulation under stable fluvial water discharge the increased diversion ratio means the amplification of the import water volume this could enhance the reciprocating motion of the tidal current and strengthen the scouring of the river bed which may be the local dynamic force for the first eof mode fig 7a confirmed by the positive correlation between the flow ratios and volume below 5 m fig 9c e moreover after 2013 the navigation regulation project nrp began to be carried on in the sp and embankment was constructed to stabilize the south side of jiangya shoal in 2018 figs 1c 9a which would cause more variations of tidal current and subtidal water volumes it s obvious that the location of the dike and embankment coincides with the line of demarcation between positive and negative values in the second eof mode meaning that the former probably contributes to the latter fig 7d furthermore prophase movement of the avulsed deposit jiangya shoal disturbed the current field and changed the orientation northerly by more than 10 around 2007 fig 3d g which would rebound to the sediment transport regime and eventually pushed the deposit to move northward fig 4e f indicating the mutual influence between dynamics and morphology this interaction was regulated after the upper embankment of the jiangya shoal in 2018 validated in the stable currents of period between 2018 and 2019 which also enhance the compound channel configuration of the sp fig 3d g another effect brought by the waterway projects is dredging directly influencing the morphology during 2013 2014 and 2018 2020 the major section of the mouth bar was dredging for navigation fig 1c which may be the reason that the 5 m isobath was elongated at the lower part fig 4g i however although deeper channel tends to bear more powerful hydrodynamics the source sink and movement of sediment in the deltaic channels are still unpredictable under the dredging projects in the north branch dredging has prompted the overall siltation into erosion accretion balanced state recently luo et al 2017 zhang et al 2022 whereas continuous erosion in channel of the north channel and north passage caused by sand digging activities despite occasional siltation dai et al 2013 mei et al 2018 zheng et al 2021 the uncertain effects under dredging activities were also found in other waterways worldwide van maren et al 2015 ralston et al 2019 therefore how the morphology changes in the sp after the dredging projects remains uncertain and needs longer observation 4 3 the impacts of silting promotion and reclamation projects around the sp in the context of once sufficient sediment supply shoals in the cjd have experienced rapid expansion for a long time especially with the reclamation and silting promotion projects dai 2021 at the nanhui shoal on the south of the sp successive reclamation activities were conducted after 1950s which was shown that 53 km2 had reclaimed from 1958 to 1989 wei et al 2019 more extensive silting promotion projects have begun or are under way since 1994 which would eventually create reclaimed land with an acreage of 288 km2 fig 10 table 1 the edge line of the nanhui shoal has moved northeastward increasingly by about 2 8 km at the middle sp and 12 5 km at the out sp fig 4 fig 10 while the contour of channel is widened shoreward recently fig 4 thus it can be inferred that higher shoals have been piled up within the 5 m contour and the potential area for reclamation is shrinking yang et al 2017 wei et al 2019 what s worse the stepwise formation of the steep slope between shoal and channel would increase the risk of bank erosion threatening the littoral defense predictably with the processing of silting promotion reclamation and navigation development the increase of the surface slope will be a major challenge for the maintenance of shoal channel balance in the sp siltation and reclamation activities were also conducted around the other deltaic channels of cjd such as the engineering on hengsha shoal in recent years which silted up the lower reach of north channel and north passage jiang et al 2012 mei et al 2018 besides reclamation was revealed to contend with the dredging achieving the erosion deposition volume balance in the north branch zhang et al 2022 which could be a favorable action for making sustainable development however when taking a broader view inevitable recession crisis is imminent that the subaqueous delta was proved to be severely eroded under the dual pressure from coastal reclamation and sediment decline luo et al 2017 yang et al 2017 luan et al 2018 hence more works are being demanded to address the contradiction from all the different human activities mentioned above including distal and proximal side temporary sources and sinks 4 4 the alteration brought by sea level change sea level rise widely regarded as an issue with anthropogenic impact apparently influences the hydrodynamics and morphology of the cjd cheng et al 2018 lou et al 2022 rate of the sea level rise at the inner sp is about 0 75 cm yr 0 22 cm yr larger than that of the long term tidal gauge station fig 11 lvsi station which could represent the sea level outside the mouth of the cjd feng et al 2021 the increment should be due to fluvial water discharge and squeezing by the channel narrowing kuang et al 2017 cheng et al 2018 results of correlation analysis suggests that the water level is positively correlated to both the volumes of shoal r 0 56 p 0 01 and channel r 0 86 p 0 01 fig 12 a b during the recent 20 years implying that the rising sea level caused erosion in the whole sp and the channel is more sensitive than the shoal corresponding with the polarized evolutionary characteristics of the first eof mode furthermore in spite of the significant positive correlation the rate of the sea level rise was less than a quarter of 3 cm yr rate of the mean depth increasing fig 5a inferred from which the ascending sea level not only acted on the morphological change through direct inundation but probably also served as a reinforcement factor on the tidal dynamics thus on the morphology nienhuis et al 2018 leuven et al 2019 minderhoud et al 2019 yuan et al 2020 in addition it s reported that the tidal range which can be used to measure the strength of regional coastal tide had mutual nonlinear interaction with the sea level in coastal and estuarine areas wang and townend 2012 kirwan and megonigal 2013 leuven et al 2019 devlin et al 2017 lee et al 2017 here a slight positive correlation exits r 0 39 p 0 1 in the relevance between the tidal range and the volume of 0 5 m fig 12c demonstrating that the annual changing tidal range probably scours the shoal in the sp the reason is mostly that the symbiotic ups and downs of sea level and tidal range fig 3b kept shallow submerged zones accumulated through extending the period of inundation and slack stream whereas the deeper zones suffered intensified shear stress for the higher water content consistence with many former researches kirwan et al 2016 leuven et al 2019 cai et al 2022 wang et al 2022 4 5 schematic map on the evolution of the sp during 1959 2021 the sp had suffered dramatic alterations from progressively intensified anthropogenic exploitation and presented complicated evolutionary process spatially and temporally fig 12 any engineering has its instantaneous and persistent influence so cumulative effect of each relevant project and overlap effect since the engineering nodes were illustrated generally considering the riverine sediment transfer and density of the human activities and the consequent morphodynamics three main stages were demonstrated which are rapid accretion during 1959 1979 moderate accretion during 1979 1997 dramatic erosion during 1997 2021 fig 13 from 1959 to 1979 the sp was primarily affected by natural forces with little human interference and was silted up at high rate after 1981 fluvial retention by reservoirs and dams along the river watershed reduced the seaward ssd by about 17 fig 2d and subsequently slowed down the accretion rate by 60 fig 5a the turning point from deposition to erosion is in 1997 or even earlier for data blank since which large estuarine engineering and land reclamation projects have been carried out making the morphodynamics more complicated further the completion of tgd resulted in a greater amount of sediment reduction by over 70 of the first phase triggering more severe erosion over recent two decades coupled with the sea level rise hence in conclusion the deposition and erosion process of sp has stepped into an epoch dominated by intensive anthropogenic forces the spatial reshaping process shows more complication than bulk sedimentation especially in the past 25 years notably differentiation is found between shoal and channel against the deposition erosion switch i e shoal more prone to siltation and channel to erosion which accounts for the largest morphodynamic mode of the sp figs 5 7a 13 that may be because estuarine densified water current is inclined to form a stratified structure and channel shoal shear front blocking sedimentation in the deep channel burchard et al 2018 therefore the aggradation of jiuduan shoal jiangya shoal and nanhui shoal was visible despite the ongoing sediment starvation and sea level rise fig s1 however although keeping the seaward expansion of the nanhui shoal the multiple reclamation projects were reducing the possibility of shoal s dilation and breaking the balance between shoal and channel with the formation of abrupt slope figs s1 13 besides embankment of the south jiangya shoal built in 2018 hampers sediment exchange between the inner channel and shoal and may intensify the dynamics mentioned above fig s1 since the time is too short to determinate the variation quantitatively longer period of observation is required for further research setting aside this limitation more attention is suggested to concentrate on defending potential erosion risks caused by sediment transfer when developing the reclaimed land in addition to determine the favorable locations for dredged soil should be helpful in keeping the shoal channel balance and sustainable development with dredging becoming a main management approach in the present and foreseeable future 5 conclusion long term hydro morphodynamics of the channels in river deltas is widely concerned in the context of the human induced sediment reduction sea level rise and intensive intervention caused by estuarine engineering by analyzing the long term series of hydrological and morphological data with high resolution we investigated the deposition erosion process of the sp in the cjd under compound factors over the past 60 years the main conclusions are as follows 1 during 1959 2020 riverine sediment exported to the cjd has experienced dramatic decline which promoted the morphodynamics of the sp from high accretion to sharp erosion in the context of the dam retention the ssd is found to decrease by over 70 since 1959 which probably cut down the local ssc of the sp by about 50 this process of sediment transfer both distally and proximally corresponded with the three evolution phases in the sp rapid accretion 1959 1979 moderate deposition 1979 1997 and dramatic erosion 1997 2021 2 the three deposition erosion phases contain exclusive landscape characteristics at the first and second phase formation and movement of the jiangya shoal and narrowing of the upper channel were the main rhythms accompanied with enormous deposition at rate of 1 6 107 m3 yr and 5 5 106 m3 yr respectively at the third phase with highly scouring by 1 1 107 m3 yr channel was deepened and elongated while shoal extended seaward as well significantly asynchronous performances were found between zones of shoal and channel within the morphodynamic process of sp manifested as channel suffered rapid erosion even faster than the shoal with the latter maintain a deposition or minor erosion state 3 to further explore the recent erosion phase in depth evolutionary pattern was revealed by the eof method results showed the first mode accounted for 61 of the total variance and suggested a near linear continuous erosion of channel dominated the morphological alteration over the past 25 years under the huge sediment reduction rising sea level and increasing flow diversion the second mode taking up 14 shifted from increasing state into decreasing around 2010 which mainly describes overall transition from deposition to erosion of shoal zone and explains adjustment to episodic events enhanced flood force and local engineering constructions such a discrepancy would also be accentuated by the dredging on channel and reclamation on tidal flat or even subtidal shoal which reduced the subaqueous shallow space

1788,deltaic channels as the essential part in system of river deltas where river and ocean connect are influenced profoundly on its deposition and erosion processes by changes of riverine sediment due to human activities from catchment to mouth of large rivers and sea level rise worldwide here based on a series of hydrological sedimentary and morphological records in the main outer channel south passage sp of the river tide dominant changjiang yangtze delta cjd for more than half a century regional deposition erosion process and the implication mechanism were examined the results showed that fluvial sediment supply declined by over 70 stepwise during the past decades and local suspended sediment concentration in the sp reduced by half within recent years correspondingly three distinct stages of morphodynamic process came out one after another which were phases of rapid deposition 1959 1979 moderate deposition 1979 1997 and dramatic erosion 1997 2021 respectively channel and shoal had asynchronous performance during this deposition erosion transition especially after 1979 when channel entered a rapid erosion period earlier after a stable volume period while shoal suffered slow erosion after high speed deposition moreover the current erosion phase was furtherly explained as two main modes by the empirical orthogonal function analysis accounting for 61 and 14 respectively the dominant mode describes the continuous scouring in channel contributed by transfer in riverine sediment regime consisting of the reducing upstream sediment local increasing flow diversion dredging activities and sea level rise the second mode suggests decadal shift from deposition to slight erosion of shoal zones which was also adjusted to episodic events and local engineering projects like shoal embankment and reclamation it s predictable that the sp would constantly suffer long term erosion under riverine sediment reduction sea level rise and artificial waterway regulation together with aggradation of the fringing shoals by reclamation this highlights channels in the river deltas are faced with the erosion risk caused by anthropogenic activities which calls for compelling attention keywords deposition and erosion anthropogenic activities water and sediment transfer morphodynamic process south passage changjiang delta data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction river deltas provide significant habitats for organism which accommodate more than 300 million people in the world edmonds et al 2020 channels distributed over river deltas play important roles in coastal areas providing unique ecological habitat and significant navigation value for littoral economic and commercial development giosan et al 2014 leuven et al 2019 however the worldwide deltaic channels of most fluvial tidal deltas were in drastic changes attributed to transfer in the riverine estuarine sediment supply and transport caused by human activities syvitski et al 2005 nienhuis et al 2020 it s urgent to disentangle the deposition and erosion process of deltaic channels in response to the sediment transfer induced by intensive anthropogenic perturbation with which the exact mechanism still under debate syvitski et al 2009 nienhuis et al 2020 fluvial sediment exported to deltas manifests as two opposite trends driven by anthropogenic activities which are deforestation induced increases and reservoir or dam induced reductions syvitski et al 2005 nienhuis et al 2020 threatening the settlements of coastal people the decline of riverine sediment compounded with sea level rise is particularly concerned in many river deltas e g syvitski et al 2009 giosan et al 2014 schuerch et al 2018 serving as the conveyor and carrier of the material deltaic channels could be susceptible to the far filed sediment reduction such as in mekong delta and danube delta giosan et al 2013 anthony et al 2015 which increases the risk of coastal erosion a typical example is transition in water sediment regime of the yellow river delta in china where riparian land dilated and main channel narrowed for numerous sediment supply before regulation wang et al 2006 and subsequently the deltaic channel converted into erosion ji et al 2022 it s also proclaimed that the mouth channel length is more related to the cumulative riverine sediment rather than the changing sediment size shi et al 2019 though there are some rivers whose upstream sediment supply is affected by human activities e g liu et al 2014 anthony et al 2015 large deltas worldwide are lean to cope badly with sea level rise in the context of human induced sediment starvation syvitski et al 2009 yang et al 2011 nienhuis et al 2020 cox et al 2021 deltaic channels are artificially deepened by dredging strategy and sand excavation in sake of service for highly populated settlement and rapid urbanization anthony et al 2014 ralston et al 2019 channel deepening poses immediate effect to the morphodynamics which even overpasses that is brought by the reducing sediment at some extent such as the substantial incision after large scale sand excavation in the pearl river delta and limited impact when prohibition liu et al 2019 in the upper hudson estuary of u s ralston et al 2019 pointed out that dredging caused reduction of friction and sharp switch from tide decaying landward to tidal amplifying additionally with farther propagation of storm and lowered flooding which would strengthen the hydrodynamics to keep processive scouring however morphological changes caused by artificial channel deepening are not so exact for the reason of that the transport of sediment transport up estuary could be enhanced due to increased salinity driven circulation found by van maren et al 2015 in the ems estuary of netherland wu et al 2020 also found channel infilling after dredging project in the waterway of shenzhen river china cox et al 2022 furtherly noted that channel deepening could become ineffective under the sea level rise conditions due to sediment entrained landward by reinforced flood dominant tides even so the dredging and sand mining spawning macroscopic erosion are responsible for drown and risk to flooding defense in coastal zones liu et al 2019 cox et al 2022 in other words in spite of the benefit to navigation channel dredging could annoy morphologic stability and ecologic sustainability of the estuary hard engineering constructed in estuaries for various needs including ecological restoration storm defense land expansion and navigation stabilization rigorously disrupts the sediment transport and dynamic morphological equilibrium ceia et al 2010 elliott et al 2016 hoitink et al 2017 huguet et al 2018 in the danube estuary although human relevant reduction of sediment and erosion was aggravated hard engineering protection slowed down the coastal retreat and kept compete with the acceleration of the sea level rise giosan et al 2013 however it s found that embankments could probably lead to continuously severe scouring at the channel bed exerting potential risk for a longer period hoitink et al 2017 channel diversion with guide levees could also trigger sediment transfer along estuary making deposition erosion transition spatially and temporally such as the lowermost mississippi and atchafalaya system in america allison et al 2012 another type of engineering in estuary is reclamation which was investigated to make sense on the tidal amplification and bring risk of bank erosion pluvial flooding and navigation difficulty in granges brahmaputra delta van maren et al 2023 but bain et al 2019 s regional research suggested that embankment construction had immediate effect of driving a regional decline in tidal prism and discharge in the shibsa channel of the south ganges brahmaputra delta with the opposite shoaling effect to the channel basin volume therefore reclamation could bring distinct influence to the distributary channels of river delta especially in the complicated ambient of sediment starvation and sea level rise the outer channels i e the four distributary mouths north branch north channel north passage and south passage in changjiang river delta are in different evolutionary states in the context of sediment alteration dai 2021 on account of the minimal fluvial discharge and enhanced flood tide current the north branch was announced to be filled up during nearly half a century dai et al 2016 in the north channel erosion was observed along the inner channel for decline in riverine sediment especially since sediment retention by the three gorges dam in 2003 while accretion and narrowing were found in the lower channel which could be explained by tidal pumping mei et al 2018 as for the north passage the most regulated by artificial jetties and groins in the delta over the past decades peripheral groin fields silted up and channel was deepened by regular dredging jiang et al 2012 dai 2021 further adjacent to the channels the changjiang submerged delta could face with recession under human regulations and climate changes within recent decades in response to the sediment reduction caused by upstream dam construction e g yang et al 2017 dai et al 2018 while north passage is already one of the important deepwater waterways the south passage sp is a major water sediment discharge channel of the changjiang delta with the deposition erosion regime directly influenced by upstream sediment transfer simultaneously along both sides of the sp lie the broadest land derived tidal flat nanhui shoal and the largest uninhabited land jiuduan shoal of the delta additionally the sp is also the outlet closest to the population center whose evolution affects maritime transportation the development and safety of the littoral areas and the wetland ecosystem hence as the essential access of sediment transport with the center of the megacity shanghai on its south the sp plays a crucial role in the deltaic system dai 2021 within the recent decades in addition to the upstream sediment transfer the sp may be also influenced by a succession of artificial engineering projects including land reclamation diversion regulation guided jetties and dredging projects which could prompt the deposition erosion process into a rather complicated issue but with little specific exploration hence data of long term high resolution bathymetric surveys riverine water sediment records over half a century multi temporal landsat images in recent two decades and measured hydrological data of sp were processed here aiming to 1 elaborate the erosion and deposition process of the sp over the period 1959 2021 2 unveil the morphodynamic evolution pattern of this deltaic channel and 3 ascertain the major factors exerted on the erosion deposition process of the sp 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area changjiang river estuary 640 km inland from its tidal reaching limit datong anhui province nourishes one of the largest deltas in china chen et al 1999 fig 1 covering an area of about 358 000 km2 accommodating more than 220 million people and generating over 20 of gdp in china changjiang delta is one of the core regions of socio economic development four outer channels keep the land sea interaction in this deltaic system dai 2021 the sp is the southernmost waterway of the changjiang estuary with the length of about 56 km from the avulsion node to the river mouth fig 1 fringed with the channel is the two shoals jiuduan shoal and nanhui shoal located on the north and the south of the sp respectively within the sp yearly mean tidal range is about 3 m and mean tidal current is about 1 m s in the form of reciprocating flow bcrs 2019 recently the flow diversion of sp has been growing which suggests its increasingly important role in sediment transport and exchange processes bcrs 2019 besides the thalweg of sp has been maintained at 5 5 m for navigation since 2013 and starting from 2020 deepened into 6 m cheng et al 2023 obviously the sp has become an area profoundly affected by human exploitations 2 2 data collection 6 groups of data 4 for hydrological records table s1 and 2 for morphological data were collected through several paths to portray and analyze the hydro morphodynamics of the sp within recent decades in this study the first group is the monthly water discharge and suspended sediment concentration in the period of 1959 2020 at datong station the tidal limit of the changjiang estuary fig 1a acquired from the bulletin of china river sediment bcrs http www cjh com cn suspended sediment flux and discharge were attained by simple differential and integral method based on the data through analyzing this dataset transfer of water sediment regime directly related to the estuary would be unraveled on different time scales which is the essential terrestrial force on morphology of deltaic channels the second set of data is the raw measured hourly water level at zhongjun the tidal gauge station in the midst of the sp fig 1b over recent two decades which was collected by the national marine data center http mds nmdis org cn yearly mean sea level and yearly mean tidal range were extracted based on this dataset this group could express recent conditions of sea level rise and change in tidal range at the inner sp providing helpful information for marine dynamics the third group of hydrological data is the depth average tidal current and ssc covering a representative spring tidal cycle in corresponding period of august at two fixed hydrological observation sites fig 1b in 2005 2007 2018 and 2019 this collection of data was obtained from the changjiang estuary waterway administration bureau ministry of transportation of china cewab http www cjkhd com this set was used for inspecting the local tidal current and ssc inextricably linked with the transfer of sediment transport in sp the fourth set of data is the flow diversion ratios between the sp and another channel north passage on semi annual scale since the diversion engineer in 1998 which was also collected by the cewab http www cjkhd com the dataset was obtained by calculating the specific value of water and ssc flux through the fixed profile at the sp to the total amount the measured profiles are located at the upper midst of the two channels fig 1c divided as flood and ebb phase the ratios can reflect the dominance transition of water sediment transport from both upper distributary and outer mouth which can be served as the additional material for the local hydrological environment the fifth set of data is the high precision bathymetric data composed of depth data in 1959 and 1979 digitized from the nautical chart and 50 contiguous surveys during 1997 2021 executed by the cewab table s2 vertical accuracy of the nautical chart is 0 1 m recorded by the deso 17 echo sounder and horizontal error is 1 m by the trimble gps devices zhou et al 2020 the surveys were undertaken on a semiannual scale covering sp mostly in february and august on scale of 1 25 000 before 2004 and 1 10 000 after 2004 via single frequency sounding technology and multibeam echo sounder from konsberg maritime with vertical error of 0 1 m and positioning error of 1 m the bathymetric data are based on the beijing 54 coordinate system and theoretical lowest astronomical tide datum tlad with positive values below the datum and negative values above by processing the time series bathymetric changes regional morphodynamics can be portrayed and furtherly analyzed the sixth group of data is the fused images of landsat imagery in each year during 1997 2021 which were derived through the google earth engine gee taken as the corresponding land edge reference against annual subtidal bathymetric record considering the limitation of blind zones existing in shallow areas by shipping survey these remote images can also display dynamics of the coastline and bars in the river mouth in addition large estuarine engineering projects and landscape changes can be directly perceived through the images 2 3 methodology here data collected from bathymetric surveys were particularly introduced bathymetric data points of each survey were connected into triangulate interpolate network tin and subsequently transferred to digital elevation model dem at a resolution of 50 m 50 m which was widely and validly applied in many geomorphological studies e g wei et al 2019 zhou et al 2020 notably to mitigate the error caused by the existence of the blank data zone for some years a common data region was clipped out for long term quantitative expression which covers more than 80 of the area within the sp fig 1c based on the dems the 5 m isobath lines regarded as the boundary of the shoal and channel in subtidal zone dai 2021 were subtracted to portray the changes of the contours of the sp channel furthermore the volume change of the common region was obtained by subtraction considering partial accretion erosion and overall net variation to highlight the specific and major changes within long and short term timespans intervals of 20 and 3 year were considered the processing steps were mainly performed on the arcgis 10 8 and python programming platform in order to extract the major features of morphodynamics effectively and concisely the empirical orthogonal function eof was applied which is a statistical method to retrieve orthogonal i e independent components which contain certain physical meanings within multi dimension datasets miller and dean 2007 since the beginning of the new millennium this technique has been widely used in meteorology oceanography geology and sedimentology hannachi et al 2007 alvera azcárate et al 2005 mei et al 2018 here the time series of 2 d bathymetric anomaly values i e the normalized dems were assembled into a matrix expressed as x m n with subscript m as the spatial element per timing and n as the timing number typically the covariance matrix c m m can be given by c x x t and then the eigenvalue problem can be expressed by cv v λ where the columns of matrix v are the eigenvectors eofs and the leading diagonal of matrix λ denotes the eigenvalues thus the principal components w also regarded as the temporal eigenweighting coefficients of each eof can be obtained by w v t x using the singular value decomposition method the eof problem can be solved efficiently generally the eigenvalues which mean the variance of the eofs can be realigned into a sequence λ λ1 λ2 λm from largest to smallest therefore the variance contribution of each eigenvalue r k and the cumulative contribution for the first pth eigenvalues g p can be expressed as dai et al 2013 r k λ k i 1 m λ i k 1 2 p p m g p i 1 p λ i i 1 m λ i p m here if g p is over 75 the corresponding spatial eofs and temporal coefficients are considered as the main characteristics of the original bathymetric information and the rest of the small portions are ignored emery and thomson 2001 lane 2004 dai et al 2013 3 results 3 1 variation in the hydrological and sediment conditions 3 1 1 transfer in water discharge and ssd delivered into estuary the annual mean water discharge from datong to the cjd fluctuated around a stable level of 8 9 1011 m3 yr during 1959 2020 and experienced a rising phase within the recent decade fig 2 c water discharge showed obvious alteration in flood and dry seasons fig 2a the mean water discharge in flood seasons were 3 89 104 4 09 104 and 3 78 104 m3 s during 1959 1979 1979 2000 and 2000 2020 while that in dry seasons stepwise increased from 1 58 104 to 1 72 104 and to 1 84 104 m3 s fig 2a it means that water discharge tended to be not flooded in the flood season and not drought in the dry season even though the yearly water discharge changed little over the past 60 years fig 2e in contrast the suspended sediment transferred into changjiang estuary was of dramatic variation during the past six decades the annual mean suspended sediment discharge ssd from datong station suffered a decline from 4 6 108 t yr during the period of 1959 1979 to 3 8 108 t yr of 1979 2000 subsequently dropped even faster to 1 6 108 t yr within 2000 2020 fig 2d furthermore the acceleration phases of descent were sparked after the completion of gezhouba dam gd and three gorges dam tgd in 1981 and 2003 respectively fig 2d obviously enormous reduction over 70 was taken place in ssd over the past several decades fig 2d f which was particularly manifested in the seasonality that the sediment flux decreased from 2 54 104 kg s to 0 8 104 kg s in flood seasons and 0 38 104 kg s to 0 19 104 kg s in dry seasons indicating the huge retention effect for sediment caused by dam construction in the watershed fig 2b 3 1 2 change in the regional hydrological ambient the monthly mean water level recorded at zhongjun station grew at a rate of 0 75 cm yr at a significant level of 0 001 during 2000 to 2020 and manifested as high values in flood seasons whereas low values in dry seasons with difference between the two reaching over 50 cm fig 3 b besides the monthly mean tidal range maintained at the mean 313 cm during the past 20 years and shared similar seasonal changes with the mean water level fig 3b depth average flow in the whole channel of sp is reciprocating type with the maximum velocity of both flood and ebb currents surpassing 1 5 m s fig 3c f net tidal currents were all seaward meaning ebb flow dominated the currents during the spring tide in summer magnitude of the net current velocity was 0 5 m s in 2005 and then dropped to 0 41 0 42 m s in 2007 2018 2019 at the upper site s1 fig 3d while the largest mean velocity was 0 54 m s in 2007 at the lower site s2 with 0 32 0 34 m s in the other years fig 3g overall the ebb dominant tidal current reduced in recent years indicating the seaward sediment transport was in attenuation the current direction altered from 145 to 123 and from 105 to 94 during 2005 2007 at s1 and s2 with respective fig 3d g in other words the flow direction changed northerly by more than 10 during 2005 2007 at the two sites following which southerly adjustments were taken place in 2018 and 2019 eventually oriented to 130 133 and 116 122 at s1 and s2 respectively fig 3d g ssc at the sp was generally in decline from 0 99 kg m3 to 0 40 kg m3 at s1 and from 1 38 kg m3 to 0 90 kg m3 at s2 fig 3e h which was similar to the reduction of upstream ssd notably discrepancy exits at the inflection point of upper and lower sites that the large scale decrease in ssc at s1 happened during 2005 2007 and 2018 2019 fig 3e but at s2 it was during 2007 2018 fig 3h indicating that ssc of the upper estuary was more sensitive to the fluvial changes than the lower generally the local sediment transport regime was altered with the variations in tidal current and ssc 3 2 morphodynamic alteration of the sp 3 2 1 deformation of the channel contours the 5 m isobaths are generally regarded as the boundary between shoal and channel in the cjd based on the antecedent empirical judgement chen et al 2008 dai 2021 meaning that it can portray the marginal form of channel in the sp the upper 5 m contour line has undergone tumultuous changes in the first few decades with the 6 5 km broad channel in 1959 altered into the southern emerging bulge in 1979 which was subsequently integrated into the dilating jiuduan shoal and shaped a narrow outlet of about 2 8 km in width in 1997 fig 4 a it corresponded to the avulsion and transformation of a huge flushed deposit in the upper channel fig s1 simultaneously the lower part of the contour expanded northward by up to 3 5 km at its southern side and 2 2 km at the northern side from 1959 to 1979 fig 4a indicating elongation and constriction of the channel however despite the southerly extension by about 2 km of the northern edge an equivalent retreat occurred on the south during 1979 1997 which signifies the outer channel changed little in its width but adjusted its orientation to the south in this period fig 4a progressive modulations at the edge of channel were expressed by the 5 m isobath every three consecutive years since 1997 fig 4b i as the reference objects remote sensing images in a characteristic band of the corresponding latter years reflect changes on aerial morphology generally evident variations were concentrated in three positions the southern edge the emerging deposit termed as the jiangya shoal and the periphery of the jiuduan shoal the southern edge slightly moved south at its upper part while shifted north at lower part during 1997 2000 fig 4b and then experienced a period of fluctuation fig 4c e until the outer section extruded outsides by about 1 5 km in 2012 fig 4f after which the whole began to withdraw continuously by a magnitude up to 3 1 km with a concave formation in the middle during the period of 2012 2021 fig 4g i after formation the 5 m contour of the jiangya shoal had a macroscopic change with its barycenter moving downstream and the protrusion separated from the original accumulation and pushed longitudinally by a distance of 33 km fig 4b i such a progress finally built a compound channel configuration from the single one with the north elongated ditch cutting off the jiuduan shoal as for the edge of the jiuduan shoal area increased a lot during 1959 1997 fig 4a and then the contour entered an adjustment in the period of 1997 2021 when the tip of the tail was shaped fig 4d and a dent was dug out in progress fig 4g i 3 2 2 variation in channel shoal volumes the whole sp was silted up with the mean depth decreased from 6 4 m to 4 9 m during 1959 1997 after which it was deepened at a rate of 0 03 m yr and the mean depth was back to 5 8 m fig 5 a furtherly volume between 0 m and 5 m termed as zone of shoal experienced considerable decline by a magnitude of 1 5 108 m3 during 1959 1997 and then rises by little after 1997 fig 5b meanwhile volume below 5 m termed as zone of channel decreased by more than 2 5 108 m3 from 1959 to 1979 and kept stable during 1979 1997 with a fairly low level of growth and subsequently increased at a rate of about 1 0 107 m3 yr fig 5c overall the volumes in different vertical ranges had different variation curves with the asynchrony presented in the volumes change of shoal and channel i e scouring in channel earlier than shoal dramatic alteration was visible on various timescales over the past decades during 1959 to 1979 the sp was silted up rapidly at a net rate of 1 6 107 m3 yr with deposition rate eight times more than erosion fig 6 a b followed by which was a moderate net accretion by 5 5 106 m3 yr in the subsequent period of 1979 1997 and was then scoured by 1 1 107 m3 yr within the recent 25 years fig 6a b this bi decadal change indicates the sedimentary transition process of the sp which was altered from rapid deposition into dramatic erosion moreover in the recent 25 years at scale of 3 years presence of net erosion was significant at least by 8 0 106 m3 yr apart from the minuscule net deposition in the period of 2000 2003 and 2006 2009 fig 6c d furthermore it s obvious that an even greater rate of scouring was growing from 2015 fig 6c d no doubt that the trend reversals of the deposition erosion process became intensified in the past two decades 3 2 3 pattern of the deposition erosion process according to the eof of the dems the major modes of the morphological change in time and space after 1997 were obtained the eof result showed that the variation in bathymetric data during 1997 2021 were mainly contributed by the first two eigenmodes which cover 75 of the explanatory variance proportion fig 7 with each of the remaining modes lower than 10 hence the first two modes represent the dominant patterns of morphological variation in the sp while the others of small standardized variance are negligible emery and thomson 2001 dai et al 2016 the first mode accounts for 61 fig 7a in which the contour surface shows markedly extreme positive or negative values along the channel in the upper and central part and smaller values distributed in the estuary mouth zones of the positive values denoting the deposition mainly coincide with the area of higher depth while the negative ones i e eroding ones overlap with lower fig 1c fig 7a which indicates deposition in the jiangya shoal and deepening in the channel that s to say seaward elongation of both the compound channel and the tail of jiangya shoal dominates the evolution progress in the past 25 years consistent with the channel contour evolution fig 4 curve of the temporal coefficients shows a near linear growth trend fig 7b which is positively correlated well r 0 93 p 0 01 to the volume below 5 m fig 7c meaning deep channel deepening was the dominant explanation of the deposition erosion process within recent 25 years in the sp the second eigenmode takes up 14 of the variance magnitude of the eigenvector is not so great as the first mode with smaller plaques signifying slight deposition or erosion across the main upper channel fig 7d odd stripes with positive and negative values are distributed in the middle of the sp which is likely to coincide with the diversion engineering fig 1c fig 7d the evident positive values concentrated around the lower mouth suggest deposition occurred near the nanhui shoal fig 7d the temporal curve of this mode shows an inverted u shape representing ups during 1998 2007 flats during 2007 2010 and downs during 2010 2019 fig 7d notably a drop from 1997 to 1998 and a period of stabilization during 2019 2021 are presented which correspond with two deluge events in 1998 and 2020 the curve shares negative correlation r 0 67 p 0 01 with the volume within 0 5 m fig 7f indicating the transition in the evolution process of the shoal where accretion firstly happened and then slight scour began to emerge following the brief stagnation during 2007 2010 in general the second mode may suggest partial morphodynamic adjustment induced by episodic event such as engineering and extreme hydrological story which was mainly presented on deposition erosion shift of shoal zones in sp within the period 4 discussion 4 1 the impacts of reservoirs along the changjiang river similar to other deltas through the world syvitski et al 2009 nienhuis et al 2020 the sp was suffering alteration from human interventions at distal sides in the period of 1960s and 1970s several reservoirs were constructed in the upper reaches of the changjiang river which may be the reason causing the slight decline of the ssd exported to the river mouth dai 2021 during 1980s the completion of the gezhouba dam ushered the era of dams architecting on the stem stream of changjiang river dai 2021 making more severe reduction of the sediment load in the lower watershed fig 2d f with the construction of the tgd at the middle of changjiang river since 2003 the sediment reduction has been further deteriorated in spite of stabilization in the water discharge fig 2 the explanation of such a hydrological effect by dams is that sediment can be settled when the flow is mitigated or even blocked but cannot be entrained while the regulated flow is freed again yang et al 2011 dai et al 2018 correlation analysis was used to find out the relationship between upstream hydrological environment and the morphology of the sp under the intensified dam construction it shows that the volume of 0 5 m shares a positive correlation r 0 44 p 0 05 with the water discharge fig 9a meaning that the higher water discharge is corresponding the erosion at the shoal besides a negative correlation r 0 63 p 0 01 is between the sediment flux and the volume below 5 m fig 9d which implies that infilling of the channel is sensitive to the fluvial sediment supply however the subtidal volume within 0 5 m or below 5 m is not correlated to the ssd or the water discharge respectively fig 9b c furthermore by comparison the impact by the tgd on channel is much greater than on shoal shown as increased channel capacity and little change of shoal in the post tgd period fig 9a d this mechanism could provide explanation for the significantly distinct distribution of the dominant mode of eof results that the channel was sharply deepened fig 8 a for the dramatic reduction in fluvial sediment discharge the local ssc of sp also experienced dramatic reduction during recent 20 years responding to the human induced decline of sediment load fig 3e h even so the transition of the ssc showed spatial discrepancies which was manifested as the more sensitive and faster response to sediment starvation at the inner channel than the outer fig 3e h it s probably because of that marine sediment resuspension and the formation of the estuary turbidity maximum zone etm cushioned the effects of the decreasing sediment import swenson et al 2005 song and wang 2013 yang et al 2014 burchard et al 2018 leonardi et al 2021 moreover the outside subaqueous delta of the cjd has been faced with risks luo et al 2017 yang et al 2017 and phenomenon of recession yang et al 2011 wang et al 2020 which would be then served as a sediment source under the entrainment by tidal pumping yang et al 2006 zhu et al 2016 luan et al 2018 however despite the ebb dominant flow during a spring tidal cycle the net seaward flux was dampened from the beginning of this century to the present fig 3d g implying the potentially enhancing influence by flood stream that s to say with the reduction of terrestrial sediment marine dynamics could have a certain resisting effect to decline in local ssc zhang et al 2018 and this effect was greater the closer to the river mouth which could explain the high positive zone in the channel mouth of the second eof mode fig 7d in the context of sediment decline from upstream despite extensive erosion was reported in the whole cjd yang et al 2017 guo et al 2021 discrepancies could be found when talking about the specific evolution in different outlets in distinction to the sp the northernmost outlet north branch has experienced overall siltation over the past few decades for flood dominance and meandering course dai et al 2016 zhang et al 2022 besides analogous changing tendency with the sp were reported in the north channel and north passage with erosion in channel and deposition in shoal jiang et al 2012 mei et al 2018 zheng et al 2021 teng et al 2021 thereafter commonalities exist between these outlets despite under various local anthropogenic regulations which will be discussed in the following sections 4 2 the influence of waterway projects in the sp apart from the upstream reservoirs and dams the nearby engineering also affected the hydro morphology of the sp the famous deep waterway project dwp though built around the north passage has exerted great impact on the water discharge configuration of the sp with the fish mouth like dike for diversion and the south jetties finished between 1998 and 2000 fig 1c fig 9 a since 2000 the flow diversion of the sp has climbed up with the ebb tide ratio decreasing from 39 to 58 and the flood tide ratio from 51 to 70 fig 9a both making the sp a potential dominant waterway such an alteration has remade the tidal current system and influenced the morphology which is similar to the analogous researches jiang et al 2012 dai et al 2013 further the flow diversion ratio of the sp is positively correlated to the volume below 5 m whether it s during flood tide r 0 66 p 0 01 or ebb tide r 0 63 p 0 01 fig 9c e implying that the intensified ebb and flood flow proportion corresponds with bigger volumes i e erosion in deep channel however the distributary proportion seems not so relative with the volume of the shoal fig 9b d saying the shoal channel discrepancy in response to the artificial diversion regulation under stable fluvial water discharge the increased diversion ratio means the amplification of the import water volume this could enhance the reciprocating motion of the tidal current and strengthen the scouring of the river bed which may be the local dynamic force for the first eof mode fig 7a confirmed by the positive correlation between the flow ratios and volume below 5 m fig 9c e moreover after 2013 the navigation regulation project nrp began to be carried on in the sp and embankment was constructed to stabilize the south side of jiangya shoal in 2018 figs 1c 9a which would cause more variations of tidal current and subtidal water volumes it s obvious that the location of the dike and embankment coincides with the line of demarcation between positive and negative values in the second eof mode meaning that the former probably contributes to the latter fig 7d furthermore prophase movement of the avulsed deposit jiangya shoal disturbed the current field and changed the orientation northerly by more than 10 around 2007 fig 3d g which would rebound to the sediment transport regime and eventually pushed the deposit to move northward fig 4e f indicating the mutual influence between dynamics and morphology this interaction was regulated after the upper embankment of the jiangya shoal in 2018 validated in the stable currents of period between 2018 and 2019 which also enhance the compound channel configuration of the sp fig 3d g another effect brought by the waterway projects is dredging directly influencing the morphology during 2013 2014 and 2018 2020 the major section of the mouth bar was dredging for navigation fig 1c which may be the reason that the 5 m isobath was elongated at the lower part fig 4g i however although deeper channel tends to bear more powerful hydrodynamics the source sink and movement of sediment in the deltaic channels are still unpredictable under the dredging projects in the north branch dredging has prompted the overall siltation into erosion accretion balanced state recently luo et al 2017 zhang et al 2022 whereas continuous erosion in channel of the north channel and north passage caused by sand digging activities despite occasional siltation dai et al 2013 mei et al 2018 zheng et al 2021 the uncertain effects under dredging activities were also found in other waterways worldwide van maren et al 2015 ralston et al 2019 therefore how the morphology changes in the sp after the dredging projects remains uncertain and needs longer observation 4 3 the impacts of silting promotion and reclamation projects around the sp in the context of once sufficient sediment supply shoals in the cjd have experienced rapid expansion for a long time especially with the reclamation and silting promotion projects dai 2021 at the nanhui shoal on the south of the sp successive reclamation activities were conducted after 1950s which was shown that 53 km2 had reclaimed from 1958 to 1989 wei et al 2019 more extensive silting promotion projects have begun or are under way since 1994 which would eventually create reclaimed land with an acreage of 288 km2 fig 10 table 1 the edge line of the nanhui shoal has moved northeastward increasingly by about 2 8 km at the middle sp and 12 5 km at the out sp fig 4 fig 10 while the contour of channel is widened shoreward recently fig 4 thus it can be inferred that higher shoals have been piled up within the 5 m contour and the potential area for reclamation is shrinking yang et al 2017 wei et al 2019 what s worse the stepwise formation of the steep slope between shoal and channel would increase the risk of bank erosion threatening the littoral defense predictably with the processing of silting promotion reclamation and navigation development the increase of the surface slope will be a major challenge for the maintenance of shoal channel balance in the sp siltation and reclamation activities were also conducted around the other deltaic channels of cjd such as the engineering on hengsha shoal in recent years which silted up the lower reach of north channel and north passage jiang et al 2012 mei et al 2018 besides reclamation was revealed to contend with the dredging achieving the erosion deposition volume balance in the north branch zhang et al 2022 which could be a favorable action for making sustainable development however when taking a broader view inevitable recession crisis is imminent that the subaqueous delta was proved to be severely eroded under the dual pressure from coastal reclamation and sediment decline luo et al 2017 yang et al 2017 luan et al 2018 hence more works are being demanded to address the contradiction from all the different human activities mentioned above including distal and proximal side temporary sources and sinks 4 4 the alteration brought by sea level change sea level rise widely regarded as an issue with anthropogenic impact apparently influences the hydrodynamics and morphology of the cjd cheng et al 2018 lou et al 2022 rate of the sea level rise at the inner sp is about 0 75 cm yr 0 22 cm yr larger than that of the long term tidal gauge station fig 11 lvsi station which could represent the sea level outside the mouth of the cjd feng et al 2021 the increment should be due to fluvial water discharge and squeezing by the channel narrowing kuang et al 2017 cheng et al 2018 results of correlation analysis suggests that the water level is positively correlated to both the volumes of shoal r 0 56 p 0 01 and channel r 0 86 p 0 01 fig 12 a b during the recent 20 years implying that the rising sea level caused erosion in the whole sp and the channel is more sensitive than the shoal corresponding with the polarized evolutionary characteristics of the first eof mode furthermore in spite of the significant positive correlation the rate of the sea level rise was less than a quarter of 3 cm yr rate of the mean depth increasing fig 5a inferred from which the ascending sea level not only acted on the morphological change through direct inundation but probably also served as a reinforcement factor on the tidal dynamics thus on the morphology nienhuis et al 2018 leuven et al 2019 minderhoud et al 2019 yuan et al 2020 in addition it s reported that the tidal range which can be used to measure the strength of regional coastal tide had mutual nonlinear interaction with the sea level in coastal and estuarine areas wang and townend 2012 kirwan and megonigal 2013 leuven et al 2019 devlin et al 2017 lee et al 2017 here a slight positive correlation exits r 0 39 p 0 1 in the relevance between the tidal range and the volume of 0 5 m fig 12c demonstrating that the annual changing tidal range probably scours the shoal in the sp the reason is mostly that the symbiotic ups and downs of sea level and tidal range fig 3b kept shallow submerged zones accumulated through extending the period of inundation and slack stream whereas the deeper zones suffered intensified shear stress for the higher water content consistence with many former researches kirwan et al 2016 leuven et al 2019 cai et al 2022 wang et al 2022 4 5 schematic map on the evolution of the sp during 1959 2021 the sp had suffered dramatic alterations from progressively intensified anthropogenic exploitation and presented complicated evolutionary process spatially and temporally fig 12 any engineering has its instantaneous and persistent influence so cumulative effect of each relevant project and overlap effect since the engineering nodes were illustrated generally considering the riverine sediment transfer and density of the human activities and the consequent morphodynamics three main stages were demonstrated which are rapid accretion during 1959 1979 moderate accretion during 1979 1997 dramatic erosion during 1997 2021 fig 13 from 1959 to 1979 the sp was primarily affected by natural forces with little human interference and was silted up at high rate after 1981 fluvial retention by reservoirs and dams along the river watershed reduced the seaward ssd by about 17 fig 2d and subsequently slowed down the accretion rate by 60 fig 5a the turning point from deposition to erosion is in 1997 or even earlier for data blank since which large estuarine engineering and land reclamation projects have been carried out making the morphodynamics more complicated further the completion of tgd resulted in a greater amount of sediment reduction by over 70 of the first phase triggering more severe erosion over recent two decades coupled with the sea level rise hence in conclusion the deposition and erosion process of sp has stepped into an epoch dominated by intensive anthropogenic forces the spatial reshaping process shows more complication than bulk sedimentation especially in the past 25 years notably differentiation is found between shoal and channel against the deposition erosion switch i e shoal more prone to siltation and channel to erosion which accounts for the largest morphodynamic mode of the sp figs 5 7a 13 that may be because estuarine densified water current is inclined to form a stratified structure and channel shoal shear front blocking sedimentation in the deep channel burchard et al 2018 therefore the aggradation of jiuduan shoal jiangya shoal and nanhui shoal was visible despite the ongoing sediment starvation and sea level rise fig s1 however although keeping the seaward expansion of the nanhui shoal the multiple reclamation projects were reducing the possibility of shoal s dilation and breaking the balance between shoal and channel with the formation of abrupt slope figs s1 13 besides embankment of the south jiangya shoal built in 2018 hampers sediment exchange between the inner channel and shoal and may intensify the dynamics mentioned above fig s1 since the time is too short to determinate the variation quantitatively longer period of observation is required for further research setting aside this limitation more attention is suggested to concentrate on defending potential erosion risks caused by sediment transfer when developing the reclaimed land in addition to determine the favorable locations for dredged soil should be helpful in keeping the shoal channel balance and sustainable development with dredging becoming a main management approach in the present and foreseeable future 5 conclusion long term hydro morphodynamics of the channels in river deltas is widely concerned in the context of the human induced sediment reduction sea level rise and intensive intervention caused by estuarine engineering by analyzing the long term series of hydrological and morphological data with high resolution we investigated the deposition erosion process of the sp in the cjd under compound factors over the past 60 years the main conclusions are as follows 1 during 1959 2020 riverine sediment exported to the cjd has experienced dramatic decline which promoted the morphodynamics of the sp from high accretion to sharp erosion in the context of the dam retention the ssd is found to decrease by over 70 since 1959 which probably cut down the local ssc of the sp by about 50 this process of sediment transfer both distally and proximally corresponded with the three evolution phases in the sp rapid accretion 1959 1979 moderate deposition 1979 1997 and dramatic erosion 1997 2021 2 the three deposition erosion phases contain exclusive landscape characteristics at the first and second phase formation and movement of the jiangya shoal and narrowing of the upper channel were the main rhythms accompanied with enormous deposition at rate of 1 6 107 m3 yr and 5 5 106 m3 yr respectively at the third phase with highly scouring by 1 1 107 m3 yr channel was deepened and elongated while shoal extended seaward as well significantly asynchronous performances were found between zones of shoal and channel within the morphodynamic process of sp manifested as channel suffered rapid erosion even faster than the shoal with the latter maintain a deposition or minor erosion state 3 to further explore the recent erosion phase in depth evolutionary pattern was revealed by the eof method results showed the first mode accounted for 61 of the total variance and suggested a near linear continuous erosion of channel dominated the morphological alteration over the past 25 years under the huge sediment reduction rising sea level and increasing flow diversion the second mode taking up 14 shifted from increasing state into decreasing around 2010 which mainly describes overall transition from deposition to erosion of shoal zone and explains adjustment to episodic events enhanced flood force and local engineering constructions such a discrepancy would also be accentuated by the dredging on channel and reclamation on tidal flat or even subtidal shoal which reduced the subaqueous shallow space

1789,quantifying the propagation time pt and trigger threshold tr from meteorological to soil moisture drought is critically important for drought early warning and precise defense nevertheless existing propagation characteristics usually have a low temporal spatial resolution and their dynamics and related driving mechanisms such as global warming and greening are still incompletely understood to fill the knowledge gap this study proposes a drought propagation model based on the bayesian causal analysis framework for quantifying the pt and tr with a high resolution taking northeast china nec as a case study we further explore the dynamics of drought propagation characteristics in recent decades and possible driving mechanisms using the sliding window and random forest model results showed that 1 the drought pt varies spatially and temporally in the study area with long pt in the central plain and western high altitude areas in the early growing season typically over 200 days while short in the middle and late growing season in most regions less than one month in july and august the tr is generally lower than 80 mm in the western regions and do not change significantly with time 2 the pt and tr in the vast central and western regions exhibit a downward trend in the late growing season resulting in a strikingly increased risk of drought propagation 3 increasing vapor pressure deficit vpd due to warming along with decreasing aridity index ai due to precipitation shortage are the main drivers on the accelerated drought propagation moreover local greening has also played a critical role in accelerating propagation via transpiration that consumes soil water which contributes more than 20 to propagation dynamics overall this study sheds new insights into drought propagation dynamics and mechanisms in a changing environment providing a promising avenue for drought early warning and mitigation keywords meteorological drought soil moisture drought propagation time and trigger threshold propagation dynamics and mechanism warming and greening drought early warning data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction drought is an extreme water shortage phenomenon in the process of terrestrial hydrological cycle which is usually hidden and difficult to forecast in advance mishra and singh 2011 in many cases drought can be hardly realized until it has caused considerable losses to the ecological environment agricultural production and social economy chen et al 2022a mahecha et al 2022 yao et al 2022 zhao and wang 2021 according to the affected objects drought is generally classified into four categories meteorological drought i e rainfall deficit agricultural drought i e soil moisture deficit hydrological drought i e abnormal reduction of river streamflow and socio economic drought i e imbalance of water supply and demand affecting economic development zhang et al 2022b typically in nature different types of drought rarely occur in isolation in the hydrological cycle and their causative relationships are often entwined van loon 2015 zhang et al 2022b drought signal generally starts from the abnormal decrease of precipitation mishra and singh 2010 for example with the precipitation deficit persists soil moisture stored in the early stage will be continuously dissipated by evapotranspiration then the soil moisture drought may be triggered if the precipitation cannot be replenished in time the drought signal may continue to propagate downward along the hydrological cycle and eventually resulting in hydrological drought or even groundwater drought kumar et al 2016 tijdeman et al 2022 vicente serrano et al 2020 the process of drought signals transmitting along the hydrological cycle is known as drought propagation apurv et al 2017 zhang et al 2021a developing a holistic understanding of the propagation process of drought signals in the hydrological cycle system can reveal the formation principle of drought and provide a new path for drought early warning li et al 2022b in general meteorological drought is the precursor of other types of droughts but the shortage of precipitation usually does not lead to other drought types immediately there are obvious time accumulation and threshold effects in the evolution of drought taking meteorological to soil moisture drought as an example the drought signal needs to continue for a period of time after the onset of meteorological drought to accumulate the shortage of precipitation when this precipitation deficiency beyond a certain threshold it may lead to a decrease in soil moisture thereby triggering soil moisture drought the time and threshold effects in the process of drought development are generally defined as drought propagation time pt and triggering threshold tr tijdeman et al 2022 wu et al 2021b having advance knowledge of the drought propagation characteristics pt and tr in a particular region is crucial for local water resource managers to timely understand the development status and severity of drought estimate the amount of water resources required to alleviate it and determine when to take appropriate measures han et al 2021b these key pieces of information are vital for early warning and risk management of drought in recent years the propagation between different types of droughts has received increasing attention in the hydrological community apurv et al 2017 zhang et al 2021b earlier studies on the drought propagation commonly employed a relatively simple correlation coefficient method to identify and analyze the general relationship between different drought types barker et al 2016 huang et al 2017 lópez moreno et al 2013 for example the pt of meteorological drought to hydrological drought can be determined by using the cumulative scales of the standardized precipitation index spi that corresponds to the maximum correlation coefficient between different cumulative scales of spi and the standardized streamflow index ssi huang et al 2017 in subsequent studies the run theory was usually used to extract drought events in drought index series and then identified the propagation process between droughts by matching different types of drought events bevacqua et al 2021 wu et al 2018 however the data length can limit the number of drought events that may be finally matched recently some studies employed probability based methods to estimate the probability of soil moisture drought caused by meteorological drought and further analyzed the relationship between different types of droughts xu et al 2021 zhang et al 2021c zhu et al 2021 additionally hydrological models have also been used to investigate the propagation of droughts at the basin scale such methods have a sound physical basis zhang et al 2021a and can simulate the changes in hydrological variables for analyzing how drought signals propagate in spite of these the models often involve many parameters to be estimated and may suffer from the equifinality issue for different parameters which complicates their usage furthermore the quality and length of data in many regions are often insufficient to meet the requirement of the models which also hinders their practical applications konapala and mishra 2020 melsen and guse 2019 zhang et al 2022b these studies have provided valuable insights that improved our understanding of drought propagation processes in the hydrological cycle and the formation mechanism of drought disasters but the research on drought propagation is still in the initial stage in the process of drought propagation pt and tr are two important characteristics determining whether or not the drought signal propagates downward and as well as the key parameters for early warning and drought prevention guo et al 2020 however most of the current studies focus on the calculation and analysis of the pt between different droughts while the drought tr which indicates the precipitation deficit required for drought signal transmission remains unclear in addition most of the current research investigated drought propagation processes only at the seasonal scale however quantitative studies for the months of the growing season are rare and the unit of the pt is typically measured on a monthly scale so the temporal resolution needs to be improved to meet the application requirements li et al 2022b furthermore it is remains unclear whether the fluctuation of regional water and energy conditions in a warming climate will change the drought propagation process especially in the cold regions of higher latitudes peng et al 2019 as a component of the terrestrial ecosystem vegetation plays a significant role in the water and energy exchange between land and atmosphere bonan 2008 cheng et al 2022 seneviratne et al 2010 and is a bridge to connect and regulate the soil moisture atmosphere feedback process li et al 2018 zhao et al 2022 therefore it will be necessary to investigate whether the dynamic change of vegetation especially in the greening regions will exacerbate the propagation of drought signals between meteorology and soil moisture guo et al 2023 in the absence of studies addressing these topics the driving mechanisms of drought propagation under changing environments remain largely unknown northeast china nec is the main production base of corn soybean and animal husbandry in china which has an important impact on food security in china and even the world wan et al 2022 in addition nec is also rich in forest resources it is one of the major carbon sink areas in china and has important ecological functions ge et al 2022 however under the background of global warming due to the relatively high latitude of nec the temperature in this region has risen significantly in recent decades zhang et al 2022a and the drought has shown an increasing trend guo et al 2017 zhao et al 2020 this will bring unprecedented challenges to agricultural production and ecological environment protection in nec li et al 2022a to sum up in order to effectively warn against soil moisture drought this study attempts to address the following three scientific questions 1 how to effectively estimate the temporal and spatial distribution of drought pt and tr throughout the growing season 2 how pt and tr respond to the warming and greening contexts 3 which factors dominate the drought propagation dynamics and what the propagation mechanisms that drive drought signals are taking nec as the study area the study used the spi and standardized soil moisture index ssmi to characterize meteorological and soil moisture drought respectively based on the proposed drought propagation evaluation framework five cupula functions were utilized to establish the connection between precipitation and soil moisture and the pt and tr required for soil moisture drought at various grades were extracted with a ten days resolution we further investigated the dynamic trend of drought propagation characteristics using a sliding window and the important influencing factors were determined by using a random forest model finally the driving mechanisms behind of drought propagation processes under changing environment were analyzed overall this study is expected to provide a scientific basis for drought early warning and drought disaster management the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 2 will introduce the overview of the study area and show the basic information of the data used and section 3 will explain the principle and procedure of the method used in this study then section 4 will show and analyze the results obtained section 5 is the discussion part and finally the main conclusions of this paper will be given in section 6 2 study area and data 2 1 study area northeast china nec is located in the northeast of the eurasian continent 115 52 135 09 e 38 40 53 56 it covers four provinces and cities with a total area of about 1 25 million km2 topographically nec features a plain surrounded by mountains on its three sides in the middle of the study area is the northeast great plain which consists of sanjiang plain songnen plain and liaohe plain the great plain is surrounded by the greater khingan mountains in the west the lesser khingan mountains in the north and the changbai mountains in the east fig 1 a the nec has a temperate continental monsoon climate which is warm and rainy in summer and cold and long in winter from south to north it crosses the middle temperate zone and the sub frigid zone where the annual average temperature drops from 11 7 c to 5 c from east to west the nec crosses semi humid semiarid and arid areas with the annual total precipitation gradually declining from 1000 mm to less than 200 mm fig 1 b as the third largest black soil belt in the world the northeast great plain is rich in organic matter with the total grain output accounting for more than 1 5 of the country wan et al 2022 in addition the mountains surrounding the plain are the largest distribution area of natural forests in china fig 1 c ge et al 2022 the high forest coverage can prolong ice and snow melting which boosts local agriculture and forestry due to the forest snow storage however climate change has considerably increased the temperature zhang et al 2022a and exacerbated drought in nec over the recent decades guo et al 2017 zhao et al 2020 which is extremely unfavorable for rainfed agriculture in the region 2 2 dataset this study mainly used the long time series of precipitation and soil moisture data from 1962 to 2014 to establish the relationship between meteorological drought and soil moisture drought the daily gridded precipitation is from the china national meteorological information center http www cma gov cn 2011qxfw 2011qsjgx which was produced by 2472 national meteorological observation stations by spatial interpolation with a resolution of 0 5 0 5 this dataset has been widely verified as reliable and extensively used in the monitoring and evaluation of regional drought fang et al 2019 monthly soil moisture data were derived from global land data assistance system version 2 gldas 2 0 https disc gsfc nasa gov with a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 this dataset has been verified in many regions of china as well providing reliable soil moisture data for agricultural drought research wang et al 2016 zhang et al 2017b in addition the potential evapotranspiration pet and vapor pressure deficit vpd were calculated using the meteorological variables such as temperature pressure wind speed radiation and relative humidity in the gldas 2 0 dataset 1962 2014 which were likewise widely applied in china han et al 2021a li et al 2022b besides we used the ndvi index 1981 2014 provided by the global inventory monitoring and mapping system gimms ndvi3g https ecocast arc nasa gov data pub gimms 3g v0 to analyze the impact of vegetation cover change on drought evolution in recent decades in this study monthly soil moisture and meteorological data with 0 25 0 25 resolution and monthly ndvi data with 8 km 8 km resolution were upscaled to 0 5 0 5 in order to match the spatial resolution of the precipitation dataset 3 methods fig 2 illustrates the method framework of this paper which consists of five main procedures 1 calculating the standardized meteorological and soil moisture drought index 2 establishing the relationship between soil moisture and precipitation 3 quantifying the pt of soil moisture drought at different magnitudes 4 quantifying the drought tr and 5 driving force analysis of the possible trend in drought propagation characteristics the details of the method framework are explained as follows 3 1 standardized drought indices in recent decades many drought indicators have been proposed among which the standardized drought indices constructed on the template of spi have developed the most rapidly zhang et al 2022b the principle of constructing such indices is to fit specific hydrological variables e g precipitation runoff and soil moisture through appropriate probability distribution functions e g gamma and gaussian distribution after calculating the probability of each hydrological variable value under the target cumulative scale the corresponding drought indices can be finally obtained through standard normalization of the probability values han et al 2021a this approach was first proposed by mckee et al 1993 and compared with traditional drought indicators such as pdsi these indices have variable time scales allowing drought conditions to be evaluated flexibly on monthly seasonal or annual scales in accordance with the needs fang et al 2019 in addition due to the standardized processing the indices are spatiotemporal comparable and the calculation is also relatively straightforward with fewer data requirements because of these advantages drought indices developed with this principle e g spi spei ssmi and ssi have gained widespread use in drought research worldwide bevacqua et al 2021 choudhury et al 2021 kalisa et al 2020 peng et al 2020 zhao et al 2020 the spei is a drought index established based on the water balance of a certain region the difference between potential evapotranspiration and actual precipitation the main advantage of this index is that it can comprehensively consider the meteorological drought development status of a certain region from both precipitation and potential evaporation aspects however the theme of this study is to establish a direct relationship between atmospheric precipitation and soil moisture and further investigate the propagation process of meteorological drought to soil moisture drought in addition the soil moisture drought triggering threshold calculated in this article is also expressed by the degree of actual precipitation deficit therefore in characterizing meteorological drought this article uses the spi index which can directly reflect the surplus or deficit of precipitation while considering potential evapotranspiration as an important driving factor in the drought propagation process then ssmi was used to characterize soil moisture drought a ten days cumulative unit was used as the minimum cumulative unit in calculating the spi index for every month during the growing season i e may to september on the time scale of 1 36 ten days by establishing the relationship between spi at different cumulative scales and ssmi at monthly scales the propagation characteristics from meteorological drought to soil moisture drought are further estimated see section 3 2 here the calculation steps of spi and ssmi will be skipped which can be referred to han et al 2021a li et al 2022b for more details the grading criteria for standardized drought indices are shown in table 1 after obtaining the standardized drought indices in order to the preparation for the next step to establishing the joint distribution between precipitation and soil moisture we calculated the pearson correlation coefficients between the spi and ssmi in respective scales eq 1 to analyze the spatial and temporal distribution of the dependence of soil moisture on the precipitation series at different scales 1 r ij c o r r sp i ij s s m i j where i denotes the cumulative scale of spi i 1 2 36 ten days j denotes the month in the growing season from may to september and rij is the pearson correlation coefficient between the monthly scale ssmi series in month j and spi series with accumulated scale of i ten days 3 2 quantification of drought propagation time and trigger threshold 3 2 1 constructing joint distribution based on the copula theory how to construct a multidimensional joint distribution is the premise and core of studying the interdependent structure of hydrological variables traditionally the joint distribution functions were built through multidimensional probability distributions e g multidimensional gaussian distribution or exponential distribution however the approach generally demands specific distributions for the marginal distribution of variables which greatly limits its applicability the proposal and improvement of copula function provide a new solution to the above problem fang et al 2019 wu et al 2021a basically the copula function is used to describe the multidimensional correlation structure which connects the marginal distribution functions due to unrestricted forms of marginal distribution as well as the flexibility and diversity of copula function this approach has been widely used in the hydrological community to analyze the relationship between different hydrometeorological variables fang et al 2019 wu et al 2021a zhao et al 2020 in this study five two dimensional copula functions commonly used in the field of hydrology see table 2 were selected to establish the joint distribution of monthly ssmi and spi at different time scales regardless of which copular function is used the joint distribution f sp i i s s m i of spi and ssmi series is calculated as follows 2 f sp i i s s m i spi s s m i p sp i i s p i s s m i s s m i c f sp i i spi f ssmi ssmi where f sp i i and f ssmi represent the marginal distribution functions of spi and ssmi sequences respectively i denotes the cumulative scale of spi and its value is 1to36 ten days c is the one of the five copula functions in this study the optimal copula function for each grid was determined by the least squared euclidean distance sed 3 2 2 identification of the drought propagation time the drought pt was determined by the conditional probability of meteorological drought leading to soil moisture drought which was calculated by a bayesian causal analysis framework the specific procedures are as follows 1 firstly the conditional probability of meteorological drought leading to different grades of soil moisture drought under different time scales is calculated as follows 3 p i j p ssm i j d s s p i ji d s p s s m i j d s s p i ji d s p sp i ji d s c f ssm i j ds f sp i ji ds f sp i i ds where ds denote different drought grades the values are 0 5 1 and 1 5 represent mild moderate and severe soil moisture drought scenarios respectively p ji indicates the probability of soil moisture drought above ds grade caused by meteorological drought with a cumulative scale of i ten days in month j c represents the joint distribution function using the optimal copula function 2 based on the probability value p ji calculated by eq 3 the drought propagation probability matrix pm as follows 4 p m p 1 36 p 2 36 p 3 36 p 4 36 p 5 36 p 1 2 p 2 2 p 3 2 p 4 2 p 5 2 p 1 1 p 2 1 p 3 1 p 4 1 p 5 1 where each row of the matrix represents the probability of causing soil moisture drought at one of the 36 ten days accumulation scales and each column represents one of the five months in the growing season i e from may to september fig 3 schematically illustrates the calculation of the probability matrix then a probability threshold pi is selected to determine the pt from the probability matrix if the matrix contains a probability greater than the threshold the meteorological drought cumulative scale i that first reaches the threshold will be regarded as the pt from meteorological drought to soil moisture drought pt i here the threshold is configured as 0 6 and the details will be discussed in section 5 2 3 2 3 quantifying drought trigger threshold based on obtaining the pt tr i e the total amount of precipitation deficit required to trigger soil moisture drought within the duration of a continued water shortage period of pt can be further identified the basic idea for quantifying tr is to first establish the joint distribution between the soil moisture series of each month and the accumulated precipitation series under the corresponding pt then using conditional probability formula eq 5 calculate the probability of soil moisture drought occurrence under different levels of precipitation deficits and finally select the tr for drought propagation based on this probability the specific procedures are as follows firstly the probability of soil moisture drought caused by different precipitation intervals under the pt accumulation scale is calculated with following equation 5 p j p s m j s m p r 1 p r j p t p r p s m j s m p r 1 p r j p t p r p p r 1 p r j p t p r p s m j s m p r j p t p r p s m j s m p r j p t p r 1 p p r j p t p r p p

within the duration range of pt s m j represents the status of soil moisture in month j sm refers to the soil moisture content corresponding to the occurrence of drought at the ds grade pr is a looping variable whose initial value represents the total precipitation amount accumulated within the pt time range corresponding to the occurrence of meteorological drought at the ds grade p j refers to the probability of triggering soil moisture drought under the state range of precipitation total within pr 1 pr next the precipitation interval pr 1 pr will be iteratively reduced by a step of 1 mm and eq 5 will be used to calculate the probability values of soil moisture drought caused under different precipitation intervals when the probability value exceeds the preset threshold of 0 8 to ensure that tr has higher reliability we set a probability threshold higher than that of pt the iteration is stopped at this point tr is equal to the difference between the multi year average precipitation in the pt time range and the pr value at the end of the iteration tr pr p r where pr is the multi year average precipitation in other words tr represents the total precipitation deficit relative to normal state that is required to trigger soil moisture drought and its unit is millimeters 3 3 exploring drought propagation dynamics and possible drivers in order to identify the dynamic trend of the propagation characteristics in the changing environments we segmented the original data using a sliding window with a length of 31 years and then calculated each window independently by the method described in section 3 2 to determine how drought pt and tr have changed over recent decades to test the significance of the trend the mann kendall trend test method mk with a significance level of 0 05 was used burn and hag elnur 2002 this study used random forest model to evaluate the importance of different predictors for identifying possible drivers of the trend in propagation characteristics the random forest model is one of machine learning algorithms which was first proposed by breiman 2001 and has been widely used to solve classification and regression problems giri et al 2023 rosecrans et al 2022 the model is essentially a classifier with multiple decision trees its operation step is to first use the bootstrap resampling method to randomly extract multiple samples from the original data then train and fit each bootstrap sample to build a regression tree and finally the final result is obtained by averaging with the prediction results of all regression trees jing et al 2020 xie et al 2021 it is a nonlinear modeling tool that has a reliable result for solving multivariate prediction problems and has a good tolerance to outliers and noise chagas et al 2016 guo et al 2015 zhang et al 2017a in this study we established a random forest model consisting of 500 regression trees the cart method was used to split the decision tree and the minimum terminal node size was defined as 5 then we used the permutation importance method to rank the importance of each influencing variable the specific approach is to randomly shuffle the normal time sequence of the detection variables and re inputting the broken variables into the model for calculation the importance of the variables is evaluated based on the degree of decrease in model prediction accuracy with greater decreases indicating a larger impact of the variable on the dependent variable pham and brabyn 2017 we use the random forest model to rank the importance of the main driving factors such as aridity index ai precipitation change p vapor pressure deficit vpd and normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and to identify the dominant factors that affect the drought propagation characteristics for more details about the random forest algorithm can refer to the literature huang et al 2022 xie et al 2021 in addition the introduction and calculation method of ai and vpd are shown in appendix s1 4 results 4 1 dependence of soil moisture on precipitation in growing season before establishing the joint distribution between soil moisture and precipitation in the study area the correlation of soil moisture and precipitation at different cumulative scales was analyzed as shown in fig 4 a the maximum correlation coefficient between spi and ssmi series was selected to draw the spatial temporal distribution diagram in general the soil moisture and precipitation showed a positive correlation in each month of the growing season from the time perspective the correlation in the early growing season i e may to june is slightly lower than in the middle and late periods i e july to september this difference is probably associated with the snow cover and frozen soil melting that weaken the link between soil water and precipitation during the early growing season chen et al 2022b wang et al 2015 from the perspective of spatial distribution the correlation is relatively high in the western part of the nec while lower in the central region for the western part the lack of rains making a strong link between soil moisture and precipitation in contrast the central region occupies mostly low lying alluvial plains where farmland wetlands and marshes are widely spread the soil moisture content is thus higher than that in other regions with a relatively weak natural connection to precipitation in addition the optimal response time of the soil moisture to the precipitation i e spi accumulation time corresponding to the maximum correlation coefficient is shown in fig 4 b in the early stage of the growing season the response time is longer and gradually shortens as the month progresses during the early growing season when temperature is generally low evaporation and dissipation capacity of soil water are limited and early snowfall and frozen soil dissolution can further replenish soil moisture as a result soil moisture is relatively weakly dependent on precipitation and responds slowly to the possible precipitation deficits at the later stage of the growing season however with the increase in temperature and evapotranspiration the connection between soil moisture and precipitation is strengthened which reduces the response time in general soil moisture in the nec depends heavily on precipitation in the growing season which is the precondition to establishing the joint distribution of soil moisture and precipitation and calculating the drought pt 4 2 propagation time from meteorological to soil moisture drought fig 5 shows the spatiotemporal distribution of drought pt in the study area and fig 8 a summaries the spatial average of drought pt for grids under different drought grades in each month of the growing season in terms of time the pt in the early growing season i e may to june is relatively long generally exceeding 200 days while it shortens in the middle and late growing seasons i e july to september fig 8 a in most regions of the study area the pt in july and august is typically less than 30 days the shortest level of the entire growing season while the pt in september is slightly longer roughly from 40 to 100 days fig 5 as seen from space the pt is longer in the central plain western plateau area and northern high latitude coniferous forest areas than it is elsewhere it is further obvious that the pt required progressively increases as soil moisture droughts worsen fig 8 a the blank part in fig 5 indicates that the probability of soil moisture drought caused by meteorological drought does not exceed the predefined probability threshold i e 0 6 in the case note that with the drought severity increases more grids fail to meet the requirement of probability especially in the central region the above temporal and spatial patterns of the pt are largely related to the water and heat conditions during the growing season as well as the topography and underlying surface conditions when it comes to a mild soil moisture drought for example in the early growing season i e may to june the temperature is relatively low fig 6 a and the evaporation is also weak so the soil water cannot dissipate as readily in addition plant leaves are not fully developed in the early growing season fig 6 d which reduces the demand for soil water and vapor that can pass through stomata hao et al 2021 the relatively high latitude of nec and the long cold winter that resulted in the large amount of snow and frozen soil melting in the western and northern regions can also contribute to soil moisture peng et al 2016 wang et al 2019 xu et al 2022 in light of the above reasons soil moisture loss can be slower during early growing season when precipitation is lacking and soil water can be replenished to some extent resulting in a relatively difficult propagation of signals from the meteorological drought to the soil moisture and thus relatively long pt however even though the precipitation of soil replenishment increased in the summer see fig 6 b as the temperature and solar radiation reached their highest level of the whole growing season soil water evaporation accelerated meanwhile the plant leaves have been fully developed thus the water vapor dissipated by the vegetation has also enhanced zhang and zhang 2019 therefore when the meteorological drought comes the water stored in the soil will be quickly dissipated through the soil surface and foliar under the promotion of high temperature causing the soil moisture drought to occur and the shortest pt in july and august in september the dissipation rate of soil moisture decreased along with the decrease in temperature and vegetation greenness prolonging the drought pt slightly from the perspective of spatial distribution the central northern and western regions of the study area have longer pt than other regions especially in july which may be explained by the terrain and underlying surface conditions in the region the area with a long pt in the central region of the study area is mainly located in the songnen plain which is mainly formed by erosion and alluviation of the songhua river and nenjiang river this region has relatively low terrain a dense river network and a high soil moisture content fig 6 c which makes the connection between soil moisture and precipitation relatively weak it can be seen from the low correlation between soil moisture and precipitation in the central region of fig 4 a consequently meteorological droughts usually take a longer pt to cause soil moisture droughts in the region western and northern parts of the nec on the other hand are located in the inner mongolia plateau and the greater khingan mountains respectively both have high altitudes especially in the western region where the average altitude exceeds 2 000 m fig 2 a the resulting low temperatures may weaken the relationship between soil moisture drought and meteorological drought further the northern region is dominated by coniferous forest fig 2 c as compared to broad leaved forests distributed in other mountains in the study area coniferous forests have smaller leaf areas and weaker transpiration ouyang et al 2021 and their soil water demands are also lower than broad leaved forests as a result of above factors soil moisture consumption rates are relatively low when meteorological drought occurs which may explain the longer pt in both regions furthermore when the soil moisture drought grades grow meteorological droughts often require accumulating for a longer period to cause higher grades in the meanwhile the grid that is capable of reaching the trigger probability will also decrease which is more evident in areas with a weak dependence between soil moisture and precipitation see fig 4 a and fig 5 overall the drought pt in the vast areas of the nec is usually the shortest in july and august in this case soil moisture drought caused by meteorological drought is often less than one month which leaves little time for people to prepare and respond it is therefore extremely unfavorable for early warning of droughts which should be of great concern to water resources managers 4 3 the trigger threshold of meteorological drought driving soil moisture drought fig 7 illustrates the spatial distribution of tr required to trigger different grades of soil moisture drought and fig 8 b shows the regional average of the tr to trigger different grades of soil moisture drought during the growing season in the figures it is clear that tr distribution has remained relatively constant over time while it is lower in the western region than in the central and eastern regions generally below 80 mm which is mainly because of the relatively low precipitation in the western region fig 2 b in addition as soil moisture drought intensify the tr required to trigger soil moisture drought also increases for mild soil moisture droughts a precipitation deficit around 80 mm is needed while moderate and severe droughts require a tr exceeding 120 and 140 mm respectively fig 8 b furthermore the tr has different temporal pattern compared to pt and it does not show an obvious downward trend in the middle and late growing season fig 8 in which case the temporal pattern of precipitation plays a large role the precipitation in nec is mainly concentrated in the middle and late growing seasons summer fig 6 b despite the short pt due to the large amount of precipitation a higher tr can be accumulated rapidly however in the early growth season the precipitation accumulation range when calculating tr is mainly in spring and winter in spite of the long pt in this case the low precipitation limits the total amount of precipitation accumulated so there is no significant difference between tr in the early and late growing seasons note that the tr was calculated by directly analyzing precipitation and soil moisture without standardized processing which made the soil moisture drought states of the regional grid reflected by the tr cannot be directly compared in space it is possible however to combine tr with the drought pt to provide important reference information for the regional drought warning and prevention taking a specific month of the growing season as an example first the time range for detecting precipitation status can be determined in advance according to the drought pt of that month and then the deficit between the current precipitation and the historical average within this cumulative scale can be calculated which can be further compared with the tr in that month if the actual precipitation deficits that exceed the drought tr indicate that a soil moisture drought is likely to occur in that month the water gap needed to block the propagation of drought signal from meteorological to soil moisture drought can be also obtained by subtracting actual precipitation deficits from tr by comparing the water gap with the current available water the severity of soil moisture drought and economic losses can be probably estimated in advance therefore according to the above methods using the pt and tr under different drought grades an early warning system for soil moisture drought in each month of the growing season can be developed to prevent and control drought precisely furthermore more drought information can be obtained by adjusting the extraction probability thresholds of pt and tr details will be elaborated in the discussion section 4 4 the dynamics of drought propagation characteristics in a changing environment in recent studies nec has been presented a significant warming trend zhang et al 2022a a major focus of the study is how the propagation from meteorological drought to soil moisture drought will be affected by the changing environment especially in terms of the pt in this study 31 year sliding windows were used to segment the original data and the pt under each window was calculated to obtain the sequence of dynamic changes in the pt then the mann kendall method was used to test its significance fig 9 shows the dynamic change trend of the drought pt in recent decades a darker red in the figure indicates a more pronounced shortening of pt while blue represents the opposite grids with a dot indicate a significant trend α 0 05 during the early growing season i e may and june the drought pt showed a significant prolonging trend in the whole study area except for a few grids in the western region as of july however the overall prolonging trend of pt started to weaken and the central and eastern regions even showed a significant shortening trend during the late growth season i e august and september the overall dynamics of pt shifted from an early prolonging trend to a significant shortening trend especially in the central and western regions several factors affect the propagation process of drought signals from the atmosphere to the soil moisture system along the hydrological cycle but they can be divided into two basic categories according to the cycle process of soil moisture source and expenditure therefore precipitation p the main source of soil water together with the aridity index ai and vapor pressure deficit vpd which affect soil moisture consumption were selected as the potential drivers of the changing pt their importance was evaluated using a random forest model the importance of different influencing factors to pt in each month of the growing season was evaluated fig 10 shows the spatial distribution of the two factors that have the greatest impacts on the pt obviously pt in most regions in may is mainly affected by vpd and precipitation whereas in june precipitation dominates the north of the study area with vpd dominating the west and southeast in comparison as of july the area with significantly shortened pt was mainly affected by vpd while the area with a prolonging trend is mainly affected by precipitation in the southeast region in august and september the area where the pt is shortened was primarily affected by the vpd and ai in early growing season may and june drought pt is characterized by a prolonged trend the above analysis indicates that vpd might be an important factor but could be also associated with the rising trend in temperature that makes the vpd rise in the study area fig s1 a and d as a result of the high latitude of nec the soil surface still stores more snow and frozen soil in the early growing season chen et al 2022b wang et al 2015 the residual snow and frozen soil in winter and spring supplement soil water can more rapidly in a warming climate which alleviates the soil moisture drought wang et al 2019 furthermore precipitation in most areas also increased fig s1 b which further supplemented soil moisture to reduce the impact of drought therefore although the vpd shows an upward trend in the early growing season the pt is prolonged due to snow melting and increased precipitation as of july the significant shortening trend of pt in the central and eastern regions of the study area was mainly due to an increase in vpd this is because the snow and frozen soil have dissolved at that time and the higher vpd caused by the rising temperature will increase the water demand of the atmosphere fig s1 d which will directly accelerate the actual evaporation consumption from the soil in the southeast region the prolonging of pt may be due to increased precipitation which replenishes soil moisture and slows down the formation process of soil moisture drought following the late growing season the drought pt in most regions was significantly shortened mainly due to the changing of vpd and ai as can be seen from fig s1 a the temperature of the whole region in the study area showed a significant rise in the late growing season resulting in an increase in vpd and potential evapotranspiration fig s1 d when the meteorological drought occurs therefore soil moisture will dissipate more rapidly in evapotranspiration triggering quick soil moisture drought in addition precipitation in the late growing season also shows a downward trend throughout most of the study area fig s1 b leading to a reduction of soil water supplement and ai index a drying trend in the regional climate and eventually accelerated drought propagation besides the slight prolongation of drought pt in the southeast of the study area may be related to the local increased precipitation it should be noted that the pt in the central and western regions is initially short in the late growing season in this case the shortened pt will make the reserved warning time become tenser which will further aggravate the drought resistance challenge during the period in addition to precipitation vpd and ai vegetation also has a significant indirect impact on the trend in drought propagation which will be discussed in detail in section 5 1 furthermore based on the pt under each sliding window we further calculated the change sequence of tr and analyzed its dynamic trend likewise using the mann kendall method as shown in fig 11 the change of tr is generally consistent with that of pt early growing season i e may and june drought tr has a significant prolonging trend but by the middle and late growing season i e from july to september the drought tr begins to decline especially in the central and western regions the drought tr trend is largely affected by the change of drought pt for example the shortening of drought pt will shorten the precipitation accumulation scale which will reduce drought tr and vice versa in areas where drought pt is prolonged late in the growing season both pt and tr were declining in the vast central and western regions which means that when meteorological drought strikes it will take less time and lower precipitation deficit to trigger soil moisture drought this case will lead to a greater risk of propagation between droughts invalidating drought control and prevention efforts and probably further deteriorating drought impacts 5 discussion 5 1 the driving force analysis of drought propagation characteristic dynamics previous studies have shown that warming plays an important role in the hydrological cycle as the rise of temperature may aggravate the loss of water and lead to regional dryness and droughts trenberth et al 2014 the significant warming in nec leads to rise in vpd in the late growth season thereby increasing the demand for water in the atmosphere thus promoting the evaporation consumption of soil moisture li et al 2020 zhang et al 2022a zhou et al 2020 warming is also expected to increase potential evapotranspiration together with the decreasing precipitation in the late growing season resulting in a decline in the ai index and regional climate showing a drying trend the above factors will significantly promote the actual evaporation of soil water and accelerate soil moisture drought and shortening pt in the late growth season in addition to precipitation vpd and ai vegetation also plays a critical role in the propagation of drought signals being the medium for water and energy exchange between soil and atmosphere systems vegetation has significant impacts on regional water cycle and drought evolution gao et al 2018 huang et al 2018 on the one hand the sustained increase of vegetation coverage can increase soil water consumption in a certain area which may exceed the water resource carrying capacity of the area causing a decrease in soil water and making it more prone to soil moisture drought lian et al 2020 zhang et al 2021d on the other hand with the increase of vegetation greenness when facing meteorological drought as the vpd rises soil water can evaporate quickly into the atmosphere through the stomata of vegetation leaves jiao et al 2021 accelerating the rate of soil moisture consumption and ultimately shortening the propagation time from meteorological drought to soil moisture drought previous studies have also found that vegetation greening increases soil water loss by transpiration from an expanded leaf area chen et al 2019 zeng et al 2018 and exacerbates the risk of regional drought especially in arid and semiarid areas deng et al 2020 zhang et al 2022a in this study the ndvi index was used to analyze the dynamic changes in the vegetation cover in nec since 1982 it was found that the vegetation cover in the study area increased significantly in the late growing season while in the early period most of the areas mainly showed a downward trend fig 12 ndvi series and hydrometeorological factors p vpd and ai were introduced into the random forest model by using 19 sliding windows to further quantify the impact of different factors on drought pt fig s5 shows the spatial distribution of two factors that have the most significant impact on the drought pt it can be seen that the vegetation cover change in some regions even exceeds the direct impact of hydrometeorological factors on drought propagation with the vegetation greening in the late growing season when meteorological drought occurs soil water may be rapidly evaporated and consumed through vegetation channels which accelerates the propagation process of drought signals in the atmosphere and soil moisture after normalizing the influences of various factors on drought propagation processes we found that the relative importance of ndvi could reach more than 20 of the total importance fig 13 and the change of vegetation cover had a significant impact on drought propagation in addition we found that vegetation also has an impact on the drought propagation in the early growing season may to june which is mainly related to the decline of large area vegetation cover in the central and eastern regions fig 12 with the decline of vegetation cover its demand for water decreased indirectly alleviating soil moisture consumption and prolonging the drought pt during this period however the increase of vegetation cover in the western edge regions in the early growing season may accelerate the consumption of soil water and shorten the drought pt in this area 5 2 sensitivity analysis of some important results regarding threshold and sliding window length set in this study the dynamic change trend of drought pt and tr from 1962 to 2014 was evaluated by using a 31 years sliding window in order to avoid the influence of the length of the selected sliding window on the results different lengths i e 19 23 27 and 35 years were used for verification respectively the results show that the dynamic trend of pt and tr is basically independent of the length of the sliding window and the change trend under different windows is largely consistent figs s3 and s4 which indicates the robustness of the results when determining the drought pt and tr we set different extraction probability thresholds fig s2 shows the conditional probability matrix of soil moisture drought in the calculation of drought pt with 15 randomly selected grids the vertical coordinate in the figure represents the time cumulative scale of spi and the horizontal coordinate represents each month of the 15 grids in the growing season it can be seen from the figure that it often requires a longer time accumulation in the early growing season to make the probability of soil moisture drought to reach a higher level while the time required in the late growth season is relatively short the probability value of each month increases continuously with the rising of cumulative time and gradually remains unchanged after reaching a higher level when extracting the drought pt we did not choose the meteorological drought accumulation scale corresponding to the highest probability of soil moisture drought but instead took 0 6 as the probability threshold the reason for this is that the pt extracted under the highest probability is generally extensively long and the cumulative time before the maximum probability is also prone to causing soil moisture drought li et al 2022b we therefore selected a medium probability 0 6 to extract the drought pt so as not to ignore the short drought pt in addition when determining the tr we set a higher probability threshold 0 8 than the extraction of pt to further ensure the credibility of causing soil moisture drought in addition in the practical drought warning operation the probability threshold for extracting propagation time can be flexibly adjusted to obtain different lengths of pt which can be combined with the tr to grasp the development status of drought and respond in a timely manner taking the drought warning of a certain month as an example first collect precipitation data from the preceding month and obtain a longer pt by increasing the probability threshold e g 0 65 0 7 0 8 next calculate the total precipitation within the time range of the pt subtract it from the long term average to obtain the actual precipitation deficit finally compare the precipitation deficit with the drought tr of that month if the precipitation deficit exceeds tr it indicates a high possibility of triggering soil moisture drought at this time water resource managers should take timely measures to block the propagation chain of drought by reasonable allocation of water resources on the contrary if the precipitation deficit does not exceed tr it indicates a lower possibility of soil moisture drought occurring at this time the probability threshold of pt can then be lowered to obtain a shorter drought pt and the precipitation deficit within the new time accumulation range should be checked again to see if it exceeds the tr value therefore by repeatedly adjusting and testing the possibility of drought occurrence we can timely understand the development status of drought and try to avoid biases and misjudgments caused by a single judgment as much as possible based on the drought early warning system described above reliable pt and tr can be used to obtain key drought resistant information for example by subtracting tr from the actual precipitation deficit we can determine the necessary water quantity for alleviating soil moisture drought and compare this water deficit with the currently available water resources to estimate the potential range of drought impact and possible economic losses in advance 5 3 comparison analysis between some findings of this study and previous studies drought pt is an important characteristic of drought signal propagation between atmospheric and soil moisture system zhang et al 2021a moreover accurate pt is a prerequisite to estimating the tr of soil moisture drought in this study using the bayesian causal analysis framework the conditional probability of soil moisture drought was used to determine the pt compared to the traditional correlation coefficient method the conditional probability method can directly separate the propagation signal from the dependency relationship between precipitation and soil moisture to avoid the interference from non drought information dai et al 2022 wu et al 2021b additionally the propagation process can be analyzed under different drought grades li et al 2022b zhu et al 2021 this study shows that the pt is long in the early growing season spring and early summer and relatively short in the middle and late growing period summer and autumn which is consistent with the seasonal distribution of drought pt in previous studies xu et al 2021 zhang et al 2022b however the pt in the early growing season may and june in nec is longer than previous research findings possibly associated with the geography of the region the study area is located in the northernmost part of china compared with other regions in the same period its higher latitude results in lower temperature and relatively weak evaporation capacity and it has plenty of natural forest land which can prolong the melting time of ice snow and frozen soil wang et al 2015 wang et al 2019 the solid water melted into the soil during the early growing season as the temperature increased alleviating the soil moisture drought slowing the propagation of drought and making pt from meteorological to soil moisture drought over 270 days fig 8 a in the same period however the pt in the loess plateau located in the inland region of northwest china generally does not exceed 6 months dai et al 2022 li et al 2022b furthermore the drought pt and tr in most areas of nec have shown a significant downward trend during the late growing season which will exacerbate the risk of drought propagation accelerate the formation of soil moisture droughts and ultimately increase the possibility of flash drought in these areas xu et al 2021 zhu et al 2021 the literature revealed that the frequency duration and intensity of flash drought in nec increased from 1961 to 2016 zhang et al 2022a which is agrees with our findings 6 conclusion in this study pt and tr of meteorological drought to the soil moisture drought with different drought grades were determined using the copula functions and a bayesian causal analysis framework we also assessed the dynamic trend of drought propagation characteristics in recent decades under the warming and greening background and identified the possible driving factors on the drought propagation the main conclusions of this study are as follows 1 in early growing season i e may and june the pt required to cause soil moisture drought is longer with an average of more than 200 days and after entering the middle and late growing season i e from july to september pt began to shorten and the shortest pt in july and august was generally less than 30 days the temporal and spatial distribution of drought pt is mainly related to the water and energy characteristics in each month of the growing season and the regional underlying surface conditions in addition with the aggravation of soil moisture drought the pt required to cause soil moisture drought also increased 2 the distribution of tr in the nec has remained relatively constant over time spatially the tr in the western region of the study area is relatively low generally below 80 mm while it is high in the central and eastern regions this is mainly related to the overall pattern of precipitation showing more in the east and less in the west in the study area furthermore the tr required to trigger soil moisture drought also have an increasing trend with the increasing grades of drought 3 dynamic trend analysis of drought propagation characteristics indicates that the drought pt in the early growing season i e may and june shows a prolonging trend in most regions of the study area which may be related to the accelerated dissolution of snow cover and frozen soil and the decline of vegetation cover during this period however in the late growing season i e from july to september the situation began to reverse the pt and tr showed a significant downward trend in the central and western regions of the study area and the analysis found that the temperature showed a significant rising trend in the late growing season which driving the increase of vpd and the decrease of ai and the vegetation greening also played an important role in this period these factors together increased the rate of soil water consumption and accelerated the propagation of drought signals it should be noted that in the late growing season due to the dual impacts of warming and vegetation greening the risk of drought propagation is greatly increased resulting in both the pt and tr showed a significant downward trend in the central and western regions of the nec which will make these regions faster and easier to cause soil moisture drought after the meteorological drought occurs and the response time reserved for people will be shortened furthermore the drought pt and tr can be used together to obtain important drought resistance information in advance this method is relatively simple and can be used in other regions to help policy makers water resources managers and local stakeholders

1789,quantifying the propagation time pt and trigger threshold tr from meteorological to soil moisture drought is critically important for drought early warning and precise defense nevertheless existing propagation characteristics usually have a low temporal spatial resolution and their dynamics and related driving mechanisms such as global warming and greening are still incompletely understood to fill the knowledge gap this study proposes a drought propagation model based on the bayesian causal analysis framework for quantifying the pt and tr with a high resolution taking northeast china nec as a case study we further explore the dynamics of drought propagation characteristics in recent decades and possible driving mechanisms using the sliding window and random forest model results showed that 1 the drought pt varies spatially and temporally in the study area with long pt in the central plain and western high altitude areas in the early growing season typically over 200 days while short in the middle and late growing season in most regions less than one month in july and august the tr is generally lower than 80 mm in the western regions and do not change significantly with time 2 the pt and tr in the vast central and western regions exhibit a downward trend in the late growing season resulting in a strikingly increased risk of drought propagation 3 increasing vapor pressure deficit vpd due to warming along with decreasing aridity index ai due to precipitation shortage are the main drivers on the accelerated drought propagation moreover local greening has also played a critical role in accelerating propagation via transpiration that consumes soil water which contributes more than 20 to propagation dynamics overall this study sheds new insights into drought propagation dynamics and mechanisms in a changing environment providing a promising avenue for drought early warning and mitigation keywords meteorological drought soil moisture drought propagation time and trigger threshold propagation dynamics and mechanism warming and greening drought early warning data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction drought is an extreme water shortage phenomenon in the process of terrestrial hydrological cycle which is usually hidden and difficult to forecast in advance mishra and singh 2011 in many cases drought can be hardly realized until it has caused considerable losses to the ecological environment agricultural production and social economy chen et al 2022a mahecha et al 2022 yao et al 2022 zhao and wang 2021 according to the affected objects drought is generally classified into four categories meteorological drought i e rainfall deficit agricultural drought i e soil moisture deficit hydrological drought i e abnormal reduction of river streamflow and socio economic drought i e imbalance of water supply and demand affecting economic development zhang et al 2022b typically in nature different types of drought rarely occur in isolation in the hydrological cycle and their causative relationships are often entwined van loon 2015 zhang et al 2022b drought signal generally starts from the abnormal decrease of precipitation mishra and singh 2010 for example with the precipitation deficit persists soil moisture stored in the early stage will be continuously dissipated by evapotranspiration then the soil moisture drought may be triggered if the precipitation cannot be replenished in time the drought signal may continue to propagate downward along the hydrological cycle and eventually resulting in hydrological drought or even groundwater drought kumar et al 2016 tijdeman et al 2022 vicente serrano et al 2020 the process of drought signals transmitting along the hydrological cycle is known as drought propagation apurv et al 2017 zhang et al 2021a developing a holistic understanding of the propagation process of drought signals in the hydrological cycle system can reveal the formation principle of drought and provide a new path for drought early warning li et al 2022b in general meteorological drought is the precursor of other types of droughts but the shortage of precipitation usually does not lead to other drought types immediately there are obvious time accumulation and threshold effects in the evolution of drought taking meteorological to soil moisture drought as an example the drought signal needs to continue for a period of time after the onset of meteorological drought to accumulate the shortage of precipitation when this precipitation deficiency beyond a certain threshold it may lead to a decrease in soil moisture thereby triggering soil moisture drought the time and threshold effects in the process of drought development are generally defined as drought propagation time pt and triggering threshold tr tijdeman et al 2022 wu et al 2021b having advance knowledge of the drought propagation characteristics pt and tr in a particular region is crucial for local water resource managers to timely understand the development status and severity of drought estimate the amount of water resources required to alleviate it and determine when to take appropriate measures han et al 2021b these key pieces of information are vital for early warning and risk management of drought in recent years the propagation between different types of droughts has received increasing attention in the hydrological community apurv et al 2017 zhang et al 2021b earlier studies on the drought propagation commonly employed a relatively simple correlation coefficient method to identify and analyze the general relationship between different drought types barker et al 2016 huang et al 2017 lópez moreno et al 2013 for example the pt of meteorological drought to hydrological drought can be determined by using the cumulative scales of the standardized precipitation index spi that corresponds to the maximum correlation coefficient between different cumulative scales of spi and the standardized streamflow index ssi huang et al 2017 in subsequent studies the run theory was usually used to extract drought events in drought index series and then identified the propagation process between droughts by matching different types of drought events bevacqua et al 2021 wu et al 2018 however the data length can limit the number of drought events that may be finally matched recently some studies employed probability based methods to estimate the probability of soil moisture drought caused by meteorological drought and further analyzed the relationship between different types of droughts xu et al 2021 zhang et al 2021c zhu et al 2021 additionally hydrological models have also been used to investigate the propagation of droughts at the basin scale such methods have a sound physical basis zhang et al 2021a and can simulate the changes in hydrological variables for analyzing how drought signals propagate in spite of these the models often involve many parameters to be estimated and may suffer from the equifinality issue for different parameters which complicates their usage furthermore the quality and length of data in many regions are often insufficient to meet the requirement of the models which also hinders their practical applications konapala and mishra 2020 melsen and guse 2019 zhang et al 2022b these studies have provided valuable insights that improved our understanding of drought propagation processes in the hydrological cycle and the formation mechanism of drought disasters but the research on drought propagation is still in the initial stage in the process of drought propagation pt and tr are two important characteristics determining whether or not the drought signal propagates downward and as well as the key parameters for early warning and drought prevention guo et al 2020 however most of the current studies focus on the calculation and analysis of the pt between different droughts while the drought tr which indicates the precipitation deficit required for drought signal transmission remains unclear in addition most of the current research investigated drought propagation processes only at the seasonal scale however quantitative studies for the months of the growing season are rare and the unit of the pt is typically measured on a monthly scale so the temporal resolution needs to be improved to meet the application requirements li et al 2022b furthermore it is remains unclear whether the fluctuation of regional water and energy conditions in a warming climate will change the drought propagation process especially in the cold regions of higher latitudes peng et al 2019 as a component of the terrestrial ecosystem vegetation plays a significant role in the water and energy exchange between land and atmosphere bonan 2008 cheng et al 2022 seneviratne et al 2010 and is a bridge to connect and regulate the soil moisture atmosphere feedback process li et al 2018 zhao et al 2022 therefore it will be necessary to investigate whether the dynamic change of vegetation especially in the greening regions will exacerbate the propagation of drought signals between meteorology and soil moisture guo et al 2023 in the absence of studies addressing these topics the driving mechanisms of drought propagation under changing environments remain largely unknown northeast china nec is the main production base of corn soybean and animal husbandry in china which has an important impact on food security in china and even the world wan et al 2022 in addition nec is also rich in forest resources it is one of the major carbon sink areas in china and has important ecological functions ge et al 2022 however under the background of global warming due to the relatively high latitude of nec the temperature in this region has risen significantly in recent decades zhang et al 2022a and the drought has shown an increasing trend guo et al 2017 zhao et al 2020 this will bring unprecedented challenges to agricultural production and ecological environment protection in nec li et al 2022a to sum up in order to effectively warn against soil moisture drought this study attempts to address the following three scientific questions 1 how to effectively estimate the temporal and spatial distribution of drought pt and tr throughout the growing season 2 how pt and tr respond to the warming and greening contexts 3 which factors dominate the drought propagation dynamics and what the propagation mechanisms that drive drought signals are taking nec as the study area the study used the spi and standardized soil moisture index ssmi to characterize meteorological and soil moisture drought respectively based on the proposed drought propagation evaluation framework five cupula functions were utilized to establish the connection between precipitation and soil moisture and the pt and tr required for soil moisture drought at various grades were extracted with a ten days resolution we further investigated the dynamic trend of drought propagation characteristics using a sliding window and the important influencing factors were determined by using a random forest model finally the driving mechanisms behind of drought propagation processes under changing environment were analyzed overall this study is expected to provide a scientific basis for drought early warning and drought disaster management the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 2 will introduce the overview of the study area and show the basic information of the data used and section 3 will explain the principle and procedure of the method used in this study then section 4 will show and analyze the results obtained section 5 is the discussion part and finally the main conclusions of this paper will be given in section 6 2 study area and data 2 1 study area northeast china nec is located in the northeast of the eurasian continent 115 52 135 09 e 38 40 53 56 it covers four provinces and cities with a total area of about 1 25 million km2 topographically nec features a plain surrounded by mountains on its three sides in the middle of the study area is the northeast great plain which consists of sanjiang plain songnen plain and liaohe plain the great plain is surrounded by the greater khingan mountains in the west the lesser khingan mountains in the north and the changbai mountains in the east fig 1 a the nec has a temperate continental monsoon climate which is warm and rainy in summer and cold and long in winter from south to north it crosses the middle temperate zone and the sub frigid zone where the annual average temperature drops from 11 7 c to 5 c from east to west the nec crosses semi humid semiarid and arid areas with the annual total precipitation gradually declining from 1000 mm to less than 200 mm fig 1 b as the third largest black soil belt in the world the northeast great plain is rich in organic matter with the total grain output accounting for more than 1 5 of the country wan et al 2022 in addition the mountains surrounding the plain are the largest distribution area of natural forests in china fig 1 c ge et al 2022 the high forest coverage can prolong ice and snow melting which boosts local agriculture and forestry due to the forest snow storage however climate change has considerably increased the temperature zhang et al 2022a and exacerbated drought in nec over the recent decades guo et al 2017 zhao et al 2020 which is extremely unfavorable for rainfed agriculture in the region 2 2 dataset this study mainly used the long time series of precipitation and soil moisture data from 1962 to 2014 to establish the relationship between meteorological drought and soil moisture drought the daily gridded precipitation is from the china national meteorological information center http www cma gov cn 2011qxfw 2011qsjgx which was produced by 2472 national meteorological observation stations by spatial interpolation with a resolution of 0 5 0 5 this dataset has been widely verified as reliable and extensively used in the monitoring and evaluation of regional drought fang et al 2019 monthly soil moisture data were derived from global land data assistance system version 2 gldas 2 0 https disc gsfc nasa gov with a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 this dataset has been verified in many regions of china as well providing reliable soil moisture data for agricultural drought research wang et al 2016 zhang et al 2017b in addition the potential evapotranspiration pet and vapor pressure deficit vpd were calculated using the meteorological variables such as temperature pressure wind speed radiation and relative humidity in the gldas 2 0 dataset 1962 2014 which were likewise widely applied in china han et al 2021a li et al 2022b besides we used the ndvi index 1981 2014 provided by the global inventory monitoring and mapping system gimms ndvi3g https ecocast arc nasa gov data pub gimms 3g v0 to analyze the impact of vegetation cover change on drought evolution in recent decades in this study monthly soil moisture and meteorological data with 0 25 0 25 resolution and monthly ndvi data with 8 km 8 km resolution were upscaled to 0 5 0 5 in order to match the spatial resolution of the precipitation dataset 3 methods fig 2 illustrates the method framework of this paper which consists of five main procedures 1 calculating the standardized meteorological and soil moisture drought index 2 establishing the relationship between soil moisture and precipitation 3 quantifying the pt of soil moisture drought at different magnitudes 4 quantifying the drought tr and 5 driving force analysis of the possible trend in drought propagation characteristics the details of the method framework are explained as follows 3 1 standardized drought indices in recent decades many drought indicators have been proposed among which the standardized drought indices constructed on the template of spi have developed the most rapidly zhang et al 2022b the principle of constructing such indices is to fit specific hydrological variables e g precipitation runoff and soil moisture through appropriate probability distribution functions e g gamma and gaussian distribution after calculating the probability of each hydrological variable value under the target cumulative scale the corresponding drought indices can be finally obtained through standard normalization of the probability values han et al 2021a this approach was first proposed by mckee et al 1993 and compared with traditional drought indicators such as pdsi these indices have variable time scales allowing drought conditions to be evaluated flexibly on monthly seasonal or annual scales in accordance with the needs fang et al 2019 in addition due to the standardized processing the indices are spatiotemporal comparable and the calculation is also relatively straightforward with fewer data requirements because of these advantages drought indices developed with this principle e g spi spei ssmi and ssi have gained widespread use in drought research worldwide bevacqua et al 2021 choudhury et al 2021 kalisa et al 2020 peng et al 2020 zhao et al 2020 the spei is a drought index established based on the water balance of a certain region the difference between potential evapotranspiration and actual precipitation the main advantage of this index is that it can comprehensively consider the meteorological drought development status of a certain region from both precipitation and potential evaporation aspects however the theme of this study is to establish a direct relationship between atmospheric precipitation and soil moisture and further investigate the propagation process of meteorological drought to soil moisture drought in addition the soil moisture drought triggering threshold calculated in this article is also expressed by the degree of actual precipitation deficit therefore in characterizing meteorological drought this article uses the spi index which can directly reflect the surplus or deficit of precipitation while considering potential evapotranspiration as an important driving factor in the drought propagation process then ssmi was used to characterize soil moisture drought a ten days cumulative unit was used as the minimum cumulative unit in calculating the spi index for every month during the growing season i e may to september on the time scale of 1 36 ten days by establishing the relationship between spi at different cumulative scales and ssmi at monthly scales the propagation characteristics from meteorological drought to soil moisture drought are further estimated see section 3 2 here the calculation steps of spi and ssmi will be skipped which can be referred to han et al 2021a li et al 2022b for more details the grading criteria for standardized drought indices are shown in table 1 after obtaining the standardized drought indices in order to the preparation for the next step to establishing the joint distribution between precipitation and soil moisture we calculated the pearson correlation coefficients between the spi and ssmi in respective scales eq 1 to analyze the spatial and temporal distribution of the dependence of soil moisture on the precipitation series at different scales 1 r ij c o r r sp i ij s s m i j where i denotes the cumulative scale of spi i 1 2 36 ten days j denotes the month in the growing season from may to september and rij is the pearson correlation coefficient between the monthly scale ssmi series in month j and spi series with accumulated scale of i ten days 3 2 quantification of drought propagation time and trigger threshold 3 2 1 constructing joint distribution based on the copula theory how to construct a multidimensional joint distribution is the premise and core of studying the interdependent structure of hydrological variables traditionally the joint distribution functions were built through multidimensional probability distributions e g multidimensional gaussian distribution or exponential distribution however the approach generally demands specific distributions for the marginal distribution of variables which greatly limits its applicability the proposal and improvement of copula function provide a new solution to the above problem fang et al 2019 wu et al 2021a basically the copula function is used to describe the multidimensional correlation structure which connects the marginal distribution functions due to unrestricted forms of marginal distribution as well as the flexibility and diversity of copula function this approach has been widely used in the hydrological community to analyze the relationship between different hydrometeorological variables fang et al 2019 wu et al 2021a zhao et al 2020 in this study five two dimensional copula functions commonly used in the field of hydrology see table 2 were selected to establish the joint distribution of monthly ssmi and spi at different time scales regardless of which copular function is used the joint distribution f sp i i s s m i of spi and ssmi series is calculated as follows 2 f sp i i s s m i spi s s m i p sp i i s p i s s m i s s m i c f sp i i spi f ssmi ssmi where f sp i i and f ssmi represent the marginal distribution functions of spi and ssmi sequences respectively i denotes the cumulative scale of spi and its value is 1to36 ten days c is the one of the five copula functions in this study the optimal copula function for each grid was determined by the least squared euclidean distance sed 3 2 2 identification of the drought propagation time the drought pt was determined by the conditional probability of meteorological drought leading to soil moisture drought which was calculated by a bayesian causal analysis framework the specific procedures are as follows 1 firstly the conditional probability of meteorological drought leading to different grades of soil moisture drought under different time scales is calculated as follows 3 p i j p ssm i j d s s p i ji d s p s s m i j d s s p i ji d s p sp i ji d s c f ssm i j ds f sp i ji ds f sp i i ds where ds denote different drought grades the values are 0 5 1 and 1 5 represent mild moderate and severe soil moisture drought scenarios respectively p ji indicates the probability of soil moisture drought above ds grade caused by meteorological drought with a cumulative scale of i ten days in month j c represents the joint distribution function using the optimal copula function 2 based on the probability value p ji calculated by eq 3 the drought propagation probability matrix pm as follows 4 p m p 1 36 p 2 36 p 3 36 p 4 36 p 5 36 p 1 2 p 2 2 p 3 2 p 4 2 p 5 2 p 1 1 p 2 1 p 3 1 p 4 1 p 5 1 where each row of the matrix represents the probability of causing soil moisture drought at one of the 36 ten days accumulation scales and each column represents one of the five months in the growing season i e from may to september fig 3 schematically illustrates the calculation of the probability matrix then a probability threshold pi is selected to determine the pt from the probability matrix if the matrix contains a probability greater than the threshold the meteorological drought cumulative scale i that first reaches the threshold will be regarded as the pt from meteorological drought to soil moisture drought pt i here the threshold is configured as 0 6 and the details will be discussed in section 5 2 3 2 3 quantifying drought trigger threshold based on obtaining the pt tr i e the total amount of precipitation deficit required to trigger soil moisture drought within the duration of a continued water shortage period of pt can be further identified the basic idea for quantifying tr is to first establish the joint distribution between the soil moisture series of each month and the accumulated precipitation series under the corresponding pt then using conditional probability formula eq 5 calculate the probability of soil moisture drought occurrence under different levels of precipitation deficits and finally select the tr for drought propagation based on this probability the specific procedures are as follows firstly the probability of soil moisture drought caused by different precipitation intervals under the pt accumulation scale is calculated with following equation 5 p j p s m j s m p r 1 p r j p t p r p s m j s m p r 1 p r j p t p r p p r 1 p r j p t p r p s m j s m p r j p t p r p s m j s m p r j p t p r 1 p p r j p t p r p p r j p t p r 1 c f s m j s m f p r j p t p r c f s m j s m f p r j p t p r 1 f p r j p t p r f p r j p t p r 1 where pt is the drought pt in month j prjpt represents the total amount of precipitation within the duration range of pt s m j represents the status of soil moisture in month j sm refers to the soil moisture content corresponding to the occurrence of drought at the ds grade pr is a looping variable whose initial value represents the total precipitation amount accumulated within the pt time range corresponding to the occurrence of meteorological drought at the ds grade p j refers to the probability of triggering soil moisture drought under the state range of precipitation total within pr 1 pr next the precipitation interval pr 1 pr will be iteratively reduced by a step of 1 mm and eq 5 will be used to calculate the probability values of soil moisture drought caused under different precipitation intervals when the probability value exceeds the preset threshold of 0 8 to ensure that tr has higher reliability we set a probability threshold higher than that of pt the iteration is stopped at this point tr is equal to the difference between the multi year average precipitation in the pt time range and the pr value at the end of the iteration tr pr p r where pr is the multi year average precipitation in other words tr represents the total precipitation deficit relative to normal state that is required to trigger soil moisture drought and its unit is millimeters 3 3 exploring drought propagation dynamics and possible drivers in order to identify the dynamic trend of the propagation characteristics in the changing environments we segmented the original data using a sliding window with a length of 31 years and then calculated each window independently by the method described in section 3 2 to determine how drought pt and tr have changed over recent decades to test the significance of the trend the mann kendall trend test method mk with a significance level of 0 05 was used burn and hag elnur 2002 this study used random forest model to evaluate the importance of different predictors for identifying possible drivers of the trend in propagation characteristics the random forest model is one of machine learning algorithms which was first proposed by breiman 2001 and has been widely used to solve classification and regression problems giri et al 2023 rosecrans et al 2022 the model is essentially a classifier with multiple decision trees its operation step is to first use the bootstrap resampling method to randomly extract multiple samples from the original data then train and fit each bootstrap sample to build a regression tree and finally the final result is obtained by averaging with the prediction results of all regression trees jing et al 2020 xie et al 2021 it is a nonlinear modeling tool that has a reliable result for solving multivariate prediction problems and has a good tolerance to outliers and noise chagas et al 2016 guo et al 2015 zhang et al 2017a in this study we established a random forest model consisting of 500 regression trees the cart method was used to split the decision tree and the minimum terminal node size was defined as 5 then we used the permutation importance method to rank the importance of each influencing variable the specific approach is to randomly shuffle the normal time sequence of the detection variables and re inputting the broken variables into the model for calculation the importance of the variables is evaluated based on the degree of decrease in model prediction accuracy with greater decreases indicating a larger impact of the variable on the dependent variable pham and brabyn 2017 we use the random forest model to rank the importance of the main driving factors such as aridity index ai precipitation change p vapor pressure deficit vpd and normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and to identify the dominant factors that affect the drought propagation characteristics for more details about the random forest algorithm can refer to the literature huang et al 2022 xie et al 2021 in addition the introduction and calculation method of ai and vpd are shown in appendix s1 4 results 4 1 dependence of soil moisture on precipitation in growing season before establishing the joint distribution between soil moisture and precipitation in the study area the correlation of soil moisture and precipitation at different cumulative scales was analyzed as shown in fig 4 a the maximum correlation coefficient between spi and ssmi series was selected to draw the spatial temporal distribution diagram in general the soil moisture and precipitation showed a positive correlation in each month of the growing season from the time perspective the correlation in the early growing season i e may to june is slightly lower than in the middle and late periods i e july to september this difference is probably associated with the snow cover and frozen soil melting that weaken the link between soil water and precipitation during the early growing season chen et al 2022b wang et al 2015 from the perspective of spatial distribution the correlation is relatively high in the western part of the nec while lower in the central region for the western part the lack of rains making a strong link between soil moisture and precipitation in contrast the central region occupies mostly low lying alluvial plains where farmland wetlands and marshes are widely spread the soil moisture content is thus higher than that in other regions with a relatively weak natural connection to precipitation in addition the optimal response time of the soil moisture to the precipitation i e spi accumulation time corresponding to the maximum correlation coefficient is shown in fig 4 b in the early stage of the growing season the response time is longer and gradually shortens as the month progresses during the early growing season when temperature is generally low evaporation and dissipation capacity of soil water are limited and early snowfall and frozen soil dissolution can further replenish soil moisture as a result soil moisture is relatively weakly dependent on precipitation and responds slowly to the possible precipitation deficits at the later stage of the growing season however with the increase in temperature and evapotranspiration the connection between soil moisture and precipitation is strengthened which reduces the response time in general soil moisture in the nec depends heavily on precipitation in the growing season which is the precondition to establishing the joint distribution of soil moisture and precipitation and calculating the drought pt 4 2 propagation time from meteorological to soil moisture drought fig 5 shows the spatiotemporal distribution of drought pt in the study area and fig 8 a summaries the spatial average of drought pt for grids under different drought grades in each month of the growing season in terms of time the pt in the early growing season i e may to june is relatively long generally exceeding 200 days while it shortens in the middle and late growing seasons i e july to september fig 8 a in most regions of the study area the pt in july and august is typically less than 30 days the shortest level of the entire growing season while the pt in september is slightly longer roughly from 40 to 100 days fig 5 as seen from space the pt is longer in the central plain western plateau area and northern high latitude coniferous forest areas than it is elsewhere it is further obvious that the pt required progressively increases as soil moisture droughts worsen fig 8 a the blank part in fig 5 indicates that the probability of soil moisture drought caused by meteorological drought does not exceed the predefined probability threshold i e 0 6 in the case note that with the drought severity increases more grids fail to meet the requirement of probability especially in the central region the above temporal and spatial patterns of the pt are largely related to the water and heat conditions during the growing season as well as the topography and underlying surface conditions when it comes to a mild soil moisture drought for example in the early growing season i e may to june the temperature is relatively low fig 6 a and the evaporation is also weak so the soil water cannot dissipate as readily in addition plant leaves are not fully developed in the early growing season fig 6 d which reduces the demand for soil water and vapor that can pass through stomata hao et al 2021 the relatively high latitude of nec and the long cold winter that resulted in the large amount of snow and frozen soil melting in the western and northern regions can also contribute to soil moisture peng et al 2016 wang et al 2019 xu et al 2022 in light of the above reasons soil moisture loss can be slower during early growing season when precipitation is lacking and soil water can be replenished to some extent resulting in a relatively difficult propagation of signals from the meteorological drought to the soil moisture and thus relatively long pt however even though the precipitation of soil replenishment increased in the summer see fig 6 b as the temperature and solar radiation reached their highest level of the whole growing season soil water evaporation accelerated meanwhile the plant leaves have been fully developed thus the water vapor dissipated by the vegetation has also enhanced zhang and zhang 2019 therefore when the meteorological drought comes the water stored in the soil will be quickly dissipated through the soil surface and foliar under the promotion of high temperature causing the soil moisture drought to occur and the shortest pt in july and august in september the dissipation rate of soil moisture decreased along with the decrease in temperature and vegetation greenness prolonging the drought pt slightly from the perspective of spatial distribution the central northern and western regions of the study area have longer pt than other regions especially in july which may be explained by the terrain and underlying surface conditions in the region the area with a long pt in the central region of the study area is mainly located in the songnen plain which is mainly formed by erosion and alluviation of the songhua river and nenjiang river this region has relatively low terrain a dense river network and a high soil moisture content fig 6 c which makes the connection between soil moisture and precipitation relatively weak it can be seen from the low correlation between soil moisture and precipitation in the central region of fig 4 a consequently meteorological droughts usually take a longer pt to cause soil moisture droughts in the region western and northern parts of the nec on the other hand are located in the inner mongolia plateau and the greater khingan mountains respectively both have high altitudes especially in the western region where the average altitude exceeds 2 000 m fig 2 a the resulting low temperatures may weaken the relationship between soil moisture drought and meteorological drought further the northern region is dominated by coniferous forest fig 2 c as compared to broad leaved forests distributed in other mountains in the study area coniferous forests have smaller leaf areas and weaker transpiration ouyang et al 2021 and their soil water demands are also lower than broad leaved forests as a result of above factors soil moisture consumption rates are relatively low when meteorological drought occurs which may explain the longer pt in both regions furthermore when the soil moisture drought grades grow meteorological droughts often require accumulating for a longer period to cause higher grades in the meanwhile the grid that is capable of reaching the trigger probability will also decrease which is more evident in areas with a weak dependence between soil moisture and precipitation see fig 4 a and fig 5 overall the drought pt in the vast areas of the nec is usually the shortest in july and august in this case soil moisture drought caused by meteorological drought is often less than one month which leaves little time for people to prepare and respond it is therefore extremely unfavorable for early warning of droughts which should be of great concern to water resources managers 4 3 the trigger threshold of meteorological drought driving soil moisture drought fig 7 illustrates the spatial distribution of tr required to trigger different grades of soil moisture drought and fig 8 b shows the regional average of the tr to trigger different grades of soil moisture drought during the growing season in the figures it is clear that tr distribution has remained relatively constant over time while it is lower in the western region than in the central and eastern regions generally below 80 mm which is mainly because of the relatively low precipitation in the western region fig 2 b in addition as soil moisture drought intensify the tr required to trigger soil moisture drought also increases for mild soil moisture droughts a precipitation deficit around 80 mm is needed while moderate and severe droughts require a tr exceeding 120 and 140 mm respectively fig 8 b furthermore the tr has different temporal pattern compared to pt and it does not show an obvious downward trend in the middle and late growing season fig 8 in which case the temporal pattern of precipitation plays a large role the precipitation in nec is mainly concentrated in the middle and late growing seasons summer fig 6 b despite the short pt due to the large amount of precipitation a higher tr can be accumulated rapidly however in the early growth season the precipitation accumulation range when calculating tr is mainly in spring and winter in spite of the long pt in this case the low precipitation limits the total amount of precipitation accumulated so there is no significant difference between tr in the early and late growing seasons note that the tr was calculated by directly analyzing precipitation and soil moisture without standardized processing which made the soil moisture drought states of the regional grid reflected by the tr cannot be directly compared in space it is possible however to combine tr with the drought pt to provide important reference information for the regional drought warning and prevention taking a specific month of the growing season as an example first the time range for detecting precipitation status can be determined in advance according to the drought pt of that month and then the deficit between the current precipitation and the historical average within this cumulative scale can be calculated which can be further compared with the tr in that month if the actual precipitation deficits that exceed the drought tr indicate that a soil moisture drought is likely to occur in that month the water gap needed to block the propagation of drought signal from meteorological to soil moisture drought can be also obtained by subtracting actual precipitation deficits from tr by comparing the water gap with the current available water the severity of soil moisture drought and economic losses can be probably estimated in advance therefore according to the above methods using the pt and tr under different drought grades an early warning system for soil moisture drought in each month of the growing season can be developed to prevent and control drought precisely furthermore more drought information can be obtained by adjusting the extraction probability thresholds of pt and tr details will be elaborated in the discussion section 4 4 the dynamics of drought propagation characteristics in a changing environment in recent studies nec has been presented a significant warming trend zhang et al 2022a a major focus of the study is how the propagation from meteorological drought to soil moisture drought will be affected by the changing environment especially in terms of the pt in this study 31 year sliding windows were used to segment the original data and the pt under each window was calculated to obtain the sequence of dynamic changes in the pt then the mann kendall method was used to test its significance fig 9 shows the dynamic change trend of the drought pt in recent decades a darker red in the figure indicates a more pronounced shortening of pt while blue represents the opposite grids with a dot indicate a significant trend α 0 05 during the early growing season i e may and june the drought pt showed a significant prolonging trend in the whole study area except for a few grids in the western region as of july however the overall prolonging trend of pt started to weaken and the central and eastern regions even showed a significant shortening trend during the late growth season i e august and september the overall dynamics of pt shifted from an early prolonging trend to a significant shortening trend especially in the central and western regions several factors affect the propagation process of drought signals from the atmosphere to the soil moisture system along the hydrological cycle but they can be divided into two basic categories according to the cycle process of soil moisture source and expenditure therefore precipitation p the main source of soil water together with the aridity index ai and vapor pressure deficit vpd which affect soil moisture consumption were selected as the potential drivers of the changing pt their importance was evaluated using a random forest model the importance of different influencing factors to pt in each month of the growing season was evaluated fig 10 shows the spatial distribution of the two factors that have the greatest impacts on the pt obviously pt in most regions in may is mainly affected by vpd and precipitation whereas in june precipitation dominates the north of the study area with vpd dominating the west and southeast in comparison as of july the area with significantly shortened pt was mainly affected by vpd while the area with a prolonging trend is mainly affected by precipitation in the southeast region in august and september the area where the pt is shortened was primarily affected by the vpd and ai in early growing season may and june drought pt is characterized by a prolonged trend the above analysis indicates that vpd might be an important factor but could be also associated with the rising trend in temperature that makes the vpd rise in the study area fig s1 a and d as a result of the high latitude of nec the soil surface still stores more snow and frozen soil in the early growing season chen et al 2022b wang et al 2015 the residual snow and frozen soil in winter and spring supplement soil water can more rapidly in a warming climate which alleviates the soil moisture drought wang et al 2019 furthermore precipitation in most areas also increased fig s1 b which further supplemented soil moisture to reduce the impact of drought therefore although the vpd shows an upward trend in the early growing season the pt is prolonged due to snow melting and increased precipitation as of july the significant shortening trend of pt in the central and eastern regions of the study area was mainly due to an increase in vpd this is because the snow and frozen soil have dissolved at that time and the higher vpd caused by the rising temperature will increase the water demand of the atmosphere fig s1 d which will directly accelerate the actual evaporation consumption from the soil in the southeast region the prolonging of pt may be due to increased precipitation which replenishes soil moisture and slows down the formation process of soil moisture drought following the late growing season the drought pt in most regions was significantly shortened mainly due to the changing of vpd and ai as can be seen from fig s1 a the temperature of the whole region in the study area showed a significant rise in the late growing season resulting in an increase in vpd and potential evapotranspiration fig s1 d when the meteorological drought occurs therefore soil moisture will dissipate more rapidly in evapotranspiration triggering quick soil moisture drought in addition precipitation in the late growing season also shows a downward trend throughout most of the study area fig s1 b leading to a reduction of soil water supplement and ai index a drying trend in the regional climate and eventually accelerated drought propagation besides the slight prolongation of drought pt in the southeast of the study area may be related to the local increased precipitation it should be noted that the pt in the central and western regions is initially short in the late growing season in this case the shortened pt will make the reserved warning time become tenser which will further aggravate the drought resistance challenge during the period in addition to precipitation vpd and ai vegetation also has a significant indirect impact on the trend in drought propagation which will be discussed in detail in section 5 1 furthermore based on the pt under each sliding window we further calculated the change sequence of tr and analyzed its dynamic trend likewise using the mann kendall method as shown in fig 11 the change of tr is generally consistent with that of pt early growing season i e may and june drought tr has a significant prolonging trend but by the middle and late growing season i e from july to september the drought tr begins to decline especially in the central and western regions the drought tr trend is largely affected by the change of drought pt for example the shortening of drought pt will shorten the precipitation accumulation scale which will reduce drought tr and vice versa in areas where drought pt is prolonged late in the growing season both pt and tr were declining in the vast central and western regions which means that when meteorological drought strikes it will take less time and lower precipitation deficit to trigger soil moisture drought this case will lead to a greater risk of propagation between droughts invalidating drought control and prevention efforts and probably further deteriorating drought impacts 5 discussion 5 1 the driving force analysis of drought propagation characteristic dynamics previous studies have shown that warming plays an important role in the hydrological cycle as the rise of temperature may aggravate the loss of water and lead to regional dryness and droughts trenberth et al 2014 the significant warming in nec leads to rise in vpd in the late growth season thereby increasing the demand for water in the atmosphere thus promoting the evaporation consumption of soil moisture li et al 2020 zhang et al 2022a zhou et al 2020 warming is also expected to increase potential evapotranspiration together with the decreasing precipitation in the late growing season resulting in a decline in the ai index and regional climate showing a drying trend the above factors will significantly promote the actual evaporation of soil water and accelerate soil moisture drought and shortening pt in the late growth season in addition to precipitation vpd and ai vegetation also plays a critical role in the propagation of drought signals being the medium for water and energy exchange between soil and atmosphere systems vegetation has significant impacts on regional water cycle and drought evolution gao et al 2018 huang et al 2018 on the one hand the sustained increase of vegetation coverage can increase soil water consumption in a certain area which may exceed the water resource carrying capacity of the area causing a decrease in soil water and making it more prone to soil moisture drought lian et al 2020 zhang et al 2021d on the other hand with the increase of vegetation greenness when facing meteorological drought as the vpd rises soil water can evaporate quickly into the atmosphere through the stomata of vegetation leaves jiao et al 2021 accelerating the rate of soil moisture consumption and ultimately shortening the propagation time from meteorological drought to soil moisture drought previous studies have also found that vegetation greening increases soil water loss by transpiration from an expanded leaf area chen et al 2019 zeng et al 2018 and exacerbates the risk of regional drought especially in arid and semiarid areas deng et al 2020 zhang et al 2022a in this study the ndvi index was used to analyze the dynamic changes in the vegetation cover in nec since 1982 it was found that the vegetation cover in the study area increased significantly in the late growing season while in the early period most of the areas mainly showed a downward trend fig 12 ndvi series and hydrometeorological factors p vpd and ai were introduced into the random forest model by using 19 sliding windows to further quantify the impact of different factors on drought pt fig s5 shows the spatial distribution of two factors that have the most significant impact on the drought pt it can be seen that the vegetation cover change in some regions even exceeds the direct impact of hydrometeorological factors on drought propagation with the vegetation greening in the late growing season when meteorological drought occurs soil water may be rapidly evaporated and consumed through vegetation channels which accelerates the propagation process of drought signals in the atmosphere and soil moisture after normalizing the influences of various factors on drought propagation processes we found that the relative importance of ndvi could reach more than 20 of the total importance fig 13 and the change of vegetation cover had a significant impact on drought propagation in addition we found that vegetation also has an impact on the drought propagation in the early growing season may to june which is mainly related to the decline of large area vegetation cover in the central and eastern regions fig 12 with the decline of vegetation cover its demand for water decreased indirectly alleviating soil moisture consumption and prolonging the drought pt during this period however the increase of vegetation cover in the western edge regions in the early growing season may accelerate the consumption of soil water and shorten the drought pt in this area 5 2 sensitivity analysis of some important results regarding threshold and sliding window length set in this study the dynamic change trend of drought pt and tr from 1962 to 2014 was evaluated by using a 31 years sliding window in order to avoid the influence of the length of the selected sliding window on the results different lengths i e 19 23 27 and 35 years were used for verification respectively the results show that the dynamic trend of pt and tr is basically independent of the length of the sliding window and the change trend under different windows is largely consistent figs s3 and s4 which indicates the robustness of the results when determining the drought pt and tr we set different extraction probability thresholds fig s2 shows the conditional probability matrix of soil moisture drought in the calculation of drought pt with 15 randomly selected grids the vertical coordinate in the figure represents the time cumulative scale of spi and the horizontal coordinate represents each month of the 15 grids in the growing season it can be seen from the figure that it often requires a longer time accumulation in the early growing season to make the probability of soil moisture drought to reach a higher level while the time required in the late growth season is relatively short the probability value of each month increases continuously with the rising of cumulative time and gradually remains unchanged after reaching a higher level when extracting the drought pt we did not choose the meteorological drought accumulation scale corresponding to the highest probability of soil moisture drought but instead took 0 6 as the probability threshold the reason for this is that the pt extracted under the highest probability is generally extensively long and the cumulative time before the maximum probability is also prone to causing soil moisture drought li et al 2022b we therefore selected a medium probability 0 6 to extract the drought pt so as not to ignore the short drought pt in addition when determining the tr we set a higher probability threshold 0 8 than the extraction of pt to further ensure the credibility of causing soil moisture drought in addition in the practical drought warning operation the probability threshold for extracting propagation time can be flexibly adjusted to obtain different lengths of pt which can be combined with the tr to grasp the development status of drought and respond in a timely manner taking the drought warning of a certain month as an example first collect precipitation data from the preceding month and obtain a longer pt by increasing the probability threshold e g 0 65 0 7 0 8 next calculate the total precipitation within the time range of the pt subtract it from the long term average to obtain the actual precipitation deficit finally compare the precipitation deficit with the drought tr of that month if the precipitation deficit exceeds tr it indicates a high possibility of triggering soil moisture drought at this time water resource managers should take timely measures to block the propagation chain of drought by reasonable allocation of water resources on the contrary if the precipitation deficit does not exceed tr it indicates a lower possibility of soil moisture drought occurring at this time the probability threshold of pt can then be lowered to obtain a shorter drought pt and the precipitation deficit within the new time accumulation range should be checked again to see if it exceeds the tr value therefore by repeatedly adjusting and testing the possibility of drought occurrence we can timely understand the development status of drought and try to avoid biases and misjudgments caused by a single judgment as much as possible based on the drought early warning system described above reliable pt and tr can be used to obtain key drought resistant information for example by subtracting tr from the actual precipitation deficit we can determine the necessary water quantity for alleviating soil moisture drought and compare this water deficit with the currently available water resources to estimate the potential range of drought impact and possible economic losses in advance 5 3 comparison analysis between some findings of this study and previous studies drought pt is an important characteristic of drought signal propagation between atmospheric and soil moisture system zhang et al 2021a moreover accurate pt is a prerequisite to estimating the tr of soil moisture drought in this study using the bayesian causal analysis framework the conditional probability of soil moisture drought was used to determine the pt compared to the traditional correlation coefficient method the conditional probability method can directly separate the propagation signal from the dependency relationship between precipitation and soil moisture to avoid the interference from non drought information dai et al 2022 wu et al 2021b additionally the propagation process can be analyzed under different drought grades li et al 2022b zhu et al 2021 this study shows that the pt is long in the early growing season spring and early summer and relatively short in the middle and late growing period summer and autumn which is consistent with the seasonal distribution of drought pt in previous studies xu et al 2021 zhang et al 2022b however the pt in the early growing season may and june in nec is longer than previous research findings possibly associated with the geography of the region the study area is located in the northernmost part of china compared with other regions in the same period its higher latitude results in lower temperature and relatively weak evaporation capacity and it has plenty of natural forest land which can prolong the melting time of ice snow and frozen soil wang et al 2015 wang et al 2019 the solid water melted into the soil during the early growing season as the temperature increased alleviating the soil moisture drought slowing the propagation of drought and making pt from meteorological to soil moisture drought over 270 days fig 8 a in the same period however the pt in the loess plateau located in the inland region of northwest china generally does not exceed 6 months dai et al 2022 li et al 2022b furthermore the drought pt and tr in most areas of nec have shown a significant downward trend during the late growing season which will exacerbate the risk of drought propagation accelerate the formation of soil moisture droughts and ultimately increase the possibility of flash drought in these areas xu et al 2021 zhu et al 2021 the literature revealed that the frequency duration and intensity of flash drought in nec increased from 1961 to 2016 zhang et al 2022a which is agrees with our findings 6 conclusion in this study pt and tr of meteorological drought to the soil moisture drought with different drought grades were determined using the copula functions and a bayesian causal analysis framework we also assessed the dynamic trend of drought propagation characteristics in recent decades under the warming and greening background and identified the possible driving factors on the drought propagation the main conclusions of this study are as follows 1 in early growing season i e may and june the pt required to cause soil moisture drought is longer with an average of more than 200 days and after entering the middle and late growing season i e from july to september pt began to shorten and the shortest pt in july and august was generally less than 30 days the temporal and spatial distribution of drought pt is mainly related to the water and energy characteristics in each month of the growing season and the regional underlying surface conditions in addition with the aggravation of soil moisture drought the pt required to cause soil moisture drought also increased 2 the distribution of tr in the nec has remained relatively constant over time spatially the tr in the western region of the study area is relatively low generally below 80 mm while it is high in the central and eastern regions this is mainly related to the overall pattern of precipitation showing more in the east and less in the west in the study area furthermore the tr required to trigger soil moisture drought also have an increasing trend with the increasing grades of drought 3 dynamic trend analysis of drought propagation characteristics indicates that the drought pt in the early growing season i e may and june shows a prolonging trend in most regions of the study area which may be related to the accelerated dissolution of snow cover and frozen soil and the decline of vegetation cover during this period however in the late growing season i e from july to september the situation began to reverse the pt and tr showed a significant downward trend in the central and western regions of the study area and the analysis found that the temperature showed a significant rising trend in the late growing season which driving the increase of vpd and the decrease of ai and the vegetation greening also played an important role in this period these factors together increased the rate of soil water consumption and accelerated the propagation of drought signals it should be noted that in the late growing season due to the dual impacts of warming and vegetation greening the risk of drought propagation is greatly increased resulting in both the pt and tr showed a significant downward trend in the central and western regions of the nec which will make these regions faster and easier to cause soil moisture drought after the meteorological drought occurs and the response time reserved for people will be shortened furthermore the drought pt and tr can be used together to obtain important drought resistance information in advance this method is relatively simple and can be used in other regions to help policy makers water resources managers and local stakeholders
