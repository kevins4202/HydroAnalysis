23260,the mooring system keeps the position of a floating body in the ocean under environmental loads mooring analysis should be performed based on the accurate mathematical model in order to predict the behaviors of the floating body and the mooring system for this purpose the finite element method fem based model has been widely used in recent years to model the mooring line numerically however existing studies were only applicable to a single floating body and solved the equations of motion for the floating body and the mooring lines separately for the application to a floating crane which consists of several bodies connected to each other the coupling effect due to the relative motion of each body should be taken into account therefore in this study the fem based mooring line model applicable to a multibody system is introduced based on flexible multibody dynamics then to realize the interaction between the mooring line and the seabed the non interpenetration and slope constraints are suggested and the friction model including sticking are adopted for the verification of the suggested model comparisons with the analytic solution and the commercial software are performed finally the applications for a floating crane under various environmental loads are simulated the results show that the suggested model can be properly adapted for mooring analysis graphical abstract image 1 keywords mooring system flexible multibody dynamics seabed interaction non interpenetration constraint floating crane 1 introduction 1 1 background the mooring system is a system that includes the mooring line and anchor which keeps the position of the floating bodies under environmental loads the mooring line connects a floating body to the anchor on the seabed in the field of offshore engineering there has been a necessity to increase the dynamic analysis in a mechanical system with a simulation tool above all dynamic analysis of the mooring system is one of the active areas under investigation modeling of the mooring line is very important to predict the motion response of the floating body and the dynamic loads on the mooring lines there are two types of mooring systems depending on the method of applying a force a taut mooring system and a catenary mooring system in a taut mooring system the mooring lines can be modeled as massless springs as it keeps the position of the floating body using the tension of the mooring lines on the other hand the weight of the mooring lines plays an important role in a catenary mooring system tang et al 2009 analyzed the catenary mooring system and divided it into three types of models i e an analytic catenary model lumped mass model and finite element model the analytic catenary model faltinsen 1993 is a quasi static model which calculates the force exerted by the weight of the mooring line based on a force equilibrium equation therefore dynamic effects due to inertial and drag forces cannot be considered the lumped mass model was first suggested by walton and polacheck 1959 it considers the dynamic effects as it concentrates mass and external loads to the nodes which are connected by massless springs however for a system with multiple mooring lines the lumped mass model appears inopportune for programming ma et al 2015 therefore with these disadvantages in mind the finite element method fem based mooring line model is adopted in this study traditionally the dynamic motion of the floating body such as the floating crane has been analyzed by many researchers based on the multibody dynamics for this purpose simulation tools are developed for dynamic analysis of the shipbuilding and offshore operation processes ham et al 2015 park et al 2016 in these programs modeling of the mooring line is simply suggested using the massless spring or analytical catenary model which is not appropriate for dynamic analysis therefore in this study we suggested the fem based mooring line model applicable to the multibody system using the flexible multibody dynamics the mooring line was modeled with a group of flexible beam elements which are connected to a floating body and the seabed with ball joints 1 2 related works there are various studies on the dynamic analysis of the moored floating bodies they are compared in table 1 tang et al 2011 investigated the dynamic behavior of the dual pontoon floating structure using a massless spring model for the mooring lines the massless spring model is not appropriate in the case of the catenary mooring system as it neglects the weight of the mooring line nevertheless it has some advantages such as being easily adapted to a multibody system and reducing the simulation cost ham et al 2017a b developed the safety evaluation program for the mega floating crane based on the multibody dynamics he adopted the massless spring model for the taut mooring line and the analytic catenary model for the catenary mooring line here the contact between the mooring line and the seabed is considered for the analytic catenary model as mentioned in 1 1 this model only considers the static load on the mooring line due to its weight gobat and grosenbaugh 2006 described the numerical features of the cable structures for the static and dynamic simulation the discretization scheme based on finite differences is used to model the mooring line the finite difference is distinguished from the lumped mass method by using an infinitesimally small differential element rather than a finite discrete element several studies have focused on mooring line analysis based on fem guti√©rrez romero et al 2016 presented the non linear dynamic fem mooring model to analyze the response of moored floating wind turbine the interaction with seabed is considered using a spring damper system then the suggested model is validated against several experimental results kim et al 2013 analyzed the behavior of the catenary mooring line considering elastic deformation employing fem using different models for the mooring line such as the linear spring researchers then compared the motion of the floating body and the mooring line however the fem models in most studies are not applicable to the multibody system as the floating body was considered as a single body more recently jeong et al 2017 suggested the fem based mooring line model which applies to the multibody system he used linear beam elements to model the mooring line and also considered the stretching of the mooring line to consider contact with the seabed the linear springs are adopted that connect each node of the mooring line and the seabed in this study the equation of motion of the floating body and the mooring line was solved separately therefore an iteration process is required to match the boundary condition between the floating body and the mooring line at every time interval which leads to very high simulation costs in this study the fem based mooring line was suggested for the multibody system using a 3rd order shape function for the beam elements both stretching and bending of the mooring line were considered the contact with the seabed was modeled using the constraints then the equations of motion of the floating body and the mooring lines were formulated together for a fully coupled analysis the remainder of this paper is presented as follows in section 2 the theoretical background for coupled analysis using the suggested model are presented then the model is verified with an analytic solution and commercial software in section 3 section 4 investigates the simulation results of various applications section 5 summarizes this study and discuss future works 2 theoretical background for coupled analysis for modeling and simulation of a floating crane and the mooring system the main issues are presented in fig 1 first for the motion analysis of the floating crane and the mooring system the multibody dynamics including the flexible body should be considered then the initial equilibrium position of the mooring line needs to be predicted before simulation to consider the contact between the mooring line and the seabed the contact constraints are included in a multibody formulation moreover the friction between them should also be considered finally external forces such as the current force should be calculated in the following sections the theoretical background for each issue will be described 2 1 flexible multibody dynamics multibody dynamics is a discipline describing the dynamic behavior of mechanical systems that consist of multiple bodies connected via joints which represents a kinematic constraint between two bodies the body can be divided into a rigid and flexible body depending on whether it is deformable in this study the mooring line is modeled as a flexible body connected with ball joints and a contact constraint to the floating crane and the seabed as shown in fig 2 the flexible multibody system which is composed of both rigid and flexible bodies can be divided into linearly and nonlinearly elastic multibody systems bauchau 2010 for the linearly elastic system it is assumed that the strain of the flexible bodies is very small and that it has a linear relationship with the displacement at all times for the nonlinearly elastic system the strain can become large or there can be a nonlinear relationship with displacement the mechanical system that contains the mooring lines can be regarded as a nonlinearly elastic multibody system as the flexible bodies have large deformations for this purpose the absolute nodal coordinate formulation ancf well described by berzeri and shabana 2000 and shabana 2005 is adopted for the flexible body 2 1 1 equations of motion for multibody system in the multibody system the joints connecting two bodies impose restrictions on the relative motion of each body a joint can be defined as a kinematic constraint between two bodies which can be described by algebraic constraint equations that constrain some degrees of freedom of the body featherstone 2008 nikravesh 1988 generally the floating crane consists of several rigid bodies connected to each other with various joints the configuration of the floating crane lifting a block and the joints are shown in fig 3 as presented the booms and the floating barge and each hook and each equalizer are connected by hinge joints other bodies are connected to each other with wire ropes or fixed joints to set up the equations of motion to describe the motions of the bodies the constraint equations of each joint should be defined if the constraints between two bodies are violated the resultant forces are exerted to each body to satisfy the constraints in 3 dimensional space a rigid body has 6 degrees of freedom 3 translational and 3 rotational motions about x y and z axes if the body is connected to the joint the joints restrain the motion of the body by lower degrees of freedom as shown in fig 3 the hinge joint allows the relative rotational motion about one axis which means it constrains every translational motion and rotational motions about other two axes the fixed joint restrains every relative motion between two bodies the ball joints which connect the mooring lines and the floating barge allow only rotational motions about every axis between them the constraint equations of every possible joints and their derivatives are well described in ham et al 2015 for the motion analysis the discrete euler lagrange equation dele derived by wendlandt and marsden 1997 marsden and west 2001 lew 2003 lacoursi√®re 2007 and ham et al 2015 is adopted the final form of the dele for rigid bodies is expressed as follows 1 m g k t g k Œ≥ 4 Œµ h 2 v k 1 Œª k 1 m v k h v q k h f q k v k 4 Œ≥ h g k Œ≥ g k v k where h is the time step m is the mass matrix v is the generalized velocity q is the generalized coordinate v is the potential energy g k is the constraint equations g k is the constraint jacobian Œª is lagrange multiplier Œµ is the regularization terms and Œ≥ is the stabilization terms the displacements and rotations can be obtained using following equations 2 v k 1 r k 1

coupling effect of the rigid bodies of the floating crane we compared the motion of the floating crane and the block with the single body model as shown in fig 4 in case 2 the floating crane is regarded as a single body the breadth width and depth of the floating barge is 183 m 70 m and 11 m respectively and the weight of the block is 5000 ton the water depth is 25 m and the wave condition is set to be 2 m height with a period of 10 s the motion of the barge and block of each case can be obtained as presented in fig 5 and fig 6 because of the motion of the booms connected to the floating barge with hinge joints and the relative motion of the hooks and equalizers the motion of the barge and the block in two cases show obvious differences due to the coupling effect the relative motion between bodies can affect the whole system for the accurate motion analysis the floating crane should be modeled as a multibody system which is more realistic 2 1 2 kinematic description of a beam the mooring line can be modeled as a set of ancf beam elements connected to the floating barge in ancf the nodal coordinates and slope are defined in the inertial frame these nodal coordinates are used with a global shape function that has a complete set of rigid body modes therefore the global position vector of an arbitrary point on the beam can be described by using the global shape function s and the absolute nodal coordinates e to describe an ancf beam information is required about the displacement and the slope at each node as shown in fig 7 absolute nodal coordinates e can be expressed by displacement node vectors r 0 r 1 and slope vectors r 0 r l at displacement nodes finally the global position vector of an arbitrary point on the beam can be written as 3 r x s e s 1 i s 2 i s 3 i s 4 i r 0 r 0 r l r l 0 x l i is a 3 3 identity matrix and i s i 1 2 3 and 4 are hermite shape functions defined as 4 s 1 Œæ 1 3 Œæ 2 2 Œæ 3 s 2 Œæ l Œæ 2 Œæ 2 Œæ 3 s 3 Œæ 3 Œæ 2 2 Œæ 3 s 4 Œæ l Œæ 3 Œæ 2 where Œæ x l l is the length of the beam and x is the parameter of the arc length of the beam defined from 0 to l the hermite shape function interpolates the beam as a cubic polynomial other details about ancf including the mass matrix m and the stiffness matrix k l k t due to the longitudinal and the transversal deformations are well described by berzeri and shabana 2000 2 1 3 kinematic constraint between a beam and a rigid body the constraint equations between an ancf beam and a rigid body are presented by ham et al 2017a to formulate the kinematic constraints between a beam and a rigid body we define the generalized coordinate of a beam and a rigid body as 5 q r 0 i r 0 i r l i r l i r g Œ∏ g t as mentioned before the mooring lines are modeled to be connected to the floating barge and the seabed with ball joints to make a ball joint the end node position of the ith beam should coincide with the designated point on the rigid body as shown in fig 8 this relation can be expressed by 6 g t r 3 r l i r g r Œ∏ g r b 0 where r Œ∏ g is the rotation matrix which transforms the local vector into the global vector the constraint jacobian matrix is obtained as 7 g b a l l g t r 3 q 0 i 0 0 i r Œ∏ g r b based on the kinematic description of the beam element and the constraint jacobian matrix the kinetic and strain energy can be derived finally the equations of motion of the flexible multibody system can be obtained from the euler lagrange equation the equations of motion for the multibody system including rigid and flexible bodies are as follows 8 m r i g i

v k 4 Œ≥ 2 h g k Œ≥ 2 g k v k 2 2 calculation of initial position for modeling of the mooring line the initial position and the orientation of each node should be defined before the simulation simply put the mooring line can be modeled as a straight line connecting two points with no initial deflection however if the mooring line is modeled as a straight line buckling may occur instantaneously at the initial stage this is because of the large compressive stress at the beginning as the unstretched length of the mooring line is much longer than the length of the straight line furthermore it takes a long time to find the equilibrium state therefore to find the static equilibrium shape of the mooring line we adopted the analytical catenary model the analytical catenary model calculates the profile and the tension of the catenary mooring line with two given endpoints i e total unstretched length and the weight per unit length the elastic stiffness is neglected based on the force equilibrium equations and shape information the following equation is obtained ronen 1997 smith 1982 9 b q 2 t h sinh b q 2 t h b s 2 h 2 0 b x 2 x 1 h y 2 y 1 where b h is the horizontal and vertical length respectively s is the total unstretched length q is the weight per unit length and t h is the horizontal tension the horizontal tension can be obtained by solving eq 9 then the catenary profile of the mooring line can be obtained meanwhile in the real world part of the mooring line is laid on the seabed as in fig 9 therefore considering the mooring length on the seabed we can get the final equation eq 10 10 l a r c t h q cosh 1 q t h h 1 s a r c t h q sinh q l a r c t h l s e a b e d b l a r c 2 3 seabed interaction during the simulation the interaction between the mooring line and the seabed should be considered as the end of the mooring line is laid on the seabed moreover the friction between them plays an important role to keep the position of the floating body under the current in this part the contact constraints of the mooring line and the seabed are formulated and the friction between them are introduced in a model 2 3 1 contact with seabed existing studies gobat and grosenbaugh 2006 kim et al 2013 guti√©rrez romero et al 2016 jeong et al 2017 modeled the contact between the mooring line and the seabed by using the linear springs connecting each node and the seabed however this method is not appropriate for the elements using a 3rd order shape function as the springs only restrain the vertical position of each node of the mooring line buckling between the nodes can occur as shown in fig 10 in this study we suggested two constraints to model the contact the non interpenetration constraint and the slope constraint as presented in fig 11 the non interpenetration constraint restrains the vertical position of each node as in the existing method the slope constraint restrains the slope of each element in the z direction with these constraints the buckling problem in the existing method can be solved the constraint equations can be derived as follows fig 12 shows the flexible body a which is the mooring line and the seabed b the normal vector of the seabed plane is given as n for the non interpenetration condition the distance of the perpendicular line between the two bodies pq should be positive then the constraint equation g 1 can be derived as in eq 11 the position vector of the point p can be obtained using the shape function and the nodal coordinates 11 g 1 n e h r p c n e r e p f l e x i b l e r e c n e s Œæ q a r e b r e c b r e b b n s Œæ q a r e b r e b r b c secondly if the contact occurs at the point p the z component of the slope vector at the contact point should be zero this means that the slope vector of point p should be perpendicular to the normal vector of the seabed see fig 13 therefore the slope constraint equation g 2 is derived as 12 g 2 v e p n e s Œæ q n e v e p d s d Œæ q s Œæ r e n 3 v e n 3 r e n 4 v e n 4 the slope vector at point p can be obtained using a derivation of the shape function and the nodal coordinates in the existing contact model the contacts between the mooring line and the seabed are regarded as the external forces exerted by the springs however to include the constraint equations to the discrete euler lagrange equation the jacobian matrix of two constraints needs to be calculated the jacobian matrix of each constraint can be derived as follows 13 g 1 q g 1 q e a g 1 r e b g 1 œâ e b t s Œæ t n e n e s Œæ q r e b n e t n e s t Œæ n e t s Œæ q r e b t n e g a n 2 n 3

flexible body using a 3rd order shape function fig 14 compares the profile of the mooring line by adopting the existing and the suggested contact model with the seabed the existing model shows the buckling especially at the end of the part of the mooring line on the seabed due to the slope constraint the mooring line on the seabed is stretched in the suggested model here the connected floating body is assumed to be fixed meanwhile as the seabed is not a rigid body in the real world the mooring line can penetrate inside the seabed the penetration depth varies according to the property of the material and the composition of the seabed in the existing simulations the stiffness of the seabed is generally given as an input to consider the material property of the seabed likewise although the contact between the mooring line and the seabed is expressed as constraint equations they can be violated according to the property of the seabed in the final form of the discrete euler lagrange equation with constraints eq 1 the regularization term Œµ determines how strongly the constraints should be satisfied Œµ has the same value with the inverse number of the spring stiffness in the existing model therefore the stiffness of the seabed can be considered as the input data in the suggested model 2 3 2 friction model the frictional force between the mooring line and the seabed has a great influence on the behavior of the mooring line the frictional force on the seabed has been studied for a long time by many researchers the coulomb friction model using the static and the dynamic friction coefficient has been widely adopted however as the friction coefficient has been proven to be the function of the relative velocity between two bodies by bowden and tabor 2001 the modified coulomb friction model was introduced the modified coulomb friction model has been used in various types of commercial software with the advantages of numerical stability and the efficiency nevertheless the model has a problem in that it cannot realize sticking and slow slippage always occurs between bodies with constant velocities with these disadvantages choi and yoo 2012 suggested a friction model realize stick using the concept of elastic deformation of the body as presented in fig 15 in this model the sticking is modeled using the spring damper system the stick stiffness can be obtained using the elastic deformation limit of the object as the relative displacement between two bodies exceeds the elastic deformation limit sliding occurs 2 4 external loads the current force is one of the main external loads exerted on the mooring line in the water to calculate the current force of a moving body the morison equation morison et al 1950 is adopted 15 f œÅ v u œÅ c a v u v 1 2 œÅ c d a u v u v here c a and c d are the added mass and drag coefficient v is the volume and a is the cross sectional area of the body and u and v are the speed of the current and the body respectively the speed of the current u is the function of the water depth according to iec 61400 3 2009 if the current speed at the surface is given the profile of the velocity can be expressed as 16 u z u 0 z d d 1 7 where d is the total depth of the water which is positive and z is the height which is negative in downward direction the current speed on the seabed becomes zero to calculate the total current force exerted on a flexible beam element the distributed force is integrated along the element the distributed current force per unit length is as follows d is the diameter of the beam element 17 w œÅ c a 1 4 œÄ d 2 v 1 2 œÅ c d d u v u v to calculate the total current force exerted on the flexible beam element the distributed force is integrated along the element the distributed current force per unit length is as follows d is the diameter of the beam element the current force can be divided into the added mass force and the drag force each force can be expressed as eq 18 and eq 19 for simplicity of the calculation of the damping force the velocity of one element is assumed to be constant at every point the steady current flow is considered 18 q a d d e d 0 1 d q a d d e d

d u v 2 l s t 1 2 œÅ c d d u v 2 l with the calculated current force the motion of the mooring line is obtained under the current with or without the frictional force at the seabed the current speed is 2 0 m s at the surface and the barge is assumed to be fixed to space the static and sliding friction coefficients are 0 98 and 0 74 same as in section 2 3 the results are shown in figs 16 and 17 as shown in these figures the frictional force between the seabed and the mooring line plays an important role in case of an existing current the deflection of the mooring line to the current direction is 17 3 m and 12 8 m respectively for each case in case 2 the mooring line on the seabed does not move due to the friction the tension of the mooring line increases with the application of the current the maximum value is 40 tons and 38 tons for each case respectively 3 verification before applying the suggested mooring line model to real cases we compared the simulation results with an analytic solution and commercial software for the verification 3 1 convergence test to determine the number of the beam elements consisting of the mooring line the convergence test is performed with a different number of elements the tension of the mooring line at the fairlead and the length of the mooring line on the seabed is analyzed the property of the mooring line is presented in table 2 both ends of the mooring line are fixed and the vertical and horizontal distance between them is 100 m and 26 m the result is shown in fig 18 the length of the seabed is almost the same with a different number of elements however the tension at the end starts to converge as the number of the elements is more than 40 3 2 comparison with analytic solution to verify the accuracy of the suggested model the analytic solution is used the analytic solution derived in eq 9 calculates the profile of the catenary mooring line due to its weight as the elasticity of the mooring line is not considered in an analytic solution the unstretchable mooring line is used for the comparison the properties of the mooring line are adopted with reference of kim et al 2010 the horizontal length between two ends of the mooring line is 1000 m and the angle of the slope between two ends is selected as 0 15 30 and 45 deg respectively the length of the mooring line is 1026 m fig 19 shows the result as shown in fig 19 the profile of the mooring line is the same with the analytic solution at different slope angles if the non dimensional axial stiffness of the mooring line is given from 1 to 300 the profile of the mooring line is changed as shown in fig 20 as the axial stiffness gets smaller the deflection becomes bigger 3 3 comparison with commercial software through the comparison with the analytic solution we verified the profile of the mooring line due to its weight however in real cases the axial stiffness of the mooring line cannot be neglected moreover the interaction with the seabed should be considered to verify the tension and the profile of the mooring line therefore the results from the commercial software orcaflex is adopted for the verification orcaflex has widely used the program in the field of ocean engineering especially for mooring analysis with this program the length of the seabed tension at the fairlead and the embedded depth of the mooring line are compared fig 21 below shows the configuration of the test cases the water depth and the length of the mooring line are selected as 25 8 m and 111 0 m and 50 0 m and 126 8 m for each case the number of elements is assumed to be 100 with the same input data including the total length of the mooring line the other values are obtained the axial stiffness of the mooring line is set to be 61 560 kn to find the equilibrium state the energy dissipated method which applies large damping force at the initial stage is adopted for both cases as presented in table 3 the results are almost the same with the error below 1 4 application the theoretical background of the mooring line model and its verification are described in section 2 and 3 for the application of the suggested model to the multibody system the behavior of the floating crane lifting a block and its mooring system under the irregular wave and current are analyzed the configuration of the floating crane and its mooring system are shown in fig 22 the weight per length of the mooring line is 203 9 kg m and the axial stiffness is 205 200 kn the breadth width and depth of the floating barge is 183 m 70 m and 11 m respectively the water depth is 25 m four mooring lines m1 to m4 are connected to the floating crane and the block is connected to the boom of the floating crane with wire ropes hooks and equalizers the hook and the equalizer are connected by a hinge joint with different environmental loads such as wave and current two cases are simulated as presented in table 4 to represent the environmental conditions we used the beaufort scale which is an empirical measurement relating the wind speed to the condition of the sea journ√©e and massie 2011 the beaufort number is divided into 12 levels according to wind speed in case 1 the beaufort number 5 is used which represents the moderate condition and 7 in case 2 which represents moderate gale to generate the irregular wave in the time domain the joint north sea wave observation project jonswap spectrum is used under the irregular wave of moderate and gale condition the motion of the floating crane and the tension of the mooring lines are depicted by the graph in fig 23 and fig 24 the motion of the floating barge and the displacement are the biggest in case 2 due to the harsh environment and high current speed the tension of the mooring line shows the same tendency with other cases the maximum tension of the mooring line for each case is 21 3 ton and 46 8 ton respectively 5 conclusions and future works to predict the behavior of a floating body and the mooring system precisely the fem based mooring line model is widely used for the coupled analysis of a multibody system and the mooring lines the equation of motion is formulated using flexible multibody dynamics the mooring line is modeled as multiple flexible beam elements using the ancf and connected to the floating body and the seabed for this purpose the joint between the rigid body and the flexible beam element is derived to model the interaction between the mooring line and the seabed the non interpenetration constraint and the slope constraints are suggested with these constraints the buckling issue from the existing contact model can be resolved also the friction model is adopted to realize the stick with the seabed using commercial software orcaflex the suggested mooring line model is verified by comparison with an analytic solution of a profile of the mooring line as a result the profile of the mooring line is exactly same with the analytic solution and the error between the suggested model and the result from orcaflex is below 1 for the application the floating crane lifting a block is modeled as a multibody system including the fix joint hinge joint and rigid and flexible bodies the motion of the floating crane and the tension of the mooring line is then analyzed under the irregular wave and current condition under the irregular wave of moderate and gale condition the maximum tension of the mooring line could be obtained as 21 3 ton and 46 8 ton each with this result it could be seen that the suggested model can be properly adopted to the multibody system for future studies the suggested mooring line model will be adopted to various operations of the floating crane and the offshore platforms moreover we will focus on the improvement of the performance of the simulation to reduce the computing time kim et al 2017 acknowledgements this work was partially supported by a bk21 plus education research center for offshore plant engineers cope

position of the floating body using the tension of the mooring lines on the other hand the weight of the mooring lines plays an important role in a catenary mooring system tang et al 2009 analyzed the catenary mooring system and divided it into three types of models i e an analytic catenary model lumped mass model and finite element model the analytic catenary model faltinsen 1993 is a quasi static model which calculates the force exerted by the weight of the mooring line based on a force equilibrium equation therefore dynamic effects due to inertial and drag forces cannot be considered the lumped mass model was first suggested by walton and polacheck 1959 it considers the dynamic effects as it concentrates mass and external loads to the nodes which are connected by massless springs however for a system with multiple mooring lines the lumped mass model appears inopportune for programming ma et al 2015 therefore with these disadvantages in mind the finite element method fem based mooring line model is adopted in this study traditionally the dynamic motion of the floating body such as the floating crane has been analyzed by many researchers based on the multibody dynamics for this purpose simulation tools are developed for dynamic analysis of the shipbuilding and offshore operation processes ham et al 2015 park et al 2016 in these programs modeling of the mooring line is simply suggested using the massless spring or analytical catenary model which is not appropriate for dynamic analysis therefore in this study we suggested the fem based mooring line model applicable to the multibody system using the flexible multibody dynamics the mooring line was modeled with a group of flexible beam elements which are connected to a floating body and the seabed with ball joints 1 2 related works there are various studies on the dynamic analysis of the moored floating bodies they are compared in table 1 tang et al 2011 investigated the dynamic behavior of the dual pontoon floating structure using a massless spring model for the mooring lines the massless spring model is not appropriate in the case of the catenary mooring system as it neglects the weight of the mooring line nevertheless it has some advantages such as being easily adapted to a multibody system and reducing the simulation cost ham et al 2017a b developed the safety evaluation program for the mega floating crane based on the multibody dynamics he adopted the massless spring model for the taut mooring line and the analytic catenary model for the catenary mooring line here the contact between the mooring line and the seabed is considered for the analytic catenary model as mentioned in 1 1 this model only considers the static load on the mooring line due to its weight gobat and grosenbaugh 2006 described the numerical features of the cable structures for the static and dynamic simulation the discretization scheme based on finite differences is used to model the mooring line the finite difference is distinguished from the lumped mass method by using an infinitesimally small differential element rather than a finite discrete element several studies have focused on mooring line analysis based on fem guti√©rrez romero et al 2016 presented the non linear dynamic fem mooring model to analyze the response of moored floating wind turbine the interaction with seabed is considered using a spring damper system then the suggested model is validated against several experimental results kim et al 2013 analyzed the behavior of the catenary mooring line considering elastic deformation employing fem using different models for the mooring line such as the linear spring researchers then compared the motion of the floating body and the mooring line however the fem models in most studies are not applicable to the multibody system as the floating body was considered as a single body more recently jeong et al 2017 suggested the fem based mooring line model which applies to the multibody system he used linear beam elements to model the mooring line and also considered the stretching of the mooring line to consider contact with the seabed the linear springs are adopted that connect each node of the mooring line and the seabed in this study the equation of motion of the floating body and the mooring line was solved separately therefore an iteration process is required to match the boundary condition between the floating body and the mooring line at every time interval which leads to very high simulation costs in this study the fem based mooring line was suggested for the multibody system using a 3rd order shape function for the beam elements both stretching and bending of the mooring line were considered the contact with the seabed was modeled using the constraints then the equations of motion of the floating body and the mooring lines were formulated together for a fully coupled analysis the remainder of this paper is presented as follows in section 2 the theoretical background for coupled analysis using the suggested model are presented then the model is verified with an analytic solution and commercial software in section 3 section 4 investigates the simulation results of various applications section 5 summarizes this study and discuss future works 2 theoretical background for coupled analysis for modeling and simulation of a floating crane and the mooring system the main issues are presented in fig 1 first for the motion analysis of the floating crane and the mooring system the multibody dynamics including the flexible body should be considered then the initial equilibrium position of the mooring line needs to be predicted before simulation to consider the contact between the mooring line and the seabed the contact constraints are included in a multibody formulation moreover the friction between them should also be considered finally external forces such as the current force should be calculated in the following sections the theoretical background for each issue will be described 2 1 flexible multibody dynamics multibody dynamics is a discipline describing the dynamic behavior of mechanical systems that consist of multiple bodies connected via joints which represents a kinematic constraint between two bodies the body can be divided into a rigid and flexible body depending on whether it is deformable in this study the mooring line is modeled as a flexible body connected with ball joints and a contact constraint to the floating crane and the seabed as shown in fig 2 the flexible multibody system which is composed of both rigid and flexible bodies can be divided into linearly and nonlinearly elastic multibody systems bauchau 2010 for the linearly elastic system it is assumed that the strain of the flexible bodies is very small and that it has a linear relationship with the displacement at all times for the nonlinearly elastic system the strain can become large or there can be a nonlinear relationship with displacement the mechanical system that contains the mooring lines can be regarded as a nonlinearly elastic multibody system as the flexible bodies have large deformations for this purpose the absolute nodal coordinate formulation ancf well described by berzeri and shabana 2000 and shabana 2005 is adopted for the flexible body 2 1 1 equations of motion for multibody system in the multibody system the joints connecting two bodies impose restrictions on the relative motion of each body a joint can be defined as a kinematic constraint between two bodies which can be described by algebraic constraint equations that constrain some degrees of freedom of the body featherstone 2008 nikravesh 1988 generally the floating crane consists of several rigid bodies connected to each other with various joints the configuration of the floating crane lifting a block and the joints are shown in fig 3 as presented the booms and the floating barge and each hook and each equalizer are connected by hinge joints other bodies are connected to each other with wire ropes or fixed joints to set up the equations of motion to describe the motions of the bodies the constraint equations of each joint should be defined if the constraints between two bodies are violated the resultant forces are exerted to each body to satisfy the constraints in 3 dimensional space a rigid body has 6 degrees of freedom 3 translational and 3 rotational motions about x y and z axes if the body is connected to the joint the joints restrain the motion of the body by lower degrees of freedom as shown in fig 3 the hinge joint allows the relative rotational motion about one axis which means it constrains every translational motion and rotational motions about other two axes the fixed joint restrains every relative motion between two bodies the ball joints which connect the mooring lines and the floating barge allow only rotational motions about every axis between them the constraint equations of every possible joints and their derivatives are well described in ham et al 2015 for the motion analysis the discrete euler lagrange equation dele derived by wendlandt and marsden 1997 marsden and west 2001 lew 2003 lacoursi√®re 2007 and ham et al 2015 is adopted the final form of the dele for rigid bodies is expressed as follows 1 m g k t g k Œ≥ 4 Œµ h 2 v k 1 Œª k 1 m v k h v q k h f q k v k 4 Œ≥ h g k Œ≥ g k v k where h is the time step m is the mass matrix v is the generalized velocity q is the generalized coordinate v is the potential energy g k is the constraint equations g k is the constraint jacobian Œª is lagrange multiplier Œµ is the regularization terms and Œ≥ is the stabilization terms the displacements and rotations can be obtained using following equations 2 v k 1 r k 1

coupling effect of the rigid bodies of the floating crane we compared the motion of the floating crane and the block with the single body model as shown in fig 4 in case 2 the floating crane is regarded as a single body the breadth width and depth of the floating barge is 183 m 70 m and 11 m respectively and the weight of the block is 5000 ton the water depth is 25 m and the wave condition is set to be 2 m height with a period of 10 s the motion of the barge and block of each case can be obtained as presented in fig 5 and fig 6 because of the motion of the booms connected to the floating barge with hinge joints and the relative motion of the hooks and equalizers the motion of the barge and the block in two cases show obvious differences due to the coupling effect the relative motion between bodies can affect the whole system for the accurate motion analysis the floating crane should be modeled as a multibody system which is more realistic 2 1 2 kinematic description of a beam the mooring line can be modeled as a set of ancf beam elements connected to the floating barge in ancf the nodal coordinates and slope are defined in the inertial frame these nodal coordinates are used with a global shape function that has a complete set of rigid body modes therefore the global position vector of an arbitrary point on the beam can be described by using the global shape function s and the absolute nodal coordinates e to describe an ancf beam information is required about the displacement and the slope at each node as shown in fig 7 absolute nodal coordinates e can be expressed by displacement node vectors r 0 r 1 and slope vectors r 0 r l at displacement nodes finally the global position vector of an arbitrary point on the beam can be written as 3 r x s e s 1 i s 2 i s 3 i s 4 i r 0 r 0 r l r l 0 x l i is a 3 3 identity matrix and i s i 1 2 3 and 4 are hermite shape functions defined as 4 s 1 Œæ 1 3 Œæ 2 2 Œæ 3 s 2 Œæ l Œæ 2 Œæ 2 Œæ 3 s 3 Œæ 3 Œæ 2 2 Œæ 3 s 4 Œæ l Œæ 3 Œæ 2 where Œæ x l l is the length of the beam and x is the parameter of the arc length of the beam defined from 0 to l the hermite shape function interpolates the beam as a cubic polynomial other details about ancf including the mass matrix m and the stiffness matrix k l k t due to the longitudinal and the transversal deformations are well described by berzeri and shabana 2000 2 1 3 kinematic constraint between a beam and a rigid body the constraint equations between an ancf beam and a rigid body are presented by ham et al 2017a to formulate the kinematic constraints between a beam and a rigid body we define the generalized coordinate of a beam and a rigid body as 5 q r 0 i r 0 i r l i r l i r g Œ∏ g t as mentioned before the mooring lines are modeled to be connected to the floating barge and the seabed with ball joints to make a ball joint the end node position of the ith beam should coincide with the designated point on the rigid body as shown in fig 8 this relation can be expressed by 6 g t r 3 r l i r g r Œ∏ g r b 0 where r Œ∏ g is the rotation matrix which transforms the local vector into the global vector the constraint jacobian matrix is obtained as 7 g b a l l g t r 3 q 0 i 0 0 i r Œ∏ g r b based on the kinematic description of the beam element and the constraint jacobian matrix the kinetic and strain energy can be derived finally the equations of motion of the flexible multibody system can be obtained from the euler lagrange equation the equations of motion for the multibody system including rigid and flexible bodies are as follows 8 m r i g i

v k 4 Œ≥ 2 h g k Œ≥ 2 g k v k 2 2 calculation of initial position for modeling of the mooring line the initial position and the orientation of each node should be defined before the simulation simply put the mooring line can be modeled as a straight line connecting two points with no initial deflection however if the mooring line is modeled as a straight line buckling may occur instantaneously at the initial stage this is because of the large compressive stress at the beginning as the unstretched length of the mooring line is much longer than the length of the straight line furthermore it takes a long time to find the equilibrium state therefore to find the static equilibrium shape of the mooring line we adopted the analytical catenary model the analytical catenary model calculates the profile and the tension of the catenary mooring line with two given endpoints i e total unstretched length and the weight per unit length the elastic stiffness is neglected based on the force equilibrium equations and shape information the following equation is obtained ronen 1997 smith 1982 9 b q 2 t h sinh b q 2 t h b s 2 h 2 0 b x 2 x 1 h y 2 y 1 where b h is the horizontal and vertical length respectively s is the total unstretched length q is the weight per unit length and t h is the horizontal tension the horizontal tension can be obtained by solving eq 9 then the catenary profile of the mooring line can be obtained meanwhile in the real world part of the mooring line is laid on the seabed as in fig 9 therefore considering the mooring length on the seabed we can get the final equation eq 10 10 l a r c t h q cosh 1 q t h h 1 s a r c t h q sinh q l a r c t h l s e a b e d b l a r c 2 3 seabed interaction during the simulation the interaction between the mooring line and the seabed should be considered as the end of the mooring line is laid on the seabed moreover the friction between them plays an important role to keep the position of the floating body under the current in this part the contact constraints of the mooring line and the seabed are formulated and the friction between them are introduced in a model 2 3 1 contact with seabed existing studies gobat and grosenbaugh 2006 kim et al 2013 guti√©rrez romero et al 2016 jeong et al 2017 modeled the contact between the mooring line and the seabed by using the linear springs connecting each node and the seabed however this method is not appropriate for the elements using a 3rd order shape function as the springs only restrain the vertical position of each node of the mooring line buckling between the nodes can occur as shown in fig 10 in this study we suggested two constraints to model the contact the non interpenetration constraint and the slope constraint as presented in fig 11 the non interpenetration constraint restrains the vertical position of each node as in the existing method the slope constraint restrains the slope of each element in the z direction with these constraints the buckling problem in the existing method can be solved the constraint equations can be derived as follows fig 12 shows the flexible body a which is the mooring line and the seabed b the normal vector of the seabed plane is given as n for the non interpenetration condition the distance of the perpendicular line between the two bodies pq should be positive then the constraint equation g 1 can be derived as in eq 11 the position vector of the point p can be obtained using the shape function and the nodal coordinates 11 g 1 n e h r p c n e r e p f l e x i b l e r e c n e s Œæ q a r e b r e c b r e b b n s Œæ q a r e b r e b r b c secondly if the contact occurs at the point p the z component of the slope vector at the contact point should be zero this means that the slope vector of point p should be perpendicular to the normal vector of the seabed see fig 13 therefore the slope constraint equation g 2 is derived as 12 g 2 v e p n e s Œæ q n e v e p d s d Œæ q s Œæ r e n 3 v e n 3 r e n 4 v e n 4 the slope vector at point p can be obtained using a derivation of the shape function and the nodal coordinates in the existing contact model the contacts between the mooring line and the seabed are regarded as the external forces exerted by the springs however to include the constraint equations to the discrete euler lagrange equation the jacobian matrix of two constraints needs to be calculated the jacobian matrix of each constraint can be derived as follows 13 g 1 q g 1 q e a g 1 r e b g 1 œâ e b t s Œæ t n e n e s Œæ q r e b n e t n e s t Œæ n e t s Œæ q r e b t n e g a n 2 n 3

flexible body using a 3rd order shape function fig 14 compares the profile of the mooring line by adopting the existing and the suggested contact model with the seabed the existing model shows the buckling especially at the end of the part of the mooring line on the seabed due to the slope constraint the mooring line on the seabed is stretched in the suggested model here the connected floating body is assumed to be fixed meanwhile as the seabed is not a rigid body in the real world the mooring line can penetrate inside the seabed the penetration depth varies according to the property of the material and the composition of the seabed in the existing simulations the stiffness of the seabed is generally given as an input to consider the material property of the seabed likewise although the contact between the mooring line and the seabed is expressed as constraint equations they can be violated according to the property of the seabed in the final form of the discrete euler lagrange equation with constraints eq 1 the regularization term Œµ determines how strongly the constraints should be satisfied Œµ has the same value with the inverse number of the spring stiffness in the existing model therefore the stiffness of the seabed can be considered as the input data in the suggested model 2 3 2 friction model the frictional force between the mooring line and the seabed has a great influence on the behavior of the mooring line the frictional force on the seabed has been studied for a long time by many researchers the coulomb friction model using the static and the dynamic friction coefficient has been widely adopted however as the friction coefficient has been proven to be the function of the relative velocity between two bodies by bowden and tabor 2001 the modified coulomb friction model was introduced the modified coulomb friction model has been used in various types of commercial software with the advantages of numerical stability and the efficiency nevertheless the model has a problem in that it cannot realize sticking and slow slippage always occurs between bodies with constant velocities with these disadvantages choi and yoo 2012 suggested a friction model realize stick using the concept of elastic deformation of the body as presented in fig 15 in this model the sticking is modeled using the spring damper system the stick stiffness can be obtained using the elastic deformation limit of the object as the relative displacement between two bodies exceeds the elastic deformation limit sliding occurs 2 4 external loads the current force is one of the main external loads exerted on the mooring line in the water to calculate the current force of a moving body the morison equation morison et al 1950 is adopted 15 f œÅ v u œÅ c a v u v 1 2 œÅ c d a u v u v here c a and c d are the added mass and drag coefficient v is the volume and a is the cross sectional area of the body and u and v are the speed of the current and the body respectively the speed of the current u is the function of the water depth according to iec 61400 3 2009 if the current speed at the surface is given the profile of the velocity can be expressed as 16 u z u 0 z d d 1 7 where d is the total depth of the water which is positive and z is the height which is negative in downward direction the current speed on the seabed becomes zero to calculate the total current force exerted on a flexible beam element the distributed force is integrated along the element the distributed current force per unit length is as follows d is the diameter of the beam element 17 w œÅ c a 1 4 œÄ d 2 v 1 2 œÅ c d d u v u v to calculate the total current force exerted on the flexible beam element the distributed force is integrated along the element the distributed current force per unit length is as follows d is the diameter of the beam element the current force can be divided into the added mass force and the drag force each force can be expressed as eq 18 and eq 19 for simplicity of the calculation of the damping force the velocity of one element is assumed to be constant at every point the steady current flow is considered 18 q a d d e d 0 1 d q a d d e d

d u v 2 l s t 1 2 œÅ c d d u v 2 l with the calculated current force the motion of the mooring line is obtained under the current with or without the frictional force at the seabed the current speed is 2 0 m s at the surface and the barge is assumed to be fixed to space the static and sliding friction coefficients are 0 98 and 0 74 same as in section 2 3 the results are shown in figs 16 and 17 as shown in these figures the frictional force between the seabed and the mooring line plays an important role in case of an existing current the deflection of the mooring line to the current direction is 17 3 m and 12 8 m respectively for each case in case 2 the mooring line on the seabed does not move due to the friction the tension of the mooring line increases with the application of the current the maximum value is 40 tons and 38 tons for each case respectively 3 verification before applying the suggested mooring line model to real cases we compared the simulation results with an analytic solution and commercial software for the verification 3 1 convergence test to determine the number of the beam elements consisting of the mooring line the convergence test is performed with a different number of elements the tension of the mooring line at the fairlead and the length of the mooring line on the seabed is analyzed the property of the mooring line is presented in table 2 both ends of the mooring line are fixed and the vertical and horizontal distance between them is 100 m and 26 m the result is shown in fig 18 the length of the seabed is almost the same with a different number of elements however the tension at the end starts to converge as the number of the elements is more than 40 3 2 comparison with analytic solution to verify the accuracy of the suggested model the analytic solution is used the analytic solution derived in eq 9 calculates the profile of the catenary mooring line due to its weight as the elasticity of the mooring line is not considered in an analytic solution the unstretchable mooring line is used for the comparison the properties of the mooring line are adopted with reference of kim et al 2010 the horizontal length between two ends of the mooring line is 1000 m and the angle of the slope between two ends is selected as 0 15 30 and 45 deg respectively the length of the mooring line is 1026 m fig 19 shows the result as shown in fig 19 the profile of the mooring line is the same with the analytic solution at different slope angles if the non dimensional axial stiffness of the mooring line is given from 1 to 300 the profile of the mooring line is changed as shown in fig 20 as the axial stiffness gets smaller the deflection becomes bigger 3 3 comparison with commercial software through the comparison with the analytic solution we verified the profile of the mooring line due to its weight however in real cases the axial stiffness of the mooring line cannot be neglected moreover the interaction with the seabed should be considered to verify the tension and the profile of the mooring line therefore the results from the commercial software orcaflex is adopted for the verification orcaflex has widely used the program in the field of ocean engineering especially for mooring analysis with this program the length of the seabed tension at the fairlead and the embedded depth of the mooring line are compared fig 21 below shows the configuration of the test cases the water depth and the length of the mooring line are selected as 25 8 m and 111 0 m and 50 0 m and 126 8 m for each case the number of elements is assumed to be 100 with the same input data including the total length of the mooring line the other values are obtained the axial stiffness of the mooring line is set to be 61 560 kn to find the equilibrium state the energy dissipated method which applies large damping force at the initial stage is adopted for both cases as presented in table 3 the results are almost the same with the error below 1 4 application the theoretical background of the mooring line model and its verification are described in section 2 and 3 for the application of the suggested model to the multibody system the behavior of the floating crane lifting a block and its mooring system under the irregular wave and current are analyzed the configuration of the floating crane and its mooring system are shown in fig 22 the weight per length of the mooring line is 203 9 kg m and the axial stiffness is 205 200 kn the breadth width and depth of the floating barge is 183 m 70 m and 11 m respectively the water depth is 25 m four mooring lines m1 to m4 are connected to the floating crane and the block is connected to the boom of the floating crane with wire ropes hooks and equalizers the hook and the equalizer are connected by a hinge joint with different environmental loads such as wave and current two cases are simulated as presented in table 4 to represent the environmental conditions we used the beaufort scale which is an empirical measurement relating the wind speed to the condition of the sea journ√©e and massie 2011 the beaufort number is divided into 12 levels according to wind speed in case 1 the beaufort number 5 is used which represents the moderate condition and 7 in case 2 which represents moderate gale to generate the irregular wave in the time domain the joint north sea wave observation project jonswap spectrum is used under the irregular wave of moderate and gale condition the motion of the floating crane and the tension of the mooring lines are depicted by the graph in fig 23 and fig 24 the motion of the floating barge and the displacement are the biggest in case 2 due to the harsh environment and high current speed the tension of the mooring line shows the same tendency with other cases the maximum tension of the mooring line for each case is 21 3 ton and 46 8 ton respectively 5 conclusions and future works to predict the behavior of a floating body and the mooring system precisely the fem based mooring line model is widely used for the coupled analysis of a multibody system and the mooring lines the equation of motion is formulated using flexible multibody dynamics the mooring line is modeled as multiple flexible beam elements using the ancf and connected to the floating body and the seabed for this purpose the joint between the rigid body and the flexible beam element is derived to model the interaction between the mooring line and the seabed the non interpenetration constraint and the slope constraints are suggested with these constraints the buckling issue from the existing contact model can be resolved also the friction model is adopted to realize the stick with the seabed using commercial software orcaflex the suggested mooring line model is verified by comparison with an analytic solution of a profile of the mooring line as a result the profile of the mooring line is exactly same with the analytic solution and the error between the suggested model and the result from orcaflex is below 1 for the application the floating crane lifting a block is modeled as a multibody system including the fix joint hinge joint and rigid and flexible bodies the motion of the floating crane and the tension of the mooring line is then analyzed under the irregular wave and current condition under the irregular wave of moderate and gale condition the maximum tension of the mooring line could be obtained as 21 3 ton and 46 8 ton each with this result it could be seen that the suggested model can be properly adopted to the multibody system for future studies the suggested mooring line model will be adopted to various operations of the floating crane and the offshore platforms moreover we will focus on the improvement of the performance of the simulation to reduce the computing time kim et al 2017 acknowledgements this work was partially supported by a bk21 plus education research center for offshore plant engineers cope

23261,it is generally assumed in dynamic positioning of over actuated marine vessels that the control effectiveness matrix input matrix is known and constant or in case of fault information it is estimated by the fault detection and diagnosis system the purpose of the study is to develop the adaptive dynamic positioning control system for an over actuated marine vessel in the presence of uncertainties and with emphasis on limited information about thruster forces the proposed approach bases on the mimo adaptive backstepping method to design the high level control law and then to give inputs to the control allocation unit an adaptive solution allows to accommodate the unknown time varying control effectiveness matrix and to update the thrust distribution due to actuator losses and failures the effectiveness and correctness of the proposed control schema is demonstrated by simulations involving a redundant set of actuators when some of them have lost partially their efficiency or failed the evaluation criteria include energy consumption robustness and accuracy of dynamic positioning during typical vessel operations based on simulation tests results the generated control inputs stabilize the ship position and orientation violated by thruster faults keywords backstepping control allocation over actuated system thruster faults dynamic positioning 1 introduction ship motion control at low speed includes dynamic positioning dp the main goal of which is to maintain ship position and heading in the presence of environmental disturbances this task is performed through ship motion control in three degrees of freedom using active thrusters and propellers which can generate forces and moments in different directions of motion a survey of selected major research and technology advances in the field of dynamic positioning is summarized in sorensen 2011 in the dp system actuator settings are determined based on the signal passed from the dp controller high level controller and the control allocation system the dp controller controls three degrees of freedom of ship motion which are sway surge and yaw motion based on the information on these motion components it generates the set values of forces and moment for the control allocation ca system in the ca system the vector of forces and moment is distributed into actuators and transformed to signals controlling actuator settings i e rotational speeds of main propulsion propellers and azimuthal and tunnel rudders rudder deflection angles adjustable propeller blades in modern dp vessels the total number of control inputs exceeds the total number of controlled degrees of freedom so the type of over actuated control takes place the exact number of control inputs may differ depending on tasks performed by the dp ship dp classes ship size and economic conditions the ca system takes into account physical constraints of rudder and propulsion operation e g input saturation and rate constraints steering and propulsion efficiency configuration as well as constraints resulting from current amount of electric and mechanical power available on the ship a solution is searched which will allow to obtain minimal energy losses and wear of actuators when executing the basic goal of control which is precise ship positioning a detailed overview of the existing control allocation methods can be found in bodson 2002 johansen and fossen 2013 the control allocation problem is mostly viewed as a static or quasi dynamic optimization problem that is solved independently of the dynamic control problem considering non adaptive linear effector models and neglecting the actuator dynamics the simplest of the presented solutions consist in calculating a pseudo inverse matrix and the use of classical optimization methods such as the lagrange method or the least square method to minimise the activity of the actuators more complicated solutions consist of numerous optimization methods to take into account constraints connected with saturation of actuators penalty function bodson 2002 direct allocation da method redistributed pseudo inverse rpi method oppenheimer et al 2006 cascading generalized inverse cgi lindegaard and fossen 2003 the linear actuator dynamics is considered by using model predictive control allocation mpca hanger et al 2011 luo et al 2004 2007 oppenheimer et al 2004 however control allocation ca algorithms do not usually provide robustness to uncertainties in the control effectiveness matrix which is of basic importance for practical applications especially during actuator failure the uncertainties result from actuator configuration and thrust losses which depend on environmental conditions water density ship velocity and actuator faults it is generally assumed for a dp vessel that the control effectiveness matrix input matrix is known and constant without any regard how the control effectiveness matrix will change in time states and inputs in the case of actuator fault information the control effectiveness matrix is usually estimated by the fault detection and diagnosis fdd systems which are strongly committed to the fault tolerant control strategy fault tolerant ft approaches addressed to dp control system have been recently proposed by benetazzo et al 2015 lin and du 2016 zhang and yang 2017 su et al 2017 the disadvantage of these approaches is that they require the fault detection and isolation mechanism to be included directly in the control law formulation another way to reduce the effect of thrust losses is using adaptive dynamic control allocation strategy this approach to designing dp systems was presented in the literature by tj√∏nn√•s and johansen 2005 2007 2008 in those papers instead of optimizing the control allocation at each time instant a dynamic approach was considered by constructing update laws that represent asymptotically optimal allocation search and adaptation formulated based on the lagrangian function and the lyapunov theory this paper presents a design of adaptive dynamic control allocation for an over actuated dynamic positioning vessel based on the adaptive vectorial backstepping krst√≠c et al 1995 and sequential quadratic programming johansen and fossen 2013 as an alternative formulation to accommodate to thrust uncertainties in our paper the control allocation problem is considered with respect to uncertainty in the control effectiveness matrix as a function of operating point variables backstepping was a widely applied for marine vessels cheng du et al 2013 fossen 2000 tsopelakos and papadopoulos 2017 witkowska and ≈õmierzchalski 2012 witkowska 2013 to ensure the closed loop system to be uniformly ultimately bounded uub compared to conventional methods such as linearization ba≈Ñka et al 2013 lqg sliding mode control tomera 2010 tannuri et al 2010 robust h control katebi et al 1997 fuzzy logic cao et al 2001 and neural nets cao et al 2000 the vectorial adaptive backstepping gives an effective and structured design procedure in a recursive way which however requires very complex computations among other factors this complexity results from repeated analytical calculations of the time derivative of virtual control inputs explosion of terms swaroop et al 2000 mingyu et al 2016 and the accurate knowledge of the regression matrices du et al 2015 xia et al 2016 attempts to use the backstepping algorithm in practical application gave rise to the problems of high output energy and difficult cancellation of nonlinear function which were analysed by zhang et al 2018 for ship course keeping control there are a few methods to simplify the standard backstepping procedure by differentiation of the virtual control law e q lyapunov redesign method tracking differentiators td dynamic surface control dsc and other filtering methods wang and shirinzadeh 2014 wang and wang 2015 however these methods have many limitations despite their simplicity of application a systematic method to choose appropriate gains and filter time constants for a dynamic surface controller has not been fully addressed yet in the literature similarly the order of the differentiator td should also be carefully selected when the estimated disturbances can be directly applied in the backstepping controller most of the papers which aimed at designing dp controllers with the above methods did not take into account the dynamics of the actuators although designed based on standard vectorial adaptive backstepping procedure and sequential quadratic programming the dp control system proposed in the article has not yet been dealt exactly with in such form first the high level motion control based backstepping algorithm is developed to update the commanded forces and moment in the presence of the unknown control effectiveness matrix ship dynamics model parameters and environmental disturbances furthermore the control allocation based sequential quadratic programming was used for actuator force mapping to divide the updated commanded forces and moment into particular commanded settings of actuators and to compensate total actuator faults the relevant element of this structure is a detailed algorithm to estimate the control effectiveness matrix for the proposed dp control system without a priori knowledge of vessel s model parameters and slowly varying disturbances additionally the linear time varying actuator dynamics is taken directly into control law formulation we are also providing some modification when using standard backstepping designing procedure the regression matrix is determined not directly in the ship dynamics model but only at the stage of creating the lyapunov function which significantly simplifies the control law designing procedure next the proposed procedure has ability to accommodate the unknown time varying control effectiveness matrix and to update the thrust distribution due to actuator losses and partial faults additionally it provides robustness in control allocation with respect to uncertainties in the control input matrix as a function of operating point variables the effectiveness and correctness of the proposed control schema is demonstrated in simulations involving a redundant set of actuators when some of them have lost partially their efficiency or failed the evaluation criteria include energy consumption robustness and accuracy of dynamic positioning during typical vessel operation thorough comparisons were made between cgi wls weighted least square and mls minimal least squares algorithms to obtain the best performance of the optimization process simulation tests reveal correct operation of the system high accuracy of control and convergence to the set values the results of simulation tests testify to good stability of system operation within the analysed range of operation points referring to real manoeuvring situations 2 system description and problem

velocity density of water propeller s diameter and revolutions disturbances types of actuators and thrust loss resulting from failure of one of propellers depending on the scale of failure distinction can be made between partial faults and total faults the term partial fault means the state in which the ship retains manoeuvring ability despite the propeller failure this leads to changes of b k matric parameters in the force generation model in that case the proposed adaptation system adapts to the recorded changes deviation from the set limiting values of selected parameters or changes in selected operating conditions are signaled by the alarm system on the other hand when the critical state i e the total fault is reached the safety system disconnects the faulty propeller the information on this state is passed to the control system for instance via fdd systems in the proposed control structure the information that total loss of effectiveness has occurred on the actuators is stored in matrix i matrix i d i a g e 1 e r is introduced to contain the information about the actuator total fault the case e i 1 for the i th actuator indicates the total fault free case while e

performing a basic dynamic positioning task of a ship in such situations as position and heading shift station keeping and stabilization of the system at low speed in the presence of bounded unknown

the minimum norm of actuator activities for different ca algorithms give a proper selection of the ca method makes it possible to reach best distribution of forces into the propulsion system the distribution of forces into the propulsion system can also significantly affect the quality factors of control errors as can be seen from tables 1 and 2 the control allocation objective is satisfied giving suboptimal results due to actuator constraints time quality factors of cgi are much better than those for the remaining algorithms the other quality factors of mls are mostly better than those of cgi and significantly better than those of wls so the further simulation results will be presented by using mls algorithm the simulation results of dps with mls control allocation algorithm are depicted in figs 2 7 for test 1 and figs 8 13 for test 2 the figures present the control performance which confirms its good abilities in the presence of unknown slowly varying model parameters disturbances uncertainties and thruster faults it can be clearly observed in figs 2 4 and table 1 that the proposed algorithm ensures convergence of the position and heading to their desired values in the presence of partial loss of actuator effectiveness the command control forces œÑ c calculated from the adaptive control allocation law are compared in fig 5 with actual forces œÑ generated by ship actuators fig 6 presents the norms of estimates Œ∏ ÀÜ 1 and Œ∏ ÀÜ 3 of controller parameters which change relatively slowly it can be clearly observed that the norms of estimates change within a limited range due to change of ship position and heading or due to environmental disturbances and or partial loss of actuator effectiveness the estimated parameters are almost bounded the bis scaled command actuator signals u c calculated from the mls control allocation algorithm are shown in fig 7 the presented numerical examples demonstrate that the proposed dp adaptive control law is effective and has satisfactory performance also in case of unknown actuator forces these results show that the proposed adaptive control allocation law can maintain the ship position and heading at the desired values with satisfactory performance the simulation results testify to stable behaviour of the system within the analysed range of operation points and disturbances level test 2 is focused on the situation of the total loss of some actuators it can be observed in figs 8 10 and table 2 that convergence of state variables is also ensured in the presence of 1 2 and 3 total actuators failure when analysing figs 11 13 it is noticed that the use of reduced number of actuators leads to the increase of settings of excess actuators to compensate forces and moments needed to generate the required ship motion at the same time the ship position and course track its desired values with satisfactory performance the norms of estimates of controller parameters change relatively slowly this testifies to correct operation of the system with reduced number of actuators 5 conclusions the paper focuses on adaptive dynamic positioning control and allocation design with unknown efficiency matrix and without any information about partial faults illustrative examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and correctness of the proposed approach by involving a redundant set of ship actuators when some actuators have lost their effectiveness or failed based on simulation tests results the presence of redundant control inputs stabilizes the ship position and orientation violated by thruster faults the advantage of this approach is in combining the operation of the dp controller with different types of ca techniques additionally it provides robustness in control allocation with respect to uncertainties in the control input matrix as a function of operating point variables the developed procedure of designing dp control system can be generalized and successfully applied for dp vessels represented by adequate state space model the presented calculations performed using the classical backstepping method are complex however based on the simulation results it can be conclude that they are effective in solving the analysed problem it would be advisable in our research to simplify the standard backstepping procedure by differentiation of the virtual control law and to compare the

23261,it is generally assumed in dynamic positioning of over actuated marine vessels that the control effectiveness matrix input matrix is known and constant or in case of fault information it is estimated by the fault detection and diagnosis system the purpose of the study is to develop the adaptive dynamic positioning control system for an over actuated marine vessel in the presence of uncertainties and with emphasis on limited information about thruster forces the proposed approach bases on the mimo adaptive backstepping method to design the high level control law and then to give inputs to the control allocation unit an adaptive solution allows to accommodate the unknown time varying control effectiveness matrix and to update the thrust distribution due to actuator losses and failures the effectiveness and correctness of the proposed control schema is demonstrated by simulations involving a redundant set of actuators when some of them have lost partially their efficiency or failed the evaluation criteria include energy consumption robustness and accuracy of dynamic positioning during typical vessel operations based on simulation tests results the generated control inputs stabilize the ship position and orientation violated by thruster faults keywords backstepping control allocation over actuated system thruster faults dynamic positioning 1 introduction ship motion control at low speed includes dynamic positioning dp the main goal of which is to maintain ship position and heading in the presence of environmental disturbances this task is performed through ship motion control in three degrees of freedom using active thrusters and propellers which can generate forces and moments in different directions of motion a survey of selected major research and technology advances in the field of dynamic positioning is summarized in sorensen 2011 in the dp system actuator settings are determined based on the signal passed from the dp controller high level controller and the control allocation system the dp controller controls three degrees of freedom of ship motion which are sway surge and yaw motion based on the information on these motion components it generates the set values of forces and moment for the control allocation ca system in the ca system the vector of forces and moment is distributed into actuators and transformed to signals controlling actuator settings i e rotational speeds of main propulsion propellers and azimuthal and tunnel rudders rudder deflection angles adjustable propeller blades in modern dp vessels the total number of control inputs exceeds the total number of controlled degrees of freedom so the type of over actuated control takes place the exact number of control inputs may differ depending on tasks performed by the dp ship dp classes ship size and economic conditions the ca system takes into account physical constraints of rudder and propulsion operation e g input saturation and rate constraints steering and propulsion efficiency configuration as well as constraints resulting from current amount of electric and mechanical power available on the ship a solution is searched which will allow to obtain minimal energy losses and wear of actuators when executing the basic goal of control which is precise ship positioning a detailed overview of the existing control allocation methods can be found in bodson 2002 johansen and fossen 2013 the control allocation problem is mostly viewed as a static or quasi dynamic optimization problem that is solved independently of the dynamic control problem considering non adaptive linear effector models and neglecting the actuator dynamics the simplest of the presented solutions consist in calculating a pseudo inverse matrix and the use of classical optimization methods such as the lagrange method or the least square method to minimise the activity of the actuators more complicated solutions consist of numerous optimization methods to take into account constraints connected with saturation of actuators penalty function bodson 2002 direct allocation da method redistributed pseudo inverse rpi method oppenheimer et al 2006 cascading generalized inverse cgi lindegaard and fossen 2003 the linear actuator dynamics is considered by using model predictive control allocation mpca hanger et al 2011 luo et al 2004 2007 oppenheimer et al 2004 however control allocation ca algorithms do not usually provide robustness to uncertainties in the control effectiveness matrix which is of basic importance for practical applications especially during actuator failure the uncertainties result from actuator configuration and thrust losses which depend on environmental conditions water density ship velocity and actuator faults it is generally assumed for a dp vessel that the control effectiveness matrix input matrix is known and constant without any regard how the control effectiveness matrix will change in time states and inputs in the case of actuator fault information the control effectiveness matrix is usually estimated by the fault detection and diagnosis fdd systems which are strongly committed to the fault tolerant control strategy fault tolerant ft approaches addressed to dp control system have been recently proposed by benetazzo et al 2015 lin and du 2016 zhang and yang 2017 su et al 2017 the disadvantage of these approaches is that they require the fault detection and isolation mechanism to be included directly in the control law formulation another way to reduce the effect of thrust losses is using adaptive dynamic control allocation strategy this approach to designing dp systems was presented in the literature by tj√∏nn√•s and johansen 2005 2007 2008 in those papers instead of optimizing the control allocation at each time instant a dynamic approach was considered by constructing update laws that represent asymptotically optimal allocation search and adaptation formulated based on the lagrangian function and the lyapunov theory this paper presents a design of adaptive dynamic control allocation for an over actuated dynamic positioning vessel based on the adaptive vectorial backstepping krst√≠c et al 1995 and sequential quadratic programming johansen and fossen 2013 as an alternative formulation to accommodate to thrust uncertainties in our paper the control allocation problem is considered with respect to uncertainty in the control effectiveness matrix as a function of operating point variables backstepping was a widely applied for marine vessels cheng du et al 2013 fossen 2000 tsopelakos and papadopoulos 2017 witkowska and ≈õmierzchalski 2012 witkowska 2013 to ensure the closed loop system to be uniformly ultimately bounded uub compared to conventional methods such as linearization ba≈Ñka et al 2013 lqg sliding mode control tomera 2010 tannuri et al 2010 robust h control katebi et al 1997 fuzzy logic cao et al 2001 and neural nets cao et al 2000 the vectorial adaptive backstepping gives an effective and structured design procedure in a recursive way which however requires very complex computations among other factors this complexity results from repeated analytical calculations of the time derivative of virtual control inputs explosion of terms swaroop et al 2000 mingyu et al 2016 and the accurate knowledge of the regression matrices du et al 2015 xia et al 2016 attempts to use the backstepping algorithm in practical application gave rise to the problems of high output energy and difficult cancellation of nonlinear function which were analysed by zhang et al 2018 for ship course keeping control there are a few methods to simplify the standard backstepping procedure by differentiation of the virtual control law e q lyapunov redesign method tracking differentiators td dynamic surface control dsc and other filtering methods wang and shirinzadeh 2014 wang and wang 2015 however these methods have many limitations despite their simplicity of application a systematic method to choose appropriate gains and filter time constants for a dynamic surface controller has not been fully addressed yet in the literature similarly the order of the differentiator td should also be carefully selected when the estimated disturbances can be directly applied in the backstepping controller most of the papers which aimed at designing dp controllers with the above methods did not take into account the dynamics of the actuators although designed based on standard vectorial adaptive backstepping procedure and sequential quadratic programming the dp control system proposed in the article has not yet been dealt exactly with in such form first the high level motion control based backstepping algorithm is developed to update the commanded forces and moment in the presence of the unknown control effectiveness matrix ship dynamics model parameters and environmental disturbances furthermore the control allocation based sequential quadratic programming was used for actuator force mapping to divide the updated commanded forces and moment into particular commanded settings of actuators and to compensate total actuator faults the relevant element of this structure is a detailed algorithm to estimate the control effectiveness matrix for the proposed dp control system without a priori knowledge of vessel s model parameters and slowly varying disturbances additionally the linear time varying actuator dynamics is taken directly into control law formulation we are also providing some modification when using standard backstepping designing procedure the regression matrix is determined not directly in the ship dynamics model but only at the stage of creating the lyapunov function which significantly simplifies the control law designing procedure next the proposed procedure has ability to accommodate the unknown time varying control effectiveness matrix and to update the thrust distribution due to actuator losses and partial faults additionally it provides robustness in control allocation with respect to uncertainties in the control input matrix as a function of operating point variables the effectiveness and correctness of the proposed control schema is demonstrated in simulations involving a redundant set of actuators when some of them have lost partially their efficiency or failed the evaluation criteria include energy consumption robustness and accuracy of dynamic positioning during typical vessel operation thorough comparisons were made between cgi wls weighted least square and mls minimal least squares algorithms to obtain the best performance of the optimization process simulation tests reveal correct operation of the system high accuracy of control and convergence to the set values the results of simulation tests testify to good stability of system operation within the analysed range of operation points referring to real manoeuvring situations 2 system description and problem

velocity density of water propeller s diameter and revolutions disturbances types of actuators and thrust loss resulting from failure of one of propellers depending on the scale of failure distinction can be made between partial faults and total faults the term partial fault means the state in which the ship retains manoeuvring ability despite the propeller failure this leads to changes of b k

selected operating conditions are signaled by the alarm system on the other hand when the critical state i e the total fault is reached the safety system disconnects the faulty propeller the information on this state is passed to the control system for instance via fdd systems in the proposed control structure the information that total loss of effectiveness has occurred on the actuators

then after 557 6 s it changes its heading to 20 deg keeping constant position after 1394 0 s it starts to move towards point c 5 10 20 and after 2230 4 s starts to move towards d 0 10 20 keeping constant heading and after that goes back to point a during the numerical simulations after 139 4 s the vessel was exposed to unmodelled disturbances represented by the bias model 3 and to current disturbances with average current velocity 0 v c 0 2 m s and direction 0 Œ≤ c 40 deg generated by random walk process the initial values of estimated parameters for the controller settings were equal to Œ∏ ÀÜ 1 0 0 8 Œ∏ 1 0 and Œ∏ ÀÜ 3 0 0 8 Œ∏ 3 0 the information under i m is fully known the tests analysed in computer simulations represent the following cases test 1 partial actuator fault test 2 total actuator fault it was assumed during the partial loss of actuator effectiveness fault case that all actuators work so i d i a g 1 1 1 1 1 1 but the control effectiveness matrix is changing for the total loss of actuator effectiveness fault case it was assumed that some actuators failed which was modelled by changes of matrix i test 1 presents the situation when the system adapts to model changes resulting from changes of control effectiveness matrix parameters during test 1 the case without loss of actuator effectiveness and the case with 20 loss and 10 loss of control effectiveness matrix parameters was considered after 278 8 s for the total actuator failure case it was assumed that 1 2 or 3 actuators failed after 278 8 s so i d i a g 1 1 1 0 1 1 i d i a g 1 1 1 0 0 1 or i d i a g 1 1 0 0 0 1 respectively furthermore different numerical ca algorithms with sequential quadratic programming 42 43 were used in the simulation tests for comparison to check the best performance of the optimization process the ca designs included numerical weighted least squares wls and minimal least squares mls which solved the optimization problem using active set algorithms and qr decompositions also the cascaded generalized inverse cgi solutions making use of the moore penrose pseudo inverse matrix in a recursive way were tested harkegard 2004 selected performance indices of the proposed ca algorithm recorded during test 1 and test 2 are summarized in table 1 and table 2 respectively the tables contain such quality factors as the maximum tmax and mean tmean computational time averaged over 30 runs the other factors correspond to the best solution of ca and were scaled by the number of sampling times this quality factors include bis scaled the minimum norm of control allocator Œ∏ ÀÜ 2 i t 1 u c œÑ c 2 the minimum norm of actuator activities u c 2 and the norm of control errors e x 2 e y 2 e œà 2 respectively for x y and œà the minimum norm of control allocator and the minimum norm of actuator activities for different ca algorithms give a proper selection of the ca method makes it possible to reach best distribution of forces into the propulsion system the distribution of forces into the propulsion system can also significantly affect the quality factors of control errors as can be seen from tables 1 and 2 the control allocation objective is satisfied giving suboptimal results due to actuator constraints time quality factors of cgi are much better than those for the remaining algorithms the other quality factors of mls are mostly better than those of cgi and significantly better than those of wls so the further simulation results will be presented by using mls algorithm the simulation results of dps with mls control allocation algorithm are depicted in figs 2 7 for test 1 and figs 8 13 for test 2 the figures present the control performance which confirms its good abilities in the presence of unknown slowly varying model parameters disturbances uncertainties and thruster faults it can be clearly observed in figs 2 4 and table 1 that the proposed algorithm ensures convergence of the position and heading to their desired values in the presence of partial loss of actuator effectiveness the command control forces œÑ c calculated from the adaptive control allocation law are compared in fig 5 with actual forces œÑ generated by ship actuators fig 6 presents the norms of estimates Œ∏ ÀÜ 1 and Œ∏ ÀÜ 3 of controller parameters which change relatively slowly it can be clearly observed that the norms of estimates change within a limited range due to change of ship position and heading or due to environmental disturbances and or partial loss of actuator effectiveness the estimated parameters are almost bounded the bis scaled command actuator signals u c calculated from the mls control allocation algorithm are shown in fig 7 the presented numerical examples demonstrate that the proposed dp adaptive control law is effective and has satisfactory performance also in case of unknown actuator forces these results show that the proposed adaptive control allocation law can maintain the ship position and heading at the desired values with satisfactory performance the simulation results testify to stable behaviour of the system within the analysed range of operation points and disturbances level test 2 is focused on the situation of the total loss of some actuators it can be observed in figs 8 10 and table 2 that convergence of state variables is also ensured in the presence of 1 2 and 3 total actuators failure when analysing figs 11 13 it is noticed that the use of reduced number of actuators leads to the increase of settings of excess actuators to compensate forces and moments needed to generate the required ship motion at the same time the ship position and course track its desired values with satisfactory performance the norms of estimates of controller parameters change relatively slowly this testifies to correct operation of the system with reduced number of actuators 5 conclusions the paper focuses on adaptive dynamic positioning control and allocation design with unknown efficiency matrix and without any information about partial faults illustrative examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and correctness of the proposed approach by involving a redundant set of ship actuators when some actuators have lost their effectiveness or failed based on simulation tests results the presence of redundant control inputs stabilizes the ship position and orientation violated by thruster faults the advantage of this approach is in combining the operation of the dp controller with different types of ca techniques additionally it provides robustness in control allocation with respect to uncertainties in the control input matrix as a function of operating point variables the developed procedure of designing dp control system can be generalized and successfully applied for dp vessels represented by adequate state space model the presented calculations performed using the classical backstepping method are complex however based on the simulation results it can be conclude that they are effective in solving the analysed problem it would be advisable in our research to simplify the standard backstepping procedure by differentiation of the virtual control law and to compare the effectiveness of the adopted concept appendix a supplementary data the following are the supplementary data related to this article fig 2 fig 2 fig 3 fig 3 fig 4 fig 4 fig 5 fig 5 fig 6 fig 6 fig 7

formulas of hydrodynamic coefficients 1 introduction floating offshore wind turbine fowt is a promising innovation the world s first full scale 2 3 mw spar fowt in hywind project was installed in norway by statoil hydro in 2009 hywind demo and the second prototype was the 2 mw semi submersible fowt in windfloat project deployed in portugal by principle power in 2011 windfloat in japan a 2 mw spar fowt in goto fowt project was built off the coast of kabashima in 2013 goto fowt in addition another 2 mw semi submersible fowt and a 7 mw v shape semi submersible fowt in fukushima forward project were completed off the coast of fukushima in 2013 and 2015 respectively fukushima forward in the semi submersible and advanced spar fowts heave plates are commonly used to reduce heave motions and to shift heave resonance periods out of the first order wave energy range lopez pavon and souto iglesias 2015 fukushima forward some new concepts of floating platform have been adopted a substation and a 5 mw fowt constructed in fukushima forward project fukushima forward adopt an advanced spar consisting of multiple heave plates the hydrodynamic characteristics of multiple heave plates is one of the key factors for the structural design of platforms morison s equation and potential theory are widely used to predict hydrodynamic loads on the platform of fowt phuc and ishihara 2007 waris and ishihara 2012 jonkman 2007 browning et al 2014 kvittem et al 2012 the hydrodynamic coefficients namely added mass and drag coefficients of heave plates hereinafter referred to as c a and c d respectively have to be determined to evaluate hydrodynamic loads on them the hydrodynamic coefficients of the heave plates can be attained by means of water tank tests lopez pavon and souto iglesias 2015 li et al 2013 numerical simulations lopez pavon and souto iglesias 2015 tao and thiagarajan 2003a 2003b tao et al 2004 2007 tao and cai 2004 garrido mendoza et al 2015 yang et al 2014 and empirical formulas tao et al 2007 tao and cai 2004 philip et al 2013 water tank tests have been carried out intensively to study the hydrodynamic coefficients of circular single heave plate lopez pavon and souto iglesias 2015 tao and dray 2008 and square single heave plate prislin blevins halkyard 1998 li et al 2013 an and faltinsen 2013 prislin blevins halkyard 1998 wadhwa and thiagarajan 2009 hydrodynamic coefficients of circular and square single heave plates were compared between each other in the study by lopez pavon and souto iglesias 2015 they pointed out that both c a and c d of the square heave plate are smaller than those of the circular heave plate they also confirmed that there is a relatively weak dependence of oscillating frequencies and a large dependence with keulegan carpenter kc number as well documented in references li et al 2013 an and faltinsen 2013 wadhwa et al wadhwa and thiagarajan 2009 wadhwa et al 2010 investigated the hydrodynamic coefficients of a heave plate near the free surface as the submergence of the heave plate decreases the free surface is expected to be disturbed it was observed that both c a and c d continuously increase as the distance to the free surface increases li et al 2013 studied the influence of plates spacing on the hydrodynamic coefficients it was found that the hydrodynamic coefficients decrease as spacing decreases a number of numerical studies on the hydrodynamic characteristics of heave plate have been conducted tao and cai 2004 investigated influences of heave plate diameter and kc number on hydrodynamic coefficients by finite difference method predicted damping ratio agreed well with the measured ones in both low and high kc regimes tao and thiagarajan 2003a 2003b presented three vortex shedding modes for oscillating heave plate and proposed a quantitative method of identifying the vortex shedding flow regimes lopez pavon and souto iglesias 2015 performed a numerical analysis of the hydrodynamic performance of heave plate by a finite volume method with shear stress transport sst turbulent model the accuracy of the computations was found reasonable for a plain plate while some errors were found for a reinforced plate holmes et al 2001 examined the hydrodynamic coefficients of a square heave plate by a finite element method with les turbulent model it was observed that the predicted force by morison s equation with determined hydrodynamic coefficients matched well with the measured force even in random wave conditions tao et al 2007 investigated spacing effects on the hydrodynamics of double circular heave plates and provided a recommendation for the arrangement of adjacent heave plate however in these studies hydrodynamic coefficients of the double heave plates were not validated by water tank tests and mechanism of hydrodynamic force on multiple heave plates has not been clarified yet formulas are beneficial for optimizing the design of offshore structures with heave plates the added mass of a pure circular heave plate along its axis approximately equals to the mass of a sphere of water enclosing the heave plate sarpkaya 2010 tao and cai 2004 proposed a formula for added mass of a circular heave plate attached by a column a formula for double circular heave plates by considering the effect of spacing ratio is firstly proposed by tao et al 2007 and the predicted added mass coefficient matches well with that obtained from the numerical simulation at low kc number philip philip et al 2013 put forward a simplified formula for added mass of a vertical cylinder with multiple heave plates however the formula is only suitable for non interacting plates which indicates the effect of heave plate spacing is not considered all the proposed formulas are limited to circular heave plates and influence of kc number is not taken into account in contrast to the formulas of c a the formula of c d is seldom studied tao and thiagarajan 2003a identified the coefficients in the formulas of c d proposed by graham 1980 for each defined vortex shedding flow regime but it might be inappropriate to propose the piecewise formula of c d since there are no clear watersheds to distinguish the vortex shedding regimes therefore a formula of c d covering those wide ranges of vortex shedding regime is preferred formulas of both c a and c d are also expected to cover various cross sections of heave plates such as circular octagonal and square heave plate and geometric parameters such as aspect ratio diameter ratio and spacing ratio in this paper section 2 describes governing equations and volume of fluid method grid arrangement boundary conditions cases of simulations and provides the validation of numerical results by a water tank test section 3 clarifies the mechanism of hydrodynamic forces on multiple heave plate and investigates the effect of geometrical parameters such as spacing ratio diameter ratio and aspect ratio in section

density 2 2 computational domain and grid arrangement quality of grid plays a crucial role in the accuracy of numerical results grid independences are studied in section 2 7 to choose a reasonable grid system for following computations the whole computational domain and grid around the model are displayed in fig 2 the computational domain is divided into two subdomains with respect to the simulated phases the lower subdomain is used to simulate the phase of water and bottom of the subdomain is 3 1 h away from the still water level swl where h is the draft of the model the upper subdomain is utilized to consider the phase of air and top of the subdomain is 0 6 h above the swl in order to mitigate the reflecting flow from the boundary side walls are located sufficiently far away from the model the distance between the model and inlet and outlet is 40 d c and 52 d c respectively d c is the diameter of the center column the grid is refined at the locations where substantial flow separations are expected and near swl to capture the shape of free surface as shown in fig 2 b in this study several configurations of multiple heave plates are simulated as described in section 2 4 the total cell number in the computational domain differs in the simulated models the grid number ranges from 4 5 million to 4 9 million among those simulated models grid parameters near the model are described in table 2 2 3 numerical schemes and boundary conditions a finite volume method is employed for present time dependent numerical simulations a second order central difference scheme is used for the convective and viscous term a first order implicit scheme is employed for the unsteady terms in the momentum equation as shown in eq 2 while an explicit approach is adopted for temporal discretization in the volume fraction equation as shown in eq 7 the courant number is 0 25 which means the time step for vof simulation will be chosen to be one fourth of the minimum transit time for any cell near the interface a pressure based segregated algorithm is used to solve the non linear and coupled governing equations a pressure implicit with splitting of operators piso algorithm is chosen to decrease the iterations for the pressure velocity coupling solutions table 3 summarizes the numerical schemes used in this study the governing equations are solved by a software ansys fluent the time step convergence and grid dependency are checked as mentioned by oka and ishihara 2009 and stern et al 2001 forced oscillation tests are carried out in the numerical simulations to evaluate the hydrodynamic coefficients and dynamic mesh with layering mesh update method is utilized to simulate the movement of the model the top of air phase and the bottom of water phase are treated as stationary boundaries while the model is oscillated up and down both split factor a s and collapse factor a c for the cells near the boundaries are 0 4 with respect to the first cell height h 1 at moving boundaries the layer of cells adjacent to the moving boundary is split or merged with layer of cells next to it based on the height of cells the cell heights are allowed to increase until h 1 a s h 1 and the cell heights can be compressed until h a c h 1 the governing equations are solved based on newly determined cell coordinate boundary conditions are summarized in table 4 no slip wall condition is adopted for the surface of model symmetry conditions is utilized for both the top of air phase the bottom of water phase and the side wells which indicates the shear stress at the boundary is zero outflow boundary condition zero gradient of velocity is applied to the inlet and outlet as the water tank test in the les model the wall shear stress is obtained from the laminar stress strain relationship when the centroid of wall adjacent cell is in the laminar sublayer with the height of y 11 25 as shown in fluent theory guide fluent theory guide 2012 if the mesh is too coarse to resolve the laminar sublayer it is assumed that the centroid of the wall adjacent cell falls within the logarithmic region of the boundary layer and the law of the wall is employed 2 4 simulation cases the model shown in fig 1 is firstly studied by vertically forced oscillation test the model is vertically forced to oscillate sinusoidally as in eq 8 8 x t a sin œât where x t is the time varying displacement in the vertical direction in this study a is the oscillating amplitude œâ is the oscillating angular frequency 2œÄ t and t is the oscillating period in the numerical simulations for the model shown in fig 1 the oscillating amplitude is 0 02 m and oscillating periods vary from 0 8 s to 2 1 s the tested cases for the multiple heave plates are listed in table 5 the kc number and frequency number Œ≤ shown in table 5 are defined as follows 9 kc v max d hp f œâa d hp f 2œÄa d hp 10 Œ≤ re kc v max d hp ŒΩ v max d hp f d hp 2 f ŒΩ where v max is the maximum oscillating velocity a is the oscillating amplitude d hp is the circumcircle diameter of the heave plate f is the oscillating frequency and ŒΩ is the kinematic viscosity of water in this study the effect of spacing between hp 1 and hp 2 see fig 1 on hydrodynamic coefficients is also investigated moreover influences of the diameter ratio d hp d c and the aspect ratio t hp d hp on the hydrodynamic coefficients are studied as well several configurations of the model are simulated in terms of different spacing diameter ratios and aspect ratios as specified in table 6 table 7 and table 8 respectively the spacing between hp 1 and hp 2 changes from 0 020 m to 0 225 m while the spacing between upper hull and hp 1 remain unchanged as shown in table 6 as a result the model draft varies from 0 295 m to 0 5 m the diameter and thickness of heave plates are kept as a constant consequently the spacing ratio of heave plates in present numerical simulations ranges from 0 060 to 0 674 in table 7 the thickness and circumcircle diameters of octagonal hp 1 and hp 2 remain unchanged while the diameter of column changes from 0 042 m to 0 167 m therefore the diameter ratio of heave plates ranges from 2 0 to 8 0 only a single heave plate is used to study the effect of aspect ratio on hydrodynamic coefficients in table 8 the thickness of the heave plate changes from 0 00334 m to 0 0668 m corresponding to the aspect ratio ranging from 0 010 to 0 200 the oscillating parameters used in this study are specified in table 9 2 5 definition of hydrodynamic coefficients the time series of predicted hydrodynamic force f h t is obtained by subtracting the buoyancy force f b and hydrostatic force f k t from the total predicted force f t which is obtained from the surface pressure and shear on the model 11 f h t f t f b f k t where 12 f b œÅ w g 13 f k t k r x t œÅ w is the water density g is the gravitational acceleration is the displaced volume by the model at its mean position k r is the hydrostatic stiffness and k r œÅ w g a w a w is the water plane area and x t is the time varying displacement of the model the hydrodynamic force f h t can be expressed in the form of morison s equation as follows 14 f h t c a m at x t 0 5 c d œÅ w a x t x t 1 3 c a œÅ w d hp 1 3 a œâ 2 sin œât 1 2 c d œÅ w a aœâ 2 cos œât cos œât where c a is the added mass coefficient c d is the drag

1 2 is the characteristic area of the heave plate x t and x t are the velocity and acceleration of the model motion respectively as shown in the reference sarpkaya 2010 fourier averages of c a and c d are obtained as follows 15 c a 0 t f h t sin œât dt 1 3 œÅ w d hp 1 3 a œâ 2 0 t si n 2 œât dt 3 œÄœâa œÅ w d hp 1 3 0 t f h t sin œât dt 16 c d 0 t f h t cos œât dt 1 2 œÅ w a œâa 2 0 t cos œât cos œât co s 2 œât dt 3 4 œÅ w aœâ a 2 0 t f h t cos œât dt the parameters of the model are described in table 10 2 6 water tank test a water tank test was carried out in this study to validate the predicted c a and c d by the numerical simulations dimensions of the water tank are 100 m length 5 m width and 2 65 m depth the water depth set up in this experiment is 2 0 m overview of the tested model is shown in fig 3 the detailed dimensions of the multiple heave plates are described in table 1 the cases conducted in the water tank test are listed in table 5 the time series of measured hydrodynamic force f h t is obtained by subtracting the buoyancy force f b inertia force f i t and hydrostatic force f k t from the measured total force f t 17 f h t f t f b f i t f k t where 18 f i t m x t m is the model mass including the mass of attachment used to connect the force balance and the model x t is the acceleration of the model motion f b and f k t are evaluated by eq 12 and eq 13 respectively the parameters of the model are listed in table 10 when the hydrodynamic force is obtained according to eq 17 the c a and c d are identified by eqs 15 and 16 respectively in order to mitigate the unstable result owing to measurement uncertainties ten periods of measured data are used in the data analysis 2 7 validation of numerical results in this section time history of predicted and measured hydrodynamic forces is presented in a non dimensional form as follows 19 c f t f h t 1 2 œÅ w a œâa 2 t t t where f h t is the predicted or measured hydrodynamic forces according to eq 11 and eq 17 a is the characteristic area of the heave plate and t is the non dimensional time the predicted and measured time history of non dimensional hydrodynamic force is illustrated in fig 4 the inertia contribution from force balance was excluded when analyzing the experimental data and the experimental data is filtered with cut off frequency to remove noise in signal eight period data from time zero was removed from experimental data to reach stable time series of hydrodynamic force consequently the predicted hydrodynamic force matches well with the measurement in terms of phase and the error of predicted amplitude is 1 3 time series of the predicted hydrodynamic force becomes stable after the initial first period in order to prevent the effect from the initial unstable solution on the accuracy of hydrodynamic coefficients the simulated data from the third period to the fifth period are chosen in the data analysis and the averaged coefficients are used in this paper the predicted and measured c a and c d in the case of an oscillating period of 1 3 s are presented in fig 5 for the purpose of grid and time step independence study it is found from fig 5 a that coarse grid brings about overestimation of hydrodynamic coefficients especially in the prediction of c d which implies that the fine grids around the corners of the heave plates are required to accurately simulate the flow separation the results obtained from the finest grid match well with those obtained from the experiment numerical results show a weak dependence on the time step as shown in fig 5 b it should be noted that the large time step will cause large courant number which significantly impacts the convergence of numerical iterations therefore a sufficiently small time step is required in vof method to simulate the unsteady flow consequently the finest grid and a time step of 0 001 s are used in following numerical simulations fig 6 shows predicted and measured c a and c d for different oscillating periods c a exhibits negligible oscillating periods dependence it is also found that c a is less than 2 0 even though one additional surface piercing plate is expected to provide some added mass the reason is primarily due to the fact that the shape of present heave plates is octagonal cross section which provides smaller added mass compared with the circular plate along with the presence of center columns depriving contribution to added mass approaching theoretical value predicted and measured c d are also found almost independent of oscillating period as shown in fig 6 b as a conclusion from this section predicted hydrodynamic coefficients for the multiple heave plates shows favorable agreement with those obtained from the water tank test and the c a is almost independent of frequency parameter Œ≤ while c d shows weak dependence on frequency parameter Œ≤ 3 mechanism of hydrodynamic force and effect of geometric parameters in this section mechanism of hydrodynamic force on the multiple heave plates are clarified and the effects of geometrical parameters such as spacing ratio diameter ratio and aspect ratio on hydrodynamic coefficients are then discussed the numerical results are also used in section 4 to provide database for deriving formulas of hydrodynamic coefficients the proposed formulas can be used in design of offshore structures with heave plates 3 1 mechanism of hydrodynamic force according to the predicted hydrodynamic force on each heave plate i e hp 1 and hp 2 as shown in fig 1 the c a and c d of each heave plate are evaluated by eq 15 and eq 16 respectively the hydrodynamic force used to evaluate the c a and c d of each plate f h hp i t are obtained by following expression 20 f h hp i t œÅ w g h t hp i a t hp i œÅ w g h b hp i a b hp i œÅ w g a b hp i a t hp i x t f hp i t where f hp i t refers to the calculated total force which includes the effect of hydrostatic pressure h b hp i and h t hp i represent the depth of lower and upper surface of the heave plate hp i from the still water level respectively a b hp i and a t hp i are the characteristic area of lower and upper surface of heave plate hp i respectively x t is the time varying displacement as given in eq 8 fig 7 shows the predicted c a and c d of hp 1 and hp 2 varying with oscillating periods it is found from fig 7 a that c a of hp 2 is slightly larger than that hp 1 which is because mass of an ellipsoid of water enclosing the hp 2 is larger than that of hp 1 due to absence of center column below hp 2 c d of hp 1 is larger than that of hp 2 especially in low oscillating periods as shown in fig 7 b which is because that the thinner plate the larger c d the significant nonlinearity of oscillating flow in higher oscillating frequency makes the differences between hp 1 and hp 2 more remarkable one additional simulation is carried out to investigate the effect of upper hull on the hydrodynamic coefficient of hp 1 as seen from fig 7 ca of hp 1 is close to ca of hp 2 when upper hull is absent the dynamic pressure will be used to explain the force acting on each heave plate and is made a non dimensional form as follows 21 c p p œÅ w gh 1 2 œÅ w œâa 2 where p is the pressure in the flow field which contains hydrodynamic pressure and hydrostatic pressure h is the depth of the computational cell from the still water level the time history of non dimensional hydrodynamic force on each heave plate is shown in fig 8 fig 9 b shows the corresponding instantaneous dynamic pressure distribution around the multiple heave plates in one oscillating period at time t 0 due to the previous accelerating ascent the upper surface of hp 1 acts as the like stagnation and is experiencing a positive dynamic pressure at this moment in addition the dynamic pressure around the lower surface of hp 1 is almost zero at this moment therefore the resultant hydrodynamic force acting on hp 1 is negative as shown in fig 8 from this moment the model starts to decelerate the upward moving flow caused by previous ascending model keeps moving upward at time 0 and velocity of the moving model is smaller than that of moving flow around it then the upper surface of hp 1 starts to locate in the wake of moving flow as a result the upper surface of hp 1 is subjected to negative dynamic pressure while the lower surface is experiencing positive dynamic pressure at time t 2 8 t the substantial magnitude of dynamic pressure at this moment leads to the maximal positive hydrodynamic force within the oscillating period see fig 8 the coming distribution of dynamic pressure at time t 4 8 t and t 6 8 t are very similar to those at t 0 and t 2 8 t whereas the sign of dynamic pressure is reverse similar phenomena and conclusions can also be found for the hp 2 the dynamic pressures around hp 1 and hp 2 at time t 2 8 t are almost same but the central column does not pierce the plate hp 2 being absent from the lower surface as a result the maximum hydrodynamic force on hp 2 is slightly larger than that of hp 1 as shown in fig 8 which leads to a larger c a for hp 2 as shown in fig 7 a 3 2 effect of spacing ratio and diameter ratio the cases listed in tables 6 and 7 are conducted to systematically study the effect of spacing ratio r l l d hp1 and diameter ratio r d d hp 1 d c respectively fig 9 a and b show the dynamic pressure distribution for two representative spacing ratios i e r l 0 06 and r l 0 674 the variation of c a and c d with different spacing ratios is shown in fig 18 in section 4 2 c a increases as the spacing between hp 1 and hp 2 increases in the case of r l 0 674 the sign of dynamic pressure on upper and lower surface of heave plate hp 2 are opposite at time t 2 8 t as shown in fig 9 b while the sign of dynamic pressure is identical in the case of r l 0 06 as shown in fig 9 a as a result the hydrodynamic force on the heave plate is smaller in the case of r l 0 06 and leads to the smaller added mass as indicated in fig 18 a it is also found from fig 18 a that the slope of variation of c a decreases as the spacing ratios increase which indicates that interaction between hp 1 and hp 2 becomes weak in larger spacing ratios it is expected that the c a will no longer increase when the spacing ratio exceeds a critical value similarly c d shown in fig 18 b also increases as the spacing ratio increases fig 10 a and b show the instantaneous flow vortex shedding pattern for the two representative spacing ratios i e r l 0 06 and r l 0 674 the non dimensional vorticity shown in fig 10 is defined as follows 22 w x w x d hp 1 v max where w x is x vorticity v max is the maximum oscillating velocity œâa the reason why c d is smaller in case of smaller spacing ratio is because vortex shedding around hp 1 and hp 2 are interactive over the whole oscillating period as shown in fig 10 a which significantly reduces the drag force when the spacing ratio exceeds a critical value the vortex shedding around hp 1 and hp 2 becomes independent as shown in fig 10 b and the c d reaches its maximum the variation of c a and c d with different diameter ratios is shown in fig 19 in section 4 2 fig 9 b and c exhibits dynamic pressure distribution for two representative diameter ratios i e r d 6 68 and r d 2 fig 10 b and c show the corresponding instantaneous flow vortex shedding pattern in one oscillating period it is seen from fig 19 a that c a increases as the diameter ratio increases even though the dynamic pressure distributions as shown in fig 9 b and c are almost same between those two representative diameter ratios the wet surface of the plate with smaller diameter ratio is smaller than that with larger diameter ratio as shown in fig 9 c which causes smaller hydrodynamic force and results in smaller c a as shown in fig 19 a similarly with the case of spacing ratio the slope of variation of c a decreases as the diameter ratio increases which is because the increase rate of wet surface decreases as the diameter ratio increases in contrast to c a c d is found to be independent of the diameter ratios as shown in fig 19 b within the range of diameter ratio from 2 0 to 8 0 it should be noted that the drag force mainly comes from the vortex shedding around the sharp edges of heave plates as seen from fig 10 b and c the vortex shedding near the sharp edges is not affected when the diameter ratio decreases therefore c d keeps almost unchanged by further increasing the diameter of the column the side wall of the column might disturb the vortex shedding around the heave plate probably resulting in smaller c d however such smaller diameter ratio is rarely used in the application of heave plate according to figs 18 b and 19 b c d provided by the double heave plates is less than 7 0 which is even smaller than that of a single heave plate predicted or measured in the literature lopez pavon and souto iglesias 2015 li et al 2013 the reason is primarily owing to the fact that the aspect ratio of the heave plates used in this study is significantly larger than those in the references 3 3 effect of aspect ratio the cases listed in table 8 are conducted to systematically study the effect of aspect ratio r t t hp d hp on hydrodynamic coefficients the thickness of the octagonal single heave plate is varied from 3 34 mm to 66 8 mm corresponding to the aspect ratio ranging from 0 01 to 0 2 the draft of the heave plate is identical to the depth of hp 2 shown in fig 1 the numerically identified c a and c d varying with the aspect ratios are shown in fig 12 in section 4 1 it is found that c a is independent of the aspect ratio because the change of the thickness has no influence on the change in characteristic area of upper and lower surface of the heave plate and has no remarkable impact on the dynamic pressure distribution in contrast to the c a c d is strongly dependent of the aspect ratio as shown in fig 12 b it is found that c d decreases as the aspect ratio increases variations of the thickness generate distinct vortex shedding patterns which have been reported in the references tao and thiagarajan 2003a 2003b fig 11 shows the instantaneous vortex shedding around the heave plate with two representative aspect ratios at time t 0 when the heave plate is moving upward from its mean position the unidirectional vortex shedding happens in the case of small aspect ratio as shown in fig 11 a while the interactive vortex shedding is observed under the condition of large aspect ratio in fig 11 b it is the emerging interaction of vortex shedding from the upper and lower surface of heave plate that leads to the decreased c d as the aspect ratio further increases independent vortex shedding pattern will happen as studied by tao and thiagarajan 2003a the aspect ratio of the hp 1 and hp 2 shown in fig 1 is 0 15 and 0 20 respectively therefore c d is expected smaller than those predicted and measured in the literature lopez pavon and souto iglesias 2015 li et al 2013 windfloat where the aspect ratio is around 0 005 0 01 in general the heave plate mainly has two functions one is used to reduce the heave motion in this sense the heave plate should be designed as thin as possible to reach sufficiently large c d such as the application in windfloat windfloat the other is used to stabilize the structure by lowering the center of gravity in this respect the heave plate would be designed with a certain thickness to allow for pouring the ballast water the present multiple heave plates aim to achieve the mentioned two functions at same time the usage of double heave plates makes c d reaches almost 7 0 which significantly increases the damping in the heave direction as a conclusion from this section change of aspect ratio only influences the c d change of the spacing ratio between multiple heave plates affects both c a and c d while the variation of diameter ratio only affects c a formulas of c a and c d according to those sensitive geometrical parameters will be established in next section 4 formulas of hydrodynamic coefficients in this section the formula of c a and c d are proposed considering various geometric parameters and kc number first the formulas for a single heave plate with various cross sections are improved and validated against published data in the literature and present numerical simulations then the formulas for each plate in the double heave plates considering the spacing and diameter ratio are proposed and validated by the numerical simulations 4 1 added mass and drag coefficient for a single heave plate theoretical added mass of a heave plate without an attached column equals to the mass of an ellipsoid of water enclosing the heave plate sarpkaya 2010 the ellipsoid is separated into two half ellipsoids by a finite distance thickness of the heave plate when one column is applied on the top of heave plate the volume taken by the column is excluded to represent the effective added mass consequently formula of c a for a single circular heave plate with a column is firstly proposed by tao et al 2007 and rewritten as follows 23 c a 1 1 4 3 r d 2 1 r d 2 1 1 r d 2 2 2 1 r d 2 where r d d c d hp which is the reciprocal of diameter ratio r d the proposed formula by tao et al 2007 is suitable for the case with very low kc number as mentioned in the references lopez pavon and souto iglesias 2015 tao et al 2004 2007 tao and cai 2004 that c a increases as kc number increases therefore a correction factor k 1 associated with kc number should be considered in the formula in addition it is found from the literature li et al 2013 tao et al 2004 tao and dray 2008 that c a is strongly dependent on heave plate cross sections such as circular and rectangular heave plate thus a shape correction factor k 2 which represents the change of cross section is needed when applying the formula for the heave plate other than circular ones in this study an integrated correction factor k expressed by the multiplication of k 1 and k 2 is used to take into account the effect of both kc number and shape correction factor the correction factor k is used to modify the diameter of the ellipsoid representing the added mass a linear function of kc number is adopted for k 1 in this study in the shape correction factor k 2 there is no reduction for the diameter of circular heave plate while the equivalent diameter is reduced to its 95 for an octagonal heave plate and is reduced to its 75 for a square heave plate they are purely empirical values based on the fitting of ca for an octagonal heave plate and a square heave plate it should be noted that the diameter is reduced with respect to the circumcircle diameter of the cross section as a result formula of c a for a single heave plate attached with a column is improved as follows 24 c a k 3 1 4 3 r d 2 k 2 r d 2 k k 2 r d 2 2 2k k 2 r d 2 25 k k 1 k 2 26 k 1 1 0 2 kc 27 k 2 1 00 circular heave plate 0 95 octagonal heave plate 0 75 square heave plate where r d d c d hp which is the reciprocal of diameter ratio r d k represents the correction factor which is a function of kc number and heave plate cross section and kc refers to the kc number as mentioned in section 3 3 and previous studies c d is dependent of aspect ratio r t and kc number according to the proposed formula c d a kc n by graham 1980 tao and thiagarajan 2003a identified the coefficients a and n for three typical vortex shedding regimes whereas c d actually varies with the aspect ratio r t even in one specific defined vortex shedding regime in other words the coefficient a in the formula should be a function of aspect ratio rather than a constant in this study by fixing the kc number as unit one the coefficient a as a function of aspect ratio r t is evaluated based on the data of c d versus aspect ratio r t in the study by tao and thiagarajan 2003a then the coefficient n is evaluated the evaluation of coefficient n for square heave plate follows the abovementioned procedure according to the data in the study by li et al 2013 in this study a new formula of c d is proposed to represent the effect of both aspect ratio and kc number for a single heave plate and is improved as below 28 c d min 1 7 r t 1 3 7 kc 1 k 3 12 29 k 3 2 5 circular heave plate 2 5 octagonal heave plate 3 0 square heave plate where r t t hp d hp is the aspect ratio of heave plate t hp is the thickness of heave plate and d hp is the circumcircle diameter of heave plate k 3 is a shape correction factor for different heave plate cross sections the upper bound of c d is limited to 12 for sake of the possible infinite value by the formula this upper limit is proposed based on the measured cd in the reference lopez pavon and souto iglesias 2015 in which c d is smaller than 12 in the condition with a very small thickness ratio of 0 005 fig 12 shows a comparison of numerical identified and formula predicted c a and c d of a single octagonal heave plate with different aspect ratios with consideration of the shape factor k 2 0 95 predicted c a from the present formula matches well with that obtained from the numerical simulation as shown in fig 12 a as can be found from fig 12 b aspect ratio dependence of c d is also represented well by the present formula especially for smaller aspect ratios where the unidirectional vortex shedding occurs as discussed in section 3 3 the proposed formula overestimates the drag coefficient in the transition regime in which complex interactive vortex shedding is expected as approaching independent vortex shedding pattern the accuracy of proposed formula for c d improves as shown in fig 12 b fig 13 a and b show formulas predicted and measured c a of a circular heave plate with an attached column and a square heave plate respectively the proposed formulas are capable of predicting c a precisely with a proper intercept and slope with variation in kc number for both circular plate with center column and square plate without column as seen from fig 13 a and b comparisons of formula predicted and measured c d for the heave plate with circular and square cross sections are presented in fig 14 it is found that the proposed formula shows a good prediction of c d varying with kc number in addition the variation of c d with aspect ratios is also well represented by the proposed formula as shown in fig 14 b therefore the proposed formulas of c a and c d for a single heave plate covers the application of different cross sections and kc number and show a good agreement with the measurement and present numerical results 4 2 added mass and drag coefficient for double heave plates the double heave plates could provide much more added mass and damping than that of a single heave plate the spacing l between the adjacent double heave plates is one key parameter in the determination of hydrodynamic coefficients if the spacing between the two heave plates reduces to zero the double heave plates actually act as a single heave plate in this case eq 24 and eq 28 can be used for evaluation of c a and c d respectively on the other hand when the spacing exceeds a critical value c a and c d will be independent of the spacing ratio in other words each heave plate will act as a fully separated plate when the spacing is between zero and the critical value a flow interaction between the double heave plates occurs and the hydrodynamic coefficients will be dependent on the spacing ratio in this range therefore the effect of spacing on the change of c a and c d for each heave plate should be considered the hp 2 in fig 1 is attached by only one column the formula of c a is exactly the same as that for the single heave plate if the spacing exceeds a critical value when the interaction between double heave plate occurs the formula of c a is derived by mathematically subtracting the intersection part of the two ellipsoids above hp 2 the formula of c a for hp 2 is expressed as follows 30 c a hp 2 k 3 1 32 12œÄ r d 2 r l 2k œÄ r l 2 4k œÄ r l r l 2k œÄ k 3 1 4 3 r d 2 k 2 r d 2 k k 2 r d 2 2 2k k 2 r d 2 r l 2k œÄ where r d d c d hp r l l d hp and k refers to the correction factor and is given in eq 25 the hp 1 in fig 1 is attached by two columns at both upper and lower surfaces therefore the volume taken by those two columns should be excluded in addition the spacing effect on the lower surface of hp 1 should be considered it is assumed that the upper surface of hp 1 is sufficiently far away from the still water level the formula of c a for hp 1 is expressed as follows 31 c a hp 1 k 3 1 4 3 r d 2 k 2 r d 2 k k 2 r d 2 2 2k k 2 r d 2 1 32 12œÄ r d 2 r l 2k œÄ r l 2 4k œÄ r l r l 2k œÄ k 3 1 2 3 r d 2 k 2 r d 2 k k 2 r d 2 2 2k k 2 r d 2 r l 2k œÄ as mentioned in section 3 2 c d mainly comes from the vortex shedding around the sharp edges of heave plate thus c d of the heave plate does not depend on the number of attached columns in addition it is assumed that c d linearly decreases as spacing ratio decreases formula of c d for each heave plate is given as follows 32 c d hp i min 1 7 r t hp i 1 3 7 kc 1 k 3 1 85 k 2 1 45 r l 12 r l 2 k 2 œÄ min 1 7 r t hp i 1 3 7 kc 1 k 3 12 r l 2 k 2 œÄ where r t hp i refers to the aspect ratio of each heave plate i e hp 1 or hp 2 k 2 and k 3 refer to the shape correction factors defined in eq 27 and eq 29 the coefficient with respect to the spacing ratio and the shape correction factor are identified according to the numerically predicted c d in this study fig 15 shows the numerically identified and formulas predicted c a and c d for each heave plate with different spacing ratios as shown in fig 15 a variation of c a with the spacing ratios is represented well by the present formula for hp 2 predicted c a for hp 1 is slightly smaller than that of hp 2 and it is overestimated compared with the numerical identified c a which is due to the effect of the upper hull above hp 1 as shown in fig 1 it is found that variation of c d with the spacing ratio and effect of the aspect ratio are favorably represented by the present formula as shown in fig 15 b fig 16 presents numerically identified and formulas predicted c a and c d for each heave plate with various diameter ratios the present formula shows a good performance for the prediction of c a varying with the diameter ratios especially for hp 2 in the case of smaller diameter ratio the gap of c a between hp 1 and hp 2 is larger compared with that in the larger diameter ratio which is due to the influence of the number of the attached column the formula predicted c a for hp 1 is also overestimated which is due to the effect of the upper hull above hp 1 as shown in fig 1 in contrast to the c a formula predicted c d is independent of diameter ratio and agrees reasonably well with numerical results in this study the proposed formulas of c a and c d for each plate simultaneously consider the effects of spacing ratio diameter ratio aspect ratio and kc number and show favorable agreement with the numerical simulations in order to evaluate c a and c d of double heave plates as a whole the formulas for each heave plate can be simply summed up as a result integral c a of double heave plates is obtained according to eq 30 and eq 31 as follows 33 c a 2 k 3 1 4 3 r d 2 k 2 r d 2 k k 2 r d 2 2 2k k 2 r d 2 1 16 12œÄ r d 2 r l 2k œÄ r l 2 4k œÄ r l r l 2k œÄ 2 k 3 3 4 3 r d 2 k 2 r d 2 k k 2 r d 2 2 2k k 2 r d 2 r l 2k œÄ where r d d c d hp r l l d hp and k refers to the correction factor and is given in eq 25 similarly formula for c d of double heave plates is obtained as follows 34 c d min 1 7 r t hp 1 1 3 7 r t hp 2 1 3 7 kc 1 k 3 3 7 k 2 2 9 r l 24 r l 2 k 2 œÄ min 1 7 r t hp 1 1 3 7 r t hp 2 1 3 7 kc 1 k 3 24 r l 2 k 2 œÄ where r t hp 1 and r t hp 2 represent the aspect ratio of heave plate hp 1 and hp 2 respectively k 2 and k 3 refer to the shape correction factors defined in eq 27 and eq 29 respectively fig 17 shows numerically identified c a of a double circular heave plates with different spacing ratios studied by tao et al 2007 c a predicted according to the formula proposed by tao et al and from present formula are shown in the figure as well it is found that c a is strongly dependent of conducted kc number comparing with previous formula the proposed formula successfully captures the trend of c a varying with kc number the differences between c a predicted by the proposed formula and the numerical simulations in smaller or larger spacing ratio might be owing to the limitation of the formula in the application for the small diameter ratio the diameter ratio of the model in the literature tao et al 2007 is only 1 31 and the local flow induced by flow separation and vortex shedding might be significantly impacted by the side wall of attached column fig 18 and fig 19 show c a and c d of the octagonal double heave plates varying with spacing ratios and diameter ratios respectively the overestimation of c a for hp 1 by proposed formula leads to the over prediction shown in fig 18 a the proposed formulas in this study are suitable for the heave plates which are sufficiently far away from the still water level the formula of c d for double heave plates shows a good accuracy even though proposed formula show some differences in estimation of c d for each heave plate in the application of multi plates containing more than two heave plates the integral c a and c d can be evaluated according to the arrangement of the heave plates and proposed formulas for each heave plate in this study 5 conclusions in this study hydrodynamic coefficients of multiple heave plates are investigated by numerical simulations and water tank tests the conclusions are summarized as follows 1 added mass and drag coefficients of multiple heave plates predicted by large eddy simulations with volume of fluid method show a good agreement with the experimental data by the water tank test grid and time step dependencies are investigated fine grid and small time step are required to accurately simulate the unsteady flow separation around the sharp edges of the heave plates which affect the accuracy of predicted drag coefficient 2 effects of spacing ratio and diameter ratio of the multiple heave plates are systematically studied by large eddy simulations the added mass coefficient c a increases as the spacing ratio increases till a critical value of spacing ratio and also increases as the diameter ratio increases the drag coefficient c d increases as the spacing ratio increases and is independent of the diameter ratio for a single heave plate c a is independent of the aspect ratio but c d decreases rapidly as the aspect ratio increases and it approaches a constant value when the aspect ratio exceeds a critical value 3 shape correction factors are proposed in the formulas of c a and c d for a single plate and double heave plates the formulas for a single heave plate with different cross sections are validated by the data in the literature and the numerical simulations in addition formulas of c a and c d for each heave plate in the double heaves are also proposed and validated by the numerical simulations in this study acknowledgement this research is carried out as a part of the fukushima floating offshore wind farm demonstration project funded by the ministry of economy trade and industry the authors wish to express their deepest gratitude to the concerned parties for their

project were completed off the coast of fukushima in 2013 and 2015 respectively fukushima forward in the semi submersible and advanced spar fowts heave plates are commonly used to reduce heave motions and to shift heave resonance periods out of the first order wave energy range lopez pavon and souto iglesias 2015 fukushima forward some new concepts of floating platform have been adopted a substation and a 5 mw fowt constructed in fukushima forward project fukushima forward adopt an advanced spar consisting of multiple heave plates the hydrodynamic characteristics of multiple heave plates is one of the key factors for the structural design of platforms morison s equation and potential theory are widely used to predict hydrodynamic loads on the platform of fowt phuc and ishihara 2007 waris and ishihara 2012 jonkman 2007 browning et al 2014 kvittem et al 2012 the hydrodynamic coefficients namely added mass and drag coefficients of heave plates hereinafter referred to as c a and c d respectively have to be determined to evaluate hydrodynamic loads on them the hydrodynamic coefficients of the heave plates can be attained by means of water tank tests lopez pavon and souto iglesias 2015 li et al 2013 numerical simulations lopez pavon and souto iglesias 2015 tao and thiagarajan 2003a 2003b tao et al 2004 2007 tao and cai 2004 garrido mendoza et al 2015 yang et al 2014 and empirical formulas tao et al 2007 tao and cai 2004 philip et al 2013 water tank tests have been carried out intensively to study the hydrodynamic coefficients of circular single heave plate lopez pavon and souto iglesias 2015 tao and dray 2008 and square single heave plate prislin blevins halkyard 1998 li et al 2013 an and faltinsen 2013 prislin blevins halkyard 1998 wadhwa and thiagarajan 2009 hydrodynamic coefficients of circular and square single heave plates were compared between each other in the study by lopez pavon and souto iglesias 2015 they pointed out that both c a and c d of the square heave plate are smaller than those of the circular heave plate they also confirmed that there is a relatively weak dependence of oscillating frequencies and a large dependence with keulegan carpenter kc number as well documented in references li et al 2013 an and faltinsen 2013 wadhwa et al wadhwa and thiagarajan 2009 wadhwa et al 2010 investigated the hydrodynamic coefficients of a heave plate near the free surface as the submergence of the heave plate decreases the free surface is expected to be disturbed it was observed that both c a and c d continuously increase as the distance to the free surface increases li et al 2013 studied the influence of plates spacing on the hydrodynamic coefficients it was found that the hydrodynamic coefficients decrease as spacing decreases a number of numerical studies on the hydrodynamic characteristics of heave plate have been conducted tao and cai 2004 investigated influences of heave plate diameter and kc number on hydrodynamic coefficients by finite difference method predicted damping ratio agreed well with the measured ones in both low and high kc regimes tao and thiagarajan 2003a 2003b presented three vortex shedding modes for oscillating heave plate and proposed a quantitative method of identifying the vortex shedding flow regimes lopez pavon and souto iglesias 2015 performed a numerical analysis of the hydrodynamic performance of heave plate by a finite volume method with shear stress transport sst turbulent model the accuracy of the computations was found reasonable for a plain plate while some errors were found for a reinforced plate holmes et al 2001 examined the hydrodynamic coefficients of a square heave plate by a finite element method with les turbulent model it was observed that the predicted force by morison s equation with determined hydrodynamic coefficients matched well with the measured force even in random wave conditions tao et al 2007 investigated spacing effects on the hydrodynamics of double circular heave plates and provided a recommendation for the arrangement of adjacent heave plate however in these studies hydrodynamic coefficients of the double heave plates were not validated by water tank tests and mechanism of hydrodynamic force on multiple heave plates has not been clarified yet formulas are beneficial for optimizing the design of offshore structures with heave plates the added mass of a pure circular heave plate along its axis approximately equals to the mass of a sphere of water enclosing the heave plate sarpkaya 2010 tao and cai 2004 proposed a formula for added mass of a circular heave plate attached by a column a formula for double circular heave plates by considering the effect of spacing ratio is firstly proposed by tao et al 2007 and the predicted added mass coefficient matches well with that obtained from the numerical simulation at low kc number philip philip et al 2013 put forward a simplified formula for added mass of a vertical cylinder with multiple heave plates however the formula is only suitable for non interacting plates which indicates the effect of heave plate spacing is not considered all the proposed formulas are limited to circular heave plates and influence of kc number is not taken into account in contrast to the formulas of c a the formula of c d is seldom studied tao and thiagarajan 2003a identified the coefficients in the formulas of c d proposed by graham 1980 for each defined vortex shedding flow regime but it might be inappropriate to propose the piecewise formula of c d since there are no clear watersheds to distinguish the vortex shedding regimes therefore a formula of c d covering those wide ranges of vortex shedding regime is preferred formulas of both c a and c d are also expected to cover various cross sections of heave plates such as circular octagonal and square heave plate and geometric parameters such as aspect ratio diameter ratio and spacing ratio in this

which is a 1 100 down scaled froude model of a substation yoshimoto 2016 employed in fukushima forward project the floater contains three hulls which are connected by one cylindrical column the fully submerged middle and lower hull have the function of heave plate in reducing heave motion the overview of the floater and its dimensions are shown in fig 1 the center line of the upper hull is located at still water level swl all the hulls are octagonal cross sectional plate the detailed dimension of the model is specified in table 1 the governing equation and vof method is given in section 2 1 the

governing equation large eddy simulation les is adopted and the boussinesq hypothesis is employed and the standard smagorinsky lilly model is used to calculate the subgrid scale sgs stresses the

density 2 2 computational domain and grid arrangement quality of grid plays a crucial role in the accuracy of numerical results grid independences are studied in section 2 7 to choose a reasonable grid system for following computations the whole computational domain and grid around the model are displayed in fig 2 the computational domain is divided into two subdomains with respect to the simulated phases the lower subdomain is used to simulate the phase of water and bottom of the subdomain is 3 1 h away from the still water level swl where h is the draft of the model the upper subdomain is utilized to consider the phase of air and top of the subdomain is 0 6 h above the swl in order to mitigate the reflecting flow from the boundary side walls are located sufficiently far away from the model the distance between the model and inlet and outlet is 40 d c and 52 d c respectively d c is the diameter of the center column the grid is refined at the locations where substantial flow separations are expected and near swl to capture the shape of free surface as shown in fig 2 b in this study several configurations of multiple heave plates are simulated as described in section 2 4 the total cell number in the computational domain differs in the simulated models the grid number ranges from 4 5 million to 4 9 million among those simulated models grid parameters near the model are described in table 2 2 3 numerical schemes and boundary conditions a finite volume method is employed for present time dependent numerical simulations a second order central difference scheme is used for the convective and viscous term a first order implicit scheme is employed for the unsteady terms in the momentum equation as shown in eq 2 while an explicit approach is adopted for temporal discretization in the volume fraction equation as shown in eq 7 the courant number is 0 25 which means the time step for vof simulation will be chosen to be one fourth of the minimum transit time for any cell near the interface a pressure based segregated algorithm is used to solve the non linear and coupled governing equations a pressure implicit with splitting of

solved by a software ansys fluent the time step convergence and grid dependency are checked as mentioned by oka and ishihara 2009 and stern et al 2001 forced oscillation tests are carried out in the numerical simulations to evaluate the hydrodynamic coefficients and dynamic mesh with layering mesh update method is utilized to simulate the movement of the model the top of air phase and the bottom of water phase are treated as stationary boundaries while the model is oscillated up and down both split factor a s and collapse factor a c for the cells near the boundaries are 0 4 with respect to the first cell height h 1 at moving boundaries the layer of cells adjacent to the moving boundary is split or merged with layer of cells next to it based on the height of cells the cell heights are allowed to increase until h 1 a s h 1 and the cell heights can be compressed until h a c h 1 the governing equations are solved based on newly determined cell coordinate boundary conditions are summarized in table 4 no slip wall condition is adopted for the surface of model symmetry conditions is utilized for both the top of air phase the bottom of water phase and the side wells which indicates the shear stress at the boundary is zero outflow boundary condition zero gradient of velocity is applied to the inlet and outlet as the water tank test in the les model the wall shear stress is obtained from the laminar stress strain relationship when the centroid of wall adjacent cell is in the laminar sublayer with the height of y 11 25 as shown in fluent theory guide fluent theory guide 2012 if the mesh is too coarse to resolve the laminar sublayer it is assumed that the centroid of the wall adjacent cell falls within the logarithmic region of the boundary layer and the law of the wall is employed 2 4 simulation cases the model shown in fig 1 is firstly studied by vertically forced oscillation test the model is vertically forced to oscillate sinusoidally as in eq 8 8 x t a sin œât where x t is the time varying displacement in the vertical direction in this study a is the oscillating amplitude œâ is the oscillating angular frequency 2œÄ t and t is the oscillating period in the numerical simulations for the model shown in fig 1 the oscillating amplitude is 0 02 m and oscillating periods vary from 0 8 s to 2 1 s the tested cases for the multiple heave plates are listed in table 5 the kc number and frequency number Œ≤ shown in table 5 are defined as follows 9 kc v max d hp f œâa d hp f 2œÄa d hp 10 Œ≤ re kc v max d hp ŒΩ v max d hp f d hp 2 f ŒΩ where v max is the maximum oscillating velocity a is the oscillating amplitude d hp is the circumcircle diameter of the heave plate f is the oscillating frequency and ŒΩ is the kinematic viscosity of water in this study the effect of spacing between hp 1 and hp 2 see fig 1 on hydrodynamic coefficients is also investigated moreover influences of the diameter ratio d hp d c and the aspect ratio t hp d hp on the hydrodynamic coefficients are studied as well several configurations of the model are simulated in terms of different spacing diameter ratios and aspect ratios as specified in table 6 table 7 and table 8 respectively the spacing between hp 1 and hp 2 changes from 0 020 m to 0 225 m while the spacing between upper hull and hp 1 remain unchanged as shown in table 6 as a result the model draft varies from 0 295 m to 0 5 m the diameter and thickness of heave plates are kept as a constant consequently the spacing ratio of heave plates in present numerical simulations ranges from 0 060 to 0 674 in table 7 the thickness and circumcircle diameters of octagonal hp 1 and hp 2 remain unchanged while the diameter of column changes from 0 042 m to 0 167 m therefore the diameter ratio of heave plates ranges from 2 0 to 8 0 only a single heave plate is used to study the effect of aspect ratio on hydrodynamic coefficients in table 8 the thickness of the heave plate changes from 0 00334 m to 0 0668 m corresponding to the aspect ratio ranging from 0 010 to 0 200 the oscillating parameters used in this study are specified in table 9 2 5 definition of hydrodynamic coefficients the time series of predicted hydrodynamic force f h t is obtained by subtracting the buoyancy force f b and hydrostatic force f k t from the total predicted force f t which is obtained from the surface pressure and shear on the model 11 f h t f t f b f k t where 12 f b œÅ w g 13 f k t k r x t œÅ w is the water density g is the gravitational acceleration is the displaced volume by the model at its mean position k r is the hydrostatic stiffness and k r œÅ w g a w a w is the water plane area and x t is the time varying displacement of the model the hydrodynamic force f h t can be expressed in the form of morison s equation as follows 14 f h t c a m at x t 0 5 c d œÅ w a x t x t 1 3 c a œÅ w d hp 1 3 a œâ 2 sin œât 1 2 c d œÅ w a aœâ 2 cos œât cos œât where c a is the added mass coefficient c d is the drag

1 2 is the characteristic area of the heave plate x t and x t are the velocity and acceleration of the model motion respectively as shown in the reference sarpkaya 2010 fourier averages of c a and c d are obtained as follows 15 c a 0 t f h t sin œât dt 1 3 œÅ w d hp 1 3 a œâ 2 0 t si n 2 œât dt 3 œÄœâa œÅ w d hp 1 3 0 t f h t sin œât dt 16 c d 0 t f h t cos œât dt 1 2 œÅ w a œâa 2 0 t cos œât cos œât co s 2 œât dt 3 4 œÅ w aœâ a 2 0 t f h t cos œât dt the parameters of the model are described in table 10 2 6 water tank test a water tank test was carried out in this study to validate the predicted c a and c d by the numerical simulations dimensions of the water tank are 100 m length 5 m width and 2 65 m depth the water depth set up in this experiment is 2 0 m overview of the tested model is shown in fig 3 the detailed dimensions of the multiple heave plates are described in table 1 the cases conducted in the water tank test are listed in table 5 the time series of measured hydrodynamic force f h t is obtained by subtracting the buoyancy force f b inertia force f i t and hydrostatic force f k t from the measured total force f t 17 f h t f t f b f i t f k t where 18 f i t m x t m is the model mass including the mass of attachment used to connect the force balance and the model x t is the acceleration of the model motion f b and f k t are evaluated by eq 12 and eq 13 respectively the parameters of the model are listed in table 10 when the hydrodynamic force is obtained according to eq 17 the c a and c d are identified by eqs 15 and 16 respectively in order to mitigate the unstable result owing to measurement uncertainties ten periods of measured data are used in the data analysis 2 7 validation of numerical results in this section time history of predicted and measured hydrodynamic forces is presented in a non dimensional form as follows 19 c f t f h t 1 2 œÅ w a œâa 2 t t t where f h t is the predicted or measured hydrodynamic forces according to eq 11 and eq 17 a is the characteristic area of the heave plate and t is the non dimensional time the predicted and measured time history of non dimensional hydrodynamic force is illustrated in fig 4 the inertia contribution from force balance was excluded when analyzing the experimental data and the experimental data is filtered with cut off frequency to remove noise in signal eight period data from time zero was removed from experimental data to reach stable time series of hydrodynamic force consequently the predicted hydrodynamic force matches well with the measurement in terms of phase and the error of predicted amplitude is 1 3 time series of the predicted hydrodynamic force becomes stable after the initial first period in order to prevent the effect from the initial unstable solution on the accuracy of hydrodynamic coefficients the simulated data from the third period to the fifth period are chosen in the data analysis and the averaged coefficients are used in this paper the predicted and measured c a and c d in the case of an oscillating period of 1 3 s are presented in fig 5 for the purpose of grid and time step independence study it is found from fig 5 a that coarse grid brings about overestimation of hydrodynamic coefficients especially in the prediction of c d which implies that the fine grids around the corners of the heave plates are required to accurately simulate the flow separation the results obtained from the finest grid match well with those obtained from the experiment numerical results show a weak dependence on the time step as shown in fig 5 b it should be noted that the large time step will cause large courant number which significantly impacts the convergence of numerical iterations therefore a sufficiently small time step is required in vof method to simulate the unsteady flow consequently the finest grid and a time step of 0 001 s are used in following numerical simulations fig 6 shows predicted and measured c a and c d for different oscillating periods c a exhibits negligible oscillating periods dependence it is also found that c a is less than 2 0 even though one additional surface piercing plate is expected to provide some added mass the reason is primarily due to the fact that the shape of present heave plates is octagonal cross section which provides smaller added mass compared with the circular plate along with the presence of center columns depriving contribution to added mass approaching theoretical value predicted and measured c d are also found almost independent of oscillating period as shown in fig 6 b as a conclusion from this section predicted hydrodynamic coefficients for the multiple heave plates shows favorable agreement with those obtained from the water tank test and the c a is almost independent of frequency parameter Œ≤ while c d shows weak dependence on frequency parameter Œ≤ 3 mechanism of hydrodynamic force and effect of geometric parameters in this section mechanism of hydrodynamic force on the multiple heave plates are clarified and the effects of geometrical parameters such as spacing ratio diameter ratio and aspect ratio on hydrodynamic coefficients are then discussed the numerical results are also used in section 4 to provide database for deriving formulas of hydrodynamic coefficients the proposed formulas can be used in design of offshore structures with heave plates 3 1 mechanism of hydrodynamic force according to the predicted hydrodynamic force on each heave plate i e hp 1 and hp 2 as shown in fig 1 the c a and c d of each heave plate are evaluated by eq 15 and eq 16 respectively the hydrodynamic force used to evaluate the c a and c d of each plate f h hp i t are obtained by following expression 20 f h hp i t œÅ w g h t hp i a t hp i œÅ w g h b hp i a b hp i œÅ w g a b hp i a t hp i x t f hp i t where f hp i t refers to the calculated total force which includes the effect of hydrostatic pressure h b hp i and h t hp i represent the depth of lower and upper surface of the heave plate hp i from the still water level respectively a b hp i and a t hp i are the characteristic area of lower and upper surface of heave plate hp i respectively x t is the time varying displacement as given in eq 8 fig 7 shows the predicted c a and c d of hp 1 and hp 2 varying with oscillating periods it is found from fig 7 a that c a of hp 2 is slightly larger than that hp 1 which is because mass of an ellipsoid of water enclosing the hp 2 is larger than that of hp 1 due to absence of center column below hp 2 c d of hp 1 is larger than that of hp 2 especially in low oscillating periods as shown in fig 7 b which is because that the thinner plate the larger c d the significant nonlinearity of oscillating flow in higher oscillating frequency makes the differences between hp 1 and hp 2 more remarkable one additional simulation is carried out to investigate the effect of upper hull on the hydrodynamic coefficient of hp 1 as seen from fig 7 ca of hp 1 is close to ca of hp 2 when upper hull is absent the dynamic pressure will be used to explain the force acting on each heave plate and is made a non dimensional form as follows 21 c p p œÅ w gh 1 2 œÅ w œâa 2 where p is the pressure in the flow field which contains hydrodynamic pressure and hydrostatic pressure h is the depth of the computational cell from the still water level the time history of non dimensional hydrodynamic force on each heave plate is shown in fig 8 fig 9 b shows the corresponding instantaneous dynamic pressure distribution around the multiple heave plates in one oscillating period at time t 0 due to the previous accelerating ascent the upper surface of hp 1 acts as the like stagnation and is experiencing a positive dynamic pressure at this moment in addition the dynamic pressure around the lower surface of hp 1 is almost zero at this moment therefore the resultant hydrodynamic force acting on hp 1 is negative as shown in fig 8 from this moment the model starts to decelerate the upward moving flow caused by previous ascending model keeps moving upward at time 0 and velocity of the moving model is smaller than that of moving flow around it then the upper surface of hp 1 starts to locate in the wake of moving flow as a result the upper surface of hp 1 is subjected to negative dynamic pressure while the lower surface is experiencing positive dynamic pressure at time t 2 8 t the substantial magnitude of dynamic pressure at this moment leads to the maximal positive hydrodynamic force within the oscillating period see fig 8 the coming distribution of dynamic pressure at time t 4 8 t and t 6 8 t are very similar to those at t 0 and t 2 8 t whereas the sign of dynamic pressure is reverse similar phenomena and conclusions can also be found for the hp 2 the dynamic pressures around hp 1 and hp 2 at time t 2 8 t are almost same but the central column does not pierce the plate hp 2 being absent from the lower surface as a result the maximum hydrodynamic force on hp 2 is slightly larger than that of hp 1 as shown in fig 8 which leads to a larger c a for hp 2 as shown in fig 7 a 3 2 effect of spacing ratio and diameter ratio the cases listed in tables 6 and 7 are conducted to systematically study the effect of spacing ratio r l l d hp1 and diameter ratio r d d hp 1 d c respectively fig 9 a and b show the dynamic pressure distribution for two representative spacing ratios i e r l 0 06 and r l 0 674 the variation of c a and c d with different spacing ratios is shown in fig 18 in section 4 2 c a increases as the spacing between hp 1 and hp 2 increases in the case of r l 0 674 the sign of dynamic pressure on upper and lower surface of heave plate hp 2 are opposite at time t 2 8 t as shown in fig 9 b while the sign of dynamic pressure is identical in the case of r l 0 06 as shown in fig 9 a as a result the hydrodynamic force on the heave plate is smaller in the case of r l 0 06 and leads to the smaller added mass as indicated in fig 18 a it is also found from fig 18 a that the slope of variation of c a decreases as the spacing ratios increase which indicates that interaction between hp 1 and hp 2 becomes weak in larger spacing ratios it is expected that the c a will no longer increase when the spacing ratio exceeds a critical value similarly c d shown in fig 18 b also increases as the spacing ratio increases fig 10 a and b show the instantaneous flow vortex shedding pattern for the two representative spacing ratios i e r l 0 06 and r l 0 674 the non dimensional vorticity shown in fig 10 is defined as follows 22 w x w x d hp 1 v max where w x is x vorticity v max is the maximum oscillating velocity œâa the reason why c d is smaller in case of smaller spacing ratio is because vortex shedding around hp 1 and hp 2 are interactive over the whole oscillating period as shown in fig 10 a which significantly reduces the drag force when the spacing ratio exceeds a critical value the vortex shedding around hp 1 and hp 2 becomes independent as shown in fig 10 b and the c d reaches its maximum the variation of c a and c d with different diameter ratios is shown in fig 19 in section 4 2 fig 9 b and c exhibits dynamic pressure distribution for two representative diameter ratios i e r d 6 68 and r d 2 fig 10 b and c show the corresponding instantaneous flow vortex shedding pattern in one oscillating period it is seen from fig 19 a that c a increases as the diameter ratio increases even though the dynamic pressure distributions as shown in fig 9 b and c are almost same between those two representative diameter ratios the wet surface of the plate with smaller diameter ratio is smaller than that with larger diameter ratio as shown in fig 9 c which causes smaller hydrodynamic force and results in smaller c a as shown in fig 19 a similarly with the case of spacing ratio the slope of variation of c a decreases as the diameter ratio increases which is because the increase rate of wet surface decreases as the diameter ratio increases in contrast to c a c d is found to be independent of the diameter ratios as shown in fig 19 b within the range of diameter ratio from 2 0 to 8 0 it should be noted that the drag force mainly comes from the vortex shedding around the sharp edges of heave plates as seen from fig 10 b and c the vortex shedding near the sharp edges is not affected when the diameter ratio decreases therefore c d keeps almost unchanged by further increasing the diameter of the column the side wall of the column might disturb the vortex shedding around the heave plate probably resulting in smaller c d however such smaller diameter ratio is rarely used in the application of heave plate according to figs 18 b and 19 b c d provided by the double heave plates is less than 7 0 which is even smaller than that of a single heave plate predicted or measured in the literature lopez pavon and souto iglesias 2015 li et al 2013 the reason is primarily owing to the fact that the aspect ratio of the heave plates used in this study is significantly larger than those in the references 3 3 effect of aspect ratio the cases listed in table 8 are conducted to systematically study the effect of aspect ratio r t t hp d hp on hydrodynamic coefficients the thickness of the octagonal single heave plate is varied from 3 34 mm to 66 8 mm corresponding to the aspect ratio ranging from 0 01 to 0 2 the draft of the heave plate is identical to the depth of hp 2 shown in fig 1 the numerically identified c a and c d varying with the aspect ratios are shown in fig 12 in section 4 1 it is found that c a is independent of the aspect ratio because the change of the thickness has no influence on the change in characteristic area of upper and lower surface of the heave plate and has no remarkable impact on the dynamic pressure distribution in contrast to the c a c d is strongly dependent of the aspect ratio as shown in fig 12 b it is found that c d decreases as the aspect ratio increases variations of the thickness generate distinct vortex shedding patterns which have been reported in the references tao and thiagarajan 2003a 2003b fig 11 shows the instantaneous vortex shedding around the heave plate with two representative aspect ratios at time t 0 when the heave plate is moving upward from its mean position the unidirectional vortex shedding happens in the case of small aspect ratio as shown in fig 11 a while the interactive vortex shedding is observed under the condition of large aspect ratio in fig 11 b it is the emerging interaction of vortex shedding from the upper and lower surface of heave plate that leads to the decreased c d as the aspect ratio further increases independent vortex shedding pattern will happen as studied by tao and thiagarajan 2003a the aspect ratio of the hp 1 and hp 2 shown in fig 1 is 0 15 and 0 20 respectively therefore c d is expected smaller than those predicted and measured in the literature lopez pavon and souto iglesias 2015 li et al 2013 windfloat where the aspect ratio is around 0 005 0 01 in general the heave plate mainly has two functions one is used to reduce the heave motion in this sense the heave plate should be designed as thin as possible to reach sufficiently large c d such as the application in windfloat windfloat the other is used to stabilize the structure by lowering the center of gravity in this respect the heave plate would be designed with a certain thickness to allow for pouring the ballast water the present multiple heave plates aim to achieve the mentioned two functions at same time the usage of double heave plates makes c d reaches almost 7 0 which significantly increases the damping in the heave direction as a conclusion from this section change of aspect ratio only influences the c d change of the spacing ratio between multiple heave plates affects both c a and c d while the variation of diameter ratio only affects c a formulas of c a and c d according to those sensitive geometrical parameters will be established in next section 4 formulas of hydrodynamic coefficients in this section the formula of c a and c d are proposed considering various geometric parameters and kc number first the formulas for a single heave plate with various cross sections are improved and validated against published data in the literature and present numerical simulations then the formulas for each plate in the double heave plates considering the spacing and diameter ratio are proposed and validated by the numerical simulations 4 1 added mass and drag coefficient for a single heave plate theoretical added mass of a heave plate without an attached column equals to the mass of an ellipsoid of water enclosing the heave plate sarpkaya 2010 the ellipsoid is separated into two half ellipsoids by a finite distance thickness of the heave plate when one column is applied on the top of heave plate the volume taken by the column is excluded to represent the effective added mass consequently formula of c a for a single circular heave plate with a column is firstly proposed by tao et al 2007 and rewritten as follows 23 c a 1 1 4 3 r d 2 1 r d 2 1 1 r d 2 2 2 1 r d 2 where r d d c d hp which is the reciprocal of diameter ratio r d the proposed formula by tao et al 2007 is suitable for the case with very low kc number as mentioned in the references lopez pavon and souto iglesias 2015 tao et al 2004 2007 tao and cai 2004 that c a increases as kc number increases therefore a correction factor k 1 associated with kc number should be considered in the formula in addition it is found from the literature li et al 2013 tao et al 2004 tao and dray 2008 that c a is strongly dependent on heave plate cross sections such as circular and rectangular heave plate thus a shape correction factor k 2 which represents the change of cross section is needed when applying the formula for the heave plate other than circular ones in this study an integrated correction factor k expressed by the multiplication of k 1 and k 2 is used to take into account the effect of both kc number and shape correction factor the correction factor k is used to modify the diameter of the ellipsoid representing the added mass a linear function of kc number is adopted for k 1 in this study in the shape correction factor k 2 there is no reduction for the diameter of circular heave plate while the equivalent diameter is reduced to its 95 for an octagonal heave plate and is reduced to its 75 for a square heave plate they are purely empirical values based on the fitting of ca for an octagonal heave plate and a square heave plate it should be noted that the diameter is reduced with respect to the circumcircle diameter of the cross section as a result formula of c a for a single heave plate attached with a column is improved as follows 24 c a k 3 1 4 3 r d 2 k 2 r d 2 k k 2 r d 2 2 2k k 2 r d 2 25 k k 1 k 2 26 k 1 1 0 2 kc 27 k 2 1 00 circular heave plate 0 95 octagonal heave plate 0 75 square heave plate where r d d c d hp which is the reciprocal of diameter ratio r d k represents the correction factor which is a function of kc number and heave plate cross section and kc refers to the kc number as mentioned in section 3 3 and previous studies c d is dependent of aspect ratio r t and kc number according to the proposed formula c d a kc n by graham 1980 tao and thiagarajan 2003a identified the coefficients a and n for three typical vortex shedding regimes whereas c d actually varies with the aspect ratio r t even in one specific defined vortex shedding regime in other words the coefficient a in the formula should be a function of aspect ratio rather than a constant in this study by fixing the kc number as unit one the coefficient a as a function of aspect ratio r t is evaluated based on the data of c d versus aspect ratio r t in the study by tao and thiagarajan 2003a then the coefficient n is evaluated the evaluation of coefficient n for square heave plate follows the abovementioned procedure according to the data in the study by li et al 2013 in this study a new formula of c d is proposed to represent the effect of both aspect ratio and kc number for a single heave plate and is improved as below 28 c d min 1 7 r t 1 3 7 kc 1 k 3 12 29 k 3 2 5 circular heave plate 2 5 octagonal heave plate 3 0 square heave plate where r t t hp d hp is the aspect ratio of heave plate t hp is the thickness of heave plate and d hp is the circumcircle diameter of heave plate k 3 is a shape correction factor for different heave plate cross sections the upper bound of c d is limited to 12 for sake of the possible infinite value by the formula this upper limit is proposed based on the measured cd in the reference lopez pavon and souto iglesias 2015 in which c d is smaller than 12 in the condition with a very small thickness ratio of 0 005 fig 12 shows a comparison of numerical identified and formula predicted c a and c d of a single octagonal heave plate with different aspect ratios with consideration of the shape factor k 2 0 95 predicted c a from the present formula matches well with that obtained from the numerical simulation as shown in fig 12 a as can be found from fig 12 b aspect ratio dependence of c d is also represented well by the present formula especially for smaller aspect ratios where the unidirectional vortex shedding occurs as discussed in section 3 3 the proposed formula overestimates the drag coefficient in the transition regime in which complex interactive vortex shedding is expected as approaching independent vortex shedding pattern the accuracy of proposed formula for c d improves as shown in fig 12 b fig 13 a and b show formulas predicted and measured c a of a circular heave plate with an attached column and a square heave plate respectively the proposed formulas are capable of predicting c a precisely with a proper intercept and slope with variation in kc number for both circular plate with center column and square plate without column as seen from fig 13 a and b comparisons of formula predicted and measured c d for the heave plate with circular and square cross sections are presented in fig 14 it is found that the proposed formula shows a good prediction of c d varying with kc number in addition the variation of c d with aspect ratios is also well represented by the proposed formula as shown in fig 14 b therefore the proposed formulas of c a and c d for a single heave plate covers the application of different cross sections and kc number and show a good agreement with the measurement and present numerical results 4 2 added mass and drag coefficient for double heave plates the double heave plates could provide much more added mass and damping than that of a single heave plate the spacing l between the adjacent double heave plates is one key parameter in the determination of hydrodynamic coefficients if the spacing between the two heave plates reduces to zero the double heave plates actually act as a single heave plate in this case eq 24 and eq 28 can be used for evaluation of c a and c d respectively on the other hand when the spacing exceeds a critical value c a and c d will be independent of the spacing ratio in other words each heave plate will act as a fully separated plate when the spacing is between zero and the critical value a flow interaction between the double heave plates occurs and the hydrodynamic coefficients will be dependent on the spacing ratio in this range therefore the effect of spacing on the change of c a and c d for each heave plate should be considered the hp 2 in fig 1 is attached by only one column the formula of c a is exactly the same as that for the single heave plate if the spacing exceeds a critical value when the interaction between double heave plate occurs the formula of c a is derived by mathematically subtracting the intersection part of the two ellipsoids above hp 2 the formula of c a for hp 2 is expressed as follows 30 c a hp 2 k 3 1 32 12œÄ r d 2 r l 2k œÄ r l 2 4k œÄ r l r l 2k œÄ k 3 1 4 3 r d 2 k 2 r d 2 k k 2 r d 2 2 2k

the volume taken by those two columns should be excluded in addition the spacing effect on the lower surface of hp 1 should be considered it is assumed that the upper surface of hp 1 is sufficiently far away from the still water level the formula of c a for hp 1 is expressed as follows 31 c a hp 1 k 3 1 4 3 r d 2 k 2 r d 2 k k 2 r d 2 2 2k k 2 r d 2 1 32 12œÄ r d 2 r l 2k œÄ r l 2 4k œÄ r l r l

plate does not depend on the number of attached columns in addition it is assumed that c d linearly decreases as spacing ratio decreases formula of c d for each heave plate is given as follows 32 c d

2 and k 3 refer to the shape correction factors defined in eq 27 and eq 29 the coefficient with respect to the spacing ratio and the shape correction factor are identified according to the numerically predicted c d in this study fig 15 shows the numerically identified and formulas predicted c a and c d for each heave plate with different spacing ratios as shown in fig 15 a variation of c a with the spacing ratios is represented well by the present formula for hp 2 predicted c a for hp 1 is slightly smaller than that of hp 2 and it is overestimated compared with the numerical identified c a which is due to the effect of the upper hull above hp 1 as shown in fig 1 it is found that variation of c d with the spacing ratio and effect of the aspect ratio are favorably represented by the present formula as shown in fig 15 b fig 16 presents numerically identified and formulas predicted c a and c d for each heave plate with various diameter ratios the present formula shows a good performance for the prediction of c a varying with the diameter ratios especially for hp 2 in the case of smaller diameter ratio the gap of c a between hp 1 and hp 2 is larger compared with that in the larger diameter ratio which is due to the influence of the number of the attached column the formula predicted c a for hp 1 is also overestimated which is due to the effect of the upper hull above hp 1 as shown in fig 1 in contrast to the c a formula predicted c d is independent of diameter ratio and agrees reasonably well with numerical results in this study the proposed formulas of c a and c d for each plate simultaneously consider the effects of spacing ratio diameter ratio aspect ratio and kc number and show favorable agreement with the numerical simulations in order to evaluate c a and c d of double heave plates as a whole the formulas for each heave plate can be simply summed up as a result integral c a of double heave plates is obtained according to eq 30 and eq 31 as follows 33 c a 2

the shape correction factors defined in eq 27 and eq 29 respectively fig 17 shows numerically identified c a of a double circular heave plates with different spacing ratios studied by tao et al 2007 c a predicted according to the formula proposed by tao et al and from present formula are shown in the figure as well it is found that c a is strongly dependent of conducted kc number comparing with previous formula the proposed formula successfully captures the trend of c a varying with kc number the differences between c a predicted by the proposed formula and the numerical simulations in smaller or larger spacing ratio might be owing to the limitation of the formula in the application for the small diameter ratio the diameter ratio of the model in the literature tao et al 2007 is only 1 31 and the local flow induced by flow separation and vortex shedding might be significantly impacted by the side wall of attached column fig 18 and fig 19 show c a and c d of the octagonal double heave plates varying with spacing ratios and diameter ratios respectively the overestimation of c a for hp 1 by proposed formula leads to the over prediction shown in fig 18 a the proposed formulas in this study are suitable for the heave plates which are sufficiently far away from the still water level the formula of c d for double heave plates shows a good accuracy even though proposed formula show some differences in estimation of c d for each heave plate in the application of multi plates containing more than two heave plates the integral c a and c d can be evaluated according to the arrangement of the heave plates and proposed formulas for each heave plate in this study 5 conclusions in this study hydrodynamic coefficients of multiple heave plates are investigated by numerical simulations and water tank tests the conclusions are summarized as follows 1 added mass and drag coefficients of multiple heave plates predicted by large eddy simulations with volume of fluid method show a good agreement with the experimental data by the water tank test grid and time step dependencies are investigated fine grid and small time step are required to accurately simulate the unsteady flow separation around the sharp edges of the heave plates which affect the accuracy of predicted drag coefficient 2 effects of spacing ratio and diameter ratio of the multiple heave plates are systematically studied by large eddy simulations the added mass coefficient c a increases as the spacing ratio increases till a critical value of spacing ratio and also increases as the diameter ratio increases the drag coefficient c d increases as the spacing ratio increases and is independent of the diameter ratio for a single heave plate c a is independent of the aspect ratio but c d decreases rapidly as the aspect ratio increases and it approaches a constant value when the aspect ratio exceeds a critical value 3 shape correction factors are proposed in the formulas of c a and c d for a single plate and double heave plates the formulas for a single heave plate with different cross sections are validated by the data in the literature and the numerical simulations in addition formulas of c a and c d for each heave plate in the double heaves are also proposed and validated by the numerical simulations in this study acknowledgement this research is carried out as a part of the

23263,many specific problems in the coastal zones require an accurate description of the wave field and knowledge of wave parameters the studies on the spectral characteristics of wind waves in the red sea are very much limited in this study the spectral characteristics of nearshore waves in the central red sea specifically the jeddah coast has been investigated utilizing a third generation spectral wave model swan the model results were validated against the available measured data the seasonal and monthly characteristics and the diurnal variability of wave spectra were analysed and discussed the wave transformation between deep intermediate and shallow water depths were assessed at three transects northern central and southern regions off jeddah the results indicate that multi directional swells are present in the jeddah nearshore regions which are propagated from the northern and southern red sea the diurnal variability in the wave spectra is persistent throughout the year although it fluctuates among the seasons according to the prevailing wind conditions significant attenuations in wave heights were identified in the intermediate and shallow waters with the highest attenuation occurred in the central jeddah coast keywords wave spectra red sea diurnal variability wave transformation jeddah coast swan 1 introduction the red sea is a semi enclosed basin located in a narrow elongated rift valley between africa and the arabian peninsula it is approximately 2250 km long and 350 km wide at the widest part it has three distinct depth zones shallow shelves of less than 50 m deep shelves having depths between 500 and 1000 m and the central axis with depths between 1000 and 2900 m rasul et al 2015 the large scale wind patterns in the red sea are primarily controlled by the seasonal characteristics and the surrounding orography patzert 1974 clifford et al 1997 sofianos and johns 2003 in the northern red sea north of about 20 n the north westerly wind blows all around the year in the southern red sea the intensity and direction of winds are mainly controlled by the arabian sea monsoon with dominant south easterlies in winter november april and north westerlies in summer there exists a convergence zone in the central red sea south of jeddah during winter where the north westerlies converge to the south easterlies that lead to very low wind speeds ralston et al 2013 these peculiarities in the wind systems reflect on the wave characteristics of the red sea langodan et al 2014 saad 2010 zubier et al 2008 ocean wave spectra refer to the distribution of the total wave variance over frequency and direction continuous measurements of wave spectra are difficult due to operational constraints whereas the validated spectral wave models can be considered as an alternative to resolve the spectral transformation in the offshore and nearshore regions the in situ wave data are very much limited in the red sea ndbc provides wave parameters from a met ocean buoy reference number 23020 deployed in a deep water location in the central red sea this data have been utilised in the previous investigations especially for the validation of offshore wave model results e g shanas et al 2017a aboobacker et al 2016 eventually numerical wave models were applied to study the seasonal and long term characteristics of the wind waves in the red sea the red sea basin often experiences the superposition of multiple wave systems and hence the basin has been categorized into distinct regions based on the dominance of superimposed non superimposed co existing waves shanas et al 2017b the jeddah coast fig 1 is one among the regions where the wind seas are often superimposed over the swells here the swells are predominantly from the northern red sea and a small contribution is from the southern red sea while the local winds are usually in the form of sea breeze and land breeze our focus is to elaborate on the spectral wave characteristics off jeddah using a calibrated nearshore spectral wave model the region is particularly interesting because of the availability of measured wave spectra for model validation and due to the complex wave wave and wave bottom interactions in this perspective we have carried out numerical wave simulations for the jeddah coast using the simulating waves nearshore swan a spectral wave model specifically designed for nearshore applications the studies based on wave model results in the red sea were mainly focused on the total wave parameters rather than the component waves such as wind seas and swells saad 2010 used the wam model for hindcasting the waves in the red sea with a relatively coarse spatial resolution the wavewatch iii ww3 model has been widely applied in the red sea for short term and long term wave hindcasting e g langodan et al 2014 aboobacker et al 2016 shanas et al 2017a 2017b the swan based models were also used for short term wave analysis e g zubier et al 2008 ralston et al 2013 fery et al 2012 2015 they are capable of resolving the shallow water processes more accurately than the offshore wave models booij et al 1999 saad 2010 gives an overall idea of the wave conditions in the red sea this study marked the under estimations of wave heights which are primarily due to the coarse resolution of model grids and input winds better predictions were obtained in the later hindcasts in the red sea with proper treatment of the source functions langodan et al 2014 which leads to reliable assessment of wave power aboobacker et al 2016 and understanding of short term and long term variability shanas et al 2017 a b zubier et al 2008 customized the swan for the first time in the red sea with a focus to implement an operational wave prediction system the follow up study analysed the sea states along the jeddah coast fery et al 2015 a comprehensive analysis of the wave conditions in the red sea were made by ralston et al 2013 which examined the impact of tokar winds in the central red sea although the wave conditions in the red sea are vastly described localised features are yet to be well understood fery et al 2015 analysed the wave parameters measured off jeddah and used them for the verification of a red sea wave model the reported average wave heights in these locations are 0 6 m and 0 4 m respectively whereas the maximum wave heights are 2 2 m and 1 2 m respectively they identified distinct diurnal variations in the wave patterns pronounced diurnal variability are limited to the coastal regions which are due to the sea breeze land breeze systems and their influence diminishes towards the offshore regions ralston et al 2013 shanas et al 2017b recently shanas et al 2018 analysed the measured wave spectra off jeddah for a limited period of time during summer and studied the wind sea and swell characteristics this data has been used in the present study for the validation of swan model results nonetheless the spatial and temporal characteristics of the wave spectra in the nearshore regions of jeddah are yet to be understood previous studies lack the discussion on the wave transformation from deep to intermediate and shallow regions off jeddah coast in this context the present study aims to explore the spectral wave characteristics off the jeddah coast using the spectral wave model swan the monthly and seasonal features have been discussed diurnal variability of the wave spectra has been particularly addressed the transformation of wave parameters from the deep to intermediate and shallow depths have been analysed considering three cross shore transects the paper has been organised as follows section 2 describes the area of study section 3 explains the data and methodology that consists of the description on the wave data collection wave model setup and validation of model results section 4 demonstrates the results and discussions and section 5 summarises the important results 2 area of study the jeddah coast lies in the central part of the red sea along the west coast of saudi arabia fig 1 the winds are predominantly from the nw wnw throughout the year however local breezes from the n to e directional sector and occasional desert winds from the se are also accountable the convergence zone developed in the south of jeddah around 18 n during winter has several implications on the met ocean parameters in the central red sea e g resulting in low wind speeds and weakens the local wind seas during summer especially during jul and aug the tokar gap winds developed in the tokar mountain ranges in the sudan blow as westerlies across the red sea these wind systems can generate high waves in the central red sea and propagate towards the saudi coasts a portion of these waves occasionally reaches the jeddah region the bathymetry off jeddah coast is complex due to the steep gradients in water depths and by the presence of coral reefs fery et al 2015 the coral and island reefs significantly reduce the wave propagation towards the coast the orography of the jeddah bay helps to reduce impact of large waves in the vicinity of the jeddah port 3 data and methodology 3 1 measured wave data the valeport midas directional wave recorder dwr and non directional and wave and tide recorder wtr were deployed at 4 5 m and 9 5 m depths respectively for the wave data collection fig 1b the directional and non directional frequency spectra were sampled over a period of 20 min during every 1 h at dwr while only the non directional frequency spectra during every 3 h were collected at wtr table 1 the instruments were configured to process the raw data in a way that includes 39 frequencies having 0 0078125 hz intervals within the frequency limit of 0 0078 0 3047 hz in dwr 180 bins of directions with 2 intervals were sorted out the accuracies of wave heights in the instruments dwr and wtr are 2 0 cm and 0 5 cm respectively valeport limited 2008 the integral wave parameters were estimated from the spectra as follows significant wave height h m 0 4 m 0 mean wave period t m 02 m 0 m 2 mean wave direction Œ∏ m a r c t a n b 1 a 1 where m0 m1 and m2 are the zero order first and second order spectral moments respectively the a1 and b1 are the fourier coefficients 3 2 wave modelling the spectral wave model swan wl delft hydraulics 2011 has been applied to simulate the waves along the jeddah coast during jun 2005 aug 2006 14 months the model takes into account of the processes like wave generation due to wind input non linear quadruplet wave wave interactions dissipation due to white capping and the shallow water effects such as bottom dissipation refraction and shoaling we refer to booij et al 1999 for a full description of the wave model fig 1b shows the wave model domain and bathymetry along the jeddah coast the shoreline data were obtained from the latest google earth the water depth data were obtained from the mike cmap a digital database provided by dhi water environment and from a survey data anonymous source the model resolution is 100 m 100 m in longitude and latitude with a total number of 134400 grids the bathymetry data were linearly interpolated to each grid element in the model domain the wave model has been initialized using jonswap spectrum and forced with the hourly cfsr wind velocities which are available at every 0 312 0 312 spatial resolution saha et al 2010 we refer to shanas et al 2017a for the verification of cfsr winds in the red sea three open boundaries were chosen in the south west and north of the model domain the open boundary conditions are the wave energy spectra derived from a red sea ww3 model hindcast shanas et al 2017a 2017b aboobacker et al 2016 fery et al 2012 2015 tested different wave growth formulations for the offshore and nearshore regions in the red sea and identified that the formulations by janssen 1991 and komen et al 1984 are better reproduced in offshore and nearshore regions respectively we applied the formulations by komen et al 1984 for the wave growth calculations in the nearshore regions of jeddah the jonswap parameterization hasselmann et al 1973 has been used for wave dissipation due to bottom friction where the calibrated value of the coefficient of friction cfjon is 0 06 the formulation by battjes and janssen 1978 has been applied for the depth induced breaking where the calibrated values of alpha and gamma are 1 and 0 64 respectively for the model computations the frequencies were discretized logarithmically with 37 bins between 0 08 hz and 0 6 hz and the directions were distributed into 36 bins with 10 intervals the possible lower frequency cut off for wind waves is 0 033 hz however the waves with less than 0 08 hz are not present in the boundary spectra the model outputs wave spectra and integral parameters have been derived for every 1 h we are considering two model setups model 1 with the same cut offs and frequency discretization as in the measurements and model 2 with relevant frequency cut offs 0 08 0 60 hz and logarithmic discretization the model 1 results have been used for the model validation whereas the model 2 results have been used for further analysis and discussion 3 3 model validation fig 2 a shows the snapshots of measured and modelled wave spectra at dwr the models were nearly predicted the peak and shape of the measured wave spectra within the available frequency range the small inconsistencies of the model spectra in the high frequency region are due to the coarse spatial resolution of the input winds applied in the offshore wave model which was carried over to the nearshore wave model boundaries nonetheless the wind sea part of the spectrum is evident in the model spectra model 2 which is obvious in the red sea coasts the energies in these lower frequencies generally fluctuate according to the local wind conditions which often leads to diurnal variability however they were partially neglected in the measured data due to the frequency cut off of around 0 30 hz fig 2b and c shows the time series comparison of measured and model 1 wave parameters the model derived significant wave height and mean wave period are in a reasonable agreement with the measurements diurnal patterns are partially apparent in the dwr data especially when the wind sea energy shifts to relatively lower frequencies however they are almost negligible in the wtr data this does not imply that the wind sea energy is not sufficiently available in this region the model 2 spectra clearly indicate the presence of wind seas in the higher frequencies in the real scenario diurnal variability is expected due to these wind sea components the error statistics estimated between the measured and model 1 wave parameters and spectra are listed in table 2 the fit is reasonable with correlation coefficients of 0 84 0 89 0 65 0 78 and r m s errors of 0 03 0 07 m 0 19 0 48 s for the significant wave heights mean wave periods the model 1 significant wave heights were slightly over estimated during low wave conditions and under estimated during relatively high wave conditions fig 2d the model 1 mean wave periods were slightly over estimated during high wave conditions these inconsistencies can be ascribed to the differences in the frequency spectra fig 2a which are due to the possible inaccuracies in the input winds the very low energy densities in the measured spectra around 0 28 0 30 hz are also leading to the mismatch in the comparison in addition the irregularities in the coastal bathymetry data due to coarse resolution may lead to errors in the estimation of energy densities especially on a region where the bathymetry slopes are steep nevertheless the accuracy of model predictions attained here is consistent with fery et al 2012 4 results and discussion 4 1 seasonal and monthly variability in the nearshore wave spectra the modelled energy densities have been averaged for seasonal and monthly analysis fig 3 shows the seasonal mean normalized 2d wave spectra at dwr and wtr here four seasons are considered summer jun sep pre winter oct nov winter dec mar and pre summer apr may the spectral distribution patterns are nearly the same in both the locations although the magnitudes are different due to the differences in water depths in the frequency domain the spectra are relatively narrow during winter whereas they are wider during the other seasons this is because the swells observed in the jeddah coast during winter are mainly propagated from the far south and the far north regions of the red sea whereas those propagated from the middle regions of the northern red sea and the local wind seas co exist during the other seasons the multi frequency multi directional components are present in the annual mean wave spectra in the nearshore regions of jeddah this is consistent with the observations of shanas et al 2017b clearly there are two distinct directional sectors w wnw and s ssw in all the seasons however dominated by the w wnw waves during summer pre winter and pre summer this is aligned with the previous investigations in the offshore regions of the red sea where the waves are predominantly in the nw nnw direction except during winter e g langodan et al 2014 shanas et al 2017b the directional shifts of these offshore waves when they approach the jeddah coast are mainly due to the wave refraction during winter the energy densities are almost equally distributed in the above directional sectors this indicates that the coastal winds along the saudi coast and the ne monsoon wind generated waves propagated from the southern red sea langodan et al 2014 are sufficiently contributing to the waves in the central red sea during winter fig 4 shows the monthly mean normalized 2d wave spectra at dwr the spectral features are nearly the same at location wtr but slightly different in magnitudes due to the depth variations well defined multi directional spectra are present during the months jul in summer and dec feb in winter in jul the secondary peak is from the s ssw direction which is due to the influence of tokar gap winds consistent with the earlier observations ralston et al 2013 langodan et al 2014 aboobacker et al 2016 in dec feb the primary peaks in the s ssw directions are associated with the swells propagated from the southern red sea due to the prevailing ne monsoon wind conditions although multi directional waves s ssw and w wnw are present in the monthly mean spectra during dec feb their coexistence are reasonably low in the real time spectra shanas et al 2017b this indicates the prevalence of one of the individual components at some point of time the wide frequency spectra during the other months mar nov reveals the coexistence of distant swells propagated from the northern red sea and the waves generated within the central red sea however both the waves are in similar directions as the forcing winds in the central and northern red sea have similar patterns 4 2 diurnal variability in the nearshore wave spectra fig 5 shows the diurnal variability in the annual mean wave spectra at dwr and wtr the maximum spectral density is during 18 20 h and the minimum is during 8 10 h during the early morning hours the peak spectral density is on a narrow banded low frequency interval 0 14 0 20 hz during which the swells are dominated while the wind seas are almost negligible during the evening hours the spread of the spectra is wide in a combination of swell and wind sea components hence the peak spectral density is in the frequency band of 0 12 0 30 hz hence superimposition occurs between the wind seas and swells during the evening hours and revert back to the swell conditions during the early morning hours the swell energies are low during the late morning and noon hours similar variability was found in the long term means of significant wave heights off jeddah fery et al 2015 and in the annual mean wave parameters significant wave height and mean wave period derived at a nearshore location north of jeddah shanas et al 2017b the regular diurnal variations in winds are due to circulations owing to large scale heat differences between land and sea which creates a corresponding variability in the nearshore waves of the jeddah coast fig 6 shows the diurnal variability in the seasonal mean wave spectra at dwr and wtr the spectral distributions are more or less the same in both the locations the peak spectral densities during the early morning hours are in a narrow frequency band representing swells which are nearly consistent in all the seasons however the peak spectra during the evening hours vary according to season the peak frequency bands during summer pre winter winter and pre summer are 0 14 0 3 hz 0 15 0 35 hz 0 12 0 25 hz and 0 13 0 3 hz respectively the winter peak frequency bands are relatively narrow indicating the dominance of swells over wind seas while the pre winter bands are wide enough to accommodate swell and winds sea energy densities here the diurnal spectra derived during the summer are consistent with that presented by shanas et al 2018 fig 7 shows the diurnal variability in the monthly mean wave spectra at dwr the spectral distributions are nearly the same at wtr the spectral shifting in different bands of frequencies especially during the evening hours are the notable features spectral spreading is relatively small during dec feb while larger during the other months swell contribution during the early morning hours is higher during nov jan well defined wind sea spectra are observed during aug and oct there exist relatively longer swells with sufficient energy in the hours 06 12 during feb which are not present during the other months this could be associated with the differences in potential swell generation regions in the northern red sea which will reflect on the arrival time of swells in the jeddah coast a detailed investigation on the potential swell generation regions in the red sea and on the estimation of swell arrival times at different parts of the red sea coasts has been proposed for a future study 4 3 nearshore wave transformation the jeddah coast is one among the steeper nearshore regions as is the case of the red sea coasts in general and compared to the coasts elsewhere considering a maximum wavelength of approx 70 m in this region the deep shallow and intermediate waters can be defined with respect to the water depths as 35 m 3 5 m 3 5 35 m respectively here we considered three transects northern central and southern regions to analyse the transformation of wave parameters from deep to shallow waters fig 8 fig 9 shows the significant wave heights at the selected deep intermediate and shallow water locations due to the effect of bottom friction the wave height reduces as it propagates from deep to shallow waters on average the reductions from deep water to intermediate and shallow water locations are around 20 and 30 respectively at the northern transect 28 and 51 respectively at the central transect and 21 and 31 respectively at the southern transect the maximum attenuation in mean hs is in the central region due to the relatively wide shallow regions dominated by denser coral reefs the reductions of maximum hs in deep water when propagate to intermediate and shallow water locations are 24 6 and 59 7 respectively at the northern transect 30 and 49 8 respectively at the central transect and 23 3 and 53 respectively at the southern transect the above figures indicate that the percentage of wave attenuation at the northern and southern regions steep slope regions are higher for the higher waves and smaller for the smaller waves while the percentage of wave attenuation in the central region gentle slope and rough bottom is nearly the same for higher and smaller waves this is one of the implications of the coral reefs where the waves attenuate significantly in any wave conditions the estimated reductions in wave heights for the jeddah coast can be considered as a typical scenario for the red sea coasts however field based investigations are required to substantiate this quantification the wave attenuations occurred along the jeddah coast is higher than that observed in most part of the world coasts however consistent with those observed in regions where the bathymetry is rough for instance the attenuation of significant wave heights from the deep to shallow waters along the goa and ratnagiri coasts is less than 10 whereas that along the dwarka coast relatively rough sea bottom is up to 22 aboobacker et al 2013 compared to the large ocean basins the wave attenuations in the red sea coasts are unique due to the absence of large and long period swells ardhuin et al 2003 identified strong attenuation of large swells and relatively weaker attenuation of smaller waves over a wider shelf in the north carolina coast the changes in mean wave period usually occur only when there is an interaction between the swells and the local wind seas within the short distance in consideration there are no significant changes in mean wave periods the systematic transformation due to shoaling and refraction is clearly visible in the mean wave direction fig 10 in the north the predominant wave direction at deep water location was around 290 while they were shifted to 275 and 265 respectively at the intermediate and shallow water locations similar variations have been found in the central and southern regions although large variations in wave directions have been observed in the deeper locations in annual cycle the waves at the shallow water locations were significantly refracted to make shore normal propagation directions 5 summary and conclusions the wave transformations in the nearshore waters of jeddah were studied by applying a third generation spectral wave model swan for the period jun 2005 may 2006 the model results were validated against available measurements and the verification is consistent with earlier studies the issue with high frequencies that are not measured by the in situ measurements and are directly related to the wind data whose accuracy is unknown is an interesting consideration for modelling the wave conditions the seasonal monthly and diurnal variability of wave spectra were analysed and discussed the results indicate that multi directional swells are present in the jeddah nearshore regions the multi directionalities are more evident in the seasonal and monthly 2d spectra with high intensities during winter especially during dec feb intense multi directional swells were observed during jul during which the s ssw swells were associated with the tokar gap winds diurnal variability is evident in the annual seasonal and monthly mean diurnal 2d wave spectra the maximum spectral density is at around 18 20 h and the minimum is around 8 10 h during the early morning hours the peak spectral density is over a narrow banded low frequency interval 0 14 0 2 hz during which the swells are dominant and the wind seas are almost absent during the evening hours the spread of the spectra is wide over a frequency band 0 12 0 3 due to the superimposition of wind seas and swells the peak frequency bands during summer pre winter winter and pre summer are 0 14 0 3 hz 0 15 0 35 hz 0 12 0 25 hz and 0 13 0 3 hz respectively the narrow winter bands indicate the dominance of swells over wind seas while the pre winter bands are wide enough to accommodate swells and winds seas with sufficient contribution significant attenuations in the wave heights were identified in the intermediate and shallow locations off jeddah 20 28 and 30 51 respectively as the waves approach from the deep water locations 600 m depth with the highest reduction in the central regions due to the presence of dense coral reefs the wave periods are not significantly altered during the wave transformation the wave direction shifts to make the shore normal propagations acknowledgements this project was funded by the deanship of scientific

23263,many specific problems in the coastal zones require an accurate description of the wave field and knowledge of wave parameters the studies on the spectral characteristics of wind waves in the red sea are very much limited in this study the spectral characteristics of nearshore waves in the central red sea specifically the jeddah coast has been investigated utilizing a third generation spectral wave model swan the model results were validated against the available measured data the seasonal and monthly characteristics and the diurnal variability of wave spectra were analysed and discussed the wave transformation between deep intermediate and shallow water depths were assessed at three transects northern central and southern regions off jeddah the results indicate that multi directional swells are present in the jeddah nearshore regions which are propagated from the northern and southern red sea the diurnal variability in the wave spectra is persistent throughout the year although it fluctuates among the seasons according to the prevailing wind conditions significant attenuations in wave heights were identified in the intermediate and shallow waters with the highest attenuation occurred in the central jeddah coast keywords wave spectra red sea diurnal variability wave transformation jeddah coast swan 1 introduction the red sea is a semi enclosed basin located in a narrow elongated rift valley between africa and the arabian peninsula it is approximately 2250 km long and 350 km wide at the widest part it has three distinct depth zones shallow shelves of less than 50 m deep shelves having depths between 500 and 1000 m and the central axis with depths between 1000 and 2900 m rasul et al 2015 the large scale wind patterns in the red sea are primarily controlled by the seasonal characteristics and the surrounding orography patzert 1974 clifford et al 1997 sofianos and johns 2003 in the northern red sea north of about 20 n the north westerly wind blows all around the year in the southern red sea the intensity and direction of winds are mainly controlled by the arabian sea monsoon with dominant south easterlies in winter november april and north westerlies in summer there exists a convergence zone in the central red sea south of jeddah during winter where the north westerlies converge to the south easterlies that lead to very low wind speeds ralston et al 2013 these peculiarities in the wind systems reflect on the wave characteristics of the red sea langodan et al 2014 saad 2010 zubier et al 2008 ocean wave spectra refer to the distribution of the total wave variance over frequency and direction continuous measurements of wave spectra are difficult due to operational constraints whereas the validated spectral wave models can be considered as an alternative to resolve the spectral transformation in the offshore and nearshore regions the in situ wave data are very much limited in the red sea ndbc provides wave parameters from a met ocean buoy reference number 23020 deployed in a deep water location in the central red sea this data have been utilised in the previous investigations especially for the validation of offshore wave model results e g shanas et al 2017a aboobacker et al 2016 eventually numerical wave models were applied to study the seasonal and long term characteristics of the wind waves in the red sea the red sea basin often experiences the superposition of multiple wave systems and hence the basin has been categorized into distinct regions based on the dominance of superimposed non superimposed co existing waves shanas et al 2017b the jeddah coast fig 1 is one among the regions where the wind seas are often superimposed over the swells here the swells are predominantly from the northern red sea and a small contribution is from the southern red sea while the local winds are usually in the form of sea breeze and land breeze our focus is to elaborate on the spectral wave characteristics off jeddah using a calibrated nearshore spectral wave model the region is particularly interesting because of the availability of measured wave spectra for model validation and due to the complex wave wave and wave bottom interactions in this perspective we have carried out numerical wave simulations for the jeddah coast using the simulating waves nearshore swan a spectral wave model specifically designed for nearshore applications the studies based on wave model results in the red sea were mainly focused on the total wave parameters rather than the component waves such as wind seas and swells saad 2010 used the wam model for hindcasting the waves in the red sea with a relatively coarse spatial resolution the wavewatch iii ww3 model has been widely applied in the red sea for short term and long term wave hindcasting e g langodan et al 2014 aboobacker et al 2016 shanas et al 2017a 2017b the swan based models were also used for short term wave analysis e g zubier et al 2008 ralston et al 2013 fery et al 2012 2015 they are capable of resolving the shallow water processes more accurately than the offshore wave models booij et al 1999 saad 2010 gives an overall idea of the wave conditions in the red sea this study marked the under estimations of wave heights which are primarily due to the coarse resolution of model grids and input winds better predictions were obtained in the later hindcasts in the red sea with proper treatment of the source functions langodan et al 2014 which leads to reliable assessment of wave power aboobacker et al 2016 and understanding of short term and long term variability shanas et al 2017 a b zubier et al 2008 customized the swan for the first time in the red sea with a focus to implement an operational wave prediction system the follow up study analysed the sea states along the jeddah coast fery et al 2015 a comprehensive analysis of the wave conditions in the red sea were made by ralston et al 2013 which examined the impact of tokar winds in the central red sea although the wave conditions in the red sea are vastly described localised features are yet to be well understood fery et al 2015 analysed the wave parameters measured off jeddah and used them for the verification of a red sea wave model the reported average wave heights in these locations are 0 6 m and 0 4 m respectively whereas the maximum wave heights are 2 2 m and 1 2 m respectively they identified distinct diurnal variations in the wave patterns pronounced diurnal variability are limited to the coastal regions which are due to the sea breeze land breeze systems and their influence diminishes towards the offshore regions ralston et al 2013 shanas et al 2017b recently shanas et al 2018 analysed the measured wave spectra off jeddah for a limited period of time during summer and studied the wind sea and swell characteristics this data has been used in the present study for the validation of swan model results nonetheless the spatial and temporal characteristics of the wave spectra in the nearshore regions of jeddah are yet to be understood previous studies lack the discussion on the wave transformation from deep to intermediate and shallow regions off jeddah coast in this context the present study aims to explore the spectral wave characteristics off the jeddah coast using the spectral wave model swan the monthly and seasonal features have been discussed diurnal variability of the wave spectra has been particularly addressed the transformation of wave parameters from the deep to intermediate and shallow depths have been analysed considering three cross shore transects the paper has been organised as follows section 2 describes the area of study section 3 explains the data and methodology that consists of the description on the wave data collection wave model setup and validation of model results section 4 demonstrates the results and discussions and section 5 summarises the important results 2 area of study the jeddah coast lies in the central part of the red sea along the west coast of saudi arabia fig 1 the winds are predominantly from the nw wnw throughout the year however local breezes from the n to e directional sector and occasional desert winds from the se are also accountable the convergence zone developed in the south of jeddah around 18 n during winter has several implications on the met ocean parameters in the central red sea e g resulting in low wind speeds and weakens the local wind seas during summer especially during jul and aug the tokar gap winds developed in the tokar mountain ranges in the sudan blow as westerlies across the red sea these wind systems can generate high waves in the central red sea and propagate towards the saudi coasts a portion of these waves occasionally reaches the jeddah region the bathymetry off jeddah coast is complex due to the steep gradients in water depths and by the presence of coral reefs fery et al 2015 the coral and island reefs significantly reduce the wave propagation towards the coast the orography of the jeddah bay helps to reduce impact of large waves in the vicinity of the jeddah port 3 data and methodology 3 1 measured wave data the valeport midas directional wave recorder dwr and non directional and wave and tide recorder wtr were deployed at 4 5 m and 9 5 m depths respectively for the wave data collection fig 1b the directional and non directional frequency spectra were sampled over a period of 20 min during every 1 h at dwr while only the non directional frequency spectra during every 3 h were collected at wtr table 1 the instruments were configured to process the raw data in a way that includes 39 frequencies having 0 0078125 hz intervals within the frequency limit of 0 0078 0 3047 hz in dwr 180 bins of directions with 2 intervals were sorted out the accuracies of wave heights in the instruments dwr and wtr are 2 0 cm and 0 5 cm respectively valeport limited 2008 the integral wave parameters were estimated from the spectra as follows significant wave height h m 0 4 m 0 mean wave period t m 02 m 0 m 2 mean wave direction Œ∏ m a r c t a n b 1 a 1 where m0 m1 and m2 are the zero order first and second order spectral moments respectively the a1 and b1 are the fourier coefficients 3 2 wave modelling the spectral wave model swan wl delft hydraulics 2011 has been applied to simulate the waves along the jeddah coast during jun 2005 aug 2006 14 months the model takes into account of the processes like wave generation due to wind input non linear quadruplet wave wave interactions dissipation due to white capping and the shallow water effects such as bottom dissipation refraction and shoaling we refer to booij et al 1999 for a full description of the wave model fig 1b shows the wave model domain and bathymetry along the jeddah coast the shoreline data were obtained from the latest google earth the water depth data were obtained from the mike cmap a digital database provided by dhi water environment and from a survey data anonymous source the model resolution is 100 m 100 m in longitude and latitude with a total number of 134400 grids the bathymetry data were linearly interpolated to each grid element in the model domain the wave model has been initialized using jonswap spectrum and forced with the hourly cfsr wind velocities which are available at every 0 312 0 312 spatial resolution saha et al 2010 we refer to shanas et al 2017a for the verification of cfsr winds in the red sea three open boundaries were chosen in the south west and north of the model domain the open boundary conditions are the wave energy spectra derived from a red sea ww3 model hindcast shanas et al 2017a 2017b aboobacker et al 2016 fery et al 2012 2015 tested different wave growth formulations for the offshore and nearshore regions in the red sea and identified that the formulations by janssen 1991 and komen et al 1984 are better reproduced in offshore and nearshore regions respectively we applied the formulations by komen et al 1984 for the wave growth calculations in the nearshore regions of jeddah the jonswap parameterization hasselmann et al 1973 has been used for wave dissipation due to bottom friction where the calibrated value of the coefficient of friction cfjon is 0 06 the formulation by battjes and janssen 1978 has been applied for the depth induced breaking where the calibrated values of alpha and gamma are 1 and 0 64 respectively for the model computations the frequencies were discretized logarithmically with 37 bins between 0 08 hz and 0 6 hz and the directions were distributed into 36 bins with 10 intervals the possible lower frequency cut off for wind waves is 0 033 hz however the waves with less than 0 08 hz are not present in the boundary spectra the model outputs wave spectra and integral parameters have been derived for every 1 h we are considering two model setups model 1 with the same cut offs and frequency discretization as in the measurements and model 2 with relevant frequency cut offs 0 08 0 60 hz and logarithmic discretization the model 1 results have been used for the model validation whereas the model 2 results have been used for further analysis and discussion 3 3 model validation fig 2 a shows the snapshots of measured and modelled wave spectra at dwr the models were nearly predicted the peak and shape of the measured wave spectra within the available frequency range the small inconsistencies of the model spectra in the high frequency region are due to the coarse spatial resolution of the input winds applied in the offshore wave model which was carried over to the nearshore wave model boundaries nonetheless the wind sea part of the spectrum is evident in the model spectra model 2 which is obvious in the red sea coasts the energies in these lower frequencies generally fluctuate according to the local wind conditions which often leads to diurnal variability however they were partially neglected in the measured data due to the frequency cut off of around 0 30 hz fig 2b and c shows the time series comparison of measured and model 1 wave parameters the model derived significant wave height and mean wave period are in a reasonable agreement with the measurements diurnal patterns are partially apparent in the dwr data especially when the wind sea energy shifts to relatively lower frequencies however they are almost negligible in the wtr data this does not imply that the wind sea energy is not sufficiently available in this region the model 2 spectra clearly indicate the presence of wind seas in the higher frequencies in the real scenario diurnal variability is expected due to these wind sea components the error statistics estimated between the measured and model 1 wave parameters and spectra are listed in table 2 the fit is reasonable with correlation coefficients of 0 84 0 89 0 65 0 78 and r m s errors of 0 03 0 07 m 0 19 0 48 s for the significant wave heights mean wave periods the model 1 significant wave heights were slightly over estimated during low wave conditions and under estimated during relatively high wave conditions fig 2d the model 1 mean wave periods were slightly over estimated during high wave conditions these inconsistencies can be ascribed to the differences in the frequency spectra fig 2a which are due to the possible inaccuracies in the input winds the very low energy densities in the measured spectra around 0 28 0 30 hz are also leading to the mismatch in the comparison in addition the irregularities in the coastal bathymetry data due to coarse resolution may lead to errors in the estimation of energy densities especially on a region where the bathymetry slopes are steep nevertheless the accuracy of model predictions attained here is consistent with fery et al 2012 4 results and discussion 4 1 seasonal and monthly variability in the nearshore wave spectra the modelled energy densities have been averaged for seasonal and monthly analysis fig 3 shows the seasonal mean normalized 2d wave spectra at dwr and wtr here four seasons are considered summer jun sep pre winter oct nov winter dec mar and pre summer apr may the spectral distribution patterns are nearly the same in both the locations although the magnitudes are different due to the differences in water depths in the frequency domain the spectra are relatively narrow during winter whereas they are wider during the other seasons this is because the swells observed in the jeddah coast during winter are mainly propagated from the far south and the far north regions of the red sea whereas those propagated from the middle regions of the northern red sea and the local wind seas co exist during the other seasons the multi frequency multi directional components are present in the annual mean wave spectra in the nearshore regions of jeddah this is consistent with the observations of shanas et al 2017b clearly there are two distinct directional sectors w wnw and s ssw in all the seasons however dominated by the w wnw waves during summer pre winter and pre summer this is aligned with the previous investigations in the offshore regions of the red sea where the waves are predominantly in the nw nnw direction except during winter e g langodan et al 2014 shanas et al 2017b the directional shifts of these offshore waves when they approach the jeddah coast are mainly due to the wave refraction during winter the energy densities are almost equally distributed in the above directional sectors this indicates that the coastal winds along the saudi coast and the ne monsoon wind generated waves propagated from the southern red sea langodan et al 2014 are sufficiently contributing to the waves in the central red sea during winter fig 4 shows the monthly mean normalized 2d wave spectra at dwr the spectral features are nearly the same at location wtr but slightly different in magnitudes due to the depth variations well defined multi directional spectra are present during the months jul in summer and dec feb in winter in jul the secondary peak is from the s ssw direction which is due to the influence of tokar gap winds consistent with the earlier observations ralston et al 2013 langodan et al 2014 aboobacker et al 2016 in dec feb the primary peaks in the s ssw directions are associated with the swells propagated from the southern red sea due to the prevailing ne monsoon wind conditions although multi directional waves s ssw and w wnw are present in the monthly mean spectra during dec feb their coexistence are reasonably low in the real time spectra shanas et al 2017b this indicates the prevalence of one of the individual components at some point of time the wide frequency spectra during the other months mar nov reveals the coexistence of distant swells propagated from the northern red sea and the waves generated within the central red sea however both the waves are in similar directions as the forcing winds in the central and northern red sea have similar patterns 4 2 diurnal variability in the nearshore wave spectra fig 5 shows the diurnal variability in the annual mean wave spectra at dwr and wtr the maximum spectral density is during 18 20 h and the minimum is during 8 10 h during the early morning hours the peak spectral density is on a narrow banded low frequency interval 0 14 0 20 hz during which the swells are dominated while the wind seas are almost negligible during the evening hours the spread of the spectra is wide in a combination of swell and wind sea components hence the peak spectral density is in the frequency band of 0 12 0 30 hz hence superimposition occurs between the wind seas and swells during the evening hours and revert back to the swell conditions during the early morning hours the swell energies are low during the late morning and noon hours similar variability was found in the long term means of significant wave heights off jeddah fery et al 2015 and in the annual mean wave parameters significant wave height and mean wave period derived at a nearshore location north of jeddah shanas et al 2017b the regular diurnal variations in winds are due to circulations owing to large scale heat differences between land and sea which creates a corresponding variability in the nearshore waves of the jeddah coast fig 6 shows the diurnal variability in the seasonal mean wave spectra at dwr and wtr the spectral distributions are more or less the same in both the locations the peak spectral densities during the early morning hours are in a narrow frequency band representing swells which are nearly consistent in all the seasons however the peak spectra during the evening hours vary according to season the peak frequency bands during summer pre winter winter and pre summer are 0 14 0 3 hz 0 15 0 35 hz 0 12 0 25 hz and 0 13 0 3 hz respectively the winter peak frequency bands are relatively narrow indicating the dominance of swells over wind seas while the pre winter bands are wide enough to accommodate swell and winds sea energy densities here the diurnal spectra derived during the summer are consistent with that presented by shanas et al 2018 fig 7 shows the diurnal variability in the monthly mean wave spectra at dwr the spectral distributions are nearly the same at wtr the spectral shifting in different bands of frequencies especially during the evening hours are the notable features spectral spreading is relatively small during dec feb while larger during the other months swell contribution during the early morning hours is higher during nov jan well defined wind sea spectra are observed during aug and oct there exist relatively longer swells with sufficient energy in the hours 06 12 during feb which are not present during the other months this could be associated with the differences in potential swell generation regions in the northern red sea which will reflect on the arrival time of swells in the jeddah coast a detailed investigation on the potential swell generation regions in the red sea and on the estimation of swell arrival times at different parts of the red sea coasts has been proposed for a future study 4 3 nearshore wave transformation the jeddah coast is one among the steeper nearshore regions as is the case of the red sea coasts in general and compared to the coasts elsewhere considering a maximum wavelength of approx 70 m in this region the deep shallow and intermediate waters can be defined with respect to the water depths as 35 m 3 5 m 3 5 35 m respectively here we considered three transects northern central and southern regions to analyse the transformation of wave parameters from deep to shallow waters fig 8 fig 9 shows the significant wave heights at the selected deep intermediate and shallow water locations due to the effect of bottom friction the wave height reduces as it propagates from deep to shallow waters on average the reductions from deep water to intermediate and shallow water locations are around 20 and 30 respectively at the northern transect 28 and 51 respectively at the central transect and 21 and 31 respectively at the southern transect the maximum attenuation in mean hs is in the central region due to the relatively wide shallow regions dominated by denser coral reefs the reductions of maximum hs in deep water when propagate to intermediate and shallow water locations are 24 6 and 59 7 respectively at the northern transect 30 and 49 8 respectively at the central transect and 23 3 and 53 respectively at the southern transect the above figures indicate that the percentage of wave attenuation at the northern and southern regions steep slope regions are higher for the higher waves and smaller for the smaller waves while the percentage of wave attenuation in the central region gentle slope and rough bottom is nearly the same for higher and smaller waves this is one of the implications of the coral reefs where the waves attenuate significantly in any wave conditions the estimated reductions in wave heights for the jeddah coast can be considered as a typical scenario for the red sea coasts however field based investigations are required to substantiate this quantification the wave attenuations occurred along the jeddah coast is higher than that observed in most part of the world coasts however consistent with those observed in regions where the bathymetry is rough for instance the attenuation of significant wave heights from the deep to shallow waters along the goa and ratnagiri coasts is less than 10 whereas that along the dwarka coast relatively rough sea bottom is up to 22 aboobacker et al 2013 compared to the large ocean basins the wave attenuations in the red sea coasts are unique due to the absence of large and long period swells ardhuin et al 2003 identified strong attenuation of large swells and relatively weaker attenuation of smaller waves over a wider shelf in the north carolina coast the changes in mean wave period usually occur only when there is an interaction between the swells and the local wind seas within the short distance in consideration there are no significant changes in mean wave periods the systematic transformation due to shoaling and refraction is clearly visible in the mean wave direction fig 10 in the north the predominant wave direction at deep water location was around 290 while they were shifted to 275 and 265 respectively at the intermediate and shallow water locations similar variations have been found in the central and southern regions although large variations in wave directions have been observed in the deeper locations in annual cycle the waves at the shallow water locations were significantly refracted to make shore normal propagation directions 5 summary and conclusions the wave transformations in the nearshore waters of jeddah were studied by applying a third generation spectral wave model swan for the period jun 2005 may 2006 the model results were validated against available measurements and the verification is consistent with earlier studies the issue with high frequencies that are not measured by the in situ measurements and are directly related to the wind data whose accuracy is unknown is an interesting consideration for modelling the wave conditions the seasonal monthly and diurnal variability of wave spectra were analysed and discussed the results indicate that multi directional swells are present in the jeddah nearshore regions the multi directionalities are more evident in the seasonal and monthly 2d spectra with high intensities during winter especially during dec feb intense multi directional swells were observed during jul during which the s ssw swells were associated with the tokar gap winds diurnal variability is evident in the annual seasonal and monthly mean diurnal 2d wave spectra the maximum spectral density is at around 18 20 h and the minimum is around 8 10 h during the early morning hours the peak spectral density is over a narrow banded low frequency interval 0 14 0 2 hz during which the swells are dominant and the wind seas are almost absent during the evening hours the spread of the spectra is wide over a frequency band 0 12 0 3 due to the superimposition of wind seas and swells the peak frequency bands during summer pre winter winter and pre summer are 0 14 0 3 hz 0 15 0 35 hz 0 12 0 25 hz and 0 13 0 3 hz respectively the narrow winter bands indicate the dominance of swells over wind seas while the pre winter bands are wide enough to accommodate swells and winds seas with sufficient contribution significant attenuations in the wave heights were identified in the intermediate and shallow locations off jeddah 20 28 and 30 51 respectively as the waves approach from the deep water locations 600 m depth with the highest reduction in the central regions due to the presence of dense coral reefs the wave periods are not significantly altered during the wave transformation the wave direction shifts to make the shore normal propagations acknowledgements this project was funded by the deanship of scientific

23264,although the significant wave period is one of the key parameters in the design of coastal structures it is not calculated by the spectral wave model because it is obtained by the zero crossing analysis the present paper examines several formulas that relate the significant wave period to wave spectral parameters such as peak period mean period and peakedness parameter the formulas are derived based on the wave measurements in two locations in the japan east sea jes the derived formulas are then compared with the measured significant wave periods in other locations in jes it is shown that the formula using the mean wave period t m 1 0 is the most accurate this formula is further used in a spectral wave model the significant wave periods from which are compared with the measurement additionally the relationship between the significant wave height and period is obtained based on the wave hindcasting from which the most probable significant wave period can be determined for a specific significant wave height a comparison with the measurement shows that the relationship is relatively inaccurate in the locations where southerly swell waves are significant which are not accurately taken into account in the numerical model graphical abstract image 1 keywords significant wave height significant wave period wave spectral parameters spectral wave model zero crossing analysis 1 introduction the zero crossing and spectrum analyses give the wave parameters but wave heights and periods from the two methods are different to each other however assuming the narrow banded process the significant wave height from the spectrum analysis h m 0 is equivalent to that of zero crossing analysis h 1 3 additionally the average zero crossing period t z can be expressed in terms of the spectral moments which is t m 02 m 0 m 2 1 2 bitner gregerson and magnusson 2004 cartwright and longuet higgins 1956 longuet higgins 1952 thornton and guza 1983 here the n th order moment of wave spectrum is m n 0 f n s f d f due to the equivalence in the mean wave periods cherneva et al 2008 have compared the mean wave period from the wave hindcasting to the measurement on the other hand even though the significant wave period from the zero crossing analysis t 1 3 is used in the design of coastal structures goda 2010 the spectral wave model cannot predict the significant wave period for this reason several researchers tried to estimate the significant wave period with the wave spectral parameters among them takahashi et al 1979 proposed an empirical formula t 1 3 t m 02 1 1 similarly suh et al 2010 predicted the significant wave period with the formula t 1 3 t m 02 1 14 meanwhile goda 2010 stated that t 1 3 t p was similar to t m 1 0 t p here t p denotes the peak wave period and t m 1 0 is defined as m 1 m 0 which is provided as the mean wave period in the wam model g√ºnther et al 1992 in addition to this goda 2010 related the ratio t 1 3 t p to the peak enhancement factor of jonswap joint north sea wave observation project wave spectrum Œ≥ j and the power of frequency in huang et al s 1981 wallops wave spectrum m w however since not all wave spectra fit to jonswap or wallops wave spectrum goda s 2010 formula cannot be applied to all wave spectra besides the accuracies of the previously stated formulas have not been compared to each other despite of its importance for this reason several formulas on the significant wave period from the wave spectral parameters t s are proposed in this study which were derived from two wave measurements in the japan east sea jes the formulas are compared with other wave measurements in jes after that the most accurate one is then applied to chun and ahn s 2017 wave hindcasting to improve the accuracy in the significant wave periods furthermore the relationship between the significant wave height and period in the jes is established based on the wave hindcasting 2 formulas for significant wave period 2 1 wave measurements in the japan east sea jes in the present study the formulas on the significant wave period are examined using the wave measurements in the jes fig 1 due to this the wave spectral parameters should be given but they are not available in all the measurement stations in particular the wave measurements at pohang hamada and niigata do not provide the wave spectral parameters for this reason the wave data at each station were used for different purposes of the wave measurements the three dimensional wave displacements are given at koga e1 and koga s2 which were measured with the wave buoys having the sampling frequency of 2 hz by applying the zero crossing and fft fast fourier transform analyses to the wave displacements the significant wave period and wave spectral parameters were obtained then three formulas for the significant wave period were derived in terms of the wave spectral parameters on the other hand the wave measurements at hupo and sokcho also provide the wave spectral parameters however the waves at these stations have been measured by the bottom mounted wave equipment which has problems such as signal attenuation the accuracy of the bottom mounted wave equipment is not so good as that of buoy equipment even though the equipment has been improved in these days accordingly the wave data at these stations were used to validate the formulas without being included in the derivation of the formulas meanwhile the significant wave periods measured at pohang hamada and niigata where the wave spectral parameters are not given are compared with the computed values from chun and ahn s 2017 wave hindcasting model 2 2 estimation of significant wave period based on wave spectral parameters in the present study the ratio t 1 3 t p is expressed as a function of q p as follows 1 t 1 3 t p a q p 1 b where q p denotes goda s 1970 peakedness parameter its form was given as q p 2 m 0 2 0 f s 2 f d f since q p can be evaluated for any wave spectrum and it is linearly related to Œ≥ j see appendix it is employed in eq 1 the coefficients in eq 1 were estimated as a 0 8 and b 0 08 respectively by the least square method fig 2 a shows that the significant wave period calculated by eq 1 well agrees with the measurement the accuracy of eq 1 is presented in table 1 in terms of several statistical parameters such as bias root mean square error rmse scatter index si pearson s correlation coefficient r and willmott s 1981 index of agreement of the statistical quantities the descriptions on bias rmse si and r are given in pilar et al 2008 here the bias is calculated by subtracting the predicted value from the measurement therefore the minus sign in the bias indicates overestimation of the prediction formula the pearson s correlation coefficient measures the linear relationship between two data hirsh et al 1993 and it is more sensitive to outliers than to observations near the means legates and mccabe 1999 on the other hand the willmott s index of agreement measures the degree to which the formula s predictions are error free but not the correlation between prediction and measurement it varies between 0 and 1 0 where 1 0 indicates perfect agreement and 0 connotes complete disagreement meanwhile as shown by suh et al 2010 and takahashi et al 1979 the ratio t 1 3 t m 02 is almost constant from the wave measurements it is written as 2 t 1 3 t m 02 1 12 fig 2 b shows that the significant wave period calculated by eq 2 is somewhat scattered and underestimated as eq 2 is equal to the average of the formulas of suh et al 2010 and takahashi et al 1979 it was compared with those formulas fig 2 b while the rmses of takahashi et al 1979 and suh et al 2010 are 0 65 s and 0 63 s respectively the rmse of eq 2 is 0 62 s on the other hand the statistical parameters in table 1 indicate that the prediction by eq 2 is worse than that by eq 1 the significant wave period t 1 3 is also related to the mean wave period t m 1 0 according to fig 3 a t m 1 0 is highly correlated with t 1 3 but it is 0 47 s larger than t 1 3 on average accordingly the relationship between t 1 3 and t m 1 0 was assumed as 3 t 1 3 c t m 1 0 d where the coefficients c and d were estimated as 0 76 and 1 11 respectively again by the least square method fig 3 b compares the significant wave period calculated by eq 3 with the measurement showing that the predicted values well agree with the measurement and the scattering is much smaller than other formulas table 1 also shows that eq 3 is more accurate than other formulas even though it slightly more overestimates than eq 1 2 3 validation of the formulas using other wave measurement data the formulas derived in the previous section are validated by comparing the calculated significant wave periods with the measurements at hupo and sokcho which were not used in the derivation of the formulas fig 4 shows a comparison between the predicted and measured significant wave periods and the accuracy of the prediction formulas are given in table 2 all the values of bias in table 2 are positive indicating that all the formulas underestimate the significant wave period as can be seen in fig 4 as well however eq 3 gives the smallest bias other statistical parameters also indicate that eq 3 is more accurate than other formulas based on the results given in tables 1 and 2 it is concluded that eq 3 is the most accurate formula to predict the significant wave period from wave spectral parameters this formula is therefore used to calculate the significant wave period in the wave hindcasting model described in the next section on the other hand the rmse of the significant wave period by eq 3 for the wave data in tables 1 and 2 is 0 52 s and the average significant wave period is 5 79 s from this the uncertainty of eq 3 is estimated as 8 9 in addition to this since t p is also used as the reference wave period the significant wave period by eq 3 is compared with t p in this study fig 5 shows that t s is 1 38 s smaller than t p on average t 1 3 is also smaller than t p but the average value of t 1 3 t p 0 87 is larger than that of t s t p 0 80 due to the underestimation in the significant wave period by eq 3 3 prediction of significant wave period in wave hindcasting model 3 1 estimation of significant wave periods in wave hindcasting chun and ahn 2017 conducted wave hindcasting in the jes from 1995 to 2014 using the modified wam which had been extended to the shallow water the spatial grid size in the numerical experiment is 1 12 for the computational efficiency the significant wave period was estimated by suh et al s 2010 formula t s 1 14 t m 02 in this study the significant wave period is calculated by eq 3 to see its applicability in a wave hindcasting model comparisons between the predicted and measured significant wave periods are given in fig 6 and table 3 fig 6 shows that the predicted significant wave periods well agree with the measurements but the significant wave periods at pohang and hamada are somewhat overestimated due to the overestimation the rmses of eq 3 at these stations are larger than those of t s 1 14 t m 02 leading to lower indices of agreement see table 3 however the pearson s correlation coefficients of eq 3 at these sites are larger than those of t s 1 14 t m 02 because of the smaller sis on the other hand the average value of rmses of eq 3 is 0 17 s smaller than that of t s 1 14 t m 02 the average value of si of eq 3 is also smaller than that of t s 1 14 t m 02 from this it can be concluded that the accuracy of computed significant wave periods in wave hindcasting has been improved by using eq 3 instead of t s 1 14 t m 02 meanwhile table 3 shows that the rmse and si of computed significant wave period in chun and ahn s 2017 wave hindcasting are 0 94 s and 0 16 respectively these quantities are about two and four times respectively larger than those in table 2 probably because the errors were from predicting significant wave period and the numerical computation here the uncertainty in the newly predicted significant wave period of chun and ahn s 2017 numerical model is 16 2 comparing it with the uncertainty in predicting significant wave period it can be seen that the uncertainty in the numerical model is 7 3 despite of the numerical errors the pearson s correlation coefficients and indices of agreement for significant wave period in the wave hindcasting model range 0 72 0 92 and 0 82 0 96 respectively the accuracy in the significant wave period predicted by the present formula is comparable to those of cherneva et al 2008 and pilar et al 2008 the pearson s correlation coefficients of cherneva et al s 2008 peak period and pilar et al s 2008 mean period were 0 55 0 88 and 0 69 0 88 respectively on 23 february 2008 high waves have hit the east coast of korea to claim several human lives at the gangneung port the high waves at the gangneung port were successfully reproduced by chun and ahn 2017 and lee et al 2010 meanwhile the waves also damaged the west coast of japan lee et al 2010 to further examine the accuracy of the present formula in a wave hindcasting model the predicted and measured waves at hamada and niigata are compared in figs 7 and 8 respectively the significant wave period calculated by t s 1 14 t m 02 is also presented fig 7 shows that chun and ahn s 2017 model successfully reproduces the storm waves at hamada the calculated maximum significant wave height is 5 35 m while the measured value is 5 39 m when the significant wave height reaches at its maximum the predicted and measured significant wave periods are 9 79 s and 9 5 s respectively indicating good agreement between them the predicted and measured significant wave periods show good agreement during the entire storm period except the decaying period of the storm when both significant wave height and period are slightly underestimated meanwhile the significant wave period calculated by t s 1 14 t m 02 is slightly overestimated during the entire storm period except the decaying period of the storm the calculated storm waves at niigata are also in good agreement with the measurement as shown in fig 8 even though the numerical results at the storm s peak were not validated due to the lack of measurements unlike at hamada both wave height and period are overestimated during the decaying period of the storm the significant wave period calculated by t s 1 14 t m 02 is again overestimated during the entire storm period 3 2 relationship between significant wave height and period in the jes when determining the design wave the wave height is estimated by the extreme wave analysis and the wave period is obtained from the relationship between the significant wave height and period goda 2003 suh et al 2010 it is common to obtain the relationship from extreme wave data such as annual maximum waves however the storm waves with the return period less than one year frequently damage the coastal zone around the jes and low energy long period waves cause the rip currents on the beach brander and short 2010 therefore the relationship between the significant wave height and period is established for ordinary waves with a small return period with the same approach as previous studies the significant wave period is expressed as a function of significant wave height as follows 4 t s Œ± h m 0 Œ≤ where h m 0 and t s are given in meters and seconds respectively in eq 4 Œ± and Œ≤ are the coefficients to be determined by applying the least square method to chun and ahn s 2017 numerical results where the significant wave period was estimated by eq 3 the significant wave period calculated by eq 4 is different from that calculated by eq 3 in that the former is the most probable significant wave period for a specific wave height after determining the coefficients the relationships between the significant wave height and period at several sites around the jes are presented in fig 9 where the significant wave height and period from the measurements are also shown to see the agreement with the relationships for a quantitative comparison the indices of agreement between the most probable and measured significant wave periods are also presented in fig 9 which range between 0 65 and 0 87 these values are different from those in table 3 the index of agreement in fig 9 measures the agreement between the most probable significant wave period calculated by eq 4 and the measured significant wave period whereas the index of agreement in table 3 measures the agreement between the significant wave period calculated by eq 3 and the measured wave period the index of agreement is relatively small at koga s2 pohang and hupo where the effect of southerly swell waves is significant but it was not calculated accurately in the numerical model the coefficients Œ± and Œ≤ from the present analysis are presented in figure 10 and 11 respectively the coefficient Œ± ranges from 4 to 6 5 being relatively large along the east coast of korean peninsula and the west coast of japan with a little larger values along the japanese coast due to the northwesterly wind on the other hand the values are smaller than 5 along the south coast of korean peninsula because it is so close to the southern boundary of the numerical model that the waves were not developed enough meanwhile the coefficient Œ≤ in the jes ranges from 0 15 to 0 35 as shown in figure 11 the values of Œ≤ near the west coast of japan are somewhat larger than those near the east coast of korea again by the action of northwesterly wind furthermore the coefficients are relatively small near the boundary of the numerical model where the waves were not developed enough because the yellow sea is not the target area of the numerical model its entire area was not covered so relatively smaller coefficients were calculated there 4 conclusion in this paper examinations were made for three formulas that calculate the significant wave period in terms of the wave spectral parameters the coefficients of the formulas were determined by analyzing the three dimensional water surface displacements from the buoy measurements in the jes the derived formulas were then compared with wave measurement data at other locations in the jes the formula t s 0 76 t m 1 0 1 11 was proven to be the most accurate the selected formula was employed in chun and ahn s 2017 wave hindcasting model where suh et al s 2010 formula had been previously used to estimate the significant wave period a comparison with the measurement data at seven locations around the jes showed that the new formula is more accurate than the previous one on the other hand even though the predicted significant wave period well agrees with the measured one the generality of the present formula is limited to the jes because it has been validated against the wave measurements in the jes in the future study its applicability to the other region would be shown the new formula was also used to derive the formula for calculating the most probable significant wave period for a specific significant wave height from the results of chun and ahn s 2017 numerical model the coefficients of t s Œ± h m 0 Œ≤ in the entire area of the jes were presented in figs 10 and 11 the equation was compared with the measurement data at seven locations in the jes to show reasonable agreement except several locations where the effect of southerly swell waves were significant which were not calculated accurately in the numerical model appendix relationship between q p and h s t p and Œ≥ j as sorensen 1993 stated q p for wind wave and swell ahn et al 2013 simulated wave spectra having the form of jonwap to characterize the swell waves in the jes they obtained the parameters of jonswap wave spectrum h s t p and Œ≥ j by sampling from the probability density at hupo from the simulation it was found that q p is not related to h s and t p but there is a strong relationship between q p and Œ≥ j fig 12 the correlation coefficients between q p and the parameters of jonswap wave spectrum h s t p and Œ≥ j were 0 01 0 01 and 0 99 respectively accordingly the ratio t 1 3 t p was related to q p in the present study fig 12 the relationships between q p and the parameters of jonswap wave spectrum a relationship between h s and q p b relationship between t p and q p c relationship between Œ≥ j and q p fig 12 
23264,although the significant wave period is one of the key parameters in the design of coastal structures it is not calculated by the spectral wave model because it is obtained by the zero crossing analysis the present paper examines several formulas that relate the significant wave period to wave spectral parameters such as peak period mean period and peakedness parameter the formulas are derived based on the wave measurements in two locations in the japan east sea jes the derived formulas are then compared with the measured significant wave periods in other locations in jes it is shown that the formula using the mean wave period t m 1 0 is the most accurate this formula is further used in a spectral wave model the significant wave periods from which are compared with the measurement additionally the relationship between the significant wave height and period is obtained based on the wave hindcasting from which the most probable significant wave period can be determined for a specific significant wave height a comparison with the measurement shows that the relationship is relatively inaccurate in the locations where southerly swell waves are significant which are not accurately taken into account in the numerical model graphical abstract image 1 keywords significant wave height significant wave period wave spectral parameters spectral wave model zero crossing analysis 1 introduction the zero crossing and spectrum analyses give the wave parameters but wave heights and periods from the two methods are different to each other however assuming the narrow banded process the significant wave height from the spectrum analysis h m 0 is equivalent to that of zero crossing analysis h 1 3 additionally the average zero crossing period t z can be expressed in terms of the spectral moments which is t m 02 m 0 m 2 1 2 bitner gregerson and magnusson 2004 cartwright and longuet higgins 1956 longuet higgins 1952 thornton and guza 1983 here the n th order moment of wave spectrum is m n 0 f n s f d f due to the equivalence in the mean wave periods cherneva et al 2008 have compared the mean wave period from the wave hindcasting to the measurement on the other hand even though the significant wave period from the zero crossing analysis t 1 3 is used in the design of coastal structures goda 2010 the spectral wave model cannot predict the significant wave period for this reason several researchers tried to estimate the significant wave period with the wave spectral parameters among them takahashi et al 1979 proposed an empirical formula t 1 3 t m 02 1 1 similarly suh et al 2010 predicted the significant wave period with the formula t 1 3 t m 02 1 14 meanwhile goda 2010 stated that t 1 3 t p was similar to t m 1 0 t p here t p denotes the peak wave period and t m 1 0 is defined as m 1 m 0 which is provided as the mean wave period in the wam model g√ºnther et al 1992 in addition to this goda 2010 related the ratio t 1 3 t p to the peak enhancement factor of jonswap joint north sea wave observation project wave spectrum Œ≥ j and the power of frequency in huang et al s 1981 wallops wave spectrum m w however since not all wave spectra fit to jonswap or wallops wave spectrum goda s 2010 formula cannot be applied to all wave spectra besides the accuracies of the previously stated formulas have not been compared to each other despite of its importance for this reason several formulas on the significant wave period from the wave spectral parameters t s are proposed in this study which were derived from two wave measurements in the japan east sea jes the formulas are compared with other wave measurements in jes after that the most accurate one is then applied to chun and ahn s 2017 wave hindcasting to improve the accuracy in the significant wave periods furthermore the relationship between the significant wave height and period in the jes is established based on the wave hindcasting 2 formulas for significant wave period 2 1 wave measurements in the japan east sea jes in the present study the formulas on the significant wave period are examined using the wave measurements in the jes fig 1 due to this the wave spectral parameters should be given but they are not available in all the measurement stations in particular the wave measurements at pohang hamada and niigata do not provide the wave spectral parameters for this reason the wave data at each station were used for different purposes of the wave measurements the three dimensional wave displacements are given at koga e1 and koga s2 which were measured with the wave buoys having the sampling frequency of 2 hz by applying the zero crossing and fft fast fourier transform analyses to the wave displacements the significant wave period and wave spectral parameters were obtained then three formulas for the significant wave period were derived in terms of the wave spectral parameters on the other hand the wave measurements at hupo and sokcho also provide the wave spectral parameters however the waves at these stations have been measured by the bottom mounted wave equipment which has problems such as signal attenuation the accuracy of the bottom mounted wave equipment is not so good as that of buoy equipment even though the equipment has been improved in these days accordingly the wave data at these stations were used to validate the formulas without being included in the derivation of the formulas meanwhile the significant wave periods measured at pohang hamada and niigata where the wave spectral parameters are not given are compared with the computed values from chun and ahn s 2017 wave hindcasting model 2 2 estimation of significant wave period based on wave spectral parameters in the present study the ratio t 1 3 t p is expressed as a function of q p as follows 1 t 1 3 t p a q p 1 b where q p denotes goda s 1970 peakedness parameter its form was given as q p 2 m 0 2 0 f s 2 f d f since q p can be evaluated for any wave spectrum and it is linearly related to Œ≥ j see appendix it is employed in eq 1 the coefficients in eq 1 were estimated as a 0 8 and b 0 08 respectively by the least square method fig 2 a shows that the significant wave period calculated by eq 1 well agrees with the measurement the accuracy of eq 1 is presented in table 1 in terms of several statistical parameters such as bias root mean square error rmse scatter index si pearson s correlation coefficient r and willmott s 1981 index of agreement of the statistical quantities the descriptions on bias rmse si and r are given in pilar et al 2008 here the bias is calculated by subtracting the predicted value from the measurement therefore the minus sign in the bias indicates overestimation of the prediction formula the pearson s correlation coefficient measures the linear relationship between two data hirsh et al 1993 and it is more sensitive to outliers than to observations near the means legates and mccabe 1999 on the other hand the willmott s index of agreement measures the degree to which the formula s predictions are error free but not the correlation between prediction and measurement it varies between 0 and 1 0 where 1 0 indicates perfect agreement and 0 connotes complete disagreement meanwhile as shown by suh et al 2010 and takahashi et al 1979 the ratio t 1 3 t m 02 is almost constant from the wave measurements it is written as 2 t 1 3 t m 02 1 12 fig 2 b shows that the significant wave period calculated by eq 2 is somewhat scattered and underestimated as eq 2 is equal to the average of the formulas of suh et al 2010 and takahashi et al 1979 it was compared with those formulas fig 2 b while the rmses of takahashi et al 1979 and suh et al 2010 are 0 65 s and 0 63 s respectively the rmse of eq 2 is 0 62 s on the other hand the statistical parameters in table 1 indicate that the prediction by eq 2 is worse than that by eq 1 the significant wave period t 1 3 is also related to the mean wave period t m 1 0 according to fig 3 a t m 1 0 is highly correlated with t 1 3 but it is 0 47 s larger than t 1 3 on average accordingly the relationship between t 1 3 and t m 1 0 was assumed as 3 t 1 3 c t m 1 0 d where the coefficients c and d were estimated as 0 76 and 1 11 respectively again by the least square method fig 3 b compares the significant wave period calculated by eq 3 with the measurement showing that the predicted values well agree with the measurement and the scattering is much smaller than other formulas table 1 also shows that eq 3 is more accurate than other formulas even though it slightly more overestimates than eq 1 2 3 validation of the formulas using other wave measurement data the formulas derived in the previous section are validated by comparing the calculated significant wave periods with the measurements at hupo and sokcho which were not used in the derivation of the formulas fig 4 shows a comparison between the predicted and measured significant wave periods and the accuracy of the prediction formulas are given in table 2 all the values of bias in table 2 are positive indicating that all the formulas underestimate the significant wave period as can be seen in fig 4 as well however eq 3 gives the smallest bias other statistical parameters also indicate that eq 3 is more accurate than other formulas based on the results given in tables 1 and 2 it is concluded that eq 3 is the most accurate formula to predict the significant wave period from wave spectral parameters this formula is therefore used to calculate the significant wave period in the wave hindcasting model described in the next section on the other hand the rmse of the significant wave period by eq 3 for the wave data in tables 1 and 2 is 0 52 s and the average significant wave period is 5 79 s from this the uncertainty of eq 3 is estimated as 8 9 in addition to this since t p is also used as the reference wave period the significant wave period by eq 3 is compared with t p in this study fig 5 shows that t s is 1 38 s smaller than t p on average t 1 3 is also smaller than t p but the average value of t 1 3 t p 0 87 is larger than that of t s t p 0 80 due to the underestimation in the significant wave period by eq 3 3 prediction of significant wave period in wave hindcasting model 3 1 estimation of significant wave periods in wave hindcasting chun and ahn 2017 conducted wave hindcasting in the jes from 1995 to 2014 using the modified wam which had been extended to the shallow water the spatial grid size in the numerical experiment is 1 12 for the computational efficiency the significant wave period was estimated by suh et al s 2010 formula t s 1 14 t m 02 in this study the significant wave period is calculated by eq 3 to see its applicability in a wave hindcasting model comparisons between the predicted and measured significant wave periods are given in fig 6 and table 3 fig 6 shows that the predicted significant wave periods well agree with the measurements but the significant wave periods at pohang and hamada are somewhat overestimated due to the overestimation the rmses of eq 3 at these stations are larger than those of t s 1 14 t m 02 leading to lower indices of agreement see table 3 however the pearson s correlation coefficients of eq 3 at these sites are larger than those of t s 1 14 t m 02 because of the smaller sis on the other hand the average value of rmses of eq 3 is 0 17 s smaller than that of t s 1 14 t m 02 the average value of si of eq 3 is also smaller than that of t s 1 14 t m 02 from this it can be concluded that the accuracy of computed significant wave periods in wave hindcasting has been improved by using eq 3 instead of t s 1 14 t m 02 meanwhile table 3 shows that the rmse and si of computed significant wave period in chun and ahn s 2017 wave hindcasting are 0 94 s and 0 16 respectively these quantities are about two and four times respectively larger than those in table 2 probably because the errors were from predicting significant wave period and the numerical computation here the uncertainty in the newly predicted significant wave period of chun and ahn s 2017 numerical model is 16 2 comparing it with the uncertainty in predicting significant wave period it can be seen that the uncertainty in the numerical model is 7 3 despite of the numerical errors the pearson s correlation coefficients and indices of agreement for significant wave period in the wave hindcasting model range 0 72 0 92 and 0 82 0 96 respectively the accuracy in the significant wave period predicted by the present formula is comparable to those of cherneva et al 2008 and pilar et al 2008 the pearson s correlation coefficients of cherneva et al s 2008 peak period and pilar et al s 2008 mean period were 0 55 0 88 and 0 69 0 88 respectively on 23 february 2008 high waves have hit the east coast of korea to claim several human lives at the gangneung port the high waves at the gangneung port were successfully reproduced by chun and ahn 2017 and lee et al 2010 meanwhile the waves also damaged the west coast of japan lee et al 2010 to further examine the accuracy of the present formula in a wave hindcasting model the predicted and measured waves at hamada and niigata are compared in figs 7 and 8 respectively the significant wave period calculated by t s 1 14 t m 02 is also presented fig 7 shows that chun and ahn s 2017 model successfully reproduces the storm waves at hamada the calculated maximum significant wave height is 5 35 m while the measured value is 5 39 m when the significant wave height reaches at its maximum the predicted and measured significant wave periods are 9 79 s and 9 5 s respectively indicating good agreement between them the predicted and measured significant wave periods show good agreement during the entire storm period except the decaying period of the storm when both significant wave height and period are slightly underestimated meanwhile the significant wave period calculated by t s 1 14 t m 02 is slightly overestimated during the entire storm period except the decaying period of the storm the calculated storm waves at niigata are also in good agreement with the measurement as shown in fig 8 even though the numerical results at the storm s peak were not validated due to the lack of measurements unlike at hamada both wave height and period are overestimated during the decaying period of the storm the significant wave period calculated by t s 1 14 t m 02 is again overestimated during the entire storm period 3 2 relationship between significant wave height and period in the jes when determining the design wave the wave height is estimated by the extreme wave analysis and the wave period is obtained from the relationship between the significant wave height and period goda 2003 suh et al 2010 it is common to obtain the relationship from extreme wave data such as annual maximum waves however the

these values are different from those in table 3 the index of agreement in fig 9 measures the agreement between the most probable significant wave period calculated by eq 4 and the measured significant wave period whereas the index of agreement in table 3 measures the agreement between the significant wave period calculated by eq 3 and the measured wave period the index of agreement is relatively small at koga s2 pohang and hupo where the effect of southerly swell waves is significant but it was not calculated accurately in the numerical model the coefficients Œ± and Œ≤ from the present analysis are presented in figure 10 and 11 respectively the coefficient Œ± ranges from 4 to 6 5 being relatively large along the east coast of korean peninsula and the west coast of japan with a little larger values along the japanese coast due to the northwesterly wind on the other hand the values are smaller than 5 along the south coast of korean peninsula because it is so close to the southern boundary of the numerical model that the waves were not developed enough meanwhile the coefficient Œ≤ in the jes ranges from 0 15 to 0 35 as shown in figure 11 the values of Œ≤ near the west coast of japan are somewhat larger than those near the east coast of korea again by the action of northwesterly wind furthermore the coefficients are relatively small near the boundary of the
