24725,migratory species do not necessarily behave migratory continuously an important aspect of studying migratory species is therefore to distinguish between movement and resident behavior telemetry is a rapidly evolving technique to study animal movement but the number of data processing techniques to account for resident behavior remains limited in this study we describe how models that were initially developed to predict human customer behavior i e two part and three part models provide new insights in the movement of migrating eel by accounting for resident behavior apparent from telemetry data sets in econometrics two part models take into account that the decision of a customer to purchase an item and the decision of the customer on the purchase quantity of the concerning product might be affected by different factors similarly the factors that affect the decision of a fish to migrate or to stay resident might be different from the factors that affect the swimming speed of the fish telemetry data of eel movement in the permanent belgian acoustic receiver network pbarn of the scheldt estuary was used this network with high detection probabilities allowed residencies to be recognized defined and introduced as zero values in a movement residency data set two part models which consider movement decision i e residency or movement and movement intensity i e swimming speed as two different processes or parts of one larger model outperformed one part models that do not make that distinction this underlines the complex migration behavior eels exhibit these two part models in turn were outperformed by three part models that also accounted for cryptic i e unobserved residencies while the one part model identified the tides and the distance from the most upstream gate as most important for movement the three part models identified the tides as most important for the movement decision and the distance from the most upstream gate as most important for the movement intensity considering movement decisions cryptic residencies and movement intensity in modeling efforts increased model performance by 9 8 underlining the importance of acknowledging the potentially complex behavior animals exhibit graphical abstract keywords acoustic telemetry fish movement residency gate two part and three part model eel migration data accessibility the r code subset of data and documentation are available om mendeley data http dx doi org 10 17632 vtrxw2m9wp 1 1 introduction zero values are often encountered in ecological count data where they typically represent absences however zeros may have different meanings as they may arise from real absences due to habitat unsuitability or from false absences due to observer and design errors blasco moreno et al 2019 similarly in telemetry studies data sets can be heavily zero inflated if moments of non detection are considered as zeros brownscombe et al 2019 whoriskey et al 2019 with the meaningfulness of these zeros being strongly dependent on the network design bruneel et al 2020 since the objective of many telemetry studies is to describe movement behavior of animals zero values could be used as an indication of non movement or residency however accounting for resident behavior represented as zero values in telemetry data might require adapted models therefore the aim of this study is to evaluate currently used models and to assess the potential of alternative models to deal with such data a good network design is key to defining zero values in estuarine and riverine acoustic networks with good detection probabilities receivers may act as gates that tagged animals need to pass to leave a specific area kraus et al 2018 steckenreuter et al 2017 therefore animals which remain undetected could still be positioned within a zone of the study area i e between two gates allowing periods of non detection to be considered as residencies between detections bruneel et al 2020 however the specific animal behavior between detections often remains entirely unknown unless some expert knowledge such as typical swimming speed and spawning period is integrated for example a fish known to migrate during a certain period would be expected to perform highly unidirectional movement behavior and unexpected travel delays would be an indirect indication of resident behavior between detections since these residencies between detections cannot be observed directly they are referred to as cryptic residencies zero inflated data sets often require adapted statistical tools depending on the nature of zeros different statistical ecological models have been suggested if both false and true zeros are likely to be present zero inflated models are typically used while hurdle models are used when there are only true zeros zuur et al 2009 more specifically hurdle models assume that two processes result in two distinct signals i e zero versus not zero while zero inflated models assume that both processes can yield zero values for example in case detection probabilities are low individual fish not being detected might actually be present yielding false zeros in addition to structural zeros in such a case zero inflated models would be most appropriate within the field of ecology zero inflated and hurdle models are typically used for modeling count data inflated with observed absences blasco moreno et al 2019 joseph et al 2009 zuur et al 2009 although continuous and proportional ecological data sets are omnipresent model equivalents for these types of data are not often used however for continuous ecological data such as fish swimming speed models with a similar approach but different underlying distribution could be useful i e while for count data poisson or negative binomial distributions are typically used gaussian or gamma distributions would be more appropriate for continuous data in econometric studies for example the continuous equivalents of hurdle models known as two part models have already been used frequently deb and holmes 2002 farewell et al 2017 excess zeros are often considered a nuisance as they typically require more complex models with more parameters to be defined warton 2005 however explicitly accounting for zero values may be useful as they may represent a unique signal of an unconsidered process for example in econometrics two part models have been widely used to study customer behavior neelon et al 2016 pohlmeier and ulrich 1995 a customer might decide to purchase a product will i buy this but after that decision he she would also need to decide on the quantity of the product how much of it will i buy the conditions that drive the customer to purchase may be different from those driving the level of consumption hence accounting for each process separately may be necessary to understand customer behavior similarly the factors that trigger fish movement i e the movement decision may be different from the factors determining the distance or speed with which the fish moves i e the movement intensity hence accounting for movement decision and intensity separately may also be necessary to understand fish movement behavior therefore the aim of this study was to assess the added value for predictions and the implications for ecological knowledge of distinguishing between both processes of fish movement behavior more specifically we compared the predictive performance and inferred ecological knowledge of one part and two part models describing the movement behavior of migrating eel anguilla anguilla l in the scheldt estuary in addition to assess whether a further compartmentalization e g distinction between upstream and downstream movement would provide added value different three part models were constructed and compared with the one part and two part models given the increasing data availability and complexity entailed by the exponential increase of possible associations among predictors machine learning is gaining ground among movement ecologists because of its high predictive performance and alleged ease of use joseph et al 2017 wang 2019 however although machine learning is built on a statistical framework the outputs of pattern learning algorithms are often difficult to interpret in the wider context of system functioning bzdok et al 2018 therefore in practice the choice between machine learning and statistical models is typically determined by the purpose which is either to make predictions or to infer knowledge respectively however since ecologists typically want the best of both worlds i e a model that is interpretable in terms of ecological knowledge while remaining broadly applicable for predictions statistical models and machine learning should be treated as complementary tools therefore we also compared the interpretability and the predictive performance of statistical models i e one part and two part regression models hybrid models i e three part models that combine neural networks with generalized linear regression and machine learning algorithms i e conditional inference random forests rf for the current telemetry data set 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the schelde estuary is a well mixed estuary of 160 km long without transversal man made migration barriers and characterized by strong currents high turbidity and a large tidal amplitude up to 6 m cornet et al 2016 the estuary can be divided in two regions upstream to downstream the zeeschelde which spans 105 km from ghent to antwerp belgium and the westerschelde which covers the 55 km from antwerp to the mouth of the estuary at vlissingen the netherlands the width of the zeeschelde varies between 50 to 1350 m while the width of the westerschelde varies between 2000 and 8000 m fig 1 the description of the study area was adopted from 10 this study was limited to the part of the zeeschelde because of the relatively low detection probability of the gates in the westerschelde see section 2 3 2 2 tagging procedure at the tidal weir in merelbeke ghent 100 eels were caught and internally tagged with v13 vemco ltd canada coded acoustic transmitters verhelst et al 2018 after capture surgery and recovery thorstad et al 2013 fish were released at the nearest receiver of the 100 tagged eels 58 migrated the migration period of these 58 eels was determined verhelst et al 2018 and used for further analysis a more detailed description of the tagging procedure is provided in appendix a the description of the tagging procedure was adopted from 10 2 3 acoustic network within the framework of the belgian lifewatch observatory a permanent longitudinal network of receivers vr2w vemco ltd canada has been deployed since the spring of 2014 in the schelde estuary reubens et al 2019b currently the network consists of 25 receivers deployed from the river bank which were combined into 18 gates that are on average 4969 m apart fig 1 and table b 1 at four locations s15 s16 s17 and s18 a receiver on each side of the estuary was deployed to cover the whole width the exact detection range for the different receivers in the zeeschelde was unknown but ranges between 300 m and 1000 m verhelst et al 2018 results from the network in the north sea suggest that it is strongly dependent on current velocity and wave action and will therefore be characterized by a strong spatial and temporal variability reubens et al 2019a the detection probability of the gates was estimated using the conditional nature of fish movement throughout the system brownscombe et al 2019 since there are no other pathways to the north sea tagged fish have to pass the different gates in a well defined order and detection probability can be defined as the probability of detecting a tag moving past a specific gate melnychuk 2012 perry et al 2012 the detection probabilities of the different gates are given in table b 1 the description of the acoustic network was adopted from 10 2 4 eel movement given the high average detection probability of 97 0 in the zeeschelde the number of false zeros was likely limited in addition since the movement of eels is highly unidirectional once they have started migrating eels not being detected at one gate are likely to be detected at the next gate causing some reduction in resolution but still providing a reliable position estimate since false zeros due to low detection probabilities are unlikely we decided to work with two part models instead of zero inflated models when a tagged eel was consecutively detected at two different gates we considered the time lapse between these two detections as a movement interval and the distance between the two gates was determined when a tagged eel was detected multiple times at a specific gate without being detected at any other gate the time lapse between the earliest and last detection was considered as a residency interval and was assigned a distance value of zero it should be noted that some short intervals might actually have been identified incorrectly as residency intervals for example a migrating eel might come within the detection range and have multiple detections while moving from one side of the gate to the other although considered as highly variable in literature breukelaar et al 2009 verbiest et al 2012 we assumed an average migration speed of 0 25 m s 1 and a detection range of 250 meter yielding an approximate threshold value of at least 30 min for residency intervals to ensure that movement was not wrongly identified as residencies this value was doubled and all residency intervals with a time span below 1 h were omitted from the analysis 10 80 of the residency intervals were retained for analysis it is possible that before heading to the next gate a tagged eel was resident between two gates without entering either gate s detection range such unobserved or cryptic residencies are not directly apparent from the data as they are observed as being part of the movement interval however these cryptic residencies can be accounted for indirectly as they will cause a travel delay in the movement interval negatively affecting the time necessary to reach the next gate recognizing resident behavior in acoustic telemetry networks based on position estimates alone often remains a difficult objective cagua et al 2015 in this specific study indirect i e through travel delays and direct indications of apparent non movement can be either the result of i fish choosing to be resident and to discontinue swimming or ii fish swimming against the currents without much net gain in distance covered however if there are clear signs of individual variation and enough individuals to account for it a distinction between both can be made when animals are resident they cannot be distinguished from each other using position estimates alone however when they migrate even against the current the fastest individuals will reach higher swimming speeds and can as such be distinguished from slower individuals it should be noted that throughout the manuscript swimming speed represents the ground speed i e geographical progress per unit of time without correction for current speed as each tag emits a signal at a unique frequency individuals can be identified and individual variation in swimming speed can be determined and used to analyze the behavior associated with apparent non movement since european eel and other migrating fish have been found to apply different strategies to save energy it is much more likely that eels would choose the most energy efficient option and choose to be resident when facing currents rather than to swim without much net gain in distance covered arnold and cook 1984 glebe and leggett 1981 metcalfe et al 1990 therefore we consider measurements of apparent non movement as residencies and evaluate afterwards whether this choice was justified based on the outcomes of the models to differentiate between upstream and downstream movement distances covered upstream were given a negative sign while distances covered downstream were given a positive sign to normalize the data distances were divided by time yielding swimming speed residency and movement intervals with a time lapse higher than one full tidal cycle were removed 13 42 data removal as they do not allow to contribute movement behavior to either ebb tide flood tide or a combination of both see section 2 5 to account for telemetry detection errors that might cause unrealistic swimming speeds movement intervals with a swimming speed of 1 5 interquartile ranges iqrs below the first quartile or above the third quartile were considered outliers and removed from the data set tukey 1977 in practice all movement intervals with a swimming speed higher than 2 7 or lower than 1 5 m s were omitted from the analysis additional 2 20 data removal in summary first 89 20 of residency intervals were removed followed by a 13 42 removal from the entire data set movement intervals residency intervals followed by a 2 20 removal from the entire data set the final data set contained 19 24 and 80 76 residency and movement intervals respectively 2 5 environmental data as the biological response in this study was analyzed at a relatively fine spatiotemporal resolution bultel et al 2014 verhelst et al 2018 a sound coupling of biological and environmental data would have been challenging and use of daily averages would have yielded inconclusive results on within day movement patterns therefore only variables were included that were fixed in time i e distance from source fixed in space i e day phase known to be accurate at high spatial and temporal resolutions i e period of flooding and period of ebbing or known to be well represented by daily averages i e moon and tidal phase it should be noted that the main aim of this study was to assess the potential of alternative ecological models rather than to identify all environmental factors affecting eel migration to obtain a more comprehensive understanding of these environmental factors more fine scale measurements and or simulations of potentially important environmental variables such as discharge temperature salinity and precipitation could be used to fine tune the developed models the following description of the collection and processing of tidal data was adapted from 46 to account for the distances between the locations of the gates and of the tidal measuring stations hydraulic information centre belgium a weighted average method was applied to estimate the precise moments of low and high water at the gates the closest upstream and downstream tidal measuring stations were assigned to each gate based on the distances between these tidal stations and the gate linear weights were assigned to both tidal stations when tidal data at the respective upstream or downstream tidal station was absent or of questionable quality e g outliers and known periods of malfunctioning measuring devices at the time interval of interest the next upstream or downstream tidal station was chosen this allowed us to estimate the duration of ebbing and flooding for each movement and residency interval the ratio of period flood tide minutes over total period of the interval minutes was determined and used as a predictor i e flood ratio per gate the ratio of the maximum difference in water level of the concerning day over the median of the maximum difference in water level per day of the entire study period was used as a proxy for tidal phase with low values being associated with neap tide and large values with spring tide moon phase was a numerical value representing the degree of illumination of the moon ranging from new moon 0 to full moon 1 time of day was a categorical variable with the classes day night dusk and dawn distance from source gave the distance km from the most upstream gate to the detecting gate 2 6 model construction and evaluation all analyses were performed using the r software r core team 2019 to construct the different models the stats r core team 2019 nnet venables and ripley 2002 and ranger wright and ziegler 2014 packages were used 2 6 1 model construction in the one part two part three part and random forest models swimming speed was used as response variable while flood ratio tidal phase moon phase day phase and distance from source were evaluated as potential predictors linear weights were introduced in model construction and evaluation to account for the different numbers of observations between eels the weights of the observations were determined for each eel independently as 1 n k with n k the number of observations of eel k hence for each eel the sum of the weights was one as a consequence each eel contributed equally to the constructed models in the one part two part and three part models these weights were used to determine weighted likelihoods in the random forests these weights represented the probability with which observations were selected in the bootstrap first a one part model was constructed for the entire data set which consisted of a multiple linear regression model with gaussian distribution second continuous two part models were constructed which consisted of two sub models adapted from belotti et al 2015 1 a binomial model for the entire data set with movement and residency as contrasts 1 p r y 0 x f x t α where y is the response variable x is a vector of predictors x 1 x 1 x k with k the number of predictors α is the corresponding vector of parameters to be estimated α α 0 α 1 α k with k the number of parameters and f is the cumulative distribution function of an independent and identically distributed error term from a probit model 2 a multiple linear model with gaussian distribution solely for the movement data 2 θ y y 0 x h x t β where θ is the probability density function β is the corresponding vector of parameters to be estimated and h is a gaussian density function for y with expectation x t β and some constant variance σ 2 the likelihood contribution for an observation can be written as 3 θ y 1 f x t α i y 0 f x t α h x t β i y 0 where i denotes the binary indicator function then the log likelihood contribution is 4 ln θ y i y 0 ln 1 f x t α i y 0 ln f x t α ln h x t β because the α and β parameters are additively separable in the log likelihood contribution for each observation the models for the full data set and the non zeros can be estimated separately predictions of y i y i x i were obtained by multiplying the predictions from each part of the model for the corresponding observations 5 y i x i p i x i y i y i 0 x i where p i x i is the predicted probability that y i 0 to obtain the most parsimonious model each part of the model was constructed using a step wise approach with aic as selection criteria 6 aic 2 ln l 2 k where l is the maximum value of the likelihood function and k the number of estimated parameters by definition two part models assume that both parts of the model are independent however this should not always necessarily be the case therefore the added value of accounting for any dependence between both parts was also assessed this type of model is referred to as a selection model in literature and can be constructed using a two stage estimation procedure 1 the inverse mills ratio imr is determined from the binomial model for the full data set and 2 the linear regression model for the movement data is constructed with imr as additional covariate heckman 1979 the imr is 7 imr x ϕ x φ x with ϕ the standard normal density φ the standard normal cumulative distribution function and x the vector of linear predictors of the binomial model to assess whether further distinction between upstream and downstream movement would improve the predictions a three part model was constructed this model consisted of 1 a multinomial model via neural networks with three contrasts residency upstream movement and downstream movement 2 a linear model of the upstream movement and 3 a linear model of the downstream movement one could argue that the few upstream intervals 3 7 of the total amount of intervals per eel actually represented residency intervals gone wrong i e eel trying to stay resident are in fact slightly pushed back upstream see also section 3 1 therefore additional one part and two part models were constructed after transformation of the few upstream movement intervals into residency intervals i e they were given a value 0 additionally a three part model was constructed as an attempt to account for the bimodal pattern of the non zero data see section 3 1 the three parts in this model were 0 vs 0 to threshold vs threshold to 2 7 ms 1 after assessing the predictive performance of models with different thresholds threshold interval selection based on inspection of stacked density plots in section 3 1 from 0 3 to 0 7 with a step size of 0 01 and 104 monte carlo cross validations the threshold that yielded the model with the highest predictive performance was retained threshold 0 45 m s 1 see section 3 2 finally conditional inference random forests were used to analyze both data sets i e with and without upstream movement intervals different parameter settings were assessed but since default parameters gave slightly higher performances only these results were reported 2 6 2 model performance to assess the performance of the models monte carlocross validations were performed with 106 repeats during which some individuals were used for training and some for testing different ratios 2 3 3 4 4 5 5 6 6 7 7 8 8 9 and 9 10 for training were assessed but since very similar results were obtained within each model e g 0 1 difference in root mean square error rmse only results for a ratio of 9 10 1 10 for training testing were reported per repeat a step wise approach with aic as selection criterion was used to arrive at the most parsimonious model per repeat the rmse was calculated as given in eq 8 with m the number of eels in the test data set n k the number of observations of eel k y j the actual value and y j x j the predicted value of the swimming speed finally the average rmse over all repeats was determined 8 r m s e 1 m k 1 m 1 n k j 1 n k y j y j x j 2 2 6 3 model validation to quantify the uncertainty of the parameter estimates bootstrap confidence intervals were determined while standard parametric inferences rely on a priori assumptions of the underlying distribution of the population the non parametric resampling approach of bootstrapping provides an estimate of the statistic s sampling distribution using within sample variation more specifically by considering the sample distribution as representative for the population distribution bootstrapping can be used to estimate the quality of the predictive model first to develop the most parsimonious models model selection was performed using the procedure described by 2 based on bootstrap samples backwards elimination and aic n 104 second the coefficient estimates of the retained variables and their 95 bootstrap percentile confidence intervals were determined n 104 davison and hinkley 1997 linear bootstrap sampling weights were used to account for the different number of observations between eels 2 6 4 extension to one part and two part mixed models one major advantage of telemetry is its ability to provide data on the level of individuals and therefore mixed models that account for individual correlation are commonly used therefore we also compared the explanatory power of one part mixed models and two part mixed models both models had eel id as random intercept the rmse values were used as proxies of explanatory power since in the two part models independence between parts is assumed we did not account for any correlation across both fixed effects and random effects from the different parts of the two part model i e the random effects of the binomial model and those of the linear model were determined independently 3 results 3 1 exploratory analysis an exploratory analysis of the data suggests that downstream movement intervals generally took place during ebb tide figs 2 and c 1 the normalized duration of flood tide in the downstream movement intervals was either 0 or to a lesser extent 100 fig 2 suggesting that downstream movement intervals contained either no flooding at all or a full flood cycle on the other hand upstream movement intervals typically took place during flood tide figs 2 and c 1 finally residencies seemed to occur more often during flood tide than during ebb tide fig 2 transformed stacked density plots of swimming speed gave additional insights into the distribution of the data fig 3 it is clear from these figures that the bimodal pattern in the non zero data is the result of different tidal conditions rather than of individual differences most eels have swimming speeds ranging from 0 to 2 m s 1 but swimming speeds from 0 to approximately 0 45 m s 1 typically occurred during pure flooding or a combination of flooding and ebbing while swimming speeds of approximately 0 45 to 2 m s 1 typically occurred during pure ebbing events this suggests that movement intervals with a swimming speed below approximately 0 45 m s 1 are likely to contain cryptic residencies causing a delay in travel time 3 2 model construction and evaluation for the original data set monte carlo cross validations indicated that the three part model which compartmentalized predictions into 1 residencies and 2 downstream and 3 upstream movement had the highest predictive performance rmse 0 4055 followed by the two part model rmse 0 4073 which compartmentalized predictions in 1 residencies and 2 movement the selection model rmse 0 4132 and the one part model rmse 0 4165 table 1 and fig 4 after transformation of the upstream movement intervals to residency intervals monte carlo cross validations indicated that the three part model which compartmentalized predictions into classes of 1 0 2 0 to 0 45 and 3 0 45 to 2 7 m s 1 had the highest predictive performance rmse 0 3653 followed by the two part model rmse 0 3804 which compartmentalized predictions into 1 residencies and 2 movement one part model rmse 0 4051 and selection model rmse 0 5410 table 1 since the three part model performed best it was retained for further analysis table 2 the results of the multinomial model of the three part model indicated that the distinction between 0 45 and 0 45 m s 1 was significantly better than the distinction between 0 and 0 to 0 45 m s 1 the relative risk ratio for a one percentage increase in the flood ratio was 0 987 for being between 0 and 0 45 m s 1 versus 0 m s 1 and 0 907 for being between 0 45 and 2 7 m s 1 versus 0 m s 1 the higher the flood ratio the higher the probability of an observed residency interval 0 m s 1 and the lower the probability of a movement interval with a swimming speed above 0 45 m s 1 the probability of a movement interval with a swimming speed below 0 45 m s 1 shows an increasing trend with flood ratio similar to the probability of residency intervals until a flood ratio of approximately 40 after which the probability decreases fig 5 however distinction between swimming speeds of 0 and 0 to 0 45 m s 1 was necessary in order to fit a generalized linear model with gamma distribution through the data using a binomial model with contrasts 0 45 and 0 45 m s 1 followed by two linear models yielded a lower predictive performance rmse 0 3712 and would have violated model assumptions the multinomial model on its own provided a relatively low predictive performance rmse 0 3940 but addition of a generalized linear model with gamma distribution from 0 to 0 45 m s 1 and a linear model from 0 45 to 2 7 m s 1 increased the predictive performance with 7 3 rmse 0 3653 the gamma model from 0 to 0 45 m s 1 indicated a significant negative effect of flood ratio however it should be noted that the model fit was relatively poor as using a null model instead decreased the overall predictive performance with only 1 1 rmse 0 3693 more benefit was gained from the linear model for the part of 0 45 to 2 7 m s 1 as its omission reduced overall predictive performance with 6 7 rmse 0 3898 the flood ratio and moon phase had a significantly negative and positive effect on the swimming speed respectively but were found to be far less important than the significant positive effect of the distance to source during ebbing tide eels closer to the north sea had relatively higher swimming speeds finally all full model parts of this three part model were offered the variable eel id as fixed factor in the model selection process but it was only retained in the latter linear model from 0 45 to 2 7 m s 1 this suggests that individual differences were important to predict swimming speeds from 0 45 to 2 7 m s 1 but not to distinguish between classes 1 0 2 0 to 0 45 and 3 0 45 to 2 7 m s 1 or to predict the swimming speed from 0 to 0 45 m s 1 similar predictors with reliable parameter estimates were retained in the different models table 2 for the binomial part of the two part models only flood ratio was retained while the one part models and linear parts of the two part models retained in order of decreasing importance the factors flood ratio distance to source and moon phase the variable importance provided by the conditional inference random forests indicated that flood ratio 0 3733 was most important followed by distance from source 0 0609 moon phase 0 0218 tidal phase 0 0204 and day phase 0 00796 the conditional inference random forests performed better 2 8 than the best statistical model when considering upstream movement intervals but performed slightly worse 0 4 than the best statistical model when upstream movement intervals were not considered rmse values of the one part and two part mixed models for the data set without upstream movement intervals were 0 373 and 0 347 respectively hence the two part mixed model explained patterns in the data 7 0 better than the one part mixed model 4 discussion 4 1 evaluating one part two part and three part mixed models movement decisions have been assessed in depth for a wide range of animals berdahl et al 2017 dechmann et al 2017 o neal et al 2018 but the number of studies combining movement decisions with movement intensity e g swimming speed or distance covered has been limited brodersen et al 2008 because zero values describe a unique behavioral aspect in movement behavior i e residencies defining observed zeros and identifying cryptic zeros in telemetry data sets allowed to improve predictive performance and to obtain more detailed ecological insights the predictive performances of the original three part and two part models were higher between 2 2 and 9 8 than those of the one part models suggesting that the conditions that affect the movement decision are not necessarily the same as the conditions that affect the movement intensity taking into consideration that both processes might be correlated did not improve predictions as the selection models had a lower predictive performance this is in concordance with many econometric studies in which accounting for potential dependencies between both parts of the model did not seem to add to the quality of the predictions madden 2008 smith 2003 although distinguishing between movement and residencies provided clearly better predictions further distinction between upstream and downstream movement only provided marginally better predictive performances 0 4 this might be because of the limited amount of upstream movement intervals and the limited amount of individuals exhibiting upstream movement causing only a limited increase in explanatory power in the test set however the poor gain in explanatory power of the model may also be the result of the similar conditions in which upstream movement and residencies occurred indeed considering upstream movement as residencies gone wrong resulted in a 6 6 and 2 7 increase in performance for the two part and one part model respectively this suggests that some eels are unsuccessful in remaining resident during flooding as they are pushed back or that they mistake flooding for ebbing when moving along with the current a final improvement of model performance was apparent from further compartmentalization distinction between swimming speeds of 1 0 2 0 to 0 45 and 3 0 45 to 2 7 m s 1 caused predictions of swimming speed to be 9 8 better this model improvement was mainly the result of the contrasting tidal conditions before and after 0 45 m s 1 with eels facing or not facing a flooding event respectively hence compartmentalization was successful because it adequately classified observed residencies 0 m s 1 cryptic residencies 0 to 0 45 m s 1 and movement intervals 0 45 to 2 7 m s 1 the results of the three part model suggest that the movement decision depends only on the tides while the swimming speed is dependent on the tides and the distance from source the larger the contribution of flooding the more likely a specific time lapse will be a residency interval rather than a movement interval in addition eels which migrated during ebb tide and which were already close to the sea typically had the highest swimming speed the conditions during which the movement intervals of the first peak of the bimodal pattern 0 45 m s 1 occurred were actually more closely related to those of residency intervals than those of movement intervals of the second peak of the bimodal pattern 0 45 m s 1 within the observed movement intervals characterized by a swimming speed below 0 45 m s 1 cryptic or undetected residencies were invoked by flooding events during these flooding events eels had to interrupt their journey causing lower observed swimming speeds for swimming speeds above 0 45 m s 1 the distance to the north sea seemed to play a more important role than the tides in addition individual variation was significantly more important for swimming speeds above than below 0 45 m s 1 and also the movement decision did not show any significant individual variation this suggests that all eels stay resident during flood but also that some eels swim faster or slower than others once the decision to continue their migration has been made the simple position estimates of a single individual would have made it difficult to classify apparent non movement as either i residencies or ii movement without net gain in distance covered however the ability to quantify individual variation from a large number of tagged individuals provided evidence in favor of the first option more specifically as there were clearly faster and slower swimming individuals the second option would have resulted in meaningful differences between individuals across all parts of the model i e some individuals would be pushed back while others would advance during flood this was however not the case one major advantage of telemetry is its ability to provide data on the level of individuals and therefore mixed models that account for individual correlation are commonly used gillies et al 2006 hooten et al 2017 two part and three part models can be easily extended to include mixed effects in order to provide a higher explanatory power in this study the explanatory power of mixed two part models was 7 0 higher than their one part equivalents however it should be noted that potential dependencies between the elements of random and fixed factors across the different parts were not considered if correlation between the random effects across the different parts is expected a joint maximization of the likelihood functions would be required more research is needed to evaluate the added value of such an approach as its importance is likely to be case specific eels have already been shown to exhibit selective tidal stream transport stst as they make use of the tides to reach their destination with as little energy expenditure as possible barry et al 2016 verhelst et al 2018 however by comparing one part with two part and three part models we illustrated that migrating fish exhibit complex behavior and that models initially constructed to assess human customer behavior might also be of use to study other animals farewell et al 2017 4 2 statistical models versus machine learning statistical models are generally preferred over machine learning when the number of available predictors is limited and the main purpose is to infer ecological knowledge while the contrary is true if predictive performance is deemed more important than inference since researchers often seek to optimize both knowledge and predictions a mutually exclusive approach should be avoided in this study we started off with a simple linear regression i e one part model then moved further to a two part model which combined a binomial regression with linear regression and finally ended up with a three part model which combined a multinomial model via neural networks i e machine learning generalized linear regression with gamma distribution and linear regression because each step of the model improvement was supported by ecological knowledge i e being aware that the conditions that cause eels to reside or to move might be different and methodological considerations i e residencies taking place between gates are not directly observed but do cause a travel delay the final three part model remained interpretable the conditional inference random forests provided similar results though less informative and had only slightly higher or lower predictive performances than the developed three part models hence appreciating the potential complexity of animal behavior and awareness towards the statistical framework that machine learning algorithms are built upon will provide researchers with the best machine learning has to offer without compromising the lessons learnt from statistical models 4 3 recommendations for future studies in order for zero values to provide useful information a good understanding of the meaning of zeros in the data is required in this study we considered all observed zeros to be true zeros which is a plausible assumption given the high detection probability of the network and mainly unidirectional movement of migrating eel in contrast in case detection probabilities are low many zero values might actually be false zeros as the result of important design and or observer errors and hence the probability of a false zero should be explicitly integrated in the model since the detection probability is affected by the network design transmission intervals and detection range which in turn is affected by environmental conditions reubens et al 2019a an elaborate addition to the two part models may be required to deal with high levels of false zeros in addition a good understanding of the detection range variability is also necessary to estimate any difference between the observed and actual biological response for instance in this study the observed swimming speed of eel likely differed from the actual swimming speed because of the unaccounted detection range variability furthermore the factors known to affect the detection range i e tides mathies et al 2014 also seem to be affecting the movement behavior of eel introducing not only noise but even a potential bias in the data independent range tests at different locations along the estuary and at different moments within the tidal cycle are a necessary addition to quantify the noise and or bias associated with detection range variability kessel et al 2014 it should also be noted that some limitations are inherent to the applied technique of passive telemetry and can only be resolved by additional data collection for example when eels are between gates and there seem to be travel delays during flooding apparent from reduced swimming speed it is difficult to tell whether eels i remained stationary near the bottom to preserve energy or ii swam against the currents without much gain in distance covered although the constructed models indicated that the first option is much more likely than the second depth profiles and actual swimming speed measurements obtained through archival tags with depth sensors and accelerometers would provide more direct estimates of specific animal behavior and would allow to validate the results of this study 5 conclusion in this study we illustrated how accounting for both well defined and cryptic residencies provides a better insight into the movement behavior of migrating eel two part and three part models turned out to be promising tools to deal with zero inflated telemetry data underlining the complex behavior of migrating fish nevertheless a sound assessment of the detection range variability in combination with more fine scale measurements of environmental variables is necessary in order to confirm the observed patterns in eel movement and its relationship with environmental variables although only data from one species one telemetry network and one telemetry technique was used the proposed model framework can be used for study cases with other species networks and techniques e g passive integrated transponder and radio telemetry credit authorship contribution statement

during late summer and autumn september november of three consecutive years 2015 till 2017 using double fyke nets after periods of heavy rain water flows over the sluices allowing eels to swim over the sluices placing the fyke nets behind the sluices and during periods of heavy rain allowed to coordinate capture events and improve the chance of capturing eel several morphometric features were measured in order to determine the eel maturation stage durif et al 2005 total length tl to the nearest mm body weight w to the nearest g the vertical and horizontal eye diameter edv and edh respectively to the nearest 0 01 mm and the length of the pectoral fin fl to the nearest 0 01 mm table a 1 only females were tagged since males are smaller than the minimum size handled in this study

24725,migratory species do not necessarily behave migratory continuously an important aspect of studying migratory species is therefore to distinguish between movement and resident behavior telemetry is a rapidly evolving technique to study animal movement but the number of data processing techniques to account for resident behavior remains limited in this study we describe how models that were initially developed to predict human customer behavior i e two part and three part models provide new insights in the movement of migrating eel by accounting for resident behavior apparent from telemetry data sets in econometrics two part models take into account that the decision of a customer to purchase an item and the decision of the customer on the purchase quantity of the concerning product might be affected by different factors similarly the factors that affect the decision of a fish to migrate or to stay resident might be different from the factors that affect the swimming speed of the fish telemetry data of eel movement in the permanent belgian acoustic receiver network pbarn of the scheldt estuary was used this network with high detection probabilities allowed residencies to be recognized defined and introduced as zero values in a movement residency data set two part models which consider movement decision i e residency or movement and movement intensity i e swimming speed as two different processes or parts of one larger model outperformed one part models that do not make that distinction this underlines the complex migration behavior eels exhibit these two part models in turn were outperformed by three part models that also accounted for cryptic i e unobserved residencies while the one part model identified the tides and the distance from the most upstream gate as most important for movement the three part models identified the tides as most important for the movement decision and the distance from the most upstream gate as most important for the movement intensity considering movement decisions cryptic residencies and movement intensity in modeling efforts increased model performance by 9 8 underlining the importance of acknowledging the potentially complex behavior animals exhibit graphical abstract keywords acoustic telemetry fish movement residency gate two part and three part model eel migration data accessibility the r code subset of data and documentation are available om mendeley data http dx doi org 10 17632 vtrxw2m9wp 1 1 introduction zero values are often encountered in ecological count data where they typically represent absences however zeros may have different meanings as they may arise from real absences due to habitat unsuitability or from false absences due to observer and design errors blasco moreno et al 2019 similarly in telemetry studies data sets can be heavily zero inflated if moments of non detection are considered as zeros brownscombe et al 2019 whoriskey et al 2019 with the meaningfulness of these zeros being strongly dependent on the network design bruneel et al 2020 since the objective of many telemetry studies is to describe movement behavior of animals zero values could be used as an indication of non movement or residency however accounting for resident behavior represented as zero values in telemetry data might require adapted models therefore the aim of this study is to evaluate currently used models and to assess the potential of alternative models to deal with such data a good network design is key to defining zero values in estuarine and riverine acoustic networks with good detection probabilities receivers may act as gates that tagged animals need to pass to leave a specific area kraus et al 2018 steckenreuter et al 2017 therefore animals which remain undetected could still be positioned within a zone of the study area i e between two gates allowing periods of non detection to be considered as residencies between detections bruneel et al 2020 however the specific animal behavior between detections often remains entirely unknown unless some expert knowledge such as typical swimming speed and spawning period is integrated for example a fish known to migrate during a certain period would be expected to perform highly unidirectional movement behavior and unexpected travel delays would be an indirect indication of resident behavior between detections since these residencies between detections cannot be observed directly they are referred to as cryptic residencies zero inflated data sets often require adapted statistical tools depending on the nature of zeros different statistical ecological models have been suggested if both false and true zeros are likely to be present zero inflated models are typically used while hurdle models are used when there are only true zeros zuur et al 2009 more specifically hurdle models assume that two processes result in two distinct signals i e zero versus not zero while zero inflated models assume that both processes can yield zero values for example in case detection probabilities are low individual fish not being detected might actually be present yielding false zeros in addition to structural zeros in such a case zero inflated models would be most appropriate within the field of ecology zero inflated and hurdle models are typically used for modeling count data inflated with observed absences blasco moreno et al 2019 joseph et al 2009 zuur et al 2009 although continuous and proportional ecological data sets are omnipresent model equivalents for these types of data are not often used however for continuous ecological data such as fish swimming speed models with a similar approach but different underlying distribution could be useful i e while for count data poisson or negative binomial distributions are typically used gaussian or gamma distributions would be more appropriate for continuous data in econometric studies for example the continuous equivalents of hurdle models known as two part models have already been used frequently deb and holmes 2002 farewell et al 2017 excess zeros are often considered a nuisance as they typically require more complex models with more parameters to be defined warton 2005 however explicitly accounting for zero values may be useful as they may represent a unique signal of an unconsidered process for example in econometrics two part models have been widely used to study customer behavior neelon et al 2016 pohlmeier and ulrich 1995 a customer might decide to purchase a product will i buy this but after that decision he she would also need to decide on the quantity of the product how much of it will i buy the conditions that drive the customer to purchase may be different from those driving the level of consumption hence accounting for each process separately may be necessary to understand customer behavior similarly the factors that trigger fish movement i e the movement decision may be different from the factors determining the distance or speed with which the fish moves i e the movement intensity hence accounting for movement decision and intensity separately may also be necessary to understand fish movement behavior therefore the aim of this study was to assess the added value for predictions and the implications for ecological knowledge of distinguishing between both processes of fish movement behavior more specifically we compared the predictive performance and inferred ecological knowledge of one part and two part models describing the movement behavior of migrating eel anguilla anguilla l in the scheldt estuary in addition to assess whether a further compartmentalization e g distinction between upstream and downstream movement would provide added value different three part models were constructed and compared with the one part and two part models given the increasing data availability and complexity entailed by the exponential increase of possible associations among predictors machine learning is gaining ground among movement ecologists because of its high predictive performance and alleged ease of use joseph et al 2017 wang 2019 however although machine learning is built on a statistical framework the outputs of pattern learning algorithms are often difficult to interpret in the wider context of system functioning bzdok et al 2018 therefore in practice the choice between machine learning and statistical models is typically determined by the purpose which is either to make predictions or to infer knowledge respectively however since ecologists typically want the best of both worlds i e a model that is interpretable in terms of ecological knowledge while remaining broadly applicable for predictions statistical models and machine learning should be treated as complementary tools therefore we also compared the interpretability and the predictive performance of statistical models i e one part and two part regression models hybrid models i e three part models that combine neural networks with generalized linear regression and machine learning algorithms i e conditional inference random forests rf for the current telemetry data set 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the schelde estuary is a well mixed estuary of 160 km long without transversal man made migration barriers and characterized by strong currents high turbidity and a large tidal amplitude up to 6 m cornet et al 2016 the estuary can be divided in two regions upstream to downstream the zeeschelde which spans 105 km from ghent to antwerp belgium and the westerschelde which covers the 55 km from antwerp to the mouth of the estuary at vlissingen the netherlands the width of the zeeschelde varies between 50 to 1350 m while the width of the westerschelde varies between 2000 and 8000 m fig 1 the description of the study area was adopted from 10 this study was limited to the part of the zeeschelde because of the relatively low detection probability of the gates in the westerschelde see section 2 3 2 2 tagging procedure at the tidal weir in merelbeke ghent 100 eels were caught and internally tagged with v13 vemco ltd canada coded acoustic transmitters verhelst et al 2018 after capture surgery and recovery thorstad et al 2013 fish were released at the nearest receiver of the 100 tagged eels 58 migrated the migration period of these 58 eels was determined verhelst et al 2018 and used for further analysis a more detailed description of the tagging procedure is provided in appendix a the description of the tagging procedure was adopted from 10 2 3 acoustic network within the framework of the belgian lifewatch observatory a permanent longitudinal network of receivers vr2w vemco ltd canada has been deployed since the spring of 2014 in the schelde estuary reubens et al 2019b currently the network consists of 25 receivers deployed from the river bank which were combined into 18 gates that are on average 4969 m apart fig 1 and table b 1 at four locations s15 s16 s17 and s18 a receiver on each side of the estuary was deployed to cover the whole width the exact detection range for the different receivers in the zeeschelde was unknown but ranges between 300 m and 1000 m verhelst et al 2018 results from the network in the north sea suggest that it is strongly dependent on current velocity and wave action and will therefore be characterized by a strong spatial and temporal variability reubens et al 2019a the detection probability of the gates was estimated using the conditional nature of fish movement throughout the system brownscombe et al 2019 since there are no other pathways to the north sea tagged fish have to pass the different gates in a well defined order and detection probability can be defined as the probability of detecting a tag moving past a specific gate melnychuk 2012 perry et al 2012 the detection probabilities of the different gates are given in table b 1 the description of the acoustic network was adopted from 10 2 4 eel movement given the high average detection probability of 97 0 in the zeeschelde the number of false zeros was likely limited in addition since the movement of eels is highly unidirectional once they have started migrating eels not being detected at one gate are likely to be detected at the next gate causing some reduction in resolution but still providing a reliable position estimate since false zeros due to low detection probabilities are unlikely we decided to work with two part models instead of zero inflated models when a tagged eel was consecutively detected at two different gates we considered the time lapse between these two detections as a movement interval and the distance between the two gates was determined when a tagged eel was detected multiple times at a specific gate without being detected at any other gate the time lapse between the earliest and last detection was considered as a residency interval and was assigned a distance value of zero it should be noted that some short intervals might actually have been identified incorrectly as residency intervals for example a migrating eel might come within the detection range and have multiple detections while moving from one side of the gate to the other although considered as highly variable in literature breukelaar et al 2009 verbiest et al 2012 we assumed an average migration speed of 0 25 m s 1 and a detection range of 250 meter yielding an approximate threshold value of at least 30 min for residency intervals to ensure that movement was not wrongly identified as residencies this value was doubled and all residency intervals with a time span below 1 h were omitted from the analysis 10 80 of the residency intervals were retained for analysis it is possible that before heading to the next gate a tagged eel was resident between two gates without entering either gate s detection range such unobserved or cryptic residencies are not directly apparent from the data as they are observed as being part of the movement interval however these cryptic residencies can be accounted for indirectly as they will cause a travel delay in the movement interval negatively affecting the time necessary to reach the next gate recognizing resident behavior in acoustic telemetry networks based on position estimates alone often remains a difficult objective cagua et al 2015 in this specific study indirect i e through travel delays and direct indications of apparent non movement can be either the result of i fish choosing to be resident and to discontinue swimming or ii fish swimming against the currents without much net gain in distance covered however if there are clear signs of individual variation and enough individuals to account for it a distinction between both can be made when animals are resident they cannot be distinguished from each other using position estimates alone however when they migrate even against the current the fastest individuals will reach higher swimming speeds and can as such be distinguished from slower individuals it should be noted that throughout the manuscript swimming speed represents the ground speed i e geographical progress per unit of time without correction for current speed as each tag emits a signal at a unique frequency individuals can be identified and individual variation in swimming speed can be determined and used to analyze the behavior associated with apparent non movement since european eel and other migrating fish have been found to apply different strategies to save energy it is much more likely that eels would choose the most energy efficient option and choose to be resident when facing currents rather than to swim without much net gain in distance covered arnold and cook 1984 glebe and leggett 1981 metcalfe et al 1990 therefore we consider measurements of apparent non movement as residencies and evaluate afterwards whether this choice was justified based on the outcomes of the models to differentiate between upstream and downstream movement distances covered upstream were given a negative sign while distances covered downstream were given a positive sign to normalize the data distances were divided by time yielding swimming speed residency and movement intervals with a time lapse higher than one full tidal cycle were removed 13 42 data removal as they do not allow to contribute movement behavior to either ebb tide flood tide or a combination of both see section 2 5 to account for telemetry detection errors that might cause unrealistic swimming speeds movement intervals with a swimming speed of 1 5 interquartile ranges iqrs below the first quartile or above the third quartile were considered outliers and removed from the data set tukey 1977 in practice all movement intervals with a swimming speed higher than 2 7 or lower than 1 5 m s were omitted from the analysis additional 2 20 data removal in summary first 89 20 of residency intervals were removed followed by a 13 42 removal from the entire data set movement intervals residency intervals followed by a 2 20 removal from the entire data set the final data set contained 19 24 and 80 76 residency and movement intervals respectively 2 5 environmental data as the biological response in this study was analyzed at a relatively fine spatiotemporal resolution bultel et al 2014 verhelst et al 2018 a sound coupling of biological and environmental data would have been challenging and use of daily averages would have yielded inconclusive results on within day movement patterns therefore only variables were included that were fixed in time i e distance from source fixed in space i e day phase known to be accurate at high spatial and temporal resolutions i e period of flooding and period of ebbing or known to be well represented by daily averages i e moon and tidal phase it should be noted that the main aim of this study was to assess the potential of alternative ecological models rather than to identify all environmental factors affecting eel migration to obtain a more comprehensive understanding of these environmental factors more fine scale measurements and or simulations of potentially important environmental variables such as discharge temperature salinity and precipitation could be used to fine tune the developed models the following description of the collection and processing of tidal data was adapted from 46 to account for the distances between the locations of the gates and of the tidal measuring stations hydraulic information centre belgium a weighted average method was applied to estimate the precise moments of low and high water at the gates the closest upstream and downstream tidal measuring stations were assigned to each gate based on the distances between these tidal stations and the gate linear weights were assigned to both tidal stations when tidal data at the respective upstream or downstream tidal station was absent or of questionable quality e g outliers and known periods of malfunctioning measuring devices at the time interval of interest the next upstream or downstream tidal station was chosen this allowed us to estimate the duration of ebbing and flooding for each movement and residency interval the ratio of period flood tide minutes over total period of the interval minutes was determined and used as a predictor i e flood ratio per gate the ratio of the maximum difference in water level of the concerning day over the median of the maximum difference in water level per day of the entire study period was used as a proxy for tidal phase with low values being associated with neap tide and large values with spring tide moon phase was a numerical value representing the degree of illumination of the moon ranging from new moon 0 to full moon 1 time of day was a categorical variable with the classes day night dusk and dawn distance from source gave the distance km from the most upstream gate to the detecting gate 2 6 model construction and evaluation all analyses were performed using the r software r core team 2019 to construct the different models the stats r core team 2019 nnet venables and ripley 2002 and ranger wright and ziegler 2014 packages were used 2 6 1 model construction in the one part two part three part and random forest models swimming speed was used as response variable while flood ratio tidal phase moon phase day phase and distance from source were evaluated as potential predictors linear weights were introduced in model construction and evaluation to account for the different numbers of observations between eels the weights of the observations were determined for each eel independently as 1 n k with n k the number of observations of eel k hence for each eel the sum of the weights was one as a consequence each eel contributed equally to the constructed models in the one part two part and three part models these weights were used to determine weighted likelihoods in the random forests these weights represented the probability with which observations were selected in the bootstrap first a one part model was constructed for the entire data set which consisted of a multiple linear regression model with gaussian distribution second continuous two part models were constructed which consisted of two sub models adapted from belotti et al 2015 1 a binomial model for the entire data set with movement and residency as contrasts 1 p r y 0 x f x t α where y is the response variable x is a vector of predictors x 1 x 1 x k with k the number of predictors α is the corresponding vector of parameters to be estimated α α 0 α 1 α k with k the number of parameters and f is the cumulative distribution function of an independent and identically distributed error term from a probit model 2 a multiple linear model with gaussian distribution solely for the movement data 2 θ y y 0 x h x t β where θ is the probability density function β is the corresponding vector of parameters to be estimated and h is a gaussian density function for y with expectation x t β and some constant variance σ 2 the likelihood contribution for an observation can be written as 3 θ y 1 f x t α i y 0 f x t α h x t β i y 0 where i denotes the binary indicator function then the log likelihood contribution is 4 ln θ y i y 0 ln 1 f x t α i y 0 ln f x t α ln h x t β because the α and β parameters are additively separable in the log likelihood contribution for each observation the models for the full data set and the non zeros can be estimated separately predictions of y i y i x i were obtained by multiplying the predictions from each part of the model for the corresponding observations 5 y i x i p i x i y i y i 0 x i where p i x i is the predicted probability that y i 0 to obtain the most parsimonious model each part of the model was constructed using a step wise approach with aic as selection criteria 6 aic 2 ln l 2 k where l is the maximum value of the likelihood function and k the number of estimated parameters by definition two part models assume that both parts of the model are independent however this should not always necessarily be the case therefore the added value of accounting for any dependence between both parts was also assessed this type of model is referred to as a selection model in literature and can be constructed using a two stage estimation procedure 1 the inverse mills ratio imr is determined from the binomial model for the full data set and 2 the linear regression model for the movement data is constructed with imr as additional covariate heckman 1979 the imr is 7 imr x ϕ x φ x with ϕ the standard normal density φ the standard normal cumulative distribution function and x the vector of linear predictors of the binomial model to assess whether further distinction between upstream and downstream movement would improve the predictions a three part model was constructed this model consisted of 1 a multinomial model via neural networks with three contrasts residency upstream movement and downstream movement 2 a linear model of the upstream movement and 3 a linear model of the downstream movement one could argue that the few upstream intervals 3 7 of the total amount of intervals per eel actually represented residency intervals gone wrong i e eel trying to stay resident are in fact slightly pushed back upstream see also section 3 1 therefore additional one part and two part models were constructed after transformation of the few upstream movement intervals into residency intervals i e they were given a value 0 additionally a three part model was constructed as an attempt to account for the bimodal pattern of the non zero data see section 3 1 the three parts in this model were 0 vs 0 to threshold vs threshold to 2 7 ms 1 after assessing the predictive performance of models with different thresholds threshold interval selection based on inspection of stacked density plots in section 3 1 from 0 3 to 0 7 with a step size of 0 01 and 104 monte carlo cross validations the threshold that yielded the model with the highest predictive performance was retained threshold 0 45 m s 1 see section 3 2 finally conditional inference random forests were used to analyze both data sets i e with and without upstream movement intervals different parameter settings were assessed but since default parameters gave slightly higher performances only these results were reported 2 6 2 model performance to assess the performance of the models monte carlocross validations were performed with 106 repeats during which some individuals were used for training and some for testing different ratios 2 3 3 4 4 5 5 6 6 7 7 8 8 9 and 9 10 for training were assessed but since very similar results were obtained within each model e g 0 1 difference in root mean square error rmse only results for a ratio of 9 10 1 10 for training testing were reported per repeat a step wise approach with aic as selection criterion was used to arrive at the most parsimonious model per repeat the rmse was calculated as given in eq 8 with m the number of eels in the test data set n k the number of observations of eel k y j the actual value and y j x j the predicted value of the swimming speed finally the average rmse over all repeats was determined 8 r m s e 1 m k 1 m 1 n k j 1 n k y j y j x j 2 2 6 3 model validation to quantify the uncertainty of the parameter estimates bootstrap confidence intervals were determined while standard parametric inferences rely on a priori assumptions of the underlying distribution of the population the non parametric resampling approach of bootstrapping provides an estimate of the statistic s sampling distribution using within sample variation more specifically by considering the sample distribution as representative for the population distribution bootstrapping can be used to estimate the quality of the predictive model first to develop the most parsimonious models model selection was performed using the procedure described by 2 based on bootstrap samples backwards elimination and aic n 104 second the coefficient estimates of the retained variables and their 95 bootstrap percentile confidence intervals were determined n 104 davison and hinkley 1997 linear bootstrap sampling weights were used to account for the different number of observations between eels 2 6 4 extension to one part and two part mixed models one major advantage of telemetry is its ability to provide data on the level of individuals and therefore mixed models that account for individual correlation are commonly used therefore we also compared the explanatory power of one part mixed models and two part mixed models both models had eel id as random intercept the rmse values were used as proxies of explanatory power since in the two part models independence between parts is assumed we did not account for any correlation across both fixed effects and random effects from the different parts of the two part model i e the random effects of the binomial model and those of the linear model were determined independently 3 results 3 1 exploratory analysis an exploratory analysis of the data suggests that downstream movement intervals generally took place during ebb tide figs 2 and c 1 the normalized duration of flood tide in the downstream movement intervals was either 0 or to a lesser extent 100 fig 2 suggesting that downstream movement intervals contained either no flooding at all or a full flood cycle on the other hand upstream movement intervals typically took place during flood tide figs 2 and c 1 finally residencies seemed to occur more often during flood tide than during ebb tide fig 2 transformed stacked density plots of swimming speed gave additional insights into the distribution of the data fig 3 it is clear from these figures that the bimodal pattern in the non zero data is the result of different tidal conditions rather than of individual differences most eels have swimming speeds ranging from 0 to 2 m s 1 but swimming speeds from 0 to approximately 0 45 m s 1 typically occurred during pure flooding or a combination of flooding and ebbing while swimming speeds of approximately 0 45 to 2 m s 1 typically occurred during pure ebbing events this suggests that movement intervals with a swimming speed below approximately 0 45 m s 1 are likely to contain cryptic residencies causing a delay in travel time 3 2 model construction and evaluation for the original data set monte carlo cross validations indicated that the three part model which compartmentalized predictions into 1 residencies and 2 downstream and 3 upstream movement had the highest predictive performance rmse 0 4055 followed by the two part model rmse 0 4073 which compartmentalized predictions in 1 residencies and 2 movement the selection model rmse 0 4132 and the one part model rmse 0 4165 table 1 and fig 4 after transformation of the upstream movement intervals to residency intervals monte carlo cross validations indicated that the three part model which compartmentalized predictions into classes of 1 0 2 0 to 0 45 and 3 0 45 to 2 7 m s 1 had the highest predictive performance rmse 0 3653 followed by the two part model rmse 0 3804 which compartmentalized predictions into 1 residencies and 2 movement one part model rmse 0 4051 and selection model rmse 0 5410 table 1 since the three part model performed best it was retained for further analysis table 2 the results of the multinomial model of the three part model indicated that the distinction between 0 45 and 0 45 m s 1 was significantly better than the distinction between 0 and 0 to 0 45 m s 1 the relative risk ratio for a one percentage increase in the flood ratio was 0 987 for being between 0 and 0 45 m s 1 versus 0 m s 1 and 0 907 for being between 0 45 and 2 7 m s 1 versus 0 m s 1 the higher the flood ratio the higher the probability of an observed residency interval 0 m s 1 and the lower the probability of a movement interval with a swimming speed above 0 45 m s 1 the probability of a movement interval with a swimming speed below 0 45 m s 1 shows an increasing trend with flood ratio similar to the probability of residency intervals until a flood ratio of approximately 40 after which the probability decreases fig 5 however distinction between swimming speeds of 0 and 0 to 0 45 m s 1 was necessary in order to fit a generalized linear model with gamma distribution through the data using a binomial model with contrasts 0 45 and 0 45 m s 1 followed by two linear models yielded a lower predictive performance rmse 0 3712 and would have violated model assumptions the multinomial model on its own provided a relatively low predictive performance rmse 0 3940 but addition of a generalized linear model with gamma distribution from 0 to 0 45 m s 1 and a linear model from 0 45 to 2 7 m s 1 increased the predictive performance with 7 3 rmse 0 3653 the gamma model from 0 to 0 45 m s 1 indicated a significant negative effect of flood ratio however it should be noted that the model fit was relatively poor as using a null model instead decreased the overall predictive performance with only 1 1 rmse 0 3693 more benefit was gained from the linear model for the part of 0 45 to 2 7 m s 1 as its omission reduced overall predictive performance with 6 7 rmse 0 3898 the flood ratio and moon phase had a significantly negative and positive effect on the swimming speed respectively but were found to be far less important than the significant positive effect of the distance to source during ebbing tide eels closer to the north sea had relatively higher swimming speeds finally all full model parts of this three part model were offered the variable eel id as fixed factor in the model selection process but it was only retained in the latter linear model from 0 45 to 2 7 m s 1 this suggests that individual differences were important to predict swimming speeds from 0 45 to 2 7 m s 1 but not to distinguish between classes 1 0 2 0 to 0 45 and 3 0 45 to 2 7 m s 1 or to predict the swimming speed from 0 to 0 45 m s 1 similar predictors with reliable parameter estimates were retained in the different models table 2 for the binomial part of the two part models only flood ratio was retained while the one part models and linear parts of the two part models retained in order of decreasing importance the factors flood ratio distance to source and moon phase the variable importance provided by the conditional inference random forests indicated that flood ratio 0 3733 was most important followed by distance from source 0 0609 moon phase 0 0218 tidal phase 0 0204 and day phase 0 00796 the conditional inference random forests performed better 2 8 than the best statistical model when considering upstream movement intervals but performed slightly worse 0 4 than the best statistical model when upstream movement intervals were not considered rmse values of the one part and two part mixed models for the data set without upstream movement intervals were 0 373 and 0 347 respectively hence the two part mixed model explained patterns in the data 7 0 better than the one part mixed model 4 discussion 4 1 evaluating one part two part and three part mixed models movement decisions have been assessed in depth for a wide range of animals berdahl et al 2017 dechmann et al 2017 o neal et al 2018 but the number of studies combining movement decisions with movement intensity e g swimming speed or distance covered has been limited brodersen et al 2008 because zero values describe a unique behavioral aspect in movement behavior i e residencies defining observed zeros and identifying cryptic zeros in telemetry data sets allowed to improve predictive performance and to obtain more detailed ecological insights the predictive performances of the original three part and two part models were higher between 2 2 and 9 8 than those of the one part models suggesting that the conditions that affect the movement decision are not necessarily the same as the conditions that affect the movement intensity taking into consideration that both processes might be correlated did not improve predictions as the selection models had a lower predictive performance this is in concordance with many econometric studies in which accounting for potential dependencies between both parts of the model did not seem to add to the quality of the predictions madden 2008 smith 2003 although distinguishing between movement and residencies provided clearly better predictions further distinction between upstream and downstream movement only provided marginally better predictive performances 0 4 this might be because of the limited amount of upstream movement intervals and the limited amount of individuals exhibiting upstream movement causing only a limited increase in explanatory power in the test set however the poor gain in explanatory power of the model may also be the result of the similar conditions in which upstream movement and residencies occurred indeed considering upstream movement as residencies gone wrong resulted in a 6 6 and 2 7 increase in performance for the two part and one part model respectively this suggests that some eels are unsuccessful in remaining resident during flooding as they are pushed back or that they mistake flooding for ebbing when moving along with the current a final improvement of model performance was apparent from further compartmentalization distinction between swimming speeds of 1 0 2 0 to 0 45 and 3 0 45 to 2 7 m s 1 caused predictions of swimming speed to be 9 8 better this model improvement was mainly the result of the contrasting tidal conditions before and after 0 45 m s 1 with eels facing or not facing a flooding event respectively hence compartmentalization was successful because it adequately classified observed residencies 0 m s 1 cryptic residencies 0 to 0 45 m s 1 and movement intervals 0 45 to 2 7 m s 1 the results of the three part model suggest that the movement decision depends only on the tides while the swimming speed is dependent on the tides and the distance from source the larger the contribution of flooding the more likely a specific time lapse will be a residency interval rather than a movement interval in addition eels which migrated during ebb tide and which were already close to the sea typically had the highest swimming speed the conditions during which the movement intervals of the first peak of the bimodal pattern 0 45 m s 1 occurred were actually more closely related to those of residency intervals than those of movement intervals of the second peak of the bimodal pattern 0 45 m s 1 within the observed movement intervals characterized by a swimming speed below 0 45 m s 1 cryptic or undetected residencies were invoked by flooding events during these flooding events eels had to interrupt their journey causing lower observed swimming speeds for swimming speeds above 0 45 m s 1 the distance to the north sea seemed to play a more important role than the tides in addition individual variation was significantly more important for swimming speeds above than below 0 45 m s 1 and also the movement decision did not show any significant individual variation this suggests that all eels stay resident during flood but also that some eels swim faster or slower than others once the decision to continue their migration has been made the simple position estimates of a single individual would have made it difficult to classify apparent non movement as either i residencies or ii movement without net gain in distance covered however the ability to quantify individual variation from a large number of tagged individuals provided evidence in favor of the first option more specifically as there were clearly faster and slower swimming individuals the second option would have resulted in meaningful differences between individuals across all parts of the model i e some individuals would be pushed back while others would advance during flood this was however not the case one major advantage of telemetry is its ability to provide data on the level of individuals and therefore mixed models that account for individual correlation are commonly used gillies et al 2006 hooten et al 2017 two part and three part models can be easily extended to include mixed effects in order to provide a higher explanatory power in this study the explanatory power of mixed two part models was 7 0 higher than their one part equivalents however it should be noted that potential dependencies between the elements of random and fixed factors across the different parts were not considered if correlation between the random effects across the different parts is expected a joint maximization of the likelihood functions would be required more research is needed to evaluate the added value of such an approach as its importance is likely to be case specific eels have already been shown to exhibit selective tidal stream transport stst as they make use of the tides to reach their destination with as little energy expenditure as possible barry et al 2016 verhelst et al 2018 however by comparing one part with two part and three part models we illustrated that migrating fish exhibit complex behavior and that models initially constructed to assess human customer behavior might also be of use to study other animals farewell et al 2017 4 2 statistical models versus machine learning statistical models are generally preferred over machine learning when the number of available predictors is limited and the main purpose is to infer ecological knowledge while the contrary is true if predictive performance is deemed more important than inference since researchers often seek to optimize both knowledge and predictions a mutually exclusive approach should be avoided in this study we started off with a simple linear regression i e one part model then moved further to a two part model which combined a binomial regression with linear regression and finally ended up with a three part model which combined a multinomial model via neural networks i e machine learning generalized linear regression with gamma distribution and linear regression because each step of the model improvement was supported by ecological knowledge i e being aware that the conditions that cause eels to reside or to move might be different and methodological considerations i e residencies taking place between gates are not directly observed but do cause a travel delay the final three part model remained interpretable the conditional inference random forests provided similar results though less informative and had only slightly higher or lower predictive performances than the developed three part models hence appreciating the potential complexity of animal behavior and awareness towards the statistical framework that machine learning algorithms are built upon will provide researchers with the best machine learning has to offer without compromising the lessons learnt from statistical models 4 3 recommendations for future studies in order for zero values to provide useful information a good understanding of the meaning of zeros in the data is required in this study we considered all observed zeros to be true zeros which is a plausible assumption given the high detection probability of the network and mainly unidirectional movement of migrating eel in contrast in case detection probabilities are low many zero values might actually be false zeros as the result of important design and or observer errors and hence the probability of a false zero should be explicitly integrated in the model since the detection probability is affected by the network design transmission intervals and detection range which in turn is affected by environmental conditions reubens et al 2019a an elaborate addition to the two part models may be required to deal with high levels of false zeros in addition a good understanding of the detection range variability is also necessary to estimate any difference between the observed and actual biological response for instance in this study the observed swimming speed of eel likely differed from the actual swimming speed because of the unaccounted detection range variability furthermore the factors known to affect the detection range i e tides mathies et al 2014 also seem to be affecting the movement behavior of eel introducing not only noise but even a potential bias in the data independent range tests at different locations along the estuary and at different moments within the tidal cycle are a necessary addition to quantify the noise and or bias associated with detection range variability kessel et al 2014 it should also be noted that some limitations are inherent to the applied technique of passive telemetry and can only be resolved by additional data collection for example when eels are between gates and there seem to be travel delays during flooding apparent from reduced swimming speed it is difficult to tell whether eels i remained stationary near the bottom to preserve energy or ii swam against the currents without much gain in distance covered although the constructed models indicated that the first option is much more likely than the second depth profiles and actual swimming speed measurements obtained through archival tags with depth sensors and accelerometers would provide more direct estimates of specific animal behavior and would allow to validate the results of this study 5 conclusion in this study we illustrated how accounting for both well defined and cryptic residencies provides a better insight into the movement behavior of migrating eel two part and three part models turned out to be promising tools to deal with zero inflated telemetry data underlining the complex behavior of migrating fish nevertheless a sound assessment of the detection range variability in combination with more fine scale measurements of environmental variables is necessary in order to confirm the observed patterns in eel movement and its relationship with environmental variables although only data from one species one telemetry network and one telemetry technique was used the proposed model framework can be used for study cases with other species networks and techniques e g passive integrated transponder and radio telemetry credit authorship contribution statement

24726,embedding nature based solutions nbs in cities is expected to bring quantifiable benefits including resilience to flooding drought and heatwaves and air quality improvement among nbs green roofs have an important role in temperature regulation in buildings and in lowering the damaging effects of heatwaves on human health in this paper a spatial microsimulation model is implemented to simulate temperature impacts of green roofs installations in cities and their capacity to attenuate the effects of heatwave episodes particularly vulnerable to heatwaves are elderly people with limited mobility who have limited means to seek cooling and create cooler indoor environments the model implemented using the netlogo platform version 6 0 4 considers as agents the elderly citizens in a city area and simulates the heatwave related health impacts which are measured in mortality likelihood in particular the model simulates a generalised 1 5 c to 3 c indoor temperature reduction range induced by green roofs based on inferences from green roof literature in four different european cities szeged hungary alcalá de henares spain metropolitan city of milan italy and çankaya municipality turkey the simulation utilises a ceteris paribus modelling approach meaning that the relationships of the observed phenomenon mortality induced by heatwaves with other possible influencing factors e g level of sport and physical activities practiced by people are not taken into account in the case of szeged alcalá de henares and çankaya municipality a substantial reduction in mortality is found to occur associated with green roofs roll out in the case of the metropolitan city of milan green roofs installations show a low mitigation effect in some scenarios the underlying factor is the temperature threshold parameter of the model above which heatwave mortality occurs this parameter was inferred from the literature baccini m et al 2008 and it resulted to be substantially higher in the metropolitan city of milan 31 8 c than in the other cities the simulation helps in obtaining results which are specific to a given city and particular scenarios therein and provides additional insights such as expected temperature mitigation effect induced by green roofs under climate change conditions or the indoor temperature reduction targets that are needed for a particular city to have a maximum desired heatwave mitigation impact however the model parameters have to be carefully selected after an accurate study of the domain literature keywords nature based solutions nbs individual based models heatwave mortality green roofs climate change adaptation 1 introduction the concept of nature based solutions nbs was introduced to promote the role of nature as a means for providing solutions to the global societal challenges of climate mitigation and adaptation cohen shacham et al eds 2016 european commission 2015 wamsler et al 2019 embedding nbs in cities can bring quantifiable climate resilience in terms amongst others of flooding drought and heat stress reduction for citizens or air quality improvement keeler et al 2019 lafortezza et al 2018 in this context since the benefits of nbs for citizens are largely influenced by how citizens utilise and interact with nbs in leisure and work frantzeskaki 2019 han and hyun 2019 mapping these interactions is instrumental monitoring local air quality due to the introduction of nbs like large parks is not enough to evaluate the actual benefits of these latter on citizens health also the extent to which citizens of various demographics visit such spaces as a result of factors like age and income is key to understand potential benefits the aim of the research presented in this work which is part of the h2020 project nature4cities 1 1 https www nature4cities eu grant n 730468 was to gain insights on the potential impacts caused by the introduction of new nbs in the urban environment on the citizens lives in particular this research analyses how green roofs installation can potentially mitigate the impact on human health more specifically on the occurrence of mortality induced by heatwaves determined by the reduction in indoor temperature that green roofs are able to induce the study analysed four different european cities taken as case studies szeged hungary alcalá de henares spain metropolitan city of milan italy and çankaya municipality turkey the study was conducted via the application of a particular type of individual based simulation approach microsimulation models msms msms are one of the three types of models that can be classified in the category of individual based models the other two being cellular automata ca and agent based models abms crooks and heppenstall 2012 abms represent the world as a set of individual objects called agents and a set of decision mechanisms that determine the way in which the agents act and interact marvuglia et al 2018 as abms also msms describe the population as a set of agents however although allowing for heterogeneity microsimulation does not allow interaction gilbert and troitzsch 2005 p 8 except marriages when the models are used to study population dynamics ca are similar to abms but they have the important distinguishing feature that the automata s location is fixed and they can only change their state while in abms the agents can also move and explore their environment crooks and heppenstall 2012 p 91 the model described in this paper can be classified as a static spatial microsimulation model according to the definition given in lawson 2009 p 4 our model is static in the sense that the effect of the stimulus coming from the external environment in this case the air temperature is calculated for each agent but then the results are aggregated to show the overall change in the mortality rate of the population which is aggregated in age classes the models is also spatial because the space dimension is taken into account in the fact that the spatial distribution of the buildings with and without green roofs is considered although the spatial differentiation of other important parameters that would also have an influence on the effect of heatwaves on the agents such as the spatial variability of the air temperature in the city and of the population density across the city and its distribution inside the buildings as well as their social and health conditions have not been taken into account 2 state of the art previous work focussing specifically on the application of agent based or microsimulations to address nbs does not exist as the two disciplines have not yet been combined in a unified cross disciplinary approach however it is relevant to remark that the term nbs is a very recent one in the scientific arena nature editorial 2017 nesshöver et al 2017 and therefore some applications of abm and to a more limited extent of msms to green infrastructures exist when the term nbs was not yet in use existing individual based simulation efforts that are related to nbs as such can be grouped into four use domains the effect of urban green infrastructures on housing markets and prices filatova 2015 freund 2018 roebeling et al 2017 the influence of green spaces and travel corridors on people s choice of transport modes aziz et al 2018 omer and kaplan 2017 the demographic and associated land use development of a city including green space and other urban ecosystems hayek et al 2015 ligmann zielinska and jankowski 2007 and their impacts on human well being and quality of life murray rust et al 2013 robinson et al 2012 the diffusion of rainwater catchment and collection green infrastructure systems and knowledge amongst citizens kandiah et al 2017 montalto et al 2013 the existing works whilst not specifically tailored to nbs already provide a number of helpful individual based simulations to gain insights within an urban context the literature especially provides a very good starting point for the areas of green infrastructures in particular domains such as transport infrastructure investment biodiversity and natural disasters other domains relevant for the implementation of nbs such as citizen health impacts required regulatory change or nbs scenario planning are instead currently not addressed to the best of the authors knowledge moreover the current literature focuses on green infrastructures in general morelle et al 2019 orsi 2019 yang et al 2019 and not on the study of specific types of nbs and their impacts in other words although the individual based simulation approach is employed to assess mechanisms of citizens behaviour its application in the context of nbs was so far missing the application described in this paper goes into the direction of filling this gap more specifically the micro simulation model is used to observe how green roof a particular type of nbs can mitigate the likelihood of mortality of elderly citizens in a city area due to heatwaves thus creating a direct observable coupling between a specific nbs and a socio economic impact 2 1 heatwave background the physiological consequences of prolonged exposure to heat and cold and the responsible mechanisms acting on the thermoregulation systems are well known in the literature hanna and tait 2015 since the frequency of extreme climate events has increased the mortality risk related to heatwaves is a more and more serious concern with cities being exposed to it at various degrees sheridan and allen 2015 smid et al 2019 the mortality risk of heatwaves has been analysed at a macro level by mora et al 2017 data from 911 heat wave studies including 1949 case studies were analysed to understand conditions under which heatwaves result in excess mortality above non heatwave mortality levels in order to do so an equal number of non heatwave episodes that were considered non lethal were introduced for the same cities as the meta literature data out of 16 different variables analysed the two conditions found most relevant were mean daily surface air temperature i e the temperature of the air near the surface of the earth and relative humidity these two variables combined explained the occurrence between lethal and non lethal heat episodes with 82 accuracy the effect of humidity is due to its impact on sweating sweating is a key process by which the body dissipates heat which becomes less effective when the air is very humid baccini m et al 2008 investigated the relationship between apparent temperature a combined measure of temperature and dew point as a proxy for humidity and heat mortality risk in 15 european cities they found a 2 to 3 heat mortality increase associated with a 1 c rise in apparent temperature ho et al 2017 looked at the humidex index a measure of apparent temperature used in canada and its relationship to heatwave mortality from 1998 to 2014 they found that above a humidex cut off point of 34 4 c there was a significant increase in heat mortality krstic et al 2017 developed three indices for greater vancouver canada using a set of 20 potentially predictive variables related to social vulnerability population density temperature exposure and urban form they found that maximum humidex values had a sharp inflection and steep slope compared with land surface temperature and maximum air temperature this was in line with the findings of ho et al 2017 that chose the maximum humidex variable to include it in the heat vulnerability index hvi studies have also shown that the duration of heat accumulation is important an analysis of heatwaves for australian cities xu and tong 2017 found the highest mortality risk when extremely hot days the hottest days in a given month were followed by extremely hot nights when extremely hot days were followed by lower temperature nights not extremely hot mortality increases were lower similarly when extremely hot nights were followed by lower temperature not extremely hot days the effects were much lower xu and tong 2017 the finding was corroborated by murage et al 2017 who studied heat mortality in london from 1993 to 2015 the authors found that hot days followed by hot nights have a higher mortality risk then hot days followed by cooler nights with the highest risk caused by stroke and heart failure 2 2 heatwave age risk groups urban citizens in densely built cities are adversely affected because of the urban heat island uhi effect which causes locally higher temperatures to occur cellura et al 2011 steeneveld et al 2018 especially vulnerable are elderly people with limited mobility who have limited means to seek cooling vandentorren et al 2006 baccini et al 2008 established a greater mortality risk for 65 74 year age groups and even greater at 75 versus 15 64 age groups associated with a 1 c rise above the apparent temperature mortality thresholds specifically the percent change for populations in mediterranean cities was 0 92 2 13 and 4 22 for 15 64 65 74 and 75 age groups respectively the variation for north continental cities was established at 1 31 1 65 and 2 07 for the same age groups with cardiovascular and respiratory mortality as main causes rey et al 2007 analysed the impact of heat waves on all cause mortality in france for six heatwaves from 1971 to 2003 they investigated groupings from 35 years 35 44 years 45 54 years and further 10 year groupings up to 95 mortality ratios were analysed based on observed mortality during heatwaves divided by expected mortality based on average mortality per group in the three preceding years in five out of six heatwaves the mortality ratios grow substantially from the age of 55 years and above especially populations of 75 years had a 40 higher mortality rate then in the background non heatwave data in addition for this group females had a 5 28 higher mortality rate than men 2 3 impacts of green infrastructures on indoor buildings temperatures green roofs are considered to generate a thermal effect on buildings niachou et al 2001 firstly soil may have a high capacity for thermal heat storage depending especially on its water retention capacity lowering heat transfer to a building sailor and hagos 2011 and improving indoor comfort conditions up to the second to last floor in some cases bevilacqua et al 2020 in case the green roof includes foliage it can also act as a shading device by absorbing part of the thermal energy for photosynthesis and lowering heat exchange under the foliage coma et al 2016 the choice of the types of plants has also an influence on cooling performances monteiro et al 2017 peri et al 2016 zhao et al 2014 with plants like salvia and stachys to be preferred to succulent plants for summertime environmental cooling and substrate insulation monteiro et al 2017 finally soil and vegetation create cooling effects through evapotranspiration berardi et al 2014 and the vegetation acts on the albedo of the roof increasing it from values of 0 1 0 2 typical of bitumen tar and gravel roofs to values ranging from 0 7 to 0 85 saadatian et al 2013 green roofs reflect about 20 30 of solar radiation and absorb about 60 of heat in photosynthesis with only 20 transmitted to the growing medium below thereby they reduce heat flow by 70 90 in summer and about 10 30 in winter depending on the climate zone berardi et al 2014 section s1 of the supporting information si file reports a series of studies about the temperature reduction effect of green roofs in different geographical locations the studies suggest as a first approximation that green roofs can lower indoor air temperatures by 1 5 c to 3 c depending on the external climate conditions and physical composition of the green roof relative to flat conventional roofs and that this effect can be amplified when combined with ventilation measures during the night as further illustrated in section 3 1 this value was assumed in the present simulation model as basis to support the air temperature mitigation potential of green roofs 3 materials and methods 3 1 case study urban heat mortality impacts reduction through nbs the msm proposed here looks at the impact of temperature in the city on local mortality during heatwave episodes the model focuses on a number of elderly citizens in a city area and aims at simulating how they are affected by heatwaves in terms of the likelihood of mortality the simulation utilises a ceteris paribus modelling approach meaning that the relationship of the observed phenomenon mortality induced by heatwaves with other possible influencing factors e g level of sport and physical activities practiced by people are not taken into account modelling approaches based on ceteris paribus are commonly utilized in economics to assert economic impacts of policies bierens and swanson 2000 the adoption of this approach in this study inevitably implies a simplification of the behavioural mechanism simulated to identify vulnerabilities that increase or decrease the likelihood of heatwave mortality however this simplification is necessary in order to keep the model manageable and to not incur into the risk of obtaining results that because of the effect of an over detailed representation over parametrisation without the possibility of a proper calibration of the many parameters involved in the end would not properly reflect the reality because the model would have a low generalization capacity sun et al 2016 for this reason complicated individual based simulation models with many parameters have been criticized rand and rust 2011 the microsimulation model was implemented in the very popular netlogo 2 2 https ccl northwestern edu netlogo software version 6 0 4 fig 1 shows a screenshot of the interface built in netlogo 3 2 city selection and data mapping the nature4cities project covered four cities szeged alcalá de henares metropolitan city of milan and çankaya municipality and for each of them a simulation was run based on cityspecific data both population data and land use data were used to allocate numbers of elderly 65 people to areas in the city with buildings both datasets were obtained from the urban atlas 2012 dataset from the eu copernicus programme 3 3 https land copernicus eu local urban atlas urban atlas 2012 this had the advantage to run simulations consistently across cities as these used exactly the same input data that are harmonized to a similar quality standard the dataset provided 29 types of land use in geographic information system gis for 800 functional urban areas fua in the eea39 countries which includes the above mentioned four project cities municipalities 4 4 https www nature4cities eu blog categories pilot cities and sites european space agency 2016 the eu copernicus programme provided also population distributions for 2012 including age groupings which were linked to the spatial data in the absence of building data indicating the elderly population distribution within the city the population was allocated randomly to areas with land use urban fabric as per the urban atlas 2012 dataset population values were obtained by copernicus developers through down scaling census data from country and city censuses to polygons in the copernicus fua datasets the simulations were initialised with a representative sample of the elderly population estimated at 1 of the total elderly population to enable the models to operate in a parsimonious manner 3 3 temperature scenarios temperature scenarios can be inserted in the simulation to analyse impacts of current and future climate temperature were thereby incorporated exogenously into the model the surface air temperature and humidity data recorded in 2016 by the closest local weather stations located within or close to the studied cities were used to simulate the past past data were available up to 2018 but only data from 2016 were used because this was the only year with complete data sets no missing values for all the four cities in addition temperature for climate change projections up to 2100 was used the temperature projections for the years 2030 2050 2070 and 2090 were based on ipcc rcp8 5 climate scenario set with country and regional data developed in the coupled model intercomparison project 5 5 https pcmdi llnl gov mips cmip5 cmip5 these are based on an ensemble of climate models for each of the four representative concentration pathways rcps scenarios globally

number of tropical nights 20 c are available per country and per month the variance calculated with the data from 2016 was superimposed to the monthly average temperatures obtained from ipcc scenarios so to generate a dataset with daily variability in the absence of future climate change projections that have a daily interval for the sake of simplicity it was assumed that the outdoor temperature for the data series is similar across the city the simulated temperature was subsequently translated into an indoor air temperature directly as a simplifying assumption in case of presence of green roofs based on the reviewed literature it was assumed that an indoor temperature reduction between 1 5 c and 3 c is possible see section 2 3 as compared to the case without a green roof given the uncertainty within this range caused amongst other factors by the variation in climate conditions and green roof type the specific temperature reduction within this range can be set by the model user thereby the simulation allows for exploring the impact of different green roofs from very effective to moderately effective the relationships as established from the literature were translated into a set of model functions first the outdoor temperature datasets were established location specific datasets for ground station based air temperature and dew point evolution over time are loaded as inputs with variations per hour for temperature and per month for dew point 3 4 model setup a total of 360 model runs were made for each city first a no heatwave baseline model where the mortality effects from heatwaves were turned off was run for comparative purposes as a second step the outdoor air temperature was made vary between five simulated temperature years 2016 2030 2050 2070 and 2090 third for each of these years with heatwave effects seven variants were simulated without green roofs with 30 60 and 100 of the existing houses occupied by elderly population covered by green roofs in an hypothetical scenario without accounting for any exclusion due to possible constraints or restrictions to the green roofs installation and with 1 5 and 3 degree temperature reduction impact due to green roofs finally each of these different models was run 10 times to obtain a min max range and average value to establish a distribution of the variation 3 5 agents selection elderly background mortality the population analysed in the simulation comprised elderly people aged 65 as a single category the reason for selecting this range is data availability given that urban atlas data only specified age groups from 0 to 14 0 to 64 years and 64 years of age background mortality rates were analysed for each city from the statistical office data to understand the non heatwave related rate of deaths for citizens aged 65 or older number of deaths of elderly people above the age of 65 per year dt were divided by elderly population numbers p to obtain a probability of death per year and translated to a daily mortality rate m d by dividing by the number of days in a year eq 1 1 m d d t p 365 to simulate the background mortality of elderly people in each 24 hour period and for each agent a probability roll was made between 0 and 1 if the roll was falling above the mortality rate per day the agent was removed from the simulation as if mortality had occurred this is to be interpreted as a transition probability that determines the switch of an agent from one state alive to the other dead 3 6 heatwave mortality impacts the impact of heatwaves was based on baccini m et al 2008 which established a combined measure of temperature and dew point as a proxy for humidity and related it to heat mortality risk in 15 european cities the study was selected because of three reasons 1 firstly the widespread coverage across 15 cities in europe including athens barcelona budapest dublin helsinki ljubljana london milan paris prague rome stockholm turin valencia and zurich these covered three out of the four countries used as case studies in the nature4cities project and also values for north continental and mediterranean cities that could be used for the country of the missing city 2 secondly the inclusion of temperature and humidity effects by a measure of apparent temperature at 3 thirdly the split of results into different age group types 15 64 65 74 and 75 years the formula used to calculate at in celsius degrees is defined in baccini m et al 2008 as shown in eq 2 2 a t 2 653 0 994 t 0 0153 w 2 where t outdoor dry bulb air temperature c w dew point c the value of at calculated by eq 2 was compared with the threshold values summarised in table 2 derived from baccini et al 2008 above which increased mortality occurred the threshold mortality values used in the simulation are across all age groups change all in table 2 as indicated in the table in absence of results provided by baccini m et al 2008 for specific cities for the 65 74 and 75 years age ranges as also indicated in the table in the simulation for each day when at was above the threshold in the city the mortality percent increase ratio was applied as per table 2 this simulated the compound effect of heatwave impacts on mortality including and excluding the possible installation of green roofs 3 7 model flow the flowchart presented in fig 2 describes the sequence of the steps performed in the model 1 for each city we calculate the average per month and across age ranges daily background mortality rates bmr of elderly people using eq 1 the values obtained are reported in table 3 note that the values change monthly only for one city alcalá de henares due to the lack of available monthly mortality data for the other three cities 2 for each of the four studied cities we use the daily values of t and w recorded in 2016 to calculate the at for that year 3 as described in section 3 3 by superimposing the variance calculated from the 2016 data to the future values of monthly temperatures derived from the ipcc rcp8 5 scenario we generate daily values of t for future years and store them in cvs files note that the ipcc rcp8 5 scenarios do not cover future values for w therefore they could not be incorporated and historic values were retained 4 we use these values of t and w to calculate future years daily values of at using eq 2 5 using the values contained in table 2 and the predicted at values for future years calculated at step 4 we calculate for each city the average daily percentage mortality increase pmi during heatwave events to apply for each celsius degree above the threshold value of at 6 for each agent we modify the variable city mortality rates cmr as indicated in fig 2 where heatwave is a binary variable which takes value 1 if at is higher than the threshold temperature value indicated in table 2 for the city where the agent is located i e if the threshold exceedance te is greater than zero and the value 0 otherwise gr is a binary variable which takes the value 0 if on the building where the agent is located there is a traditional roof and the value 1 if a green roof is installed on it 7 for each agent and each month a value between 0 and 1 is extracted from a uniform probability distribution and if the value is above cmr then the agent is removed from the simulation thus simulating its death and the counter for the number of deaths nd is increased by one unit 4 results this section summarises the results of the simulations for the four cities and eight different scenarios from 2016 to 2090 based on variations in green roofs coverage and impact range from 1 5 c to 3 c temperature reduction due to the presence of green roofs the black squares in figs 3 6 represent the number of annual mortality cases values to be read in the left vertical axis while the whiskers indicate the upper and lower values of the mortality the blue circles whose values have to be read in the right vertical axis represent the additional number of mortality cases with respect to the background mortality i e with respect to the number of mortality cases that would occur amongst elderly people even in the absence of heatwave events 4 1 results for szeged hungary the simulation area was selected to cover the centre of szeged with surrounding areas and satellite peri urban areas figure s1 a total of 1600 elderly citizens were simulated in the model runs using the procedure described in section 3 5 the background mortality impact in 2016 for szeged was estimated at 73 mortalities which is close to 5 of the elderly population the threshold value of the apparent temperature after which heatwave mortality occurs was set to 22 8 c value for budapest in table 2 the effect of a simulated heatwave in 2016 is to increase the mortality to 122 per year which is above 8 of the elderly population above 65 of age see table s1 the results suggest that green roofs can if rolled out across all buildings with elderly people reduce heatwave mortality by over 80 in case of a 3 c indoor temperature reduction in comparison a 1 5 c indoor temperature reduction results in over 50 reduction in heatwave induced deaths the heatwave mortality reduction effect for 2090 in szeged is still high despite growing outdoor air temperatures table 4 shows the percent variations in heatwave mortality cases induced by the different future temperature scenarios with respect to the case of absence of green roofs 0 green roofs coverage the values have been calculated by subtracting the background mortality cases i e the ones that occur with no heatwave from the total number of mortality cases so to make sure that only mortality due to heatwave is taken into account the negative value slight increase of heatwave mortality cases in 2030 for the case of 30 green roof coverage and 1 5 c impact is due to the fact that average 2030 temperature in the ipcc future climate scenarios for hungary are arguably lower than the 2016 temperature levels from the results of the simulations one can infer that the reduced indoor temperatures caused by the presence of green roofs are insufficient to fully mitigate the effects of growing temperatures across the century due to climate change but still can reduce the impact by half in case of 3 c indoor temperature reductions see table 4 table s1 and fig 3 4 2 results for alcalá de henares spain the simulation area was selected to include the city centre of alcalá de henares with surrounding areas and satellite peri urban areas figure s2 the whole area includes the edible forest nbs use case proposed as a green space in the nature4cities project nature4cities 2019 the same area was used across all the three simulations whose results are summarised in table 5 a total of 2900 citizens were simulated in the model runs in this case the methodology described in section 3 5 estimated the background mortality for 2016 as 117 mortalities during the year or at 6 of the elderly population the threshold value of the apparent temperature was set in this case to 22 4 c value for barcelona in table 2 the impact of a simulated heatwave in 2016 increases the mortality to 284 per year or close to 15 of the elderly population above 65 years of age see table s2 in this year if rolled out across all buildings with elderly people green roofs can reduce heatwave mortality by 67 if we assume they are able to cause a 3 c indoor temperature reduction a 1 5 c indoor temperature reduction results instead in almost 44 reduction in heatwave mortality cases still when achieved across all buildings the heatwave mortality reduction impact for future years in alcalá de henares remains relevant although it is progressively reduced year after year due to rapidly increasing outdoor temperatures table 5 shows the percent variations in heatwave mortality cases induced by the different scenarios with respect to the case of absence of green roofs 0 green roofs coverage the mortality cases reduce in 2030 and 2050 because the temperature datasets for spain exhibit cooler temperatures in those decades then today based on the ipcc average temperature forecasts by reducing indoor temperatures by 3 c green roofs can then provide substantial mortality reductions consistently bringing mortality cases to less than half for the 21st century and close to zero for the first half of the century see table 5 table s2 and fig 4 4 3 results for the metropolitan city of milan italy the simulation area was based on a portion of the north of the milan metropolitan area cantered on the quarry restoration site in parco nord about 15 km north of milan city centre selected with surrounding neighbourhoods figure s3 a total of 5600 citizens were simulated in the model runs the background mortality impact for the metropolitan city of milan is estimated again using the method described in section 3 5 for 2016 at 227 mortalities during the year or 4 of the elderly population 65 the threshold value of the apparent temperature was set in this case to 31 8 c see table 2 the impact of a simulated heatwave in 2016 only negligibly increases the mortality to 228 per year see table s3 in 2016 even if green roofs are rolled out across all the buildings with elderly people they do not have a beneficial effect on heatwave induced mortality reduction even in the hypothesis of a 3 c indoor temperature reduction capacity this is also the case for future temperatures in some cases see table 6 table s3 and fig 5 there are two reasons why the heatwaves in the simulation do not have a relevant mortality impact first due to a very high temperature threshold found in the literature at which mortality starts to increase as such increasing temperatures do not have increasing mortality effects and thereby green roofs do not reduce such mortalities as they do not occur even in the case of no green roofs roll out second because the average monthly ipcc cmip5 scenarios for italy do not result in any future year 2030 2050 2070 2090 in temperatures above the high threshold therefore running the scenarios never results in any heatwave impacts in the first place as such model runs with green roofs are similar in impact on mortality to model runs without green roofs and thereby the model gives what appears to be a counterintuitive result if green roofs are present the number of mortalities increases even with respect to the case of no heatwave this is reflected in the negative values of the percentage variations in heatwave mortality cases induced by the different scenarios with respect to the case of absence of green roofs 0 green roofs coverage shown in table 6 this can largely be explained by the effect of randomness in absence of a significant change in future temperature in the ipcc cmip5 scenarios combined with a lack of a green roof effect since the number of model runs is quite limited 10 runs for each scenario to keep computational time reasonable there is a possibility that in absence of strong effects the mortality is higher in one given set of 10 model runs on average versus another set of 10 model runs as mentioned 360 model runs were carried out in total for a city based on scenario settings including the variation in green roof temperature impact share of people living under a green roof and temperature years 2016 2030 2050 2070 2090 for the case of 2050 as the mean number of mortality cases with no heatwave coincides with the number of mortality case in the scenario of 0 green roofs roll out 227 cases the baseline for calculation is zero cases therefore a percentage variation makes no sense division by zero in this case we have therefore reported directly the number of reduced mortality cases to make a distinction with the other values in the table which are percentage values the entries of the column referred to the year 2050 are reported in brackets negative values indicate an increase instead of a reduction of the number of mortality cases in the scenario for 2090 green roofs start again to have a positive effect on the reduction of heatwave mortality cases in every percentage of coverage of the roofs of the studied area and in both the indoor temperature reduction capacity hypotheses 1 5 c and 3 c however also this is an effect of the randomised impact of mortality and not due to green roofs given the high temperature mortality threshold and cmip5 temperatures remaining below this threshold in all scenarios 4 4 results for çankaya municipality turkey the simulation area was based on the south east portion of ankara where çankaya municipality is located figure s4 a total of 3000 citizens were simulated in the model runs the background mortality impact was estimated with the same methodology as for the other cases it resulted for 2016 in 119 mortalities during the year or close to 4 of the elderly population 65 the threshold value of the apparent temperature was set in this case to 29 4 c the value referring to mediterranean region in table 2 the impact of a simulated heatwave in 2016 increases the mortality to 147 cases per year or about 5 0 of the elderly population see table s4 green roofs in 2016 across all buildings with elderly people have a negligible result on heatwave induced mortality reduction both in the case of a 1 5 c and 3 c indoor hypothetic temperature reduction capacity the reason is that the heatwave impact is limited in 2016 based on temperature estimates for that year the heatwave mortality reduction impact for future years in çankaya municipality becomes increasingly prominent as the temperature increases across the century as such the reduced indoor temperatures can substantially mitigate the effects of growing temperatures across the century due to climate change reducing heatwave induced mortality up to 75 especially in case of 3 c indoor temperature reductions see table 7 table s4 and fig 6 5 conclusion the paper shows an application of a microsimulation model to simulate the urban heatwave induced mortality reduction as a consequence of potential roll out of green roofs across four different cities in europe szeged in hungary alcalá de henares in spain çankaya municipality in turkey and the metropolitan city of milan in italy without such a simulation one could gain insights based on background literature on the degree of the mortality effect in terms of proportion of the affected population but would miss a number of relevant key areas for decision making the simulation helps to localize the results to a city and particular scenarios therein and provides additional insights such as on future temperature scenarios under climate change and on how green roofs can assist with mortality reduction not only today but also under future climate conditions as the effect of global warming furthermore the simulation allows to easily gain insights in a plug and play manner on the benchmark temperature reduction that is needed for a particular city to have a maximum desired impact such as 1 5 c or 3 c indoor temperature reduction as simulated in this paper the results of the simulations showed substantial variation of the impacts of green roof installation on heatwave induced mortality cases across cities in the case of szeged alcalá de henares and çankaya municipality a substantial reduction in heatwave induced mortality was found to occur for the present time and even more for future years 2030 2050 2070 2090 especially as the average outdoor temperatures become higher across the 21st century in the case of the metropolitan city of milan the results have to be taken with more caution in this case green roofs showed low or any mitigation impact in certain cases because heatwaves had little additional mortality effects in the simulations in the first place the underlying factor is the temperature threshold above which heatwave mortality occurs which was inferred from the literature to be substantial higher in the metropolitan city of milan 31 8 c than in other cities further investigation of the temperature mortality relationship would be needed to shed more light on the wide range of differences between cities but nonetheless the results encourage in considering green roofs as a temperature mitigation technology for climate resilient cities taking into account city demographics and ageing populations during the 21st century this can help to support the design of nbs that have a temperature mitigation impact especially for property managers that focus on vulnerable elderly populations contributing to the identification of key importance aspects that shall be taken into account in the implementation models of nbs to address climate change related effects 6 discussion 6 1 limitations of the model the model provides insights on the effect of heatwaves on mortality under current and future temperatures specified per city and according to different scenarios of green roofs implementation in its current form the model has some limitations we will not discuss here the limitations that are intrinsic in the model building that are due to the simplifications we induce in the representation of real phenomena because they pertain to every model to some extent and they have been partly discussed in section 3 1 here we will briefly enumerate the limitations due to the input data of the model firstly it uses outdoor air temperature measurements based on a single weather station within the city and extrapolates that across the entire simulated city area therefore the results are not representative of particular locations and can only be interpreted at the aggregated level of the simulated area city block or building specific models can be built but they would require an understanding of how the make up of a locality in terms of building types and built area influence localised temperatures as well as data to enable an accurate up to date localised representation of said built area they would require a larger number of temperature point measurements across the area especially if this latter spans over several kilometres to partially overcome some of these limitations the model could be improved considering uhi effects based on accurate spatial distributions of temperature across the city several approaches have been used in the literature to derive such distributions some of them start from real measurements of air temperature with weather stations and apply nonlinear models to forecast temperature over time and map them across space but without using urban morphological factors or heat balance equations cellura et al 2011 other approaches use remote sensing images coupled with ground truth data of urban albedo and heat flux models bonafoni et al 2017 wang et al 2019 or machine learning models oh et al 2020 to estimate albedo and land surface temperature variations across time and space many approaches are based on extensive measurements across the city romero rodríguez et al 2020 while bueno et al 2013 calculate urban air temperature and humidity values using weather data measured outside the city and solving heat transfer equations and litardo et al 2020 apply the model described in bueno et al 2013 after performing a k means clustering to distinguish different homogeneous types of urban morphologies however we need to underline that applying these sophisticated models would have been out of the scope of this paper moreover one could have fully taken advantage of the increased accuracy obtained with such detailed uhi estimation models only if this could be also coupled on the other side with a higher accuracy in the distribution of vulnerable people in the buildings which is instead done randomly in this paper because of lack of data secondly the future temperature scenarios are based on a monthly average increase or decrease estimates over future years the estimated values have been superimposed on variability in the present for this reason expected increasing future variability in temperature e g extremely high and low temperatures during the year is not accounted for this superimposition approach was selected as current climate change models cannot provide valid local future fluctuations in temperature but only reasonable estimates from country to regional level long term trends ipcc 2013 however since mortality depends on reaching threshold temperatures the variability between days within a month can increase or decrease which can dampen or exacerbate the future impact as there may be more or less extreme temperature variations within a single month to incorporate this variability climate change models would need to provide valid daily variations which is currently not feasible thirdly the outdoor temperatures were assumed to be representative of indoor temperatures as a substantial simplification since understanding the impact of different building construction types on temperature gradients from outdoor to indoor was outside of the scope of the model study for a realistic impact assessment such effects would need to be considered as some buildings will worsen and others reduce the temperature effects across the day and at night this reinforces the earlier consideration that results cannot be interpreted on a location specific basis in the current state of the model but can be interpreted only based on a macro level effect fourthly the impact of short term weather patterns on mortality has not been incorporated in the model rules in the literature a stronger mortality impact has been hypothesised of a cumulative number of hot days and or hot nights following each other compared to a scattered number of hot days and hot nights across a period when controlling for time lags and cooler control days several studies have looked at this effect of temporal stratification of weather including evaluations of hot days hot nights cool days cool nights and control days ho et al 2017 murage et al 2017 xu and tong 2017 since the results in these studies are not uniform more analysis is needed to ascertain why there are substantial differences in the evaluated impacts in order to be able to establish valid model rules for example xu and tong 2017 found that heatwaves with extremely hot days followed by not extremely hot nights results in mortality increases in 2 out of the 3 studied cities without a clear explanation of this lack of uniformity finally the relationship between apparent temperature and mortality was taken as established from a literature study baccini m et al 2008 p 716 which found substantial heterogeneity between cities in terms of threshold temperatures at which mortality begins to occur and also in the effect per each celsius degree of temperature above the threshold the rationale for this heterogeneity is not known at any level of precision and the relationship between heat and health risk is still a studied matter cheng et al 2019 various reasons can cause this variation vargo et al 2016 including socio demographic gronlund 2014 li et al 2019 behavioural and health related ones due to pre existing conditions medina ramón and schwartz 2007 vandentorren et al 2006 and the existing ability of buildings to provide cooler indoor spaces especially if equipped with air conditioning barreca et al 2016 farbotko and waitt 2011 or to exacerbate higher temperatures from outdoor to indoor see guo et al 2017 and references therein several of these relationships prompt the potential for expansion of the model to take into account both static and interactive effects related to health and care settings such as bed confinement and availability of care to support social activities showering ingestion of liquids and opening of windows as behaviours shown to reduce heatwave mortality vandentorren et al 2006 for a better understanding heat augmenting or reducing impacts as well as mortality would need to be studied relative to temperature variations on a longitudinal basis in any case the lack of information about the distribution of vulnerable people such as elderly of 65 years of age and people with mental or physical health conditions within each building as well as area by area prevented a better precision of the model in this respect one needs to specify that the beneficial effect of green roofs in terms of temperature reductions can be felt only by the occupants of the last floor and partially of the second to last floor at best but since the distribution of the vulnerable dwellers in the buildings is not known it is not possible to estimate what percentage of the vulnerable population would be positively affected by the presence of green roofs what is interesting to remark is however that the people living in the last floors of the buildings are the ones who suffer the most the effects of heatwaves because of the additional heat slowly released by the ceiling owing to its thermal inertia which becomes very hot across the day due to direct solar irradiation therefore if vulnerable people live in the last floors their vulnerability results increased in our model we assume that if the green roof allows keeping the apparent temperature below the alarm threshold that would cause an increase in heatwave related deaths as individuated in the cited study by baccini et al 2008 it saves the life of an agent which is supposed to live in the last floor of a building in the scope of this paper we do not make use of population density data inside the city in fact our maps only show the locations of the buildings and not the population density in the areas where the buildings are located if these other pieces of information were incorporated in the model more targeted infrastructure options could be evaluated for more effective mitigation options 6 2 applicability of green roofs as a climate change adaptation solution in order to get a feedback about the potential of the model from one side and the applicability of the green roofs as a climate change adaptation solution on the other side a meeting with the policymakers from the four partners cities involved in the nature4cities project was organized to showcase the scenarios described in the paper after the presentation the policymakers were interviewed about the following aspects 1 impressions first glace impression about the model is it understandable can they relate to it 2 usefulness how the model could be of help and for which specific problems it may be particularly useful in the city planning context 3 timing at which stage of the planning and decision making process the presented simulation models could possibly be useful 4 limitations the challenges the interviewee sees with using the results that impose a limitation on the usefulness 5 recommendations the kind of adjustments and improvements needed to increase its usability the model was evaluated positively because it shows that green roofs have a substantial impact on reducing heat in buildings except than in the case of milan which in effect reduce the chances of heatwave mortality the scenario thereby illustrates a solid relationship between heat health and nbs this could be used to create more support for nbs and to ensure that investments e g finances human resources are well spent one interviewee mentioned that green roofs are not considered as a viable option but only when a scenario in which census data and heat island effect are combined to identify pocket areas where interventions are urgently needed the municipality might take this option under consideration despite the positive feedback the interviewees were generally hesitant to consider green roofs as a suitable nbs intervention within their context the main reasons are i green roofs are expensive and therefore not easily affordable in residential buildings which are not public but in private ownership this aspect has indeed already been investigated in other studies blackhurst et al 2010 concluding that green roofs are not cost effective on a private basis but they become more competitive on multifamily and commercial buildings when social attenuation of the uhi greenhouse gases emissions reduction and storm water runoff reduction and aesthetic benefits are also taken into account in more mature markets the payback time of green roofs becomes lower than their lifetime thus encouraging to a larger scale implementation which will considerably increase their social benefits feng and hewage 2018 ii some buildings have monumental or architectural status or the roofs are too steep and thus not suitable for greening iii in some cases there is a lack of expertise to create green roofs nevertheless the model set up offering the quantifiable results makes it usable and interesting for further

24726,embedding nature based solutions nbs in cities is expected to bring quantifiable benefits including resilience to flooding drought and heatwaves and air quality improvement among nbs green roofs have an important role in temperature regulation in buildings and in lowering the damaging effects of heatwaves on human health in this paper a spatial microsimulation model is implemented to simulate temperature impacts of green roofs installations in cities and their capacity to attenuate the effects of heatwave episodes particularly vulnerable to heatwaves are elderly people with limited mobility who have limited means to seek cooling and create cooler indoor environments the model implemented using the netlogo platform version 6 0 4 considers as agents the elderly citizens in a city area and simulates the heatwave related health impacts which are measured in mortality likelihood in particular the model simulates a generalised 1 5 c to 3 c indoor temperature reduction range induced by green roofs based on inferences from green roof literature in four different european cities szeged hungary alcalá de henares spain metropolitan city of milan italy and çankaya municipality turkey the simulation utilises a ceteris paribus modelling approach meaning that the relationships of the observed phenomenon mortality induced by heatwaves with other possible influencing factors e g level of sport and physical activities practiced by people are not taken into account in the case of szeged alcalá de henares and çankaya municipality a substantial reduction in mortality is found to occur associated with green roofs roll out in the case of the metropolitan city of milan green roofs installations show a low mitigation effect in some scenarios the underlying factor is the temperature threshold parameter of the model above which heatwave mortality occurs this parameter was inferred from the literature baccini m et al 2008 and it resulted to be substantially higher in the metropolitan city of milan 31 8 c than in the other cities the simulation helps in obtaining results which are specific to a given city and particular scenarios therein and provides additional insights such as expected temperature mitigation effect induced by green roofs under climate change conditions or the indoor temperature reduction targets that are needed for a particular city to have a maximum desired heatwave mitigation impact however the model parameters have to be carefully selected after an accurate study of the domain literature keywords nature based solutions nbs individual based models heatwave mortality green roofs climate change adaptation 1 introduction the concept of nature based solutions nbs was introduced to promote the role of nature as a means for providing solutions to the global societal challenges of climate mitigation and adaptation cohen shacham et al eds 2016 european commission 2015 wamsler et al 2019 embedding nbs in cities can bring quantifiable climate resilience in terms amongst others of flooding drought and heat stress reduction for citizens or air quality improvement keeler et al 2019 lafortezza et al 2018 in this context since the benefits of nbs for citizens are largely influenced by how citizens utilise and interact with nbs in leisure and work frantzeskaki 2019 han and hyun 2019 mapping these interactions is instrumental monitoring local air quality due to the introduction of nbs like large parks is not enough to evaluate the actual benefits of these latter on citizens health also the extent to which citizens of various demographics visit such spaces as a result of factors like age and income is key to understand potential benefits the aim of the research presented in this work which is part of the h2020 project nature4cities 1 1 https www nature4cities eu grant n 730468 was to gain insights on the potential impacts caused by the introduction of new nbs in the urban environment on the citizens lives in particular this research analyses how green roofs installation can potentially mitigate the impact on human health more specifically on the occurrence of mortality induced by heatwaves determined by the reduction in indoor temperature that green roofs are able to induce the study analysed four different european cities taken as case studies szeged hungary alcalá de henares spain metropolitan city of milan italy and çankaya municipality turkey the study was conducted via the application of a particular type of individual based simulation approach microsimulation models msms msms are one of the three types of models that can be classified in the category of individual based models the other two being cellular automata ca and agent based models abms crooks and heppenstall 2012 abms represent the world as a set of individual objects called agents and a set of decision mechanisms that determine the way in which the agents act and interact marvuglia et al 2018 as abms also msms describe the population as a set of agents however although allowing for heterogeneity microsimulation does not allow interaction gilbert and troitzsch 2005 p 8 except marriages when the models are used to study population dynamics ca are similar to abms but they have the important distinguishing feature that the automata s location is fixed and they can only change their state while in abms the agents can also move and explore their environment crooks and heppenstall 2012 p 91 the model described in this paper can be classified as a static spatial microsimulation model according to the definition given in lawson 2009 p 4 our model is static in the sense that the effect of the stimulus coming from the external environment in this case the air temperature is calculated for each agent but then the results are aggregated to show the overall change in the mortality rate of the population which is aggregated in age classes the models is also spatial because the space dimension is taken into account in the fact that the spatial distribution of the buildings with and without green roofs is considered although the spatial differentiation of other important parameters that would also have an influence on the effect of heatwaves on the agents such as the spatial variability of the air temperature in the city and of the population density across the city and its distribution inside the buildings as well as their social and health conditions have not been taken into account 2 state of the art previous work focussing specifically on the application of agent based or microsimulations to address nbs does not exist as the two disciplines have not yet been combined in a unified cross disciplinary approach however it is relevant to remark that the term nbs is a very recent one in the scientific arena nature editorial 2017 nesshöver et al 2017 and therefore some applications of abm and to a more limited extent of msms to green infrastructures exist when the term nbs was not yet in use existing individual based simulation efforts that are related to nbs as such can be grouped into four use domains the effect of urban green infrastructures on housing markets and prices filatova 2015 freund 2018 roebeling et al 2017 the influence of green spaces and travel corridors on people s choice of transport modes aziz et al 2018 omer and kaplan 2017 the demographic and associated land use development of a city including green space and other urban ecosystems hayek et al 2015 ligmann zielinska and jankowski 2007 and their impacts on human well being and quality of life murray rust et al 2013 robinson et al 2012 the diffusion of rainwater catchment and collection green infrastructure systems and knowledge amongst citizens kandiah et al 2017 montalto et al 2013 the existing works whilst not specifically tailored to nbs already provide a number of helpful individual based simulations to gain insights within an urban context the literature especially provides a very good starting point for the areas of green infrastructures in particular domains such as transport infrastructure investment biodiversity and natural disasters other domains relevant for the implementation of nbs such as citizen health impacts required regulatory change or nbs scenario planning are instead currently not addressed to the best of the authors knowledge moreover the current literature focuses on green infrastructures in general morelle et al 2019 orsi 2019 yang et al 2019 and not on the study of specific types of nbs and their impacts in other words although the individual based simulation approach is employed to assess mechanisms of citizens behaviour its application in the context of nbs was so far missing the application described in this paper goes into the direction of filling this gap more specifically the micro simulation model is used to observe how green roof a particular type of nbs can mitigate the likelihood of mortality of elderly citizens in a city area due to heatwaves thus creating a direct observable coupling between a specific nbs and a socio economic impact 2 1 heatwave background the physiological consequences of prolonged exposure to heat and cold and the responsible mechanisms acting on the thermoregulation systems are well known in the literature hanna and tait 2015 since the frequency of extreme climate events has increased the mortality risk related to heatwaves is a more and more serious concern with cities being exposed to it at various degrees sheridan and allen 2015 smid et al 2019 the mortality risk of heatwaves has been analysed at a macro level by mora et al 2017 data from 911 heat wave studies including 1949 case studies were analysed to understand conditions under which heatwaves result in excess mortality above non heatwave mortality levels in order to do so an equal number of non heatwave episodes that were considered non lethal were introduced for the same cities as the meta literature data out of 16 different variables analysed the two conditions found most relevant were mean daily surface air temperature i e the temperature of the air near the surface of the earth and relative humidity these two variables combined explained the occurrence between lethal and non lethal heat episodes with 82 accuracy the effect of humidity is due to its impact on sweating sweating is a key process by which the body dissipates heat which becomes less effective when the air is very humid baccini m et al 2008 investigated the relationship between apparent temperature a combined measure of temperature and dew point as a proxy for humidity and heat mortality risk in 15 european cities they found a 2 to 3 heat mortality increase associated with a 1 c rise in apparent temperature ho et al 2017 looked at the humidex index a measure of apparent temperature used in canada and its relationship to heatwave mortality from 1998 to 2014 they found that above a humidex cut off point of 34 4 c there was a significant increase in heat mortality krstic et al 2017 developed three indices for greater vancouver canada using a set of 20 potentially predictive variables related to social vulnerability population density temperature exposure and urban form they found that maximum humidex values had a sharp inflection and steep slope compared with land surface temperature and maximum air temperature this was in line with the findings of ho et al 2017 that chose the maximum humidex variable to include it in the heat vulnerability index hvi studies have also shown that the duration of heat accumulation is important an analysis of heatwaves for australian cities xu and tong 2017 found the highest mortality risk when extremely hot days the hottest days in a given month were followed by extremely hot nights when extremely hot days were followed by lower temperature nights not extremely hot mortality increases were lower similarly when extremely hot nights were followed by lower temperature not extremely hot days the effects were much lower xu and tong 2017 the finding was corroborated by murage et al 2017 who studied heat mortality in london from 1993 to 2015 the authors found that hot days followed by hot nights have a higher mortality risk then hot days followed by cooler nights with the highest risk caused by stroke and heart failure 2 2 heatwave age risk groups urban citizens in densely built cities are adversely affected because of the urban heat island uhi effect which causes locally higher temperatures to occur cellura et al 2011 steeneveld et al 2018 especially vulnerable are elderly people with limited mobility who have limited means to seek cooling vandentorren et al 2006 baccini et al 2008 established a greater mortality risk for 65 74 year age groups and even greater at 75 versus 15 64 age groups associated with a 1 c rise above the apparent temperature mortality thresholds specifically the percent change for populations in mediterranean cities was 0 92 2 13 and 4 22 for 15 64 65 74 and 75 age groups respectively the variation for north continental cities was established at 1 31 1 65 and 2 07 for the same age groups with cardiovascular and respiratory mortality as main causes rey et al 2007 analysed the impact of heat waves on all cause mortality in france for six heatwaves from 1971 to 2003 they investigated groupings from 35 years 35 44 years 45 54 years and further 10 year groupings up to 95 mortality ratios were analysed based on observed mortality during heatwaves divided by expected mortality based on average mortality per group in the three preceding years in five out of six heatwaves the mortality ratios grow substantially from the age of 55 years and above especially populations of 75 years had a 40 higher mortality rate then in the background non heatwave data in addition for this group females had a 5 28 higher mortality rate than men 2 3 impacts of green infrastructures on indoor buildings temperatures green roofs are considered to generate a thermal effect on buildings niachou et al 2001 firstly soil may have a high capacity for thermal heat storage depending especially on its water retention capacity lowering heat transfer to a building sailor and hagos 2011 and improving indoor comfort conditions up to the second to last floor in some cases bevilacqua et al 2020 in case the green roof includes foliage it can also act as a shading device by absorbing part of the thermal energy for photosynthesis and lowering heat exchange under the foliage coma et al 2016 the choice of the types of plants has also an influence on cooling performances monteiro et al 2017 peri et al 2016 zhao et al 2014 with plants like salvia and stachys to be preferred to succulent plants for summertime environmental cooling and substrate insulation monteiro et al 2017 finally soil and vegetation create cooling effects through evapotranspiration berardi et al 2014 and the vegetation acts on the albedo of the roof increasing it from values of 0 1 0 2 typical of bitumen tar and gravel roofs to values ranging from 0 7 to 0 85 saadatian et al 2013 green roofs reflect about 20 30 of solar radiation and absorb about 60 of heat in photosynthesis with only 20 transmitted to the growing medium below thereby they reduce heat flow by 70 90 in summer and about 10 30 in winter depending on the climate zone berardi et al 2014 section s1 of the supporting information si file reports a series of studies about the temperature reduction effect of green roofs in different geographical locations the studies suggest as a first approximation that green roofs can lower indoor air temperatures by 1 5 c to 3 c depending on the external climate conditions and physical composition of the green roof relative to flat conventional roofs and that this effect can be amplified when combined with ventilation measures during the night as further illustrated in section 3 1 this value was assumed in the present simulation model as basis to support the air temperature mitigation potential of green roofs 3 materials and methods 3 1 case study urban heat mortality impacts reduction through nbs the msm proposed here looks at the impact of temperature in the city on local mortality during heatwave episodes the model focuses on a number of elderly citizens in a city area and aims at simulating how they are affected by heatwaves in terms of the likelihood of mortality the simulation utilises a ceteris paribus modelling approach meaning that the relationship of the observed phenomenon mortality induced by heatwaves with other possible influencing factors e g level of sport and physical activities practiced by people are not taken into account modelling approaches based on ceteris paribus are commonly utilized in economics to assert economic impacts of policies bierens and swanson 2000 the adoption of this approach in this study inevitably implies a simplification of the behavioural mechanism simulated to identify vulnerabilities that increase or decrease the likelihood of heatwave mortality however this simplification is necessary in order to keep the model manageable and to not incur into the risk of obtaining results that because of the effect of an over detailed representation over parametrisation without the possibility of a proper calibration of the many parameters involved in the end would not properly reflect the reality because the model would have a low generalization capacity sun et al 2016 for this reason complicated individual based simulation models with many parameters have been criticized rand and rust 2011 the microsimulation model was implemented in the very popular netlogo 2 2 https ccl northwestern edu netlogo software version 6 0 4 fig 1 shows a screenshot of the interface built in netlogo 3 2 city selection and data mapping the nature4cities project covered four cities szeged alcalá de henares metropolitan city of milan and çankaya municipality and for each of them a simulation was run based on cityspecific data both population data and land use data were used to allocate numbers of elderly 65 people to areas in the city with buildings both datasets were obtained from the urban atlas 2012 dataset from the eu copernicus programme 3 3 https land copernicus eu local urban atlas urban atlas 2012 this had the advantage to run simulations consistently across cities as these used exactly the same input data that are harmonized to a similar quality standard the dataset provided 29 types of land use in geographic information system gis for 800 functional urban areas fua in the eea39 countries which includes the above mentioned four project cities municipalities 4 4 https www nature4cities eu blog categories pilot cities and sites european space agency 2016 the eu copernicus programme provided also population distributions for 2012 including age groupings which were linked to the spatial data in the absence of building data indicating the elderly population distribution within the city the population was allocated randomly to areas with land use urban fabric as per the urban atlas 2012 dataset population values were obtained by copernicus developers through down scaling census data from country and city censuses to polygons in the copernicus fua datasets the simulations were initialised with a representative sample of the elderly population estimated at 1 of the total elderly population to enable the models to operate in a parsimonious manner 3 3 temperature scenarios temperature scenarios can be inserted in the simulation to analyse impacts of current and future climate temperature were thereby incorporated exogenously into the model the surface air temperature and humidity data recorded in 2016 by the closest local weather stations located within or close to the studied cities were used to simulate the past past data were available up to 2018 but only data from 2016 were used because this was the only year with complete data sets no missing values for all the four cities in addition temperature for climate change projections up to 2100 was used the temperature projections for the years 2030 2050 2070 and 2090 were based on ipcc rcp8 5 climate scenario set with country and regional data developed in the coupled model intercomparison project 5 5 https pcmdi llnl gov mips cmip5 cmip5 these are based on an ensemble of climate models for each of the four representative concentration pathways rcps scenarios globally agreed by climate modellers as summarised in table 1 ipcc 2013 average temperature maximum and minimum temperatures number of summer days 25 c number of hot days 35 c number of very hot days 45 c and number of tropical nights 20 c are available per country and per month the variance calculated with the data from 2016 was superimposed to the monthly average temperatures obtained from ipcc scenarios so to generate a dataset with daily variability in the absence of future climate change projections that have a daily interval for the sake of simplicity it was assumed that the outdoor temperature for the data series is similar across the city the simulated temperature was subsequently translated into an indoor air temperature directly as a simplifying assumption in case of presence of green roofs based on the reviewed literature it was assumed that an indoor temperature reduction between 1 5 c and 3 c is possible see section 2 3 as compared to the case without a green roof given the uncertainty within this range caused amongst other factors by the variation in climate conditions and green roof type the specific temperature reduction within this range can be set by the model user thereby the simulation allows for exploring the impact of different green roofs from very effective to moderately effective the relationships as established from the literature were translated into a set of model functions first the outdoor temperature datasets were established location specific datasets for ground station based air temperature and dew point evolution over time are loaded as inputs with variations per hour for temperature and per month for dew point 3 4 model setup a total of 360 model runs were made for each city first a no heatwave baseline model where the mortality effects from heatwaves were turned off was run for comparative purposes as a second step the outdoor air temperature was made vary between five simulated temperature years 2016 2030 2050 2070 and 2090 third for each of these years with heatwave effects seven variants were simulated without green roofs with 30 60 and 100 of the existing houses occupied by elderly population covered by green roofs in an hypothetical scenario without accounting for any exclusion due to possible constraints or restrictions to the green roofs installation and with 1 5 and 3 degree temperature reduction impact due to green roofs finally each of these different models was run 10 times to obtain a min max range and average value to establish a distribution of the variation 3 5 agents selection elderly background mortality the population analysed in the simulation comprised elderly people aged 65 as a single category the reason for selecting this range is data availability given that urban atlas data only specified age groups from 0 to 14 0 to 64 years and 64 years of age background mortality rates were analysed for each city from the statistical office data to understand the non heatwave related rate of deaths for citizens aged 65 or older number of deaths of elderly people above the age of 65 per year dt were divided by elderly population numbers p to obtain a probability of death per year and translated to a daily mortality rate m d by dividing by the number of days in a year eq 1 1 m d d t p 365 to simulate the background mortality of elderly people in each 24 hour period and for each agent a probability roll was made between 0 and 1 if the roll was falling above the mortality rate per day the agent was removed from the simulation as if mortality had occurred this is to be interpreted as a transition probability that determines the switch of an agent from one state alive to the other dead 3 6 heatwave mortality impacts the impact of heatwaves was based on baccini m et al 2008 which established a combined measure of temperature and dew point as a proxy for humidity and related it to heat mortality risk in 15 european cities the study was selected because of three reasons 1 firstly the widespread coverage across 15 cities in europe including athens barcelona budapest dublin helsinki ljubljana london milan paris prague rome stockholm turin valencia and zurich these covered three out of the four countries used as case studies in the nature4cities project and also values for north continental and mediterranean cities that could be used for the country of the missing city 2 secondly the inclusion of temperature and humidity effects by a measure of apparent temperature at 3 thirdly the split of results into different age group types 15 64 65 74 and 75 years the formula used to calculate at in celsius degrees is defined in baccini m et al 2008 as shown in eq 2 2 a t 2 653 0 994 t 0 0153 w 2 where t outdoor dry bulb air temperature c w dew point c the value of at calculated by eq 2 was compared with the threshold values summarised in table 2 derived from baccini et al 2008 above which increased mortality occurred the threshold mortality values used in the simulation are across all age groups change all in table 2 as indicated in the table in absence of results provided by baccini m et al 2008 for specific cities for the 65 74 and 75 years age ranges as also indicated in the table in the simulation for each day when at was above the threshold in the city the mortality percent increase ratio was applied as per table 2 this simulated the compound effect of heatwave impacts on mortality including and excluding the possible installation of green roofs 3 7 model flow the flowchart presented in fig 2 describes the sequence of the steps performed in the model 1 for each city we calculate the average per month and across age ranges daily background mortality rates bmr of elderly people using eq 1 the values obtained are reported in table 3 note that the values change monthly only for one city alcalá de henares due to the lack of available monthly mortality data for the other three cities 2 for each of the four studied cities we use the daily values of t and w recorded in 2016 to calculate the at for that year 3 as described in section 3 3 by superimposing the variance calculated from the 2016 data to the future values of monthly temperatures derived from the ipcc rcp8 5 scenario we generate daily values of t for future years and store them in cvs files note that the ipcc rcp8 5 scenarios do not cover future values for w therefore they could not be incorporated and historic values were retained 4 we use these values of t and w to calculate future years daily values of at using eq 2 5 using the values contained in table 2 and the predicted at values for future years calculated at step 4 we calculate for each city the average daily percentage mortality increase pmi during heatwave events to apply for each celsius degree above the threshold value of at 6 for each agent we modify the variable city mortality rates cmr as indicated in fig 2 where heatwave is a binary variable which takes value 1 if at is higher than the threshold temperature value indicated in table 2 for the city where the agent is located i e if the threshold exceedance te is greater than zero and the value 0 otherwise gr is a binary variable which takes the value 0 if on the building where the agent is located there is a traditional roof and the value 1 if a green roof is installed on it 7 for each agent and each month a value between 0 and 1 is extracted from a uniform probability distribution and if the value is above cmr then the agent is removed from the simulation thus simulating its death and the counter for the number of deaths nd is increased by one unit 4 results this section summarises the results of the simulations for the four cities and eight different scenarios from 2016 to 2090 based on variations in green roofs coverage and impact range from 1 5 c to 3 c temperature reduction due to the presence of green roofs the black squares in figs 3 6 represent the number of annual mortality cases values to be read in the left vertical axis while the whiskers indicate the upper and lower values of the mortality the blue circles whose values have to be read in the right vertical axis represent the additional number of mortality cases with respect to the background mortality i e with respect to the number of mortality cases that would occur amongst elderly people even in the absence of heatwave events 4 1 results for szeged hungary the simulation area was selected to cover the centre of szeged with surrounding areas and satellite peri urban areas figure s1 a total of 1600 elderly citizens were simulated in the model runs using the procedure described in section 3 5 the background mortality impact in 2016 for szeged was estimated at 73 mortalities which is close to 5 of the elderly population the threshold value of the apparent temperature after which heatwave mortality occurs was set to 22 8 c value for budapest in table 2 the effect of a simulated heatwave in 2016 is to increase the mortality to 122 per year which is above 8 of the elderly population above 65 of age see table s1 the results suggest that green roofs can if rolled out across all buildings with elderly people reduce heatwave mortality by over 80 in case of a 3 c indoor temperature reduction in comparison a 1 5 c indoor temperature reduction results in over 50 reduction in heatwave induced deaths the heatwave mortality reduction effect for 2090 in szeged is still high despite growing outdoor air temperatures table 4 shows the percent variations in heatwave mortality cases induced by the different future temperature scenarios with respect to the case of absence of green roofs 0 green roofs coverage the values have been calculated by subtracting the background mortality cases i e the ones that occur with no heatwave from the total number of mortality cases so to make sure that only mortality due to heatwave is taken into account the negative value slight increase of heatwave mortality cases in 2030 for the case of 30 green roof coverage and 1 5 c impact is due to the fact that average 2030 temperature in the ipcc future climate scenarios for hungary are arguably lower than the 2016 temperature levels from the results of the simulations one can infer that the reduced indoor temperatures caused by the presence of green roofs are insufficient to fully mitigate the effects of growing temperatures across the century due to climate change but still can reduce the impact by half in case of 3 c indoor temperature reductions see table 4 table s1 and fig 3 4 2 results for alcalá de henares spain the simulation area was selected to include the city centre of alcalá de henares with surrounding areas and satellite peri urban areas figure s2 the whole area includes the edible forest nbs use case proposed as a green space in the nature4cities project nature4cities 2019 the same area was used across all the three simulations whose results are summarised in table 5 a total of 2900 citizens were simulated in the model runs in this case the methodology described in section 3 5 estimated the background mortality for 2016 as 117 mortalities during the year or at 6 of the elderly population the threshold value of the apparent temperature was set in this case to 22 4 c value for barcelona in table 2 the impact of a simulated heatwave in 2016 increases the mortality to 284 per year or close to 15 of the elderly population above 65 years of age see table s2 in this year if rolled out across all buildings with elderly people green roofs can reduce heatwave mortality by 67 if we assume they are able to cause a 3 c indoor temperature reduction a 1 5 c indoor temperature reduction results instead in almost 44 reduction in heatwave mortality cases still when achieved across all buildings the heatwave mortality reduction impact for future years in alcalá de henares remains relevant although it is progressively reduced year after year due to rapidly increasing outdoor temperatures table 5 shows the percent variations in heatwave mortality cases induced by the different scenarios with respect to the case of absence of green roofs 0 green roofs coverage the mortality cases reduce in 2030 and 2050 because the temperature datasets for spain exhibit cooler temperatures in those decades then today based on the ipcc average temperature forecasts by reducing indoor temperatures by 3 c green roofs can then provide substantial mortality reductions consistently bringing mortality cases to less than half for the 21st century and close to zero for the first half of the century see table 5 table s2 and fig 4 4 3 results for the metropolitan city of milan italy the simulation area was based on a portion of the north of the milan metropolitan area cantered on the quarry restoration site in parco nord about 15 km north of milan city centre selected with surrounding neighbourhoods figure s3 a total of 5600 citizens were simulated in the model runs the background mortality impact for the metropolitan city of milan is estimated again using the method described in section 3 5 for 2016 at 227 mortalities during the year or 4 of the elderly population 65 the threshold value of the apparent temperature was set in this case to 31 8 c see table 2 the impact of a simulated heatwave in 2016 only negligibly increases the mortality to 228 per year see table s3 in 2016 even if green roofs are rolled out across all the buildings with elderly people they do not have a beneficial effect on heatwave induced mortality reduction even in the hypothesis of a 3 c indoor temperature reduction capacity this is also the case for future temperatures in some cases see table 6 table s3 and fig 5 there are two reasons why the heatwaves in the simulation do not have a relevant mortality impact first due to a very high temperature threshold found in the literature at which mortality starts to increase as such increasing temperatures do not have increasing mortality effects and thereby green roofs do not reduce such mortalities as they do not occur even in the case of no green roofs roll out second because the average monthly ipcc cmip5 scenarios for italy do not result in any future year 2030 2050 2070 2090 in temperatures above the high threshold therefore running the scenarios never results in any heatwave impacts in the first place as such model runs with green roofs are similar in impact on mortality to model runs without green roofs and thereby the model gives what appears to be a counterintuitive result if green roofs are present the number of mortalities increases even with respect to the case of no heatwave this is reflected in the negative values of the percentage variations in heatwave mortality cases induced by the different scenarios with respect to the case of absence of green roofs 0 green roofs coverage shown in table 6 this can largely be explained by the effect of randomness in absence of a significant change in future temperature in the ipcc cmip5 scenarios combined with a lack of a green roof effect since the number of model runs is quite limited 10 runs for each scenario to keep computational time reasonable there is a possibility that in absence of strong effects the mortality is higher in one given set of 10 model runs on average versus another set of 10 model runs as mentioned 360 model runs were carried out in total for a city based on scenario settings including the variation in green roof temperature impact share of people living under a green roof and temperature years 2016 2030 2050 2070 2090 for the case of 2050 as the mean number of mortality cases with no heatwave coincides with the number of mortality case in the scenario of 0 green roofs roll out 227 cases the baseline for calculation is zero cases therefore a percentage variation makes no sense division by zero in this case we have therefore reported directly the number of reduced mortality cases to make a distinction with the other values in the table which are percentage values the entries of the column referred to the year 2050 are reported in brackets negative values indicate an increase instead of a reduction of the number of mortality cases in the scenario for 2090 green roofs start again to have a positive effect on the reduction of heatwave mortality cases in every percentage of coverage of the roofs of the studied area and in both the indoor temperature reduction capacity hypotheses 1 5 c and 3 c however also this is an effect of the randomised impact of mortality and not due to green roofs given the high temperature mortality threshold and cmip5 temperatures remaining below this threshold in all scenarios 4 4 results for çankaya municipality turkey the simulation area was based on the south east portion of ankara where çankaya municipality is located figure s4 a total of 3000 citizens were simulated in the model runs the background mortality impact was estimated with the same methodology as for the other cases it resulted for 2016 in 119 mortalities during the year or close to 4 of the elderly population 65 the threshold value of the apparent temperature was set in this case to 29 4 c the value referring to mediterranean region in table 2 the impact of a simulated heatwave in 2016 increases the mortality to 147 cases per year or about 5 0 of the elderly population see table s4 green roofs in 2016 across all buildings with elderly people have a negligible result on heatwave induced mortality reduction both in the case of a 1 5 c and 3 c indoor hypothetic temperature reduction capacity the reason is that the heatwave impact is limited in 2016 based on temperature estimates for that year the heatwave mortality reduction impact for future years in çankaya municipality becomes increasingly prominent as the temperature increases across the century as such the reduced indoor temperatures can substantially mitigate the effects of growing temperatures across the century due to climate change reducing heatwave induced mortality up to 75 especially in case of 3 c indoor temperature reductions see table 7 table s4 and fig 6 5 conclusion the paper shows an application of a microsimulation model to simulate the urban heatwave induced mortality reduction as a consequence of potential roll out of green roofs across four different cities in europe szeged in hungary alcalá de henares in spain çankaya municipality in turkey and the metropolitan city of milan in italy without such a simulation one could gain insights based on background literature on the degree of the mortality effect in terms of proportion of the affected population but would miss a number of relevant key areas for decision making the simulation helps to localize the results to a city and particular scenarios therein and provides additional insights such as on future temperature scenarios under climate change and on how green roofs can assist with mortality reduction not only today but also under future climate conditions as the effect of global warming furthermore the simulation allows to easily gain insights in a plug and play manner on the benchmark temperature reduction that is needed for a particular city to have a maximum desired impact such as 1 5 c or 3 c indoor temperature reduction as simulated in this paper the results of the simulations showed substantial variation of the impacts of green roof installation on heatwave induced mortality cases across cities in the case of szeged alcalá de henares and çankaya municipality a substantial reduction in heatwave induced mortality was found to occur for the present time and even more for future years 2030 2050 2070 2090 especially as the average outdoor temperatures become higher across the 21st century in the case of the metropolitan city of milan the results have to be taken with more caution in this case green roofs showed low or any mitigation impact in certain cases because heatwaves had little additional mortality effects in the simulations in the first place the underlying factor is the temperature threshold above which heatwave mortality occurs which was inferred from the literature to be substantial higher in the metropolitan city of milan 31 8 c than in other cities further investigation of the temperature mortality relationship would be needed to shed more light on the wide range of differences between cities but nonetheless the results encourage in considering green roofs as a temperature mitigation technology for climate resilient cities taking into account city demographics and ageing populations during the 21st century this can help to support the design of nbs that have a temperature mitigation impact especially for property managers that focus on vulnerable elderly populations contributing to the identification of key importance aspects that shall be taken into account in the implementation models of nbs to address climate change related effects 6 discussion 6 1 limitations of the model the model provides insights on the effect of heatwaves on mortality under current and future temperatures specified per city and according to different scenarios of green roofs implementation in its current form the model has some limitations we will not discuss here the limitations that are intrinsic in the model building that are due to the simplifications we induce in the representation of real phenomena because they pertain to every model to some extent and they have been partly discussed in section 3 1 here we will briefly enumerate the limitations due to the input data of the model firstly it uses outdoor air temperature measurements based on a single weather station within the city and extrapolates that across the entire simulated city area therefore the results are not representative of particular locations and can only be interpreted at the aggregated level of the simulated area city block or building specific models can be built but they would require an understanding of how the make up of a locality in terms of building types and built area influence localised temperatures as well as data to enable an accurate up to date localised representation of said built area they would require a larger number of temperature point measurements across the area especially if this latter spans over several kilometres to partially overcome some of these limitations the model could be improved considering uhi effects based on accurate spatial distributions of temperature across the city several approaches have been used in the literature to derive such distributions some of them start from real measurements of air temperature with weather stations and apply nonlinear models to forecast temperature over time and map them across space but without using urban morphological factors or heat balance equations cellura et al 2011 other approaches use remote sensing images coupled with ground truth data of urban albedo and heat flux models bonafoni et al 2017 wang et al 2019 or machine learning models oh et al 2020 to estimate albedo and land surface temperature variations across time and space many approaches are based on extensive measurements across the city romero rodríguez et al 2020 while bueno et al 2013 calculate urban air temperature and humidity values using weather data measured outside the city and solving heat transfer equations and litardo et al 2020 apply the model described in bueno et al 2013 after performing a k means clustering to distinguish different homogeneous types of urban morphologies however we need to underline that applying these sophisticated models would have been out of the scope of this paper moreover one could have fully taken advantage of the increased accuracy obtained with such detailed uhi estimation models only if this could be also coupled on the other side with a higher accuracy in the distribution of vulnerable people in the buildings which is instead done randomly in this paper because of lack of data secondly the future temperature scenarios are based on a monthly average increase or decrease estimates over future years the estimated values have been superimposed on variability in the present for this reason expected increasing future variability in temperature e g extremely high and low temperatures during the year is not accounted for this superimposition approach was selected as current climate change models cannot provide valid local future fluctuations in temperature but only reasonable estimates from country to regional level long term trends ipcc 2013 however since mortality depends on reaching threshold temperatures the variability between days within a month can increase or decrease which can dampen or exacerbate the future impact as there may be more or less extreme temperature variations within a single month to incorporate this variability climate change models would need to provide valid daily variations which is currently not feasible thirdly the outdoor temperatures were assumed to be representative of indoor temperatures as a substantial simplification since understanding the impact of different building construction types on temperature gradients from outdoor to indoor was outside of the scope of the model study for a realistic impact assessment such effects would need to be considered as some buildings will worsen and others reduce the temperature effects across the day and at night this reinforces the earlier consideration that results cannot be interpreted on a location specific basis in the current state of the model but can be interpreted only based on a macro level effect fourthly the impact of short term weather patterns on mortality has not been incorporated in the model rules in the literature a stronger mortality impact has been hypothesised of a cumulative number of hot days and or hot nights following each other compared to a scattered number of hot days and hot nights across a period when controlling for time lags and cooler control days several studies have looked at this effect of temporal stratification of weather including evaluations of hot days hot nights cool days cool nights and control days ho et al 2017 murage et al 2017 xu and tong 2017 since the results in these studies are not uniform more analysis is needed to ascertain why there are substantial differences in the evaluated impacts in order to be able to establish valid model rules for example xu and tong 2017 found that heatwaves with extremely hot days followed by not extremely hot nights results in mortality increases in 2 out of the 3 studied cities without a clear explanation of this lack of uniformity finally the relationship between apparent temperature and mortality was taken as established from a literature study baccini m et al 2008 p 716 which found substantial heterogeneity between cities in terms of threshold temperatures at which mortality begins to occur and also in the effect per each celsius degree of temperature above the threshold the rationale for this heterogeneity is not known at any level of precision and the relationship between heat and health risk is still a studied matter cheng et al 2019 various reasons can cause this variation vargo et al 2016 including socio demographic gronlund 2014 li et al 2019 behavioural and health related ones due to pre existing conditions medina ramón and schwartz 2007 vandentorren et al 2006 and the existing ability of buildings to provide cooler indoor spaces especially if equipped with air conditioning barreca et al 2016 farbotko and waitt 2011 or to exacerbate higher temperatures from outdoor to indoor see guo et al 2017 and references therein several of these relationships prompt the potential for expansion of the model to take into account both static and interactive effects related to health and care settings such as bed confinement and availability of care to support social activities showering ingestion of liquids and opening of windows as behaviours shown to reduce heatwave mortality vandentorren et al 2006 for a better understanding heat augmenting or reducing impacts as well as mortality would need to be studied relative to temperature variations on a longitudinal basis in any case the lack of information about the distribution of vulnerable people such as elderly of 65 years of age and people with mental or physical health conditions within each building as well as area by area prevented a better precision of the model in this respect one needs to specify that the beneficial effect of green roofs in terms of temperature reductions can be felt only by the occupants of the last floor and partially of the second to last floor at best but since the distribution of the vulnerable dwellers in the buildings is not known it is not possible to estimate what percentage of the vulnerable population would be positively affected by the presence of green roofs what is interesting to remark is however that the people living in the last floors of the buildings are the ones who suffer the most the effects of heatwaves because of the additional heat slowly released by the ceiling owing to its thermal inertia which becomes very hot across the day due to direct solar irradiation therefore if vulnerable people live in the last floors their vulnerability results increased in our model we assume that if the green roof allows keeping the apparent temperature below the alarm threshold that would cause an increase in heatwave related deaths as individuated in the cited study by baccini et al 2008 it saves the life of an agent which is supposed to live in the last floor of a building in the scope of this paper we do not make use of population density data inside the city in fact our maps only show the locations of the buildings and not the population density in the areas where the buildings are located if these other pieces of information were incorporated in the model more targeted infrastructure options could be evaluated for more effective mitigation options 6 2 applicability of green roofs as a climate change adaptation solution in order to get a feedback about the potential of the model from one side and the applicability of the green roofs as a climate change adaptation solution on the other side a meeting with the policymakers from the four partners cities involved in the nature4cities project was organized to showcase the scenarios described in the paper after the presentation the policymakers were interviewed about the following aspects 1 impressions first glace impression about the model is it understandable can they relate to it 2 usefulness how the model could be of help and for which specific problems it may be particularly useful in the city planning context 3 timing at which stage of the planning and decision making process the presented simulation models could possibly be useful 4 limitations the challenges the interviewee sees with using the results that impose a limitation on the usefulness 5 recommendations the kind of adjustments and improvements needed to increase its usability the model was evaluated positively because it shows that green roofs have a substantial impact on reducing heat in buildings except than in the case of milan which in effect reduce the chances of heatwave mortality the scenario thereby illustrates a solid relationship between heat health and nbs this could be used to create more support for nbs and to ensure that investments e g finances human resources are well spent one interviewee mentioned that green roofs are not considered as a viable option but only when a scenario in which census data and heat island effect are combined to identify pocket areas where interventions are urgently needed the municipality might take this option under consideration despite the positive feedback the interviewees were generally hesitant to consider green roofs as a suitable nbs intervention within their context the main reasons are i green roofs are expensive and therefore not easily affordable in residential buildings which are not public but in private ownership this aspect has indeed already been investigated in other studies blackhurst et al 2010 concluding that green roofs are not cost effective on a private basis but they become more competitive on multifamily and commercial buildings when social attenuation of the uhi greenhouse gases emissions reduction and storm water runoff reduction and aesthetic benefits are also taken into account in more mature markets the payback time of green roofs becomes lower than their lifetime thus encouraging to a larger scale implementation which will considerably increase their social benefits feng and hewage 2018 ii some buildings have monumental or architectural status or the roofs are too steep and thus not suitable for greening iii in some cases there is a lack of expertise to create green roofs nevertheless the model set up offering the quantifiable results makes it usable and interesting for further

24727,the growth of yellowfin tuna has been the subject of considerable research efforts since the early 1960s most studies support a complex two stanza growth pattern with a sharp acceleration departing from the von bertalanffy growth curve used for most fish populations this growth pattern has been assumed to result from a combination of physiological ecological and behavioral factors but the role and contribution of each of them have not been addressed yet we developed a bioenergetic model for yellowfin tuna in the context of dynamic energy budget theory to mechanistically represent the processes governing yellowfin tuna growth most parameters of the model were inferred from pacific bluefin tuna using body size scaling relationships while some essential parameters were estimated from biological data sets collected in the indian ocean the model proved particularly suitable for reproducing the data collected during the pacific yellowfin tuna farming experience conducted by the inter american tropical tuna commission at the achotines laboratory in panama in addition model predictions appeared in agreement with knowledge of the biology and ecology of wild yellowfin tuna we used our model to explore through simulations two major assumptions that might explain the existence of growth stanzas observed in wild yellowfin tuna i a lower food supply during juvenile stage in relation with high intra and inter species competition and ii ontogenetic changes in food diet our results show that both assumptions are plausible although none of them is self sufficient to explain the intensity of growth acceleration observed in wild indian ocean yellowfin tuna suggesting that the two factors may act in concert our study shows that the yellowfin growth pattern is likely due to behavioral changes triggered by the acquisition of physiological abilities and anatomical traits through ontogeny that result in a major change in intensity of schooling and in a shift in the biotic habitat and trophic ecology of this commercially important tuna species keywords deb theory body size scaling behavioral changes ontogeny 1 introduction yellowfin tuna thunnus albacares yft is an epipelagic species widely distributed in the tropical and subtropical waters of the world s major oceans pecoraro et al 2017 owing to its high value as food source yft supports important commercial and recreational fisheries with an annual global catch of about 1 3 million tonnes in the last decade it ranks among the world s ten most harvested marine species fao 2018 at global scale yft has recently been assessed as near threatened following the red list criteria of the international union for conservation of nature collette et al 2001 while the assessments of the status of its four oceanic stocks conducted within the tuna regional fisheries management organizations indicate that overfishing currently occurs in the indian ocean iotc 2018 for assessment and management purpose growth of wild yft has been the subject of considerable research efforts since the 1960s through analysis of mark recapture data size frequency distribution of commercial fishery catches and ageing from calcified and bony structures diaz 1963 schaefer et al 1961 wild and foreman 1980 yft growth varies between ocean basins and regions and shows in some areas some complex pattern that departs from the traditional von bertalanffy growth curve used for most fish stocks pecoraro et al 2017 in particular some growth studies conducted in the atlantic indian and western central pacific oceans support a two stanza growth pattern with a sharp acceleration in growth rate at about 60 65 cm fork length dortel et al 2015 eveson et al 2015 gascuel et al 1992 lehodey and leroy 1999 the complex growth pattern observed in some populations of yft has been assumed to result from a combination of physiological ecological and behavioral factors but the role and contribution of each of them have not been addressed yet bard 1984 dortel et al 2015 fonteneau 1980 gaertner and pagavino 1992 a better understanding of these mechanisms is essential to assess the plasticity of yft growth and eventually strengthen the scientific advice on the stock status and improve the overall quality of current stock assessments we investigated the factors governing the growth of yft with a bioenergetic model that covers the different post metamorphic life stages of the indian ocean yft within the framework of the dynamic energy budget deb theory kooijman 2010 deb theory has already proven successful to study growth and reproduction of a large range of marine taxa freitas et al 2010 pecquerie et al 2009 sousa tia et al 2008 van der veer et al 2006 and more recently to study the dynamics of populations and ecosystems maury 2017 maury and poggiale 2013 pethybridge et al 2013 other bioenergetic approaches are available but they are generally specific to a particular life stage and unsuitable for modelling the changes between distinct life stages hansen et al 1993 ney 1993 in contrast the deb theory provides a powerful conceptual framework to describe the lifelong growth in relation to other physiological requirements such as metabolism and body internal maintenance development and reproduction as a function of environmental food conditions and organism state freitas et al 2010 kooijman 2010 2 materials and methods 2 1 data sources we collected data sets from the literature for both wild and farmed yft to compare the outputs of the bioenergetic model with morphometric ageing and reproduction observations 2 1 1 wild indian ocean yellowfin tuna for wild yft we considered a length at age data set collected throughout the regional tuna tagging project rttp a large scale mark recapture program conducted in the western indian ocean between 2005 2007 and the west sumatra tuna tagging project wsttp a tagging program conducted off the western indonesian coast in august 2007 anonymous 2008 murua et al 2015 all lengths were measured with a measuring board to the nearest 0 1 cm in fork length lf i e the projected straight distance measured from the tip of the upper jaw to the shortest caudal ray fish ages were estimated from readings of saggital otoliths collected from i 128 yft caught through the rttp and measuring between 43 72 cm lf at tagging and 47 9 135 4 cm lf at recapture ii 18 fish caught through the wsttp measuring between 19 29 cm lf iii 35 fish including 7 females collected from 2008 to 2009 at the indian ocean tuna ltd cannery and measuring between 31 147 5 cm lf morize et al 2008 sardenne et al 2015 otoliths were prepared for age analysis and read at the laboratoire de sclérochronologie des animaux aquatiques brest france following the method described by stéquert 1995 the number of otolith growth increments was counted repeatedly for different otolith sections morize et al 2008 sardenne et al 2015 the ages were estimated from these counts using an ageing error model that explicitly accounts for process and interpretation errors in otolith readings dortel et al 2013 we also considered length weight measurements from defrosted yft caught in the whole indian ocean basin fork length was measured with a caliper to the nearest 0 1 cm and total weight was measured with a scale to the nearest 0 1 kg bodin et al 2018 the data set included i 5089 fish from the indian ocean tuna ltd cannery caught during 2005 2012 66 165 cm lf 5 8 87 5 kg and ii 100 additional fish collected in 2010 2013 of which 35 females 54 7 148 2 cm lf 3 4 61 5 kg and 65 individuals whose sex was indeterminate 29 61 cm lf 0 4 4 1 kg finally we used a data set of batch fecundity i e number of eggs released per batch derived from gravimetric method applied to 40 yft females in the size range 79 146 9 cm lf that were collected on board commercial purse seiners in the western indian ocean during 2009 2010 zudaire et al 2013 the batch fecundity varied from 0 32 million to 6 91 million eggs with a mean of 3 07 million eggs 2 1 2 farmed pacific yellowfin tuna we used data from yft farming experiment conducted by the inter american tropical tuna commission iattc in achotines laboratory in the republic of panama wexler et al 2003 this experiment lasted over 3 years and involved 55 yft 53 females 46 males caught in the coastal waters of the northwest panama bight in 1996 and 1998 and then transferred in a broodstock yft tank the tank was filled with seawater and semi open to ocean thus the temperature and salinity in tank were influenced by the seasonal fluctuations in ocean upwelling and rainfall during the experiment daily temperatures in tank ranged from 20 1 to 29 7 c with an average of 27 5 c yft were fed once per day with one of five prey species whose caloric values were calculated based on metabolizable energy values of protein 17 7 kj g 1 and lipid 33 5 kj g 1 the length and wet weight of fish were measured at the time of the transfer in the tank and at their death the food daily rations fdr body wet weight day are also available from the literature wexler et al 2003 they were calculated as the ratio between the wet weight of ingested food and the wet weight of an individual at each time step t of the simulation i e 1 day a food conversion ratio fcr was estimated as the ratio between the wet weight of ingested food on increasing biomass over given times intervals of 12 103 days for a constant number of yft 2 2 description of the yellowfin tuna deb model 2 2 1 state variables and dynamics the yellowfin tuna life cycle includes five different stages embryo larva early juvenile juvenile and adult in this study we implemented a bioenergetic model based on deb theory kooijman 2010 that only describes three life stages of yft early juvenile juvenile and adult this model was focused on an individual fish defined by four state variables reserve e in j structural length lv in cm maturation eh in j and reproduction er in j instead of the dynamics of the reserve e we followed the dynamics of the scaled reserve density e which is driven by the dynamics of e the scaled reserve density e e e m is a dimensionless quantity where e e l v 3 is the reserve density and em represents the maximum reserve density the four state variables and the parameters used are described in table 2 the dynamics of the state variables fig 1 are controlled by various energy fluxes varying with size and body temperature table 3 the energy derived from ingested food is directly assimilated into the reserve p a from there the energy is mobilized according to the κ rule a constant fraction κ is allocated to somatic maintenance p s and growth p g with priority for somatic maintenance the rest is allocated to maturity maintenance p j and maturation or reproduction in adults p r with priority for maturity maintenance maturation explicitly refers to the fish development and the transitions from one stage to another occur for defined maturity thresholds e h e from early juvenile to juvenile and e h p from juvenile to fully developed adult the beginning of the juvenile stage is marked by the acquisition of thermoconservation ability a notable property of most tuna species compared to other fish species brill 1994 from about 20 cm lf yft is able to raise the temperature in some parts of its body above the seawater temperature by the storage of the metabolic heat through vascular heat exchanger systems shadwick et al 2013 wexler et al 2011 we assumed that the thermoconservation ability of yft involved energetic costs proportional to the square of structural length the initiation of the thermoconservation ability occurs as a point in time once eh reaches e h e eq d2 in table 2 this assumption slightly simplifies the model compared to the deb based model developed for the pacific bluefin tuna thunnus orientalis which considered a gradual increase of the energetic costs associated with regional endothermy jusup et al 2011 once at the adult stage the maturity level does not increase any further and the fish stores energy in a reproduction buffer throughout the year during a spawning season the energy stored in the reproduction buffer is converted to eggs according to species specific handling rules two spawning seasons are observed a main season from november to march and a second minor period in june july stéquert et al 2001 zudaire et al 2013 as observed for pacific yft we considered that spawning is triggered when water temperature reaches 24 c and ends above 28 c itano 2000 margulies et al 2007 spawning was considered to occur almost daily from december march and june july and for seawater temperatures between 24 c and 28 c when the reproduction buffer contains sufficient energy to produce a batch consistent with the multiple batch spawning behaviour of yft the energy stored in reproduction buffer is released through several batches with an increasing energy requirement per batch as fish grows the energy required to produce one batch eb in j includes the energy content of eggs and energy losses to convert the energy of reproduction buffer into yolk material 1 e b e b l v 3 κ r where eb is the energy density of one batch j cm 3 the number of eggs released per batch nb can be estimated from the energy requirement per batch and the energy content of one egg e 0 following 2 n b e b e 0 where e 0 was estimated to have a mean value of 1 295 j based on the mean dry weight of an egg of captive yellowfin about 0 043 mg margulies et al 2007 and the lipid contents of the eggs of wild atlantic bluefin tuna thunnus thynnus and bonito sarda sarda estimated to be 7 953 j mg 1 i e 26 4 of the total caloric value of a freshly spawned egg or approximately 20 of its dry mass ortega and mourente 2010 2 2 2 forcing variables consistent with deb theory two forcing variables were considered the body temperature t k and the food density x j m 3 body temperature affects all the metabolic fluxes including the maximum assimilation p a m the somatic maintenance rates p m and p t as well as v and k j the values of those rates fluctuate within a species specific tolerance range as described by the arrhenius relationship let k t the value of a metabolic rate k at any temperature t k ta the species specific arrhenius temperature k and t 1 a chosen reference temperature k 3 k t k t 1 exp t a t 1 t a t the food density is converted into ingestion according to a holling type ii scaled functional response a dimensionless quantity defined as 4 f x x x k xk the half saturation constant is the food density for which the ingestion rate is half its maximum value kooijman 2010 2 2 3 link between state variables and fishery observations the deb state variables cannot be measured directly only indirectly with additional assumptions to relate these state variables with the observations such as length weight and fecundity the structural length lv is related to the physical length expressed in fork length lf cm using the species specific shape coefficient δj 5 l f l v δ j the wet weight ww g has contributions from structure wv reserve we and also from reproduction buffer for adults w e r and it expresses as follows 6 w w w v w e w e r d v l v 3 e e r ρ e where dv is the density of the structural volume g cm 3 and ρe is the energy content per gram of reserve or reproduction buffer we also define the reproductive investment ir as the ratio between the weight of reproduction buffer and the wet weight of fish this latter provides information on the weight losses due to the spawning activity 7 i r 100 w e r w w 100 e r d v ρ e l v 3 e e r 2 3 model calibration body size scaling relationships provide rules for how primary parameters vary among phylogenetically related species kooijman 2010 the intensive parameters are related to biochemical processes and they are assumed roughly invariant among related species while the extensive parameters p a m and maturity thresholds depend on maximum size kooijman 2010 nisbet et al 2012 thus the extensive parameters can be directly adjusted using a zoom factor z defined as the ratio of the maximum structural length of species of interest to that of the reference species our model is very close to the model developed for pacific bluefin tuna pbt jusup et al 2011 with a slight difference in the energetic process related to the acquisition of thermoconservation ability in both models this acquisition resulted in an additional energy cost which gradually increases from metamorphosis until the end of the early juvenile stage for jusup et al 2011 while this additional cost appears at the end of the early juvenile stage in our model thus the parameters of adult pbt were used as a first approximation of primary parameters first the body size scaling relationships were used to infer the values of the surface area specific maximum assimilation rate p a m and the maturity thresholds e h j e h e and e h p from those of pbt under constant food and temperature conditions the maximum structural length can be related to the physical asymptotic length l f thus the maximum structural length of yft was estimated from an asymptotic length fixed to 200 cm lf as follows 8 l m δ j l f f then the shape parameter δj the structural volume density dv and the weight energy coupler ρe can be estimated from the length weight relationship of juveniles as juveniles do not store energy for reproduction the wet weight ww can be expressed from the physical length and the reserve density e e l v 3 j cm 3 as follows 9 w w δ j 3 l f 3 d v e ρ e this length weight relationship was fitted to data of wild immature yft including 87 fish measuring 29 61 cm and weighing 0 39 4 2 kg in a bayesian framework without prior knowledge an uninformative inverse gamma distributions was assigned to e dv was assigned a normal distribution centered on 1 δj was assumed to vary according to a beta prior distribution between 0 and 1 ρe was fixed such that the ratio of ρe to δj was the same as in jusup et al 2011 the parameters estimate was based on sampling approach of markov chain monte carlo simulations as implemented in openbugs version 3 2 1 spiegelhalter et al 2011 three mcmc chains of 100 000 samples thinned to one draw every 1000 th sample were used to estimate the parameters the convergence to the stationary posterior distribution was assessed by the gelman rubin diagnostic from the second half of mcmc simulation sample gelman and rubin 1992 the arrhenius temperature ta was deduced from the value of the van t hoff coefficient q 10 estimated for juveniles pacific yft i e 1 65 at 18 24 c and 1 67 at 24 30 c dewar and graham 1994 the q 10 is a correcting factor applied to metabolic rates for every 10 c increase in temperature for any body temperature t q 10 and ta are related according to the following relationship 10 q 10 exp 10 t a t t 10 the maturity thresholds e h j e h e and e h p were adjusted such that the corresponding physical lengths are consistent with available knowledge from literature the metamorphosis of yft occurs at about 13 mm standard length sl kaji et al 1999 the end of early juvenile stage corresponds to a size of 20 cm lf wexler et al 2011 and the puberty to a size close to 75 cm lf zudaire et al 2013 finally the energy density for a single batch eb was estimated from the relationship between the fork length and the batch fecundity observed for wild yft 2 4 model validation using simulation different simulations were performed to assess the model suitability firstly the model was used to simulate the growth in length the length weight relationship the food daily ration fdr and the food conversion ratio fcr the simulation outputs were then compared to the observations described in the study of wexler et al 2003 the fdr body wet weight per day was calculated as the ratio between wet weight of ingested food wx and the wet weight of an individual ww at each time step of the simulation i e 1 day at any time t 11 f d r 100 w x t w w t the fcr was calculated as the ratio between the wet weight of ingested food and increased wet weight of an individual over time interval of 1 day ignoring the weight of the reproduction buffer 12 f c r w x t 1 w v t w e t w v t 1 w e t 1 the wet weight of ingested food at time t was calculated using the following equation 13 w x t f p a m l v t 2 κ x ρ x ρx is the energy content of 1 g of food estimated from the caloric value of prey given in wexler et al 2003 as the prey provided to farmed yft for a given day was not specified three values illustrating the range of possible levels in terms of energy were used for ρx these values corresponded to the most energetic species 6471 j g 1 the less energetic species 2980 j g 1 and the mean 4910 j g 1 this first simulation was performed for a constant food density expressed through a scaled functional response f 0 925 and for body temperatures considered equivalent to the daily temperatures in the experimental tank wexler et al 2003 the age and length at the experiment start were considered as initial conditions i e an age of 395 days and a length of 53 cm lf from which we deduced a structural length l v 13 53 cm and a maturity level e h 2 460 526 j the seasonal reproductive investment ir eq 7 was explored with another simulation this latter simulation was run under constant body temperature of 27 c and constant food density f 0 925 from metamorphosis to fish death the initial state of the system agreed with the fish state at metamorphosis i e a maturity level e h j an age of 30 days and a fork length of 1 3 cm from which we deduced a structural length of 0 33 cm both simulations were performed with a 1 day time step using the dde function a numerical solver for delay differential equations implemented in the pbsddesolve package couture beil et al 2010 of the r software r development core team 2010 2 5 investigating eco physiological factors behind the growth stanzas in this section we investigated through simulations two main assumptions that could explain the growth stanzas observed in wild yft i a decrease of competition for food resource due to change in schooling behavior and ii a change in food diet due to habitat change in relation with the improvement of some physiological traits for both assumptions the growth in length was simulated with a 1 day time step under constant temperature of 27 c from metamorphosis to fish death the average annual growth rates by 10 cm size class from 20 to 90 cm were computed and compared to those of wild indian ocean yft as estimated by dortel et al 2015 with otolith data and otolith and length frequency data the relative root mean square error rmse a normalized indicator that measures the discrepancy between the average annual growth rates simulated r and estimated for wild indian ocean yft r was used 14 r m s e r r 2 r 2 5 1 competition for food resource juveniles of yft form mixed schools with juveniles of bigeye tuna and skipjack tuna under floating objects such as the fish aggregating devices fads deployed in purse seine fisheries to increase fishing success fonteneau et al 2013 within the schools the inter and intra species competition for food resource is assumed to be strong which could result in lower food intake by young yft as compared to adults hallier and gaertner 2008 potier et al 2001 sardenne et al 2016 in our simulations this was expressed by a lower value of food density modeled through a lower scaled functional response below 70 cm lf which corresponds to the size at which yft leave the schools associated with floating objects fonteneau et al 2013 two functional responses fj and fp for juvenile and adult stages respectively were defined such that fj fp and the effect of an abrupt transition from fj to fp was investigated four values of fj were tested 0 8 0 825 0 85 and 0 875 for a value of fp fixed to 0 925 2 5 2 food diet change in the indian ocean yft feed on a wide variety of epipelagic and mesopelagic fish crustaceans and cephalopods and their diet varies according to size and foraging depth maldeniya 1996 potier et al 2004 zudaire et al 2015 adult yft are dispersed over a wider geographical area covering deeper and colder waters and contrary to juveniles they can dive below the thermocline to forage schaefer et al 2011 thus juveniles might have access to a range of prey which might be not as nutritious as for adults this was expressed in our simulations through a lower surface area specific maximum assimilation rate for yft smaller than 60 cm lf the minimum size of fish exhibiting deep dives schaefer et al 2011 two assimilation rates p a m j and p a m p were defined for juveniles ans adults respectively such that p a m j p a m p and the effect on growth of an abrupt transition from p a m j to p a m p was investigated we considered two values of p a m j 3900 and 4000 j day 1 cm 2 for a value of p a m p fixed to 4370 j day 1 cm 2 3 results 3 1 validation of a reference deb model for yellowfin tuna the reference deb model successfully reproduced the growth in length and the length weight relationship observed for farmed pacific yft as described in the study of wexler et al 2003 furthermore the observed values of fdr and fcr were well within the simulated range fig 2 thus the set of parameters some of which were derived from pbt jusup et al 2011 appeared suitable to assess the effects of variations in the quantity and quality of food on yft growth table 1 from the length weight relationship for immature yft the value of dv was estimated to be significantly higher than 1 table 4 this is in agreement with the observation that tuna have a higher density than seawater magnuson 1973 the value of ρe was found to be lower than for pbt reflecting a lower energetic value for yft due to a lower mass of red muscle from the q 10 values observed for juvenile yft in pacific ocean the arrhenius temperature was estimated at 4622 495 207 k this value was lower than that of pbt estimated at about 5298 k which could indicate that yft are less sensitive to temperature variations within their temperature tolerance range although more temperature data would be required to validate this assumption 3 2 yellowfin growth according to the reference deb model for a constant temperature of 27 c and a constant food density f 0 925 the reference deb model forecasted particularly fast growth until the end of the early juvenile stage then it predicted a von bertalanffy type growth regarding wild indian yft the model appeared suitable for adult growth but overestimated juvenile growth fig 3 a the puberty was reached at a length of abour 75 cm corresponding to an age of 1 4 years the evolution of weight relative to length was higher than expected which may indicate a too high level of food density fig 3 b the energy stored in the reproduction buffer was also converted in weight to determine the seasonal reproductive investment this latter increased with fish size up to 27 8 of total body wet weight for fish of 89 kg 150 cm lf and then slightly decreased to 25 9 of body wet weight fig 4 3 3 effect of food density a decrease in food supply during the juvenile stage resulted in lower growth rates from 20 to 60 depending on the f values for a value between 0 825 and especially 0 85 the model predicted a two stanza growth which better captured the juvenile growth leading to 52 71 and 81 87 decrease in rmse values between 30 70 cm compared to the reference model table 5 but as shown in fig 5 a the model underestimated the magnitude of growth acceleration the age at puberty increased at 1 83 2 11 2 5 and 3 14 years for a decrease in f from 0 875 to 0 8 while the fork length at puberty remained almost constant and varied around 74 9 cm 3 4 effect of prey quality a reduced energy intake in young yft led to an average decrease in the growth rate of 37 and 29 for p a m j values of 3900 and 4000 j day 1 cm 2 respectively for both values the model was able to capture the juvenile growth as shown by the 66 72 and 86 87 decrease in rmse values between 30 60 cm table 5 but it underestimated the magnitude of growth acceleration fig 5 b the predicted age and fork length at puberty were 2 2 years for 74 79 cm and 1 96 years for 74 77 cm for p a m j values of 3900 and 4000 j day 1 cm 2 respectively 4 discussion we formulated a bioenergetic model covering the juvenile and adult stages of yft in the context of dynamic energy budget theory some essential parameters of the model were estimated with bayesian analysis from morphometric age and reproduction data sets collected from yft sampled in the indian ocean while other parameters were derived from the deb model developed for pbt jusup et al 2011 our results show that both lower food availability in the juvenile stage and ontogenetic changes in food diet characterized by the consumption of more energetic prey in older fish can explain the complex two stanza growth observed in wild but not captive yft both assumptions could explain the growth acceleration observed in wild yft but none of them was self sufficient to reflect the level of change observed we thus assumed that the observed acceleration resulted from a combination of both processes 4 1 yellowfin deb model deb theory allows to describe continuously growth and reproduction over the organism lifespan nisbet et al 2012 hence deb theory appeared as a particularly suitable framework for the study of yft growth throughout different life stages however the experimental data currently available on yft physiology are insufficient for estimating a comprehensive set of parameters it was however possible to benefit from the work on pbt through the use of the body size scaling relationships kooijman 2010 pecquerie et al 2011 under these relationships yft and pbt have similar metabolic and physiological processes and the differences between the two species would mainly result in lower energy assimilation by yft this assumption may not be quite accurate indeed bluefin tuna have greater abilities for conservation of metabolic heat due to more developed vascular heat exchanger systems and a higher proportion of red muscle resulting in a more extensive thermal niche than yft blank et al 2007 shadwick et al 2013 as the internal heat production is scaled with the surface the surface area specific maintenance costs p t are probably lower for yft despite that the set of parameters approximated from primary parameters of pbt has proved particularly suitable for reproducing the experiments on captive yft and the model predictions appeared in agreement with the knowledge of the species biology in constant conditions of temperature and food the reference model forecasted particularly fast initial growth until the end of the early juvenile stage then as was expected for farmed fish it complied with a von bertalanffy growth with relatively high growth rates for juveniles and young adults which gradually slowed as asymptotic length approaches the warming ability of tissues from retention of metabolic heat appears toward the end of the early juvenile stage shadwick et al 2013 according to our assumption this ability is associated with an additional somatic maintenance cost and it led to a change in the energy balance resulting in a growth slowdown regarding wild yft the growth pattern predicted by the reference model was consistent with the adult growth over 90 cm lf but it overestimated growth in juvenile and pre adult stages therefore the puberty was reached at a length of about 75 cm lf consistent with observations of length at maturity in the indian ocean 75 90 cm rohit and rammohan 2009 zudaire et al 2013 but at 1 4 years an earlier age than expected by the growth model of indian ocean yft 2 2 2 5 years dortel et al 2015 by contrast the predicted length weight relationship appeared suitable for juveniles but the model overestimated the weight gain over 100 cm lf suggesting an excessive weight contribution of the reproduction buffer 4 2 growth and population dynamics a comparison of the biological parameters used in population dynamics models shows major differences in growth pattern and rates between the four world stocks of yft pecoraro et al 2017 the plasticity in tuna growth has generally been attributed to differences in oceanographic parameters e g sea temperature and prey availability e g dueri and maury 2010 and the environment and oceanic food webs that support yft vary substantially across oceans and regions pethybridge et al 2018 the availability of data sources and choice of estimation method may however also modify the growth models and affect our perception of tuna growth kolody et al 2016 in the indian ocean historical and recent studies based on multiple data sources support a marked two stanza growth pattern with a sharp acceleration in growth rate at about 60 65 cm fork length dortel et al 2015 eveson et al 2015 marsac and lablache 1985 in the atlantic ocean the two stanza growth model derived in the early 1990s from length frequency data and used for several assessments of the stock status of yft gascuel et al 1992 has been challenged by direct age estimates from counts of daily growth increments in sagittal otoliths that support a von bertalanffy growth curve shuford et al 2007 results from otolith reading however appear inconsistent with the maximum length of atlantic yft and growth rates derived from past tagging programs conducted by the international commission for the conservation of atlantic tunas calling for further studies integrating information from multiple data sources in this ocean fonteneau and chassot 2013 recent mark recapture data collected in the atlantic ocean indicate that tagged fish released with lengths of less than 65 cm tend to grow slower than expected from a von bertalanffy model while fish above 65 cm tend to grow faster a pattern modelled with a richards growth curve in the most recent assessment of atlantic yft iccat 2019 as part of the atlantic ocean tropical tuna tagging program some work is ongoing to develop an integrated growth model accounting for the new data set collected on yft growth tropical tuna growth is the major focus of current research in the pacific ocean farley et al 2018 in the western central pacific ocean the growth model used for assessing the stock of yft predicts a growth rate slowing between about 40 and 70 cm similarly to that observed in the indian ocean lehodey and leroy 1999 tremblay boyer et al 2017 changes in configuration of the yft population model also suggest some regional differences in estimated growth rates consistently with direct age estimates and mark recapture experiments tremblay boyer et al 2017 preliminary results from annual increment counts in otoliths suggest that the degree of two stanza might however be lower than previously considered farley et al 2019 in the eastern pacific ocean the stock of yft shows a more classical growth pattern than that observed in the other ocean basins minte vera et al 2020 the ageing technique based on daily increment counts for this stock has however recently been challenged farley et al 2019 ongoing research focusing on annual increments in otoliths is expected to shed the light on the growth of the two stocks of pacific yft 4 3 behavioral changes behind the two stanza growth according to the experiment of wexler et al 2003 farmed yft did not exhibit the growth acceleration occurring around 65 cm lf for wild fish similarly to the experiment of achotines the growth pattern of yft held in captivity for several years at the tuna research and conservation center trcc in pacific grove california is well described by a von bertalanffy model estess et al 2017 in this experiment yft were however found to grow significantly slower than those of the iattc experiment these observations supported that the origin of the stanza growth would rather be behavioral or ecological than physiological in captivity the food intake is adjusted to comply with the nutritional requirements of tunas which do not suffer from competition for food thus the growth stanza would be caused by a behavioral change related to feeding indeed both assumptions i e a low food availability and the consumption of less energetic prey during the juvenile stage led to a two stanza growth with growth acceleration in relation with behavioral change for a decrease in food density x from 54 to 62 or a reduction in the assimilation rates from 8 5 to 10 75 the model captured the juvenile growth but the intensity of growth acceleration and overall adult growth were underestimated in addition yft reached puberty at similar sizes as those predicted by the reference model but at older ages leading to age values in better agreement with those expected i e between 2 2 and 2 5 years according to the growth curve of indian ocean yft dortel et al 2015 several lines of evidence support low feeding rates for juveniles of yft when they occur in mixed schools associated with drifting objects in particular stomach content analysis points out to a much higher proportion of empty stomachs for fish caught from associated schools which are significantly slimmer than yft caught in free swimming schools hallier and gaertner 2008 jaquemet et al 2011 potier et al 2001 this might be explained by the high level of intra species competition and decreased foraging success in yft when they occur in large schools maury 2017 yft is an opportunistic species that feeds on a large number of prey categories and trophic studies underline a change in diet with size as well as the ability of larger yft to forage in deeper waters potier et al 2007 2004 firstly yft feed mainly on planktonic crustaceans and then from 50 cm lf they become essentially piscivorous with a decline in crustaceans consumption and a strong consumption of cephalopods between 80 100 cm maldeniya 1996 potier et al 2001 recent analysis of fatty acids and stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen showed some major ontogenetic changes in the diet of indian ocean yft sardenne et al 2016 in particular the shift in concentration of neutral fatty acids observed in the liver of yft at around 70 80 cm might reflect the change of habitat from surface to deeper layers where rich mufa prey of yft such as myctophids and their predators are more abundant sardenne et al 2016 investigating the caloric value of prey found in yft stomach contents at various size classes would be useful to quantitatively assess the energetic contribution of each prey group to the ontogenetic changes in diet 4 4 variability in yft growth most tuna stock assessments assume a constant individual growth described with some individual variability around the mean kolody et al 2016 changes in population abundance and environmental conditions may however affect growth rates over space and time as evidenced for southern bluefin tuna lorenzen 2016 polacheck et al 2004 growth parameters used for the assessment of indian ocean yft are considered constant over almost seven decades when the stock has experienced a strong decline in abundance iotc 2018 and yft fishing grounds have been characterized by major temporal changes in temperature and primary productivity roxy et al 2016 furthermore the increasing use of fads to aggregate juveniles of yft and skipjack tuna since the early 1990s might have increased intra and inter species competition and led to changes in growth rates hallier and gaertner 2008 marsac et al 2000 assessing the influence of fad density on yft growth is very difficult due to the lack of routine monitoring for ageing tunas linked to the high costs and logistics of sampling and otolith reading developing standard ageing procedures across tuna rfmos with otolith reference collections constitutes a first step to monitor changes in age length relationships and promote the comparison of tuna growth between oceans farley et al 2019 sardenne et al 2015 in addition we recommend the systematic implementation of comprehensive ageing projects in conjunction with large scale tagging programs every five or ten years to track changes in tuna growth rates and better account for growth variability in the demographic analysis of these socio economically important species 5 conclusion perspectives building on the dynamic energy budget modelling framework that mechanistically links the biology of individual organisms to abiotic drivers kooijman 2010 our model suggests that the unique growth pattern observed in wild yft could stem from a major change in intensity of schooling and associative behavior with size which would substantially modify both the quantity and quality of food available for maintenance reproduction and growth this change would be triggered by the acquisition of physiological abilities and anatomical traits with age and result in an ontogenetic shift in the biotic habitat and trophic ecology of yft in addition the intensity of schooling might depend on population abundance with higher density resulting in the formation of larger schools described by a higher degree of competition maury 2017 maury and poggiale 2013 next steps of the work will include the development of a comprehensive calibration and sensitivity analysis to identify the most influential parameters of the model and estimate the ranges of values driving different shapes of growth curves and the associated age length keys that are used for assessing the status of yft stocks to this end the data collected at trcc would be useful to estimate a comprehensive set of parameters as well as to disentangle the relative contributions of water temperature and low energy diet on the low growth rates of yft observed at trcc more generally tuna morphometric and bioenergetic data collected for scientific purpose under controlled environmental conditions are extremely difficult and costly to obtain estess et al 2017

24727,the growth of yellowfin tuna has been the subject of considerable research efforts since the early 1960s most studies support a complex two stanza growth pattern with a sharp acceleration departing from the von bertalanffy growth curve used for most fish populations this growth pattern has been assumed to result from a combination of physiological ecological and behavioral factors but the role and contribution of each of them have not been addressed yet we developed a bioenergetic model for yellowfin tuna in the context of dynamic energy budget theory to mechanistically represent the processes governing yellowfin tuna growth most parameters of the model were inferred from pacific bluefin tuna using body size scaling relationships while some essential parameters were estimated from biological data sets collected in the indian ocean the model proved particularly suitable for reproducing the data collected during the pacific yellowfin tuna farming experience conducted by the inter american tropical tuna commission at the achotines laboratory in panama in addition model predictions appeared in agreement with knowledge of the biology and ecology of wild yellowfin tuna we used our model to explore through simulations two major assumptions that might explain the existence of growth stanzas observed in wild yellowfin tuna i a lower food supply during juvenile stage in relation with high intra and inter species competition and ii ontogenetic changes in food diet our results show that both assumptions are plausible although none of them is self sufficient to explain the intensity of growth acceleration observed in wild indian ocean yellowfin tuna suggesting that the two factors may act in concert our study shows that the yellowfin growth pattern is likely due to behavioral changes triggered by the acquisition of physiological abilities and anatomical traits through ontogeny that result in a major change in intensity of schooling and in a shift in the biotic habitat and trophic ecology of this commercially important tuna species keywords deb theory body size scaling behavioral changes ontogeny 1 introduction yellowfin tuna thunnus albacares yft is an epipelagic species widely distributed in the tropical and subtropical waters of the world s major oceans pecoraro et al 2017 owing to its high value as food source yft supports important commercial and recreational fisheries with an annual global catch of about 1 3 million tonnes in the last decade it ranks among the world s ten most harvested marine species fao 2018 at global scale yft has recently been assessed as near threatened following the red list criteria of the international union for conservation of nature collette et al 2001 while the assessments of the status of its four oceanic stocks conducted within the tuna regional fisheries management organizations indicate that overfishing currently occurs in the indian ocean iotc 2018 for assessment and management purpose growth of wild yft has been the subject of considerable research efforts since the 1960s through analysis of mark recapture data size frequency distribution of commercial fishery catches and ageing from calcified and bony structures diaz 1963 schaefer et al 1961 wild and foreman 1980 yft growth varies between ocean basins and regions and shows in some areas some complex pattern that departs from the traditional von bertalanffy growth curve used for most fish stocks pecoraro et al 2017 in particular some growth studies conducted in the atlantic indian and western central pacific oceans support a two stanza growth pattern with a sharp acceleration in growth rate at about 60 65 cm fork length dortel et al 2015 eveson et al 2015 gascuel et al 1992 lehodey and leroy 1999 the complex growth pattern observed in some populations of yft has been assumed to result from a combination of physiological ecological and behavioral factors but the role and contribution of each of them have not been addressed yet bard 1984 dortel et al 2015 fonteneau 1980 gaertner and pagavino 1992 a better understanding of these mechanisms is essential to assess the plasticity of yft growth and eventually strengthen the scientific advice on the stock status and improve the overall quality of current stock assessments we investigated the factors governing the growth of yft with a bioenergetic model that covers the different post metamorphic life stages of the indian ocean yft within the framework of the dynamic energy budget deb theory kooijman 2010 deb theory has already proven successful to study growth and reproduction of a large range of marine taxa freitas et al 2010 pecquerie et al 2009 sousa tia et al 2008 van der veer et al 2006 and more recently to study the dynamics of populations and ecosystems maury 2017 maury and poggiale 2013 pethybridge et al 2013 other bioenergetic approaches are available but they are generally specific to a particular life stage and unsuitable for modelling the changes between distinct life stages hansen et al 1993 ney 1993 in contrast the deb theory provides a powerful conceptual framework to describe the lifelong growth in relation to other physiological requirements such as metabolism and body internal maintenance development and reproduction as a function of environmental food conditions and organism state freitas et al 2010 kooijman 2010 2 materials and methods 2 1 data sources we collected data sets from the literature for both wild and farmed yft to compare the outputs of the bioenergetic model with morphometric ageing and reproduction observations 2 1 1 wild indian ocean yellowfin tuna for wild yft we considered a length at age data set collected throughout the regional tuna tagging project rttp a large scale mark recapture program conducted in the western indian ocean between 2005 2007 and the west sumatra tuna tagging project wsttp a tagging program conducted off the western indonesian coast in august 2007 anonymous 2008 murua et al 2015 all lengths were measured with a measuring board to the nearest 0 1 cm in fork length lf i e the projected straight distance measured from the tip of the upper jaw to the shortest caudal ray fish ages were estimated from readings of saggital otoliths collected from i 128 yft caught through the rttp and measuring between 43 72 cm lf at tagging and 47 9 135 4 cm lf at recapture ii 18 fish caught through the wsttp measuring between 19 29 cm lf iii 35 fish including 7 females collected from 2008 to 2009 at the indian ocean tuna ltd cannery and measuring between 31 147 5 cm lf morize et al 2008 sardenne et al 2015 otoliths were prepared for age analysis and read at the laboratoire de sclérochronologie des animaux aquatiques brest france following the method described by stéquert 1995 the number of otolith growth increments was counted repeatedly for different otolith sections morize et al 2008 sardenne et al 2015 the ages were estimated from these counts using an ageing error model that explicitly accounts for process and interpretation errors in otolith readings dortel et al 2013 we also considered length weight measurements from defrosted yft caught in the whole indian ocean basin fork length was measured with a caliper to the nearest 0 1 cm and total weight was measured with a scale to the nearest 0 1 kg bodin et al 2018 the data set included i 5089 fish from the indian ocean tuna ltd cannery caught during 2005 2012 66 165 cm lf 5 8 87 5 kg and ii 100 additional fish collected in 2010 2013 of which 35 females 54 7 148 2 cm lf 3 4 61 5 kg and 65 individuals whose sex was indeterminate 29 61 cm lf 0 4 4 1 kg finally we used a data set of batch fecundity i e number of eggs released per batch derived from gravimetric method applied to 40 yft females in the size range 79 146 9 cm lf that were collected on board commercial purse seiners in the western indian ocean during 2009 2010 zudaire et al 2013 the batch fecundity varied from 0 32 million to 6 91 million eggs with a mean of 3 07 million eggs 2 1 2 farmed pacific yellowfin tuna we used data from yft farming experiment conducted by the inter american tropical tuna commission iattc in achotines laboratory in the republic of panama wexler et al 2003 this experiment lasted over 3 years and involved 55 yft 53 females 46 males caught in the coastal waters of the northwest panama bight in 1996 and 1998 and then transferred in a broodstock yft tank the tank was filled with seawater and semi open to ocean thus the temperature and salinity in tank were influenced by the seasonal fluctuations in ocean upwelling and rainfall during the experiment daily temperatures in tank ranged from 20 1 to 29 7 c with an average of 27 5 c yft were fed once per day with one of five prey species whose caloric values were calculated based on metabolizable energy values of protein 17 7 kj g 1 and lipid 33 5 kj g 1 the length and wet weight of fish were measured at the time of the transfer in the tank and at their death the food daily rations fdr body wet weight day are also available from the literature wexler et al 2003 they were calculated as the ratio between the wet weight of ingested food and the wet weight of an individual at each time step t of the simulation i e 1 day a food conversion ratio fcr was estimated as the ratio between the wet weight of ingested food on increasing biomass over given times intervals of 12 103 days for a constant number of yft 2 2 description of the yellowfin tuna deb model 2 2 1 state variables and dynamics the yellowfin tuna life cycle includes five different stages embryo larva early juvenile juvenile and adult in this study we implemented a bioenergetic model based on deb theory kooijman 2010 that only describes three life stages of yft early juvenile juvenile and adult this model was focused on an individual fish defined by four state variables reserve e in j structural length lv in cm maturation eh in j and reproduction er in j instead of the dynamics of the reserve e we followed the dynamics of the scaled reserve density e which is driven by the dynamics of e the scaled reserve density e e e m is a dimensionless quantity where e e l v 3 is the reserve density and em represents the maximum reserve density the four state variables and the parameters used are described in table 2 the dynamics of the state variables fig 1 are controlled by various energy fluxes varying with size and body temperature table 3 the energy derived from ingested food is directly assimilated into the reserve p a from there the energy is mobilized according to the κ rule a constant fraction κ is allocated to somatic maintenance p s and growth p g with priority for somatic maintenance the rest is allocated to maturity maintenance p j and maturation or reproduction in adults p r with priority for maturity maintenance maturation explicitly refers to the fish development and the transitions from one stage to another occur for defined maturity thresholds e h e from early juvenile to juvenile and e h p from juvenile to fully developed adult the beginning of the juvenile stage is marked by the acquisition of thermoconservation ability a notable property of most tuna species compared to other fish species brill 1994 from about 20 cm lf yft is able to raise the temperature in some parts of its body above the seawater temperature by the storage of the metabolic heat through vascular heat exchanger systems shadwick et al 2013 wexler et al 2011 we assumed that the thermoconservation ability of yft involved energetic costs proportional to the square of structural length the initiation of the thermoconservation ability occurs as a point in time once eh reaches e h e eq d2 in table 2 this assumption slightly simplifies the model compared to the deb based model developed for the pacific bluefin tuna thunnus orientalis which considered a gradual increase of the energetic costs associated with regional endothermy jusup et al 2011 once at the adult stage the maturity level does not increase any further and the fish stores energy in a reproduction buffer throughout the year during a spawning season the energy stored in the reproduction buffer is converted to eggs according to species specific handling rules two spawning seasons are observed a main season from november to march and a second minor period in june july stéquert et al 2001 zudaire et al 2013 as observed for pacific yft we considered that spawning is triggered when water temperature reaches 24 c and ends above 28 c itano 2000 margulies et al 2007 spawning was considered to occur almost daily from december march and june july and for seawater temperatures between 24 c and 28 c when the reproduction buffer contains sufficient energy to produce a batch consistent with the multiple batch spawning behaviour of yft the energy stored in reproduction buffer is released through several batches with an increasing energy requirement per batch as fish grows the energy required to produce one batch eb in j includes the energy content of eggs and energy losses to convert the energy of reproduction buffer into yolk material 1 e b e b l v 3 κ r where eb is the energy density of one batch j cm 3 the number of eggs released per batch nb can be estimated from the energy requirement per batch and the energy content of one egg e 0 following 2 n b e b e 0 where e 0 was estimated to have a mean value of 1 295 j based on the mean dry weight of an egg of captive yellowfin about 0 043 mg margulies et al 2007 and the lipid contents of the eggs of wild atlantic bluefin tuna thunnus thynnus and bonito sarda sarda estimated to be 7 953 j mg 1 i e 26 4 of the total caloric value of a freshly spawned egg or approximately 20 of its dry mass ortega and mourente 2010 2 2 2 forcing variables consistent with deb theory two forcing variables were considered the body temperature t k and the food density x j m 3 body temperature affects all the metabolic fluxes including the maximum assimilation p a m the somatic maintenance rates p m and p t as well as v and k j the values of those rates fluctuate within a species specific tolerance range as described by the arrhenius relationship let k t the value of a metabolic rate k at any temperature t k ta the species specific arrhenius temperature k and t 1 a chosen reference temperature k 3 k t k t 1 exp t a t 1 t a t the food density is converted into ingestion according to a holling type ii scaled functional response a dimensionless quantity defined as 4 f x x x k xk the half saturation constant is the food density for which the ingestion rate is half its maximum value kooijman 2010 2 2 3 link between state variables and fishery observations the deb state variables cannot be measured directly only indirectly with additional assumptions to relate these state variables with the observations such as length weight and fecundity the structural length lv is related to the physical length expressed in fork length lf cm using the species specific shape coefficient δj 5 l f l v δ j the wet weight ww g has contributions from structure wv reserve we and also from reproduction buffer for adults w e r and it expresses as follows 6 w w w v w e w e r d v l v 3 e e r ρ e where dv is the density of the structural volume g cm 3 and ρe is the energy content per gram of reserve or reproduction buffer we also define the reproductive investment ir as the ratio between the weight of reproduction buffer and the wet weight of fish this latter provides information on the weight losses due to the spawning activity 7 i r 100 w e r w w 100 e r d v ρ e l v 3 e e r 2 3 model calibration body size scaling relationships provide rules for how primary parameters vary among phylogenetically related species kooijman 2010 the intensive parameters are related to biochemical processes and they are assumed roughly invariant among related species while the extensive parameters p a m and maturity thresholds depend on maximum size kooijman 2010 nisbet et al 2012 thus the extensive parameters can be directly adjusted using a zoom factor z defined as the ratio of the maximum structural length of species of interest to that of the reference species our model is very close to the model developed for pacific bluefin tuna pbt jusup et al 2011 with a slight difference in the energetic process related to the acquisition of thermoconservation ability in both models this acquisition resulted in an additional energy cost which gradually increases from metamorphosis until the end of the early juvenile stage for jusup et al 2011 while this additional cost appears at the end of the early juvenile stage in our model thus the parameters of adult pbt were used as a first approximation of primary parameters first the body size scaling relationships were used to infer the values of the surface area specific maximum assimilation rate p a m and the maturity thresholds e h j e h e and e h p from those of pbt under constant food and temperature conditions the maximum structural length can be related to the physical asymptotic length l f thus the maximum structural length of yft was estimated from an asymptotic length fixed to 200 cm lf as follows 8 l m δ j l f f then the shape parameter δj the structural volume density dv and the weight energy coupler ρe can be estimated from the length weight relationship of juveniles as juveniles do not store energy for reproduction the wet weight ww can be expressed from the physical length and the reserve density e e l v 3 j cm 3 as follows 9 w w δ j 3 l f 3 d v e ρ e this length weight relationship was fitted to data of wild immature yft including 87 fish measuring 29 61 cm and weighing 0 39 4 2 kg in a bayesian framework without prior knowledge an uninformative inverse gamma distributions was assigned to e dv was assigned a normal distribution centered on 1 δj was assumed to vary according to a beta prior distribution between 0 and 1 ρe was fixed such that the ratio of ρe to δj was the same as in jusup et al 2011 the parameters estimate was based on sampling approach of markov chain monte carlo simulations as implemented in openbugs version 3 2 1 spiegelhalter et al 2011 three mcmc chains of 100 000 samples thinned to one draw every 1000 th sample were used to estimate the parameters the convergence to the stationary posterior distribution was assessed by the gelman rubin diagnostic from the second half of mcmc simulation sample gelman and rubin 1992 the arrhenius temperature ta was deduced from the value of the van t hoff coefficient q 10 estimated for juveniles pacific yft i e 1 65 at 18 24 c and 1 67 at 24 30 c dewar and graham 1994 the q 10 is a correcting factor applied to metabolic rates for every 10 c increase in temperature for any body temperature t q 10 and ta are related according to the following relationship 10 q 10 exp 10 t a t t 10 the maturity thresholds e h j e h e and e h p were adjusted such that the corresponding physical lengths are consistent with available knowledge from literature the metamorphosis of yft occurs at about 13 mm standard length sl kaji et al 1999 the end of early juvenile stage corresponds to a size of 20 cm lf wexler et al 2011 and the puberty to a size close to 75 cm lf zudaire et al 2013 finally the energy density for a single batch eb was estimated from the relationship between the fork length and the batch fecundity observed for wild yft 2 4 model validation using simulation different simulations were performed to assess the model suitability firstly the model was used to simulate the growth in length the length weight relationship the food daily ration fdr and the food conversion ratio fcr the simulation outputs were then compared to the observations described in the study of wexler et al 2003 the fdr body wet weight per day was calculated as the ratio between wet weight of ingested food wx and the wet weight of an individual ww at each time step of the simulation i e 1 day at any time t 11 f d r 100 w x t w w t the fcr was calculated as the ratio between the wet weight of ingested food and increased wet weight of an individual over time interval of 1 day ignoring the weight of the reproduction buffer 12 f c r w x t 1 w v t w e t w v t 1 w e t 1 the wet weight of ingested food at time t was calculated using the following equation 13 w x t f p a m l v t 2 κ x ρ x ρx is the energy content of 1 g of food estimated from the caloric value of prey given in wexler et al 2003 as the prey provided to farmed yft for a given day was not specified three values illustrating the range of possible levels in terms of energy were used for ρx these values corresponded to the most energetic species 6471 j g 1 the less energetic species 2980 j g 1 and the mean 4910 j g 1 this first simulation was performed for a constant food density expressed through a scaled functional response f 0 925 and for body temperatures considered equivalent to the daily temperatures in the experimental tank wexler et al 2003 the age and length at the experiment start were considered as initial conditions i e an age of 395 days and a length of 53 cm lf from which we deduced a structural length l v 13 53 cm and a maturity level e h 2 460 526 j the seasonal reproductive investment ir eq 7 was explored with another simulation this latter simulation was run under constant body temperature of 27 c and constant food density f 0 925 from metamorphosis to fish death the initial state of the system agreed with the fish state at metamorphosis i e a maturity level e h j an age of 30 days and a fork length of 1 3 cm from which we deduced a structural length of 0 33 cm both simulations were performed with a 1 day time step using the dde function a numerical solver for delay differential equations implemented in the pbsddesolve package couture beil et al 2010 of the r software r development core team 2010 2 5 investigating eco physiological factors behind the growth stanzas in this section we investigated through simulations two main assumptions that could explain the growth stanzas observed in wild yft i a decrease of competition for food resource due to change in schooling behavior and ii a change in food diet due to habitat change in relation with the improvement of some physiological traits for both assumptions the growth in length was simulated with a 1 day time step under constant temperature of 27 c from metamorphosis to fish death the average annual growth rates by 10 cm size class from 20 to 90 cm were computed and compared to those of wild indian ocean yft as estimated by dortel et al 2015 with otolith data and otolith and length frequency data the relative root mean square error rmse a normalized indicator that measures the discrepancy between the average annual growth rates simulated r and estimated for wild indian ocean yft r was used 14 r m s e r r 2 r 2 5 1 competition for food resource juveniles of yft form mixed schools with juveniles of bigeye tuna and skipjack tuna under floating objects such as the fish aggregating devices fads deployed in purse seine fisheries to increase fishing success fonteneau et al 2013 within the schools the inter and intra species competition for food resource is assumed to be strong which could result in lower food intake by young yft as compared to adults hallier and gaertner 2008 potier et al 2001 sardenne et al 2016 in our simulations this was expressed by a lower value of food density modeled through a lower scaled functional response below 70 cm lf which corresponds to the size at which yft leave the schools associated with floating objects fonteneau et al 2013 two functional responses fj and fp for juvenile and adult stages respectively were defined such that fj fp and the effect of an abrupt transition from fj to fp was investigated four values of fj were tested 0 8 0 825 0 85 and 0 875 for a value of fp fixed to 0 925 2 5 2 food diet change in the indian ocean yft feed on a wide variety of epipelagic and mesopelagic fish crustaceans and cephalopods and their diet varies according to size and foraging depth maldeniya 1996 potier et al 2004 zudaire et al 2015 adult yft are dispersed over a wider geographical area covering deeper and colder waters and contrary to juveniles they can dive below the thermocline to forage schaefer et al 2011 thus juveniles might have access to a range of prey which might be not as nutritious as for adults this was expressed in our simulations through a lower surface area specific maximum assimilation rate for yft smaller than 60 cm lf the minimum size of fish exhibiting deep dives schaefer et al 2011 two assimilation rates p a m j and p a m p were defined for juveniles ans adults respectively such that p a m j p a m p and the effect on growth of an abrupt transition from p a m j to p a m p was investigated we considered two values of p a m j 3900 and 4000 j day 1 cm 2 for a value of p a m p fixed to 4370 j day 1 cm 2 3 results 3 1 validation of a reference deb model for yellowfin tuna the reference deb model successfully reproduced the growth in length and the length weight relationship observed for farmed pacific yft as described in the study of wexler et al 2003 furthermore the observed values of fdr and fcr were well within the simulated range fig 2 thus the set of parameters some of which were derived from pbt jusup et al 2011 appeared suitable to assess the effects of variations in the quantity and quality of food on yft growth table 1 from the length weight relationship for immature yft the value of dv was estimated to be significantly higher than 1 table 4 this is in agreement with the observation that tuna have a higher density than seawater magnuson 1973 the value of ρe was found to be lower than for pbt reflecting a lower energetic value for yft due to a lower mass of red muscle from the q 10 values observed for juvenile yft in pacific ocean the arrhenius temperature was estimated at 4622 495 207 k this value was lower than that of pbt estimated at about 5298 k which could indicate that yft are less sensitive to temperature variations within their temperature tolerance range although more temperature data would be required to validate this assumption 3 2 yellowfin growth according to the reference deb model for a constant temperature of 27 c and a constant food density f 0 925 the reference deb model forecasted particularly fast growth until the end of the early juvenile stage then it predicted a von bertalanffy type growth regarding wild indian yft the model appeared suitable for adult growth but overestimated juvenile growth fig 3 a the puberty was reached at a length of abour 75 cm corresponding to an age of 1 4 years the evolution of weight relative to length was higher than expected which may indicate a too high level of food density fig 3 b the energy stored in the reproduction buffer was also converted in weight to determine the seasonal reproductive investment this latter increased with fish size up to 27 8 of total body wet weight for fish of 89 kg 150 cm lf and then slightly decreased to 25 9 of body wet weight fig 4 3 3 effect of food density a decrease in food supply during the juvenile stage resulted in lower growth rates from 20 to 60 depending on the f values for a value between 0 825 and especially 0 85 the model predicted a two stanza growth which better captured the juvenile growth leading to 52 71 and 81 87 decrease in rmse values between 30 70 cm compared to the reference model table 5 but as shown in fig 5 a the model underestimated the magnitude of growth acceleration the age at puberty increased at 1 83 2 11 2 5 and 3 14 years for a decrease in f from 0 875 to 0 8 while the fork length at puberty remained almost constant and varied around 74 9 cm 3 4 effect of prey quality a reduced energy intake in young yft led to an average decrease in the growth rate of 37 and 29 for p a m j values of 3900 and 4000 j day 1 cm 2 respectively for both values the model was able to capture the juvenile growth as shown by the 66 72 and 86 87 decrease in rmse values between 30 60 cm table 5 but it underestimated the magnitude of growth acceleration fig 5 b the predicted age and fork length at puberty were 2 2 years for 74 79 cm and 1 96 years for 74 77 cm for p a m j values of 3900 and 4000 j day 1 cm 2 respectively 4 discussion we formulated a bioenergetic model covering the juvenile and adult stages of yft in the context of dynamic energy budget theory some essential parameters of the model were estimated with bayesian analysis from morphometric age and reproduction data sets collected from yft sampled in the indian ocean while other parameters were derived from the deb model developed for pbt jusup et al 2011 our results show that both lower food availability in the juvenile stage and ontogenetic changes in food diet characterized by the consumption of more energetic prey in older fish can explain the complex two stanza growth observed in wild but not captive yft both assumptions could explain the growth acceleration observed in wild yft but none of them was self sufficient to reflect the level of change observed we thus assumed that the observed acceleration resulted from a combination of both processes 4 1 yellowfin deb model deb theory allows to describe continuously growth and reproduction over the organism lifespan nisbet et al 2012 hence deb theory appeared as a particularly suitable framework for the study of yft growth throughout different life stages however the experimental data currently available on yft physiology are insufficient for estimating a comprehensive set of parameters it was however possible to benefit from the work on pbt through the use of the body size scaling relationships kooijman 2010 pecquerie et al 2011 under these relationships yft and pbt have similar metabolic and physiological processes and the differences between the two species would mainly result in lower energy assimilation by yft this assumption may not be quite accurate indeed bluefin tuna have greater abilities for conservation of metabolic heat due to more developed vascular heat exchanger systems and a higher proportion of red muscle resulting in a more extensive thermal niche than yft blank et al 2007 shadwick et al 2013 as the internal heat production is scaled with the surface the surface area specific maintenance costs p t are probably lower for yft despite that the set of parameters approximated from primary parameters of pbt has proved particularly suitable for reproducing the experiments on captive yft and the model predictions appeared in agreement with the knowledge of the species biology in constant conditions of temperature and food the reference model forecasted particularly fast initial growth until the end of the early juvenile stage then as was expected for farmed fish it complied with a von bertalanffy growth with relatively high growth rates for juveniles and young adults which gradually slowed as asymptotic length approaches the warming ability of tissues from retention of metabolic heat appears toward the end of the early juvenile stage shadwick et al 2013 according to our assumption this ability is associated with an additional somatic maintenance cost and it led to a change in the energy balance resulting in a growth slowdown regarding wild yft the growth pattern predicted by the reference model was consistent with the adult growth over 90 cm lf but it overestimated growth in juvenile and pre adult stages therefore the puberty was reached at a length of about 75 cm lf consistent with observations of length at maturity in the indian ocean 75 90 cm rohit and rammohan 2009 zudaire et al 2013 but at 1 4 years an earlier age than expected by the growth model of indian ocean yft 2 2 2 5 years dortel et al 2015 by contrast the predicted length weight relationship appeared suitable for juveniles but the model overestimated the weight gain over 100 cm lf suggesting an excessive weight contribution of the reproduction buffer 4 2 growth and population dynamics a comparison of the biological parameters used in population dynamics models shows major differences in growth pattern and rates between the four world stocks of yft pecoraro et al 2017 the plasticity in tuna growth has generally been attributed to differences in oceanographic parameters e g sea temperature and prey availability e g dueri and maury 2010 and the environment and oceanic food webs that support yft vary substantially across oceans and regions pethybridge et al 2018 the availability of data sources and choice of estimation method may however also modify the growth models and affect our perception of tuna growth kolody et al 2016 in the indian ocean historical and recent studies based on multiple data sources support a marked two stanza growth pattern with a sharp acceleration in growth rate at about 60 65 cm fork length dortel et al 2015 eveson et al 2015 marsac and lablache 1985 in the atlantic ocean the two stanza growth model derived in the early 1990s from length frequency data and used for several assessments of the stock status of yft gascuel et al 1992 has been challenged by direct age estimates from counts of daily growth increments in sagittal otoliths that support a von bertalanffy growth curve shuford et al 2007 results from otolith reading however appear inconsistent with the maximum length of atlantic yft and growth rates derived from past tagging programs conducted by the international commission for the conservation of atlantic tunas calling for further studies integrating information from multiple data sources in this ocean fonteneau and chassot 2013 recent mark recapture data collected in the atlantic ocean indicate that tagged fish released with lengths of less than 65 cm tend to grow slower than expected from a von bertalanffy model while fish above 65 cm tend to grow faster a pattern modelled with a richards growth curve in the most recent assessment of atlantic yft iccat 2019 as part of the atlantic ocean tropical tuna tagging program some work is ongoing to develop an integrated growth model accounting for the new data set collected on yft growth tropical tuna growth is the major focus of current research in the pacific ocean farley et al 2018 in the western central pacific ocean the growth model used for assessing the stock of yft predicts a growth rate slowing between about 40 and 70 cm similarly to that observed in the indian ocean lehodey and leroy 1999 tremblay boyer et al 2017 changes in configuration of the yft population model also suggest some regional differences in estimated growth rates consistently with direct age estimates and mark recapture experiments tremblay boyer et al 2017 preliminary results from annual increment counts in otoliths suggest that the degree of two stanza might however be lower than previously considered farley et al 2019 in the eastern pacific ocean the stock of yft shows a more classical growth pattern than that observed in the other ocean basins minte vera et al 2020 the ageing technique based on daily increment counts for this stock has however recently been challenged farley et al 2019 ongoing research focusing on annual increments in otoliths is expected to shed the light on the growth of the two stocks of pacific yft 4 3 behavioral changes behind the two stanza growth according to the experiment of wexler et al 2003 farmed yft did not exhibit the growth acceleration occurring around 65 cm lf for wild fish similarly to the experiment of achotines the growth pattern of yft held in captivity for several years at the tuna research and conservation center trcc in pacific grove california is well described by a von bertalanffy model estess et al 2017 in this experiment yft were however found to grow significantly slower than those of the iattc experiment these observations supported that the origin of the stanza growth would rather be behavioral or ecological than physiological in captivity the food intake is adjusted to comply with the nutritional requirements of tunas which do not suffer from competition for food thus the growth stanza would be caused by a behavioral change related to feeding indeed both assumptions i e a low food availability and the consumption of less energetic prey during the juvenile stage led to a two stanza growth with growth acceleration in relation with behavioral change for a decrease in food density x from 54 to 62 or a reduction in the assimilation rates from 8 5 to 10 75 the model captured the juvenile growth but the intensity of growth acceleration and overall adult growth were underestimated in addition yft reached puberty at similar sizes as those predicted by the reference model but at older ages leading to age values in better agreement with those expected i e between 2 2 and 2 5 years according to the growth curve of indian ocean yft dortel et al 2015 several lines of evidence support low feeding rates for juveniles of yft when they occur in mixed schools associated with drifting objects in particular stomach content analysis points out to a much higher proportion of empty stomachs for fish caught from associated schools which are significantly slimmer than yft caught in free swimming schools hallier and gaertner 2008 jaquemet et al 2011 potier et al 2001 this might be explained by the high level of intra species competition and decreased foraging success in yft when they occur in large schools maury 2017 yft is an opportunistic species that feeds on a large number of prey categories and trophic studies underline a change in diet with size as well as the ability of larger yft to forage in deeper waters potier et al 2007 2004 firstly yft feed mainly on planktonic crustaceans and then from 50 cm lf they become essentially piscivorous with a decline in crustaceans consumption and a strong consumption of cephalopods between 80 100 cm maldeniya 1996 potier et al 2001 recent analysis of fatty acids and stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen showed some major ontogenetic changes in the diet of indian ocean yft sardenne et al 2016 in particular the shift in concentration of neutral fatty acids observed in the liver of yft at around 70 80 cm might reflect the change of habitat from surface to deeper layers where rich mufa prey of yft such as myctophids and their predators are more abundant sardenne et al 2016 investigating the caloric value of prey found in yft stomach contents at various size classes would be useful to quantitatively assess the energetic contribution of each prey group to the ontogenetic changes in diet 4 4 variability in yft growth most tuna stock assessments assume a constant individual growth described with some individual variability around the mean kolody et al 2016 changes in population abundance and environmental conditions may however affect growth rates over space and time as evidenced for southern bluefin tuna lorenzen 2016 polacheck et al 2004 growth parameters used for the assessment of indian ocean yft are considered constant over almost seven decades when the stock has experienced a strong decline in abundance iotc 2018 and yft fishing grounds have been characterized by major temporal changes in temperature and primary productivity roxy et al 2016 furthermore the increasing use of fads to aggregate juveniles of yft and skipjack tuna since the early 1990s might have increased intra and inter species competition and led to changes in growth rates hallier and gaertner 2008 marsac et al 2000 assessing the influence of fad density on yft growth is very difficult due to the lack of routine monitoring for ageing tunas linked to the high costs and logistics of sampling and otolith reading developing standard ageing procedures across tuna rfmos with otolith reference collections constitutes a first step to monitor changes in age length relationships and promote the comparison of tuna growth between oceans farley et al 2019 sardenne et al 2015 in addition we recommend the systematic implementation of comprehensive ageing projects in conjunction with large scale tagging programs every five or ten years to track changes in tuna growth rates and better account for growth variability in the demographic analysis of these socio economically important species 5 conclusion perspectives building on the dynamic energy budget modelling framework that mechanistically links the biology of individual organisms to abiotic drivers kooijman 2010 our model suggests that the unique growth pattern observed in wild yft could stem from a major change in intensity of schooling and associative behavior with size which would substantially modify both the quantity and quality of food available for maintenance reproduction and growth this change would be triggered by the acquisition of physiological abilities and anatomical traits with age and result in an ontogenetic shift in the biotic habitat and trophic ecology of yft in addition the intensity of schooling might depend on population abundance with higher density resulting in the formation of larger schools described by a higher degree of competition maury 2017 maury and poggiale 2013 next steps of the work will include the development of a comprehensive calibration and sensitivity analysis to identify the most influential parameters of the model and estimate the ranges of values driving different shapes of growth curves and the associated age length keys that are used for assessing the status of yft stocks to this end the data collected at trcc would be useful to estimate a comprehensive set of parameters as well as to disentangle the relative contributions of water temperature and low energy diet on the low growth rates of yft observed at trcc more generally tuna morphometric and bioenergetic data collected for scientific purpose under controlled environmental conditions are extremely difficult and costly to obtain estess et al 2017

24728,recently growing interest in the circular economy ce concept can be observed among scholars and practitioners globally one ce goal is to increase resource efficiency by converting more waste into resources the introduction of such changes in the long term perspective will have an impact on regionals economies but the exact consequences of these changes are largely unknown and require a specific modelling approach in this paper a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium dsge model designed to simulate the expected impact of increased resource efficiency on a regional economy is applied to a regional case study the model is built on the assumption that a portion of current consumption is returned to producers in the form of supplies later re used in the production process the structural parameters of the proposed model were calibrated for malopolska a region in southern poland and the study used the bayesian estimation method in this process computer simulation confirms the positive impact on the economy by the increase in resource efficiency which will eventually improve the quality of life of the region s population according to this study in the long run one additional unit of material resulting from recycling is a substitute for four units of raw material the article proposes to measure the recycling rates as a portion of recovered materials value rather than their mass with this methodology recycling estimates for the malopolska region of poland in 2017 amounts to 48 1 keywords circular economy dsge recycling waste regional economy 1 introduction the circular economy ce replaces the linear business model with the concept of an economy where the material flow is closed and goods circulate among users as rented or leased instead of owned with damaged items repaired not replaced and wastes limited to an absolute minimum geissdoerfer et al 2017 at present this idea is utopian but certain steps are being made to move in that direction we live on a planet with finite resources and a growing number of consumers moreover humanity has reached a level of development that has influenced the earth s climate and environmental pollution is a global concern mcmichael 2014 a shortage of resources has already become an imminent threat to the world s biggest raw materials consumers as a result china adopted ce as its core strategy for national development in 2008 geng et al 2012 during the last 15 years numerous ce related pilot projects were set up in china mostly in urban areas as cities have the most favorable conditions for ce model implementation xueting et al 2019 concerns over improving resource efficiency are present in europe as well welfens et al 2017 europe is focused on resource efficiency waste new business models new jobs eco innovations and social innovations mcdowall et al 2017 european cases for developing ce methodological frameworks for urban systems at local and regional levels are focused mostly on monitoring the transition process there have also been attempts to propose systems of indicators for ce monitoring avdiushchenko and zając 2019 as mentioned research has shown that monitoring based on indicators is not always enough for modeling economic changes caused by a switch to the ce model of development moreover preventing the generation of waste by converting waste into resources combined with increased resource efficiency significantly impacts the environment society and economy consequently ce requires the development of new economic processes and business models kristensen and mosgaard 2020 the most common approach to modeling the impact of ce on the economy involves quantitative models of computable general equilibrium the concept of general equilibrium makes those models most suitable for such an analysis because it is expected that some parts of the economy will benefit from changes and others will not wijkman skånberg 2015 numerous studies currently modeling the ce concept in one way or another make use of dsge or similar models kyriakopoulos et al 2019 used a multi parametric approach to analyze the functionality of technologies in wastewater treatment organic waste management agrarian development and food waste in the context of ce chan 2020 constructed a two country environmental dynamic stochastic general equilibrium e dsge model to compare the optimal carbon tax rates between countries in noncooperative and cooperative scenarios in the presence of different economic shocks on the basis of a dsge model shobande and shodipe 2019 explored the impact of energy policy in curbing the effect of carbon emissions in the united states china and nigeria hollander et al 2019 designed a small open economy new keynesian dsge model with a role for oil in consumption and production considering the multidimensional influence of ce on areas where it is implemented some current research directed special attention toward the modification of existing macroeconomic models of production and consumption existing studies use a few kinds of decoupling mechanisms researchers have most commonly introduced some variety of technological change in the production function in this approach the parameters of the production function are altered in such a way that results in better overall efficiency of production tuladhar et al 2016 the second approach was related to the term substitution substitution between materials substitution between production factors and substitution on the demand side godzinski 2015 some recent studies assumed that in the future consumers will voluntarily shift to products that are less materials intensive such endogenous alterations in consumption patterns will result in reductions in natural resource extraction meyer et al 2015 this paper focuses on the impact of the growing recycling rates of consumed materials on the economy of the malopolska region of poland in particular the impact of such changes on gross domestic product gdp and wages given that the main goal of the study is an analysis of the regional economy the idea of dividing the economy into sectors was abandoned this decision results from limited access to reliable data at the regional level data of this type is more readily available for national economies which may differ significantly from regional ones the study attempts a general approach to the issue to achieve this goal a dsge model is introduced with recursive dynamics of consumption in the economy the model assumes that part of the consumption is recovered in the form of secondary materials and is used again in the production process as consumption plays a key role in the model a distinction is made between private and public consumption additionally the consumption habit formation was implemented into the utility functions of households one should remember that theoretical models are usually based on abstract assumptions which by definition simplify reality despite these simplifications they are a useful tool for explaining selected facts and economic relationships for this reason it is not common practice to reject such ex ante models due to assumptions that are not necessarily realistic in the opinion of the researcher canova 2007 the second section below presents the malopolska region the third section covers the proposed model and the fourth section presents the results obtained the final conclusions and discussion can be found in the fifth section 2 the malopolska region the malopolska region also known as the malopolskie voivodeship or lesser poland is situated in southern poland it has an area of 15 108 square kilometers 5 833 sq mi which in terms of size ranks malopolska among the smallest regions in the country mrr 2019 the economic potential and attractiveness for investment in the region has made it one of the most prominent regions of poland this situation is also due to good transport infrastructure the region s location on international transit routes and favorable conditions for investment such as the presence of special economic zones and advanced scientific and research facilities rosem 2018 at the same time the region has some environmental problems the most serious of these is air pollution in a who report the regional capital krakow ranked 8th among 575 cities for high levels of pm 2 5 and 145th

there has been an upward trend in the amount of municipal waste collected from 0 70 million tons in 2013 to 1 07 million tons in 2018 since 2005 a systematic increase in the amount of waste collected selectively has been observed in 2018 some 35 2 of all municipal waste was collected selectively fig 1 in 2018 11 7 million tons of industrial waste was generated as a result of business activity in the malopolska region the largest stream of waste generated was non hazardous waste produced by individual sectors agriculture crafts and services recovery is the main method of waste management in the region in 2018 10 4 million tons of industrial waste was sent for recovery fig 2 the malopolska region was chosen for the preparation of a case study estimating ce progress as malopolska is one of the leading regions of poland when it comes to ce issues the regional authorities have already started the transition to a ce model a detailed analysis of ce related actions at the regional level was presented in the work of avdiushchenko 2018 3 the model the model designed for this study is a dsge model dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models arose as a response to the need to design relatively simple models describing the economy as a whole historically the basics of dsge models are derived from the work of ramsey 1927 1928 and although others also contributed to their development it was only the publication of kydland and prescot 1982 that made them an extremely popular tool for modern economic modeling dsge models combine elements of various economic theories colander 2006 while they are designed to show the relationships between variables on a macroeconomic scale they are constructed on the basis of microeconomic considerations dsge models are therefore immune to lucas criticism 1976 according to which prediction attempts and conclusions for the entire economy resulting from the use of econometric models based solely on historical data may lead to unintended or counterproductive consequences according to lucas important are the so called deep parameters that reflect consumer preferences or restrictions on raw materials or technology therefore dsge models assume that the state of the economy is determined by the so called representative agents i e firms households central bank government agents achieve their sometimes contradictory goals while maintaining certain restrictions e g budget and the state of the economy is the result of interaction between them households decide about consumption time spent on labor and how to use their capital enterprises control the volume of production decide on the prices of manufactured goods and negotiate wages for labor with households available resources are divided into primary raw materials and secondary recovered from past consumption the production function depends on capital labor and materials the government controls public consumption and sets taxes the balance is achieved when the decisions of the agents interact with each other as interest in dsge models increased naturally numerous criticisms of these models also appeared some researchers e g kirman 1992 point to problems associated with the existence of representative agents others e g chari et al 2009 challenge the sense of structural shocks in this context the sonnenschein mantel debreu theorem must also be taken into account the theorem shows that microeconomic foundations do not result in macro scale regularities hence the characteristics of individual entities do not transfer to the features of the whole economy however it should be remembered that there is no clearly superior alternative to dsge models models describing the economy are at present strongly formalized in terms of mathematical description and firmly grounded in economic theory currently two basic classes of dsge models are distinguished neoclassical models based on the assumptions of new classical economics and more complex neo keynesian models using elements of neo keynesian economics the model used in this work applies both mentioned theories the economy is in a state of equilibrium and the markets have self clearing properties as in the theories of new classical economics according to the theory of rational expectations agents make optimal decisions i e they do not systematically make the same mistakes and the production sector does not show perfect competition because there are price rigidities firms are profit oriented which is in line with neo keynesian economics the novelty and originality of the research lie in the way that material flow in the economy is modeled recycling is an important component of the flow of materials fig 3 is a block diagram describing different relationships and connections between agents in the model special attention was therefore focused on the flow of materials in the economy which is why material flows are highlighted in red the standard rbc real business cycle model doesn t include explicit material flow in the economy the closest to our work are an environmental dynamic stochastic general equilibrium e dsge models those models are used to investigate the linkages between business cycle and environmental policy due to the specificity of building a model for a relatively small region and with limited access to data our model has been designed as relatively simple with the potential to extend it with new elements 3 1 private and public consumption it is understood that consumer preferences reflect their love of variety this means that for a potential consumer not only the quantity of goods consumed but also their diversity matters aggregate consumption ct depends on the consumption of individual goods c j t it is understood that the elasticity of substitution between consumable goods is constant so the aggregate consumption is expressed by the dixit stiglitz aggregator dixit stiglitz 1977 which is in the form of the ces constant elasticity of substitution function 1 c t 0 1 c j t θ 1 θ d j θ θ 1 where θ 1 stands for elasticity of substitution let pt specify the aggregate price index for goods available on the market at time t while p j t determine the price of good j time t the desired property here is that p t c t 0 1 p j t c j t d j accordingly it can be shown that 2 p t 0 1 p j t 1 θ d j 1 1 θ it is worth noting that the function determining the aggregated price index is again a ces function defining pt this way leads to a formula for the demand of individual households for good j gali 2008 3 c j t ρ j t θ c t where 4 ρ j t p j t p t is the relative price of good j at time t individual price divided by price index the presented model takes into account the breakdown of aggregate consumption ct into private consumption c p t and public consumption c g t according to empirical studies public consumption is an important component of overall consumption expenditure in the economy and its changes significantly affect the behavior of other economic indicators blanchard and perotti 2002 it is also assumed that consumer preferences of the public sphere are the same as the consumer preferences of households therefore aggregate consumption in the economy is the sum of private and public consumption 5 c t c p t c g t 3 2 firms the model rejects the assumption of perfect competition therefore it is assumed that firms set prices of produced goods in such a way as to make a profit and not only compensate for the production costs as in the neoclassical models let y j t denote the production volume of good j while aggregate production in the economy should be marked as yt the dixit stiglitz formula for the aggregate price index p t 0 1 p j t 1 θ d j 1 1 θ implies a formula for aggregate production 6 y t 0 1 y j t θ 1 θ d j θ θ 1 this leads to a relationship between the production volume of good j and aggregate production using the relative price of good j 7 y j t ρ j t θ y t while planning production firms have to deal with the problem of optimal price determination using the available resources of physical capital k j t labor l j t and materials m j t enterprises in the production process are homogeneous in terms of the production technology used and use the multi factor cobb douglas production functions for it 8 y j t m j t k j t α l j t 1 α φ where φ is the parameter corresponding to fixed costs while α is the elasticity of output with respect to labor and capital 0 α 1 the introduction of fixed costs into the model means increasing returns to scale occur but if it is assumed that φ 0 then as a result the model will show constant returns to scale companies optimize production factors in two stages at the first stage the optimal price for the goods produced is determined at the second stage companies take wage wt and return rates of capital rt and determine the demand for labor and physical capital which will minimize production costs 3 2

the goods they produce the maximization of profit is a result of the following problem 15 max l j t k j t p j t y j t w t l j t r t k j t in order to solve 15 one needs to use equations 7 and 14 first order condition is given by 16 p j t θ θ 1 c m t the above equation represents the difference between the price and marginal cost in the model normalizing the price of the final good to unity with the assumption that firms are identical leads to 17 c m t θ 1 θ moreover the marginal cost is below unity for θ 1 3 3 households households strive to maximize their utility function which depends on private consumption and the amount of free time private consumption is inextricably linked to public consumption it is assumed here that the utility of individual household consumption is a linear combination of private consumption c p t and public consumption c g t mcgrattan 1994 18 c t u c p t π c g t the π parameter represents the constant elasticity of substitution between the available types of consumption therefore if π 0 public consumption affects the consumer s utility function for π 0 with the increase in public consumption the marginal utility of consumption decreases for π 0 the opposite is true using var vector autoregression class models perotti 2008 showed that for us data an increase in public consumption affects private consumption on the other hand mcgrattan 1994 obtained the opposite result in addition to the distinction between private and public consumption the model assumes that consumers are guided by habit formation in their choices campbell and cochrane 1999 indicated that consumption habits naturally result from human psychological conditions including consumption habits in the study allows for better modeling of consumption sensitivity due to changes in the level of income as well as helps to better understand the possible negative correlation between rates of return and future levels of production boldin et al 2001 for the model used in the current research it is assumed that current consumption depends on consumption from the previous period torres 2013 therefore the utility function of the household does not depend on the actual consumption itself but on the difference between current consumption and consumption habits from the previous period i e c t u ϕ c t 1 u where ϕ is a constant reflecting the strength of consumption habits 0 ϕ 1 as a result the household s utility resulting from the consumption stream is greater the greater the difference between current and benchmark consumption the utility function for households next to the difference in present consumption and consumption related to consumer habits c t u ϕ c t 1 u as an argument takes leisure time ot the household utility function is increasing relative to its factors its functional form used in this paper is 19 u t c t u ϕ c t 1 u o t γ ln c t u ϕ c t 1 u 1 γ ln o t where 0 γ 1 is a parameter that is responsible for the weighting of consumption and free time the household must decide how to divide the available time between leisure time ot and time allocated for labor lt 20 o t l t 1 o t 1 l t increasing the time spent on labor is associated with obtaining income and thus increasing the volume of consumption on the other hand increasing the amount of time spent on labor results in a reduction in the amount of free time which is why households are looking for the golden mean between both households maximize the value of the expected stream of utility functions therefore the sum of usability at the present time and the currently expected future values of usability functions which are discounted using the parameter 0 β 1 is maximized 21 e t t 0 β t u t c t u ϕ c t 1 u o t the household budget is balanced in the sense

important role in ge general equilibrium models their role is to optimize consumption and time spent on labor in addition the way they invest their savings depends on their decisions households decide how much of the funds to spend on capital investments and how much for investments in companies the lagrange problem that households solve is reduced to max l c p t l t k t e t t 0 β t γ log c p t π c

to redistribution of state revenues we assume that the government uses tax revenues for public spending on goods and services it is assumed that government consumption preferences are the same as household preferences in addition the government s expenses are balanced in each period the government collects resources by taxing consumption and income arising from labor and returns on capital effective tax rates are denoted by τ c t τ l t and τ k t respectively the government budget can be expressed as 27 c g t τ c c t τ l w t l t τ k r t δ k k t ε t g where ε t g represents a shock

dynamics associated with the relationship between present and delayed endogenous variables and delayed current and expected exogenous variables and shocks a common practice to deal with non linearity of equations is to approximate the model linearly in the first stage a solution is sought that illustrates the state of long term balance the so called steady state in practice this boils down to finding a solution to the model in a simplified situation where model variables do not depend on time and shocks do not occur the second step is the log linearization of the model after log linearization the dsge model takes the form of a differential equation with the expectations 32 a e t y t 1 b y t c ε t where y t is a vector of endogenous model variables after log linearization e t y t 1 is a vector of the future expected values of endogenous model variables after log linearization ɛt is a vector of random disturbances while a b c are numerical matrices in order to solve the model the algorithm proposed by blanchard and kahn 1980 is used 4 4 the blanchard and kahn theorem 1980 says that the necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of an unambiguous solution to the model is the equality between the number of unstable greater than 1 in absolute value eigenvalues of the a and b matrices and the number of forward looking variables model parameters are most often estimated using the mle maximum likelihood estimation method or bayesian estimation in bayesian estimation knowledge about parameter values comes partly from empirical data and partly from the researcher s subjective assessment of the possible distribution of a parameter treated as a random variable such a subjective arbitrarily determined distribution is called a priori distribution the process of parameter estimation in practice is based on the confrontation of the established a priori distribution with the data as a result this leads to the so called a posteriori distribution the usage of a priori distributions brings various benefits using dsge models for empirical research is often associated with problems resulting from limited access to data hence additional information in the form of a priori distribution is extremely valuable it even allows you to block parameters from adopting values that make no sense from the point of view of economics and which can cause a violation of blanchard kahn conditions the last stage of bayesian estimation is determining a posteriori distributions for model parameters because is not possible to determine marginal distributions in an analytical manner the problem is again solved numerically the metropolis hastings algorithm metropolis et al 1953 hastings 1970 approximates in an iterative way the a posteriori marginal distributions the algorithm randomizes the starting values for parameters from a priori distributions and then changes their values moving along the path determined by the markov chain which converges to the a posteriori distribution in each iteration the metropolis hastings algorithm randomizes the parameter values and rejects them with some probability determining this probability requires among other things the use of a kalman filter each time this results in the fact that the entire operation requires a significant number of repetitions and is very time consuming while the algorithm itself is included in the mcmc markov chain monte carlo methods the number of iterations of the mh algorithm is determined each time in advance by the researcher however due to the fact that it is a monte carlo type algorithm it has become accepted in empirical studies to set the number of iterations at the level of one million in addition it is recommended to repeat the whole operation in several blocks the blocks differ from each other only in the starting values obtained randomly from the prior distributions ultimately the desirable feature is that the results obtained in the individual blocks are convergent to make the results of the estimation independent from the randomly selected first parameter values it is good practice to reject a certain group of initial implementations for this paper the burning rate was set at 25 4 1 dataset the model contains four structural shocks therefore four macroeconomic variables related to the malopolska region are used to estimate its parameters these are gdp pln capital investments pln return rates from capital and average monthly gross salary pln furthermore gdp capital investments and average monthly gross salary were adjusted for inflation and measured with constant prices due to limited access to historical data on selected variables the authors decided to work on quarterly data from the years 2008 2017 in this study which yielded a total of 40 observations for each of these variables as a rule dsge class models do not take into account seasonal fluctuations the assumption regarding the existence of equilibrium in the economy results in the need to neutralize any empirically observable trend in addition one should remember that the log linearization variables are interpreted as a deviation from the equilibrium state therefore before proceeding to the estimation of model parameters the data should be properly prepared ultimately the desirable feature is that observable variables are stationary so they should be deprived of their potential seasonality and trend in the first stage the empirical series were deprived of the seasonal component for this purpose x 12 arima filtration was used findley et al 1998 i e a procedure created and widely used by among others the us census bureau identification of trends occurring in empirical data was made using a hodrick prescott filter with a standard smoothing constant value for quarterly data λ 1600 the variables used in estimating the dsge model parameters are therefore in practice deviations of the values obtained using x 12 arima filtration from the trend obtained using the hodrick prescott filter 4 2 bayesian estimation determining the dsge model parameter values usually takes place in two stages in the first part the parameters are calibrated and in the second the values of other parameters are estimated using bayesian techniques the parameters corresponding to the amount of taxes in poland and the δrm factor were calibrated table 3 and the remaining parameters were estimated by bayesian estimation for the remaining parameters of the model an attempt was made to generate a posteriori distribution based on an arbitrarily determined a priori distribution fig 4 a priori distributions are assumed to have relatively large variances and are independent of each other while the marginal posterior parameter distributions obtained on the basis of numerical calculations should have low variance and thus a clear concentration of the distribution around the dominant values the sample from a posteriori distributions is obtained using the iterative metropolis hastings algorithm five markov chains were used to estimate marginal distributions using monte carlo methods each of which consisted of one million replications for which the burning rate was set at 25 therefore the first 250 000 implementations were rejected the average values for a priori distributions table 4 as well as the values of calibrated parameters were taken from other dsge models torres 2013 christiano et al 2005 analysis of the obtained results focused only on the parameters related to the flow of materials in the economy the first to notice is the parameter ϑ representing the constant elasticity of substitution between raw materials and materials recovered from consumption the value obtained is close to ¼ therefore the model indicates that in the long run one additional unit of materials resulting from recycling is a substitute for four units of raw material assuming constant demand for materials in the economy the second to notice is parameter δmc describing what part of consumption is recovered in the form of materials the model estimated the value of the parameter at 48 1 which means that 48 of consumption is recycled during interpretation one should remember that this is a value and not a quantity of recovered materials 4 3 impulse response functions the impulse response functions irf allow observation of the reaction of the economy in response to the model s structural shocks the assumption is that the economy is in a state of equilibrium when the shock occurs and no other external change takes place after the shock in response to the impulse the economy returns asymptotically to a state of equilibrium the shocks themselves are also not big they are usually set at one percent this section analyzes the economy s response to increasing the recycling rates fig 5 the length of the time window in which the impulse response function is observed has been set to forty periods remembering that the model works on quarterly data this corresponds to a period of ten years increasing the value of materials recovered from consumption has a positive effect on producers who as a result can produce more goods gdp growth is a natural consequence of this state of affairs since relative prices are not immediately corrected an increase in production results in an increase in enterprises profits and thus an increase in the level of remuneration households will use the surplus in the budget to increase consumption and net investments in capital a sudden increase in investments results in a decrease in their profitability 5 conclusions and discussion the circular economy concept depends on preserving the value of materials as environmental protection has become an important aspect of regional policy in malopolska the presented research attempts to answer the question of how converting waste into resources might impact the regional economy the difficulty in compiling the necessary empirical database has resulted in a situation where the environmental policy feedback mechanism still hasn t been fully integrated into ge models consequently a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model with an implemented resource recovery mechanism was constructed the parameters of the model were estimated on the basis of quarterly data from the period 2008 2017 as a result it was possible to prepare reliable estimates and confidence intervals for simulations this exercise revealed that in the long run one additional unit of material resulting from recycling is a substitute for four units of raw material assuming constant demand for materials in the economy this is an interesting result proving the profitability of closing the gap in the circulation of materials by increasing the amount of waste for reprocessing into products materials or substances whether for its original or other purposes the model also estimated the monetary value of recovered consumption understood here as recycling at 48 1 of the original materials value in 2017 eurostat estimated the average recycling rate of municipal waste in all 27 countries at 46 6 in most countries wastes were measured by tonnage but differences appear in the definitions of what was classified as municipal waste and in the calculation methods employed regional statistics are not available but poland s nationwide estimate was 35 2 in this context the recycling definition by value appears as a new and interesting option the source of economic fluctuations in dsge models are shocks therefore special attention was focused on shocks related to the increase in the amount of available materials resulting from the recovered resources the presented simulations show that an increase in the amount of materials resulting from an increase in the level of recovery leads to economic growth the wages and investments in the capital will increase but as a result return rates from the capital will drop the waste framework directive eu 2018 set a target of 50 of municipal waste to be reused and recycled in member states by 2020 the targets for the future were set to increase reuse and recycling of municipal waste to at least 55 of municipal waste by 2025 60 by 2030 and 65 by 2035 our research thus provides arguments to encourage this approach to environmental politics in the future this research has shown numerous resource efficiency benefits from ce implementation for the regional economy however the ce concept is much wider than only resource and waste management issues so implementing ce into regional development strategies also influences other regional development areas that improve the quality of life of the population hartley et al 2020 in discussing the positive influence of ce in the context of the sustainable development of regions additional attention should be paid to the environmental business and technology socio economic and spatial management benefits positive environmental impacts could be seen in the following areas utilization of raw materials commercial and industrial feedstock carbon sequestration environmental pollution reuse of goods and equipment refurbishment and remanufacturing water reuse and biodiversity support prieto sandoval et al 2018 regarding business and technology ce implementation at the regional level could stimulate the development of technologies to further upgrade waste processing into a more efficient resource increase compatibility and technological symbiosis among technologies encourage business development based on ce business models provide protection for businesses against the scarcity of resources and volatile prices bring about new ce products and services and result in energy savings as reformed production processes require less energy lewandowski 2016 the most numerous grouping of positive changes is expected to be found in the socio economic area where ce ideas could result in green based economic growth an increase in economic performance ce oriented fiscal policy and reduced reliance on raw materials imports in addition there could be benefits related to increasing social awareness about environmental issues opportunities for local green jobs and social integration ce social innovation stimulation a new model of collaboration among regional stakeholders a positive influence on human health the emergence of ce consumption patterns services instead of products moving from ownership to leasing ce sharing services development and ce social entrepreneurship kalmykova et al 2018 the final group of positive factors of ce development are the spatial management benefits the emergence of ce zones industrial and urban symbiosis systems in a region ce transport infrastructure solutions sharing services development of public transport infrastructure and ce regional policy providing more opportunities to create public spaces that encourage citizens to cooperate and develop social innovations leising et al 2018 the above mentioned potential benefits constitute opportunities for sustainable regional development and improving quality of life thus future research should be focused on modeling and investigating the wider influence of ce on regional development areas and identifying the interrelations between them 6 author contributions conceptualization p z and a a methodology p

24728,recently growing interest in the circular economy ce concept can be observed among scholars and practitioners globally one ce goal is to increase resource efficiency by converting more waste into resources the introduction of such changes in the long term perspective will have an impact on regionals economies but the exact consequences of these changes are largely unknown and require a specific modelling approach in this paper a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium dsge model designed to simulate the expected impact of increased resource efficiency on a regional economy is applied to a regional case study the model is built on the assumption that a portion of current consumption is returned to producers in the form of supplies later re used in the production process the structural parameters of the proposed model were calibrated for malopolska a region in southern poland and the study used the bayesian estimation method in this process computer simulation confirms the positive impact on the economy by the increase in resource efficiency which will eventually improve the quality of life of the region s population according to this study in the long run one additional unit of material resulting from recycling is a substitute for four units of raw material the article proposes to measure the recycling rates as a portion of recovered materials value rather than their mass with this methodology recycling estimates for the malopolska region of poland in 2017 amounts to 48 1 keywords circular economy dsge recycling waste regional economy 1 introduction the circular economy ce replaces the linear business model with the concept of an economy where the material flow is closed and goods circulate among users as rented or leased instead of owned with damaged items repaired not replaced and wastes limited to an absolute minimum geissdoerfer et al 2017 at present this idea is utopian but certain steps are being made to move in that direction we live on a planet with finite resources and a growing number of consumers moreover humanity has reached a level of development that has influenced the earth s climate and environmental pollution is a global concern mcmichael 2014 a shortage of resources has already become an imminent threat to the world s biggest raw materials consumers as a result china adopted ce as its core strategy for national development in 2008 geng et al 2012 during the last 15 years numerous ce related pilot projects were set up in china mostly in urban areas as cities have the most favorable conditions for ce model implementation xueting et al 2019 concerns over improving resource efficiency are present in europe as well welfens et al 2017 europe is focused on resource efficiency waste new business models new jobs eco innovations and social innovations mcdowall et al 2017 european cases for developing ce methodological frameworks for urban systems at local and regional levels are focused mostly on monitoring the transition process there have also been attempts to propose systems of indicators for ce monitoring avdiushchenko and zając 2019 as mentioned research has shown that monitoring based on indicators is not always enough for modeling economic changes caused by a switch to the ce model of development moreover preventing the generation of waste by converting waste into resources combined with increased resource efficiency significantly impacts the environment society and economy consequently ce requires the development of new economic processes and business models kristensen and mosgaard 2020 the most common approach to modeling the impact of ce on the economy involves quantitative models of computable general equilibrium the concept of general equilibrium makes those models most suitable for such an analysis because it is expected that some parts of the economy will benefit from changes and others will not wijkman skånberg 2015 numerous studies currently modeling the ce concept in one way or another make use of dsge or similar models kyriakopoulos et al 2019 used a multi parametric approach to analyze the functionality of technologies in wastewater treatment organic waste management agrarian development and food waste in the context of ce chan 2020 constructed a two country environmental dynamic stochastic general equilibrium e dsge model to compare the optimal carbon tax rates between countries in noncooperative and cooperative scenarios in the presence of different economic shocks on the basis of a dsge model shobande and shodipe 2019 explored the impact of energy policy in curbing the effect of carbon emissions in the united states china and nigeria hollander et al 2019 designed a small open economy new keynesian dsge model with a role for oil in consumption and production considering the multidimensional influence of ce on areas where it is implemented some current research directed special attention toward the modification of existing macroeconomic models of production and consumption existing studies use a few kinds of decoupling mechanisms researchers have most commonly introduced some variety of technological change in the production function in this approach the parameters of the production function are altered in such a way that results in better overall efficiency of production tuladhar et al 2016 the second approach was related to the term substitution substitution between materials substitution between production factors and substitution on the demand side godzinski 2015 some recent studies assumed that in the future consumers will voluntarily shift to products that are less materials intensive such endogenous alterations in consumption patterns will result in reductions in natural resource extraction meyer et al 2015 this paper focuses on the impact of the growing recycling rates of consumed materials on the economy of the malopolska region of poland in particular the impact of such changes on gross domestic product gdp and wages given that the main goal of the study is an analysis of the regional economy the idea of dividing the economy into sectors was abandoned this decision results from limited access to reliable data at the regional level data of this type is more readily available for national economies which may differ significantly from regional ones the study attempts a general approach to the issue to achieve this goal a dsge model is introduced with recursive dynamics of consumption in the economy the model assumes that part of the consumption is recovered in the form of secondary materials and is used again in the production process as consumption plays a key role in the model a distinction is made between private and public consumption additionally the consumption habit formation was implemented into the utility functions of households one should remember that theoretical models are usually based on abstract assumptions which by definition simplify reality despite these simplifications they are a useful tool for explaining selected facts and economic relationships for this reason it is not common practice to reject such ex ante models due to assumptions that are not necessarily realistic in the opinion of the researcher canova 2007 the second section below presents the malopolska region the third section covers the proposed model and the fourth section presents the results obtained the final conclusions and discussion can be found in the fifth section 2 the malopolska region the malopolska region also known as the malopolskie voivodeship or lesser poland is situated in southern poland it has an area of 15 108 square kilometers 5 833 sq mi which in terms of size ranks malopolska among the smallest regions in the country mrr 2019 the economic potential and attractiveness for investment in the region has made it one of the most prominent regions of poland this situation is also due to good transport infrastructure the region s location on international transit routes and favorable conditions for investment such as the presence of special economic zones and advanced scientific and research facilities rosem 2018 at the same time the region has some environmental problems the most serious of these is air pollution in a who report the regional capital krakow ranked 8th among 575 cities for high levels of pm 2 5 and 145th among 1 100 cities for levels of pm 10 the problem of high air pollution spans the whole malopolska region who 2016 2 1 population in 2018 the region had a population of 3 4 million 8 9 of the country s population with a population density of 224 persons per square kilometer a total of 1 6 million people lived in urban areas the population structure by sex indicated the dominance of women in the region with a feminization rate of 106 in recent years a significant increase in the number of post working age people has been observed table 1 this growth is quite dynamic and it is expected that it will progress even more in the coming years 2 2 economic activity in 2018 a total of 0 39 million new firms were registered in malopolska with average 3 annual growth this constituted 9 of the total number of entities in the country 4 46 million in terms of density 115 enterprises were registered per thousand inhabitants approximately 30 of all firms are registered in the region s largest city krakow in terms of economic sectors the dominant position was held by trade related enterprises wholesale and retail section g 21 9 construction section f 14 5 and professional scientific and technical activities section m 10 3 the smallest share was recorded for the following sectors public administration and national defense compulsory social security section o water supply sewerage and waste management and remediation activities section e mining and quarrying section b and electricity supply section d malopolska s greatest economic contribution relative to the country as a whole i e above 10 0 were the construction section f and accommodation and services catering section i sectors the lowest value of a given indicator was recorded in the cases of agricultural activities section a and electricity supply section d in both cases below 5 5 in 2018 the value of regional gdp amounted to pln 159 997 million in gdp expressed in purchasing power standard pps per capita the malopolskie voivodship reached the level of 63 of the eu average this put the region in 6th place in the country malopolska held the leading position nationally in terms of the gerd gdp 1 1 gerd gdp stands for gross domestic expenditure on research and development gerd as a percentage of gross domestic product gdp gerd gdp is the total intramural expenditure on research and development r d performed in the national territory during a specific reference period expressed as a percentage of gdp of the national territory intensity ratio 1 85 while the berd gdp 2 2 berd gdp stands for business enterprise r d expenditure berd as a percentage of gdp ratio 1 17 placed the region second after the mazowieckie region mrr 2019 2 3 labor market in 2018 the region had a low unemployment rate of 4 7 the average employment in the malopolskie voivodship has been gradually increasing since 2014 average employment increased in scientific and engineering activities by 10 4 transport and warehousing by 8 8 as well as in information and communication by 7 2 at the same time there was a decline in average employment in mining and quarrying by 7 6 and real estate market services by 2 0 in 2018 the average gross monthly salary in the business sector amounted to pln 5 025 1 179 euro 8 8 more than in the previous year the highest salary increases 14 1 were recorded in mining and quarrying mrr 2019 2 4 waste waste statistics for the region show that 1 07 million tons of municipal waste was collected in malopolska in 2018 including 0 93 million tons from households since 2013 there has been an upward trend in the amount of municipal waste collected from 0 70 million tons in 2013 to 1 07 million tons in 2018 since 2005 a systematic increase in the amount of waste collected selectively has been observed in 2018 some 35 2 of all municipal waste was collected selectively fig 1 in 2018 11 7 million tons of industrial waste was generated as a result of business activity in the malopolska region the largest stream of waste generated was non hazardous waste produced by individual sectors agriculture crafts and services recovery is the main method of waste management in the region in 2018 10 4 million tons of industrial waste was sent for recovery fig 2 the malopolska region was chosen for the preparation of a case study estimating ce progress as malopolska is one of the leading regions of poland when it comes to ce issues the regional authorities have already started the transition to a ce model a detailed analysis of ce related actions at the regional level was presented in the work of avdiushchenko 2018 3 the model the model designed for this study is a dsge model dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models arose as a response to the need to design relatively simple models describing the economy as a whole historically the basics of dsge models are derived from the work of ramsey 1927 1928 and although others also contributed to their development it was only the publication of kydland and prescot 1982 that made them an extremely popular tool for modern economic modeling dsge models combine elements of various economic theories colander 2006 while they are designed to show the relationships between variables on a macroeconomic scale they are constructed on the basis of microeconomic considerations dsge models are therefore immune to lucas criticism 1976 according to which prediction attempts and conclusions for the entire economy resulting from the use of econometric models based solely on historical data may lead to unintended or counterproductive consequences according to lucas important are the so called deep parameters that reflect consumer preferences or restrictions on raw materials or technology therefore dsge models assume that the state of the economy is determined by the so called representative agents i e firms households central bank government agents achieve their sometimes contradictory goals while maintaining certain restrictions e g budget and the state of the economy is the result of interaction between them households decide about consumption time spent on labor and how to use their capital enterprises control the volume of production decide on the prices of manufactured goods and negotiate wages for labor with households available resources are divided into primary raw materials and secondary recovered from past consumption the production function depends on capital labor and materials the government controls public consumption and sets taxes the balance is achieved when the decisions of the agents interact with each other as interest in dsge models increased naturally numerous criticisms of these models also appeared some researchers e g kirman 1992 point to problems associated with the existence of representative agents others e g chari et al 2009 challenge the sense of structural shocks in this context the sonnenschein mantel debreu theorem must also be taken into account the theorem shows that microeconomic foundations do not result in macro scale regularities hence the characteristics of individual entities do not transfer to the features of the whole economy however it should be remembered that there is no clearly superior alternative to dsge models models describing the economy are at present strongly formalized in terms of mathematical description and firmly grounded in economic theory currently two basic classes of dsge models are distinguished neoclassical models based on the assumptions of new classical economics and more complex neo keynesian models using elements of neo keynesian economics the model used in this work applies both mentioned theories the economy is in a state of equilibrium and the markets have self clearing properties as in the theories of new classical economics according to the theory of rational expectations agents make optimal decisions i e they do not systematically make the same mistakes and the production sector does not show perfect competition because there are price rigidities firms are profit oriented which is in line with neo keynesian economics the novelty and originality of the research lie in the way that material flow in the economy is modeled recycling is an important component of the flow of materials fig 3 is a block diagram describing different relationships and connections between agents in the model special attention was therefore focused on the flow of materials in the economy which is why material flows are highlighted in red the standard rbc real business cycle model doesn t include explicit material flow in the economy the closest to our work are an environmental dynamic stochastic general equilibrium e dsge models those models are used to investigate the linkages between business cycle and environmental policy due to the specificity of building a model for a relatively small region and with limited access to data our model has been designed as relatively simple with the potential to extend it with new elements 3 1 private and public consumption it is understood that consumer preferences reflect their love of variety this means that for a potential consumer not only the quantity of goods consumed but also their diversity matters aggregate consumption ct depends on the consumption of individual goods c j t it is understood that the elasticity of substitution between consumable goods is constant so the aggregate consumption is expressed by the dixit stiglitz aggregator dixit stiglitz 1977 which is in the form of the ces constant elasticity of substitution function 1 c t 0 1 c j t θ 1 θ d j θ θ 1 where θ 1 stands for elasticity of substitution let pt specify the aggregate price index for goods available on the market at time t while p j t determine the price of good j time t the desired property here is that p t c t 0 1 p j t c j t d j accordingly it can be shown that 2 p t 0 1 p j t 1 θ d j 1 1 θ it is worth noting that the function determining the aggregated price index is again a ces function defining pt this way leads to a formula for the demand of individual households for good j gali 2008 3 c j t ρ j t θ c t where 4 ρ j t p j t p t is the relative price of good j at time t individual price divided by price index the presented model takes into account the breakdown of aggregate consumption ct into private consumption c p t and public consumption c g t according to empirical studies public consumption is an important component of overall consumption expenditure in the economy and its changes significantly affect the behavior of other economic indicators blanchard and perotti 2002 it is also assumed that consumer preferences of the public sphere are the same as the consumer preferences of households therefore aggregate consumption in the economy is the sum of private and public consumption 5 c t c p t c g t 3 2 firms the model rejects the assumption of perfect competition therefore it is assumed that firms set prices of produced goods in such a way as to make a profit and not only compensate for the production costs as in the neoclassical models let y j t denote the production volume of good j while aggregate production in the economy should be marked as yt the dixit stiglitz formula for the aggregate price index p t 0 1 p j t 1 θ d j 1 1 θ implies a formula for aggregate production 6 y t 0 1 y j t θ 1 θ d j θ θ 1 this leads to a relationship between the production volume of good j and aggregate production using the relative price of good j 7 y j t ρ j t θ y t while planning production firms have to deal with the problem of optimal price determination using the available resources of physical capital k j t labor l j t and materials m j t enterprises in the production process are homogeneous in terms of the production technology used and use the multi factor cobb douglas production functions for it 8 y j t m j t k j t α l j t 1 α φ where φ is the parameter corresponding to fixed costs while α is the elasticity of output with respect to labor and capital 0 α 1 the introduction of fixed costs into the model means increasing returns to scale occur but if it is assumed that φ 0 then as a result the model will show constant returns to scale companies optimize production factors in two stages at the first stage the optimal price for the goods produced is determined at the second stage companies take wage wt and return rates of capital rt and determine the demand for labor and physical capital which will minimize production costs 3 2 1 first stage in the first stage firms minimize costs of production 9 min l j t k j t w t l j t r t k j t with the production technology used 10 y j t m j t k j t α l j t 1 α φ this leads to lagrange

conditions are 12 r t α c m t y j t k j t 13 w t 1 α c m t y j t l j t which leads to 14 w t l j t r t k j t c m t y j t 3 2 2 second stage in the second stage firms aim to setup optimal prices for the goods they produce the maximization of profit is a result of the following problem 15 max l j t k j t p j t y j t w t l j t r t k j t in order to solve 15 one needs to use equations 7 and 14 first order condition is given by 16 p j t θ θ 1 c m t the above equation represents the difference between the price and marginal cost in the model normalizing the price of the final good to unity with the assumption that firms are identical leads to 17 c m t θ 1 θ moreover the marginal cost is below unity for θ 1 3 3 households households strive to maximize their utility function which depends on private consumption and the amount of free time private consumption is inextricably linked to public consumption it is assumed here that the utility of individual household consumption is a linear combination of private consumption c p t and public consumption c g t mcgrattan 1994 18 c t u c p t π c g t the π parameter represents the constant elasticity of substitution between the available types of consumption therefore if π 0 public consumption affects the consumer s utility function for π 0 with the increase in public consumption the marginal utility of consumption decreases for π 0 the opposite is true using var vector autoregression class models perotti 2008 showed that for us data an increase in public consumption affects private consumption on the other hand mcgrattan 1994 obtained the opposite result in addition to the distinction between private and public consumption the model assumes that consumers are guided by habit formation in their choices campbell and cochrane 1999 indicated that consumption habits naturally result from human psychological conditions including consumption habits in the study allows for better modeling of consumption sensitivity due to changes in the level of income as well as helps to better understand the possible negative correlation between rates of return and future levels of production boldin et al 2001 for the model used in the current research it is assumed that current consumption depends on consumption from the previous period torres 2013 therefore the utility function of the household does not depend on the actual consumption itself but on the difference between current consumption and consumption habits from the previous period i e c t u ϕ c t 1 u where ϕ is a constant reflecting the strength of consumption habits 0 ϕ 1 as a result the household s utility resulting from the consumption stream is greater the greater the difference between current and benchmark consumption the utility function for households next to the difference in present consumption and consumption related to consumer habits c t u ϕ c t 1 u as an argument takes leisure time ot the household utility function is increasing relative to its factors its functional form used in this paper is 19 u t c t u ϕ c t 1 u o t γ ln c t u ϕ c t 1 u 1 γ ln o t where 0 γ 1 is a parameter that is responsible for the weighting of consumption and free time the household must decide how to divide the available time between leisure time ot and time allocated for labor lt 20 o t l t 1 o t 1 l t increasing the time spent on labor is associated with obtaining income and thus increasing the volume of consumption on the other hand increasing the amount of time spent on labor results in a reduction in the amount of free time which is why households are looking for the golden mean between both households maximize the value of the expected stream of utility functions therefore the sum of usability at the present time and the currently expected future values of usability functions which are discounted using the parameter 0 β 1 is maximized 21 e t t 0 β t u t c t u ϕ c t 1 u o t the household budget is balanced in the sense

important role in ge general equilibrium models their role is to optimize consumption and time spent on labor in addition the way they invest their savings depends on their decisions households decide

to redistribution of state revenues we assume that the government uses tax revenues for public spending on goods and services it is assumed that government consumption preferences are the same as household preferences in addition the government s expenses are balanced in each period the government collects resources by taxing consumption and income arising from labor and returns on capital effective tax rates are denoted by τ c t τ l t and τ k t respectively the government budget can be expressed as 27 c g t τ c c t τ l w t l t τ k r t δ k k t ε t g where ε t g represents a shock

dynamics associated with the relationship between present and delayed endogenous variables and delayed current and expected exogenous variables and shocks a common practice to deal with non linearity of equations is to approximate the model linearly in the first stage a solution is sought that illustrates the state of long term balance the so called steady state in practice this boils down to finding a solution to the model in a simplified situation where model variables do not depend on time and shocks do not occur the second step is the log linearization of the model after log linearization the dsge model takes the form of a differential equation with the expectations 32 a e t y t 1 b y t c ε t where y t is a vector of endogenous model variables after log linearization e t y t 1 is a vector of the future expected values of endogenous model variables after log linearization ɛt is a vector of random disturbances while a b c are numerical matrices in order to solve the model the algorithm proposed by blanchard and kahn 1980 is used 4 4 the blanchard and kahn theorem 1980 says that the necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of an unambiguous solution to the model is the equality between the number of unstable greater than 1 in absolute value eigenvalues of the a and b matrices and the number of forward looking variables model parameters are most often estimated using the mle maximum likelihood estimation method or bayesian estimation in bayesian estimation knowledge about parameter values comes partly from empirical data and partly from the researcher s subjective assessment of the possible distribution of a parameter treated as a random variable such a subjective arbitrarily determined distribution is called a priori distribution the process of parameter estimation in practice is based on the confrontation of the established a priori distribution with the data as a result this leads to the so called a posteriori distribution the usage of a priori distributions brings various benefits using dsge models for empirical research is often associated with problems resulting from limited access to data hence additional information in the form of a priori distribution is extremely valuable it even allows you to block parameters from adopting values that make no sense from the point of view of economics and which can cause a violation of blanchard kahn conditions the last stage of bayesian estimation is determining a posteriori distributions for model parameters because is not possible to determine marginal distributions in an analytical manner the problem is again solved numerically the metropolis hastings algorithm metropolis et al 1953 hastings 1970 approximates in an iterative way the a posteriori marginal distributions the algorithm randomizes the starting values for parameters from a priori distributions and then changes their values moving along the path determined by the markov chain which converges to the a posteriori distribution in each iteration the metropolis hastings algorithm randomizes the parameter values and rejects them with some probability determining this probability requires among other things the use of a kalman filter each time this results in the fact that the entire operation requires a significant number of repetitions and is very time consuming while the algorithm itself is included in the mcmc markov chain monte carlo methods the number of iterations of the mh algorithm is determined each time in advance by the researcher however due to the fact that it is a monte carlo type algorithm it has become accepted in empirical studies to set the number of iterations at the level of one million in addition it is recommended to repeat the whole operation in several blocks the blocks differ from each other only in the starting values obtained randomly from the prior distributions ultimately the desirable feature is that the results obtained in the individual blocks are convergent to make the results of the estimation independent from the randomly selected first parameter values it is good practice to reject a certain group of initial implementations for this paper the burning rate was set at 25 4 1 dataset the model contains four structural shocks therefore four macroeconomic variables related to the malopolska region are used to estimate its parameters these are gdp pln capital investments pln return rates from capital and average monthly gross salary pln furthermore gdp capital investments and average monthly gross salary were adjusted for inflation and measured with constant prices due to limited access to historical data on selected variables the authors decided to work on quarterly data from the years 2008 2017 in this study which yielded a total of 40 observations for each of these variables as a rule dsge class models do not take into account seasonal fluctuations the assumption regarding the existence of equilibrium in the economy results in the need to neutralize any empirically observable trend in addition one should remember that the log linearization variables are interpreted as a deviation from the equilibrium state therefore before proceeding to the estimation of model parameters the data should be properly prepared ultimately the desirable feature is that observable variables are stationary so they should be deprived of their potential seasonality and trend in the first stage the empirical series were deprived of the seasonal component for this purpose x 12 arima filtration was used findley et al 1998 i e a procedure created and widely used by among others the us census bureau identification of trends occurring in empirical data was made using a hodrick prescott filter with a standard smoothing constant value for quarterly data λ 1600 the variables used in estimating the dsge model parameters are therefore in practice deviations of the values obtained using x 12 arima filtration from the trend obtained using the hodrick prescott filter 4 2 bayesian estimation determining the dsge model parameter values usually takes place in two stages in the first part the parameters are calibrated and in the second the values of other parameters are estimated using bayesian techniques the parameters corresponding to the amount of taxes in poland and the δrm factor were calibrated table 3 and the remaining parameters were estimated by bayesian estimation for the remaining parameters of the model an attempt was made to generate a posteriori distribution based on an arbitrarily determined a priori distribution fig 4 a priori distributions are assumed to have relatively large variances and are independent of each other while the marginal posterior parameter distributions obtained on the basis of numerical calculations should have low variance and thus a clear concentration of the distribution around the dominant values the sample from a posteriori distributions is obtained using the iterative metropolis hastings algorithm five markov chains were used to estimate marginal distributions using monte carlo methods each of which consisted of one million replications for which the burning rate was set at 25 therefore the first 250 000 implementations were rejected the average values for a priori distributions table 4 as well as the values of calibrated parameters were taken from other dsge models torres 2013 christiano et al 2005 analysis of the obtained results focused only on the parameters related to the flow of materials in the economy the first to notice is the parameter ϑ representing the constant elasticity of substitution between raw materials and materials recovered from consumption the value obtained is close to ¼ therefore the model indicates that in the long run one additional unit of materials resulting from recycling is a substitute for four units of raw material assuming constant demand for materials in the economy the second to notice is parameter δmc describing what part of consumption is recovered in the form of materials the model estimated the value of the parameter at 48 1 which means that 48 of consumption is recycled during interpretation one should remember that this is a value and not a quantity of recovered materials 4 3 impulse response functions the impulse response functions irf allow observation of the reaction of the economy in response to the model s structural shocks the assumption is that the economy is in a state of equilibrium when the shock occurs and no other external change takes place after the shock in response to the impulse the economy returns asymptotically to a state of equilibrium the shocks themselves are also not big they are usually set at one percent this section analyzes the economy s response to increasing the recycling rates fig 5 the length of the time window in which the impulse response function is observed has been set to forty periods remembering that the model works on quarterly data this corresponds to a period of ten years increasing the value of materials recovered from consumption has a positive effect on producers who as a result can produce more goods gdp growth is a natural consequence of this state of affairs since relative prices are not immediately corrected an increase in production results in an increase in enterprises profits and thus an increase in the level of remuneration households will use the surplus in the budget to increase consumption and net investments in capital a sudden increase in investments results in a decrease in their profitability 5 conclusions and discussion the circular economy concept depends on preserving the value of materials as environmental protection has become an important aspect of regional policy in malopolska the presented research attempts to answer the question of how converting waste into resources might impact the regional economy the difficulty in compiling the necessary empirical database has resulted in a situation where the environmental policy feedback mechanism still hasn t been fully integrated into ge models consequently a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model with an implemented resource recovery mechanism was constructed the parameters of the model were estimated on the basis of quarterly data from the period 2008 2017 as a result it was possible to prepare reliable estimates and confidence intervals for simulations this exercise revealed that in the long run one additional unit of material resulting from recycling is a substitute for four units of raw material assuming constant demand for materials in the economy this is an interesting result proving the profitability of closing the gap in the circulation of materials by increasing the amount of waste for reprocessing into products materials or substances whether for its original or other purposes the model also estimated the monetary value of recovered consumption understood here as recycling at 48 1 of the original materials value in 2017 eurostat estimated the average recycling rate of municipal waste in all 27 countries at 46 6 in most countries wastes were measured by tonnage but differences appear in the definitions of what was classified as municipal waste and in the calculation methods employed regional statistics are not available but poland s nationwide estimate was 35 2 in this context the recycling definition by value appears as a new and interesting option the source of economic fluctuations in dsge models are shocks therefore special attention was focused on shocks related to the increase in the amount of available materials resulting from the recovered resources the presented simulations show that an increase in the amount of materials resulting from an increase in the level of recovery leads to economic growth the wages and investments in the capital will increase but as a result return rates from the capital will drop the waste framework directive eu 2018 set a target of 50 of municipal waste to be reused and recycled in member states by 2020 the targets for the future were set to increase reuse and recycling of municipal waste to at least 55 of municipal waste by 2025 60 by 2030 and 65 by 2035 our research thus provides arguments to encourage this approach to environmental politics in the future this research has shown numerous resource efficiency benefits from ce implementation for the regional economy however the ce concept is much wider than only resource and waste management issues so implementing ce into regional development strategies also influences other regional development areas that improve the quality of life of the population hartley et al 2020 in discussing the positive influence of ce in the context of the sustainable development of regions additional attention should be paid to the environmental business and technology socio economic and spatial management benefits positive environmental impacts could be seen in the following areas utilization of raw materials commercial and industrial feedstock carbon sequestration environmental pollution reuse of goods and equipment refurbishment

24729,litopenaeus vannamei or pacific white shrimp is one of the main shrimp species cultivated around the world despite its easy handling there is no detailed description of its metabolic performance this work developed a novel mathematical model for l vannamei growth based on mass conservation and chemical equations for feed oxidation allowing to calculate shrimp specific growth rate specific rate of feed consumption specific rate of ammonia nitrogen excretion and oxygen specific consumption rate results when compared to literature data indicate a correlation higher than 99 demonstrating that the proposed approach can successfully predict the growth based on the assessed parameters through this strategy it is possible to optimize the management of shrimp cultivation especially in relation to dissolved oxygen availability of feed and ammonia excretion according to each stage of shrimp growth based on the environmental conditions maintained during the present study the result of the present mathematical model can be a potential tool for reducing costs and environmental impacts in aquaculture shrimp farm graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords stoichiometric equation specific growth rate oxygen consumption ammonia excretion statistical model 1 introduction marine shrimp are highly cultivated and commercialized representing the second largest group of aquaculture species and are an important economic source for many developing countries in asia and latin america this industry generates around 1 51 billion dollars us year fao 2015 2018 one of the main shrimp species cultivated is the l vannamei well known as pacific white shrimp its high reproductive potential rapid growth high market value and the existence of an established methods package for its cultivation are some of the characteristics that enabled the successful establishment of this industry fao 2014 despite ease of handling regulation of dissolved oxygen salinity temperature and feed quality are crucial during the l vannamei cultivation ponce palafox et al 1997a rosas et al 2001 hernández et al 2006 valenzuela quiñónez et al 2011 dissolved oxygen is the main limiting factor in aquaculture systems vinatea 1997 and during shrimp cultivation it is essential to maintain adequate levels of oxygen ranging from 4 0 to 5 5 mg of o2 l 1 timmons and ebeling 2007 changes in oxygen consumption reflect physiological responses of the shrimp to environmental conditions showing the relationship of dependence between the animals and the environment affecting the metabolic rate regnault 1987 schmidt nielsen 2002 inadequate conditions are potential stressors that negatively affect growth increase susceptibility to diseases causing mortality bett and vinatea 2009 abiotic factors such as water temperature and salinity can directly influence animal physiology temperature is related to the feed conversion rate and the pacific white shrimp reaches optimum growth in the range between 25 and 28 c ponce palafox et al 1997a hernández et al 2006 on the other hand salinity is related to osmoregulation process due to the ability of l vannamei to maintain osmotic regulation over a wide range this species can inhabit water with salt concentration values ranging from 0 5 to 40 however the optimal range for cultivation is from 15 to 25 saoud et al 2003 jayasankar et al 2009 paz et al 2011 maicá et al 2014 according to gao et al 2016 under intensive cultivation variations in salinity may break homeostasis and lead to significant stress slow growth low survival rate causing high economic losses the availability and quality of feed measured by protein value directly affects shrimp production mente 2003 commercial feeds contain from 30 to 50 of crude protein composed mostly of marine animal protein products such as fish shrimp and squid meal mente et al 2002 it is worth noting that feed composition directly influences the nitrogen levels in the culture system lee and lawrence 1985 seidman and lawrence 2009 the most common methodology used to maintain nitrogen balance during shrimp cultivation considers the difference between the nitrogen contained in the feed and that excreted into the water and within the feces the remaining nitrogen is that incorporated by shrimp however the wide variation in nitrogen incorporation 23 to 63 make this method practically ineffective boyd and teichert coddington 1995 hopkins et al 1995 velasco et al 1999 an alternate method for quantifying nitrogen incorporation is through the elementary mass balance and this makes possible correlation using stoichiometric balance between the oxidation of the nitrogen within the feed and the products of shrimp metabolism the modeling that can quantitatively represent an aquaculture system and the way in which the interactions between the variables that act in these systems occur allow us to better understand and support the production processes in their real context for example an equation can correspond perfectly to describe the change in any biological parameter associated with body weight due to allometric dependence zotin 2015 representations that aim to fully understand ecosystem phenomena offer an alternative to characterize biotic communities and initially tend to be highly abstract several holistic hypotheses can be tested in ecosystems macroscopic concepts can promote a better understanding of physical biological interactions and suggest the development of new instrumentation and technological methods ulanowicz and platt 1985 mathematical models can and should be used to interpret the hypotheses from a quantitative point of view giving us the information needed to predict consequences of rearing conditions and highlight conditions that should be corrected or maintained to obtain a productive shrimp growth cycle klemetson and rogers 1985 chen and malone 1992 panchang et al 1997 sodré 2007 byron et al 2011 timmons et al 2001 seginer 2016 however different mathematical models can demonstrate better performance than others providing useful information for prediction of animal growth teleken et al 2017 in this way there is a need to better establish description and prediction of metabolic performance with respect to feed consumption and product generation in shrimp aquaculture systems thus this work developed an elemental balance model based on stoichiometric chemical equation of the feed oxidation allowing the user to determine specific growth and oxygen specific consumption rates for marine shrimp l vannamei 2 material and methods the shrimp used in this study were taken from the stocks routinely cultivated by the shrimp marine laboratory lcm of the federal university of santa catarina ufsc for

sample of 60 gs of feed pellets were ground to obtain a homogeneous flour and dried at 55 c until constant weight samples containing thirty shrimp were obtained from five cultivation tanks with populations at different stages of cultivation the individual weight of the shrimp used was intentionally chosen between 2 and 10 g in order to represent the different growth phases making up five categories with weights of 1 to 2 2 to 4 4 to 6 6 to 8 and 8 to 10 g from each weight category two grams of muscle were removed from the shrimps and a pool containing muscle from all weight categories was created in this way a unique elemental sample was generated containing information with characteristics of all shrimp sizes samples were minced and dehydrated through evaporation within a drying oven at 55 c until sample weights stabilized samples were then ground to a homogeneous flour and dried again to constant weights at 55 c a feces sample of 10 g was collected from five different shrimp cultivation tanks 50 m3 from lcm ufsc and oven dried at 55 c to constant weight ground to a homogeneous flour and dried again to constant weight at 55 c after dried all samples were stored in a dehumidifier to avoid rehydration 2 2 elemental analyses elemental analyses of the samples were performed on a leco chnos truspec micro equipment following the astm d 5373 method astm 2012 the elemental analysis involves determining the mass percentage of carbon hydrogen nitrogen and oxygen in the dried samples of feed shrimp biomass and feces in this methodology the samples are burned in an oven at a temperature of 1423 k the combustion products are subsequently transferred to a secondary oven with a temperature of 1123 k for total oxidation of the compounds in this technique the amounts of carbon and hydrogen in the form of co2 and h2o were determined using an infrared detector the nitrogen content was measured using a thermal conductivity detector the oxygen was measured in the same equipment by a separate module that performs the combustion of the compound in a pyrolysis oven at a temperature of 1573 k which guarantees the complete release of oxygen in the form of co2

nitrogen balance between undigested feed feces shrimp biomass ammonia and urea described in fig 1 we determined the coefficients b c d and e of eq 2 additionally we calculated the molar balance for

specific feed consumption rate as a function of the shrimp size and the specific shrimp oxygen consumption rate as a function of the shrimp size were analysed for this the statistical analysis used the pearson correlation coefficient r as proposed by santana neto 2017 3 results and discussion 3 1 elemental composition the results obtained from the elemental analysis and the minimum formula mf elemental composition of feed shrimp biomass and feces are presented in table 1 according to our chemical analysis the nitrogen content of the feed table 1 was determined as 6 0 which is 0 4 higher than indicated by the manufacturer 5 6 shrimp biomass shows a much higher content of nitrogen 11 0 compared to the feed it is because the animal incorporates nitrogen into biomass over time forming its muscle fibers for example this process is inherent in the animal growth the elemental composition of feces shown in table 1 represents a mixture of digested and undigested compounds and a small amount of ammonia since shrimp excretion occurs mainly by the gills regnault 1987 schmidt nielsen 2002 3 2 stoichiometric balance the coefficients resulting from the elemental balance as shown in fig

stoichiometric model eq 8 proposes the nitrogen budget of l vannamei metabolism considering the mass conservation principles fig 1 alternate formulation and digestibility of feed used in aquaculture may change the stoichiometric equation coefficients that can be estimated for this new setup in growth condition using the proposed methodology this method can be extended to other species where the digestibility of the feed and the chemical content of the feed biomass and feces are known from this stoichiometric equation it is possible to predict the mass quantity of products generated and obtain a global mass balance for the system also it supports establishing a control system for shrimp farming mathematical modeling has been used successfully in animal rearing operations providing a quantitative understanding of cultivation scale metabolic processes and aiding problem solving in real world applications chen and malone 1992 sodré 2007 seginer 2016 fontes et al 2019 cheng et al 2020 de melo filho et al 2020 3 3 specific rates the fig 2 shows the specific growth rate μshr 1 d of the shrimp obtained in this work as a function of the total mass of the shrimp shrimp size in terms of wet weight the data were estimated from adjusted function to experimental data of shrimp growth and its derivative eqs 3 and 4 a power law equation of μshr values fitted to the actual total shrimp wet mass w resulted in eq 9 with r2 0 9999 9 μ s h r 4 39 10 2 w 5 38 t from the stoichiometric model presented in eq 8 we estimated the mass yield factors y s h r r 0 0726 gshr gfeed and y n n h 3 r 0 02851 g n n h 3 g f e e d and y o 2 s h r r 0 7926 g o 2 g f e e d the specific rate of feed consumption μr and ammonia nitrogen production μ n n h 3 were estimated as a function of w using these yield factors eq 9 5 and 6 the fig 3 shows both specific rates plotted against shrimp wet mass as well as data from the literature which were used to estimate the pearson s correlation experimental values of μr were obtained according to nunes and parsons 2000 and μ n n h 3 values were based on the average value of excretion of ammonia nitrogen 65 described by regnault 1987 the results of pearson s analysis showed r values between the model proposed in the present work and values from the literature of 0 9995 and 0 9995 to μr and μ n n h 3 respectively shrimp specific respiration rate estimated by eq 7 and converted to endogenous condition as a function of the shrimp wet mass determined in this work is presented in fig 4 as well as the experimental data found in the literature for it ponce palafox et al 1997b valenzuela quiñónez et al 2011 endogenous specific respiration rate μ o 2 s h r was determined through data obtained by rosas et al 2001 in which it was observed that shrimp under endogenous respiration presents around 49 lower values of rate when compared to shrimp with the full digestive tract pearson s analysis showed r values of 0 9998 and 0 9999 when compared to ponce palafox et al 1997b and valenzuela quiñónez et al 2011 data respectively showing good agreement between the model proposed and experimental data reported in the literature in aquaculture the average specific growth rate 0 0199 1 d fig 2 is used to compare cultures or experiments under different conditions however the specific growth rate at a cultivation condition decreases with increasing mass as can be seen by the experimental data and identified by the model proposed in this work assigning the mean value of the specific growth rate to the whole cultivation will generate underestimated and overestimated values according to the animal mass also all process control will be impaired since all other specific rates are proportional to the specific growth rate 4 conclusion the proposed model using a stoichiometric equation based on the conservation of elementary nitrogen allows calculating both specific consumption rate of feed and oxygen at different shrimp growth stages also it is possible to obtain from the equations ammonia urea feces undigested feed and carbon dioxide kinetics representing this relatively complex system therefore this work presents a tool for better management in shrimp farming based on the environmental conditions proposed in the present study controlled and clear water systems including the prediction of required dissolved oxygen concentration and feed amount at each growth phase inlaying in reducing costs and environmental impact associated credit authorship contribution statement marcos estevão santiago de

elemental composition of feed shrimp biomass and feces are presented in table 1 according to our chemical analysis the nitrogen content of the feed table 1 was determined as 6 0 which is 0 4 higher than indicated by the manufacturer 5 6 shrimp biomass shows a much higher content of nitrogen 11 0 compared to the feed it is because the animal incorporates nitrogen into biomass over time forming its muscle fibers for example this process is inherent in the animal growth the elemental composition of feces shown in table 1 represents a mixture of digested and undigested compounds and a small amount of ammonia since shrimp excretion occurs mainly by the gills regnault 1987 schmidt nielsen 2002 3 2 stoichiometric balance the coefficients resulting from the elemental balance as shown in fig 1 applied to the stoichiometric equation eq 2 is presented in eq 8 8 c 7 h 12 o 4 n 4 31 o 2 0 1231 c 6 h 8 o 2 n 0 4831 c 6 h 11 o 6 n 0 0197 c h 4 o n 0 3544 n h 3 2 28 h 2 o 3 59 c o 2 the stoichiometric model eq 8 proposes the nitrogen budget of l vannamei metabolism considering the mass conservation principles fig 1 alternate formulation and digestibility of feed used in aquaculture may change the stoichiometric equation coefficients that can be estimated for this new setup in growth condition using the proposed methodology this method can be extended to other species where the digestibility of the feed and the chemical content of the feed biomass and feces are known from this stoichiometric equation it is possible to predict the mass quantity of products generated and obtain a global mass balance for the system also it supports establishing a control system for shrimp farming mathematical modeling has been used successfully in animal rearing operations providing a quantitative understanding of cultivation scale metabolic processes and aiding problem solving in real world applications chen and malone 1992 sodré 2007 seginer 2016 fontes et al 2019 cheng et al 2020 de melo filho et al 2020 3 3 specific rates the fig 2 shows the specific growth rate μshr 1 d of the shrimp obtained in this work as a function of the total mass of the shrimp shrimp size in terms of wet weight the data were estimated from adjusted function to experimental data of shrimp growth and its derivative eqs 3 and 4 a power law equation of μshr values fitted to the actual total shrimp wet mass w resulted in eq 9 with r2 0 9999 9 μ s h r 4 39 10 2 w 5 38 t from the stoichiometric model presented in eq 8 we estimated the mass yield factors y s h r r 0 0726 gshr gfeed and y n n h 3 r 0 02851 g n n h 3 g f e e d and y o 2 s h r r 0 7926 g o 2 g f e e d the specific rate of feed consumption μr and ammonia nitrogen production μ n n h 3 were estimated as a function of w using these yield factors eq 9 5 and 6 the fig 3 shows both specific rates plotted against shrimp wet mass as well as data from the literature which were used to estimate the pearson s correlation experimental values of μr were obtained according to nunes and parsons 2000 and μ n n h 3 values were based on the average value of excretion of ammonia nitrogen 65 described by regnault 1987 the results of pearson s analysis showed r values between the model proposed in the present work and values from the literature of 0 9995 and 0 9995 to μr and μ n n h 3 respectively shrimp specific respiration rate estimated by eq 7 and converted to endogenous condition as a function of the shrimp wet mass determined in this work is presented in fig 4 as well as the experimental data found in the literature for it ponce palafox et al 1997b valenzuela quiñónez et al 2011 endogenous specific respiration rate μ o 2 s h r was determined through data obtained by rosas et al 2001 in which it was observed that shrimp under endogenous respiration presents around 49 lower values of rate when compared to shrimp with the full digestive tract pearson s analysis showed r values of 0 9998 and 0 9999 when compared to ponce palafox et al 1997b and valenzuela quiñónez et al 2011 data respectively showing good agreement between the model proposed and experimental data reported in the literature in aquaculture the average specific growth rate 0 0199 1 d fig 2 is used to compare cultures or experiments under different conditions however the specific growth rate at a cultivation condition decreases with increasing mass as can be seen by the experimental data and identified by the model proposed in this work assigning the mean value of the specific growth rate to the whole cultivation will generate underestimated and overestimated values according to the animal mass also all process control will be impaired since all other specific rates are proportional to the specific growth rate 4 conclusion the proposed model using a stoichiometric equation based on the conservation of elementary nitrogen allows calculating both specific consumption rate of feed and oxygen at different shrimp growth stages also it is possible to obtain from the equations ammonia urea feces undigested feed and carbon dioxide kinetics representing this relatively complex system therefore this work presents a tool for better management in shrimp farming based on the environmental conditions proposed in the present study controlled and clear water systems including the prediction of required dissolved oxygen concentration and feed amount at each growth phase inlaying in reducing costs and environmental impact associated credit authorship contribution statement marcos estevão santiago de
