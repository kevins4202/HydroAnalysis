15570,bilgewater is a shipboard multi component oily wastewater combining numerous wastewater sources a better understanding of bilgewater emulsions is required for proper wastewater management to meet discharge regulations in this study we developed 360 emulsion samples based on commonly used navy cleaner data and previous bilgewater composition studies oil value ov was obtained from image analysis of oil creaming layer and validated by oil separation os which was experimentally determined using a gravimetric method ov showed good agreement with os indicating that a simple image based parameter can be used for emulsion stability prediction model development an anova analysis was conducted of the five variables cleaner salinity suspended solids ss ph and temperature that significantly impacted estimates of ov finding that the cleaner salinity and ss variables were statistically significant p 0 05 while ph and temperature were not in general most cleaners showed improved oil separation with salt additions novel machine learning ml based predictive models of both classification and regression for bilgewater emulsion stability were then developed using ov for classification the random forest rf classifiers achieved the most accurate prediction with f1 score of 0 8224 while in regression based models the decision tree dt regressor showed the highest prediction of emulsion stability with the average mean absolute error mae of 0 1611 turbidity also showed a good emulsion prediction with rf regressor mae of 0 0559 and rf classifier f1 score of 0 9338 one predictor variable removal test showed that salinity ss and temperature are the most impactful variables in the developed models this is the first study to use image processing and machine learning for the prediction of oil separation for the application of bilgewater assessment within the marine sector graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords bilgewater coalescence emulsion stability image processing machine learning oil in water emulsions 1 introduction bilgewater is a shipboard multi component oily wastewater composed of lubricant and hydraulic oils cleaning agents solvents and seawater and must be managed properly to meet the bilgewater discharge regulations with a maximum oil concentration limit of 15 ppm church et al 2019 hwang et al 2021 sharp 1993 however chemically stabilized oil in water o w emulsions formed in bilgewater have been a challenge for oil separation resulting in lower processing rates and decreased operational efficiency of traditional oil water separators ows church et al 2021a in practice the creaming layer of the chemically stabilized emulsion can foul oil sensors while kinetically stable emulsions can pass through the gravity separator e g ows physicochemical properties such as temperature ph suspended solids ss surfactant type and concentration ionic strength e g salinity and mixing intensity were identified as important variables which can impact chemically stabilized o w emulsion stability due to their interaction with the interfacial film between oil and water church et al 2019 diaz et al 2020 for example emulsion stability decreases with salinity ionic strength addition and temperature increase resulting in higher oil separation diaz et al 2020 emulsion stability can also be affected by temperature because of its effect on physical properties and surfactant solubility church et al 2017 detailed hypotheses and assumptions of the effect of physicochemical properties on bilgewater emulsion stability can be found elsewhere church et al 2017 thus a better understanding of these physical and thermodynamic properties of emulsions and surfactant transport behavior is critical to help improve bilgewater treatment and management recently the stability of shipboard oily bilgewater emulsions has been studied extensively to identify governing factors by investigating interfacial tension and droplet coalescence chen and dutcher 2020 chen et al 2020 church et al 2021b davis et al 2021 however due to the time consuming and laborious experimental determination of emulsion stability as well as the complexity of emulsion stability bilgewater treatment methods have often followed an edisonian approach in which an ows is tested against a set of treatment performance criteria rather than investigating the genesis of emulsion formation in relation to the solution s composition despite the increasing concerns of these chemically stabilized emulsions in bilgewater management reliably predicting stability based on basic physicochemical data is not well documented artificial intelligence ai techniques have recently demonstrated potential in overcoming the subjectivity and time consumption associated with conventional techniques in industry unnikrishnan et al 2021 in particular a computer vision analysis integrated with machine learning ml such as mobile microscopy and automated image analysis has gained great attention to create fast cheap location and knowledge independent systems for many use cases pfeil et al 2018 for example the automated image feature extraction was used to characterize droplet formation of pharmaceutical emulsions and numerous ml and deep learning dl models were explored unnikrishnan et al 2021 another example is the classification of morphological and color features for plant seeds in the biodiesel production industry sector isaza et al 2018 isaza et al 2018 used an image analysis technique for the extraction of color and morphological features of plant seeds and well known data mining algorithms were applied to cluster all samples recent advances in computer vision image analysis and data mining techniques have enabled many industrial processes to achieve fast accurate and objective evaluation of product quality e g classification in food industry metilli et al 2020 unnikrishnan et al 2021 although a few studies reported ml based emulsion stability models e g artificial neural network using physicochemical properties e g particle size zeta potential conductance and viscosity de souza 2007 kumar et al 2011 the use of ai along with image processing for bilgewater emulsion assessment and stability prediction was not reported yet the objective of this study was to use computer vision image analysis and ml algorithms in order to develop predictive modeling for bilgewater emulsion stability under different environmental conditions e g ph salinity ss cleaner type and temperature both classification and regression modes were developed to investigate the feasibility of ml applications to bilgewater emulsions while classification is to predict a discrete class label output of bilgewater emulsion stability regression is to predict a continuous quantity output as this study recognizes the challenges of the highly variable nature of bilgewater emulsion stability under various conditions e g surfactant and environmental factors this study first collected a useable dataset by conducting well balanced experiments with selected variables e g type of cleaner ph temperature ss and salinity the variables were then included to construct a model that predicts bilgewater emulsion stability which can enable more intentional bilgewater treatment system selection and improved bilgewater management this subject has not been studied in relation to emulsion characterization for bilgewater treatment and management in this study a bilgewater emulsion stability model was newly developed by the following four steps 1 choosing candidate inputs and conditions influencing emulsion stability 2 performing laboratory experiments by applying such inputs and conditions to bilgewater emulsion samples

various classification and regression models were tested to evaluate predictive models representing emulsion stability along with sensitivity analysis of each descriptor and one predictor variable

surfactants used for this study based on the safety data sheets the primary surfactants are diverse including fluorosurfactant 6 afff cocamide diethanolamine b b blast off and calla alcohol ethoxylate calla prc and solid surge and alkyl aryl polyether alcohol type 1 the surfactants used in these clears are primarily nonionic but could potentially include other types of surfactants therefore two neat surfactants triton x 100 sigma aldrich cas 9002 93 1 nonionic surfactant and sodium dodecyl sulfate sds sigma aldrich cas 151 21 3 anionic surfactant were compared for reference purposes church et al 2017 emulsion samples were prepared in the total organic carbon toc vial with a total sample volume of 30 ml glc 01020 40 ml qorpak pa usa and carefully cleaned to remove possible contamination that could affect result consistency prior to sample preparation vials were rinsed multiple times with hot water and soap dri clean decon labs prussia pa and then with a solution of 1 m hcl navy

nacl 35 000 ppm nacl was selected for salinity level which represents seawater munshi et al 2018 and 1000 ppm of ss was chosen based on the reported general characteristics of bilgewater church et al 2019 diaz et al 2020 the emulsion samples were mixed using a hand held homogenizer probe omni tissue master model 125 10 mm generator probe at 33 000 rpm for 2 min diaz et al 2020 the probe level was inserted halfway into the sample to ensure identical homogenization conditions and sample replicability for ss arizona coarse test dust power technology inc arden hills mn was used as a model solid particle iso 12103 1 a4 coarse test dust diaz et al 2020 concentrations of cleaner surfactant above cmc i e 7 cmc were used to ensure micelle formation and complete coverage of the oil droplet surface hsu and nacu 2003 after homogenization the vials containing the samples were capped and the oil separation was investigated under an undisturbed condition for 5 days turbidity ntu of the aqueous portion of the emulsion samples was measured after 5 days of undisturbed condition using a turbidimeter hach 2100n co usa baird et al 2012 for the measurement of turbidity the oil and creaming layers were carefully removed from the emulsion samples using a pipette and then the aqueous portion only was transferred into a turbidity cell hach product no 2084900 co usa 2 2 determination of oil value ov using image processing in this study two different ml based emulsion stability models were constructed for predicting 1 coalescence emulsion stability using ov and 2 kinetic emulsion stability using turbidity ov was selected to represent the ability of oil separation in bilgewater e g higher ov such as 1 indicates 100 oil separation while turbidity was selected as an indirect indicator of oil separation thus coalescence stability is the ability for emulsion droplets to coalesce and form a separated oil layer while kinetic stability was defined as the ability for emulsion droplets to stay in suspension in the emulsion layer the prepared emulsion samples consist of three layers oil layer creaming layer and emulsion layer fig 1 a as shown in fig 1 b the layers for coalescence stability are located at the top area of bilgewater samples while the layers for kinetic stability are found below the coalescence stability layers emulsion stability was analyzed based on the formation of an oil layer which is important for bilgewater treatment the images of oil creaming layers of the prepared emulsion samples were obtained at 5 days using a digital camera powershot a480 cannon and a total of 360 images were processed to determine oil value ov for developing emulsion stability models using ml the 5 day image was selected based on the previous study where oil is not observed to further coalesce diaz et al 2020 the major changes occurred within the first day after homogenization an image processing code using opencv bradski 2000 was created to identify the status of oil coalescence in an oil and creaming layer by recording its corresponding color accordingly the perfect creaming state was determined as 0 while the perfect oil separation was determined as 100 ov fig 2 a the height of oil and creaming layers is different with cleaners surfactants as well as environmental conditions si figs s1 s3 non target layers were not considered for image processing and black color was used as a background color in image calibration fig 2 b no image filter was used the rgb color was then normalized to be 255 255 255 for creaming while it was adjusted to be 0 0 0 for oil color the ov was then calculated followed by eq 1 1 oil value ov 255 r g b 3 255 where r g and b are the averages of the total values of red green and blue respectively for example the 1st photo in fig 2 b has a total of 5763 pixels 113 pixels of height and 51 pixels of width in these pixels the rgb values are extracted as a list structure containing values r g and b such as r1 198 g1 185 b1 163 r2 234 g2 218 b2 192 rn 234 gn 218 bn 192 where n 5763 for each color value the sum of the values from the 5763 pixels is averaged e g 198 234 234 5763 then the average colors for r g and b were used in eq 1 the calculated ov was validated with the experimentally determined oil separation os for emulsion samples with a clearly identified oil phase os was calculated using eq 2 by determining the height of the oil layer at 5 days of each emulsion sample using a java based image processing program imagej nih 2 oil separation os height of the separated oil layer total height of the oil used where the total height of the oil in the toc vial was 0 68 cm 3 ml of nsbm 4 oil however some emulsion samples have a simultaneous formation of a creaming and oil layer which made it difficult to determine os by visual inspection in this case os was quantified by a gravimetric method using macro phase separation a preliminary test with the same emulsion samples showed that os values were consistent between gravimetric and height based measurements for the procedure of the gravimetric method the samples at 4 days were gently poured into a separatory funnel pyrex 6402 125 125 ml cole parmer vernon hills il usa and left to settle for 24 h to allow the samples to separate into its oil creaming and oil layer after 24 h which is at 5 days of the total experiment duration the separatory funnel was placed in a holder and the oil layer was collected in a pre weighted beaker and then weighted to determine oil separation using a balance os was then calculated by diving the weight of the collected oil per sample by the weight of the total oil used in the emulsion preparation 2 54 g of 3 ml of nsbm 4 oil all measurements were duplicated standard deviation of 0 3 8 4 2 3 statistical analysis to examine statistical relationships for ov under the experimental conditions one way two way and three way anova were used for hypothesis testing for anova the null hypothesis h 0 was that the mean was the same for all considered groups while the alternative hypothesis h 1 was that at least one of the means was not the same for all considered groups before applying anova to our data we first checked fundamental assumptions that justify its validity i the probability distributions of the residuals were normal normality and ii the variance across groups was homogeneous homoscedasticity to select the best model to fit the data we used akaike s information criterion aic akaike 1974 the aic criteria are used to choose the model which yields the smallest value of aic based on the number of estimated parameters and the maximum likelihood estimate for the model 2 4 development of ml based emulsion stability models 2 4 1 data preprocessing and feature selection for cleaners surfactant information instead of using cleaner surfactant name or type as one of the variables their physicochemical properties total 8 which represent each cleaner surfactant were included in ml modeling table 2 in particular 7 times critical micelle concentration 7 cmc was used to prepare the emulsions to ensure complete coverage of the oil droplet surface hsu and nacu 2003 for the selected factors data normalization was applied by scaling between zero and one 0 1 2 4 2 ml for emulsion stability models the model selection was a downselection process from well known ml algorithms to select the best predictive model two types of ml algorithms regression and classification were used to identify the best emulsion stability prediction model nine regression algorithms were tested in this study deep learning regressor bayesian ridge regressor mackay 1992 random forest regressor decision tree regressor quinlan 1986 gradient boosting regressor multilayer perceptron regressor hinton 1989 linear regressor galton 1886 gaussian process regressor williams and rasmussen 1995 and support vector regressor chang and lin 2011 on the other hand 9 classification algorithms were tested in this study k nearest neighbor classifier gaussian process classifier decision tree classifier random forest classifier ho 2002 multilayer perceptron classifier adaptive boost classifier breiman 1998 and gaussian naive bayes classifier maron 1961 except for the deep learning regressor scikit learn a python based ml library was utilized to develop the regression and classification models with default hyperparameters for the development of the deep learning regressor keras chollet 2017 a python based deep learning library was used a deep learning architecture was selected as this can provide a better prediction result among other architectures see the si for deep learning architecture selection for the ml step the following experimental settings were conducted the total data size was 360 after data preprocessing and it was split into 80 in the training set 288 and 20 in the test set 72 by being randomly taken from the original data for the 80 training set cross validation with 10 folds was applied for model validation in which nine tenth of the training set was randomly selected for developing prediction models and the remaining data from the training set i e one tenth were used for model validation the final cross validation scores were averaged cross validation was used to downselect which models can have a better prediction of emulsion stability the best model selection was then finalized with the test set from downselected models from cross validation for regression mae was used as an evaluation metric i e prediction score normalized from 0 to 1 and a lower number of mae indicates a better prediction of a regression model for classification f1 score was used as an evaluation metric normalized from 0 to 1 and a higher number of f1 score indicates a better prediction of a classification model the target variables were converted to categorical variables with three states low mid and high with 33 3 per each category for ov and turbidity due to imbalanced data e g the number of the low labeled data is higher than the number of the high labeled data the synthetic minority over sampling technique called smote chawla et al 2002 was applied to the data for the classification experiment smote generated more samples using the original data to ensure the balance of the data the experiments were run on a 3 40 ghz intel core i7 3770 processor 2 4 3 sensitivity analysis for predictor variables for ov and turbidity to understand the effects of predictor variables on ov and turbidity an f value test for the sensitivity analysis was performed on the 12 predictor variables to evaluate statistically significant factors the f value test aims to identify parameters that can be used to control and manage the coalescence stability in bilgewater in practice the high score of the f value indicates the high correlation between predictor and target variables f value is a positive numeric value indicating a correlation p i between a predictor variable and target variable eq 2 pedregosa et al 2011 2 p i x i m e a n x i y m e a n y s t d x i s t d y where x is an input matrix for values of the predictor variables and y is a vector for values of the target variables for each predictor variable i we can compute the correlation p i mean and std are the functions for mean and standard deviation respectively f value fi can be computed as shown in the following equation eq 3 pedregosa et al 2011 3 f i p i 2 1 p i 2 n 2 where n denotes the number of samples of y from a f distribution table e g ɑ 0 05 a cutoff of 1 is used to define high correlation in f test f values less than 1 are considered to have less correlation between predictor and target variables 3 results and discussion 3 1 ov acquisition using image processing ov was determined using the oil creaming layer images of the prepared emulsion samples taken at 5 days when there was no noticeable change in appearance visual inspection showed diverse emulsion stabilities with different cleaners surfactants temperatures ss concentrations and salinities si figs s1 s3 fig 3 illustrates that successful acquisition of ov based on image processing of oil and creaming layers was possible and the results resembled os results si figs s4 and s5 in fig 3 green denoted as mainly oil was used for emulsions with more than 66 6 oil separation or samples with coalescence as the main destabilization mechanism yellow creaming oil was used for emulsions presenting an oil layer formation as well as a predominant creaming layer white only creaming was used for samples with less than 33 3 oil separation emulsion separation due to creaming is not definitive and can be easily re dispersed while the formation of an oil layer is typically considered permanent the resulting emulsion stability using the mean of ov from most stable to least stable was type 1 22 b b 47 sds 53 power green 55 triton x 100 63 calla 66 solid surge 67 prc 67 6 afff 69 blast off 87 fig 4 a among 10 cleaners surfactants type 1 showed to produce the most stable emulsion while blast off resulted in the most unstable emulsion highest tendency to coalescence for neat surfactants sds e g anionic surfactant resulted in less oil separation with lower ov indicating greater emulsion stability compared to triton x 100 e g nonionic surfactant 3 2 statistical analysis of ov with different cleaners and environmental conditions an anova analysis was conducted to evaluate the importance of the type of cleaner and various environmental variables e g salinity ss ph and temperature on the determined ov the 360 samples si table s2 were composed of 3 categorical variables cleaner salinity and ss and 3 quantitative variables ph temperature and ov we considered different combinations of the five explanatory variables with a balanced design to investigate their effects on ov for one way anova the p values of cleaner ss and salinity were less than 0 05 implying that there is strong evidence that the means of ov for cleaners ss and salinity were not the same this indicates that the type of cleaner ss and salinity have significant impacts on ov although temperature was marginally significant with p values of 0 057 it was excluded from the final model selection procedure for clear interpretation ph showed high p values 0 429 implying that the experimental data did not support the variable of ph affecting ov in the experiments this finding does not mean that ph and temperature are not important to oil coalescence and emulsion stability even though ph and temperature are important chemical parameters for determining emulsion stability chen and tao 2005 kokal 2002 the current data could not discern a significant impact with respect to ov for the studied systems this is likely because of builders and other additives commonly found in cleaners that enable efficacy in a wide range of conditions church et al 2021b further anova analysis was conducted with the selected three significant variables cleaner ss and salinity for the two way anova additive model the effects of the type of cleaner ss and salinity on ov were statistically significant p 0 05 for every combination of the two variables similarly for three way anova additive and interaction models the effects of the three variables were significant p 0 05 only except for the three way interaction term from the aic results the three way anova with an interaction model with cleaner ss and salinity variables was selected as the best fit model with the lowest aic value 124 72 and 100 of the aic weight si table s3 this means that the selected model explains 100 of the total variation in the dependent variable ov that can be explained by the full set of considered models in diagnostic plots si fig s6 it was found that the selected model satisfied the anova assumptions because the residuals had approximately similar spreads at the fitted values for all groups one could assume the homogeneity of variances the q q plot shows the linearity of the points which suggests that the data are normally distributed although there were potential outliers that could affect the assumptions the deviations were minimal descriptive statistics showed the variations based on two different concentrations of ss and salinity for example the means of ov were clearly different between 0 ppm ss 0 54 and 1000 ppm ss 0 66 fig 4 b the means of ov between 0 ppm salinity 0 41 and 35 000 ppm salinity 0 78 were also different from each other fig 4 c these indicate the positive effect of ss and salinity on oil separation of the bilgewater emulsion samples although temperature was found statistically insignificant in 95 confidence p values of 0 057 the trend of increased ov was found with increased temperature fig 4 d higher ss concentration salinity and temperature reduced emulsion stability and promoted oil separation according to the results of the tukey kramer test we distinguished different combinations of three variables into six cleaner ss eight cleaner salinity and three ss salinity groups si table s4 the groups with the same letter were not significantly different from each other in the lettered grouping in terms of the mean of ov fig 5 depicts box plots of the data grouped by the combination of the types of the cleaner and ss variables fig 5 a and cleaner and salinity variables fig 5 b the lettered group from the tukey kramer test si table s4 is also illustrated above each of the box plots the same lettered group of box plots indicates that they are not statistically different while a different lettered group indicates that the difference between groups is statistically significant for example in fig 5 b 6 afff b b calla sds solid surge and triton x have different groups between 0 and 35 000 of salinity showing that these cleaners surfactants present a salinity effect on their emulsion stability higher salinity for these cleaners surfactants resulted in higher ov indicating better oil separation however blast off power green prc and type 1 contained at least one same group between 0 and 35 000 of salinity indicating that the salinity effect is statistically insignificant for these cleaners surfactants in general higher salinity resulted in higher ov indicating a more coalesced oil layer however throughout the analysis it was also found that there were significantly different means of ov based on the type of cleaner for example regardless of the presence of ss and salinity blast off showed the highest ov while type 1 and b b showed low ov even with high salinity one interesting observation was that calla power green prc solid surge and triton x 100 which are in the middle range of ov 0 44 0 63 showed a wide spread of ov between 0 and 1 regardless of the presence of ss and salinity fig 5 fig 6 displays box plots of the data grouped by the combination of ss and salinity while higher ss destabilized the o w emulsion improving the oil separation in the absence of salinity once salinity becomes high 35 000 ppm in the emulsion the effect of ss on oil separation was negligible a greater ov for emulsion samples with high salinity would be expected as high ionic strength conditions provide a significant impact on emulsion stability lowering zeta potential and thus increasing droplet interaction kulmyrzaev et al 2000 this interaction can increase oil coalescence with salinity addition lowering emulsion stability church et al 2017 particularly the bilgewater samples prepared with 6 afff b b calla sds solid surge and triton x were characterized for their high ov in the presence of salinity fig 5 b this could be explained by the low resistance of electrostatically stabilized emulsions to saline conditions it was also known that the aqueous phase salinity can affect the solubility of the emulsifier which can impact the stability at the interface or cause the drag out of the surfactant e g ionic surfactants iyota and krastev 2009 this indicates that at sufficient ionic strengths fast coalescence resulting in major phase separation will likely occur on the other hand some cots cleaners showed different results regardless of their primary surfactants for example b b prc and calla have the same primary surfactant i e alcohol ethoxylate but b b and calla showed oil separation with the salinity while prc showed no significant effect of salinity on the prc emulsion samples it seems that unknown compounds that are included in the cots cleaners seem to have more governing effects on emulsion stability compared to salinity 3 3 emulsion stability prediction model 3 3 1 ov prediction model regression and classification using the acquired ov regression and classification models were constructed to predict the emulsion stability and compared each other for regression models nine regression algorithms were compared with the mae scores as shown in table 3 which lists two results i e validation and test results for each algorithm the validation results were the averaged maes for the cross validations with 10 folds for ov the decision tree dt regressor shows the most accurate results 0 1611 of mae among other algorithms random forest rf regressor was the next selection for the prediction with 0 1834 of mae both random forest rf and decision tree dt regressor algorithms are based on ensemble learning in which simple predictive models e g decision trees collaborate to predict a target value rf is known as one of the most widely used supervised algorithms without too much hyper parameter tuning and it merges various decision trees to avoid overfitting and get a robust prediction han et al 2019 for two models dt and rf for ov the comparison between the actual and predicted ov values were similar indicating well performed predictive models for emulsion stability although there are two extreme cases for the actual values of zero 100 creaming layer and one 100 oil layer si fig s7 to ensure whether the current datasets 360 are sufficient to obtain a good prediction model a set of analyses in which various data sizes from 90 to 360 were applied with the rf model was performed to investigate the proper size of data although there is still room for improvement the current data size of 360 was found to be sufficient from averaged mae values for regression and f 1 scores for classification si fig s8 for classification models three categories that are equally divided less than 33 3 between 33 3 and 66 6 greater than 66 6 have been used for ov and seven classification algorithms were compared with the f1 scores as shown in table 3 the validation results were the averages of f1 scores for the cross validations with 10 folds the test result of ov was 0 8224 with rf classifier indicating a good prediction of the classification of emulsion stability overall the ml models using image processed values ov showed acceptable prediction in coalescence stability with the dt regressor for the regression model and the rf classifier for classification 3 3 2 turbidity prediction model regression and classification prediction models for kinetic stability using turbidity values were developed using regression and classification algorithms for this the same set of regression and classification algorithms with coalescence stability analysis was used for the regression test the rf regressor achieved the highest mae score of 0 0559 while for the classification test the rf classifier obtained the highest f1 score of 0 9338 among tested algorithms table 3 both regression and classification tests showed that the ml approach is applicable to predict the turbidity value with high accuracy 3 3 3 the effect of predictor variables on the prediction of ov and turbidity table 4 lists the results of the f value test for 12 predictor variables for ov and turbidity for ov salinity showed the strongest correlation with the target variables with the f value of 112 the results agreed with the statistical analysis and previous studies church et al 2017 where salt concentration was found to be a master variable for controlling the coalescence stability of emulsions the effect of other variables on the ov prediction was minimal for turbidity micelle size showed the highest correlation with the f value of 46 and the salinity showed the next correlation with the kinetic stability variables other than salinity and micelle size showed a relatively low impact on the emulsion stability prediction the effects of ss ph and temperature were not found to be significant in ov prediction in this sensitivity analysis however sensitivity analysis provides a rough correlation considering their linearity and thus it may be difficult to determine whether the parameter is sensitive when the f value is in the middle or low range therefore an additional sensitivity analysis a one predictor variable removal test was performed for further analysis of the effect of an individual variable on ov and turbidity prediction 3 3 4 one predictor variable removal test for ov and turbidity as the f value test provides only rough information in correlation for each predictor variable we performed another sensitivity analysis a one predictor variable removal test in which one of the predictor variables is removed one by one from the set of the 12 predictor variables and the remaining predictor variables are used for ml and each prediction test then the results of the original prediction test are compared with the results from the one predictor variable removal test table 5 shows the results of the one predictor variable removal test for ov and turbidity in regression models the first row of each ov and turbidity denotes the mae results from each original prediction test the following rows present each variable that is removed for the test for example in the second row of ov the variable surfactant concentration was removed from 12 predictor variables and the remaining 11 predictor variables were used for ml for ov prediction followed by each regression test the values in the cells below the first row denote the differences between the original prediction test and each test therefore the positive value in each cell means that the value may positively influence the prediction result while the negative value in each cell means that the value may negatively influence the prediction result and should be removed from the consideration to improve the prediction for example in the column of the dt regressor which was the most accurate model for ov prediction when the predictor variable salinity was removed from the model the model accuracy went down from the original 0 1611 to 0 4142 with a difference of 0 2531 indicating that salinity is the most influential parameter among 12 predictor variables to improve the accuracy there were no negative values in the one predictor variable removal tests with the selected ml models for ov and turbidity indicating that all 12 variables are meaningful variables for both coalescence and kinetic emulsion stability prediction in the dt regressor with ov environmental parameters such as salinity temperature and ss seem to be the most influential factors for emulsion stability prediction compared to other variables in the rf regressor model for turbidity salinity was the most influential factor for the kinetic stability followed by ph and temperature the results of the one predictor variable removal test are in good agreement with findings observed in literature as well as the anova model section 3 2 in general salinity and temperature are known to play significant roles in emulsion stability zolfaghari et al 2016 many studies have reported the effect of salinity or ionic strength on the oil in water emulsion stability due to surfactant adsorption behavior and a reduction in the ift hezave et al 2013 water salinity is known to be an important parameter for spontaneous emulsification for oil in water systems davis et al 2020 in our previous study it was observed that emulsion samples with high concentrations of nacl were found to be less stable church et al 2017 this is because of an effect called salting out which reduces the hydrophilicity of surfactants and diminishes the solubility of surfactants in the aqueous phase thus decreasing an o w emulsion stability martínez palou et al 2013 zolfaghari et al 2016 rostami et al 2019 also reported a decrease in the ift at low water salinity but an increase in the ift with a higher salt concentration rostami et al 2019 on the other hand as temperature increases the interfacial viscosity decreases and the thermal energy of the droplets increases resulting in droplet coalescence church et al 2019 we also observed better oil coalescence behaviors with the increased temperature i e at 35 c fig 4 d overall in this study environmental factors like salinity temperature and ss concentration were found to be the most influential parameter affecting for the emulsion stability compared to the thermodynamic properties of cleaners surfactants e g micelle size zeta potential and ift 3 4 practical implications this study was the first to interpret the results of experimental tests using computer vision image analysis combined with machine learning algorithms in the classification or regression of bilgewater emulsion samples to develop a preliminary emulsion stability prediction model using experimental testing an emulsion stability model was developed using ov to help disseminate findings to bilge operators turbidity was also investigated as an alternative indirect indicator of oil separation but it was found that there was no clear relationship between oil coalescence and turbidity in the emulsion samples tested in this study si fig s9 thus oil value is mainly suggested to determine the level of oil coalescence separation which can be applied for practical use on shipboard where the classification or regression is based on the oil coalescence although either one of the models can be selected to provide an appropriate predictive model for the case of the study this study used both models e g classification and regression to show the possibility of the prediction using either classification and regression for emulsion stability with two outputs e g ov and turbidity for example the coalescence stability was classified as belonging to one of three classes mainly oil with more than 66 6 oil separation creaming oil between 33 3 and 66 6 and only creaming with less than 33 3 oil separation the model can also be extended for broader applicability to other non tested surfactants as well as different oils current bilgewater treatment methods do not rely on targeted techniques to increase the effectiveness of emulsion removal therefore this study focused on discovering the effect of variables on emulsion destabilization such that informed research decisions can be pursued the purpose of this work was to contribute to the current understanding of bilgewater emulsion stability and to assist shipboard personnel in identifying why emulsions are creating treatment issues knowledge gained from this study can help inform bilgewater management decisions within the commercial and armed forces vessels for example the methods for characterizing bilgewater emulsion e g ov and predictive models developed in this study can be leveraged by u s navy for recommending bilge cleaners that prevent the generation of stable bilgewater emulsions the insights from this work also aid in improving other fields where oil separation is needed e g oil spill events and oily wastewater treatment using the best ml algorithm results i e rf regressor and rf classifier a public and free web page prototype for bilgewater emulsion stability prediction was created where users enter the information of environmental factors along with surfactant type then the predicted emulsion stability is shown with the number of ov and turbidity ntu si fig s10 the web page was configured to provide a user friendly interface for easy and quick prediction and the source code used for this study was published in github for public access and further development see the si for the source code this study demonstrated that the ml based emulsion stability prediction models using 360 data points showed well predicted coalescence stability and turbidity of the bilgewater emulsion samples however in this study due to a lack of datasets for individual cleaner surfactant specific information representative cleaners surfactant data was used in one analysis of ov and turbidity to improve model accuracy and develop a prediction model also the model s applicability is only confirmed for the surfactants cleaners studied for future experiments with more data from each cleaner emulsion stability prediction modeling both for classification and regression can be improved to consider the use of a specific cleaner a preliminary test of the regression with separated data according to cleaner surfactant type showed a relatively good prediction of oil separation os or ov and turbidity depending on the selected algorithms si table s5 in addition additional properties and experimental data obtained with different environmental parameters can be included in the developed ml model for broader applicability to other non tested surfactants as well as different oils this study showed that the rgb based image processing was successful for determining oil separation with a good agreement with the experimentally determined os values we also explored drawing an oil line as an alternative fig s11 however it was found that determining the oil line between the oil and creaming layers was challenging when a creaming layer is mixed with oil droplets and coalescence oils although it was not further processed in this study a possible solution would be to create a proper assumption for defining the oil lines e g oil line should be over 80 of the separation line and crosscheck with the experimental results with well defined rules of image analysis the use of oil lines would provide an alternative to the current rbg based image processing from collected images various ml algorithms were used to predict bilgewater emulsion stability using the experimental data and image processed data although the use of the proposed ml models for the emulsion prediction may be limited to the tested experimental conditions the work can be expanded with additional parameters e g lower cleaner concentrations 0 5 cmc and low homogenization to improve the model prediction for example some of the physicochemical properties used in this study e g micelle size and zeta potential are intrinsic values of cleaners surfactants and may not represent the emulsion stability after mixing with nsbm the inclusion of more realistic and diverse data e g cmc and itf values in the presence of nsbm would improve the emulsion stability prediction models of non tested surfactants church et al 2021b ml is a method whereby one can predict discrete and numeric values find relationships and clusters and optimize inputs and conditions in the process of emulsion stability analysis there are a variety of applications to which ml can be applied for example we can use ml for optimizing input and condition values to maximize or minimize emulsion stability on the other hand in laboratory experiments it is critical to quickly and accurately find optimal input values and their range e g salinity concentrations that may maximize a target performance e g determining the best oil separation however investigating all possible values is a time consuming labor intensive and expensive process experiments considering multiple parameters can exponentially increase sample sizes and input variables in most cases performing experiments on this scale is infeasible future studies can utilize bayesian optimization bo as an alternative to the ml approach which recommends experimentation to achieve optimal input values maximize a target performance and significantly reduce the experimental time and cost recently materials scientists have applied bo to their laboratory experiments in order to perform effective and accurate determination for complex materials mizoguchi et al 2018 packwood 2017 in a further study of emulsion stability analysis it is expected that the use of bo may help find optimum input values e g the properties of surfactants ph and temperature which maximize or minimize emulsion stability while reducing experimental analysis 4 conclusion in this study ov as a coalescence stability parameter was determined using image processing to predict the bilgewater emulsion stability under different environmental parameters and cleaners surfactants from the anova test cleaner 10 cleaners surfactants ss 0 and 1000 ppm and salinity 0 and 35 000 ppm variables and their interaction significantly affected oil separation i e ov p 0 05 but the variables of ph unadjusted 4 and 10 and temperature 4 25 and 35 c showed no significant impact on ov p 0 05 salinity is the most influential parameter for oil separation of emulsified samples but minimal salinity effect was seen with type 1 and b b this study was the first to use computer image processing and ml for the prediction of oil separation of bilgewater emulsion samples which is of particular interest for the application of bilgewater assessment within the marine sector it is expected that the models developed in this study will aid other researchers as well as those in the field to improve emulsion science and address field related bilge purification issues after modification with more data sets by improving the models with more data better conditions to maximize the oil separation can be recommended under varying scenarios thus

15570,bilgewater is a shipboard multi component oily wastewater combining numerous wastewater sources a better understanding of bilgewater emulsions is required for proper wastewater management to meet discharge regulations in this study we developed 360 emulsion samples based on commonly used navy cleaner data and previous bilgewater composition studies oil value ov was obtained from image analysis of oil creaming layer and validated by oil separation os which was experimentally determined using a gravimetric method ov showed good agreement with os indicating that a simple image based parameter can be used for emulsion stability prediction model development an anova analysis was conducted of the five variables cleaner salinity suspended solids ss ph and temperature that significantly impacted estimates of ov finding that the cleaner salinity and ss variables were statistically significant p 0 05 while ph and temperature were not in general most cleaners showed improved oil separation with salt additions novel machine learning ml based predictive models of both classification and regression for bilgewater emulsion stability were then developed using ov for classification the random forest rf classifiers achieved the most accurate prediction with f1 score of 0 8224 while in regression based models the decision tree dt regressor showed the highest prediction of emulsion stability with the average mean absolute error mae of 0 1611 turbidity also showed a good emulsion prediction with rf regressor mae of 0 0559 and rf classifier f1 score of 0

learning for the prediction of oil separation for the application of bilgewater assessment within the marine sector graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords bilgewater coalescence emulsion stability image processing machine learning oil in water emulsions 1 introduction bilgewater is a shipboard multi component oily wastewater composed of lubricant and hydraulic oils cleaning agents solvents and seawater and must be managed properly to meet the bilgewater discharge regulations with a maximum oil concentration limit of 15 ppm church et al 2019 hwang et al 2021 sharp 1993 however chemically stabilized oil in water o w emulsions formed in bilgewater have been a challenge for oil separation resulting in lower processing rates and decreased operational efficiency of traditional oil water separators ows church et al 2021a in practice the creaming layer of the chemically stabilized emulsion can foul oil sensors while kinetically stable emulsions can pass through the gravity separator e g ows physicochemical properties such as temperature ph suspended solids ss surfactant type and concentration ionic strength e g salinity and mixing intensity were identified as important variables which can impact chemically stabilized o w emulsion stability due to their interaction with the interfacial film between oil and water church et al 2019 diaz et al 2020 for example emulsion stability decreases with salinity ionic strength addition and temperature increase resulting in higher oil separation diaz et al 2020 emulsion stability can also be affected by temperature because of its effect on physical properties and surfactant solubility church et al 2017 detailed hypotheses and assumptions of the effect of physicochemical properties on bilgewater emulsion stability can be found elsewhere church et al 2017 thus a better understanding of these physical and thermodynamic properties of emulsions and surfactant transport behavior is critical to help improve bilgewater treatment and management recently the stability of shipboard oily bilgewater emulsions has been studied extensively to identify governing factors by investigating interfacial tension and droplet coalescence chen and dutcher 2020 chen et al 2020 church et al 2021b davis et al 2021 however due to the time consuming and laborious experimental determination of emulsion stability as well as the complexity of emulsion stability bilgewater treatment methods have often followed an edisonian approach in which an ows is tested against a set of treatment performance criteria rather than investigating the genesis of emulsion formation in relation to the solution s composition despite the increasing concerns of these chemically stabilized emulsions in bilgewater management reliably predicting stability based on basic physicochemical data is not well documented artificial intelligence ai techniques have recently demonstrated potential in overcoming the subjectivity and time consumption associated with conventional techniques in industry unnikrishnan et al 2021 in particular a computer vision analysis integrated with machine learning ml such as mobile microscopy and automated image analysis has gained great attention to create fast cheap location and knowledge independent systems for many use cases pfeil et al 2018 for example the automated image feature extraction was used to characterize droplet formation of pharmaceutical emulsions and numerous ml and deep learning dl models were explored unnikrishnan et al 2021 another example is the classification of morphological and color features for plant seeds in the biodiesel production industry sector isaza et al 2018 isaza et al 2018 used an image analysis technique for the extraction of color and morphological features of plant seeds and well known data mining algorithms were applied to cluster all samples recent advances in computer vision image analysis and data mining techniques

and ml algorithms in order to develop predictive modeling for bilgewater emulsion stability under different environmental conditions e g ph salinity ss cleaner type and temperature both classification and regression modes were developed to investigate the feasibility of ml applications to bilgewater emulsions while classification is to predict a discrete class label output of bilgewater emulsion stability regression is to predict a continuous quantity output as this study recognizes the challenges of the highly variable nature of bilgewater emulsion stability under various conditions e g surfactant and environmental factors this study first collected a useable dataset by conducting well balanced experiments with selected variables e g type of cleaner ph temperature ss and salinity the variables were then included to construct a model that predicts bilgewater emulsion stability which can enable more intentional bilgewater treatment system selection and improved bilgewater management this subject has not been studied in relation to emulsion characterization for bilgewater treatment and management in this study a bilgewater emulsion stability model was newly developed by the following four steps 1 choosing candidate inputs and conditions influencing emulsion stability 2 performing laboratory experiments by applying such inputs and conditions to bilgewater emulsion samples

calla prc and solid surge and alkyl aryl polyether alcohol type 1 the surfactants used in these clears are primarily nonionic but could potentially include other types of surfactants therefore two neat surfactants triton x 100 sigma aldrich cas 9002 93 1 nonionic surfactant and sodium dodecyl sulfate sds sigma aldrich cas 151 21 3 anionic surfactant were compared for reference purposes church et al 2017 emulsion samples were prepared in the total organic carbon toc vial with a total sample volume of 30 ml glc 01020 40 ml qorpak pa usa and carefully cleaned to remove possible contamination

hsu and nacu 2003 after homogenization the vials containing the samples were capped and the oil separation was investigated under an undisturbed condition for 5 days turbidity ntu of the aqueous portion of the emulsion samples was measured after 5 days of undisturbed condition using a turbidimeter hach 2100n co usa baird et al 2012 for the measurement of turbidity the oil and creaming layers were carefully removed from the emulsion samples using a pipette and then the aqueous portion only was transferred into a turbidity cell hach product no 2084900 co usa 2 2 determination of oil value ov using image processing in this study two different ml based emulsion stability models were constructed for predicting 1 coalescence emulsion stability using ov and 2 kinetic emulsion stability using turbidity ov was selected to represent the ability of oil separation in bilgewater e g higher ov such as 1 indicates 100 oil separation while turbidity was selected as an indirect indicator of oil separation thus coalescence stability is the ability for emulsion droplets to coalesce and form a separated oil layer while kinetic stability was defined as the ability for emulsion droplets to stay in suspension in the emulsion layer the prepared emulsion samples consist of three layers oil layer creaming layer and emulsion layer fig 1 a as shown in fig 1 b the layers for coalescence stability are located at the top area of bilgewater samples while the layers for kinetic stability are found below the coalescence stability layers emulsion stability was analyzed based on the formation of an oil layer which is important for bilgewater treatment the images of oil creaming layers of the prepared emulsion samples were obtained at 5 days using a digital camera powershot a480 cannon and a total of 360 images were processed to determine oil value ov for developing emulsion stability models using ml the 5 day image was selected based on the previous study where oil is not observed to further coalesce diaz et al 2020 the major changes occurred within the first day after homogenization an image processing code using opencv bradski 2000 was created to identify the status of oil coalescence in an oil and creaming layer by recording its corresponding color accordingly the perfect creaming state was determined as 0 while the perfect oil separation was determined as 100 ov fig 2 a the height of oil and creaming layers is different with cleaners surfactants as well as environmental conditions si figs s1 s3 non target layers were not considered for image processing and black color was used as a background color in image calibration fig 2 b no image filter was used the rgb color was then normalized to be 255 255 255 for creaming while it was adjusted to be 0 0 0 for oil color the ov was then calculated followed by eq 1 1 oil value ov 255 r g b 3 255 where r g and b are the averages of the total values of red green and blue respectively for example the 1st photo in fig 2 b has a total of 5763 pixels 113 pixels of height and 51 pixels of width in these pixels the rgb values are extracted as a list structure containing values r g and b such as r1 198 g1 185 b1 163 r2 234 g2 218 b2 192 rn 234 gn 218 bn 192 where n 5763 for each color value the sum of the values from the 5763 pixels is averaged e g 198 234 234 5763 then the average colors for r g and b were used in eq 1 the calculated ov was validated with the experimentally determined oil separation os for emulsion samples with a clearly identified oil phase os was calculated using eq 2 by determining the height of the oil layer at 5 days of each emulsion sample using a java based image processing program imagej nih 2 oil separation os height of the separated oil layer total height of the oil used where the total height of the oil in the toc vial was 0 68 cm 3 ml of nsbm 4 oil however some emulsion samples have a simultaneous formation of a creaming and oil layer which made it difficult to determine os by visual inspection in this case os was quantified by a gravimetric method using macro phase separation a preliminary test with the same emulsion samples showed that os values were consistent between gravimetric and height based measurements for the procedure of the gravimetric method the samples at 4 days were gently poured into a separatory funnel pyrex 6402 125 125 ml cole parmer vernon hills il usa and left to settle for 24 h to allow the samples to separate into its oil creaming and oil layer after 24 h which is at 5 days of the total experiment duration the separatory funnel was placed in a holder and the oil layer was collected in a pre weighted beaker and then weighted to determine oil separation using a balance os was then calculated by diving the weight of the collected oil per sample by the weight of the total oil used in the emulsion preparation 2 54 g of 3 ml of nsbm 4 oil all measurements were duplicated standard deviation of 0 3 8 4 2 3 statistical analysis to examine statistical relationships for ov under the experimental conditions one way two way and three way anova were used for hypothesis testing for anova the null hypothesis h 0 was that the mean was the same for all considered groups while the alternative hypothesis h 1 was that at least one of the means was not the same for all considered groups before applying anova to our data we first checked fundamental assumptions that justify its validity i the probability distributions of the residuals were normal normality and ii the variance across groups was homogeneous homoscedasticity to select the best model to fit the data we used akaike s information criterion aic akaike 1974 the aic criteria are used to choose the model which yields the smallest value of aic based on the number of estimated parameters and the maximum likelihood estimate for the model 2 4 development of ml based emulsion stability models 2 4 1 data preprocessing and feature selection for cleaners surfactant information instead of using cleaner surfactant name or type as one of the variables their physicochemical properties total 8 which represent each cleaner surfactant were included in ml modeling table 2 in particular 7 times critical micelle concentration 7 cmc was used to prepare the emulsions to ensure complete coverage of the oil droplet surface hsu and nacu 2003 for the selected factors data normalization was applied by scaling between zero and one 0 1 2 4 2 ml for emulsion stability models the model selection was a downselection process from well known ml algorithms to select the best predictive model two types of ml algorithms regression and classification were used to identify the best emulsion stability prediction model nine regression algorithms were tested in this study deep learning regressor bayesian ridge regressor mackay 1992 random forest regressor decision tree regressor quinlan 1986 gradient boosting regressor multilayer perceptron regressor hinton 1989 linear regressor galton 1886 gaussian process regressor williams and rasmussen 1995 and support vector regressor chang and lin 2011 on the other hand 9 classification algorithms were tested in this study k nearest neighbor classifier gaussian process classifier decision tree classifier random forest classifier ho 2002 multilayer perceptron classifier adaptive boost classifier breiman 1998 and gaussian naive bayes classifier maron 1961 except for the deep learning regressor scikit learn a python based ml library was utilized to develop the regression and classification models with default hyperparameters for the development of the deep learning regressor keras chollet 2017 a python based deep learning library was used a deep learning architecture was selected as this can provide a better prediction result among other architectures see the si for deep learning architecture selection for the ml step the following experimental settings were conducted the total data size was 360 after data preprocessing and it was split into 80 in the training set 288 and 20 in the test set 72 by being randomly taken from the original data for the 80 training set cross validation with 10 folds was applied for model validation in which nine tenth of the training set was randomly selected for developing prediction models and the remaining data from the training set i e one tenth were used for model validation the final cross validation scores were averaged cross validation was used to downselect which models can have a better prediction of emulsion stability the best model selection was then finalized with the test set from downselected models from cross validation for regression mae was used as an evaluation metric i e prediction score normalized from 0 to 1 and a lower number of mae indicates a better prediction of a regression model for classification f1 score was used as an evaluation metric normalized from 0 to 1 and a higher number of f1 score indicates a better prediction of a classification model the target variables were converted to categorical variables with three states low mid and high with 33 3 per each category for ov and turbidity due to imbalanced data e g the number of the low labeled data is higher than the number of the high labeled data the synthetic minority over sampling technique called smote chawla et al 2002 was applied to the data for the classification experiment smote generated more samples using the original data to ensure the balance of the data the experiments were run on a 3 40 ghz intel core i7 3770 processor 2 4 3 sensitivity analysis for predictor variables for ov and turbidity to understand the effects of predictor variables on ov and turbidity an f value test for the sensitivity analysis was performed on the 12 predictor variables to evaluate statistically significant factors the f value test aims to identify parameters that can be used to control and manage the coalescence stability in bilgewater in practice the high score of the f value indicates the high correlation between predictor and target variables f value is a positive numeric value indicating a correlation p i between a predictor variable and target variable eq 2 pedregosa et al 2011 2 p i x i m e a n x i y m e a n y s t d x i s t d y where x is an input matrix for values of the predictor variables and y is a vector for values of the target variables for each predictor variable i we can compute the correlation p i mean and std are the functions for mean and standard deviation respectively f value fi can be computed as shown in the following equation eq 3 pedregosa et al 2011 3 f i p i 2 1 p i 2 n 2 where n denotes the number of samples of y from a f distribution table e g ɑ 0 05 a cutoff of 1 is used to define high correlation in f test f values less than 1 are considered to have less correlation between predictor and target variables 3 results and discussion 3 1 ov acquisition using image processing ov was determined using the oil creaming layer images of the prepared emulsion samples taken at 5 days when there was no noticeable change in appearance visual inspection showed diverse emulsion stabilities with different cleaners surfactants temperatures ss concentrations and salinities si figs s1 s3 fig 3 illustrates that successful acquisition of ov based on image processing of oil and creaming layers was possible and the results resembled os results si figs s4 and s5 in fig 3 green denoted as mainly oil was used for emulsions with more than 66 6 oil separation or samples with coalescence as the main destabilization mechanism yellow creaming oil was used for emulsions presenting an oil layer formation as well as a predominant creaming layer white only creaming was used for samples with less than 33 3 oil separation emulsion separation due to creaming is not definitive and can be easily re dispersed while the formation of an oil layer is typically considered permanent the resulting emulsion stability using the mean of ov from most stable to least stable was type 1 22 b b 47 sds 53 power green 55 triton x 100 63 calla 66 solid surge 67 prc 67 6 afff 69 blast off 87 fig 4 a among 10 cleaners surfactants type 1 showed to produce the most stable emulsion while blast off resulted in the most unstable emulsion highest tendency to coalescence for neat surfactants sds e g anionic surfactant resulted in less oil separation with lower ov indicating greater emulsion stability compared to triton x 100 e g nonionic surfactant 3 2 statistical analysis of ov with different cleaners and environmental conditions an anova analysis was conducted to evaluate the importance of the type of cleaner and various environmental variables e g salinity ss ph and temperature on the determined ov the 360 samples si table s2 were composed of 3 categorical variables cleaner salinity and ss and 3 quantitative variables ph temperature and ov we considered different combinations of the five explanatory variables with a balanced design to investigate their effects on ov for one way anova the p values of cleaner ss and salinity were less than 0 05 implying that there is strong evidence that the means of ov for cleaners ss and salinity were not the same this indicates that the type of cleaner ss and salinity have significant impacts on ov although temperature was marginally significant with p values of 0 057 it was excluded from the final model selection procedure for clear interpretation ph showed high p values 0 429 implying that the experimental data did not support the variable of ph affecting ov in the experiments this finding does not mean that ph and temperature are not important to oil coalescence and emulsion stability even though ph and temperature are important chemical parameters for determining emulsion stability chen and tao 2005 kokal 2002 the current data could not discern a significant impact with respect to ov for the studied systems this is likely because of builders and other additives commonly found in cleaners that enable efficacy in a wide range of conditions church et al 2021b further anova analysis was conducted with the selected three significant variables cleaner ss and salinity for the two way anova additive model the effects of the type of cleaner ss and salinity on ov were statistically significant p 0 05 for every combination of the two variables similarly for three way anova additive and interaction models the effects of the three variables were significant p 0 05 only except for the three way interaction term from the aic results the three way anova with an interaction model with cleaner ss and salinity variables was selected as the best fit model with the lowest aic value 124 72 and 100 of the aic weight si table s3 this means that the selected model explains 100 of the total variation in the dependent variable ov that can be explained by the full set of considered models in diagnostic plots si fig s6 it was found that the selected model satisfied the anova assumptions because the residuals had approximately similar spreads at the fitted values for all groups one could assume the homogeneity of variances the q q plot shows the linearity of the points which suggests that the data are normally distributed although there were potential outliers that could affect the assumptions the deviations were minimal descriptive statistics showed the variations based on two different concentrations of ss and salinity for example the means of ov were clearly different between 0 ppm ss 0 54 and 1000 ppm ss 0 66 fig 4 b the means of ov between 0 ppm salinity 0 41 and 35 000 ppm salinity 0 78 were also different from each other fig 4 c these indicate the positive effect of ss and salinity on oil separation of the bilgewater emulsion samples although temperature was found statistically insignificant in 95 confidence p values of 0 057 the trend of increased ov was found with increased temperature fig 4 d higher ss concentration salinity and temperature reduced emulsion stability and promoted oil separation according to the results of the tukey kramer test we distinguished different combinations of three variables into six cleaner ss eight cleaner salinity and three ss salinity groups si table s4 the groups with the same letter were not significantly different from each other in the lettered grouping in terms of the mean of ov fig 5 depicts box plots of the data grouped by the combination of the types of the cleaner and ss variables fig 5 a and cleaner and salinity variables fig 5 b the lettered group from the tukey kramer test si table s4 is also illustrated above each of the box plots the same lettered group of box plots indicates that they are not statistically different while a different lettered group indicates that the difference between groups is statistically significant for example in fig 5 b 6 afff b b calla sds solid surge and triton x have different groups between 0 and 35 000 of salinity showing that these cleaners surfactants present a salinity effect on their emulsion stability higher salinity for these cleaners surfactants resulted in higher ov indicating better oil separation however blast off power green prc and type 1 contained at least one same group between 0 and 35 000 of salinity indicating that the salinity effect is statistically insignificant for these cleaners surfactants in general higher salinity resulted in higher ov indicating a more coalesced oil layer however throughout the analysis it was also found that there were significantly different means of ov based on the type of cleaner for example regardless of the presence of ss and salinity blast off showed the highest ov while type 1 and b b showed low ov even with high salinity one interesting observation was that calla power green prc solid surge and triton x 100 which are in the middle range of ov 0 44 0 63 showed a wide spread of ov between 0 and 1 regardless of the presence of ss and salinity fig 5 fig 6 displays box plots of the data grouped by the combination of ss and salinity while higher ss destabilized the o w emulsion improving the oil separation in the absence of salinity once salinity becomes high 35 000 ppm in the emulsion the effect of ss on oil separation was negligible a greater ov for emulsion samples with high salinity would be expected as high ionic strength conditions provide a significant impact on emulsion stability lowering zeta potential and thus increasing droplet interaction kulmyrzaev et al 2000 this interaction can increase oil coalescence with salinity addition lowering emulsion stability church et al 2017 particularly the bilgewater samples prepared with 6 afff b b calla sds solid surge and triton x were characterized for their high ov in the presence of salinity fig 5 b this could be explained by the low resistance of electrostatically stabilized emulsions to saline conditions it was also known that the aqueous phase salinity can affect the solubility of the emulsifier which can impact the stability at the interface or cause the drag out of the surfactant e g ionic surfactants iyota and krastev 2009 this indicates that at sufficient ionic strengths fast coalescence resulting in major phase separation will likely occur on the other hand some cots cleaners showed different results regardless of their primary surfactants for example b b prc and calla have the same primary surfactant i e alcohol ethoxylate but b b and calla showed oil separation with the salinity while prc showed no significant effect of salinity on the prc emulsion samples it seems that unknown compounds that are included in the cots cleaners seem to have more governing effects on emulsion stability compared to salinity 3 3 emulsion stability prediction model 3 3 1 ov prediction model regression and classification using the acquired ov regression and classification models were constructed to predict the emulsion stability and compared each other for regression models nine regression algorithms were compared with the mae scores as shown in table 3 which lists two results i e validation and test results for each algorithm the validation results were the averaged maes for the cross validations with 10 folds for ov the decision tree dt regressor shows the most accurate results 0 1611 of mae among other algorithms random forest rf regressor was the next selection for the prediction with 0 1834 of mae both random forest rf and decision tree dt regressor algorithms are based on ensemble learning in which simple predictive models e g decision trees collaborate to predict a target value rf is known as one of the most widely used supervised algorithms without too much hyper parameter tuning and it merges various decision trees to avoid overfitting and get a robust prediction han et al 2019 for two models dt and rf for ov the comparison between the actual and predicted ov values were similar indicating well performed predictive models for emulsion stability although there are two extreme cases for the actual values of zero 100 creaming layer and one 100 oil layer si fig s7 to ensure whether the current datasets 360 are sufficient to obtain a good prediction model a set of analyses in which various data sizes from 90 to 360 were applied with the rf model was performed to investigate the proper size of data although there is still room for improvement the current data size of 360 was found to be sufficient from averaged mae values for regression and f 1 scores for classification si fig s8 for classification models three categories that are equally divided less than 33 3 between 33 3 and 66 6 greater than 66 6 have been used for ov and seven classification algorithms were compared with the f1 scores as shown in table 3 the validation results were the averages of f1 scores for the cross validations with 10 folds the test result of ov was 0 8224 with rf classifier indicating a good prediction of the classification of emulsion stability overall the ml models using image processed values ov showed acceptable prediction in coalescence stability with the dt regressor for the regression model and the rf classifier for classification 3 3 2 turbidity prediction model regression and classification prediction models for kinetic stability using turbidity values were developed using regression and classification algorithms for this the same set of regression and classification algorithms with coalescence stability analysis was used for the regression test the rf regressor achieved the highest mae score of 0 0559 while for the classification test the rf classifier obtained the highest f1 score of 0 9338 among tested algorithms table 3 both regression and classification tests showed that the ml approach is applicable to predict the turbidity value with high accuracy 3 3 3 the effect of predictor variables on the prediction of ov and turbidity table 4 lists the results of the f value test for 12 predictor variables for ov and turbidity for ov salinity showed the strongest correlation with the target variables with the f value of 112 the results agreed with the statistical analysis and previous studies church et al 2017 where salt concentration was found to be a master variable for controlling the coalescence stability of emulsions the effect of other variables on the ov prediction was minimal for turbidity micelle size showed the highest correlation with the f value of 46 and the salinity showed the next correlation with the kinetic stability variables other than salinity and micelle size showed a relatively low impact on the emulsion stability prediction the effects of ss ph and temperature were not found to be significant in ov prediction in this sensitivity analysis however sensitivity analysis provides a rough correlation considering their linearity and thus it may be difficult to determine whether the parameter is sensitive when the f value is in the middle or low range therefore an additional sensitivity analysis a one predictor variable removal test was performed for further analysis of the effect of an individual variable on ov and turbidity prediction 3 3 4 one predictor variable removal test for ov and turbidity as the f value test provides only rough information in correlation for each predictor variable we performed another sensitivity analysis a one predictor variable removal test in which one of the predictor variables is removed one by one from the set of the 12 predictor variables and the remaining predictor variables are used for ml and each prediction test then the results of the original prediction test are compared with the results from the one predictor variable removal test table 5 shows the results of the one predictor variable removal test for ov and turbidity in regression models the first row of each ov and turbidity denotes the mae results from each original prediction test the following rows present each variable that is removed for the test for example in the second row of ov the variable surfactant concentration was removed from 12 predictor variables and the remaining 11 predictor variables were used for ml for ov prediction followed by each regression test the values in the cells below the first row denote the differences between the original prediction test and each test therefore the positive value in each cell means that the value may positively influence the prediction result while the negative value in each cell means that the value may negatively influence the prediction result and should be removed from the consideration to improve the prediction for example in the column of the dt regressor which was the most accurate model for ov prediction when the predictor variable salinity was removed from the model the model accuracy went down from the original 0 1611 to 0 4142 with a difference of 0 2531 indicating that salinity is the most influential parameter among 12 predictor variables to improve the accuracy there were no negative values in the one predictor variable removal tests with the selected ml models for ov and turbidity indicating that all 12 variables are meaningful variables for both coalescence and kinetic emulsion stability prediction in the dt regressor with ov environmental parameters such as salinity temperature and ss seem to be the most influential factors for emulsion stability prediction compared to other variables in the rf regressor model for turbidity salinity was the most influential factor for the kinetic stability followed by ph and temperature the results of the one predictor variable removal test are in good agreement with findings observed in literature as well as the anova model section 3 2 in general salinity and temperature are known to play significant roles in emulsion stability zolfaghari et al 2016 many studies have reported the effect of salinity or ionic strength on the oil in water emulsion stability due to surfactant adsorption behavior and a reduction in the ift hezave et al 2013 water salinity is known to be an important parameter for spontaneous emulsification for oil in water systems davis et al 2020 in our previous study it was observed that emulsion samples with high concentrations of nacl were found to be less stable church et al 2017 this is because of an effect called salting out which reduces the hydrophilicity of surfactants and diminishes the solubility of surfactants in the aqueous phase thus decreasing an o w emulsion stability martínez palou et al 2013 zolfaghari et al 2016 rostami et al 2019 also reported a decrease in the ift at low water salinity but an increase in the ift with a higher salt concentration rostami et al 2019 on the other hand as temperature increases the interfacial viscosity decreases and the thermal energy of the droplets increases resulting in droplet coalescence church et al 2019 we also observed better oil coalescence behaviors with the increased temperature i e at 35 c fig 4 d overall in this study environmental factors like salinity temperature and ss concentration were found to be the most influential parameter affecting for the emulsion stability compared to the thermodynamic properties of cleaners surfactants e g micelle size zeta potential and ift 3 4 practical implications this study was the first to interpret the results of experimental tests using computer vision image analysis combined with machine learning algorithms in the classification or regression of bilgewater emulsion samples to develop a preliminary emulsion stability prediction model using experimental testing an emulsion stability model was developed using ov to help disseminate findings to bilge operators turbidity was also investigated as an alternative indirect indicator of oil separation but it was found that there was no clear relationship between oil coalescence and turbidity in the emulsion samples tested in this study si fig s9 thus oil value is mainly suggested to determine the level of oil coalescence separation which can be applied for practical use on shipboard where the classification or regression is based on the oil coalescence although either one of the models can be selected to provide an appropriate predictive model for the case of the study this study used both models e g classification and regression to show the possibility of the prediction using either classification and regression for emulsion stability with two outputs e g ov and turbidity for example the coalescence stability was classified as belonging to one of three classes mainly oil with more than 66 6 oil separation creaming oil between 33 3 and 66 6 and only creaming with less than 33 3 oil separation the model can also be extended for broader applicability to other non tested surfactants as well as different oils current bilgewater treatment methods do not rely on targeted techniques to increase the effectiveness of emulsion removal therefore this study focused on discovering the effect of variables on emulsion destabilization such that informed research decisions can be pursued the purpose of this work was to contribute to the current understanding of bilgewater emulsion stability and to assist shipboard personnel in identifying why emulsions are creating treatment issues knowledge gained from this study can help inform bilgewater management decisions within the commercial and armed forces vessels for example the methods for characterizing bilgewater emulsion e g ov and predictive models developed in this study can be leveraged by u s navy for recommending bilge cleaners that prevent the generation of stable bilgewater emulsions the insights from this work also aid in improving other fields where oil separation is needed e g oil spill events and oily wastewater treatment using the best ml algorithm results i e rf regressor and rf classifier a public and free web page prototype for bilgewater emulsion stability prediction was created where users enter the information of environmental factors along with surfactant type then the predicted emulsion stability is shown with the number of ov and turbidity ntu si fig s10 the web page was configured to provide a user friendly interface for easy and quick prediction and the source code used for this study was published in github for public access and further development see the si for the source code this study demonstrated that the ml based emulsion stability prediction models using 360 data points showed well predicted coalescence stability and turbidity of the bilgewater emulsion samples however in this study due to a lack of datasets for individual cleaner surfactant specific information representative cleaners surfactant data was used in one analysis of ov and turbidity to improve model accuracy and develop a prediction model also the model s applicability is only confirmed for the surfactants cleaners studied for future experiments with more data from each cleaner emulsion stability prediction modeling both for classification and regression can be improved to consider the use of a specific cleaner a preliminary test of the regression with separated data according to cleaner surfactant type showed a relatively good prediction of oil separation os or ov and turbidity depending on the selected algorithms si table s5 in addition additional properties and experimental data obtained with different environmental parameters can be included in the developed ml model for broader applicability to other non tested surfactants as well as different oils this study showed that the rgb based image processing was successful for determining oil separation with a good agreement with the experimentally determined os values we also explored drawing an oil line as an alternative fig s11 however it was found that determining the oil line between the oil and creaming layers was challenging when a creaming layer is mixed with oil droplets and coalescence oils although it was not further processed in this study a possible solution would be to create a proper assumption for defining the oil lines e g oil line should be over 80 of the separation line and crosscheck with the experimental results with well defined rules of image analysis the use of oil lines would provide an alternative to the current rbg based image processing from collected images various ml algorithms were used to predict bilgewater emulsion stability using the experimental data and image processed data although the use of the proposed ml models for the emulsion prediction may be limited to the tested experimental conditions the work can be expanded with additional parameters e g lower cleaner concentrations 0 5 cmc and low homogenization to improve the model prediction for example some of the physicochemical properties used in this study e g micelle size and zeta potential are intrinsic values of cleaners surfactants and may not represent the emulsion stability after mixing with nsbm the inclusion of more realistic and diverse data e g cmc and itf values in the presence of nsbm would improve the emulsion stability prediction models of non tested surfactants church et al 2021b ml is a method whereby one can predict discrete and numeric values find relationships and clusters and optimize inputs and conditions in the process of emulsion stability analysis there are a variety of applications to which ml can be applied for example we can use ml for optimizing input and condition values to maximize or minimize emulsion stability on the other hand in laboratory experiments it is critical to quickly and accurately find optimal input values and their range e g salinity concentrations that may maximize a target performance e g determining the best oil separation however investigating all possible values is a time consuming labor intensive and expensive process experiments considering multiple parameters can exponentially increase sample sizes and input variables in most cases performing experiments on this scale is infeasible future studies can utilize bayesian optimization bo as an alternative to the ml approach which recommends experimentation to achieve optimal input values maximize a target performance and significantly reduce the experimental time and cost recently materials scientists have applied bo to their laboratory experiments in order to perform effective and accurate determination for complex materials mizoguchi et al 2018 packwood 2017 in a further study of emulsion stability analysis it is expected that the use of bo may help find optimum input values e g the properties of surfactants ph and temperature which maximize or minimize emulsion stability while reducing experimental analysis 4 conclusion in this study ov as a coalescence stability parameter was determined using image processing to predict the bilgewater emulsion stability under different environmental parameters and cleaners surfactants from the anova test cleaner 10 cleaners surfactants ss 0 and 1000 ppm and salinity 0 and 35 000 ppm variables and their interaction significantly affected oil separation i e ov p 0 05 but the variables of ph unadjusted 4 and 10 and temperature 4 25 and 35 c showed no significant impact on ov p 0 05 salinity is the most influential parameter for oil separation of emulsified samples but minimal salinity effect was seen with type 1 and b b this study was the first to use computer image processing and ml for the prediction of oil separation of bilgewater emulsion samples which is of particular interest for the application of bilgewater assessment within the marine sector it is expected that the models developed in this study will aid other researchers as well as those in the field to improve emulsion science and address field related bilge purification issues after modification with more data sets by improving the models with more data better conditions to maximize the oil separation can be recommended under varying scenarios thus

15571,microplastics as emerging pollutants have been heavily accumulated in the waste activated sludge was during biological wastewater treatment which showed significantly diverse impacts on the subsequent anaerobic sludge digestion for methane production however a robust modeling approach for predicting and unveiling the complex effects of accumulated microplastics within was on methane production is still missing in this study four automated machine learning automl approach was applied to model the effects of microplastics on anaerobic digestion processes and integrated explainable analysis was explored to reveal the relationships between key variables e g concentration type and size of microplastics and methane production the results showed that the gradient boosting machine had better prediction performance mean squared error mse 17 0 than common neural networks models mse 58 0 demonstrating that the automl algorithms succeeded in predicting the methane production and could select the best machine learning model without human intervention explainable analysis results indicated that the variable of microplastic types was more important than the variable of microplastic diameter and concentration the existence of polystyrene was associated with higher methane production whereas increasing microplastic diameter and concentration both inhibited methane production this work also provided a novel modeling approach for comprehensively understanding the complex effects of microplastics on methane production which revealed the dependence relationships between methane production and key variables and may be served as a reference for optimizing operational adjustments in anaerobic digestion processes graphical abstract image graphical abstract

used is confidential 1 introduction the prevalence of microplastics in natural environments has become an emerging problem due to diverse anthropogenic activities such as agriculture aquaculture and tourism that discard microplastics during production and usage deng et al 2021 li et al 2020b wang et al 2020 the majority of these microplastics within domestic and industrial wastewater will enter the wastewater treatment systems more than 90 of microplastics have been found to be accumulated in waste activated sludge was which can serve as digestion substrates for anaerobic digestion hatinoglu and sanin 2021 the existence of microplastics may affect the production rate of methane in anaerobic digestion because they had a great influence on the activity of the anaerobe such as hydrolysis acidification and methanogenesis activities feng et al 2018 wei et al 2019a moreover during anaerobic digestion processes the deterioration of microplastics may occur which will reduce the size of microplastics to a nanometer level hatinoglu and sanin 2021 these nanoplastics will infiltrate into the microbial cells and produce reactive oxygen species ros bringing inhibitory effects on the activity of microbial communities zhang and chen 2020 therefore the effects of microplastics on anaerobic digestion processes highly depend on their concentration physicochemical properties and contact time hatinoglu and sanin 2021 li et al 2020a wei et al 2019b machine learning ml models provide the capacity to solve nonlinear classification and regression tasks by extracting internal information and learning patterns from big data huang et al 2021 xu et al 2021a 2020b for microplastics in environments several ml models have been developed to classify or identify microplastics cowger et al 2020 post et al 2021 yurtsever and yurtsever 2019 for example the combination of the deep uv raman spectrometer and convolutional neural networks could detect the most widespread microplastics in aquatic systems post et al 2021 ml models also could automatically count and classify microplastic particles from pictures lorenzo navarro et al 2021 however current ml models were all established based on the image like data of microplastics the increasing data availability in the literature related to anaerobic digestion with different microplastics could help the establishment of ml models for modeling the complex effects of microplastics on anaerobic digestion processes relating to their concentration and physicochemical properties chen et al 2021 wei et al 2019a 2019b in the traditional development of ml models experts heavily participate in the entire design procedure of ml models i e feature engineering model selection algorithm selection hyperparameter tuning etc which are time consuming and cannot be easily redesigned by non experts abd elrahman et al 2020 ferreira et al 2021 to this end several automated machine learning automl frameworks such as auto sklearn feurer et al 2020 2015 tree based pipeline optimization tool tpot le et al 2020 olson et al 2016 genetic automated machine learning assistant gama gijsbers and vanschoren 2019 autogluon erickson et al 2020 and h2o automl ledell 2020 has been proposed to take the human out of these ml applications by automatically comparing and deploying high performance ml models these automl frameworks have been successfully applied in other fields including crash severity prediction angarita zapata et al 2021 devices classification seo et al 2021 and epidemiology prediction liu et al 2022 nevertheless automl frameworks have not been tested in modeling the effects of microplastics on anaerobic digestion processes by using automl frameworks the relationships among variables related to methane production in anaerobic digestion processes may be promising to be discovered and the accurate prediction of methane production could be achieved without frequent manual intervention therefore this study aims to model the effects of microplastics on anaerobic digestion processes through diverse automl algorithms and interpret these models via explainable analysis to reveal the relationships between key variables e g concentration type and size of microplastics and methane production the big data in the literature related to anaerobic digestion with different microplastics were collected and analyzed first then the performance of different automl algorithms in predicting methane production was compared the relationships among model variables were evaluated by explainable methods embedded in automl algorithms these results may improve the understanding of the effects of microplastics on methane production and help the enhancement of methane production through interaction mechanisms caused by microplastics moreover the advent of automl algorithms may immensely accelerate advancement in revealing the internal biochemical mechanisms through big data scattered in the literature 2 materials and methods 2 1 data extraction and analysis previous studies had reported that the existence of microplastics in digested substrates had a significant influence on methane production in anaerobic digestion processes wei et al 2019a 2019b zhang et al 2020 the accumulation of methane was also greatly affected by the characteristics of microplastics e g types concentrations and sizes in the anaerobic digestion reactors hatinoglu and sanin 2021 therefore a comprehensive literature search was carried out on the web of science to collect data about the methane production in anaerobic digestion processes exposed to different microplastics the search terms including microplastics or microplastic or nanoplastics or nanoplastic and methane or ch4 were used to search relevant literature the content of searched literature was examined and finally five studies were selected because they have consistent variables related to methane production table 1 from the five studies 871 methane production data points were mined to form a qualified dataset six input variables including digestion time d microplastic types microplastic diameter μm microplastic concentration g l substrate types and concentration mg cod l were chosen the dataset contained six different types of microplastic i e polystyrene polystyrene nh2 polystyrene so3h polyethylene polyvinyl chloride and polyester and two types of digested substrate i e glucose and waste activated sludge which were represented as categorical objects in the dataset the accumulated methane production ml during the anaerobic digestion processes was selected as the output variable the values of numerical objects such as digestion time d microplastic diameter μm microplastic concentration g l substrate concentration mg cod l and methane production ml were extracted manually using the digitizer function in the originpro 2022 originlab corporation northampton usa the values of all numerical objects were transformed into unified units table 1 respectively the relationships among input and output variables in the dataset were first illustrated by exploratory data analysis eda which can visualize the entire distribution of pairwise variables along the timeline moreover the pearson product moment correlation coefficient ppmc was calculated to further evaluate the correlations among variables in the collected dataset based on the following equation bennett et al 2013 1 r i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 where x i y i is the evaluated data pair and x and y are mean values of the variables ppmc calculates the linear correlation between two series of data and lies between 1 and 1 a ppmc value close to 1 indicates a high correlation between two variables bennett et al 2013 xu et al 2021c 2 2 implementation of automl four types of famous automl methods including tpot le et al 2020 olson et al 2016 gama gijsbers and vanschoren 2019 autogluon erickson et al 2020 and h2o automl ledell 2020 were selected to simulate the complex effects of accumulated microplastics within was on methane production because these four automl methods performed well on regression tasks in many fields angarita zapata et al 2021 ferreira et al 2020 2021 these automl methods can automatically select ml models and stack ensembles based on different algorithms and training strategies and can help design the optimized ml models in a limited amount of time ferreira et al 2021 2 2 1 tpot the tpot utilizes genetic programming to automatically design and optimize ml pipelines and then provides the python code for the best ml pipeline fig s1 three types of preprocessors i e standard scaler robust scaler and polynomial features can be implemented to preprocess tabular data several supervised learning models including individual and ensemble tree based models non probabilistic and probabilistic linear models and k nearest neighbors are optional in the tpot the tabular dataset will successively flow through these pipeline operators that will add remove or modify the features in the dataset then the final predictions are utilized to evaluate the overall accuracy of the ml pipelines fig s2 the detailed implementation of the tpot can be found at https github com epistasislab tpot 2 2 2 gama similar to tpot gama also utilizes genetic programming to generate optimized ml pipelines with qualified datasets and limited computational time the pipeline of gama is consistent with the pipeline of tpot consisting of data preprocessing ml algorithm selection and hyperparameter fine tuning the major difference between tpot and gama lies in the different evolutionary algorithms tpot utilizes a synchronous evolutionary algorithm whereas gama uses an asynchronous algorithm which can make use of computing resources better moreover gama focuses more on extensibility and research friendliness by using different search strategies ensembling post processing steps and visualizing the optimization process some famous ml algorithms e g random forest support vector machine and gaussian naive bayes and their ensembles are considered in the gama more information about the gama can be found at https openml labs github io gama master index html 2 2 3 autogluon the autogluon an open source automl framework can automatically recognize the data type in each column and identify the modeling task i e binary multi class classification or regression based on data in the label column then the autogluon will randomly divide the dataset into various folds for model training vs validation individually fits various models i e neural networks lightgbm boosted trees catboost boosted trees random forests extremely randomized trees k nearest neighbors and finally creates an optimized model ensemble that outperforms any of the individual trained models the network architecture used by autogluon is illustrated in fig s3 a a multi layer stacking strategy is proposed in the autogluon fig s3 b the detailed description of the autogluon is available at https auto gluon ai stable index html 2 2 4 h2o automl the h2o automl provides a distributed ml learning platform with a single function for fully automated training candidate models and stacked ensembles in a short amount of time all candidate models will be listed on a leaderboard depending on diverse model performance metrics training time or average prediction speed the combination of fast random search and stacked ensembles is applied in the h2o automl to train various algorithms such as random forest xgboost gradient boosting machines gbm generalized linear models and deep neural networks the manual of h2o automl could be found at https h2o release s3 amazonaws com h2o rel zorn 2 docs website h2o docs welcome html 2 2 5 evaluation of the four automl algorithms in this study the raw dataset collected from the literature was randomly divided into 80 training dataset and 20 test dataset then these automl algorithms were conducted in a range of time 60 2400s and their regression performance was compared based on mathematical metrics such as mean squared error mse root mean squared error rmse and mean absolute error mae 2 mse 1 n i 1 n y i y i 2 3 rmse 1 n i 1 n y i y i 2 4 mae 1 n i 1 n y i y i where y i is the predicted value and y i is the true value all predictions were carried out five times and the best performance of these automl algorithms was recorded and compared 2 3 explainable analysis methods the results of the leader models generated by automl algorithms were interpreted by integrated explainable methods including residual analysis variable importance variable importance heatmap shapley additive explanations shap summary and partial dependence plots pdp these explainable methods were directly conducted in python code the implementation of these explainable methods is available at https h2o release s3 amazonaws com h2o rel zorn 2 docs website h2o docs explain html the residual analysis was utilized to plot the fitted values vs residuals on a test dataset mathematically the residual for a data point is the difference between the response value y and the predicted value ŷ the random distribution of residuals suggests that the ml model fits the data well whereas the systematic pattern of residuals implies that the ml model fits the data poorly cui et al 2020 the variable importance of each variable scaled between 0 and 100 can be calculated according to the relative influence of each variable on the tree based ml models whether that variable was selected to split on during the tree building process and how much the squared error over all trees improved decreased as a result ledell 2020 moreover the variable importance heatmap was used to present variable importance across multiple models which are ordered by their similarity shap summary plots can succinctly present the magnitude prevalence and direction of each variable related to the response value song et al 2020 the marginal effects of each variable on methane production were evaluated by the shap values then the dependence relationships of important variables on methane production were further examined by pdp friedman 2001 wang et al 2021 3 results and discussion 3 1 overview of the collected datasets the characteristics of all selected variables are shown in table 1 a wide range of digestion time 0 88 59 d in the collected dataset represented the entire digestion of digested substrates xu et al 2020c the microplastics with micro and nano size 0 07 1000 μm were both included in the collected dataset the size of microplastics affects the interactions between microplastics and microorganisms the larger microplastics can provide adsorption sites for microorganisms whereas the smaller microplastics may penetrate the microbial cells and cause cytotoxicity wei et al 2019b zhang and chen 2020 meanwhile a small range of microplastic concentration 0 0 33 g l was investigated in the literature indeed the concentrations of microplastic in was vary largely from 510 to 495 000 particle kg dry weight and highly depend on the types of wastewater hatinoglu and sanin 2021 to further reveal the general condition of collected datasets the numeric relationships between pairwise variables along the digestion time were analyzed by eda as shown in fig 1 a the accumulated methane production gradually improved with the increased digestion time much higher methane production was achieved under the polystyrene type 0 with small microplastic diameters 0 08 5 μm meanwhile methane production clearly decreased with the increasing concentration of microplastics which caused higher toxicity to both acidogens and methanogens wei et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 moreover the addition of glucose 2000 5200 mg cod l as digested substrate led to higher methane production than the addition of was 9040 10 480 mg cod l which may be due to the much higher bio assimilation rate of glucose than that of was the linear correlation between pairwise variables in the collected dataset was analyzed by ppmc as illustrated in fig 1 b the digestion time presented a weak positive correlation to methane production moreover microplastic types and substrate types were negatively correlated with methane production meanwhile methane production did not present a linear correlation with microplastic diameter microplastic concentration and substrate concentration therefore the internal relationships among these variables should be further discovered based on big data and nonlinear methods 3 2 methane production predicted by automl algorithms four types of famous automl algorithms i e tpot gama autogluon and h2o automl were applied to automatically generate optimized ml models for predicting methane production based on microplastic and substrate data a large range of training time i e 60 2400s was tested for each automl algorithm as shown in fig 2 a with the increase in training time tpot generated more model generations and compared their test performance as a result the test mse of the tpot gradually decreased from 31 3 to 11 3 indicating that the optimized model created by the tpot successfully learned the nonlinear relationships among variables the xgboost generated by the tpot achieved the best test performance mse 11 3 than other ml models e g random forest extremely randomized trees and k nearest neighbors generated by the tpot akin to the tpot the test mse of the gama also decreased from 40 9 to 12 8 with the increase in training time meanwhile the gama evaluated more ml models than the tpot within the same time due to their different evolutionary algorithms gijsbers and vanschoren 2019 the gama determined that the gbm was the best ml model with an mse of 12 8 for the collected dataset autogluon as an intelligent automl algorithm can infer the modeling task e g binary multiclass and regression based on the response data in the dataset and identify the type of each variable i e which columns contain continuous numbers vs discrete categories erickson et al 2020 therefore the implementation of autogluon requires minimal code and minimal pre processing for datasets all types of models trained by the autogluon are listed in table 2 with the increase in training time more types of models were generated and evaluated by the autogluon which will skip some models when there is not enough time left to train these models erickson et al 2020 as a result the validation and test mse of the ml models generated by autogluon both decreased to the same level that was similar to the performance of tpot and gama the catboost was the best ml algorithm with the mse of 17 0 chosen by the autogluon meanwhile the common neural network models were also tested by the autogluon i e neuralnetmxnet in table 2 comparatively gbm based models e g catboost lightgbm xgboost presented much better performance than the neural network models table 2 these results highlighted that the automl algorithm is conducive to finding the optimized ml models for a specific dataset angarita zapata et al 2021 seo et al 2021 for h2o automl the top 20 ml models with the highest prediction accuracy h2o automl consisted of gbm and stacked ensemble table s1 similar to the autogluon the h2o automl confirmed that the gbm was the most effective ml model for understanding the internal relationships between methane production and input variables fig 3 comparatively the h2o automl presented a quicker training speed than the autogluon fig 3 moreover the results of gbm could be interpreted by explainable methods embedded in the h2o automl ledell 2020 which are essential to revealing the true effects of microplastics on methane production ferreira et al 2020 overall all four automl algorithms successfully predicted methane production based on the collected microplastic dataset after a long period of training similarly ferreira et al 2020 utilized real world datasets to compare the performance of different automl algorithms they also found that all automl algorithms obtained high quality results and did not present substantial predictive differences these results indicated that there was indeed an internal relationship between methane production and these input variables i e digestion time microplastic types microplastic diameter microplastic concentration substrate types and concentration interestingly gbm based models e g catboost lightgbm xgboost rather than neural networks achieved better performance in predicting methane production the interpretability of gbm based models is also better than the neural networks with deep structures lundberg et al 2020 rudin 2019 the high quality prediction made by the gbm based models paves the way for correctly interpreting modeling results through explainable analysis 3 3 the importance analysis for variables related to methane production to achieve accurate prediction performance it is essential to interpret these model results to reveal the effects of microplastics on methane production to achieve this integrated explainable methods i e residual analysis variable importance variable importance heatmap shap summary and pdp plots were applied the performance of the optimized gbm was first analyzed by the residual analysis which displays the distribution of residuals on the test dataset a high frequency of residuals was found around zero especially for the lower methane production 0 160 ml fig 4 a indicating that the trained gbm has acquired sufficient predictive information cui et al 2020 liyanaarachchi et al 2021 the variable importance was then evaluated for each variable on the methane production which was found to follow the order of types of microplastic digestion time types of substrate concentration of substrate diameter of microplastic concentration of microplastic fig 4 b the variable importance across multiple models was also illustrated in the variable importance heatmap fig 4 c the importance of microplastic types was highlighted in all gbm models generated by the h2o automl at 2100s these results revealed that the types of microplastic presented the highest importance in affecting methane production on one hand the interactions between extracellular polymeric substances eps surrounding the microbial cells and microplastics rely on the features and textures of microplastics e g functional groups surface charges and hydrophobicity deng et al 2021 feng et al 2018 hatinoglu and sanin 2021 previous studies have found that microparticles with sulfate groups had greater sorption capacity onto microorganisms than that functionalized with amine or carboxyl groups feng et al 2018 peulen and wilkinson 2011 the cationic polystyrene nh2 caused more adverse effects on methane production than the anionic polystyrene so3h implying that different functional groups and surface charges of microplastics decided the penetration of microplastics in the eps matrix feng et al 2018 peulen and wilkinson 2011 on the other hand the biotoxicity of microplastics was found to be highly related to their leachates e g plastic additives wei et al 2019a zhang and chen 2020 plastic additives released from different microplastics may pose different effects on the microorganisms associated with methane production for example leachate caprolactam from polyamide 6 microplastics as one type of special plastic additive may affect methane production through binding onto relevant enzyme molecules chen et al 2021 the low level of caprolactam improved the affinity of enzymes with substrates and their catalytical activity whereas higher concentrations of caprolactam might occupy active sites of these enzymes and weaken the promoting effect of caprolactam chen et al 2021 however wei et al 2019a found that the nontoxic acetyl tri n butyl citrate additives leaching from polyethylene microplastics had a negligible effect on anaerobic digestion instead the inhibition of methane production was attributed to the ros induced by polyethylene microplastics wei et al 2019a therefore the effects of microplastics on microbial metabolisms and diversity highly depend on the features textures and plastic additives of microplastics however the effect of microplastic types was difficult to be compared directly among different literature hatinoglu and sanin 2021 the explainable analysis of big data collected from literature provided the capacity to overcome this issue the importance of digestion time on methane production is consistent with the widely accepted point that anaerobic digestion consists of four continuous stages i e hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis and thus enough digestion time is required to convert substrate to methane du et al 2021 liu et al 2021 xu et al 2021b interestingly the substrate types and concentrations showed higher importance than the microplastic diameter and concentrations glucose and was were two types of substrates used in all collected literature table 1 glucose is an easily absorbed substrate whereas the was has intrinsic drawbacks in anaerobic digestion such as cemented structure a low fraction of biomass and various high levels of inhibitory pollutants xu et al 2020a 2021d 2020c this difference may lead to the high importance of substrate types in this dataset meanwhile the concentration of substrate will directly affect the potential of methane production and therefore it presented high importance the diameter of microplastic is a key index that is mentioned in almost all literature about microplastics in the anaerobic digestion dataset only the initial diameter of added microplastic was recorded table 1 however microplastics may be deteriorated in the anaerobic digestion processes especially in the pretreatment processes for was e g hydrogen peroxide naoh and hcl treatment hatinoglu and sanin 2021 li et al 2020b therefore the initial diameter of added microplastic in this dataset could not reflect the true size of microplastics exposed to the microbes moreover the distribution of microplastic size in was generated from wwtps is very complicated for example raju et al 2020 reported that larger sizes of microplastics were accumulated in the was compared to those in wastewater samples in contrast talvitie et al 2017 found that smaller microplastics were easier to be removed by adsorption on was during the sedimentation process therefore the detailed effects of microplastic size on methane require to be further explored in practical anaerobic digestion of was the concentration of microplastic is always the main variable discussed in anaerobic digestion literature whereas the lowest importance of it was observed in this study fig 4 b previous studies reported that low levels of microplastics may enhance methane production whereas higher levels of microplastics will restrain methane production and substrate hydrolysis by generating more ros which could induce cytotoxicity wei et al 2019b zhang and chen 2020 these results suggest that the microplastic concentration has great effects on methane production in their experiments this difference between its importance found in this study and common sense may be due to the low range of microplastic concentration added in collected literature table 1 leading to only a 4 92 27 3 decrease in methane production compared with control note that the difference in methane production between two close levels of microplastic concentrations was smaller in contrast the change in microplastic types resulted in a big difference in methane production table 1 therefore the importance of varying microplastic concentration was weaker than other input variables especially microplastic types and digestion time the shap summary was utilized to further evaluate the marginal effects of each variable on methane production the shap values of the 4 numeric variables i e digestion time microplastic diameter microplastic concentration and substrate concentration were obtained for the test dataset and varied within a certain range the shap value of each point determined its horizontal position and the color of each point represents the level of normalized variable value yang et al 2021 the different distribution of similar variable values in the horizontal position suggests that the effects of input variables are not only determined by their variable values but also affected by other variables yang et al 2021 as shown in fig 4 d the large distribution of digestion time in the shap summary plot proved its high importance meanwhile the low variable values of digestion time and substrate concentration are mainly distributed on the left side whereas the points with high variable values are mainly on the right side these results further demonstrated that longer digestion time and higher substrate concentration were conducive to methane production enough digestion time was required to produce methane from was due to the time consuming anaerobic digestion stages and rate limiting steps for was solubilization and hydrolysis luo et al 2018 xu et al 2021d the concentration of substrate added in the anaerobic digestion was the foundation of methane production whereas more substrates such as was may bring more toxic pollutants e g microplastics and ammonia into the anaerobic digestion systems xu et al 2021d therefore when digestion substrates are complexes such as was the true effects of substrate concentration on methane production are more complicated and required further investigation compared with the digestion time and substrate concentration the points of microplastic diameter and microplastic concentration presented a contrary trend confirming that higher microplastic diameter and microplastic concentration inhibited methane production zhang et al 2020 found that the inhibitory effects of nanoplastics on ad process were slightly more significant than that of microplastics which was inconsistent with our results they assumed that nanoplastics with smaller sizes are more likely to enter the cells leading to higher toxicity for microorganisms zhang et al 2020 however microplastics may deteriorate in the anaerobic digestion processes hatinoglu and sanin 2021 li et al 2020b and the initial microplastic diameter in this study could not reflect the true microplastic diameter which may explain the inconsistent results zhang et al 2020 besides the higher microplastic concentration may cause more toxic substances e g bisphenol a leaching from microplastics which decreased both methane potential and hydrolysis coefficient of was wei et al 2019a 2019b 3 4 the partial dependence plot analysis for variables related to methane production after identifying the important variables through variable importance and shap summary the dependence relationships between the most important input variables i e microplastic types digestion time substrate concentration and microplastic diameter and the methane production were visualized by the pdps friedman 2001 the pdps are drawn by changing the value of the variable of interest and holding other variables at a fixed value de clercq et al 2020 the light green envelopes in the pdps represent the range from partial dependence value minus standard deviation to partial dependence value plus standard deviation wang et al 2021 it was worth noting that when the data points were sparse the trend line might not be very informative or conclusive and should be ignored friedman 2001 for a single categorical variable like microplastic types in this study the pdp was represented by a bar plot fig 5 a where each bar represents one of its categories and the height of the bar represents the response value friedman 2001 among all microplastic types the addition of polystyrene showed the highest methane production which was consistent with the data collected from the literature table 1 for digestion time a clear increase of accumulated methane was achieved at the beginning period of anaerobic digestion whereas the slopes decreased gradually with the increase of digestion time moreover the end of methane production was observed after 30 days of anaerobic digestion wang et al 2021 according to these results the accumulation of methane was more effective in the first 10 days the pdp results showed a clear optimal operational adjustment for the digestion time of methane production similarly the increase of glucose concentration from 2000 to 5200 mg cod l also increased methane production while the further increase of substrate concentration by adding was did not enhance the methane production meanwhile a decrease in methane production was observed when the microplastic diameter increased from 0 07 to 40 μm the pdp results had a similar consistency to the shap summary and further revealed the dependence of methane production on microplastic and substrate variables the pdp illustrations from this dataset also provide potentially valuable insights into optimal operational adjustments such as digestion time microplastic and substrate characteristics zhu et al 2019 3 5 practical implications and limitations the effects of microplastics on methane production in anaerobic digestion processes have drawn increasing attention however the data related to microplastics and methane production are scattered in different literature this study collected these data from literature and selected mutual variables involved in the literature automl algorithms rather than manual deployment of machine learning were utilized to predict the methane production based on data related to digestion time microplastics and substrates all four types of automl algorithms i e tpot gama autogluon and h2o automl succeeded in learning internal nonlinear relationships among input and output variables and accurately predicted methane production after a certain period of training gbm based models e g catboost lightgbm xgboost embedded in the automl algorithm presented better prediction performance than common neural network models therefore the application of automl algorithms is effective in finding the optimized ml models without human intervention the advent of automl algorithms could immensely accelerate the establishment and deployment of ml models for real world usages related to environmental fields babaeian et al 2021 ferreira et al 2021 prasad et al 2021 the effects of microplastics on methane production were explored based on the well trained ml models using diverse explainable analyses microplastic types rather than microplastic diameter and concentration presented the highest importance in affecting methane production fig 4 the addition of polystyrene was associated with higher methane production fig 5 however different microplastic types were seldom discussed in a single study extensive work is needed to compare the true effects of microplastic types on anaerobic digestion and reveal the influence mechanisms involved on the other hand the increase in microplastic concentration caused a decrease in methane production which is consistent with the experimental results feng et al 2018 wei et al 2019a 2019b the dependence relationships discovered in this study may be served as a reference in engineering applications in terms of modeling the effects of microplastics in was and enhancing methane production in anaerobic digestion moreover the dependence of methane production on operating conditions could be revealed by the pdp analysis which helps to optimize operational adjustments in anaerobic digestion processes zhu et al 2019 this study also has several limitations although many other studies focused on the effects of microplastics on anaerobic digestion they cannot provide the data on the seven variables i e digestion time d microplastic types microplastic diameter μm microplastic concentration g l substrate types substrate concentration mg cod l and accumulated methane production ml selected to form automl dataset this condition limited the size of the dataset utilized in this study if more relevant data could be collected from experiments and literature more comprehensive results may be achieved in addition microplastics as organic matter go through dynamic biochemical processes in anaerobic digestion hatinoglu and sanin 2021 li et al 2020b therefore more effort should be put into the characterization of microplastics involved in anaerobic digestion in the current dataset only three kinds of microplastic variables i e microplastic types diameter and concentration could be extracted from the literature with the development of microscopic characterization tools more types of microplastic variables e g the concentration of key functional groups contact area or intake concentration involved in anaerobic digestion should be determined and discussed in the future by including these microplastic variables in the dataset a more comprehensive understanding of microplastics in anaerobic digestion could be derived 4 conclusions four automl algorithms were applied to predict methane production based on digestion time microplastic and substrate data collected from the literature the automl algorithms could automatically select the optimized ml models from the model library importance analysis revealed that microplastic types presented higher importance than the microplastic diameter and concentration the results of pdp presented that the existence of polystyrene was related to the highest methane production whereas the increase in microplastic diameter and concentration led to a decrease in methane production moreover the results of pdp could help find the optimal operational adjustments e g digestion time microplastic and substrate characteristics to improve methane production more types of microplastic variables should be characterized and added to the dataset to further explore the

15571,microplastics as emerging pollutants have been heavily accumulated in the waste activated sludge was during biological wastewater treatment which showed significantly diverse impacts on the subsequent anaerobic sludge digestion for methane production however a robust modeling approach for predicting and unveiling the complex effects of accumulated microplastics within was on methane production is still missing in this study four automated machine learning automl approach was applied to model the effects of microplastics on anaerobic digestion processes and integrated explainable analysis was explored to reveal the relationships between key variables e g concentration type and size of microplastics and methane production the results showed that the gradient boosting machine had better prediction performance mean squared error mse 17 0 than common neural networks models mse 58 0 demonstrating that the automl algorithms succeeded in predicting the methane production and could select the best machine learning model without human intervention explainable analysis results indicated that the variable of microplastic types was more important than the variable of microplastic diameter and concentration the existence of polystyrene was associated with higher methane production whereas increasing microplastic diameter and concentration both inhibited methane production this work also provided a novel modeling approach for comprehensively understanding the complex effects of microplastics on methane production which revealed the dependence relationships between methane production and key variables and may be served as a reference for optimizing operational adjustments in anaerobic digestion processes graphical abstract image graphical abstract

used is confidential 1 introduction the prevalence of microplastics in natural environments has become an emerging problem due to diverse anthropogenic activities such as agriculture aquaculture and tourism that discard microplastics during production and usage deng et al 2021 li et al 2020b wang et al 2020 the majority of these microplastics within domestic and industrial wastewater will enter the wastewater treatment systems more than 90 of microplastics have been found to be accumulated in waste activated sludge was which can serve as digestion substrates for anaerobic digestion hatinoglu and sanin 2021 the existence of microplastics may affect the production rate of methane in anaerobic digestion because they had a great influence on the activity of the anaerobe such as hydrolysis acidification and methanogenesis activities feng et al 2018 wei et al 2019a moreover during anaerobic digestion processes the deterioration of microplastics may occur which will reduce the size of microplastics to a nanometer level hatinoglu and sanin 2021 these nanoplastics will infiltrate into the microbial cells and produce reactive oxygen species ros bringing inhibitory effects on the activity of microbial communities zhang and chen 2020 therefore the effects of microplastics on anaerobic digestion processes highly depend on their concentration physicochemical properties and contact time hatinoglu and sanin 2021 li et al 2020a wei et al 2019b machine learning ml models provide the capacity to solve nonlinear classification and regression tasks by extracting internal information and learning patterns from big data huang et al 2021 xu et al 2021a 2020b for microplastics in environments several ml models have been developed to classify or identify microplastics cowger et al 2020 post et al 2021 yurtsever and yurtsever 2019 for example the combination of the deep uv raman spectrometer and convolutional neural networks could detect the most widespread microplastics in aquatic systems post et al 2021 ml models also could automatically count and classify microplastic particles from pictures lorenzo navarro et al 2021 however current ml models were all established based on the image like data of microplastics the increasing data availability in the literature related to anaerobic digestion with different microplastics could help the establishment of ml models for modeling the complex effects of microplastics on anaerobic digestion processes relating to their concentration and physicochemical properties chen et al 2021 wei et al 2019a 2019b in the traditional development of ml models experts heavily participate in the entire design procedure of ml models i e feature engineering model selection algorithm selection hyperparameter tuning etc which are time consuming and cannot be easily redesigned by non experts abd elrahman et al 2020 ferreira et al 2021 to this end several automated machine learning automl frameworks such as auto sklearn feurer et al 2020 2015 tree based pipeline optimization tool tpot le et al 2020 olson et al 2016 genetic automated machine learning assistant gama gijsbers and vanschoren 2019 autogluon erickson et al 2020 and h2o automl ledell 2020 has been proposed to take the human out of these ml applications by automatically comparing and deploying high performance ml models these automl frameworks have been successfully applied in other fields including crash severity prediction angarita zapata et al 2021 devices classification seo et al 2021 and epidemiology prediction liu et al 2022 nevertheless automl frameworks have not been tested in modeling the effects of microplastics on anaerobic digestion processes by using automl frameworks the relationships among variables related to methane production in anaerobic digestion processes may be promising to be discovered and the accurate prediction of methane production could be achieved without frequent manual intervention therefore this study aims to model the effects of microplastics on anaerobic digestion processes through diverse automl algorithms and interpret these models via explainable analysis to reveal the relationships between key variables e g concentration type and size of microplastics and methane production the big data in the literature related to anaerobic digestion with different microplastics were collected and analyzed first then the performance of different automl algorithms in predicting methane production was compared the relationships among model variables were evaluated by explainable methods embedded in automl algorithms these results may improve the understanding of the effects of microplastics on methane production and help the enhancement of methane production through interaction mechanisms caused by microplastics moreover the advent of automl algorithms may immensely accelerate advancement in revealing the internal biochemical mechanisms through big data scattered in the literature 2 materials and methods 2 1 data extraction and analysis previous studies had reported that the existence of microplastics in digested substrates had a significant influence on methane production in anaerobic digestion processes wei et al 2019a 2019b zhang et al 2020 the accumulation of methane was also greatly affected by the characteristics of microplastics e g types concentrations and sizes in the anaerobic digestion reactors hatinoglu and sanin 2021 therefore a comprehensive literature search was carried out on the web of science to collect data about the methane production in anaerobic digestion processes exposed to different microplastics the search terms including microplastics or microplastic or nanoplastics or nanoplastic and methane or ch4 were used to search relevant literature the content of searched literature was examined and finally five studies were selected because they have consistent variables related to methane production table 1 from the five studies 871 methane production data points were mined to form a qualified dataset six input variables including digestion time d microplastic types microplastic diameter μm microplastic concentration g l substrate types and concentration mg cod l were chosen the dataset contained six different types of microplastic i e polystyrene polystyrene nh2 polystyrene so3h polyethylene polyvinyl chloride and polyester and two types of digested substrate i e glucose and waste activated sludge which were represented as categorical objects in the dataset the accumulated methane production ml during the anaerobic digestion processes was selected as the output variable the values of numerical objects such as digestion time d microplastic diameter μm microplastic concentration g l substrate concentration mg cod l and methane production ml were extracted manually using the digitizer function in the originpro 2022 originlab corporation northampton usa the values of all numerical objects were transformed into unified units table 1 respectively the relationships among input and output variables in the dataset were first illustrated by exploratory data analysis eda which can visualize the entire distribution of pairwise variables along the timeline moreover the pearson product moment correlation coefficient ppmc was calculated to further evaluate the correlations among variables in the collected dataset based on the following equation bennett et al 2013 1 r i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 where x i y i is the evaluated data pair and x and y are mean values of the variables ppmc calculates the linear correlation between two series of data and lies between 1 and 1 a ppmc value close to 1 indicates a high correlation between two variables bennett et al 2013 xu et al 2021c 2 2 implementation of automl four types of famous automl methods including tpot le et al 2020 olson et al 2016 gama gijsbers and vanschoren 2019 autogluon erickson et al 2020 and h2o automl ledell 2020 were selected to simulate the complex effects of accumulated microplastics within was on methane production because these four automl methods performed well on regression tasks in many fields angarita zapata et al 2021 ferreira et al 2020 2021 these automl methods can automatically select ml models and stack ensembles based on different algorithms and training strategies and can help design the optimized ml models in a limited amount of time ferreira et al 2021 2 2 1 tpot the tpot utilizes genetic programming to automatically design and optimize ml pipelines and then provides the python code for the best ml pipeline fig s1 three types of preprocessors i e standard scaler robust scaler and polynomial features can be implemented to preprocess tabular data several supervised learning models including individual and ensemble tree based models non probabilistic and probabilistic linear models and k nearest neighbors are optional in the tpot the tabular dataset will successively flow through these pipeline operators that will add remove or modify the features in the dataset then the final predictions are utilized to evaluate the overall accuracy of the ml pipelines fig s2 the detailed implementation of the tpot can be found at https github com epistasislab tpot 2 2 2 gama similar to tpot gama also utilizes genetic programming to generate optimized ml pipelines with qualified datasets and limited computational time the pipeline of gama is consistent with the pipeline of tpot consisting of data preprocessing ml algorithm selection and hyperparameter fine tuning the major difference between tpot and gama lies in the different evolutionary algorithms tpot utilizes a synchronous evolutionary algorithm whereas gama uses an asynchronous algorithm which can make use of computing resources better moreover gama focuses more on extensibility and research friendliness by using different search strategies ensembling post processing steps and visualizing the optimization process some famous ml algorithms e g random forest support vector machine and gaussian naive bayes and their ensembles are considered in the gama more information about the gama can be found at https openml labs github io gama master index html 2 2 3 autogluon the autogluon an open source automl framework can automatically recognize the data type in each column and identify the modeling task i e binary multi class classification or regression based on data in the label column then the autogluon will randomly divide the dataset into various folds for model training vs validation individually fits various models i e neural networks lightgbm boosted trees catboost boosted trees random forests extremely randomized trees k nearest neighbors and finally creates an optimized model ensemble that outperforms any of the individual trained models the network architecture used by autogluon is illustrated in fig s3 a a multi layer stacking strategy is proposed in the autogluon fig s3 b the detailed description of the autogluon is available at https auto gluon ai stable index html 2 2 4 h2o automl the h2o automl provides a distributed ml learning platform with a single function for fully automated training candidate models and stacked ensembles in a short amount of time all candidate models will be listed on a leaderboard depending on diverse model performance metrics training time or average prediction speed the combination of fast random search and stacked ensembles is applied in the h2o automl to train various algorithms such as random forest xgboost gradient boosting machines gbm generalized linear models and deep neural networks the manual of h2o automl could be found at https h2o release s3 amazonaws com h2o rel zorn 2 docs website h2o docs welcome html 2 2 5 evaluation of the four automl algorithms in this study the raw dataset collected from the literature was randomly divided into 80 training dataset and 20 test dataset then these automl algorithms were conducted in a range of time 60 2400s and their regression performance was compared based on mathematical metrics such as mean squared error mse root mean squared error rmse and mean absolute error mae 2 mse 1 n i 1 n y i y i 2 3 rmse 1 n i 1 n y i y i 2 4 mae 1 n i 1 n y i y i where y i is the predicted value and y i is the true value all predictions were carried out five times and the best performance of these automl algorithms was recorded and compared 2 3 explainable analysis methods the results of the leader models generated by automl algorithms were interpreted by integrated explainable methods including residual analysis variable importance variable importance heatmap shapley additive explanations shap summary and partial dependence plots pdp these explainable methods were directly conducted in python code the implementation of these explainable methods is available at https h2o release s3 amazonaws com h2o rel zorn 2 docs website h2o docs explain html the residual analysis was utilized to plot the fitted values vs residuals on a test dataset mathematically the residual for a data point is the difference between the response value y and the predicted value ŷ the random distribution of residuals suggests that the ml model fits the data well whereas the systematic pattern of residuals implies that the ml model fits the data poorly cui et al 2020 the variable importance of each variable scaled between 0 and 100 can be calculated according to the relative influence of each variable on the tree based ml models whether that variable was selected to split on during the tree building process and how much the squared error over all trees improved decreased as a result ledell 2020 moreover the variable importance heatmap was used to present variable importance across multiple models which are ordered by their similarity shap summary plots can succinctly present the magnitude prevalence and direction of each variable related to the response value song et al 2020 the marginal effects of each variable on methane production were evaluated by the shap values then the dependence relationships of important variables on methane production were further examined by pdp friedman 2001 wang et al 2021 3 results and discussion 3 1 overview of the collected datasets the characteristics of all selected variables are shown in table 1 a wide range of digestion time 0 88 59 d in the collected dataset represented the entire digestion of digested substrates xu et al 2020c the microplastics with micro and nano size 0 07 1000 μm were both included in the collected dataset the size of microplastics affects the interactions between microplastics and microorganisms the larger microplastics can provide adsorption sites for microorganisms whereas the smaller microplastics may penetrate the microbial cells and cause cytotoxicity wei et al 2019b zhang and chen 2020 meanwhile a small range of microplastic concentration 0 0 33 g l was investigated in the literature indeed the concentrations of microplastic in was vary largely from 510 to 495 000 particle kg dry weight and highly depend on the types of wastewater hatinoglu and sanin 2021 to further reveal the general condition of collected datasets the numeric relationships between pairwise variables along the digestion time were analyzed by eda as shown in fig 1 a the accumulated methane production gradually improved with the increased digestion time much higher methane production was achieved under the polystyrene type 0 with small microplastic diameters 0 08 5 μm meanwhile methane production clearly decreased with the increasing concentration of microplastics which caused higher toxicity to both acidogens and methanogens wei et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 moreover the addition of glucose 2000 5200 mg cod l as digested substrate led to higher methane production than the addition of was 9040 10 480 mg cod l which may be due to the much higher bio assimilation rate of glucose than that of was the linear correlation between pairwise variables in the collected dataset was analyzed by ppmc as illustrated in fig 1 b the digestion time presented a weak positive correlation to methane production moreover microplastic types and substrate types were negatively correlated with methane production meanwhile methane production did not present a linear correlation with microplastic diameter microplastic concentration and substrate concentration therefore the internal relationships among these variables should be further discovered based on big data and nonlinear methods 3 2 methane production predicted by automl algorithms four types of famous automl algorithms i e tpot gama autogluon and h2o automl were applied to automatically generate optimized ml models for predicting methane production based on microplastic and substrate data a large range of training time i e 60 2400s was tested for each automl algorithm as shown in fig 2 a with the increase in training time tpot generated more model generations and compared their test performance as a result the test mse of the tpot gradually decreased from 31 3 to 11 3 indicating that the optimized model created by the tpot successfully learned the nonlinear relationships among variables the xgboost generated by the tpot achieved the best test performance mse 11 3 than other ml models e g random forest extremely randomized trees and k nearest neighbors generated by the tpot akin to the tpot the test mse of the gama also decreased from 40 9 to 12 8 with the increase in training time meanwhile the gama evaluated more ml models than the tpot within the same time due to their different evolutionary algorithms gijsbers and vanschoren 2019 the gama determined that the gbm was the best ml model with an mse of 12 8 for the collected dataset autogluon as an intelligent automl algorithm can infer the modeling task e g binary multiclass and regression based on the response data in the dataset and identify the type of each variable i e which columns contain continuous numbers vs discrete categories erickson et al 2020 therefore the implementation of autogluon requires minimal code and minimal pre processing for datasets all types of models trained by the autogluon are listed in table 2 with the increase in training time more types of models were generated and evaluated by the autogluon which will skip some models when there is not enough time left to train these models erickson et al 2020 as a result the validation and test mse of the ml models generated by autogluon both decreased to the same level that was similar to the performance of tpot and gama the catboost was the best ml algorithm with the mse of 17 0 chosen by the autogluon meanwhile the common neural network models were also tested by the autogluon i e neuralnetmxnet in table 2 comparatively gbm based models e g catboost lightgbm xgboost presented much better performance than the neural network models table 2 these results highlighted that the automl algorithm is conducive to finding the optimized ml models for a specific dataset angarita zapata et al 2021 seo et al 2021 for h2o automl the top 20 ml models with the highest prediction accuracy h2o automl consisted of gbm and stacked ensemble table s1 similar to the autogluon the h2o automl confirmed that the gbm was the most effective ml model for understanding the internal relationships between methane production and input variables fig 3 comparatively the h2o automl presented a quicker training speed than the autogluon fig 3 moreover the results of gbm could be interpreted by explainable methods embedded in the h2o automl ledell 2020 which are essential to revealing the true effects of microplastics on methane production ferreira et al 2020 overall all four automl algorithms successfully predicted methane production based on the collected microplastic dataset after a long period of training similarly ferreira et al 2020 utilized real world datasets to compare the performance of different automl algorithms they also found that all automl algorithms obtained high quality results and did not present substantial predictive differences these results indicated that there was indeed an internal relationship between methane production and these input variables i e digestion time microplastic types microplastic diameter microplastic concentration substrate types and concentration interestingly gbm based models e g catboost lightgbm xgboost rather than neural networks achieved better performance in predicting methane production the interpretability of gbm based models is also better than the neural networks with deep structures lundberg et al 2020 rudin 2019 the high quality prediction made by the gbm based models paves the way for correctly interpreting modeling results through explainable analysis 3 3 the importance analysis for variables related to methane production to achieve accurate prediction performance it is essential to interpret these model results to reveal the effects of microplastics on methane production to achieve this integrated explainable methods i e residual analysis variable importance variable importance heatmap shap summary and pdp plots were applied the performance of the optimized gbm was first analyzed by the residual analysis which displays the distribution of residuals on the test dataset a high frequency of residuals was found around zero especially for the lower methane production 0 160 ml fig 4 a indicating that the trained gbm has acquired sufficient predictive information cui et al 2020 liyanaarachchi et al 2021 the variable importance was then evaluated for each variable on the methane production which was found to follow the order of types of microplastic digestion time types of substrate concentration of substrate diameter of microplastic concentration of microplastic fig 4 b the variable importance across multiple models was also illustrated in the variable importance heatmap fig 4 c the importance of microplastic types was highlighted in all gbm models generated by the h2o automl at 2100s these results revealed that the types of microplastic presented the highest importance in affecting methane production on one hand the interactions between extracellular polymeric substances eps surrounding the microbial cells and microplastics rely on the features and textures of microplastics e g functional groups surface charges and hydrophobicity deng et al 2021 feng et al 2018 hatinoglu and sanin 2021 previous studies have found that microparticles with sulfate groups had greater sorption capacity onto microorganisms than that functionalized with amine or carboxyl groups feng et al 2018 peulen and wilkinson 2011 the cationic polystyrene nh2 caused more adverse effects on methane production than the anionic polystyrene so3h implying that different functional groups and surface charges of microplastics decided the penetration of microplastics in the eps matrix feng et al 2018 peulen and wilkinson 2011 on the other hand the biotoxicity of microplastics was found to be highly related to their leachates e g plastic additives wei et al 2019a zhang and chen 2020 plastic additives released from different microplastics may pose different effects on the microorganisms associated with methane production for example leachate caprolactam from polyamide 6 microplastics as one type of special plastic additive may affect methane production through binding onto relevant enzyme molecules chen et al 2021 the low level of caprolactam improved the affinity of enzymes with substrates and their catalytical activity whereas higher concentrations of caprolactam might occupy active sites of these enzymes and weaken the promoting effect of caprolactam chen et al 2021 however wei et al 2019a found that the nontoxic acetyl tri n butyl citrate additives leaching from polyethylene microplastics had a negligible effect on anaerobic digestion instead the inhibition of methane production was attributed to the ros induced by polyethylene microplastics wei et al 2019a therefore the effects of microplastics on microbial metabolisms and diversity highly depend on the features textures and plastic additives of microplastics however the effect of microplastic types was difficult to be compared directly among different literature hatinoglu and sanin 2021 the explainable analysis of big data collected from literature provided the capacity to overcome this issue the importance of digestion time on methane production is consistent with the widely accepted point that anaerobic digestion consists of four continuous stages i e hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis and thus enough digestion time is required to convert substrate to methane du et al 2021 liu et al 2021 xu et al 2021b interestingly the substrate types and concentrations showed higher importance than the microplastic diameter and concentrations glucose and was were two types of substrates used in all collected literature table 1 glucose is an easily absorbed substrate whereas the was has intrinsic drawbacks in anaerobic digestion such as cemented structure a low fraction of biomass and various high levels of inhibitory pollutants xu et al 2020a 2021d 2020c this difference may lead to the high importance of substrate types in this dataset meanwhile the concentration of substrate will directly affect the potential of methane production and therefore it presented high importance the diameter of microplastic is a key index that is mentioned in almost all literature about microplastics in the anaerobic digestion dataset only the initial diameter of added microplastic was recorded table 1 however microplastics may be deteriorated in the anaerobic digestion processes especially in the pretreatment processes for was e g hydrogen peroxide naoh and hcl treatment hatinoglu and sanin 2021 li et al 2020b therefore the initial diameter of added microplastic in this dataset could not reflect the true size of microplastics exposed to the microbes moreover the distribution of microplastic size in was generated from wwtps is very complicated for example raju et al 2020 reported that larger sizes of microplastics were accumulated in the was compared to those in wastewater samples in contrast talvitie et al 2017 found that smaller microplastics were easier to be removed by adsorption on was during the sedimentation process therefore the detailed effects of microplastic size on methane require to be further explored in practical anaerobic digestion of was the concentration of microplastic is always the main variable discussed in anaerobic digestion literature whereas the lowest importance of it was observed in this study fig 4 b previous studies reported that low levels of microplastics may enhance methane production whereas higher levels of microplastics will restrain methane production and substrate hydrolysis by generating more ros which could induce cytotoxicity wei et al 2019b zhang and chen 2020 these results suggest that the microplastic concentration has great effects on methane production in their experiments this difference between its importance found in this study and common sense may be due to the low range of microplastic concentration added in collected literature table 1 leading to only a 4 92 27 3 decrease in methane production compared with control note that the difference in methane production between two close levels of microplastic concentrations was smaller in contrast the change in microplastic types resulted in a big difference in methane production table 1 therefore the importance of varying microplastic concentration was weaker than other input variables especially microplastic types and digestion time the shap summary was utilized to further evaluate the marginal effects of each variable on methane production the shap values of the 4 numeric variables i e digestion time microplastic diameter microplastic concentration and substrate concentration were obtained for the test dataset and varied within a certain range the shap value of each point determined its horizontal position and the color of each point represents the level of normalized variable value yang et al 2021 the different distribution of similar variable values in the horizontal position suggests that the effects of input variables are not only determined by their variable values but also affected by other variables yang et al 2021 as shown in fig 4 d the large distribution of digestion time in the shap summary plot proved its high importance meanwhile the low variable values of digestion time and substrate concentration are mainly distributed on the left side whereas the points with high variable values are mainly on the right side these results further demonstrated that longer digestion time and higher substrate concentration were conducive to methane production enough digestion time was required to produce methane from was due to the time consuming anaerobic digestion stages and rate limiting steps for was solubilization and hydrolysis luo et al 2018 xu et al 2021d the concentration of substrate added in the anaerobic digestion was the foundation of methane production whereas more substrates such as was may bring more toxic pollutants e g microplastics and ammonia into the anaerobic digestion systems xu et al 2021d therefore when digestion substrates are complexes such as was the true effects of substrate concentration on methane production are more complicated and required further investigation compared with the digestion time and substrate concentration the points of microplastic diameter and microplastic concentration presented a contrary trend confirming that higher microplastic diameter and microplastic concentration inhibited methane production zhang et al 2020 found that the inhibitory effects of nanoplastics on ad process were slightly more significant than that of microplastics which was inconsistent with our results they assumed that nanoplastics with smaller sizes are more likely to enter the cells leading to higher toxicity for microorganisms zhang et al 2020 however microplastics may deteriorate in the anaerobic digestion processes hatinoglu and sanin 2021 li et al 2020b and the initial microplastic diameter in this study could not reflect the true microplastic diameter which may explain the inconsistent results zhang et al 2020 besides the higher microplastic concentration may cause more toxic substances e g bisphenol a leaching from microplastics which decreased both methane potential and hydrolysis coefficient of was wei et al 2019a 2019b 3 4 the partial dependence plot analysis for variables related to methane production after identifying the important variables through variable importance and shap summary the dependence relationships between the most important input variables i e microplastic types digestion time substrate concentration and microplastic diameter and the methane production were visualized by the pdps friedman 2001 the pdps are drawn by changing the value of the variable of interest and holding other variables at a fixed value de clercq et al 2020 the light green envelopes in the pdps represent the range from partial dependence value minus standard deviation to partial dependence value plus standard deviation wang et al 2021 it was worth noting that when the data points were sparse the trend line might not be very informative or conclusive and should be ignored friedman 2001 for a single categorical variable like microplastic types in this study the pdp was represented by a bar plot fig 5 a where each bar represents one of its categories and the height of the bar represents the response value friedman 2001 among all microplastic types the addition of polystyrene showed the highest methane production which was consistent with the data collected from the literature table 1 for digestion time a clear increase of accumulated methane was achieved at the beginning period of anaerobic digestion whereas the slopes decreased gradually with the increase of digestion time moreover the end of methane production was observed after 30 days of anaerobic digestion wang et al 2021 according to these results the accumulation of methane was more effective in the first 10 days the pdp results showed a clear optimal operational adjustment for the digestion time of methane production similarly the increase of glucose concentration from 2000 to 5200 mg cod l also increased methane production while the further increase of substrate concentration by adding was did not enhance the methane production meanwhile a decrease in methane production was observed when the microplastic diameter increased from 0 07 to 40 μm the pdp results had a similar consistency to the shap summary and further revealed the dependence of methane production on microplastic and substrate variables the pdp illustrations from this dataset also provide potentially valuable insights into optimal operational adjustments such as digestion time microplastic and substrate characteristics zhu et al 2019 3 5 practical implications and limitations the effects of microplastics on methane production in anaerobic digestion processes have drawn increasing attention however the data related to microplastics and methane production are scattered in different literature this study collected these data from literature and selected mutual variables involved in the literature automl algorithms rather than manual deployment of machine learning were utilized to predict the methane production based on data related to digestion time microplastics and substrates all four types of automl algorithms i e tpot gama autogluon and h2o automl succeeded in learning internal nonlinear relationships among input and output variables and accurately predicted methane production after a certain period of training gbm based models e g catboost lightgbm xgboost embedded in the automl algorithm presented better prediction performance than common neural network models therefore the application of automl algorithms is effective in finding the optimized ml models without human intervention the advent of automl algorithms could immensely accelerate the establishment and deployment of ml models for real world usages related to environmental fields babaeian et al 2021 ferreira et al 2021 prasad et al 2021 the effects of microplastics on methane production were explored based on the well trained ml models using diverse explainable analyses microplastic types rather than microplastic diameter and concentration presented the highest importance in affecting methane production fig 4 the addition of polystyrene was associated with higher methane production fig 5 however different microplastic types were seldom discussed in a single study extensive work is needed to compare the true effects of microplastic types on anaerobic digestion and reveal the influence mechanisms involved on the other hand the increase in microplastic concentration caused a decrease in methane production which is consistent with the experimental results feng et al 2018 wei et al 2019a 2019b the dependence relationships discovered in this study may be served as a reference in engineering applications in terms of modeling the effects of microplastics in was and enhancing methane production in anaerobic digestion moreover the dependence of methane production on operating conditions could be revealed by the pdp analysis which helps to optimize operational adjustments in anaerobic digestion processes zhu et al 2019 this study also has several limitations although many other studies focused on the effects of microplastics on anaerobic digestion they cannot provide the data on the seven variables i e digestion time d microplastic types microplastic diameter μm microplastic concentration g l substrate types substrate concentration mg cod l and accumulated methane production ml selected to form automl dataset this condition limited the size of the dataset utilized in this study if more relevant data could be collected from experiments and literature more comprehensive results may be achieved in addition microplastics as organic matter go through dynamic biochemical processes in anaerobic digestion hatinoglu and sanin 2021 li et al 2020b therefore more effort should be put into the characterization of microplastics involved in anaerobic digestion in the current dataset only three kinds of microplastic variables i e microplastic types diameter and concentration could be extracted from the literature with the development of microscopic characterization tools more types of microplastic variables e g the concentration of key functional groups contact area or intake concentration involved in anaerobic digestion should be determined and discussed in the future by including these microplastic variables in the dataset a more comprehensive understanding of microplastics in anaerobic digestion could be derived 4 conclusions four automl algorithms were applied to predict methane production based on digestion time microplastic and substrate data collected from the literature the automl algorithms could automatically select the optimized ml models from the model library importance analysis revealed that microplastic types presented higher importance than the microplastic diameter and concentration the results of pdp presented that the existence of polystyrene was related to the highest methane production whereas the increase in microplastic diameter and concentration led to a decrease in methane production moreover the results of pdp could help find the optimal operational adjustments e g digestion time microplastic and substrate characteristics to improve methane production more types of microplastic variables should be characterized and added to the dataset to further explore the

15572,existing studies on the virtual scarce water flows within the water energy context focus on water quantity while largely ignoring water quality this study improves the quantification method of scarce water uses by considering both blue water representing water quantity and grey water indicating water quality based on a scarce water extended multi regional input output model we investigate the virtual scarce water flows driven by energy demand across 31 chinese regions in 2012 and 2017 the results show that considering water quality provides new insights into the patterns of interregional flows of virtual scarce water driven by energy demand the virtual integrated scarce water visw flows which consider both water quantity and quality are 5 times the volume of virtual quantity based scarce water vqsw flows moreover certain regions e g hebei are recognized as net visw exporters but are net importers in terms of vqsw there are significant differences in the critical interregional pairs identified based on net visw flows e g shandong zhejiang and shandong guangdong and net vqsw flows e g heilongjiang guangdong and liaoning shaanxi to reduce water scarcity based on the combined effect of both quantity and quality the critical visw interregional pairs should enhance cooperation through compensation payments and interregional technology transfer this study highlights the importance of water quality in the assessment of virtual scarce water uses employing virtual scarce water as a policy tool to mitigate water scarcity might fail without the

1 introduction water is an indispensable resource for human beings ye et al 2018 with rapid economic development and population expansion water scarcity has become pervasive around the world vanham et al 2018 particularly in china the per capita available water resource only accounts for 30 of the world average more seriously water quality deterioration intensifies the competition for clean accessible water the poor quality of water resources in 19 5 of lake areas in china deem it unfit for any purpose li et al 2021a water scarcity has become one of the most significant challenges threatening china s sustainable development energy production is an important contributor to water scarcity greater than 30 of water consumption and nearly 60 of water withdrawals of china s industrial production are related to energy extraction processing and power generation guan et al 2019 jia et al 2021 meanwhile the process of energy production generates thermal pollution and various aquatic pollutants leading to the degradation of local water quality raptis et al 2017 liao et al 2021 driven by the growing energy demand energy production will continue to expand and this will enhance the pressure on water resources davies et al 2013 water scarcity in turn can pose significant challenges to the security of energy supplies given the inextricable linkages between energy and water resources systematically examining the water energy nexus is crucial for reducing water scarcity ali and kumar 2017 almost every stage along the entire energy supply chain requires water input and discharges aquatic pollutants to natural water bodies zhang and anadon 2013 for example drilling and hydraulic fracturing in fuel extraction needs plentiful water and can pollute aquifers and thermal power plants require large amounts of cooling water and release organic pollutants lv et al 2020 the evaluation of water footprint which quantifies the amount of water required during the life cycle of energy production is vital in identifying the critical processes and improving resource efficiency gerbens leenes and hoekstra 2012 zhu et al 2020 the water footprint has three components blue green and grey the blue and green water footprints refer to the volume of blue water surface and ground water and green water rainwater particularly relevant for agricultural products respectively utilized throughout the full production cycle hogeboom 2020 based on natural background concentrations and applicable environmental thresholds the grey water footprint refers to the volume of water required to assimilate pollutants the advantage of the grey water footprint is that it evaluates water quality degradation via an indicator of freshwater equivalent rather than concentrations of specific pollutants martinez alcala et al 2018 the geographic disconnect between energy production and consumption complicates the design of policies to ensure energy and water security holland et al 2015 the water footprint associated with the energy production activities of a region are partly driven by the final energy demand of remote regions for example coal reserves are primarily distributed in northern and north western china whereas the primary energy consumers are in the developed southern and eastern coastal regions of the country lin et al 2019 the movement of energy resources enables blue and grey water uses embodied in commodity flows across territorial boundaries in the form of virtual water flows which may threaten water availability in exporting regions much work has been done to quantify the virtual blue water flows driven by energy demand through input output analysis liu et al 2021 meng et al 2022 they reveal the spatial interconnections of energy and water from the supply chain perspective and highlight the impacts of virtual blue water flows on water redistribution however the impacts of virtual grey water flows driven by energy demand on water pollution have not been well characterized the environmental impacts of water quality degradation can also be shifted from developed regions to developing regions through interregional trade creating water pollution spillover chini et al 2019 have constructed the virtual water network of the u s electricity grid they pointed out that the volume of virtual grey water flows was even much greater than the virtual blue water flows the analysis of virtual blue water flows or virtual grey water flows only emphasizes the volume of consumptive water or withdrawn water or polluted water with all flows being treated equivalently in fact the same volume of blue or grey water used in water abundant and water scarce regions would result in significantly different environmental impacts on local water resources feng et al 2014 thus regional water scarcity or water stress must be considered when analysing the water energy nexus there have been relatively few studies on virtual scarce water flows driven by energy demand as opposed to traditional virtual water flows zhang et al 2017 quantified the virtual scarce water flows through electricity transmission and argued that the consideration of regional water stress could change the structure of virtual water flows liao et al 2020 examined the scarce water uses in terms of energy demand in china s six megacities which considered not only direct scarce water used by energy sectors within territorial boundaries but also virtual scarce water imported from other regions to meet local energy demand i e indirect scarce water uses however these studies calculated virtual scarce water flows based on the blue water footprint and quantity based regional water stress the impacts of grey water footprint and quality induced regional water stress are not considered thus existing studies on virtual scarce water flows mainly focused on water quantity neglecting the fact that water quality degradation may impose a significant constraint on water availability although van vliet et al 2017 and liu et al 2016 have developed assessment approaches for regional water stress based on the concept of grey water footprint combining water quantity and quality they mainly considered local water management indirect effects that ripple through supply chains have not been addressed to the best of our knowledge no studies on virtual scarce water flows have employed the regional water stress indicator that combines water quantity and quality the objective of this study is to incorporate water quality into the assessments of virtual scarce water flows within the context of the water energy nexus first by comparing the grey water footprint against water withdrawals and water availability we propose an improved method for quantifying scarce water uses termed the integrated scarce water uses indicator we then combine the integrated scarce water uses for 48 sectors per region with a multi regional input output model to investigate the virtual scarce flows driven by energy demand in china in 2012 and 2017 integrated scarce water uses for both energy production and demand are also revealed this study for the first time provides a comprehensive analysis of the impacts of virtual scarce water flows driven by energy demand on water scarcity including the implications of water quality our findings provide detailed information for the formulation of energy related and region specific policies to reduce water scarcity in china 2 methodology and data 2 1 integrated scarce water uses in this study blue water uses refers to water withdrawals instead of water consumption using water consumption data would underestimate the water resources extracted by economic activities because there also exist non consumptive uses of water e g water used for cooling in energy production measuring water withdrawals is a good way to reflect the level of competition and dependence on water resources for a sector within a region direct quantity based scarce water uses can be measured by multiplying direct water withdrawals also known as the production based blue water footprint with the quantity based water stress index of the region liang et al 2021 1 d m i w s i q u a i w m i 2 w s i q u a i m 1 w m i q i where d m i denotes the direct quantity based scarce water uses of sector m in region i w s i q u a i is a dimensionless parameter reflecting the quantity based water stress index of region i w m i denotes the direct water withdrawals of sector m in region i and q i denotes the water availability in region i to quantify the impacts of economic activities on both water quality and water quantity we developed an integrated scarce water uses indicator based on the concept of the grey water footprint the direct integrated scarce water uses of sector m in region i d i m i can be calculated as follows 3 d i m i w s i i n t i w m i g m i 4 w s i i n t i m 1 w m i g m i g r i q i 5 g m i max σ τ l σ c σ m a x c σ n a t where w s i i n t i is the integrated water stress index of region i compared with w s i q u a i this additionally considers quality based water stress g m i denotes the direct grey water uses of sector m in region i also known as the production based grey water footprint g r i denotes the direct grey water uses of residents in region i indicating the amount of freshwater required to assimilate the sewage from residents and is calculated in a similar way as g m i l σ represents the load of pollutant σ discharged by sector m in region i c σ m a x is the maximum acceptable concentration of pollutant σ under class v this is the lowest water quality class below which water cannot be used for any purpose c σ n a t is the natural concentration of pollutant σ in the absence of human interference usually supposed to be zero and max σ τ denotes that when sector m in region i discharges various types of pollutants g m i is determined by the pollutant having the highest specific grey water footprint li et al 2021b 2 2 environmentally extended multi regional input output model the multi regional input output mrio model characterizes the intraregional and interregional flows of commodities within an economy at the sectoral level liang et al 2020 assume that there are p regions and q sectors per region p q region sectors in total in the mrio framework the row balance is given by 6 x a x y 7 x x 1 1 x m i x q p 8 a a 11 11 a 1 n 1 j a 1 q 1 p a m 1 i 1 a m n i j a q 1 p 1 a q n p j a m q i p a q q p p 9 y y 1 11 y 1 1 j y 1 1 p y m i 1 y m i j y m i p y q p 1 y q p j y q p p where x is the aggregated output vector in which element x m i denotes the output of sector m in region i a is the aggregated direct requirement coefficient matrix in which element a m n i j denotes the direct requirements of products from sector m in region i to produce per unitary total output of sector n in region j and y is the aggregated final demand vector in which element y m i j refers to the final demand of region j for the commodities produced by sector m in region i eq 6 can be transformed as follows 10 x i a 1 y l y where i is the identity matrix and l i a 1 is the leontief inverse matrix in which element l m n i j indicates both the direct and indirect requirements of products from sector m in region i to satisfy the unitary final demand of sector n in region j we can construct an environmentally extended mrio ee mrio model by treating the direct integrated scarce water uses of region sectors as the satellite account of the mrio table based on the ee mrio model the integrated scarce water uses induced by energy related activities can be calculated as follows 9 i s w e p f i x e n 10 i s w e d f i i a 1 y e n 11 f i d i x 1 where the elements of the row vector iswep denote integrated scarce water uses for energy production the elements of the row vector iswed denote the integrated scarce water uses for energy demand which includes both direct and indirect integrated scarce water uses to meet the final energy demand the elements of the row vector x e n denote the total output of energy products the symbol denotes diagonalization the elements of the row vector fi denote the direct integrated scarce water uses caused by unitary total output termed direct scarce water intensity in this study the elements of the vector f i i a 1 denote the virtual integrated scarce water visw intensity reflecting the total integrated scarce water uses for one unit of the final consumption of each region sector the elements of the column vector y e n indicate the final demand of energy products and the elements of the row vector di are expressed as d i m i representing direct integrated scarce water uses similarly the quantity based scarce water uses induced by energy related activities can be calculated as 12 q s w e p f x e n 13 q s w e d f i a 1 y e n 14 f d x 1 where the elements of the row vectors qswep and qswed denote quantity based scarce water uses for energy production and demand respectively the elements of the row vector f denote the direct quantity based scarce water intensity and the elements of the row vector d are expressed as d m i indicating direct quantity based scarce water uses although eq 10 examines the total integrated scarce water uses to satisfy the final energy demand it cannot distinguish between integrated scarce water uses for energy demand from local sources and visw imports to quantify the import of visw from region i to region j eq 10 can be modified as 15 v i s w i j f i i i a 1 y e n j where v i s w i j represents the transfer of visw from region i to region j to satisfy the final energy demand of region j the vector f i i denotes the direct integrated scarce water intensity for region i and the vector y e n j indicates the final energy demand of region j using the same method we can quantify the virtual quantity based scarce water vqsw flows driven by energy demand 2 3 data sources four types of data are required in this study the chinese mrio tables water withdrawals for each region sector water availability for each region and aquatic pollutant emissions for each region sector in 2012 and 2017 this study takes the year 2017 as the baseline the latest year for which all the required data are available the chinese mrio tables for 2012 and 2017 are compiled by zheng et al 2020 these original mrio tables list 31 regions hong kong macao and taiwan are not included and 42 economic sectors per region to extract more detailed information about the impacts of energy related activities on water resources the production and supply of electricity and heat power sector in the original mrio tables is further disaggregated into seven subsectors we conduct sectoral disaggregation by setting up concordance matrices and proxy variable vectors wang et al 2017 see section s1 in the supporting information for details as a result the new mrio tables include 48 sectors per region 11 of which are energy sectors data for the water withdrawals of each region sector in 2012 are from sectoral sampling statistics of the ministry of ecology and environment of china cai et al 2018 to obtain the water withdrawals of subsectors of production and supply of electricity and heat power we estimate the relevant data based on the subsectors water consumption norms data for the water withdrawals of region sectors in 2017 are unavailable first we assume that each region sector s water withdrawal intensity is consistent with that in 2012 then the water withdrawals of agriculture industry domestic life and ecology in each region in 2017 are introduced as constraints to balance the water withdrawals of region sectors consequently we get the final water withdrawals for 48 sectors per region the sum of which is equal to that of national statistics water availability for each region refers to the sum of surface water and groundwater water which are obtained from the china water resources bulletin 2012 and 2017 ministry of water resources the people s republic of china 2013 2018 the types of aquatic pollutants discharged by different economic activities exhibit variety we examine all indexes that can be obtained from environmental statistics due to the lack of data thermal pollution is not considered in this study table s1 shows the indexes for sectors and their data sources the emission data for agricultural sectors are only available for 2017 to obtain relevant data for 2012 we assume that the emission coefficients of agricultural sectors remain constant during 2012 2017 in addition the emission data for the subsectors of production and supply of electricity and heat power are aggregated as a total amount in the china statistical yearbooks we separate the emission data for each subsector based on the emission coefficients derived from the manual of accounting method and coefficient of generation and emission for industrial sources ministry of ecology and environment of china 2021 to match the sectoral resolution of the new mrio tables the aquatic pollutant emission data cover 48 sectors per region 3 results 3 1 integrated scarce water uses for energy production fig 1 a shows that the integrated scarce water uses for energy production iswep in china in 2017 is 106 billion m3 bm3 jiangsu 43 bm3 is the region with the largest iswep followed by shanghai 18 bm3 liaoning 4 7 bm3 hubei 3 6 bm3 and shandong 3 2bm3 these regions are responsible for 44 of the total national iswep potential reasons for the high iswep of these regions are as follows 1 their large scale energy production requires significant water withdrawals and grey water uses e g jiangsu liaoning 2 once through cooling technology prevails in their thermal power generation activities e g shanghai hubei resulting in higher direct integrated scarce water intensity than other regions that use air cooling and closed loop cooling technologies figs s1 and s2 and 3 they have relatively high wsi int values because of the limited available water resources e g shanghai shandong fig s3 when water quality is not included the value of quantity based scarce water uses for energy production qswep in china is 34 bm3 representing only 32 of the total national iswep moreover the ranking of regions by qswep is different from that based on iswep the top five regions in terms of qswep are jiangsu 16 bm3 shanghai 7 1 bm3 liaoning 1 1 bm3 hubei 0 9 bm3 and anhui 0 6bm3 although shandong has large iswep values it does not rank highly in terms of qswep shandong has relatively low water withdrawals for energy production but it uses large amounts of grey water and has high values of wsi int fig s1 resulting in large qswep values fig 1b shows the iswep and qswep values by sector iswep is dominated by the thermal power 71 of the national total petroleum refining 18 and coal 4 sectors conversely the iswep values for the wind power solar power and supply of electricity sectors are low together contributing to less than 1 of the national total the ranking of sectors in terms of qswep shows some consistency with the iswep results that is the sectors with the largest qswep are thermal power petroleum refining and coal these three sectors are not only responsible for significant water withdrawals but also use substantial amounts of grey water at the region sector level the largest iswep values come from the thermal power sector in jiangsu 40 bm3 petroleum refining sector in shanghai 11 bm3 followed by the thermal power sectors of shanghai 6 7 bm3 liaoning 3 2 bm3 and hubei 2 7 bm3 fig 1c note that some region sectors in the top 30 in terms of iswep are not in the top 30 when ranked by qswep table s3 for example the petroleum refining sector in ningxia ranks 23rd in the iswep results but is only 78th in the qswep results this region sector has relatively small water withdrawals however it uses substantial grey water and is located in ningxia which has the highest wsi int value resulting in large iswep 3 2 integrated scarce water uses for energy demand fig 2 a shows that the integrated scarce water use for energy demand iswed in china is 15 bm3 accounting for 14 of the total national iswep this is because the energy sectors are the intermediate stage of supply chains and most of their products are consumed in the production process with the rapid development of the social economy the trend toward post modernization will enhance the final demand of energy products regions with the largest iswed include provinces with a large share of heavy industry such as liaoning 1 1 bm3 and shandong 0 9 bm3 as well as rich coastal provinces such as jiangsu 2 8 bm3 shanghai 2 0 bm3 and guangdong 1 2 bm3 we also quantify the quantity based scarce water uses for energy demand qswed which does not consider water quality the total qswed in china is 3 8 bm3 representing only 26 of the total national iswed thus ignoring water quality leads to an underestimation of scarce water uses throughout entire supply chains that meet the final energy demand fig 2b shows the iswed and qswed by sector the sectors with the largest iswed are thermal power 31 of the national total petroleum refining 30 and supply of electricity 14 these sectors use large amounts of integrated scarce water to provide finished energy products for final consumers the sectoral distribution in terms of qswed is broadly consistent with the iswed results at the region sector level the largest iswed values come from the thermal power in jiangsu 1 8 bm3 petroleum refining in shanghai 1 0 bm3 thermal power in liaoning 0 6 bm3 and shanghai 0 6 bm3 and supply of electricity in jiangsu 0 5 bm3 fig 2c note that some critical region sectors with large iswed values are not identifiable in terms of qswed table s4 for example the petroleum refining sector in shandong ranks 19th in the iswed results but only 83rd in the qswed results the final consumption of energy products from the petroleum refining sector in shandong drives large amounts of upstream integrated scarce water uses but does not require equivalent upstream quantity based scarce water uses 3 3 interregional flows of visw driven by energy demand in 2017 interregional flows of visw driven by energy demand in china amount to 4 6 bm3 accounting for 31 of china s iswed the results for 27 provinces and four municipalities in china are agglomerated into eight geographical regions table s3 in general the south coast southwest beijing tianjin and central regions import large amounts of visw from north northeast northwest and central coast china to satisfy their final energy demands fig 3 a the major visw exporters are water scarce regions this flow pattern evidently has negative impacts on water sustainability at the national level the differences in visw flows between exporters and importers are defined as net visw flows in 2017 the top five net visw exporters are shandong 414 mm3 shanxi 319mm3 ningxia 213 mm3 jiangsu 204 bm3 and liaoning 187 mm3 fig 4 a the visw exports in these regions account for 17 19 10 2 and 7 of their iswep respectively these findings imply that the above regions use large amounts of integrated scarce water to meet the energy demands of consumers outside of the production region except for liaoning the primary net visw exporters face extreme water shortages with per capita water resources of less than 350 m3 the visw flows driven by energy demand further aggravate this water scarcity issue the most important net visw importer is guangdong 532 mm3 up to 52 of integrated scarce water uses for guangdong s energy demand comes from other regions similarly hunan 241 mm3 zhejiang 225 bm3 shaanxi 222 mm3 and yunnan 150 mm3 receive 54 65 89 and 85 respectively of their iswed from visw imports these net importing regions benefit from visw flows and are highly dependant on water resources in other regions to satisfy their final demand of energy products some regions with an almost identical level of water scarcity play different roles in the visw flows driven by energy demand for example beijing and shandong are water scarce regions the former is a net visw importer 72 mm3 while the latter is a net visw exporter 68 mm3 the patterns of visw flows driven by energy demand are mainly determined by the market conservation of water resources plays a limited role fossil fuels especially coal are distributed in the north and northwest regions consequently water scarce regions such as shandong and gansu act as net exporters of visw using their already scarce water resources to support other regions final energy demands policy makers should pay attention to the impacts of visw flows on local water scarcity and seek synergy between economic and environmental management moreover we find that when data on pollutants that can be obtained from statistics are all considered the direct grey water uses of energy sectors are determined by chemical oxygen demand cod that is for energy production cod is the critical index with the largest specific grey water footprint therefore efforts of the energy sectors in water scarce regions to reduce visw export should prioritize cod reduction in terms of sectoral distribution petroleum refining is the largest contributor to the overall visw flows approximately 35 1 6 bm3 of the total visw flows are driven by the final demands of petrochemical products fig 4a for example shandong zhejiang is the most important interregional pair with 63 million m3 mm3 of net visw flows of which 71 stems from the petroleum refining sector other major sectors that play significant roles in the visw flows include supply of electricity thermal power and gas which are together responsible for 53 of the total visw flows driven by energy demand all of these sectors are engaged in fossil fuel extraction and processing they have a larger visw intensity than sectors producing renewable energy such as the wind power and solar power sectors fig 5 china has promised to achieve carbon neutrality by 2060 and phase out the dependency of its economy on fossil by the end of the 12th five year plan period it is estimated that renewable energy will account for 11 of china s primary energy consumption china s energy transformation strategies may help reduce the visw flows driven by energy demand we also investigate the vqsw flows driven by energy demand in china when water quality is not considered the vqsw flows total 954 mm3 only 21 of the total visw flows fig 4b this indicates that water quality degradation significantly exacerbates the impacts of virtual scarce water flows driven by energy demand on water scarcity moreover the inclusion of water quality changes the virtual scarce water trade balances of several regions for example hebei has net exports of 68 mm3 visw but net imports of 24 mm3 vqsw transforming from a net visw exporter to a net vqsw importer this situation can be seen in tianjin it has net exports 45 mm3 of visw but net imports 0 4 mm3 of vqsw the inclusion of water quality changes the patterns of virtual scarce water flows for example the primary interregional pairs in terms of net visw flows include shandong zhejiang shanghai guangdong jiangsu guangdong shandong guangdong and shanxi guangdong however the major interregional pairs in terms of net vqsw flows are shanghai guangdong jiangsu guangdong heilongjiang guangdong ningxia guangdong and liaoning shaanxi fig 4b five of the top 10 interregional pairs in terms of net visw flows cannot be identified by the vqsw results the crucial roles of shandong and shanxi as virtual scarce water exporters are revealed by the visw results but are not reflected by the vqsw results 3 4 changes in interregional flows of visw driven by energy demand during 2012 2017 this study chooses the year 2017 as the baseline but also investigates the temporal evolvements in the visw flows driven by energy demand during 2012 2017 interregional flows of visw driven by energy demand in china in 2017 5 bm3 declined by 64 as compared to 2012 14 bm3 this variation is less related to the factor of water quantity as the water availability and direct water withdrawals remain relatively constant between 2012 and 2017 fig s4 the main driver of the change in visw is the reduction in the total national direct grey water uses which contributes to not only the mitigation of regional water stress induced by inadequate water quality but also the alleviation of water pollution embodied in exchanged commodities when water quality is not considered the vqws in 2012 is 1 1 bm3 representing only 8 of the total visw flows the ratio of vqws to visw in 2012 is much lower than that in 2017 seven of the top 10 interregional pairs in terms of net visw flows such as shandong shanghai and henan shanxi cannot be identified by the net vqsw flows fig 6 with the higher value of the total national direct grey water uses the impacts of water quality on virtual scarce water flows in 2012 are more pronounced than in 2017 fig s4 4 discussion 4 1 virtual scarce water flows versus traditional virtual water flows two frameworks can be applied to examine the impacts of virtual water flows on water resources one is the water footprint network which regards all virtual water flows as equally important the other is life cycle assessment which converts traditional virtual water flows into virtual scarce water flows by using regional water stress as a weight ji et al 2022 to reveal the differences between these two frameworks this study also maps the interregional virtual water blue grey flows driven by energy demand in china in 2017 based on the water footprint network section s2 in the supporting information while previous studies have investigated energy related virtual water flows they only focused on a single energy sector e g thermal power or treated the production and supply of electricity and heat power as a whole zhu et al 2020 lin et al 2019 our assessments of the interregional flows of virtual water and visw cover 11 energy sectors thus facilitating the availability of more detailed data for examining the water energy nexus we find substantial differences between virtual water results and visw results in terms of trade balance and flow patterns some developed but water scarce regions such as jiangsu and shanghai are significant net importers in terms of virtual water however in terms of virtual scarce water these regions are net exporters in contrast some water abundant southwest areas such as sichuan and guizhou are net importers based on virtual water results but net exporters based on visw results the major interregional pairs in terms of net virtual water flows include guangxi guangdong guangxi yunnan heilongjiang guangdong hubei guangdong and guizhou guangdong most flows identified by virtual water results occur between water abundant regions in contrast visw results reveal major flows conveying pressure on water resources from consumption centers to regions with water scarcity issues the traditional virtual water flows and visw flows have different emphases in the assessment and provide complementary insights into policies to mitigate water scarcity lenzen et al 2013 4 2 policy implications the close interrelations between energy and water make it crucial to develop energy related policies to reduce water scarcity however current policies launched by the chinese government always set distinct targets for energy and water conservation for example the 14th five year plan for power development establishes a national energy consumption target and the most stringent water management system emphasizes the red line for water use efficiency although previous studies have recognized that the entire energy supply chain is responsible for scarce water uses djehdian et al 2019 the implications of water quality are still overlooked this leads to an underestimation of the pressures of energy related activities on water resources and downplays the importance of certain energy sectors discharging large amounts of wastewater in reducing water scarcity this study integrates water quality into the framework of the water energy nexus which enables comprehensive insights into the formulation of energy related policies to reduce water scarcity the top three regions in terms of iswep in china in 2017 are jiangsu shanghai and liaoning at the region sector level region sectors with the largest iswep include the thermal power in jiangsu petroleum refining in shanghai and thermal power in shanghai regions and sectors identified by iswep accounting should take production side measures such as phasing out once through cooling systems and implementing end of pipe emissions control note that some of critical region sectors in terms of iswep e g petroleum refining sector in ningxia are not identified by qswep accounting this indicates limited space for reducing water scarcity by decreasing direct water withdrawals instead reductions in direct grey water uses should be prioritized potential measures include promoting wastewater recycling and establishing advanced wastewater discharge systems to reduce emissions of pollutants besides chemical pollutants some energy enterprises with once through cooling systems such as thermal power plants and petroleum refineries also cause thermal pollution and harm the local water ecosystem although the impacts of thermal pollution are not considered in the calculation of direct grey water uses due to a lack of data this issue still needs to be addressed it is recommended to set strict limits for thermal discharge which requires energy enterprises causing thermal pollution to meet temperature discharge standards to obtain permits in addition reducing investment in high polluting energy industries can help decrease direct grey water uses governments can shift investment from thermal power plants to renewable energy industries e g solar power to reduce the impacts on water quality while ensuring a balance between energy supply and demand this measure is consistent with china s green energy transition strategy to realize its long term goal of carbon neutrality china invested a cumulative 630 billion in clean energy between 2010 and 2017 for regions with large amounts of iswed such as jiangsu shanghai and guangdong consumption side measures would be effective in reducing water scarcity optimizing energy consumption behaviors would indirectly help to reduce upstream scarce water uses regional governments can guide local consumers to choose energy products with low iswed through subsidies and the imposition of taxes on energy products with high iswed in addition region sectors with large iswed e g thermal power in jiangsu petroleum refining in shanghai should focus on improving production efficiency in the use of upstream inputs taking the thermal power in jiangsu for example it uses large amounts of raw coal as fuel to provide energy products for final consumers therefore importing advanced technologies for the thermal power plants in shandong to enhance the utilization efficiency of coal is conducive to water scarcity mitigation when only focusing on water quantity some region sectors e g petroleum refining in shandong cannot be identified by qswed accounting with the increasing final demand of energy products consumers should not only be more aware of the need for water saving but also focus on threats to water quality moreover our results show that many developed provinces such as zhejiang guangdong and shanghai are net energy related visw importers at the cost of water resource depletion in water scarce provinces such as shandong shanxi and ningxia to mitigate the pressure on their water resources these less developed and water scarce regions should limit visw exports by reducing the export of energy products with high visw intensity such as the products from petroleum refining the findings of this study also reveal the crucial origin destination linkages for net visw flows driven by energy demand this identifies explicit hotspots for interregional cooperation to reduce integrated scarce water uses at the national level destination regions should be concerned about water scarcity issues in the origin regions for example shandong zhejiang is the most critical interregional pair with 63 mm3 of net visw flows this means that water scarcity in shandong is partly driven by the final demand of energy products in shanghai it is necessary to strengthen the cooperation between these regions through compensation payments information sharing and interregional technology transfer these actions can help stimulate sustainable energy and water resource management in china 4 3 limitations uncertainties in the results of this study primarily stem from the uncertainties of the mrio data water withdrawal data and aquatic pollutant emission data first the inherent uncertainties of the mrio data mainly come from the complicated compilation procedures which include primary data collection and processing obtaining more detailed information on the uncertainties introduced by data processing would enhance the robustness of the results based on the mrio model second the sectoral aggregation of the mrio model may lead to limited information and some errors for example renewable energy products e g wind power and fossil energy products e g thermal power have significantly different direct integrated scarce water intensities however they are aggregated under the production and supply of electricity and power in the original mrio table this highly aggregated sector is disaggregated in our study this enables more detailed analysis at the level of specific energy products and reduces the uncertainties related to aggregation furthermore uncertainties in the water withdrawal data and aquatic pollutant emission data will have influenced the accuracy of our results however it is difficult to perform quantitative uncertainty analysis because of the lack of uncertainty information about the raw data improving the data quality of environmental databases in the future will help to reduce the uncertainties in the results of this study 5 conclusions in this study we integrated an improved scarce water uses quantification method with the mrio model to determine the virtual scarce water flows driven by energy demand in china this approach considers both water quantity and quality our results show that virtual scarce water flows driven by energy demand look significantly different when water quality is taken into account in 2017 the visw flows considering both water quantity and quality are 5 times the volume of vqsw flows this indicates that pollution intensifies the impacts of virtual scarce water flows driven by energy demand on water scarcity in addition the inclusion of water quality changes the patterns of interregional flows of virtual scarce water driven by energy demand for example hebei and tianjin are net visw exporters but net vqsw importers certain critical interregional pairs identified by net visw flows e g shanghai guangdong are not uncovered by examining the net vqsw flows our findings demonstrate the importance of water quality in assessing virtual scarce water flows policy formulation based solely on vqsw results may lead to inefficient water resources management overall the south coast southwest beijing tianjin and central regions import large amounts of visw as embodied in commodities from less developed northern regions to meet their final energy demand to reduce the potential impacts on water scarcity regions should reduce water withdrawals and grey water uses through technological innovation and the adjustment of energy demand structure in addition interregional cooperation such as compensation payments and technology transfer should be strengthened declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have

15572,existing studies on the virtual scarce water flows within the water energy context focus on water quantity while largely ignoring water quality this study improves the quantification method of scarce water uses by considering both blue water representing water quantity and grey water indicating water quality based on a scarce water extended multi regional input output model we investigate the virtual scarce water flows driven by energy demand across 31 chinese regions in 2012 and 2017 the results show that considering water quality provides new insights into the patterns of interregional flows of virtual scarce water driven by energy demand the virtual integrated scarce water visw flows which consider both water quantity and quality are 5 times the volume of virtual quantity based scarce water vqsw flows moreover certain regions e g hebei are recognized as net visw exporters but are net importers in terms of vqsw there are significant differences in the critical interregional pairs identified based on net visw flows e g shandong zhejiang and shandong guangdong and net vqsw flows e g heilongjiang guangdong and liaoning shaanxi to reduce water scarcity based on the combined effect of both quantity and quality the critical visw interregional pairs should enhance cooperation through compensation payments and interregional technology transfer this study

1 introduction water is an indispensable resource for human beings ye et al 2018 with rapid economic development and population expansion water scarcity has become pervasive around the world vanham et al 2018 particularly in china the per capita available water resource only accounts for 30 of the world average more seriously water quality deterioration intensifies the competition for clean accessible water the poor quality of water resources in 19 5 of lake areas in china deem it unfit for any purpose li et al 2021a water scarcity has become one of the most significant challenges threatening china s sustainable development energy production is an important contributor to water scarcity greater than 30 of water consumption and nearly 60 of water withdrawals of china s industrial production are related to energy extraction processing and power generation guan et al 2019 jia et al 2021 meanwhile the process of energy production generates thermal pollution and various aquatic pollutants leading to the degradation of local water quality raptis et al 2017 liao et al 2021 driven by the growing energy demand energy production will continue to expand and this will enhance the pressure on water resources davies et al 2013 water scarcity in turn can pose significant challenges to the security of energy supplies given the inextricable linkages between energy and water resources systematically examining the water energy nexus is crucial for reducing water scarcity ali and kumar 2017 almost every stage along the entire energy supply chain requires water input and discharges aquatic pollutants to natural water bodies zhang and anadon 2013 for example drilling and hydraulic fracturing in fuel extraction needs plentiful water and can pollute aquifers and thermal power plants require large amounts of cooling water and release organic pollutants lv et al 2020 the evaluation of water footprint which quantifies the amount of water required during the life cycle of energy production is vital in identifying the critical processes and improving resource efficiency gerbens leenes and hoekstra 2012 zhu et al 2020 the water footprint has three components blue green and grey the blue and green water footprints refer to the volume of blue water surface and ground water and green water rainwater particularly relevant for agricultural products respectively utilized throughout the full production cycle hogeboom 2020 based on natural background concentrations and applicable environmental thresholds the grey water footprint refers to the volume of water required to assimilate pollutants the advantage of the grey water footprint is that it evaluates water quality degradation via an indicator of freshwater equivalent rather than concentrations of specific pollutants martinez alcala et al 2018 the geographic disconnect between energy production and consumption complicates the design of policies to ensure energy and water security holland et al 2015 the water footprint associated with the energy production activities of a region are partly driven by the final energy demand of remote regions for example coal reserves are primarily distributed in northern and north western china whereas the primary energy consumers are in the developed southern and eastern coastal regions of the country lin et al 2019 the movement of energy resources enables blue and grey water uses embodied in commodity flows across territorial boundaries in the form of virtual water flows which may threaten water availability in exporting regions much work has been done to quantify the virtual blue water flows driven by energy demand through input output analysis liu et al 2021 meng et al 2022 they reveal the spatial interconnections of energy and water from the supply chain perspective and highlight the impacts of virtual blue water flows on water redistribution however the impacts of virtual grey water flows driven by energy demand on water pollution have not been well characterized the environmental impacts of water quality degradation can also be shifted from developed regions to developing regions through interregional trade creating water pollution spillover chini et al 2019 have constructed the virtual water network of the u s electricity grid they pointed out that the volume of virtual grey water flows was even much greater than the virtual blue water flows the analysis of virtual blue water flows or virtual grey water flows only emphasizes the volume of consumptive water or withdrawn water or polluted water with all flows being treated equivalently in fact the same volume of blue or grey water used in water abundant and water scarce regions would result in significantly different environmental impacts on local water resources feng et al 2014 thus regional water scarcity or water stress must be considered when analysing the water energy nexus there have been relatively few studies on virtual scarce water flows driven by energy demand as opposed to traditional virtual water flows zhang et al 2017 quantified the virtual scarce water flows through electricity transmission and argued that the consideration of regional water stress could change the structure of virtual water flows liao et al 2020 examined the scarce water uses in terms of energy demand in china s six megacities which considered not only direct scarce water used by energy sectors within territorial boundaries but also virtual scarce water imported from other regions to meet local energy demand i e indirect scarce water uses however these studies calculated virtual scarce water flows based on the blue water footprint and quantity based regional water stress the impacts of grey water footprint and quality induced regional water stress are not considered thus existing studies on virtual scarce water flows mainly focused on water quantity neglecting the fact that water quality degradation may impose a significant constraint on water availability although van vliet et al 2017 and liu et al 2016 have developed assessment approaches for regional water stress based on the concept of grey water footprint combining water quantity and quality they mainly considered local water management indirect effects that ripple through supply chains have not been addressed to the best of our knowledge no studies on virtual scarce water flows have employed the regional water stress indicator that combines water quantity and quality the objective of this study is to incorporate water quality into the assessments of virtual scarce water flows within the context of the water energy nexus first by comparing the grey water footprint against water withdrawals and water availability we propose an improved method for quantifying scarce water uses termed the integrated scarce water uses indicator we then combine the integrated scarce water uses for 48 sectors per region with a multi regional input output model to investigate the virtual scarce flows driven by energy demand in china in 2012 and 2017 integrated scarce water uses for both energy production and demand are also revealed this study for the first time provides a comprehensive analysis of the impacts of virtual scarce water flows driven by energy demand on water scarcity including the implications of water quality our findings provide detailed information for the formulation of energy related and region specific policies to reduce water scarcity in china 2 methodology and data 2 1 integrated scarce water uses in this study blue water uses refers to water withdrawals instead of water consumption using water consumption data would underestimate the water resources extracted by economic activities because there also exist non consumptive uses of water e g water used for cooling in energy production measuring water withdrawals is a good way to reflect the level of competition and dependence on water resources for a sector within a region direct quantity based scarce water uses can be measured by multiplying direct water withdrawals also known as the production based blue water footprint with the quantity based water stress index of the region liang et al 2021 1 d m i w s i q u a i w m i 2 w s i q u a i m 1 w m i q i where d m i denotes the direct quantity based scarce water uses of sector m in region i w s i q u a i is a dimensionless parameter reflecting the quantity based water stress index of region i w m i denotes the direct water withdrawals of sector m in region i and q i denotes the water availability in region i to quantify the impacts of economic activities on both water quality and water quantity we developed an integrated scarce water uses indicator based on the concept of the grey water footprint the direct integrated scarce water uses of sector m in region i d i m i can be calculated as follows 3 d i m i w s i i n t i w m i g m i 4 w s i i n t i m 1 w m i g m i g r i q i 5 g m i max σ τ l σ c σ m a x c σ n a t where w s i i n t i is the integrated water stress index of region i compared with w s i q u a i this additionally considers quality based water stress g m i denotes the direct grey water uses of sector m in region i also known as the production based grey water footprint g r i denotes the direct grey water uses of residents in region i indicating the amount of freshwater required to assimilate the sewage from residents and is calculated in a similar way as g m i l σ represents the load of pollutant σ discharged by sector m in region i c σ m a x is the maximum acceptable concentration of pollutant σ under class v this is the lowest water quality class below which water cannot be used for any purpose c σ n a t is the natural concentration of pollutant σ in the absence of human interference usually supposed to be zero and max σ τ denotes that when sector m in region i discharges various types of pollutants g m i is determined by the pollutant having the highest specific grey water footprint li et al 2021b 2 2 environmentally extended multi regional input output model the multi regional input output mrio model characterizes the intraregional and interregional flows of commodities within an economy at the sectoral level liang et al 2020 assume that there are p regions and q sectors per region p q region sectors in total in the mrio framework the row balance is given by 6 x a x y 7 x x 1 1 x m i x q p 8 a a 11 11 a 1 n 1 j a 1 q 1 p a m 1 i 1 a m n i j a q 1 p 1 a q n p j a m q i p a q q p p 9 y y 1 11 y 1 1 j y 1 1 p y m i 1 y m i j y m i p y q p 1 y q p j y q p p where x is the aggregated output vector in which element x m i denotes the output of sector m in region i a is the aggregated direct requirement coefficient matrix in which element a m n i j denotes the direct requirements of products from sector m in region i to produce per unitary total output of sector n in region j and y is the aggregated final demand vector in which element y m i j refers to the final demand of region j for the commodities produced by sector m in region i eq 6 can be transformed as follows 10 x i a 1 y l y where i is the identity matrix and l i a 1 is the leontief inverse matrix in which element l m n i j indicates both the direct and indirect requirements of products from sector m in region i to satisfy the unitary final demand of sector n in region j we can construct an environmentally extended mrio ee mrio model by treating the direct integrated scarce water uses of region sectors as the satellite account of the mrio table based on the ee mrio model the integrated scarce water uses induced by energy related activities can be calculated as follows 9 i s w e p f i x e n 10 i s w e d f i i a 1 y e n 11 f i d i x 1 where the elements of the row vector iswep denote integrated scarce water uses for energy production the elements of the row vector iswed denote the integrated scarce water uses for energy demand which includes both direct and indirect integrated scarce water uses to meet the final energy demand the elements of the row vector x e n denote the total output of energy products the symbol denotes diagonalization the elements of the row vector fi denote the direct integrated scarce water uses caused by unitary total output termed direct scarce water intensity in this study the elements of the vector f i i a 1 denote the virtual integrated scarce water visw intensity reflecting the total integrated scarce water uses for one unit of the final consumption of each region sector the elements of the column vector y e n indicate the final demand of energy products and the elements of the row vector di are expressed as d i m i representing direct integrated scarce water uses similarly the quantity based scarce water uses induced by energy related activities can be calculated as 12 q s w e p f x e n 13 q s w e d f i a 1 y e n 14 f d x 1 where the elements of the row vectors qswep and qswed denote quantity based scarce water uses for energy production and demand respectively the elements of the row vector f denote the direct quantity based scarce water intensity and the elements of the row vector d are expressed as d m i indicating direct quantity based scarce water uses although eq 10 examines the total integrated scarce water uses to satisfy the final energy demand it cannot distinguish between integrated scarce water uses for energy demand from local sources and visw imports to quantify the import of visw from region i to region j eq 10 can be modified as 15 v i s w i j f i i i a 1 y e n j where v i s w i j represents the transfer of visw from region i to region j to satisfy the final energy demand of region j the vector f i i denotes the direct integrated scarce water intensity for region i and the vector y e n j indicates the final energy demand of region j using the same method we can quantify the virtual quantity based scarce water vqsw flows driven by energy demand 2 3 data sources four types of data are required in this study the chinese mrio tables water withdrawals for each region sector water availability for each region and aquatic pollutant emissions for each region sector in 2012 and 2017 this study takes the year 2017 as the baseline the latest year for which all the required data are available the chinese mrio tables for 2012 and 2017 are compiled by zheng et al 2020 these original mrio tables list 31 regions hong kong macao and taiwan are not included and 42 economic sectors per region to extract more detailed information about the impacts of energy related activities on water resources the production and supply of electricity and heat power sector in the original mrio tables is further disaggregated into seven subsectors we conduct sectoral disaggregation by setting up concordance matrices and proxy variable vectors wang et al 2017 see section s1 in the supporting information for details as a result the new mrio tables include 48 sectors per region 11 of which are energy sectors data for the water withdrawals of each region sector in 2012 are from sectoral sampling statistics of the ministry of ecology and environment of china cai et al 2018 to obtain the water withdrawals of subsectors of production and supply of electricity and heat power we estimate the relevant data based on the subsectors water consumption norms data for the water withdrawals of region sectors in 2017 are unavailable first we assume that each region sector s water withdrawal intensity is consistent with that in 2012 then the water withdrawals of agriculture industry domestic life and ecology in each region in 2017 are introduced as constraints to balance the water withdrawals of region sectors consequently we get the final water withdrawals for 48 sectors per region the sum of which is equal to that of national statistics water availability for each region refers to the sum of surface water and groundwater water which are obtained from the china water resources bulletin 2012 and 2017 ministry of water resources the people s republic of china 2013 2018 the types of aquatic pollutants discharged by different economic activities exhibit variety we examine all indexes that can be obtained from environmental statistics due to the lack of data thermal pollution is not considered in this study table s1 shows the indexes for sectors and their data sources the emission data for agricultural sectors are only available for 2017 to obtain relevant data for 2012 we assume that the emission coefficients of agricultural sectors remain constant during 2012 2017 in addition the emission data for the subsectors of production and supply of electricity and heat power are aggregated as a total amount in the china statistical yearbooks we separate the emission data for each subsector based on the emission coefficients derived from the manual of accounting method and coefficient of generation and emission for industrial sources ministry of ecology and environment of china 2021 to match the sectoral resolution of the new mrio tables the aquatic pollutant emission data cover 48 sectors per region 3 results 3 1 integrated scarce water uses for energy production fig 1 a shows that the integrated scarce water uses for energy production iswep in china in 2017 is 106 billion m3 bm3 jiangsu 43 bm3 is the region with the largest iswep followed by shanghai 18 bm3 liaoning 4 7 bm3 hubei 3 6 bm3 and shandong 3 2bm3 these regions are responsible for 44 of the total national iswep potential reasons for the high iswep of these regions are as follows 1 their large scale energy production requires significant water withdrawals and grey water uses e g jiangsu liaoning 2 once through cooling technology prevails in their thermal power generation activities e g shanghai hubei resulting in higher direct integrated scarce water intensity than other regions that use air cooling and closed loop cooling technologies figs s1 and s2 and 3 they have relatively high wsi int values because of the limited available water resources e g shanghai shandong fig s3 when water quality is not included the value of quantity based scarce water uses for energy production qswep in china is 34 bm3 representing only 32 of the total national iswep moreover the ranking of regions by qswep is different from that based on iswep the top five regions in terms of qswep are jiangsu 16 bm3 shanghai 7 1 bm3 liaoning 1 1 bm3 hubei 0 9 bm3 and anhui 0 6bm3 although shandong has large iswep values it does not rank highly in terms of qswep shandong has relatively low water withdrawals for energy production but it uses large amounts of grey water and has high values of wsi int fig s1 resulting in large qswep values fig 1b shows the iswep and qswep values by sector iswep is dominated by the thermal power 71 of the national total petroleum refining 18 and coal 4 sectors conversely the iswep values for the wind power solar power and supply of electricity sectors are low together contributing to less than 1 of the national total the ranking of sectors in terms of qswep shows some consistency with the iswep results that is the sectors with the largest qswep are thermal power petroleum refining and coal these three sectors are not only responsible for significant water withdrawals but also use substantial amounts of grey water at the region sector level the largest iswep values come from the thermal power sector in jiangsu 40 bm3 petroleum refining sector in shanghai 11 bm3 followed by the thermal power sectors of shanghai 6 7 bm3 liaoning 3 2 bm3 and hubei 2 7 bm3 fig 1c note that some region sectors in the top 30 in terms of iswep are not in the top 30 when ranked by qswep table s3 for example the petroleum refining sector in ningxia ranks 23rd in the iswep results but is only 78th in the qswep results this region sector has relatively small water withdrawals however it uses substantial grey water and is located in ningxia which has the highest wsi int value resulting in large iswep 3 2 integrated scarce water uses for energy demand fig 2 a shows that the integrated scarce water use for energy demand iswed in china is 15 bm3 accounting for 14 of the total national iswep this is because the energy sectors are the intermediate stage of supply chains and most of their products are consumed in the production process with the rapid development of the social economy the trend toward post modernization will enhance the final demand of energy products regions with the largest iswed include provinces with a large share of heavy industry such as liaoning 1 1 bm3 and shandong 0 9 bm3 as well as rich coastal provinces such as jiangsu 2 8 bm3 shanghai 2 0 bm3 and guangdong 1 2 bm3 we also quantify the quantity based scarce water uses for energy demand qswed which does not consider water quality the total qswed in china is 3 8 bm3 representing only 26 of the total national iswed thus ignoring water quality leads to an underestimation of scarce water uses throughout entire supply chains that meet the final energy demand fig 2b shows the iswed and qswed by sector the sectors with the largest iswed are thermal power 31 of the national total petroleum refining 30 and supply of electricity 14 these sectors use large amounts of integrated scarce water to provide finished energy products for final consumers the sectoral distribution in terms of qswed is broadly consistent with the iswed results at the region sector level the largest iswed values come from the thermal power in jiangsu 1 8 bm3 petroleum refining in shanghai 1 0 bm3 thermal power in liaoning 0 6 bm3 and shanghai 0 6 bm3 and supply of electricity in jiangsu 0 5 bm3 fig 2c note that some critical region sectors with large iswed values are not identifiable in terms of qswed table s4 for example the petroleum refining sector in shandong ranks 19th in the iswed results but only 83rd in the qswed results the final consumption of energy products from the petroleum refining sector in shandong drives large amounts of upstream integrated scarce water uses but does not require equivalent upstream quantity based scarce water uses 3 3 interregional flows of visw driven by energy demand in 2017 interregional flows of visw driven by energy demand in china amount to 4 6 bm3 accounting for 31 of china s iswed the results for 27 provinces and four municipalities in china are agglomerated into eight geographical regions table s3 in general the south coast southwest beijing tianjin and central regions import large amounts of visw from north northeast northwest and central coast china to satisfy their final energy demands fig 3 a the major visw exporters are water scarce regions this flow pattern evidently has negative impacts on water sustainability at the national level the differences in visw flows between exporters and importers are defined as net visw flows in 2017 the top five net visw exporters are shandong 414 mm3 shanxi 319mm3 ningxia 213 mm3 jiangsu 204 bm3 and liaoning 187 mm3 fig 4 a the visw exports in these regions account for 17 19 10 2 and 7 of their iswep respectively these findings imply that the above regions use large amounts of integrated scarce water to meet the energy demands of consumers outside of the production region except for liaoning the primary net visw exporters face extreme water shortages with per capita water resources of less than 350 m3 the visw flows driven by energy demand further aggravate this water scarcity issue the most important net visw importer is guangdong 532 mm3 up to 52 of integrated scarce water uses for guangdong s energy demand comes from other regions similarly hunan 241 mm3 zhejiang 225 bm3 shaanxi 222 mm3 and yunnan 150 mm3 receive 54 65 89 and 85 respectively of their iswed from visw imports these net importing regions benefit from visw flows and are highly dependant on water resources in other regions to satisfy their final demand of energy products some regions with an almost identical level of water scarcity play different roles in the visw flows driven by energy demand for example beijing and shandong are water scarce regions the former is a net visw importer 72 mm3 while the latter is a net visw exporter 68 mm3 the patterns of visw flows driven by energy demand are mainly determined by the market conservation of water resources plays a limited role fossil fuels especially coal are distributed in the north and northwest regions consequently water scarce regions such as shandong and gansu act as net exporters of visw using their already scarce water resources to support other regions final energy demands policy makers should pay attention to the impacts of visw flows on local water scarcity and seek synergy between economic and environmental management moreover we find that when data on pollutants that can be obtained from statistics are all considered the direct grey water uses of energy sectors are determined by chemical oxygen demand cod that is for energy production cod is the critical index with the largest specific grey water footprint therefore efforts of the energy sectors in water scarce regions to reduce visw export should prioritize cod reduction in terms of sectoral distribution petroleum refining is the largest contributor to the overall visw flows approximately 35 1 6 bm3 of the total visw flows are driven by the final demands of petrochemical products fig 4a for example shandong zhejiang is the most important interregional pair with 63 million m3 mm3 of net visw flows of which 71 stems from the petroleum refining sector other major sectors that play significant roles in the visw flows include supply of electricity thermal power and gas which are together responsible for 53 of the total visw flows driven by energy demand all of these sectors are engaged in fossil fuel extraction and processing they have a larger visw intensity than sectors producing renewable energy such as the wind power and solar power sectors fig 5 china has promised to achieve carbon neutrality by 2060 and phase out the dependency of its economy on fossil by the end of the 12th five year plan period it is estimated that renewable energy will account for 11 of china s primary energy consumption china s energy transformation strategies may help reduce the visw flows driven by energy demand we also investigate the vqsw flows driven by energy demand in china when water quality is not considered the vqsw flows total 954 mm3 only 21 of the total visw flows fig 4b this indicates that water quality degradation significantly exacerbates the impacts of virtual scarce water flows driven by energy demand on water scarcity moreover the inclusion of water quality changes the virtual scarce water trade balances of several regions for example hebei has net exports of 68 mm3 visw but net imports of 24 mm3 vqsw transforming from a net visw exporter to a net vqsw importer this situation can be seen in tianjin it has net exports 45 mm3 of visw but net imports 0 4 mm3 of vqsw the inclusion of water quality changes the patterns of virtual scarce water flows for example the primary interregional pairs in terms of net visw flows include shandong zhejiang shanghai guangdong jiangsu guangdong shandong guangdong and shanxi guangdong however the major interregional pairs in terms of net vqsw flows are shanghai guangdong jiangsu guangdong heilongjiang guangdong ningxia guangdong and liaoning shaanxi fig 4b five of the top 10 interregional pairs in terms of net visw flows cannot be identified by the vqsw results the crucial roles of shandong and shanxi as virtual scarce water exporters are revealed by the visw results but are not reflected by the vqsw results 3 4 changes in interregional flows of visw driven by energy demand during 2012 2017 this study chooses the year 2017 as the baseline but also investigates the temporal evolvements in the visw flows driven by energy demand during 2012 2017 interregional flows of visw driven by energy demand in china in 2017 5 bm3 declined by 64 as compared to 2012 14 bm3 this variation is less related to the factor of water quantity as the water availability and direct water withdrawals remain relatively constant between 2012 and 2017 fig s4 the main driver of the change in visw is the reduction in the total national direct grey water uses which contributes to not only the mitigation of regional water stress induced by inadequate water quality but also the alleviation of water pollution embodied in exchanged commodities when water quality is not considered the vqws in 2012 is 1 1 bm3 representing only 8 of the total visw flows the ratio of vqws to visw in 2012 is much lower than that in 2017 seven of the top 10 interregional pairs in terms of net visw flows such as shandong shanghai and henan shanxi cannot be identified by the net vqsw flows fig 6 with the higher value of the total national direct grey water uses the impacts of water quality on virtual scarce water flows in 2012 are more pronounced than in 2017 fig s4 4 discussion 4 1 virtual scarce water flows versus traditional virtual water flows two frameworks can be applied to examine the impacts of virtual water flows on water resources one is the water footprint network which regards all virtual water flows as equally important the other is life cycle assessment which converts traditional virtual water flows into virtual scarce water flows by using regional water stress as a weight ji et al 2022 to reveal the differences between these two frameworks this study also maps the interregional virtual water blue grey flows driven by energy demand in china in 2017 based on the water footprint network section s2 in the supporting information while previous studies have investigated energy related virtual water flows they only focused on a single energy sector e g thermal power or treated the production and supply of electricity and heat power as a whole zhu et al 2020 lin et al 2019 our assessments of the interregional flows of virtual water and visw cover 11 energy sectors thus facilitating the availability of more detailed data for examining the water energy nexus we find substantial differences between virtual water results and visw results in terms of trade balance and flow patterns some developed but water scarce regions such as jiangsu and shanghai are significant net importers in terms of virtual water however in terms of virtual scarce water these regions are net exporters in contrast some water abundant southwest areas such as sichuan and guizhou are net importers based on virtual water results but net exporters based on visw results the major interregional pairs in terms of net virtual water flows include guangxi guangdong guangxi yunnan heilongjiang guangdong hubei guangdong and guizhou guangdong most flows identified by virtual water results occur between water abundant regions in contrast visw results reveal major flows conveying pressure on water resources from consumption centers to regions with water scarcity issues the traditional virtual water flows and visw flows have different emphases in the assessment and provide complementary insights into policies to mitigate water scarcity lenzen et al 2013 4 2 policy implications the close interrelations between energy and water make it crucial to develop energy related policies to reduce water scarcity however current policies launched by the chinese government always set distinct targets for energy and water conservation for example the 14th five year plan for power development establishes a national energy consumption target and the most stringent water management system emphasizes the red line for water use efficiency although previous studies have recognized that the entire energy supply chain is responsible for scarce water uses djehdian et al 2019 the implications of water quality are still overlooked this leads to an underestimation of the pressures of energy related activities on water resources and downplays the importance of certain energy sectors discharging large amounts of wastewater in reducing water scarcity this study integrates water quality into the framework of the water energy nexus which enables comprehensive insights into the formulation of energy related policies to reduce water scarcity the top three regions in terms of iswep in china in 2017 are jiangsu shanghai and liaoning at the region sector level region sectors with the largest iswep include the thermal power in jiangsu petroleum refining in shanghai and thermal power in shanghai regions and sectors identified by iswep accounting should take production side measures such as phasing out once through cooling systems and implementing end of pipe emissions control note that some of critical region sectors in terms of iswep e g petroleum refining sector in ningxia are not identified by qswep accounting this indicates limited space for reducing water scarcity by decreasing direct water withdrawals instead reductions in direct grey water uses should be prioritized potential measures include promoting wastewater recycling and establishing advanced wastewater discharge systems to reduce emissions of pollutants besides chemical pollutants some energy enterprises with once through cooling systems such as thermal power plants and petroleum refineries also cause thermal pollution and harm the local water ecosystem although the impacts of thermal pollution are not considered in the calculation of direct grey water uses due to a lack of data this issue still needs to be addressed it is recommended to set strict limits for thermal discharge which requires energy enterprises causing thermal pollution to meet temperature discharge standards to obtain permits in addition reducing investment in high polluting energy industries can help decrease direct grey water uses governments can shift investment from thermal power plants to renewable energy industries e g solar power to reduce the impacts on water quality while ensuring a balance between energy supply and demand this measure is consistent with china s green energy transition strategy to realize its long term goal of carbon neutrality china invested a cumulative 630 billion in clean energy between 2010 and 2017 for regions with large amounts of iswed such as jiangsu shanghai and guangdong consumption side measures would be effective in reducing water scarcity optimizing energy consumption behaviors would indirectly help to reduce upstream scarce water uses regional governments can guide local consumers to choose energy products with low iswed through subsidies and the imposition of taxes on energy products with high iswed in addition region sectors with large iswed e g thermal power in jiangsu petroleum refining in shanghai should focus on improving production efficiency in the use of upstream inputs taking the thermal power in jiangsu for example it uses large amounts of raw coal as fuel to provide energy products for final consumers therefore importing advanced technologies for the thermal power plants in shandong to enhance the utilization efficiency of coal is conducive to water scarcity mitigation when only focusing on water quantity some region sectors e g petroleum refining in shandong cannot be identified by qswed accounting with the increasing final demand of energy products consumers should not only be more aware of the need for water saving but also focus on threats to water quality moreover our results show that many developed provinces such as zhejiang guangdong and shanghai are net energy related visw importers at the cost of water resource depletion in water scarce provinces such as shandong shanxi and ningxia to mitigate the pressure on their water resources these less developed and water scarce regions should limit visw exports by reducing the export of energy products with high visw intensity such as the products from petroleum refining the findings of this study also reveal the crucial origin destination linkages for net visw flows driven by energy demand this identifies explicit hotspots for interregional cooperation to reduce integrated scarce water uses at the national level destination regions should be concerned about water scarcity issues in the origin regions for example shandong zhejiang is the most critical interregional pair with 63 mm3 of net visw flows this means that water scarcity in shandong is partly driven by the final demand of energy products in shanghai it is necessary to strengthen the cooperation between these regions through compensation payments information sharing and interregional technology transfer these actions can help stimulate sustainable energy and water resource management in china 4 3 limitations uncertainties in the results of this study primarily stem from the uncertainties of the mrio data water withdrawal data and aquatic pollutant emission data first the inherent uncertainties of the mrio data mainly come from the complicated compilation procedures which include primary data collection and processing obtaining more detailed information on the uncertainties introduced by data processing would enhance the robustness of the results based on the mrio model second the sectoral aggregation of the mrio model may lead to limited information and some errors for example renewable energy products e g wind power and fossil energy products e g thermal power have significantly different direct integrated scarce water intensities however they are aggregated under the production and supply of electricity and power in the original mrio table this highly aggregated sector is disaggregated in our study this enables more detailed analysis at the level of specific energy products and reduces the uncertainties related to aggregation furthermore uncertainties in the water withdrawal data and aquatic pollutant emission data will have influenced the accuracy of our results however it is difficult to perform quantitative uncertainty analysis because of the lack of uncertainty information about the raw data improving the data quality of environmental databases in the future will help to reduce the uncertainties in the results of this study 5 conclusions in this study we integrated an improved scarce water uses quantification method with the mrio model to determine the virtual scarce water flows driven by energy demand in china this approach considers both water quantity and quality our results show that virtual scarce water flows driven by energy demand look significantly different when water quality is taken into account in 2017 the visw flows considering both water quantity and quality are 5 times the volume of vqsw flows this indicates that pollution intensifies the impacts of virtual scarce water flows driven by energy demand on water scarcity in addition the inclusion of water quality changes the patterns of interregional flows of virtual scarce water driven by energy demand for example hebei and tianjin are net visw exporters but net vqsw importers certain critical interregional pairs identified by net visw flows e g shanghai guangdong are not uncovered by examining the net vqsw flows our findings demonstrate the importance of water quality in assessing virtual scarce water flows policy formulation based solely on vqsw results may lead to inefficient water resources management overall the south coast southwest beijing tianjin and central regions import large amounts of visw as embodied in commodities from less developed northern regions to meet their final energy demand to reduce the potential impacts on water scarcity regions should reduce water withdrawals and grey water uses through technological innovation and the adjustment of energy demand structure in addition interregional cooperation such as compensation payments and technology transfer should be strengthened declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have

15573,nanoplastics as emerging contaminants may be degraded from microplastics and released into aquatic systems globally which pose threats to human health via ingestion with food or water although plastic fragments have been isolated from placental tissues in pregnant women little is known about the direct toxicity of nanoplastics on human placental cells that plays a critical role in maintaining healthy growth of fetus this study explored the mechanistic toxicity of polystyrene nanoplastics ps nps with different sizes 25 50 100 and 500 nm and surface charges nh2 cooh and unlabeled on human placental cells results showed that ps nps had size and surface charge specific toxicity pattern the smaller the ps np size was the greater the toxicity induced on human placental cells in terms of surface charges nh2 labeled ps nps caused greater effects on cytotoxicity inhibition of protein kinase a pka activity oxidative stress and cell cycle arrest compared to cooh labeled and unmodified ps nps ps nps also induced size and surface charge dependent expression profiles of genes involved in various and interrelated toxicity pathways in particular ps nps increased intracellular reactive oxygen species in human placental cells which can induce dna damage and lead to cell cycle arrest in g1or g2 phase inflammation and apoptosis our findings provide empirical evidences that the negative effects of nanoplastics on human placental cells and highlight the necessity to conduct risk assessment of nanoplastics on female reproduction and fetal development graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords polystyrene nanoplastics human placental cells pathway based toxicity assessment reproductive toxicity reactive oxygen species data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction microplastics have been widely detected in various water environments e g sea water surface water groundwater wastewater and even drinking water birch et al 2020 microplastics are plastic fragments with a size of 0 1 µm 5 mm and can be decomposed into nanoplastics with a size of 1 100 nm lehner et al 2019 schwaferts et al 2019 ingestion with water is one of the potential pathways for people to be exposed to microplastics nanoplastics wright and kelly 2017 compared to microplastics it is much easier for nanoplastics to penetrate tissues instead of being simply stuck in the guts of living organisms thus posing a risk to tissue cell jeong et al 2016 rist et al 2018 indeed the penetration of nanosized particles into the circulatory system enables nanoplastics to distribute to various tissues and accumulate in organs senathirajah et al 2021 for instance nanoplastics were even detected in placentas and nanoplastic fragments were isolated from placental tissues collected from pregnant women ragusa et al 2021 the placenta is the key interface that regulates the relationship between the fetal and maternal environments through various complex mechanisms prabhudaset et al 2015 increasing evidences obtained from in vivo animal assays showed endocrine disruption and reproductive impairments caused by nanoplastic exposure cui et al 2017 kim et al 2020 for example the crustacean daphnia galeata showed reduced reproduction and abnormal embryonic development after treatment with polystyrene nanoplastics 52 nm 5 µg ml for 5 days cui et al 2017 the number of offspring derived from the nematode caenorhabditis elegans exposed to polystyrene nanoplastics 42 and 530 nm 100 µg ml was also significantly decreased kim et al 2020 these findings revealed that nanoplastics may induce endocrine disruption and adverse birth outcomes however the effects of nanoplastic exposure on reproduction and their potential toxicity mechanisms remain unclear compared with intensive and time consuming in vivo tests with animals in vitro mechanistic pathway analysis based on human cell lines is more sensitive to obtain early warning signals because cellular responses are activated before an injury is sustained fry et al 2019 wilde et al 2018 in recent years the omics method has been widely used in toxic assessment to identify new biomarkers and determine the molecular mechanism of induced toxicity li et al 2022 zeng et al 2021 molecular analysis based on genetic biomarkers has been proven to be promising for the rapid and sensitive high throughput screening needed to assess genetic toxicants attene ramos et al 2015 mezencev and subramaniam 2019 toxicogenomics performed for monitoring multiple biomarkers has been proven to be a fast and sensitive strategy to test genotoxicity identify mechanism and predict adverse health effects mezencev and subramaniam 2019 understanding the cellular pathways activated by nanoplastics interacting with biological systems and implementing high throughput in vitro methods for toxicity assessment of nanoplastics are required for the prediction of nanoplastic impacts on human health owing to the critical roles of the placenta in holding out fetal growth and serving as an interface between the fetus and external environment placental exposure to nanoplastics has received increasing attentions this study aimed to use human placental choriocarcinoma cells as a target tissue model to evaluate the potential toxicological mechanisms related to nanoplastic exposure polystyrene nanoplastics ps nps were selected given the fact that ps nps are among the most produced and widely found in the aquatic environment and have been detected in placental tissues due to their easy absorption feature onto the surface of cells kim et al 2020 senathirajah et al 2021 in addition the physical parameters of nanoplastics e g the size or surface charge of ps nps determine their toxicity therefore 4 different sizes 25 50 100 and 500 nm and 3 types of surface charges nh2 cooh and unlabeled were employed to investigate the relationship between the size or surface charge of ps nps and the corresponding biological effects our findings provide insights into the mechanism of the subcellular toxicity induced by ps nps to help better understand the potential chronic effects of ps np exposure which are useful for evaluating the safety of nanoplastics and their health risks to humans 2 materials and methods 2 1 ps np preparation and characterization a ps np stock solution 50 mg ml 10 ml was purchased from beijing zhongkeleiming technology company beijing china the ps nps of four different sizes 25 50 100 and 500 nm code ps000025 50 100 and 500 were dispersed in deionized water in each size group nh2 labeled ps ps nh2 nps cooh labeled ps ps cooh nps and unlabeled ps nps were studied to compare the effect of different surface charges the nh2 and cooh groups were labeled with ps nps via the coupling reaction of functional groups kim et al 2014 the size and morphology of ps nps were measured by using the transmission electron microscopy tem images jem 2100 jeol japan the size distributions and zeta potential of the ps nps were verified with a nano zeta potential analyzer zs90 malvern uk 2 2 human placental cell culture the preparation of the human placental choriocarcinoma jeg 3 cells was same as our previous study shen et al 2021 briefly the jeg 3 cells were seeded in corning plastic flasks and cultured in minimum essential medium mem containing 10 fetal bovine serum fbs 1 penicillin and streptomycin thermo fisher scientific shanghai china cells were grown in an incubator mco 15ac sanyo japan supplied with 5 co2 at 37 c when the cell density was approximately 80 the jeg 3 cells were digested with 0 25 trypsin and passaged at a 1 2 ratio 2 3 cytotoxicity assessment jeg 3 cells were seeded in 96 well plates at a concentration of 105 cells ml and cultured until reaching 80 confluency then the cells were exposed to different types of ps nps at various concentrations for 24 h a recent study estimated that each person potentially ingests 0 1 5 0 g of microplastics every week senathirajah et al 2021 there is short of quantitative data of nps in the aquatic environment because of lacking sophisticated detection techniques considering continuous degradation of microplastics and release into environment the levels of nanoplastics will increase concurrently therefore we chose a wide range of ps nps concentrations 0 20 39 78 156 313 625 1250 2500 and 5000 μg ml that cover different exposure scenarios to assess ps nps effects in this study the exposure medium was removed and replaced by 0 5 mg ml 3 4 5 dimethylthiazol 2 yl 2 5

sulfoxide dmso aladdin shanghai china 200 μl well was added to dissolve water insoluble formazan after centrifugation a microplate reader was used to measure the absorbance at 570 nm cell viability is expressed as the percentage of absorbance with respect to the absorbance of control samples biological triplicate experiments were carried out for each exposure condition 2 4 protein kinase a pka activity assay jeg 3 cells were seeded at a concentration of 105 cells ml in 100 mm dishes with 10 ml of medium and exposed to ps np sample for 24 h it was reported that the average intake of ps particle was 19 μg ml hwang et al 2020 and combined with cytotoxicity results the concentration of 20 μg ml which induced less than 20 cells inactivated was selected as exposure concentration jeg 3 cells were harvested with 0 25 trypsin and washed with 5 ml of pbs a nonradioactive protein kinase a pka detection kit promega beijing china was used for a peptag assay wang et al 2017 briefly pka extraction buffer was added into jeg 3 cells and a homogenizer was used for homogenization then the supernatant was incubated with pka reaction buffer a1 peptide and pka activator solution for 30 min the reaction was stopped by placing the tube in a water bath at 95 c and a 0 8 agarose gel was prepared in advance for analysis the ultraviolet light was used for the view of the gel melted agarose of each sample was mixed with gel solubilization reagent and glacial acetic acid aladdin shanghai china then the samples were transferred to a 96 well plate and the optical density of each well was determined at 570 nm with a microplate reader the bands were recovered and quantified to calculate the relative density that represented the level of activated pka besides peptide free agarose was chosen as the blank three independent experiments were carried out with each ps np sample 2 5 intercellular ros determination jeg 3 cells were seeded into 96 well plates at a concentration of 105

winooski vt usa intracellular reactive oxidative species ros production was expressed as the fold change in fluorescence compared to the control samples ros production of each treatment was measured in at least 3 replicates 2 6 cell cycle assessment jeg 3 cells were seeded in 6 well plates at a concentration of 105 cells ml in 2 ml of medium per well and the culture medium of jeg 3 cells at 80 confluency was removed then the cells in the 25 nm and 50 nm diameter groups were exposed to 31 25 62 5 and 125 μg ml ps nps and cells in the 100 nm and 500 nm diameter groups were exposed to 125 250 and 500 μg ml ps nps after 24 h of exposure the jeg 3 cells were digested with 0 25 trypsin and washed with pbs ph 7 4 the cells were resuspended in pbs supplemented with propidium iodide pi 50 μg ml aladdin shanghai china and incubated in the dark for 10 min the cell cycle distribution was analyzed with a flow cytometer the percentages of cells in the g1 s and g2 phases based on dna distribution were calculated each treatment was conducted three times independently 2 7 rt qpcr analysis of mrna expression of toxicity related genes jeg 3 cells were seeded in 6 well plates at a concentration of 2 105 cells well and after 48 h in culture these cells were exposed to different concentrations of ps nps 0 2 1 5 20 and 100 μg ml for 24 h the total rna was extracted from the cell samples with an rnaiso plus kit code 9108 takara dalian china then the rna was converted into cdna using a reverse transcription kit twenty six genes related to different cell responses and a housekeeping gene supplementary table s13 were selected and detected according to our previous study shen et al 2021 the q pcr analysis was performed using sybr green supermix on a lightcycler 480 instrument roche basel switzerland all kits used in this experiment were obtained from takara dalian china each treatment was performed in triplicate 2 8 statistical analysis all toxicity assessment data cell viability pka activity intracellular ros production cell percentage in different phases and gene expression represents mean standard deviation sd on the basis of three independently conducted experiments significant differences were analyzed using spss 25 0 software by one way multi way anova statistically significant difference compared to the control groups p 0 05 p 0 01 and p 0 001 to compare the cytotoxicity and ros generating ability of different ps nps the ic20 value that is the ps np concentration resulting in a 20 reduction in cell viability and the ec1 5 value that is the concentration causing a 1 5 fold increase in fluorescence intensity was determined by the inhibitory curve using graphpad prism version 9 0 pearson s correlation coefficients for the correlations between particle size expressed as lg size and pka activity and those among exposure concentration expressed as lg concentration intracellular ros production and cell viability were conducted by using performanceanalytics r packages version 4 1 0 in addition pearson s correlation coefficients r values and the corresponding p values are presented for the correlations between the sizes of the ps nps and toxic effects cell viability oxidative stress cell cycle arrest pka activity and gene expression alteration to simplify the complex datasets a pca analysis by a covariance matrix was performed on the basis of the gene expression profile in jeg 3 cells exposed to different sized ps nps and to ps nps with different surface charges each pca was performed with the log transformed gene expression data obtained from three independent experiments by assessing the components with the greatest variation using spss 25 0 software and pc1 pc2 and pc3 values were used for mapping 3 results and discussion 3 1 ps nps characterization ps nps used in this study were characterized via tem as well as nano zeta potential analyzer as shown in supplementary fig s1 tem images of ps nps revealed that ps nps had a fairly spherical shape and was consistent with the results of size distribution supplementary fig s2 and supplementary table s1 the average particle sizes of unlabeled ps nps were 24 69 2 58 nm 52 59 2 92 nm 101 40 5 62 nm and 510 14 53 31 nm supplementary fig s2 and supplementary table s1 respectively the average particle sizes of ps nh2 nps and ps cooh nps were also shown in supplementary fig s2 and supplementary table s1 the average zeta potential of 25 nm ps nps was 52 27 2 50 mv for ps nh2 nps 48 40 0 60 mv for ps cooh nps and 39 43 0 76 mv for unlabeled ps nps supplementary table s2 the average zeta potential data of 50 100 and 500 nm ps nps was shown in supplementary table s2 3 2 cytotoxicity induced by the ps nps the cytotoxicity induced by the ps nps of different sizes 25 50 100 and 500 nm and those with different surface charges nh2 cooh and unlabeled was determined by mtt assay with jeg 3 cells supplementary fig s3 4 both the size and surface charge of the ps nps significantly affected the cytotoxic effects as shown in fig 1 and supplementary table s3 4 the smaller the ps np size was the greater the cytotoxicity induced in jeg 3 cells the 25 nm ps nps with three different surface charges induced more than 90 cell death even at concentrations as low as 78 μg ml fig 1 however at concentrations ranging from 625 to 5000 μg ml 500 nm ps nps with different surface charges induced low levels of cytotoxicity which caused the death of only 20 40 of the cultured cells fig 1 this size dependent effect might have been due to the smaller size larger surface area and greater numbers of ps nps with the size of 25 nm than with the size of 500 nm previous studies also showed that smaller ps nps always induced greater cytotoxicity forte et al 2016 frohlich et al 2012 regarding the surface charges ps nh2 nps caused greater cytotoxicity than ps cooh nps and unmodified ps nps fig 1 the ic20 value was in the range of 28 5 70 4 μg ml 44 7 2187 8 μg ml and 183 3 5000 μg ml for the ps nh2 nps ps cooh nps and unmodified ps nps of different sizes respectively fig 1d and supplementary table s8 our cytotoxicity results are consistent with human cell data in previous studies showing that ps nh2 nps were more cytotoxic than ps cooh nps or unmodified ps nps inkielewicz stepniak et al 2018 the surface charge of ps nps is very important for their biological activity ruenraroengsak and tetley 2015 the higher toxicity induced by ps nh2 nps might be associated with a result of the strong ionic interactions between the positively charged ps nps and the negatively charged cell membrane thus leading to lysosome damage and eventually destroying mitochondria and inducing apoptosis bexiga et al 2011 wang et al 2013 the escape of nps from endosomes and phagosomes through the so called proton sponge phenomenon may have been triggered because of the high density of amino groups on the surface of ps nh2 nps novak et al 2014 this effect may have increased the likelihood of direct interactions between amino modified nps and organelles leading to cell death previous studies have demonstrated that positively charged ps nps affected the viability of three types of enterocyte like cells and led to the induction of apoptosis chiu et al 2015 inkielewicz stepniak et al 2018 ruenraroengsak and tetley 2015 notably positively charged nps induce greater cytotoxicity by nonspecifically binding with negatively charged sugar moieties on the cell surface while negatively charged nps impair endocytosis because of rejection chiu et al 2015 lehner et al 2019 these processes can explain the differences in the cytotoxicity of ps nh2 ps cooh and unmodified ps nps observed in this study 3 3 ps nps inhibited pka activity in jeg 3 cells to confirm that ps nps have endocrine disruption potential we measured pka activity in jeg 3 cells after exposure to ps nps and the concentration 20 μg ml that induced less than 20 cell inactivation in cytotoxicity tests was chosen as the exposure concentration for further experiments the inhibition of different types of ps nps on pka activity showed size and charge dependent patterns for ps nps with the same size ps nh2 with a positive charge caused a greater inhibition of pka activity than that induced by ps cooh nps or unmodified ps nps figs 2 a and s5 pka activity was significantly decreased by 30 1 unmodified ps nps 52 1 ps cooh nps and 60 6 ps nh2 nps with the size of 25 nm which was much greater than that induced by ps nps with the size of 50 100 or 500 nm fig 2a and supplementary table s5 for ps nps with the same surface charge there was a negative correlation between the inhibition of pka activity and the ps np size r 0 928 0 996 f 12 493 277 822 which means the smaller size the stronger inhibition on pka activity fig 2b exposure to ps nps may induce endocrine system disrupting effects hou et al 2021 jin et al 2021 the function of the endocrine system is affected by stress and endocrine disruptors chemical pollutants that have adverse effects on the action of normal hormones are called endocrine disruptors bergman et al 2013 gore et al 2015 reproductive system toxicity induced by ps has been found in fish rochman et al 2014 suggesting that endocrine disorders may be caused by ps alone or together with other persistent pollutants for studying nanoplastic entry into systemic circulation we chose to use placental tissue because it is highly perfused and necessary barrier to protect the developing fetus nanoplastics may change several cellular regulatory pathways in the placenta and result in adverse pregnancy outcomes apos the potential mechanisms of nanoplastic toxicity include biofilm damage subcellular toxicity or physical blockage tallec et al 2018 recent studies have demonstrated that inflammation is a potential mechanism of reproductive toxicity induced by ps nps hou et al 2021 jin et al 2021 our findings regarding the inhibition of pka activity induced by ps nps confirmed that these nps affect reproductive health by interfering with hormonal pathways 3 4 ps nps induced intercellular ros production all types of ps nps induced significant intracellular ros in jeg 3 cells compared with the baseline level in the control group figs 3 and s6 and supplementary table s6 7 suggesting that ps nps induce oxidative stress in human placental cells the ability to generate intracellular ros was influenced by the exposure concentrations surface charges and sizes of the ps nps positive correlations r 0 796 0 990 f 5 205 144 163 were found between intracellular ros production and the concentrations 156 2500 μg ml of ps nps with different sizes and those with different surface charges figs 3 and s7 for ps nps of the same size the ps nh2 nps with a positive charge induced higher intercellular ros levels than ps cooh nps or unmodified ps nps figs 3 and s7 these results may be attributed to the enhanced interactions between the ps nh2 nps and the cell membrane which was initially mediated by the powerful electrostatic attraction of these nps to the negatively charged membrane bilayer ruenraroengsak and tetley 2015 for ps nps with the same surface charge the smaller the particle size was the higher the ros level in jeg 3 cells supplementary fig s6 the ec1 5 values were 39 7 77 4 83 8 119 3 372 5 656 4 and 583 1 1903 8 μg ml for the 25 50 100 and 500 nm ps nps respectively fig 3d and supplementary table s8 nps can interfere with intracellular electron transfer to induce the production of ros and destroy redox function fu et al 2014 oxidative stress induction has been found in human skin fibroblasts and murine macrophages exposed to ps nps with a size of 40 90 nm domenech et al 2020 other types of nps and nanocomposites such as ag and zno nps and nanocomposites were also found to induce intracellular ros generation both in human breast cancer and lung cancer cells ahamed et al 2021a 2022a the increase in intercellular ros is generally considered the main reason for the potential toxicity of nps fu et al 2014 loos et al 2014 excessive ros can lead to a variety of damages such as lipid peroxidation or dna fragmentation xie et al 2017 as shown in table 1 and supplementary figs s8 9 significantly negative correlations were found between intracellular ros production level and cell viability in all types of ps nps groups r 0 54 0 79 p 0 01 in addition the correlation between exposure concentration and cell viability was significant in smaller size and surface charge labeled groups while the correlation between exposure concentration and intracellular ros production was significant in all groups table 1 and supplementary figs s8 9 the high reactivity of these ps nps may be associated with the production of ros the increased generation of ros induced by ps nps is considered as a critical mechanism in induced cytotoxicity fu et al 2014 ruenraroengsak and tetley 2015 overproduction of ros induced by exposure to 10 μg ml ps nps or ps microplastics was also observed in human cerebral t98g and epithelial hela cells and oxidative stress was confirmed to be one of the mechanisms involved in ps induced cytotoxicity at the cell level schirinzi et al 2017 a recent study also demonstrated that ros production in human breast cancer cells induced by sno2 doped zno reduced graphene oxide nanocomposites was the primary cause of cytotoxicity ahamed et al 2021b oxidative stress can induce unregulated cell signaling resulting in damage to cell function such as oxidative changes fu et al 2014 it has also been reported that oxidative stress induces reproductive toxicity archibong et al 2018 according to our results increases in ps np induced intracellular ros production was associated with greater inhibition of pka activity in jeg 3 cells therefore oxidative stress may be a potential mechanism underlying the reproductive toxicity induced by ps np disruption of endocrine system function as measured with jeg 3 cells 3 5 ps nps altered the cell cycle progression of jeg 3 cells the cell cycle contains three phases namely the g1 s and g2 phases the activation of every period is decided by the correct accomplishment of the preceding period caglar and biray avci 2020 dna and protein are synthesized in the s and g2 phases respectively cell cycle delay is usually attributed to cellular responses to dna damage and the activation of dna repair machinery chao et al 2017 to further determine whether ps nps impact the cell cycle flow cytometry measurement of the cellular dna content was performed the results showed that both the size and surface charge of the ps nps strongly influenced cell cycle progression fig 4 and supplementary table s9 12 smaller ps nps were capable of delaying entry into the cell cycle the percentage of proliferating cells treated with 25 or 50 nm ps nps in the g2 phase was significantly increased while there was no change observed in the cells treated with 100 or 500 nm ps nps figs 4 and s10 11 more concentrations were assessed for detailed comparison jeg 3 cells were incubated with 25 or 50 nm ps nps at concentrations of 31 25 62 5 or 125 μg ml for 24 h and a concentration dependent increase in cells in the g2 phase was found after treatment with 25 and 50 nm ps nh2 nps supplementary fig s12 in the higher concentration groups jeg 3 cells were exposed to 125 250 and 500 μg ml of 100 and 500 nm ps nps for 24 h and a concentration dependent increase in cells in the g1 phase was observed after treatment with 100 nm ps nh2 nps supplementary fig s12 cell cycle arrest is governed by a series of molecular mechanisms kim et al 2011 and the differences between the low and high concentration groups in our study may have been caused by the induction of different regulatory mechanisms previous studies have demonstrated that both low and high concentration exposure 50 and 200 μg ml 200 and 500 μg ml to nps caused changes in the expression of the genes correlated with pathways related to the cell cycle while only cell groups exposed to a high concentration of nps 200 μg ml and 500 μg ml showed significant cell cycle arrest ding et al 2014 periasamy et al 2016 as shown in figs s13 and s14 the ps nh2 nps caused a greater number of cells to undergo cell cycle arrest in the g2 phase than ps cooh nps or unmodified ps nps underlying the importance of surface charge on cell cycle progression alterations a previous study has shown that the accumulation of amine modified ps nps can damage lysosomes after a long incubation period leading to mitochondrial damage and subsequent apoptosis activation wang et al 2013 kim et al 2013 observed that ps nh2 nps with a diameter of 50 nm induced cell cycle arrest in the g1 phase and inhibited the expression of cyclin d and cyclin e and the toxicity induced by these ps nh2 nps seemed to be mediated by mitochondrial dysfunction and cell membrane rupture which led to an insufficient energy supply and a decreased cell proliferation rate an amine induced ps np mediated cell death via apoptosis mechanisms involving caspase 3 7 and 9 mediated cytotoxicity bexiga et al 2011 3 6 distinct profiles of toxicity related gene expression induced by ps nps gene expression analysis of 26 select toxicity related genes was performed to investigate the potential adverse effects of ps nps in human cells as shown in figs s15 16 and tables s14 25 ps nps of different sizes and those with different surface charges induced distinct gene expression profiles in cells exposed to 25 nm ps nps the expression of most dna repair genes and the antiapoptotic gene bcl 2 was downregulated while the expression of the proapoptotic gene bax oxidative genes and inflammation genes cxcl6 atf3 a20 and ccl2 was upregulated in the ps nh2 np group the expression of a dna damage gene gadd45γ the proapoptotic gene bax oxidative stress genes and inflammation genes cxcl2 cxcl6 atf3 and a20 was upregulated in the ps cooh np group and the expression of dna repair genes ogg1 xrcc1 xpc ercc1 and xpf and the antiapoptotic gene bcl 2 was downregulated in the unmodified ps np group in cells exposed to 50 nm ps nps downregulated expression of dna repair genes and upregulated expression of metal stress genes mt 1x and mt 1f were observed in the ps nh2 np group upregulated expression of genes involved in oxidative stress er stress metal stress and inflammation was observed in the ps cooh np group downregulated expression of dna repair genes and upregulated expression of inflammation genes atf3 and a20 were observed in the unmodified ps np group in cells exposed to 100 nm ps nps the expression of dna repair genes ogg1 xrcc1 xpc ercc1 and xpa and the antiapoptotic gene bcl 2 was downregulated in the ps nh2 np group the expression of most metal stress and inflammation genes was upregulated in the ps cooh np group and the expression of an oxidative stress gene txnrd an er stress gene hsp90b1 and metal stress genes mt 1x and mt 2a was upregulated in the unmodified ps np group in cells exposed to the 500 nm ps nps the expression of most dna repair genes and the antiapoptotic gene bcl 2 was downregulated in the ps nh2 np group the expression of metal stress genes mt 1x and mt 1f and inflammation genes cxcl6 atf3 and a20 was upregulated in the ps cooh np group and upregulated expression of genes involved in oxidative stress er stress metal stress and inflammation was observed in the unmodified ps np group to further evaluate the differences in gene expression profiles of ps nps on the basis of both differing sizes and surface charges a pca was carried out figs 5 and s13 the size and surface charge specific gene expression profiles of the ps nps may be used as fingerprints to enable size clustering or surface charge clustering according to their specific toxicity mechanisms the ps nh2 ps cooh and unmodified ps np expression data did not reveal a common significant or consistent gene change fig 5 illustrated that the gene expression responses induced by ps nps with different surface charges nh2 cooh and unmodified clearly differed the results of the pca performed with ps nh2 and unmodified ps nps showed a clear separation between small ps nps 25 and 50 nm and large ps nps 100 and 500 nm based on their altered gene expression profiles supplementary fig s17 suggesting different sized ps nps induce toxicity through different mechanisms the ps cooh np data did not reveal significant clustering according to size suggesting similarities in gene expression profiles in cells exposed to these ps nps genotoxicity has been considered a relevant endpoint in the evaluation of adverse reactions induced by ps nps mishra et al 2019 in this study dna repair was suppressed in cells exposed to ps nh2 nps and dna damage was induced after exposure to ps cooh nps dna damage can result in different related consequences such as cell mutation cancerogenesis aging and cell death chatterjee and walker 2017 kawanishi et al 2017 abnormal apoptosis was induced in both the ps nh2 and ps cooh np exposure groups zno nps mo zno nps and nanocomposites have been reported to induce apoptosis by the upregulation of bax and downregulation of bcl 2 ahamed et al 2022b the expression of oxidative stress and er stress genes was upregulated in cells exposed to small ps nh2 and ps cooh nps 25 nm and 50 nm nanoplastics have been previously shown to lead to the pathological conditions and inflammation in tissues by triggering oxidative stress necrosis and dna damage lehner et al 2019 it has been reported that ps nh2 nps caused autophagic cell death in raw264 7 and beas 2b cells through the generation of ros and the induction of er stress chiu et al 2015 immune responses especially inflammatory responses play key roles in regulating the mechanism of toxicity induction in normal tissue our results showed that ps cooh np exposure activated the expression of inflammation genes nanoplastics in tissues are regarded as foreign matter by the host which may then initiate local immune responses nanoplastics in the human body may accumulate leading to local toxicity induced or enhanced by immune responses wright and kelly 2017 changes in the expression levels of inflammatory response related genes in human intestinal epithelial cells exposed to ps nps has been observed in previous study and these changes caused mild stress induction cortés et al 2020 the genotoxicity results in the present study can be considered relevant information for health risk assessment related to ps np exposure 3 7 the potential mechanisms of cellular toxicity induced by ps nps in order to determine the influence of different factors including exposure concentrations size and surface charge of ps nps on toxic effects the multi way analysis of variance was performed as shown in supplementary table s26 all the three factors had a significant effect on the cell viability and intracellular ros production p 0 001 the size of ps nps had a significant effect on pka activity p 0 01 while the surface charge of ps nps had a significant effect on the cell cycle p 0 05 supplementary table s27 in addition both the size and surface charge of ps nps significantly affected the expression of most toxicity related genes supplementary table s28 to further analyze the correlation between ps np sizes and toxic effects the pearson s correlation coefficients r values were calculated the correlation was increasing stronger as the r value approached the absolute value of 1 and was statistically significant when the p value was 0 05 cell viability r 0 86 0 97 p 0 001 for ps nh2 and r 0 70 0 85 p 0 001 for ps nps and pka activity r 0 57 0 98 p 0 001 were significantly and positively associated with ps np size while oxidative stress r 0 69 0 98 p 0 01 was significantly and negatively associated with ps np size fig 6 a and supplementary table s29 the percentage of cells in the s phase showed a positive relationship with ps np size while the percentage of cells in the g1 or g2 phase was negatively correlated with ps np size fig 6a as shown in fig 6b and tables s30 32 the expression changes in genes involved in dna repair ogg1 mpg xrcc1 xpc and ercc1 dna damage ku70 and gadd45γ apoptosis bcl 2 oxidative stress txnrd er stress hsp90b1 and ugt2b7 metal stress mt 1f and mt 2a and inflammation atf3 and a20 were negatively correlated with ps nh2 np size for the ps cooh np group negative correlations were observed between expression changes in genes involved in dna repair mpg ercc1 xpf and xpa dna damage ku70 and gadd45γ apoptosis bax and bcl 2 oxidative stress txnrd er stress hsp90b1 and ugt2b7 metal stress mt 1a mt 1f and mt 2a and inflammation cxcl1 atf3 and a20 and ps np size for the unmodified ps np group the expression changes in genes involved in dna repair ercc1 and xpa metal stress mt 1f mt 2a and mt 3 and inflammation cxcl1 and atf3 showed a negative correlation with ps np size consistent with our results np toxicity have been previously proved to be significantly correlated with size with small nps related to high bioavailability choi et al 2015 shang et al 2014 the np absorption by cells is the first damage causing step and np size is the decisive factor of np absorption in organisms the size dependent uptake of different ps nps has been previously observed in different cell lines varela et al 2012 in addition a previous study indicated that common ps nps undergo size dependent translocation in an in vitro placental perfusion model grafmueller et al 2015 nps with a larger surface can make increased contact with biological structures previous findings have shown that cationic ps nps induce more adverse effects than anionic ps nps wang et al 2013 many reports have also shown that the uptake rate of positively charged ps nps was significantly higher than that of negatively charged ps nps bexiga et al 2011 the positively charged ps nps interact strongly with the negatively charged cell membrane chiu et al 2015 inkielewicz stepniak et al 2018 wang et al 2013 accordingly in contrast to the effects of negatively charged ps nps positively charged ps nps can lead to mitochondrial damage atp depletion and the death of human bronchial epithelial cells chiu et al 2015 various toxicity pathways were activated by ps nps and they correlated with each other fig 6c direct exposure to ps nps increases intercellular ros in human placental cells which can induce dna damage and lead to cell cycle arrest in g2 phase oxidative stress may also induce inflammation and apoptosis the suppression of dna repair and activation of er stress can aggravate dna damage importantly ps nps inhibit pka activity in human placental cells which results in disruption of endocrine system function and affect reproductive health 4 conclusions plastic has been widely used in modern life while the potential effects of micro and nanoplastics on reproduction and toxicity mechanisms remain unclear which heightens public health concerns in this study human placental cells jeg 3 were employed to evaluate reproductive toxicity of ps nps indicating that ps np size and surface charges were key features of induced nanotoxicity which endows ps nps with their potential health effects the smaller the ps np size was the greater the toxicity induced in jeg 3 cells meanwhile nh2 labeled ps nps caused greater toxicity than cooh labeled and unlabeled ps nps of the same size notably ps nps increased intracellular ros production in jeg 3 cells which can lead to cytotoxicity cell cycle arrest and the inhibition of pka activity our study highlighted that health risks associated with the size and surface charge of ps nps should be carefully considered when designing safer ps nps furthermore long term exposure studies under environmentally relevant concentration are needed to further determine whether ps nps in the human placenta can induce chronic cell responses declaration of competing

15573,nanoplastics as emerging contaminants may be degraded from microplastics and released into aquatic systems globally which pose threats to human health via ingestion with food or water although plastic fragments have been isolated from placental tissues in pregnant women little is known about the direct toxicity of nanoplastics on human placental cells that plays a critical role in maintaining healthy growth of fetus this study explored the mechanistic toxicity of polystyrene nanoplastics ps nps with different sizes 25 50 100 and 500 nm and surface charges nh2 cooh and unlabeled on human placental cells results showed that ps nps had size and surface charge specific toxicity pattern the smaller the ps np size was the greater the toxicity induced on human placental cells in terms of surface charges nh2 labeled ps nps caused greater effects on cytotoxicity inhibition of protein kinase a pka activity oxidative stress and cell cycle arrest compared to cooh labeled and unmodified ps nps ps nps also induced size and surface charge dependent expression profiles of genes involved in various and interrelated toxicity pathways in particular ps nps increased intracellular reactive oxygen species in human placental cells which can induce dna damage and lead to cell cycle arrest in g1or g2 phase inflammation and apoptosis our findings provide empirical evidences that the negative effects of nanoplastics on human placental cells and highlight the necessity to conduct risk assessment of nanoplastics on female reproduction and fetal development graphical abstract image

on request 1 introduction microplastics have been widely detected in various water environments e g sea water surface water groundwater wastewater and even drinking water birch et al 2020 microplastics are plastic fragments with a size of 0 1 µm 5 mm and can be decomposed into nanoplastics with a size of 1 100 nm lehner et al 2019 schwaferts et al 2019 ingestion with water is one of the potential pathways for people to be exposed to microplastics nanoplastics wright and kelly 2017 compared to microplastics it is much easier for nanoplastics to penetrate tissues instead of being simply stuck in the guts of living organisms thus posing a risk to tissue cell jeong et al 2016 rist et al 2018 indeed the penetration of nanosized particles into the circulatory system enables nanoplastics to distribute to various tissues and accumulate in organs senathirajah et al 2021 for instance nanoplastics were even detected in placentas and nanoplastic fragments were isolated from placental tissues collected from pregnant women ragusa et al 2021 the placenta is the key interface that regulates the relationship between the fetal and maternal environments through various complex mechanisms prabhudaset et al 2015 increasing evidences obtained from in vivo animal assays showed endocrine disruption and reproductive impairments caused by nanoplastic exposure cui et al 2017 kim et al 2020 for example the crustacean daphnia galeata showed reduced reproduction and abnormal embryonic development after treatment with polystyrene nanoplastics 52 nm 5 µg ml for 5 days cui et al 2017 the number of offspring derived from the nematode caenorhabditis elegans exposed to polystyrene nanoplastics 42 and 530 nm 100 µg ml was also significantly decreased kim et al 2020 these findings revealed that nanoplastics may induce endocrine disruption and adverse birth outcomes however the effects of nanoplastic exposure on reproduction and their potential toxicity mechanisms remain unclear compared with intensive and time consuming in vivo tests with animals in vitro mechanistic pathway analysis based on human cell lines is more sensitive to obtain early warning signals because cellular responses are activated before an injury is sustained fry et al 2019 wilde et al 2018 in recent years the omics method has been widely used in toxic assessment to identify new biomarkers and determine the molecular mechanism of induced toxicity li et al 2022 zeng et al 2021 molecular analysis based on genetic biomarkers has been proven to be promising for the rapid and sensitive high throughput screening needed to assess genetic toxicants attene ramos et al 2015 mezencev and subramaniam 2019 toxicogenomics performed for monitoring multiple biomarkers has been proven to be a fast and sensitive strategy to test genotoxicity identify mechanism and predict adverse health effects mezencev and subramaniam 2019 understanding the cellular pathways activated by nanoplastics interacting with biological systems and implementing high throughput in vitro methods for toxicity assessment of nanoplastics are required for the prediction of nanoplastic impacts on human health owing to the critical roles of the placenta in holding out fetal growth and serving as an interface between the fetus and external environment placental exposure to nanoplastics has received increasing attentions this study aimed to use human placental choriocarcinoma cells as a target tissue model to evaluate the potential toxicological mechanisms related to nanoplastic exposure polystyrene nanoplastics ps nps were selected given the fact that ps nps are among the most produced and widely found in the aquatic environment and have been detected in placental tissues due to their easy absorption feature onto the surface of cells kim et al 2020 senathirajah et al 2021 in addition the physical parameters of nanoplastics e g the size or surface charge of ps nps determine their toxicity therefore 4 different sizes 25 50 100 and 500 nm and 3 types of surface charges nh2 cooh and unlabeled were employed to investigate the relationship between the size or surface charge of ps nps and the corresponding biological effects our findings provide insights into the mechanism of the subcellular toxicity induced by ps nps to help better understand the potential chronic effects of ps np exposure which are useful for evaluating the safety of nanoplastics and their health risks to humans 2 materials and methods 2 1 ps np preparation and characterization a ps np stock solution 50 mg ml 10 ml was purchased from beijing zhongkeleiming technology company beijing china the ps nps of four different sizes 25 50 100 and 500 nm code ps000025 50 100 and 500 were dispersed in deionized water in each size group nh2 labeled ps ps nh2 nps cooh labeled ps ps cooh nps and unlabeled ps nps were studied to compare the effect of different surface charges the nh2 and cooh groups were labeled with ps nps via the coupling reaction of functional groups kim et al 2014 the size and morphology of ps nps were measured by using the transmission electron microscopy tem images jem 2100 jeol japan the size distributions and zeta potential of the ps nps were verified with a nano zeta potential analyzer zs90 malvern uk 2 2 human placental cell culture the preparation of the human placental choriocarcinoma jeg 3 cells was same as our previous study shen et al 2021 briefly the jeg 3 cells were seeded in corning plastic flasks and cultured in minimum essential medium mem containing 10 fetal bovine serum fbs 1 penicillin and streptomycin thermo fisher scientific shanghai china cells were grown in an incubator mco 15ac sanyo japan supplied with 5 co2 at 37 c when the cell density was approximately 80 the jeg 3 cells were digested with 0 25 trypsin and passaged at a 1 2 ratio 2 3 cytotoxicity assessment jeg 3 cells were seeded in 96 well plates at a concentration of 105 cells ml and cultured until reaching 80 confluency then the cells were exposed to different types of ps nps at various concentrations for 24 h a recent study estimated that each person potentially ingests 0 1 5 0 g of microplastics every week senathirajah et al 2021 there is short of quantitative data of nps in the aquatic environment because of lacking sophisticated detection techniques considering continuous degradation of microplastics and release into environment the levels of nanoplastics will increase concurrently therefore we chose a wide range of ps nps concentrations 0 20 39 78 156 313 625 1250 2500 and 5000 μg ml that cover different exposure scenarios to assess ps nps effects in this study the exposure medium was removed and replaced by 0 5 mg ml 3 4 5 dimethylthiazol 2 yl 2 5

sulfoxide dmso aladdin shanghai china 200 μl well was added to dissolve water insoluble formazan after centrifugation a microplate reader was used to measure the absorbance at 570 nm cell viability is expressed as the percentage of absorbance with respect to the absorbance of control samples biological triplicate experiments were carried out for each exposure condition 2 4 protein kinase a pka activity assay jeg 3 cells were seeded at a concentration of 105 cells ml in 100 mm dishes with 10 ml of medium and exposed to ps np sample for 24 h it was reported that the average intake of ps particle was 19 μg ml hwang et al 2020 and combined with cytotoxicity results the concentration of 20 μg ml which induced less than 20 cells inactivated was selected as exposure concentration jeg 3 cells were harvested with 0 25 trypsin and washed with 5 ml of pbs a nonradioactive protein kinase a pka detection kit promega beijing china was used for a peptag assay wang et al 2017 briefly pka extraction buffer was added into jeg 3 cells and a homogenizer was used for homogenization then the supernatant was incubated with pka reaction buffer a1 peptide and pka activator solution for 30 min the reaction was stopped by placing the tube in a water bath at 95 c and a 0 8 agarose gel was prepared in advance for analysis the ultraviolet light was used for the view of the gel melted agarose of each sample was mixed with gel solubilization reagent and glacial acetic acid aladdin shanghai china then the samples were transferred to a 96 well plate and the optical density of each well was determined at 570 nm with a microplate reader the bands were recovered and quantified to calculate the relative density that represented the level of activated pka besides peptide free agarose was chosen as the blank three independent experiments were carried out with each ps np sample 2 5 intercellular ros determination jeg 3 cells were seeded into 96 well plates at a concentration of 105 cells ml then the jeg 3 cells at 80 confluency were incubated with 150 μl of 2 7 dichlorofluorescein diacetate dcfh da diluted to a final concentration of 10 μm yu et al 2021 after incubated at 37 c for 30 min pbs ph 7 4 was used to wash cells twice then cells were treated with the same exposure concentrations 0 20 39 78 156 313 625 1250 2500 and 5000 μg ml of ps np samples as cytotoxicity assessment after incubation for 2 12 24 and 48 h dichlorofluorescein dcf fluorescence was measured with excitation at 488 nm and emission at 535 nm using a synergy h1 microplate reader biotech winooski vt usa intracellular reactive oxidative species ros production was expressed as the fold change in fluorescence compared to the control samples ros production of each treatment was measured in at least 3 replicates 2 6 cell cycle assessment jeg 3 cells were seeded in 6 well plates at a concentration of 105 cells ml in 2 ml of medium per well and the culture medium of jeg 3 cells at 80 confluency was removed then the cells in the 25 nm and 50 nm diameter groups were exposed to 31 25 62 5 and 125 μg ml ps nps and cells in the 100 nm and 500 nm diameter groups were exposed to 125 250 and 500 μg ml ps nps after 24 h of exposure the jeg 3 cells were digested with 0 25 trypsin and washed with pbs ph 7 4 the cells were resuspended in pbs supplemented with propidium iodide pi 50 μg ml aladdin shanghai china and incubated in the dark for 10 min the cell cycle distribution was analyzed with a flow cytometer the percentages of cells in the g1 s and g2 phases based on dna distribution

2 105 cells well and after 48 h in culture these cells were exposed to different concentrations of ps nps 0 2 1 5 20 and 100 μg ml for 24 h the total rna was extracted from the cell samples with an rnaiso plus kit code 9108 takara dalian china then the rna was converted into cdna using a reverse transcription kit twenty six genes related to different cell responses and a housekeeping gene supplementary table s13 were selected and detected according to our previous study shen et al 2021 the q pcr analysis was performed using sybr green supermix on a lightcycler 480 instrument roche basel switzerland all kits used in this experiment were obtained from takara dalian china each treatment was performed in triplicate 2 8 statistical analysis all toxicity assessment data cell viability pka activity intracellular ros production cell percentage in different phases and gene expression represents mean standard deviation sd on the basis of three independently conducted experiments significant differences were analyzed using spss 25 0 software by one way multi way anova statistically significant difference compared to the control groups p 0 05 p 0 01 and p 0 001 to compare the cytotoxicity and ros generating ability of different ps nps the ic20 value that is the ps np concentration resulting in a 20 reduction in cell viability and the ec1 5 value that is the concentration causing a 1 5 fold increase in fluorescence intensity was determined by the inhibitory curve using graphpad prism version 9 0 pearson s correlation coefficients for the correlations between particle size expressed as lg size and pka activity and those among exposure concentration expressed as lg concentration intracellular ros production and cell viability were conducted by using performanceanalytics r packages version 4 1 0 in addition pearson s correlation coefficients r values and the corresponding p values are presented for the correlations between the sizes of the ps nps and toxic effects cell viability oxidative stress cell cycle arrest pka activity and gene expression alteration to simplify the complex datasets a pca analysis by a covariance matrix was performed on the basis of the gene expression profile in jeg 3 cells exposed to different sized ps nps and to ps nps with different surface charges each pca was performed with the log transformed gene expression data obtained from three independent experiments by assessing the components with the greatest variation using spss 25 0 software and pc1 pc2 and pc3 values were used for mapping 3 results and discussion 3 1 ps nps characterization ps nps used in this study were characterized via tem as well as nano zeta potential analyzer as shown in supplementary fig s1 tem images of ps nps revealed that ps nps had a fairly spherical shape and was consistent with the results of size distribution supplementary fig s2 and supplementary table s1 the average particle sizes of unlabeled ps nps were 24 69 2 58 nm 52 59 2 92 nm 101 40 5 62 nm and 510 14 53 31 nm supplementary fig s2 and supplementary table s1 respectively the average particle sizes of ps nh2 nps and ps cooh nps were also shown in supplementary fig s2 and supplementary table s1 the average zeta potential of 25 nm ps nps was 52 27 2 50 mv for ps nh2 nps 48 40 0 60 mv for ps cooh nps and 39 43 0 76 mv for unlabeled ps nps supplementary table s2 the average zeta potential data of 50 100 and 500 nm ps nps was shown in supplementary table s2 3 2 cytotoxicity induced by the ps nps the cytotoxicity induced by the ps nps of different sizes 25 50 100 and 500 nm and those with different surface charges nh2 cooh and unlabeled was determined by mtt assay with jeg 3 cells supplementary fig s3 4 both the size and surface charge of the ps nps significantly affected the cytotoxic effects as shown in fig 1 and supplementary table s3 4 the smaller the ps np size was the greater the cytotoxicity induced in jeg 3 cells the 25 nm ps nps with three different surface charges induced more than 90 cell death even at concentrations as low as 78 μg ml fig 1 however at concentrations ranging from 625 to 5000 μg ml 500 nm ps nps with different surface charges induced low levels of cytotoxicity which caused the death of only 20 40 of the cultured cells fig 1 this size dependent effect might have been due to the smaller size larger surface area and greater numbers of ps nps with the size of 25 nm than with the size of 500 nm previous studies also showed that smaller ps nps always induced greater cytotoxicity forte et al 2016 frohlich et al 2012 regarding the surface charges ps nh2 nps caused greater cytotoxicity than ps cooh nps and unmodified ps nps fig 1 the ic20 value was in the range of 28 5 70 4 μg ml 44 7 2187 8 μg ml and 183 3 5000 μg ml for the ps nh2 nps ps cooh nps and unmodified ps nps of different sizes respectively fig 1d and supplementary table s8 our cytotoxicity results are consistent with human cell data in previous studies showing that ps nh2 nps were more cytotoxic than ps cooh nps or unmodified ps nps inkielewicz stepniak et al 2018 the surface charge of ps nps is very important for their biological activity ruenraroengsak and tetley 2015 the higher toxicity induced by ps nh2 nps might be associated with a result of the strong ionic interactions between the positively charged ps nps and the negatively charged cell membrane thus leading to lysosome damage and eventually destroying mitochondria and inducing apoptosis bexiga et al 2011 wang et al 2013 the escape of nps from endosomes and phagosomes through the so called proton sponge phenomenon may have been triggered because of the high density of amino groups on the surface of ps nh2 nps novak et al 2014 this effect may have increased the likelihood of direct interactions between amino modified nps and organelles leading to cell death previous studies have demonstrated that positively charged ps nps affected the viability of three types of enterocyte like cells and led to the induction of apoptosis chiu et al 2015 inkielewicz stepniak et al 2018 ruenraroengsak and tetley 2015 notably positively charged nps induce greater cytotoxicity by nonspecifically binding with negatively charged sugar moieties on the cell surface while negatively charged nps impair endocytosis because of rejection chiu et al 2015 lehner et al 2019 these processes can explain the differences in the cytotoxicity of ps nh2 ps cooh and unmodified ps nps observed in this study 3 3 ps nps inhibited pka activity in jeg 3 cells to confirm that ps nps have endocrine disruption potential we measured pka activity in jeg 3 cells after exposure to ps nps and the concentration 20 μg ml that induced less than 20 cell inactivation in cytotoxicity tests was chosen as the exposure concentration for further experiments the inhibition of different types of ps nps on pka activity showed size and charge dependent patterns for ps nps with the same size ps nh2 with a positive charge caused a greater inhibition of pka activity than that induced by ps cooh nps or unmodified ps nps figs 2 a and s5 pka activity was significantly decreased by 30 1 unmodified ps nps 52 1 ps cooh nps and 60 6 ps nh2 nps with the size of 25 nm which was much greater than that induced by ps nps with the size of 50 100 or 500 nm fig 2a and supplementary table s5 for ps nps with the same surface charge there was a negative correlation between the inhibition of pka activity and the ps np size r 0 928 0 996 f 12 493 277 822 which means the smaller size the stronger inhibition on pka activity fig 2b exposure to ps nps may induce endocrine system disrupting effects hou et al 2021 jin et al 2021 the function of the endocrine system is affected by stress and endocrine disruptors chemical pollutants that have adverse effects on the action of normal hormones are called endocrine disruptors bergman et al 2013 gore et al 2015 reproductive system toxicity induced by ps has been found in fish rochman et al 2014 suggesting that endocrine disorders may be caused by ps alone or together with other persistent pollutants for studying nanoplastic entry into systemic circulation we chose to use placental tissue because it is highly perfused and necessary barrier to protect the developing fetus nanoplastics may change several cellular regulatory pathways in the placenta and result in adverse pregnancy outcomes apos the potential mechanisms of nanoplastic toxicity include biofilm damage subcellular toxicity or physical blockage tallec et al 2018 recent studies have demonstrated that inflammation is a potential mechanism of reproductive toxicity induced by ps nps hou et al 2021 jin et al 2021 our findings regarding the inhibition of pka activity induced by ps nps confirmed that these nps affect reproductive health by interfering with hormonal pathways 3 4 ps nps induced intercellular ros production all types of ps nps induced significant intracellular ros in jeg 3 cells compared with the baseline level in the control group figs 3 and s6 and supplementary table s6 7 suggesting that ps nps induce oxidative stress in human placental cells the ability to generate intracellular ros was influenced by the exposure concentrations surface charges and sizes of the ps nps positive correlations r 0 796 0 990 f 5 205 144 163 were found between intracellular ros production and the concentrations 156 2500 μg ml of ps nps with different sizes and those with different surface charges figs 3 and s7 for ps nps of the same size the ps nh2 nps with a positive charge induced higher intercellular ros levels than ps cooh nps or unmodified ps nps figs 3 and s7 these results may be attributed to the enhanced interactions between the ps nh2 nps and the cell membrane which was initially mediated by the powerful electrostatic attraction of these nps to the negatively charged membrane bilayer ruenraroengsak and tetley 2015 for ps nps with the same surface charge the smaller the particle size was the higher the ros level in jeg 3 cells supplementary fig s6 the ec1 5 values were 39 7 77 4 83 8 119 3 372 5 656 4 and 583 1 1903 8 μg ml for the 25 50 100 and 500 nm ps nps respectively fig 3d and supplementary table s8 nps can interfere with intracellular electron transfer to induce the production of ros and destroy redox function fu et al 2014 oxidative stress induction has been found in human skin fibroblasts and murine macrophages exposed to ps nps with a size of 40 90 nm domenech et al 2020 other types of nps and nanocomposites such as ag and zno nps and nanocomposites were also found to induce intracellular ros generation both in human breast cancer and lung cancer cells ahamed et al 2021a 2022a the increase in intercellular ros is generally considered the main reason for the potential toxicity of nps fu et al 2014 loos et al 2014 excessive ros can lead to a variety of damages such as lipid peroxidation or dna fragmentation xie et al 2017 as shown in table 1 and supplementary figs s8 9 significantly negative correlations were found between intracellular ros production level and cell viability in all types of ps nps groups r 0 54 0 79 p 0 01 in addition the correlation between exposure concentration and cell viability was significant in smaller size and surface charge labeled groups while the correlation between exposure concentration and intracellular ros production was significant in all groups table 1 and supplementary figs s8 9 the high reactivity of these ps nps may be associated with the production of ros the increased generation of ros induced by ps nps is considered as a critical mechanism in induced cytotoxicity fu et al 2014 ruenraroengsak and tetley 2015 overproduction of ros induced by exposure to 10 μg ml ps nps or ps microplastics was also observed in human cerebral t98g and epithelial hela cells and oxidative stress was confirmed to be one of the mechanisms involved in ps induced cytotoxicity at the cell level schirinzi et al 2017 a recent study also demonstrated that ros production in human breast cancer cells induced by sno2 doped zno reduced graphene oxide nanocomposites was the primary cause of cytotoxicity ahamed et al 2021b oxidative stress can induce unregulated cell signaling resulting in damage to cell function such as oxidative changes fu et al 2014 it has also been reported that oxidative stress induces reproductive toxicity archibong et al 2018 according to our results increases in ps np induced intracellular ros production was associated with greater inhibition of pka activity in jeg 3 cells therefore oxidative stress may be a potential mechanism underlying the reproductive toxicity induced by ps np disruption of endocrine system function as measured with jeg 3 cells 3 5 ps nps altered the cell cycle progression of jeg 3 cells the cell cycle contains three phases namely the g1 s and g2 phases the activation of every period is decided by the correct accomplishment of the preceding period caglar and biray avci 2020 dna and protein are synthesized in the s and g2 phases respectively cell cycle delay is usually attributed to cellular responses to dna damage and the activation of dna repair machinery chao et al 2017 to further determine whether ps nps impact the cell cycle flow cytometry measurement of the cellular dna content was performed the results showed that both the size and surface charge of the ps nps strongly influenced cell cycle progression fig 4 and supplementary table s9 12 smaller ps nps were capable of delaying entry into the cell cycle the percentage of proliferating cells treated with 25 or 50 nm ps nps in the g2 phase was significantly increased while there was no change observed in the cells treated with 100 or 500 nm ps nps figs 4 and s10 11 more concentrations were assessed for detailed comparison jeg 3 cells were incubated with 25 or 50 nm ps nps at concentrations of 31 25 62 5 or 125 μg ml for 24 h and a concentration dependent increase in cells in the g2 phase was found after treatment with 25 and 50 nm ps nh2 nps supplementary fig s12 in the higher concentration groups jeg 3 cells were exposed to 125 250 and 500 μg ml of 100 and 500 nm ps nps for 24 h and a concentration dependent increase in cells in the g1 phase was observed after treatment with 100 nm ps nh2 nps supplementary fig s12 cell cycle arrest is governed by a series of molecular mechanisms kim et al 2011 and the differences between the low and high concentration groups in our study may have been caused by the induction of different regulatory mechanisms previous studies have demonstrated that both low and high concentration exposure 50 and 200 μg ml 200 and 500 μg ml to nps caused changes in the expression of the genes correlated with pathways related to the cell cycle while only cell groups exposed to a high concentration of nps 200 μg ml and 500 μg ml showed significant cell cycle arrest ding et al 2014 periasamy et al 2016 as shown in figs s13 and s14 the ps nh2 nps caused a greater number of cells to undergo cell cycle arrest in the g2 phase than ps cooh nps or unmodified ps nps underlying the importance of surface charge on cell cycle progression alterations a previous study has shown that the accumulation of amine modified ps nps can damage lysosomes after a long incubation period leading to mitochondrial damage and subsequent apoptosis activation wang et al 2013 kim et al 2013 observed that ps nh2 nps with a diameter of 50 nm induced cell cycle arrest in the g1 phase and inhibited the expression of cyclin d and cyclin e and the toxicity induced by these ps nh2 nps seemed to be mediated by mitochondrial dysfunction and cell membrane rupture which led to an insufficient energy supply and a decreased cell proliferation rate an amine induced ps np mediated cell death via apoptosis mechanisms involving caspase 3 7 and 9 mediated cytotoxicity bexiga et al 2011 3 6 distinct profiles of toxicity related gene expression induced by ps nps gene expression analysis of 26 select toxicity related genes was performed to investigate the potential adverse effects of ps nps in human cells as shown in figs s15 16 and tables s14 25 ps nps of different sizes and those with different surface charges induced distinct gene expression profiles in cells exposed to 25 nm ps nps the expression of most dna repair genes and the antiapoptotic gene bcl 2 was downregulated while the expression of the proapoptotic gene bax oxidative genes and inflammation genes cxcl6 atf3 a20 and ccl2 was upregulated in the ps nh2 np group the expression of a dna damage gene gadd45γ the proapoptotic gene bax oxidative stress genes and inflammation genes cxcl2 cxcl6 atf3 and a20 was upregulated in the ps cooh np group and the expression of dna repair genes ogg1 xrcc1 xpc ercc1 and xpf and the antiapoptotic gene bcl 2 was downregulated in the unmodified ps np group in cells exposed to 50 nm ps nps downregulated expression of dna repair genes and upregulated expression of metal stress genes mt 1x and mt 1f were observed in the ps nh2 np group upregulated expression of genes involved in oxidative stress er stress metal stress and inflammation was observed in the ps cooh np group downregulated expression of dna repair genes and upregulated expression of inflammation genes atf3 and a20 were observed in the unmodified ps np group in cells exposed to 100 nm ps nps the expression of dna repair genes ogg1 xrcc1 xpc ercc1 and xpa and the antiapoptotic gene bcl 2 was downregulated in the ps nh2 np group the expression of most metal stress and inflammation genes was upregulated in the ps cooh np group and the expression of an oxidative stress gene txnrd an er stress gene hsp90b1 and metal stress genes mt 1x and mt 2a was upregulated in the unmodified ps np group in cells exposed to the 500 nm ps nps the expression of most dna repair genes and the antiapoptotic gene bcl 2 was downregulated in the ps nh2 np group the expression of metal stress genes mt 1x and mt 1f and inflammation genes cxcl6 atf3 and a20 was upregulated in the ps cooh np group and upregulated expression of genes involved in oxidative stress er stress metal stress and inflammation was observed in the unmodified ps np group to further evaluate the differences in gene expression profiles of ps nps on the basis of both differing sizes and surface charges a pca was carried out figs 5 and s13 the size and surface charge specific gene expression profiles of the ps nps may be used as fingerprints to enable size clustering or surface charge clustering according to their specific toxicity mechanisms the ps nh2 ps cooh and unmodified ps np expression data did not reveal a common significant or consistent gene change fig 5 illustrated that the gene expression responses induced by ps nps with different surface charges nh2 cooh and unmodified clearly differed the results of the pca performed with ps nh2 and unmodified ps nps showed a clear separation between small ps nps 25 and 50 nm and large ps nps 100 and 500 nm based on their altered gene expression profiles supplementary fig s17 suggesting different sized ps nps induce toxicity through different mechanisms the ps cooh np data did not reveal significant clustering according to size suggesting similarities in gene expression profiles in cells exposed to these ps nps genotoxicity has been considered a relevant endpoint in the evaluation of adverse reactions induced by ps nps mishra et al 2019 in this study dna repair was suppressed in cells exposed to ps nh2 nps and dna damage was induced after exposure to ps cooh nps dna damage can result in different related consequences such as cell mutation cancerogenesis aging and cell death chatterjee and walker 2017 kawanishi et al 2017 abnormal apoptosis was induced in both the ps nh2 and ps cooh np exposure groups zno nps mo zno nps and nanocomposites have been reported to induce apoptosis by the upregulation of bax and downregulation of bcl 2 ahamed et al 2022b the expression of oxidative stress and er stress genes was upregulated in cells exposed to small ps nh2 and ps cooh nps 25 nm and 50 nm nanoplastics have been previously shown to lead to the pathological conditions and inflammation in tissues by triggering oxidative stress necrosis and dna damage lehner et al 2019 it has been reported that ps nh2 nps caused autophagic cell death in raw264 7 and beas 2b cells through the generation of ros and the induction of er stress chiu et al 2015 immune responses especially inflammatory responses play key roles in regulating the mechanism of toxicity induction in normal tissue our results showed that ps cooh np exposure activated the expression of inflammation genes nanoplastics in tissues are regarded as foreign matter by the host which may then initiate local immune responses nanoplastics in the human body may accumulate leading to local toxicity induced or enhanced by immune responses wright and kelly 2017 changes in the expression levels of inflammatory response related genes in human intestinal epithelial cells exposed to ps nps has been observed in previous study and these changes caused mild stress induction cortés et al 2020 the genotoxicity results in the present study can be considered relevant information for health risk assessment related to ps np exposure 3 7 the potential mechanisms of cellular toxicity induced by ps nps in order to determine the influence of different factors including exposure concentrations size and surface charge of ps nps on toxic effects the multi way analysis of variance was performed as shown in supplementary table s26 all the three factors had a significant effect on the cell viability and intracellular ros production p 0 001 the size of ps nps had a significant effect on pka activity p 0 01 while the surface charge of ps nps had a significant effect on the cell cycle p 0 05 supplementary table s27 in addition both the size and surface charge of ps nps significantly affected the expression of most toxicity related genes supplementary table s28 to further analyze the correlation between ps np sizes and toxic effects the pearson s correlation coefficients r values were calculated the correlation was increasing stronger as the r value approached the absolute value of 1 and was statistically significant when the p value was 0 05 cell viability r 0 86 0 97 p 0 001 for ps nh2 and r 0 70 0 85 p 0 001 for ps nps and pka activity r 0 57 0 98 p 0 001 were significantly and positively associated with ps np size while oxidative stress r 0 69 0 98 p 0 01 was significantly and negatively associated with ps np size fig 6 a and supplementary table s29 the percentage of cells in the s phase showed a positive relationship with ps np size while the percentage of cells in the g1 or g2 phase was negatively correlated with ps np size fig 6a as shown in fig 6b and tables s30 32 the expression changes in genes involved in dna repair ogg1 mpg xrcc1 xpc and ercc1 dna damage ku70 and gadd45γ apoptosis bcl 2 oxidative stress txnrd er stress hsp90b1 and ugt2b7 metal stress mt 1f and mt 2a and inflammation atf3 and a20 were negatively correlated with ps nh2 np size for the ps cooh np group negative correlations were observed between expression changes in genes involved in dna repair mpg ercc1 xpf and xpa dna damage ku70 and gadd45γ apoptosis bax and bcl 2 oxidative stress txnrd er stress hsp90b1 and ugt2b7 metal stress mt 1a mt 1f and mt 2a and inflammation cxcl1 atf3 and a20 and ps np size for the unmodified ps np group the expression changes in genes involved in dna repair ercc1 and xpa metal stress mt 1f mt 2a and mt 3 and inflammation cxcl1 and atf3 showed a negative correlation with ps np size consistent with our results np toxicity have been previously proved to be significantly correlated with size with small nps related to high bioavailability choi et al 2015 shang et al 2014 the np absorption by cells is the first damage causing step and np size is the decisive factor of np absorption in organisms the size dependent uptake of different ps nps has been previously observed in different cell lines varela et al 2012 in addition a previous study indicated that common ps nps undergo size dependent translocation in an in vitro placental perfusion model grafmueller et al 2015 nps with a larger surface can make increased contact with biological structures previous findings have shown that cationic ps nps induce more adverse effects than anionic ps nps wang et al 2013 many reports have also shown that the uptake rate of positively charged ps nps was significantly higher than that of negatively charged ps nps bexiga et al 2011 the positively charged ps nps interact strongly with the negatively charged cell membrane chiu et al 2015 inkielewicz stepniak et al 2018 wang et al 2013 accordingly in contrast to the effects of negatively charged ps nps positively charged ps nps can lead to mitochondrial damage atp depletion and the death of human bronchial epithelial cells chiu et al 2015 various toxicity pathways were activated by ps nps and they correlated with each other fig 6c direct exposure to ps nps increases intercellular ros in human placental cells which can induce dna damage and lead to cell cycle arrest in g2 phase oxidative stress may also induce inflammation and apoptosis the suppression of dna repair and activation of er stress can aggravate dna damage importantly ps nps inhibit pka activity in human placental cells which results in disruption of endocrine system function and affect reproductive health 4 conclusions plastic has been widely used in modern life while the potential effects of micro and nanoplastics on reproduction and toxicity mechanisms remain unclear which heightens public health concerns in this study human placental cells jeg 3 were employed to evaluate reproductive toxicity of ps nps indicating that ps np size and surface charges were key features of induced nanotoxicity which endows ps nps with their potential health effects the smaller the ps np size was the greater the toxicity induced in jeg 3 cells meanwhile nh2 labeled ps nps caused greater toxicity than cooh labeled and unlabeled ps nps of the same size notably ps nps increased intracellular ros production in jeg 3 cells which can lead to cytotoxicity cell cycle arrest and the

15574,as a product of phosphorous recovery from anaerobic digestion ad of waste activated sludge was vivianite has received increasing attention however key factors controlling vivianite formation have not yet been fully addressed thus this study was initiated to ascertain key factors controlling vivianite formation a simulation of chemical equilibriums indicates that interfering ions such as metallic ions and inorganic compounds may affect vivianite formation especially at a po4 3 concentration lower than 3 mm the experiments demonstrated that the rate of ferric bio reduction conducted by dissimilatory metal reducing bacteria dmrb and the competition of methane producing bacteria mpb with dmrb for vfas acetate were not the key factors controlling vivianite formation and that ferric bio reduction of dmrb can proceed when a sufficient amount of fe3 exists in was the determined affinity constants ks of both dmrb and mpb on acetate revealed that the khac constant 4 2 mmol g vss of dmrb was almost 4 times lower than that of mpb 15 67 mmol g vss and thus mpb could not seriously compete for vfas acetate with dmrb as a result vivianite formation was controlled mainly by the amount of fe3 in was in practice a fe p molar ratio of 2 1 should be enough for vivianite formation in ad of was otherwise exogenously dosing fe3 or fe2 into ad must be applied in ad graphical abstract image

perhaps 100 years hao et al 2013 cao et al 2019 wu et al 2019 as a result a p crisis century has started so that p recovery from animal wastes and wastewater is now an issue of considerable importance hao et al 2013 among others waste activated sludge was produced in wastewater treatment plants wwtps contains a considerable amount up to 90 of influent p load and thus is potentially a valuable source for p recovery egle et al 2016 with this approach the global p recovery from was could meet 15 20 of the world p demand li and li 2017 zhang et al 2020 vivianite fe3 po4 2 8h2o is a remarkably stable ferrophosphorus compound tessadri et al 2000 and common in anaerobic environments rich in iron and phosphorous such as soils and deep lake sediments árpád et al 2021 rothe et al 2016 wu et al 2019 vivianite has also been found in pipelines prot et al 2021 and was in wwtps wilfert et al 2016 wu et al 2019 and accounts for a majority of phosphorous and iron in anaerobic digestion ad of was wilfert et al 2018 if vivianite can be recovered from was a novel approach to p recovery from wastewater may be established beyond struvite hao et al 2013 interestingly this approach has recently attracted substantial attention with a number of studies on it being carried out wilfert et al 2016 2018 wang et al 2020 wu et al 2020a zhang et al 2020 fe in was mainly comes from ferric salt added in wastewater treatment for chemical p removal cpr improving was dewatering performance wilfert et al 2015 and preventing pipeline corrosion and h2s generation wei et al 2017 during ad of was fe3 is biologically reduced to fe2 by dissimilatory metal reducing bacteria dmrb at the same time po4 3 is released from cell lysis and organic p degradation by microorganisms in ad as a result vivianite can be chemically formed if the solubility product reaches its threshold ksp 10 36 wang et al 2020 as expressed by eq 1 however other ions in ad can also combine with po4 3 or fe2 and form insoluble sediments thus affecting vivianite formation metal cations such as ca2 mg2 and al3 could be combined with po4 3 to form other insoluble phosphates moreover some anions such as s2 could be combined with fe2 and thus other iron compounds could be formed common interfering ions and possible reactions associated with po4 3 and fe2 are shown in fig s1 some researchers have observed calcium and magnesium phosphates wilfert et al 2018 and other iron compound impurities in vivianite roussel and carliell marquet 2016 if vivianite can be separated and recovered from digested sludge it would be a notable benefit as it is not only as a p rich compound equivalent to struvite in the p content but also a high value added product in making lithium batteries priambodo et al 2017 and even as a gem collection zhang et al 2020 1 3 f e 2 2 po 4 3 8 h 2 o f e 3 p o 4 2 8 h 2 o there are two problems with vivianite recovery from ad i how to improve p recovery efficiency ii how to separate vivianite from digested sludge firstly in order to improve p recovery efficiency it is necessary to fully understand the mechanisms of vivianite formation and to determine key controlling factors that was the goal of this study there are many concerns about controlling factors such as competition of mpb and dmrb for acetate ferric bio reduction rate of dmrb fe p ratio interfering ions etc of course temperature and iron sources in ad would also affect vivianite formation something that had already been demonstrated in a previous study cheng et al 2017 thus it is essential to distinguish key factors from all other concerns secondly the separation of vivianite from digested sludge is also an open topic because of tiny particles 20 100 μm of vivianite in digested sludge wilfert et al 2018 although induced crystallization by adding crystal nucleus liu et al 2018 and magnetic separation had been applied for separation wijdeveld et al 2022 with this study the effect of interfering ions on vivianite formation was first simulated with chemical software next the ferric iron bio reduction by dmrb and the competition of mpb with dmrb for vfas were experimentally ascertained based on this simulation and these experiments key factors controlling vivianite formation would be revealed 2 materials and methods 2 1 was and inoculum sludge was used in this study was obtained from a sequencing batch reactor sbr with a working volume of 60 l sbr was fed with synthetic wastewater li et al 2019 and operated in a cycle of 22 h aeration and 2 h settlement with hrt 2 d and srt 12 d was was concentrated by the 15 μm sieve and then stored at 4 c for use the inoculum sludge was cultured in a fermenter sartorius biostat b plus german with a working volume of 4 l operating for over 3 years the fermenter was fed with was with feooh simultaneously being added to the fermenter the preparation method of feooh is attached in supplementary materials appendix i the characteristics of was and the inoculum sludge are listed in table 1 2 2 experimental set up 2 2 1 simulating the effects of interfering ions some interfering ions can affect vivianite formation competing for po4 3 with fe2 to form other metallic p compounds and or affect vivianite formation the influential scenario of interfering ions can be simulated with the help of software that describes models of water chemical equilibrium visual minteq version 3 1 this study focused on common cations involved in was such as ca2 mg2 zn2 and nh 4 which can be combined with po4 3 and also on common anions like s2 and co3 2 which can be combined with fe2 the p recovery efficiency in the form of vivianite was set at 90 the parameters approaching actual conditions applied in the simulation are attached in supplementary materials tab s1 2 2 2 exploring the effect of the rate of ferric bio reduction theoretically a fe p molar ratio of 1 5 1 is required for vivianite formation eq 1 however interfering ions may affect vivianite formation by consuming po4 3 and or fe2 thus a high fe p molar ratio was preferred for vivianite formation in other words enhancing the rate of ferric bio reduction by increasing fe2 can be expected to weaken the effects of interfering ions because of this it was considered that ferric bio reduction might be one of the factors controlling vivianite formation therefore a released po4 3 rate should be matched with a sufficiently high rate of ferric bio reduction in the experiments however achieving different rates of ferric bio reduction by regulating the activity of dmrb proved challenging instead directly dosing different fe2 amounts into reactors was applied to stand for different rates of ferric bio reduction as listed in table 2 five tested reactors r1 r5 were added with fecl2 at different testing phases up to the same total amount of fe2 in addition there was a blank test r0 without any fe source added and a control test rfe3 with feooh added fe3 to be biologically reduced zachara et al 2002 based on a triplicate mode a series of 600 ml serum bottles with a 400 ml working volume were used as batch reactors the ratio of was over the inoculum sludge added in the reactors was set at 3 1 g vss g vss based on a previous study hao et al 2017 the total added iron amounts were based on the fe p molar ratio of 2 1 all the reactors were adjusted ph to 7 0 0 1 with naoh 1 m and or hcl 1 m then purged with nitrogen gas n2 for 15 min in order to remove oxygen and finally incubated in a shaker under 35 c fe2 fecl2 was added to each reactor evenly every other 12 h as shown in table 2 2 2 3 exploring the effect of mpb as stated in the introduction mpb inhibits vivianite formation as mpb can compete for vfas with dmrb especially for acetate to suppress the activity of mpb 2 bromoethanesulfonic acid and sodium salt c2h4brnao3s besa were added to the reactors r6 r10 with different dosages 0 5 20 35 and 50 mm along with the fe p molar ratio of 2 1 feooh added forming five reactors labelled from r6 to r10 also a blank test r0 besa was included with 50 mm besa added but with no feooh added 2 2 4 determining affinity constants associated with mpb and dmrb the activity of mpb should fit the monod equation with single substrate describing the relationship between reaction rate and substrate concentration as expressed by eq 2 moreover the activity of dmrb should fit the monod equation with double substrate as expressed by eq 3 2 v v m a x s h a c k h a c s h a c 3 v v m a x s h a c s f e k h a c s f e k f e s h a c s h a c s f e where v reaction

analysis were associated with the experiments including 1 mixed liquor samples were regularly collected from the reactors and were then centrifuged and filtered via 0 45 μm membrane filters to obtain supernatants for analyzing i soluble po4 3 and fe2 by molybdenum blue method and phenanthroline colorimetric method using a uv spectrophotometer cary 5000 german agilent technologies company

oes thermo fisher scientific icap7200 germany after the samples had been digested by concentrated hno3 and h2o2 under 150 c for 2 h hao et al 2017 5 when the ad tests ended after 20 d the samples of mixed liquor were dried out in a dark anaerobic oven at 45 c to prevent vivianite from being oxidized then the dried samples were ground to powders 0 2 mm to confirm the existence of vivianite by using x ray diffraction xrd as shown in fig s2 and also to determine the amount of vivianite formation by the method of chemical sequential extraction according to a previous study uhlmann et al 1990 which is attached in supplementary materials tab s2 the extraction can be divided into 5 forms of p compounds labile p mco3 p fe p ca p and residual p among them fe p includes fe bound p al bound p as well as organic p as both was and the inoculum sludge contained little al table 1 and also only small amounts of organic p fe p in the dried samples could be regarded as vivianite at least approximatively wang et al 2021 wilfert et al 2016 6 the microbial community of mixed liquor was detected using the high throughput sequencing method the genomic dna was extracted and amplified by pcr with 515fmodf 5 gtgyca gcmgccgcggtaa 3 and 806rmodr 5 ggacta cnvgggtwtctaat 3 primer pair 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of interfering ions the simulation demonstrates that the presence of interfering ions can seriously affect vivianite formation especially at a lower po4 3 concentration 3 mm as shown in fig 1 clearly the required amount of fe2 for vivianite formation increases significantly in the presence of interfering ions the fe p molar ratio increases from 1 5 to 5 5 at po4 3 1 mm to obtain the same amount of vivianite above po4 3 5 mm l vivianite formation would not be greatly affected by the fe p molar ratio based on eq 1 a sufficient amount of fe2 is one of the factors controlling vivianite formation with interfering ions making the required fe2 amount considerably higher as a result the rate of ferric bio reduction is crucial in vivianite formation during ad according to a previous study shiba and ntuli 2017 the total p concentration in was is generally between 6 76 and 25 69 mm l and the measured p concentration in the reactors was around 11 7 mm l the simulation reveals that the lowest required fe p ratio is 1 94 and thus the fe p ratio was set at 2 to meet the needs of vivianite formation 3 2 effects of the rate of ferric bio reduction fig 2 presents the effect of the rate of ferric bio reduction on vivianite formation fig 2a indicates the results of sequential phosphorus extraction fraction in sludge from the reactors the fe p percentage in the blank test r0 was the lowest one in all the reactors due to no exogenous fe being added all the reactors in which fecl2 was added r1 r5 tended to have almost the same on the fe p percentage 80 2 87 5 the reactor with feooh added rfe3 had a 65 fe p percentage although it had the same amount of fe3 as fe2 added fecl2 in r1 r5 an almost identical fe p percentage in r1 r5 revealed that vivianite may be formed for a trial period of 20 d no matter what the rate ferric bio reduction is relatively the same fe3 amount in rfe3 as fe2 in r1 r5 did not produce the same amount of vivianite formation the above phenomena could be explained by the process of ferric bio reduction when fe3 in the form of feooh was biologically reduced into fe2 a part of fe2 was instantly combined with fe3 in feooh and formed fe3o4 zachara et al 2002 then fe3o4 gradually reacted with po4 3 in solution and formed vivianite o loughlin et al 2013 thus the speed of vivianite formation by ferric bio reduction was slower than that of directly dosing fecl2 moreover fecl2 could be completely dissolved in solution when added in this way fe2 could also replace and exchange other metal ions already combined with po4 3 for vivianite formation besides its direct combination with po4 3 as a result r1 r5 had more vivianite formation than rfe3 according to the total fe2 concentration biomass supernatant which was measured from mixed liquor all acidized into fe2 by hcl fig 2b the rate of ferric bio reduction conducted by dmrb in rfe3 increased quickly during the first three days and then became a fe2 plateau between 4 and 7 d finally followed by another fast increase the first increase in fe2 demonstrated that there was already a sufficient amount of vfas at the beginning of ferric bio reduction then vfas became exhausted by both dmrb and mpb and thus ferric bio reduction reaction was inhibited by vfas in about 3 d accumulation of vfas by acidification occurred again and then the second increase of fe2 appeared till its maximal value was equivalent to the totally added fecl2 in r1 r5 anyway a full ferric bio reduction was achieved within 10 d the high throughput sequencing data revealed that the main dmrb involved in the reaction was genus rhodoferax ferrireducens as can be seen in fig 3 and tab s3 r ferrireducens could utilize acetate as the only carbon source which could not use other common short chain vfas finneran et al 2003 lovley et al 2004 clearly mpb also utilized acetate for ch4 production therefore mpb could compete for acetate with dmrb and limit the rate of ferric bio reduction if acetate was insufficient combined with figs 2c and 2d the rates of ferric bio reduction and vivianite formation can be further evaluated the dosed fecl2 as in r1 and r2 began with a fast decrease and then proceeded to increase finally experiencing a gradual decrease in fe2 the first quick decrease can be attributed to the dual function of chemical combination to vivianite and biological and or chemical adsorption and then gradually released into solution to be combined by po4 3 and other anionic compounds fig 2c relatively the fe2 amount in rfe3 was at a lower level due to ferric bio reduction and continual combination into vivianite a small peak of fe2 appeared between 4 and 7 d fig 2c which was caused by lack of acetate corresponding to the fe2 plateau in fig 2b fig 2d reveals that po4 3 tended to a fast decrease in all the reactors except for the blank interestingly the decrease in po4 3 in rfe3 did not lag too much behind the quickly dosing fecl2 in r1 and r2 accomplished within 2 d and only 1 d shorter than that in r1 and r2 even for the slowly dosing fecl2 in r4 and r5 the decrease on po4 3 was also quick being accomplished within 5 d on the srt scale 20 d of ad the rate of ferric bio reduction was obviously not a key factor controlling vivianite formation especially based on the decreasing tendency of po4 3 fig 2d more fe2 did not combine with more po4 3 in vivianite formation furthermore the residual fe2 in all of the reactors after vivianite formation within 1 5 d might be combined by other anionic compounds rather than po4 3 fig 2c 3 3 associated microbial community the relative abundance of dmrb and mpb determined by high throughput sequencing is shown in fig 3 and some parameters about r ferrireducens are shown as tab s3 as shown in fig 3 r ferrireducens was determined as a major species of dmrb accounting for more than 90 of dmrb and for 0 08 0 12 of the total biomass population figures that are consistent with a previous study wang et al 2019 the reason could be attributed to i competitive survival strategy in a low acetate and high ammonia environment with greater energy efficiency zhuang et al 2011 ii varied energy conversion pathways pha synthesis for energy storage finneran et al 2003 and co occurrence with methanosarcina at lack of fe3 yee and rotaru 2020 iii resistance to multiple environmental factors such as heavy metals aromatic compounds and nutrient limitation etc risso et al 2009 these features enabled r ferrireducens to adapt quickly to ad and to become the major species of dmrb fig 3 also reveals that mpb accounted for 0 52 of the total biomass population which is 5 7 times higher than dmrb clearly both mpb and dmrb needed to metabolize vfas thus it seemed as if there would be a competition for vfas between them due to differences in physiological characteristics dmrb and mpb adopted different survival strategies dmrb could oxidize acetate completely and produce energy but they were often limited by the amount of electron acceptors i e fe3 thus storing energy and reducing their growth rate may be a survival strategy of dmrb to avoid potential energy shortages conversely mpb could convert acetate completely into ch4 and obtain energy in time for growth because of this the population of mpb was higher than that of dmrb 3 4 effects of methane producing bacteria mpb 3 4 1 inhibited activity of mpb with besa increasingly added to the reactors the activity of mpb was gradually inhibited and the ch4 production tended to decrease as shown in supplementary materials fig s3 with 50 mg l of besa dosed in r10 ch4 production almost totally ceased thus the blank reactor r0 besa was added with 50 mg l of besa under these circumstances the interferences of mpb on dmrb were fully eliminated 3 4 2 vivianite formation without the interference of mpb fig 4 recorded the conditions of vivianite information when mpb was inhibited as shown in fig 4a vivianite formation gradually increased from 66 8 to 75 7 along with increased dosages of besa indicating that the inhibited activity of mpb could be helpful for dmrb and also for vivianite formation compared to the results shown in fig 2a rfe3 65 vivianite however the maximal vivianite formation under the inhibited conditions of mpb was only reached 75 7 r10 with 50 mg l of besa added demonstrating an increase by about 10 in vivianite formation the compared results revealed that mpb affected dmrb on consuming vfas acetate but its influential extent on dmrb was only a minor factor an interesting phenomenon occurred in the blank reactor r0 besa in which the amount of vivianite formation 21 7 was about 10 less than that in r0 31 6 fig 2a when the activity of mpb was totally inhibited in r0 besa vivianite formation should increase in principle even though no feooh was added both blanks could utilize residual fe3 contained in was and the inoculum sludge this phenomenon could be explained by two factors decreased ph and or increased co2 in r0 besa first a lower ph was not beneficial to vivianite formation although vivianite can be formed in a wide ph range 6 9 liu et al 2018 the ph values in r0 and r0 besa were 7 2 and 6 8 respectively when besa was added in r0 besa the ch4 production was inhibited and acidification fig 4b gradually decreased ph which was not favorable to vivianite formation second the concentration of co2 in r0 besa would increase due to the inhibited activity of mpb which generally caused the increased concentration of co2 3 due to a greater partial pressure of co2 in the reactor sander 2015 as a result mco3 p would increase and thus vivianite formation was inhibited based on the content of mco3 p in both r0 and r0 besa the latter was about 10 higher than the former which corresponded closely to the difference of 10 in vivianite formation the same phenomenon also occurred in the other reactors r7 to r10 from this aspect vivianite formation recorded in fig 4a shows a comprehensive net result of vivianite formation enhanced by inhibiting mpb and the appearance of mco3 p due to co2 formed this tendency of vfas fig 4b demonstrates that a higher dosage of besa was needed to inhibit the activity of mpb with 50 mg l of besa dosed in the activity of mpb was almost completely inhibited which can be seen from the accumulated vfas at the end of the tests 20 d more vfas including acetate were left over however there were lower concentrations of vfas in r6 without besa dosed in and no acetate was left over at the end of the tests indicating that mpb were consuming acetate for ch4 production at the same time as vivianite formation the effects of mpb on dmrb competing for acetate can be also demonstrated by the process of ferric bio reduction as shown in fig 4c due to the competition of mpb the total amount of fe2 in r6 gradually reached its maximal value on 15 d but the other reactors r7 r10 completed the process of ferric bio reduction on 5 d however the fast process of ferric bio reduction in r7 r10 exerted little effect on vivianite formation as the descending tendency of po4 3 was almost the same as that in r6 fig 4d showing that vivianite formation also depended on the instantly available amount of po4 3 released from bacterial cells with fig 4c the lower half and fig 4d combined for analysis in the initial period of the tests prior to 3 d the rate of ferric bio reduction in r6 r10 was enough to be combined with already released po4 3 at that time indicating that soluble fe2 increased and soluble po4 3 dropped prior to 3 d then soluble fe2 got down and soluble po4 3 increased revealing that more po4 3 was released from bacterial cells wang et al 2022 and the rate of ferric bio reduction that emerged was insufficient to be combined with po4 3 released for vivianite formation till 5 d in 5 d the release of po4 3 became slow and reduced fe2 could be gradually combined with all released po4 3 for vivianite formation in 2 d in short the inhibited activity of mpb was somehow helpful for the ferric bio reduction to a minor extent but more acetate available for dmrb did not stimulate vivianite formation quickly 3 4 3 fitting the curves to the monod equation based on the results from r6 without beas added mixed culture the fitting curves to the monod equation for both mpb and dmrb are illustrated in fig 5 and the key fitting data are shown in table 3 the fitting method and process is attached in supplementary materials appendix ii although there was competition between mpb and dmrb for acetate the khac constant 4 2 mm g vss of dmrb was almost 4 times lower than that 15 67 mm g vss which implied that dmrb could react at a lower acetate concentration than mpb clearly this valuable finding on the affinity constants of dmrb and mpb based on acetate was a reason that mpb could not inhibit dmrb to a large extent as analyzed above moreover khac 15 67 mm g vss of mpb determined in this study approaches the 13 3 mm g vss obtained in a previous study conklin et al 2006 3 5 discussion based on the above analysis interfering ions could affect vivianite formation especially at a lower po4 3 concentration 3 mm as shown in fig 1 however the po4 3 concentration in this study was generally above 3 mm thus vivianite formation was not interfered with by po4 3 under these circumstances the amount of fe3 existing in was became a key factor controlling vivianite information in the tests the fe p molar ratio of 2 1 was exerted and so the amount of fe3 was more than enough for ferric bio reduction and vivianite formation to take place in practice however exogenously dosing fe3 is necessary when the amount of fe3 existing in was is not enough or directly dose fe2 into ad when applicable fe3 in ad must be biologically reduced to fe2 by dmrb to form vivianite therefore the rate of ferric bio reduction is an important issue however the results demonstrate that while the rate of ferric bio reduction was indeed a factor controlling vivianite formation it was not the key factor as long as there were sufficient amounts of fe3 in ad vivianite formation would not be a problem and a considerable amount of vivianite could be expected then the attention for the study was turned to the competition from mpb for vfas acetate with dmrb unexpectedly completely inhibiting mpb activity did not contribute greatly to vivianite formation although full acetate became available for dmrb r ferrireducens a major species only utilizing acetate as carbon source in other words acetate was not a key factor controlling vivianite formation and did not inhibit the ferric bio reduction rate to a large extent the determined affinity constants ks of dmrb and mpb based on acetate reveal that khac of dmrb being almost four times lower than that of mpb was a key reason for the weaker competition from mpb based on acetate with dmrb in conclusion vivianite formation in ad was mainly due to there being enough fe3 contained in was which not only needed to match the amount of po4 3 released from bacterial cells but also required consideration of the effect of interfering ions in practice a fe p molar ratio of 2 1 is sufficient for vivianite formation as dmrb could compete with mpb for acetate the phenomenon of reduced ch4 production would occur with vivianite recovery which could affect energy recovery from wwtps thus balancing the recoveries of energy and vivianite is something that future research should focus on 4 conclusions based on the above analysis and discussion some conclusions can be drawn as follows interfering ions could affect vivianite formation especially at a lower po4 3 concentration 3 mm however the condition affected by po4 3 did not occur as at least 10 mm of po4 3 existed in the tests the rate of ferric bio reduction was one factor controlling vivianite formation but not the key one as it only inhibited vivianite formation to a slight extent rhodoferax ferrireducens was determined as a major species of dmrb accounting for more than 90 of dmrb and for 0 08 0 12 of the total biomass population which was an acetate dependent species the inhibited activity of mpb was somehow helpful for ferric bio reduction to a slight extent but more acetate available for dmrb did not stimulate vivianite formation quickly the difference in the affinity constants khac of dmrb and mpb based on acetate reveals that vivianite formation was not inhibited by mpb or acetate vivianite formation in ad mainly depended on sufficient amounts of fe3 existing in was with an fe p molar ratio of 2 1 being enough for

attracted substantial attention with a number of studies on it being carried out wilfert et al 2016 2018 wang et al 2020 wu et al 2020a zhang et al 2020 fe in was mainly comes from ferric salt added in wastewater treatment for chemical p removal cpr improving was dewatering performance wilfert et al 2015 and preventing pipeline corrosion and h2s generation wei et al 2017 during ad of was fe3 is biologically reduced to fe2 by dissimilatory metal reducing bacteria dmrb at the same time po4 3 is released from cell lysis and organic p degradation by microorganisms in ad as a result vivianite can be chemically formed if the solubility product reaches its threshold ksp 10 36 wang et al 2020 as expressed by eq 1 however other ions in ad can also combine with po4 3 or fe2 and form insoluble sediments thus affecting vivianite formation metal cations such as ca2 mg2 and al3 could be combined with po4 3 to form other insoluble phosphates moreover some anions such as s2 could be combined with fe2 and thus other iron compounds could be formed common interfering ions and possible reactions associated with po4 3 and fe2 are shown in fig s1 some researchers have observed calcium and magnesium phosphates wilfert et al 2018 and other iron compound impurities in vivianite roussel and carliell marquet 2016 if vivianite can be separated and recovered from digested sludge it would be a notable benefit as it is not only as a p rich compound equivalent to struvite in the p content but also a high value added product in making lithium batteries priambodo et al 2017 and even as a gem collection zhang et al 2020 1 3 f e 2 2 po 4 3 8 h 2 o f e 3 p o 4 2 8 h 2 o there are two problems with vivianite recovery from ad i how to improve p recovery efficiency ii how to separate vivianite from digested sludge firstly in order to improve p recovery efficiency it is necessary to fully understand the mechanisms of vivianite formation and to determine key controlling factors that was the goal of this study there are many concerns about controlling factors such as competition of mpb and dmrb for acetate ferric bio reduction rate of dmrb fe p ratio interfering ions etc of course temperature and iron sources in ad would also affect vivianite formation something that had already been demonstrated in a previous study cheng et al 2017 thus it is essential to distinguish key factors from all other concerns secondly the separation of vivianite from digested sludge is also an open topic because of tiny particles 20 100 μm of vivianite in digested sludge wilfert et al 2018 although induced crystallization by adding crystal nucleus liu et al 2018 and magnetic separation had been applied for separation wijdeveld et al 2022 with this study the effect of interfering ions on vivianite formation was first simulated with chemical software next the ferric iron bio reduction by dmrb and the competition of mpb with dmrb for vfas were experimentally ascertained based on this simulation and these experiments key factors controlling vivianite formation would be revealed 2 materials and methods 2 1 was and inoculum sludge was used in this study was obtained from a sequencing batch reactor sbr with a working volume of 60 l sbr was fed with synthetic wastewater li et al 2019 and operated in a cycle of 22 h aeration and 2 h settlement with hrt 2 d and srt 12 d was was concentrated by the 15 μm sieve and then stored at 4 c for use the inoculum sludge was cultured in a fermenter sartorius biostat b plus german with a working volume of 4 l operating for over 3 years the fermenter was fed with was with feooh simultaneously being added to the fermenter the preparation method of feooh is attached in supplementary materials appendix i the characteristics of was and the inoculum sludge are listed in table 1 2 2 experimental set up 2 2 1 simulating the effects of interfering ions some interfering ions can affect vivianite formation competing for po4 3 with fe2 to form other metallic p compounds and or affect vivianite formation the influential scenario of interfering ions can be simulated with the help of software that describes models of water chemical equilibrium visual minteq version 3 1 this study focused on common cations involved in was such as ca2 mg2 zn2 and nh 4 which can be combined with po4 3 and also on common anions like s2 and co3 2 which can be combined with fe2 the p recovery efficiency in the form of vivianite was set at 90 the parameters approaching actual conditions applied in the simulation are attached in supplementary materials tab s1 2 2 2 exploring the effect of the rate of ferric bio reduction theoretically a fe p molar ratio of 1 5 1 is required for vivianite formation eq 1 however interfering ions may affect vivianite formation by consuming po4 3 and or fe2 thus a high fe p molar ratio was preferred for vivianite formation in other words enhancing the rate of ferric bio reduction by increasing fe2 can be expected to weaken the effects of interfering ions because of this it was considered that ferric bio reduction might be one of the factors controlling vivianite formation therefore a released po4 3 rate should be matched with a sufficiently high rate of ferric bio reduction in the experiments however achieving different rates of ferric bio reduction by regulating the activity of dmrb proved challenging instead directly dosing different fe2 amounts into reactors was applied to stand for different rates of ferric bio reduction as listed in table 2 five tested reactors r1 r5 were added with fecl2 at different testing phases up to the same total amount of fe2 in addition there was a blank test r0 without any fe source added and a control test rfe3 with feooh added fe3 to be biologically reduced zachara et al 2002 based on a triplicate mode a series of 600 ml serum bottles with a 400 ml working volume were used as batch reactors the ratio of was over the inoculum sludge added in the reactors was set at 3 1 g vss g vss based on a previous study hao et al 2017 the total added iron amounts were based on the fe p molar ratio of 2 1 all the reactors were adjusted ph to 7 0 0 1 with naoh 1 m and or hcl 1 m then purged with nitrogen gas n2 for 15 min in order to remove oxygen and finally incubated in a shaker under 35 c fe2 fecl2 was added to each reactor evenly every other 12 h as shown in table 2 2 2 3 exploring the effect of mpb as stated in the introduction mpb inhibits vivianite formation as mpb can compete for vfas with dmrb especially for acetate to suppress the activity of mpb 2 bromoethanesulfonic acid and sodium salt c2h4brnao3s besa were added to the reactors r6 r10 with different dosages 0 5 20 35 and 50 mm along with the fe p molar ratio of 2 1 feooh added forming five reactors labelled from r6 to r10 also a blank test r0 besa was included with 50 mm besa added but with no feooh added 2 2 4 determining affinity constants associated with mpb and dmrb the activity of mpb should fit the monod equation with single substrate describing the relationship between reaction rate and substrate concentration as expressed by eq 2 moreover the activity of dmrb should fit the monod equation with double substrate as expressed by eq 3 2 v v m a x s h a c k h a c s h a c 3 v v m a x s h a c s f e k h a c s f e k f e s h a c s h a c s f e where v reaction

vss based on the batch test results the affinity constants of both mpb and dmrb on acetate can be determined by fitting eqs 2 and 3 2 3 sampling and analysis some essential sampling and routine analysis were associated with the experiments including 1 mixed liquor samples were regularly collected from the reactors and were then centrifuged and filtered via 0 45 μm membrane filters to obtain supernatants for analyzing i soluble po4 3 and fe2 by molybdenum blue method and phenanthroline colorimetric method using a uv spectrophotometer cary 5000 german agilent technologies company respectively apha 2005 ii volatile fatty acids vfas using ion chromatographer 883 basic ic plus metrohm ag 2 1 ml sample of mixed liquor was mixed with 9 ml of hcl 1 mm to acidize and dissolve all

composition was analyzed by a gas chromatographer gc126 shanghai insea 4 other metals in mixed liquor biomass supernatant were measured by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes thermo fisher scientific icap7200 germany after the samples had been digested by concentrated hno3 and h2o2 under 150 c for 2 h hao et al 2017 5 when the ad tests ended after 20 d the samples of mixed liquor were dried out in a dark anaerobic oven at 45 c to prevent vivianite from being oxidized then the dried samples were ground to powders 0 2 mm to confirm the existence of vivianite by using x ray diffraction xrd as shown in fig s2 and also to determine the amount of vivianite formation by the method of chemical sequential extraction according to a previous study uhlmann et al 1990 which is attached in supplementary materials tab s2 the extraction can be divided into 5 forms of p compounds labile p mco3 p fe p ca p and residual p among them fe p includes fe bound p al bound p as well as organic p as both was and the inoculum sludge contained little al table 1 and also only small amounts of organic p fe p in the dried samples could be regarded as vivianite at least approximatively wang et al 2021 wilfert et al 2016 6 the microbial community of mixed liquor was detected using the high throughput sequencing method the genomic dna was extracted and amplified by pcr with 515fmodf 5 gtgyca gcmgccgcggtaa 3 and 806rmodr 5 ggacta cnvgggtwtctaat 3 primer pair 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of interfering ions the simulation demonstrates that the presence of interfering ions can seriously affect vivianite formation especially at a lower po4 3 concentration 3 mm as shown in fig 1 clearly the required amount of fe2 for vivianite formation increases significantly in the presence of interfering ions the fe p molar ratio increases from 1 5 to 5 5 at po4 3 1 mm to obtain the same amount of vivianite above po4 3 5 mm l vivianite formation would not be greatly affected by the fe p molar ratio based on eq 1 a sufficient amount of fe2 is one of the factors controlling vivianite formation with interfering ions making the required fe2 amount considerably higher as a result the rate of ferric bio reduction is crucial in vivianite formation during ad according to a previous study shiba and ntuli 2017 the total p concentration in was is generally between 6 76 and 25 69 mm l and the measured p concentration in the reactors was around 11 7 mm l the simulation reveals that the lowest required fe p ratio is 1 94 and thus the fe p ratio was set at 2 to meet the needs of vivianite formation 3 2 effects of the rate of ferric bio reduction fig 2 presents the effect of the rate of ferric bio reduction on vivianite formation fig 2a indicates the results of sequential phosphorus extraction fraction in sludge from the reactors the fe p percentage in the blank test r0 was the lowest one in all the reactors due to no exogenous fe being added all the reactors in which fecl2 was added r1 r5 tended to have almost the same on the fe p percentage 80 2 87 5 the reactor with feooh added rfe3 had a 65 fe p percentage although it had the same amount of fe3 as fe2 added fecl2 in r1 r5 an almost identical fe p percentage in r1 r5 revealed that vivianite may be formed for a trial period of 20 d no matter what the rate ferric bio reduction is relatively the same fe3 amount in rfe3 as fe2 in r1 r5 did not produce the same amount of vivianite formation the above phenomena could be explained by the process of ferric bio reduction when fe3 in the form of feooh was biologically reduced into fe2 a part of fe2 was instantly combined with fe3 in feooh and formed fe3o4 zachara et al 2002 then fe3o4 gradually reacted with po4 3 in solution and formed vivianite o loughlin et al 2013 thus the speed of vivianite formation by ferric bio reduction was slower than that of directly dosing fecl2 moreover fecl2 could be completely dissolved in solution when added in this way fe2 could also replace and exchange other metal ions already combined with po4 3 for vivianite formation besides its direct combination with po4 3 as a result r1 r5 had more vivianite formation than rfe3 according to the total fe2 concentration biomass supernatant which was measured from mixed liquor all acidized into fe2 by hcl fig 2b the rate of ferric bio reduction conducted by dmrb in rfe3 increased quickly during the first three days and then became a fe2 plateau between 4 and 7 d finally followed by another fast increase the first increase in fe2 demonstrated that there was already a sufficient amount of vfas at the beginning of ferric bio reduction then vfas became exhausted by both dmrb and mpb and thus ferric bio reduction reaction was inhibited by vfas in about 3 d accumulation of vfas by acidification occurred again and then the second increase of fe2 appeared till its maximal value was equivalent to the totally added fecl2 in r1 r5 anyway a full ferric bio reduction was achieved within 10 d the high throughput sequencing data revealed that the main dmrb involved in the reaction was genus rhodoferax ferrireducens as can be seen in fig 3 and tab s3 r ferrireducens could utilize acetate as the only carbon source which could not use other common short chain vfas finneran et al 2003 lovley et al 2004 clearly mpb also utilized acetate for ch4 production therefore mpb could compete for acetate with dmrb and limit the rate of ferric bio reduction if acetate was insufficient combined with figs 2c and 2d the rates of ferric bio reduction and vivianite formation can be further evaluated the dosed fecl2 as in r1 and r2 began with a fast decrease and then proceeded to increase finally experiencing a gradual decrease in fe2 the first quick decrease can be attributed to the dual function of chemical combination to vivianite and biological and or chemical adsorption and then gradually released into solution to be combined by po4 3 and other anionic compounds fig 2c relatively the fe2 amount in rfe3 was at a lower level due to ferric bio reduction and continual combination into vivianite a small peak of fe2 appeared between 4 and 7 d fig 2c which was caused by lack of acetate corresponding to the fe2 plateau in fig 2b fig 2d reveals that po4 3 tended to a fast decrease in all the reactors except for the blank interestingly the decrease in po4 3 in rfe3 did not lag too much behind the quickly dosing fecl2 in r1 and r2 accomplished within 2 d and only 1 d shorter than that in r1 and r2 even for the slowly dosing fecl2 in r4 and r5 the decrease on po4 3 was also quick being accomplished within 5 d on the srt scale 20 d of ad the rate of ferric bio reduction was obviously not a key factor controlling vivianite formation especially based on the decreasing tendency of po4 3 fig 2d more fe2 did not combine with more po4 3 in vivianite formation furthermore the residual fe2 in all of the reactors after vivianite formation within 1 5 d might be combined by other anionic compounds rather than po4 3 fig 2c 3 3 associated microbial community the relative abundance of dmrb and mpb determined by high throughput sequencing is shown in fig 3 and some parameters about r ferrireducens are shown as tab s3 as shown in fig 3 r ferrireducens was determined as a major species of dmrb accounting for more than 90 of dmrb and for 0 08 0 12 of the total biomass population figures that are consistent with a previous study wang et al 2019 the reason could be attributed to i competitive survival strategy in a low acetate and high ammonia environment with greater energy efficiency zhuang et al 2011 ii varied energy conversion pathways pha synthesis for energy storage finneran et al 2003 and co occurrence with methanosarcina at lack of fe3 yee and rotaru 2020 iii resistance to multiple environmental factors such as heavy metals aromatic compounds and nutrient limitation etc risso et al 2009 these features enabled r ferrireducens to adapt quickly to ad and to become the major species of dmrb fig 3 also reveals that mpb accounted for 0 52 of the total biomass population which is 5 7 times higher than dmrb clearly both mpb and dmrb needed to metabolize vfas thus it seemed as if there would be a competition for vfas between them due to differences in physiological characteristics dmrb and mpb adopted different survival strategies dmrb could oxidize acetate completely and produce energy but they were often limited by the amount of electron acceptors i e fe3 thus storing energy and reducing their growth rate may be a survival strategy of dmrb to avoid potential energy shortages conversely mpb could convert acetate completely into ch4 and obtain energy in time for growth because of this the population of mpb was higher than that of dmrb 3 4 effects of methane producing bacteria mpb 3 4 1 inhibited activity of mpb with besa increasingly added to the reactors the activity of mpb was gradually inhibited and the ch4 production tended to decrease as shown in supplementary materials fig s3 with 50 mg l of besa dosed in r10 ch4 production almost totally ceased thus the blank reactor r0 besa was added with 50 mg l of besa under these circumstances the interferences of mpb on dmrb were fully eliminated 3 4 2 vivianite formation without the interference of mpb fig 4 recorded the conditions of vivianite information when mpb was inhibited as shown in fig 4a vivianite formation gradually increased from 66 8 to 75 7 along with increased dosages of besa indicating that the inhibited activity of mpb could be helpful for dmrb and also for vivianite formation compared to the results shown in fig 2a rfe3 65 vivianite however the maximal vivianite formation under the inhibited conditions of mpb was only reached 75 7 r10 with 50 mg l of besa added demonstrating an increase by about 10 in vivianite formation the compared results revealed that mpb affected dmrb on consuming vfas acetate but its influential extent on dmrb was only a minor factor an interesting phenomenon occurred in the blank reactor r0 besa in which the amount of vivianite formation 21 7 was about 10 less than that in r0 31 6 fig 2a when the activity of mpb was totally inhibited in r0 besa vivianite formation should increase in principle even though no feooh was added both blanks could utilize residual fe3 contained in was and the inoculum sludge this phenomenon could be explained by two factors decreased ph and or increased co2 in r0 besa first a lower ph was not beneficial to vivianite formation although vivianite can be formed in a wide ph range 6 9 liu et al 2018 the ph values in r0 and r0 besa were 7 2 and 6 8 respectively when besa was added in r0 besa the ch4 production was inhibited and acidification fig 4b gradually decreased ph which was not favorable to vivianite formation second the concentration of co2 in r0 besa would increase due to the inhibited activity of mpb which generally caused the increased concentration of co2 3 due to a greater partial pressure of co2 in the reactor sander 2015 as a result mco3 p would increase and thus vivianite formation was inhibited based on the content of mco3 p in both r0 and r0 besa the latter was about 10 higher than the former which corresponded closely to the difference of 10 in vivianite formation the same phenomenon also occurred in the other reactors r7 to r10 from this aspect vivianite formation recorded in fig 4a shows a comprehensive net result of vivianite formation enhanced by inhibiting mpb and the appearance of mco3 p due to co2 formed this tendency of vfas fig 4b demonstrates that a higher dosage of besa was needed to inhibit the activity of mpb with 50 mg l of besa dosed in the activity of mpb was almost completely inhibited which can be seen from the accumulated vfas at the end of the tests 20 d more vfas including acetate were left over however there were lower concentrations of vfas in r6 without besa dosed in and no acetate was left over at the end of the tests indicating that mpb were consuming acetate for ch4 production at the same time as vivianite formation the effects of mpb on dmrb competing for acetate can be also demonstrated by the process of ferric bio reduction as shown in fig 4c due to the competition of mpb the total amount of fe2 in r6 gradually reached its maximal value on 15 d but the other reactors r7 r10 completed the process of ferric bio reduction on 5 d however the fast process of ferric bio reduction in r7 r10 exerted little effect on vivianite formation as the descending tendency of po4 3 was almost the same as that in r6 fig 4d showing that vivianite formation also depended on the instantly available amount of po4 3 released from bacterial cells with fig 4c the lower half and fig 4d combined for analysis in the initial period of the tests prior to 3 d the rate of ferric bio reduction in r6 r10 was enough to be combined with already released po4 3 at that time indicating that soluble fe2 increased and soluble po4 3 dropped prior to 3 d then soluble fe2 got down and soluble po4 3 increased revealing that more po4 3 was released from bacterial cells wang et al 2022 and the rate of ferric bio reduction that emerged was insufficient to be combined with po4 3 released for vivianite formation till 5 d in 5 d the release of po4 3 became slow and reduced fe2 could be gradually combined with all released po4 3 for vivianite formation in 2 d in short the inhibited activity of mpb was somehow helpful for the ferric bio reduction to a minor extent but more acetate available for dmrb did not stimulate vivianite formation quickly 3 4 3 fitting the curves to the monod equation based on the results from r6 without beas added mixed culture the fitting curves to the monod equation for both mpb and dmrb are illustrated in fig 5 and the key fitting data are shown in table 3 the fitting method and process is attached in supplementary materials appendix ii although there was competition between mpb and dmrb for acetate the khac constant 4 2 mm g vss of dmrb was almost 4 times lower than that 15 67 mm g vss which implied that dmrb could react at a lower acetate concentration than mpb clearly this valuable finding on the affinity constants of dmrb and mpb based on acetate was a reason that mpb could not inhibit dmrb to a large extent as analyzed above moreover khac 15 67 mm g vss of mpb determined in this study approaches the 13 3 mm g vss obtained in a previous study conklin et al 2006 3 5 discussion based on the above analysis interfering ions could affect vivianite formation especially at a lower po4 3 concentration 3 mm as shown in fig 1 however the po4 3 concentration in this study was generally above 3 mm thus vivianite formation was not interfered with by po4 3 under these circumstances the amount of fe3 existing in was became a key factor controlling vivianite information in the tests the fe p molar ratio of 2 1 was exerted and so the amount of fe3 was more than enough for ferric bio reduction and vivianite formation to take place in practice however exogenously dosing fe3 is necessary when the amount of fe3 existing in was is not enough or directly dose fe2 into ad when applicable fe3 in ad must be biologically reduced to fe2 by dmrb to form vivianite therefore the rate of ferric bio reduction is an important issue however the results demonstrate that while the rate of ferric bio reduction was indeed a factor controlling vivianite formation it was not the key factor as long as there were sufficient amounts of fe3 in ad vivianite formation would not be a problem and a considerable amount of vivianite could be expected then the attention for the study was turned to the competition from mpb for vfas acetate with dmrb unexpectedly completely inhibiting mpb activity did not contribute greatly to vivianite formation although full acetate became available for dmrb r ferrireducens a major species only utilizing acetate as carbon source in other words acetate was not a key factor controlling vivianite formation and did not inhibit the ferric bio reduction rate to a large extent the determined affinity constants ks of dmrb and mpb based on acetate reveal that khac of dmrb being almost four times lower than that of mpb was a key reason for the weaker competition from mpb based on acetate with dmrb in conclusion vivianite formation in ad was mainly due to there being enough fe3 contained in was which not only needed to match the amount of po4 3 released from bacterial cells but also required consideration of the effect of interfering ions in practice a fe p molar ratio of 2 1 is sufficient for vivianite formation as dmrb could compete with mpb for acetate the phenomenon of reduced ch4 production would occur with vivianite recovery which could affect energy recovery from wwtps thus balancing the recoveries of energy and vivianite is something that future research should focus on 4 conclusions based on the above analysis and discussion some conclusions can be drawn as follows interfering ions could affect vivianite formation especially at a lower po4 3 concentration 3 mm however the condition affected by po4 3 did not occur as at least 10 mm of po4 3 existed in the tests the rate of ferric bio reduction was one factor controlling vivianite formation but not the key one as it only inhibited vivianite formation to a slight extent rhodoferax ferrireducens was determined as a major species of dmrb accounting for more than 90 of dmrb and for 0 08 0 12 of the total biomass population which was an acetate dependent species the inhibited activity of mpb was somehow helpful for ferric bio reduction to a slight extent but more acetate available for dmrb did not stimulate vivianite formation quickly the difference in the affinity constants khac of dmrb and mpb based on acetate reveals that vivianite formation was not inhibited by mpb or acetate vivianite formation in ad mainly depended on sufficient amounts of fe3 existing in was with an fe p molar ratio of 2 1 being enough for vivianite formation in ad of was declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to
