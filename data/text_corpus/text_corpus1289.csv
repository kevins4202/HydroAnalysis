efficiency of doc decomposition lapierre and giorgio 2015 mao and li 2019 previous studies have focused on the large rivers such as yukon river and amazonian rivers mayorga et al 2005 wickland et al 2012 while the in situ respiration of doc in the headwaters should be dominant because that young doms tend to decrease from upstream to downstream or from headwaters to main stem mayorga et al 2005 therefore the biodegradability of doc in the bdoc enriched rivers i e river upstream headwaters is critical for a better understanding of riverine c cycling the longchuan river is a headwater tributary of the yangtze river and located in the longitudinal range gorge region prior findings suggested the high co2 emission rates and organic carbon flux in this region because of the intensive agricultural practices and severe soil erosion li et al 2012 lu et al 2012 we choose the longchuan river because of its high potential in co2 production and the enclosed valley environment which imply the high magnitude of the biomineralization and allow us to systematically quantify the biodegradable fraction in headwater rivers jones and mulholland 1998 we conducted the bdoc incubations that aimed at simulating in situ respiration and environmental controls on doc biodegradability we hypothesized that 1 the biodegradable dom will be largely decomposed and the refractory fraction will be incompletely degraded and accumulated after the incubations because the bdoc is preferentially biodegraded hansen et al 2016 2 trophic levels will impact the doc biodegradability because nutrients are the essentials for aquatic metabolism and thus carbon dynamics mao et al 2016 in testing our hypotheses our fieldworks were performed in a bdoc enriched river longchuan and the laboratory experiments were employed to simulate the in situ doc respiration the objectives of this study were to 1 explore the doc biodegradability and temperature sensitivity and 2 examine the variations of dom optical parameters a254 a350 e2 e3 and e4 e6 after laboratory incubations and their indicators for bdoc characterization as well as 3 explore the trophic controls of riverine doc biomineralization our results reported that the dom variations could characterize the riverine bdoc and trophic status largely dominated the biodegradability of doc in the longchuan river this study hopes to supplement available information on aquatic bdoc and further improve the understandings of c emissions in the dry hot valley region 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the longchuan river latitude 24 45 26 51 n longitude 100 56 102 02 e is the headwater tributary of the upper yangtze river and located in the longitudinal range gorge region southwest china fig 1 the mainstem originates from the nanhua county and drains into the jinsha river in the north of yuanmou county with a total length of 244 9 km and a drainage area of 5475 3 km2 the longchuan river lies in a low latitude monsoon climate zone which is characterized by the mean temperatures of 29 8 3 96 c in the rainy season and 20 3 5 43 c in the dry season respectively the annual average temperature varied from 14 8 c to 21 9 c the long term annual mean precipitation varies within 560 96 1081 6 mm and the annul evaporation is approximately 1613 4 mm the annual runoff is 7 7 108 m3 y at xiaohuangguayuan station the basic topography is dominated by 95 of hills and mountains in this region the main rock types comprise the limestone carbonates sandstone quartz and felspar shale quartz and calcite and basalt siliciclastic rocks the downstream yuanmou county belongs to the typical dry hot valley region which leads to the severe soil erosion and fragile ecosystem in this watershed 2 2 sample collection and measurement a total of 15 grab samples on the mainstem and 21 samples on the major tributaries were collected in september 2017 post wet period our fieldworks were performed in the forenoon from 9 00 am to 12 00 pm and afternoon from 14 00 pm to 18 00 pm which intended to minimize the influence from diurnal fluctuation light intensity and temperature shifts on the samples the sampling sites were selected to incorporate full spectrum of stream order the main stem and major tributaries and ensured a comprehensive representation for regional features campeau and del giorgio 2014 running surface water at a depth of 10 cm was taken and filtered through glass microfiber filters gf f 47 mm 0 7 μm whatman the filtrates were preserved in the high density polyethylene hdpe plastic containers 100 ml the laboratory analysis doc and spectroscopic measurements was conducted within 8 h and the bdoc incubation was immediately performed once the samples were transported to the laboratory the doc and dissolved inorganic carbon dic concentrations were determined by multi n c 2100s analytik jena germany the tdn and no3 n concentrations were determined by alkaline potassium persulfate digestion de borba et al 2014 the tdp concentrations were measured by ammonium molybdophosphate colorimetry lu et al 2011 and the nh4 n concentrations were measured using the salicylic acid spectrophotometry method yu wan et al 2014 the uv visible absorption at the wavelengths of 254 nm 250 nm 350 nm 365 nm 465 nm and 665 nm were measured using a double beam scanning spectrophotometer uv 5500pc shanghai the co2 in the headspace was detected by a gas chromatography flame ionization detector gc fid perkinelmer clarus 580 usa the stoichiometric ratios of doc tdn and tdp were calculated from molar concentration molality in particular doc tdp ratio generally dominated the energy transfer in aquatic ecosystems hessen 2006 and was defined as the molar ratio of doc to the tdp doc tdn and tdn tdp ratios were calculated using doc molality divided by tdn molality and tdn molality divided by tdp molality respectively thus the uncertainties of stoichiometric ratios were attributed to doc tdn and tdp mass concentrations while we showed good quality of c and nutrients data the dark bdoc incubation was conducted at the temperatures of 20 c and 30 c for 56 days in order to simulate the seasonal temperature variations the inoculation was not used in this study because most microbes could pass through the 0 7 μm filters mao et al 2016 we placed 50 ml filtered water in 150 ml glass bottle three bottles per water sample and two bottles of ultrapure water as blanks for each sample and capped with teflon lined stoppers and crimp seals the initial concentration of dic was determined at least 3 times and the outliers were picked out on day 7 14 28 42 and 56 20 ml headspace gas was collected in a gas sampling bag and immediately detected by gc fid the bottles were introduced into fresh air for 10 min after gas sampling and then sealed by the end of bdoc incubations final dic concentration in each bottle was measured the co2 production in the headspace was calculated by the differences between water samples and the blanks the total co2 production was quantified as the differences of initial dic finial dic and the cumulative headspace co2 production the biodegradation bdoc and the temperature sensitivity of bdoc q10 were expressed using the formula 1 and 2 as follows 1 bdoc total co 2 c production initial doc c 100 2 q 10 b d o c 30 b d o c 20 10 30 20 where bdoc20 and bdoc30 refer to bdoc at the temperatures of 20 c and 30 c respectively 2 3 quality control the bdoc incubation method was similar to that described by wickland et al 2012 and the chemical analysis of water samples followed the standard procedures that proposed by the american public health association 1985 the measuring of no3 n nh4 n tdn and tdp was replicated at least twice or more the outliers were picked out and the average readings were recorded until the coefficient of variance cv was below 3 or the uncertainties of absorbance were within 0 005 units the water samples for ultraviolet visible spectroscopic measurements were analyzed in duplicates or more the outliers were picked out and the average readings were recorded until the cv of a254 a350 e2 e3 and e4 e6 values were below 2 the description and calculation of dom optical parameters are listed in table s1 for gc fid determination the standard co2 gas was repeatedly determined until the cv was below 3 and each gas sample in the headspace was determined in duplicates cv 3 the dic and doc concentrations were determined in triplicate cv 2 the outliers were picked out and the average of readings was record previous observations suggested that bdoc was degraded in short turnover times ranging from hours to a few days which could result in some uncertainties of bdoc incubations vonk et al 2015 our water samples were preserved at a low temperature 4 c and the bdoc incubation was carried out once the samples were transported to the laboratory which could have minor influences on doc quantity and dom optical properties mao and li 2019 according to the river continuum concept vannote et al 1980 the sampling time could be regarded as a negligible factor of environmental variables in this study besides the mean concentrations of dic and doc were respectively 25 2 mg l and 4 93 mg l which may lead to an uncertainty of 10 for bdoc due to the systematic error cv 2 in instrumental analysis 2 4 statistical analyses kolmogorov smirnov and levene s tests were used for tests of data normality and homogeneity respectively the natural log transform was not performed because the data in this study obey a normal distribution p 0 05 the relationships between bdoc dom optical parameters a254 a350 e2 e3 and e4 e6 and stoichiometric c n p ratio were examined using simple linear regressions the significant correlations were defined when p values were below 0 05 the mann whitney u test was employed to test the differences of bdoc nutrients and dom optical parameters the significant differences were determined when p values were below 0 05 all statistical analyses were performed using spss statistical package 19 0 all the figures were prepared using sigmaplot 11 0 and originlab originpro 2017 3 results a summary of initial trophic status q10 values and bdoc in the longchuan river are shown in table 1 and fig 2 the doc concentration ranged from 2 41 to 8 62 mg l with an average of 5 1 5 mg l the nh4 n and no3 n concentrations were 0 2 0 4 and 1 1 0 9 mg l respectively there were more than tenfold variations in the stoichiometric ratio of doc tdn ranging 0 51 9 12 doc tdp ranging 56 1 443 1 and tdn tdp ratios ranging 21 9 745 0 molar ratios on average the mean values of nutrient stoichiometric ratios were 4 1 9 doc tdn 204 94 3 doc tdp and 82 118 1 tdn tdp respectively the bdoc levels were within 3 5 79 7 mean value 34 19 9 at 20 c and 19 4 85 2 mean value 52 19 8 at 30 c fig 2 the q10 values averaged 2 1 7 whereas the weak temperature sensitivity q10 1 was also observed in four samples q10 values were 0 9 table 1 the dom optical properties are deciphered in fig 3 the a254 and a350 values respectively represented the aromaticity and lignin fraction of dom in natural waters which significantly decreased p 0 001 after the bdoc incubations particularly the a254 values after incubations at 20 c 9 3 1 were significantly lower than that at 30 c 14 4 2 p 0 001 the e2 e3 and e4 e6 reflected the dom molecular size negative correlation in freshwaters after incubations at 30 c the e2 e3 values significantly increased from 5 2 7 to 7 2 9 whereas the e4 e6 values decreased from 2 2 0 3 to 1 9 0 4 p 0 05 4 discussion the bdoc averaged 34 19 9 at 20 c fig 2 this was slightly higher than previous studies in other tributaries of the yangtze river 25 8 0 of bdoc 56 day incubation at 20 c mao et al 2016 but was lower than that in the yukon river 35 53 of bdoc 28 day incubation at 15 c wickland et al 2012 in the longchuan river agricultural pollution and severe soil erosion resulted in high concentrations of nh4 n 0 2 0 4 mg l and no3 n 1 1 0 9 mg l table 1 thus the adequate nutrients and allochthonous young organic matter inputs might enhance the bdoc in this study furthermore the higher bdoc 52 19 8 was obtained after the incubations at 30 c with a q10 of 2 1 7 this was consistent with prior findings in mountainous subtropical rivers q10 2 0 0 3 mao and li 2018 and high latitude rivers q10 2 0 0 6 wickland et al 2012 indeed the elevated temperature 30 c favoured microbial growth and metabolic activity and further stimulated the respiration of doc brown et al 2004 the microbial community structure and activity play a dominant role in riverine biological process langworthy et al 1998 previous observations suggested that dom optical properties nutrients and their stoichiometric ratios were closely linked to microbial distribution patterns and further indicated the doc biodegradability in aquatic environments lin et al 2012 for example nh4 n was recognized to be the important nutrient that affected microbial community composition li et al 2013 ward et al 2007 and exhibited the positive correlation with bdoc in this study fig s1 the recalcitrant and labile doc could originate from distinct microbial communities wear et al 2015 and regional microbial species could be characterized by dom aromaticity and molecular size saadi et al 2006 which substantiated the high bdoc 79 7 at 20 c and 75 9 at 30 c and low a254 value 6 72 observed in the tributary ca nawusuan figs 2 and 3 meanwhile the variations of dom chemical composition also reflected the doc biodegradability saadi et al 2006 it is generally believed that bdoc would be preferentially biodegraded in natural waters moran et al 2000 pellerin et al 2010 the decreasing abundance of aromatic a254 values and lignin fraction a350 values in this study fig 3a suggested that the bdoc was largely decomposed and the recalcitrant fraction was also degraded after 56 day incubations this was in accordance with the previous findings in biodegradation of aromatic substance and lignin in natural waters hackett et al 1977 reardon et al 2002 and supported our high bdoc 34 19 9 at 20 c and 52 19 8 at 30 c consistent with our first hypothesis the increasing of e2 e3 fig 3b illustrated that the large molecular dom was biodegraded after the incubations which also evidenced the decreasing of bdoc in samples however the e4 e6 values decreased when it was employed for the incubation at a temperature of 30 c which suggested the increase of dom aromaticity helms et al 2008 these apparently conflicting observations indicated that the accumulation and incomplete degradation of recalcitrant doms coexisted in the incubation process and high temperature 30 c boosted the biodegradability of refractory fraction dicorcia et al 1994 which supported the c quality temperature hypothesis that the temperature sensitivity would increase with the increasing of substrate recalcitrance bosatta and agren 1999 according to the second hypothesis the microbial growth and activities were largely affected by the trophic levels which further led to regional variability of doc biodegradability lin et al 2012 our results indicated that bdoc was negatively correlated with the doc tdp ratio fig 4 this was similar to the findings in the other subtropical rivers mao et al 2016 but was inconsistent with some high latitude rivers abbott et al 2014 in fact the availability of nutrients affected the microbial productivity in aquatic ecosystems which controlled the c mineralization in different trophic status n or p limitation coble et al 2015 olsen et al 2002 previous studies indicated the dominant role of p availability of bdoc in subtropical regions mao and li 2019 which was supported by the high ratios of doc tdp 204 94 3 and tdn tdp 82 118 1 table 1 in this study and the significant linkages of bdoc doc tdp ratio fig 4c the fitting equations at 20 c bdoc 269 9e 0 008x p 0 05 and 30 c incubations bdoc 311 0e 0 01x p 0 05 also implied a consistent contribution on bdoc by p availability despite of the elevated temperature which also evidenced that trophic levels were the primary control in aquatic microbial respiration in the longchuan river nevertheless we did not observe the discernible relationships of bdoc tdn tdp ratio fig 4a and bdoc doc tdn ratio fig 4b although these correlations could be found in other regions mao et al 2016 wickland et al 2012 in fact the nutrient limitation generally dominated the microbial respiration in natural waters kragh et al 2008 and the p limited rivers were widely reported in the yangtze river basin muller et al 2012 yan and zhang 2003 the abnormal high tdn tdp ratio 82 118 1 table 1 also suggested the p limitation in the longchuan river this implied that bdoc should be slightly related to the variations of the excessive n loadings corroborated by the weak linkages with tdn tdp and doc tdn ratios p 0 05 moreover the severe soil erosion and thus soil flushing in the dry hot valley region could largely contribute to nutrient inputs weiler and mcdonnell 2006 this process not only masked the relationships between bdoc and n related stoichiometric ratios but also weakened the relationships of bdoc doc tdp ratio low r2 0 30 for 20 c incubations and r2 0 23 for 30 c incubations due to the interplays of c n p stoichiometry mao et al 2017 besides gully erosion increased the terrestrially derived sediment inputs zhu et al 2008 and the sediment microorganisms greatly biodegraded the aquatic doc in natural waters johnson et al 2012 therefore the contributions of sediment microorganisms on doc mineralization should be called for caution when estimating the in situ doc biodegradability in aquatic systems in summary the bdoc averaged 34 19 9 at 20 c and 52 19 8 at 30 c with a mean q10 value of 2 1 7 in the longchuan river which was mediated by the dom chemical composition and trophic status the a254 a350 and e4 e6 values decreased but the e2 e3 values increased after 56 day incubations which illustrated the bdoc was largely decomposed and large molecular doms aromatic and lignin fractions were incompletely biodegraded and accumulated we observed the linkages between bdoc and doc tdp ratio which highlighted that trophic levels controlled the microbial respiration in the aquatic environment and the p availability was a dominant driver on doc biodegradability it is our hope that this study will provide the available information on aquatic respiration

normal distribution p 0 05 the relationships between bdoc dom optical parameters a254 a350 e2 e3 and e4 e6 and stoichiometric c n p ratio were examined using simple linear regressions the significant correlations were defined when p values were below 0 05 the mann whitney u test was employed to test the differences of bdoc nutrients and dom optical parameters the significant differences were determined when p values were below 0 05 all statistical analyses were performed using spss statistical package 19 0 all the figures were prepared using sigmaplot 11 0 and originlab originpro 2017 3 results a summary of initial trophic status q10 values and bdoc in the longchuan river are shown in table 1 and fig 2 the doc concentration ranged from 2 41 to 8 62 mg l with an average of 5 1 5 mg l the nh4 n and no3 n concentrations were 0 2 0 4 and 1 1 0 9 mg l respectively there were more than tenfold variations in the stoichiometric ratio of doc tdn ranging 0 51 9 12 doc tdp ranging 56 1 443 1 and tdn tdp ratios ranging 21 9 745 0 molar ratios on average the mean values of nutrient stoichiometric ratios were 4 1 9 doc tdn 204 94 3 doc tdp and 82 118 1 tdn tdp respectively the bdoc levels were within 3 5 79 7 mean value 34 19 9 at 20 c and 19 4 85 2 mean value 52 19 8 at 30 c fig 2 the q10 values averaged 2 1 7 whereas the weak temperature sensitivity q10 1 was also observed in four samples q10 values were 0 9 table 1 the dom optical properties are deciphered in fig 3 the a254 and a350 values respectively represented the aromaticity and lignin fraction of dom in natural waters which significantly decreased p 0 001 after the bdoc incubations particularly the a254 values after incubations at 20 c 9 3 1 were significantly lower than that at 30 c 14 4 2 p 0 001 the e2 e3 and e4 e6 reflected the dom molecular size negative correlation in freshwaters after incubations at 30 c the e2 e3 values significantly increased from 5 2 7 to 7 2 9 whereas the e4 e6 values decreased from 2 2 0 3 to 1 9 0 4 p 0 05 4 discussion the bdoc averaged 34 19 9 at 20 c fig 2 this was slightly higher than previous studies in other tributaries of the yangtze river 25 8 0 of bdoc 56 day incubation at 20 c mao et al 2016 but was lower than that in the yukon river 35 53 of bdoc 28 day incubation at 15 c wickland et al 2012 in the longchuan river agricultural pollution and severe soil erosion resulted in high concentrations of nh4 n 0 2 0 4 mg l and no3 n 1 1 0 9 mg l table 1 thus the adequate nutrients and allochthonous young organic matter inputs might enhance the bdoc in this study furthermore the higher bdoc 52 19 8 was obtained after the incubations at 30 c with a q10 of 2 1 7 this was consistent with prior findings in mountainous subtropical rivers q10 2 0 0 3 mao and li 2018 and high latitude rivers q10 2 0 0 6 wickland et al 2012 indeed the elevated temperature 30 c favoured microbial growth and metabolic activity and further stimulated the respiration of doc brown et al 2004 the microbial community structure and activity play a dominant role in riverine biological process langworthy et al 1998 previous observations suggested that dom optical properties nutrients and their stoichiometric ratios were closely linked to microbial distribution patterns and further indicated the doc biodegradability in aquatic environments lin et al 2012 for example nh4 n was recognized to be the important nutrient that affected microbial community composition li et al 2013 ward et al 2007 and exhibited the positive correlation with bdoc in this study fig s1 the recalcitrant and labile doc could originate from distinct microbial communities wear et al 2015 and regional microbial species could be characterized by dom aromaticity and molecular size saadi et al 2006 which substantiated the high bdoc 79 7 at 20 c and 75 9 at 30 c and low a254 value 6 72 observed in the tributary ca nawusuan figs 2 and 3 meanwhile the variations of dom chemical composition also reflected the doc biodegradability saadi et al 2006 it is generally believed that bdoc would be preferentially biodegraded in natural waters moran et al 2000 pellerin et al 2010 the decreasing abundance of aromatic a254 values and lignin fraction a350 values in this study fig 3a suggested that the bdoc was largely decomposed and the recalcitrant fraction was also degraded after 56 day incubations this was in accordance with the previous findings in biodegradation of aromatic substance and lignin in natural waters hackett et al 1977 reardon et al 2002 and supported our high bdoc 34 19 9 at 20 c and 52 19 8 at 30 c consistent with our first hypothesis the increasing of e2 e3 fig 3b illustrated that the large molecular dom was biodegraded after the incubations which also evidenced the decreasing of bdoc in samples however the e4 e6 values decreased when it was employed for the incubation at a temperature of 30 c which suggested the increase of dom aromaticity helms et al 2008 these apparently conflicting observations indicated that the accumulation and incomplete degradation of recalcitrant doms coexisted in the incubation process and high temperature 30 c boosted the biodegradability of refractory fraction dicorcia et al 1994 which supported the c quality temperature hypothesis that the temperature sensitivity would increase with the increasing of substrate recalcitrance bosatta and agren 1999 according to the second hypothesis the microbial growth and activities were largely affected by the trophic levels which further led to regional variability of doc biodegradability lin et al 2012 our results indicated that bdoc was negatively correlated with the doc tdp ratio fig 4 this was similar to the findings in the other subtropical rivers mao et al 2016 but was inconsistent with some high latitude rivers abbott et al 2014 in fact the availability of nutrients affected the microbial productivity in aquatic ecosystems which controlled the c mineralization in different trophic status n or p limitation coble et al 2015 olsen et al 2002 previous studies indicated the dominant role of p availability of bdoc in subtropical regions mao and li 2019 which was supported by the high ratios of doc tdp 204 94 3 and tdn tdp 82 118 1 table 1 in this study and the significant linkages of bdoc doc tdp ratio fig 4c the fitting equations at 20 c bdoc 269 9e 0 008x p 0 05 and 30 c incubations bdoc 311 0e 0 01x p 0 05 also implied a consistent contribution on bdoc by p availability despite of the elevated temperature which also evidenced that trophic levels were the primary control in aquatic microbial respiration in the longchuan river nevertheless we did not observe the discernible relationships of bdoc tdn tdp ratio fig 4a and bdoc doc tdn ratio fig 4b although these correlations could be found in other regions mao et al 2016 wickland et al 2012 in fact the nutrient limitation generally dominated the microbial respiration in natural waters kragh et al 2008 and the p limited rivers were widely reported in the yangtze river basin muller et al 2012 yan and zhang 2003 the abnormal high tdn tdp ratio 82 118 1 table 1 also suggested the p limitation in the longchuan river this implied that bdoc should be slightly related to the variations of the excessive n loadings corroborated by the weak linkages with tdn tdp and doc tdn ratios p 0 05 moreover the severe soil erosion and thus soil flushing in the dry hot valley region could largely contribute to nutrient inputs weiler and mcdonnell 2006 this process not only masked the relationships between bdoc and n related stoichiometric ratios but also weakened the relationships of bdoc doc tdp ratio low r2 0 30 for 20 c incubations and r2 0 23 for 30 c incubations due to the interplays of c n p stoichiometry mao et al 2017 besides gully erosion increased the terrestrially derived sediment inputs zhu et al 2008 and the sediment microorganisms greatly biodegraded the aquatic doc in natural waters johnson et al 2012 therefore the contributions of sediment microorganisms on doc mineralization should be called for caution when estimating the in situ doc biodegradability in aquatic systems in summary the bdoc averaged 34 19 9 at 20 c and 52 19 8 at 30 c with a mean q10 value of 2 1 7 in the longchuan river which was mediated by the dom chemical composition and trophic status the a254 a350 and e4 e6 values decreased but the e2 e3 values increased after 56 day incubations which illustrated the bdoc was largely decomposed and large molecular doms aromatic and lignin fractions were incompletely biodegraded and accumulated we observed the linkages between bdoc and doc tdp ratio which highlighted that trophic levels controlled the microbial respiration in the aquatic environment and the p availability was a dominant driver on doc biodegradability it is our hope that this study will provide the available information on aquatic respiration

aquifers subjecting to river level fluctuations barlow et al 2000 moench and barlow 2000 sedghi and zhan 2016 serrano and workman 1998 singh et al 2018 sophocleous 2002 workman et al 1997 these fluctuations serve as natural stresses to aquifers of concern response of aquifers to theses stresses or controlled stream stage variations can be used to estimate the hydraulic parameters of aquifers if a proper mathematical model can be established between the stresses and aquifers bolster et al 2001 rötting et al 2006 these methods are less expensive that the pumping test among other benefits trefry and bekele 2004 groundwater dynamics in such aquifers can be used to estimate aquifer hydraulic parameters using appropriate mathematical models and their associated analytical solutions assumptions that are made to obtain such solutions limit their application in real field situations therefore eliminating some of those limiting assumptions to make the solutions applicable for more realistic situations becomes indispensable for better estimate of aquifer parameters one of these limiting assumptions is ignoring time varying recharge to aquifers recharge serves as a natural stress to river basin barlow et al 2000 singh et al 2018 as well as other aquifers for instance gandak basin of india is subjected to river level fluctuation due to monsoon and areal recharge and is modeled using modflow by singh et al 2018 the groundwater level of extremely conductive biscayne limestone aquifer of southeast florida is affected by river level variation and recharge due to rainfall as reported by bolster et al 2001 who used analytical model presented by zlotnik and huang 1999 to estimate the specific yield of the aquifer bolster et al 2001 did not consider the areal recharge in their work blackstone river stream aquifer system massachusetts is another example barlow et al 2000 areal recharge was not implemented as a boundary condition to the model as used by barlow et al 2000 instead barlow et al 2000 calculate areal recharge by dividing the groundwater rise by the specific yield in this study we eliminate this assumption and consider general recharge function in the analytical model of groundwater head variations due to stream fluctuations the stream aquifer interaction has been the subject of many investigations by hydrogeologist intaraprasong and zhan 2009 these investigations are fallen into two categories in many of these studies the stream depletion rate and drawdown due to pumping from a nearby well were explored sedghi et al 2012 sun and zhan 2007 yeh et al 2008 zlotnik 2004 in other researches the hydraulic responses of river basin aquifers to stream stage variations were investigated akylas and koussis 2007 bansal 2012 barlow et al 2000 cooper and rorabaugh 1963 hall and moench 1972 haushild and kruse 1962 jiang and tang 2015 moench and barlow 2000 sedghi and zhan 2016 yeh 1970 sinusoidal function was considered by cooper and rorabaugh 1963 to simulate the stream stage fluctuation instant change in stream stage was considered in other researches akylas and koussis 2007 haushild and kruse 1962 yeh 1970 discrete time hydrograph barlow et al 2000 hantush 2005 moench and barlow 2000 uniform rate stage rising bansal 2012 and exponentially decaying stream stage bansal 2013 were considered in other works general approximate jiang and tang 2015 and exact sedghi and zhan 2016 function were also considered to simulate stream stage fluctuations the presented work is fallen into the second category to our knowledge there is no analytical solution of this category considering general river level variations and general recharge function the effects of natural and artificial recharge on groundwater head variation or groundwater mound have received attention in many researches the growth and decay of groundwater mound due to uniform recharge from an infinite strip was investigated by marino 1974 the dupuit forchheimer assumptions were adopted by amar 1975 to investigate the effects of recharge from an infinite strip comparing results with experimental data amar 1975 concluded that the dupuit forchheimer theory was valid for relatively small water table rises dupuit forchheimer assumptions were also adopted in many researches concerning groundwater recharge simulation anderson 1976 brock 1976 manglik et al 2004 rai and singh 1995 singh and jacob 1977 verhoest and troch 2000 constant recharge from a circular basin to a perched aquifer was considered by brock 1976 in above mentioned solutions uniform recharge in an infinite strip basin was considered and the aquifer was bounded by a constant head boundary periodic step functions were used by singh and jacob 1977 to simulate areal recharge they utilized linearized boussinesq equation to obtain their solution the model domain was bounded by constant head boundaries aquifer domain bounded by cauchy boundary condition subjected to periodic recharge was considered by latinopoulos 1986 using exponential decaying rai and singh 1995 and piecewise linear functions manglik et al 2004 were not uncommon to simulate groundwater recharge zlotnik and ledder 1993 utilized the first order free surface equation with a source term representing recharge to simulate the water table boundary condition the same method was followed by chang et al 2016 to simulate the water table boundary condition to obtain three dimensional 3d time domain solution of groundwater head in a rectangular aquifer with the robin type lateral boundaries they also presented a fairly intensive review on analytical solutions concerning groundwater recharge to our knowledge there is no analytical model considering general time varying recharge and time varying lateral boundaries head variations this model set up is not uncommon in field situations in river basin aquifers rainfall causes the river water level rise due to the surface runoff and recharge to the aquifer from its top boundary elongated fractured anticlines replenished by rainfall or snowmelt and recharge from their adjacent alluvial aquifers the presented solution can be used to determine the hydrodynamic parameters of 1 groundwater head variation of a river basin aquifer subjected to general time dependent lateral head variation and recharge 2 groundwater head variation in a double porosity elongated fractured aquifer i e an anticline with length higher than its width so that the groundwater flow is always along its width this type of anticline is quite common in folding belts ashjari and raeisi 2006 3 groundwater depletion of an elongated anticline subjected to recharge due to rainfall or snowmelt to its adjacent alluvial aquifer furthermore the presented solution can be used to optimize the irrigation amount and pattern in a cropland between two trench drains to control the groundwater mound to sum up the presented analytical model is applicable to many river aquifer systems where there is no point source or sinks 2 conceptual and mathematical models the schematic cross section of the aquifer domain is illustrated in fig 1 the unconfined aquifer with the impermeable boundary at the bottom and the instantaneously drainable water table and areal recharge chang et al 2016 zlotnik and ledder 1993 at the top of aquifer are considered general time dependent functions can be considered to simulate the areal recharge two parallel boundaries with general head variations bound the aquifer laterally sedghi and zhan 2016 a two dimensional 2d cartesian system is considered for the aquifer model the origin is set at the intersection of the left hand side boundary and the initial water table and the z axis is positive upward the x axis is horizontal and positive rightward the mathematical model is described as follows the following partial differential equation governs the groundwater head in the unconfined aquifer 1 k x 2 h x 2 k z 2 h z 2 s s h t 0 where h is the hydraulic head l k x and k z are the horizontal and vertical hydraulic conductivities lt 1 respectively s s is the specific storage l 1 and t is time t a number of points are notable about eq 1 first this equation is a 2d version of a more general 3d transient groundwater flow equation as used before by others e g zhan and zlotnik 2002 when the hydraulic head is independent of the coordinate along the y axis or the axis perpendicular to the xz plane this equation is simply a statement of mass conservation and it does not involve any linearization process which may be invoked when eq 1 is further simplified to the one dimensional 1d boussinesq equation as evident in eq 1 both horizontal and vertical flows are honored second the aquifer is assumed to be homogeneous and anisotropic the use of homogeneity assumption is for the purpose of analytical treatment if the aquifer is heterogeneous eq 1 will be modified slightly to reflect the spatial dependence of hydraulic conductivity terms and a numerical approach is often required third the unconfined nature of flow will be expressed with a proper form of the free surface water table condition will be discussed later which serves as the upper boundary of the saturated flow this also implies that the complex unsaturated saturated flow process has been simplified in a way that the influence of the unsaturated zone on the flow dynamics can be represented with the use of a free water table condition eq 1 is solved subject to the following initial and boundary conditions the horizontal zero head initial condition is considered as 2 h x z 0 0 general time dependent functions are used to simulate lateral boundary head variations as 3 h 0 z t f 1 t 4 h l x z t f 2 t where lx is the dimension of the aquifer along the x axis no flow condition is considered at the bottom of aquifer as 5 h z z d 0 where d is the initial saturated thickness of the unconfined aquifer the following equation describing the water table response to recharge is used as the boundary condition at the top of the unconfined aquifer chang et al 2016 zlotnik and ledder 1993 6 k z h z x 0 t s y h t f x r t where s y is the specific yield of the unconfined aquifer r t and f x are functions governing the temporal and spatial variations of recharge at the top of aquifer respectively 3 analytical solution the laplace domain solution to eq 1 with respect to initial and boundary conditions of eqs 2 5 is obtained following the same method presented by sedghi and zhan 2016 as h d 2 l xd m 1 α r d p cosh λ z d 1 λ sinh λ ξ p cosh λ

and 10 for the two last right hand terms in eq 8 11 γ n n π l xd 2 the above solution eq 6 is general and can be utilized to obtain special case solving the convolutional integrals considering time varying recharge and lateral boundaries head variations the details of residue theorem and convolutional integrals used in this section are shown in supplementary materials 4 applications in this section some applications of the presented general solution in field conditions are presented to prepare curves in this section default parameters values given in table 2 are used such values of default parameters have been employed in other studies as well sedghi and zhan 2016 it should be noted that the lengths used to transform head to its dimensionless form are different in these cases as the functions governing lateral boundaries are different for different cases see table 1 4 1 river level fluctuation and areal recharge periodic functions are considered to simulate head fluctuations of lateral boundaries therefore the boundary conditions of eqs 3 4 are 12 f 1 d 0 z d t d cos ω 1 t d 13 f 2 d l x z d t d a 2 a 1 cos ω 2 t d where ω 1 and ω 2 are dimensionless frequencies and a 1 and a 2 are amplitudes of river level fluctuations it should be noted that above equations are normalized by the amplitude of river level fluctuations in left hand side boundary a 1 the constant recharge is considered as 14 r τ i 0 d considering the above boundary conditions eq 8 becomes 15 h td 2 l xd n 1 m 1 α sin β m x d cosh λ n z d 1 sinh λ n λ n 1 2 ξ p n 2 cosh λ n 1 2 ξ i 0 d exp p n

using the default parameters presented by huang et al 2012 in well sorted unconsolidated aquifers these values may be common in volcanic rocks of coastal or island aquifers e g hawaii hydraulic conductivity up to 280 m d is reported rotzoll et al 2008 the results are shown in fig 2 the figure shows satisfactory agreement between the proposed solution with that of huang et al 2012 except for early times when the initial condition affects the dimensionless drawdown memory time li et al 2000 in fact the zero head initial condition is considered for general solution obtained in this work eq 2 for the case with stream fluctuations in lateral boundaries before the start of simulation it takes time to diminish the effects of initial conditions from the calculated drawdown this time lag is called memory time and discussed in li et al 2000 inspecting eq 16 reveals that the memory time is controlled by the exponential term in that equation as pn is negative this term diminished over time at the rate that is depends on pn please see supplementary materials to confirm this finding the exponential term is eliminated from eq 16 and results are shown in fig 2 red markers as expected the early time discrepancy disappears and the proposed solution follows that of huang et al 2012 from early to late times analyzing the exponential term in eq 16 shows that increasing the specific yield sy increases the memory time it should be noted that the memory time is stated to depend only on frequency of fluctuations and is not affected by the aquifer hydraulic parameters li et al 2000 in this work for the first time we present a mathematical explanation of the memory time the huang et al 2012 solution was proposed for tidal fluctuations and we compare our solution with their solution for the sake of verification to illustrate the effects of areal recharge on groundwater dynamics due to river level fluctuations with a period of 4 days fig 3 is prepared an observation point 150 m away from the river is considered and other parameters are set to default values table 2 inspecting fig 3 shows that groundwater head fluctuates with a rising trend this trend is proportional with the recharge rate a closer look at the figure reveals that the amplitude of fluctuations decreases over time due to the cumulative effects of recharge this however do not affect the times when groundwater peaks take place i e lag times thus one can use lag time data of the groundwater head fluctuations to calculate hydraulic parameters of river basin aquifers using analytical models in which the areal recharge are not considered on the other hand if one wants to estimate the groundwater recharge rate or use groundwater head or attenuation data to estimate aquifer hydraulic parameters the proposed solution should be used 4 2 constant head boundaries and areal recharge to test the effects of areal recharge on aquifer head distribution the lateral boundary head variation is eliminated and the zero head lateral boundaries are considered the following function chang et al 2016 is considered to simulate the areal recharge to aquifer as 18 r d t i 1 d i 0 d exp ε d t d where i 1 d i 0 d is the

in eq 17 a modflow simulation is performed to compare the results with eq 19 the 50 500 cross section grid with 1 m by 1 m cells size is considered for modflow simulation the simulation time is divided into 50 equal stress periods each of which lasts 1 h and contains 100 time steps figs 4 and 5 show that the spatiotemporal head variations simulated by the proposed model agree well with the results obtained by modflow the very limited discrepancies at early time between the results of the analytical and the numerical model are probably due to the discretization error this error increases where high spatiotemporal head change exists this is reported in other works as well samani et al 2004 we further compare the proposed solution with modflow fig 6 using the following function to simulate the recharge from a strip basin located from x 0 d to x 1 d during the dimensionless time from t ad to t bd 20 h rd 2 l xd n 1 m 1 α sin β m x d cosh λ n z d 1 sinh λ n λ n 1 2 ξ p n 2 cosh λ

be noted that our analytical model simulates heads in desired locations used to prepare fig 6 in only 20 s the modflow model run however lasts more than 18 min the computational time is very important especially when the parameter estimation is proposed that needs many calls of forward model 4 3 water level hydrograph and step function recharge to simulate recharge the following step function in

of recharge h is the heaviside step function as stated before general functions can be used to simulate lateral boundaries in a river basin aquifer the function governing the stream level change the water level hydrograph can be used to simulate lateral boundaries the rising or falling limb of the hydrograph follows an exponential function as suggested by teloglou and bansal 2012 24 h y t h 2 h 2 h 1 exp α 1 t where hy t is the time dependent water level of the stream h 1 and h2 are the initial and final heights of the stream level respectively α 1 is a positive constant showing the rate of

and 25 respectively eq 29 is used to construct fig 7 the stream stage hydrograph parameters introduced in table 2 are used to prepare the figure as the attenuation length of the boundary head fluctuations la depends on the angular frequency of the head fluctuations ω among other factors huang et al 2012 teo et al 2003 the damping of the stream stage hydrograph is not significant in the aquifer as it is a single peak function with a very low angular frequency 32 l a 2 k x d s y ω 1 therefore the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer is reduced by an order of magnitude to better illustrate the response of the aquifer to stream stage variations comparing black curves the case with no areal recharge and blue curves the case with areal recharge of 10 7 ms 1 shows the effects of areal recharge on the aquifer head fluctuations as expected increasing the distance from the boundary increases the effects of recharge on the aquifer head owing to the fact that the recharged water is more easily and quickly depleted to the aquifer boundaries near them 4 4 elongated fractured anticline and strip recharge the same procedure as in sedghi and zhan 2016 can be followed to show that eq 7 can be modified to simulate the head variation in an elongated fractured aquifer e g fractured anticline considering the double porosity concept barenblatt et al 1960 it should be noted that the spherical block matrix is considered to model the inter porosity flow deruyck et al 1982 sedghi and zhan 2016 33 h fd 2 l xd m 1 α r d p cosh λ f z d 1 λ f sinh λ f ξ p cosh λ f sin β m x d 2 l xd m 1

dimensionless distances from the left and right hand side boundaries showing the dimension of a strip recharge basin for example due to snowmelt t ad and t bd are respectively the dimensionless times

figure eq 33 is used due to complexity of this equation inverse laplace transformation is performed numerically using the de hoog algorithm de hoog et al 1982 the dimensional boundary stream depletion

conductivities of fractures respectively the effects of recharge location on the boundary depletion rate are illustrated in fig 9 single porosity cases blue lines are compared with double porosity ones black lines as expected increasing the distance of recharge location from the left hand side boundary decreases the boundary depletion rate and increases the time lag between the times of recharge and the depletion rate furthermore comparing double porosity and single porosity curves reveals that sdr is lower during the rising limb and higher during the falling limb for the double porosity case this is due to storing of water in matrix blocks during the rising limb and releasing of water from them during the falling limb we further investigate the effects of hydraulic parameters on sdr using default parameters values table 2 and decreasing vertical and horizontal hydraulic conductivity values by an order of magnitude the results are presented in figs 10 12 to test the effects of vertical hydraulic conductivity of the fractures kzf fig 10 is constructed as shown in this figure increasing kzf increases the amplitude of sdr peak the explanation for this is that as kzf increases the vertical component of flow becomes more important this increases the hydraulic head chang et al 2016 and sdr of the aquifer the effects of kxf on sdr are illustrated in fig 11 increasing kxf increases the aquifer diffusivity therefore amplitude phase lag of sdr is proportional inversely proportional with kxf due to the same reason the amplitude and the phase lag of sdr is inversely proportional and proportional with the specific yield sy fig 12 and the specific storage of the matrix block ssm figure not shown respectively 4 5 aquifer parameter estimation to show the application of the presented solution in the hydraulic parameter estimation of an elongated aquifer bounded by two parallel rivers two synthetic test cases are performed default parameter values introduced in table 2 are used the period of the head fluctuations are set to 0 5 day constant recharge with the rate of 5 10 7 m s 1 is considered the head is simulated in an observation point 150 m away from either river at the depth of 5 m below the initial water table head is calculated every 1 h for 50 h the calculated head is considered as the head observation and the analytical model programmed in fortran is linked to ucode poeter and hill 1999 to estimate the aquifer parameters we reduce the optimal parameter values by an order of magnitude and set them as initial parameter values and then run ucode to test if it can estimate the optimal parameter values using calculated head as observations unfortunately the ucode could not estimate true parameter values and extreme parameter correlation correlation more than 0 95 occurs table 3 this shows that the model suffers from non uniqueness hill and tiedeman 2006 we freeze the recharge on its optimal value and run ucode to estimate other hydraulic parameters the parameter correlation is significantly decreases table 4 and ucode can estimate the parameters values nicely the effects of the recharge on the extreme parameter correlation is also discussed by a few previous investigators hill and tiedeman 2006 finally we freeze all hydraulic parameters on their optimal values and allow ucode to estimate the recharge the parameter estimation model can estimate accurate recharge value we repeat the synthetic test case using the head calculated at the deep piezometer at the depth of 45 m below the initial water table the same results are obtained with slightly higher parameter correlation this higher correlation is due to the fact that heads of the deeper piezometer are less sensitive to vertical hydraulic conductivity specific yield and recharge we repeat the simulation and parameter estimation by increasing the period of the head fluctuation of the lateral boundaries to 2 days the same results obtained with higher parameter correlation results not presented to sum up these test cases show that simultaneous estimation of recharge and hydraulic parameters of the coastal aquifer cause extreme parameter correlation and should be avoided it is recommended that the hydraulic parameters should be estimated using head data of dry periods when recharge is absent then the head data collected during the wet or recharge period can be used to estimate recharge value when other hydraulic parameters freeze on their optimal value calculated using head data of dry or no recharge period it should be noted that increasing the period of the lateral boundaries head fluctuation increases the chance of extreme parameter correlation that reduce the model uniqueness 5 summary and conclusion the time domain solutions of groundwater head fluctuation in an elongated aquifer due to general time dependent lateral boundary head and recharge fluctuations are presented in this work we also present laplace domain solution of above problem for the double porosity case the solution is obtained via laplace and fourier transformations first followed by an inverse transform process to time domain following the residue theorem and convolutional integral for the single porosity cases the following applications of the presented solution are presented among others 1 analytical solution of the head fluctuation in an elongated aquifer bounded by two parallel rivers is obtained when eliminating recharge from the solution and considering cosine functions governing head fluctuations in lateral boundaries the effects of hydraulic parameters on memory time are investigated 2 eliminating lateral boundaries head fluctuations the effects of exponentially decaying recharge and constant recharge in a strip basin are investigated and the temporal and spatial head variations calculated using the proposed model are tested against the modflow model 3 considering the stream stage hydrograph including both rising and falling limbs along with areal recharge during the specified period of time the head fluctuations in a river basin aquifer is presented 4 the laplace domain solution of head fluctuation in an elongated double porosity anticline subjected to areal recharge at a specified strip is obtained 5 the boundary depletion rate for the above mentioned setting is obtained and compared with the single porosity case the effects of hydraulic parameters of aquifer on boundary depletion rate are also tested this model is applicable when one wants to investigate the effects of the strip basin recharge e g due to snowmelt in a double porosity anticline reservoir on its depletion to the adjacent alluvial aquifer 6 it is recommended that the hydraulic parameters should be estimated using head data of dry periods when recharge is not occurred then the head data collected during the wet or recharge period can be used to estimate recharge value when other hydraulic parameters freeze on their optimal value calculated using head data of the dry no recharge period acknowledgement the first author wishes to thank payame noor university for financial

aquifers subjecting to river level fluctuations barlow et al 2000 moench and barlow 2000 sedghi and zhan 2016 serrano and workman 1998 singh et al 2018 sophocleous 2002 workman et al 1997 these fluctuations serve as natural stresses to aquifers of concern response of aquifers to theses stresses or controlled stream stage variations can be used to estimate the hydraulic parameters of aquifers if a proper mathematical model can be established between the stresses and aquifers bolster et al 2001 rötting et al 2006 these methods are less expensive that the pumping test among other benefits trefry and bekele 2004 groundwater dynamics in such aquifers can be used to estimate aquifer hydraulic parameters using appropriate mathematical models and their associated analytical solutions assumptions that are made to obtain such solutions limit their application in real field situations therefore eliminating some of those limiting assumptions to make the solutions applicable for more realistic situations becomes indispensable for better estimate of aquifer parameters one of these limiting assumptions is ignoring time varying recharge to aquifers recharge serves as a natural stress to river basin barlow et al 2000 singh et al 2018 as well as other aquifers for instance gandak basin of india is subjected to river level fluctuation due to monsoon and areal recharge and is modeled using modflow by singh et al 2018 the groundwater level of extremely conductive biscayne limestone aquifer of southeast florida is affected by river level variation and recharge due to rainfall as reported by bolster et al 2001 who used analytical model presented by zlotnik and huang 1999 to estimate the specific yield of the aquifer bolster et al 2001 did not consider the areal recharge in their work blackstone river stream aquifer system massachusetts is another example barlow et al 2000 areal recharge was not implemented as a boundary condition to the model as used by barlow et al 2000 instead barlow et al 2000 calculate areal recharge by dividing the groundwater rise by the specific yield in this study we eliminate this assumption and consider general recharge function in the analytical model of groundwater head variations due to stream fluctuations the stream aquifer interaction has been the subject of many investigations by hydrogeologist intaraprasong and zhan 2009 these investigations are fallen into two categories in many of these studies the stream depletion rate and drawdown due to pumping from a nearby well were explored sedghi et al 2012 sun and zhan 2007 yeh et al 2008 zlotnik 2004 in other researches the hydraulic responses of river basin aquifers to stream stage variations were investigated akylas and koussis 2007 bansal 2012 barlow et al 2000 cooper and rorabaugh 1963 hall and moench 1972 haushild and kruse 1962 jiang and tang 2015 moench and barlow 2000 sedghi and zhan 2016 yeh 1970 sinusoidal function was considered by cooper and rorabaugh 1963 to simulate the stream stage fluctuation instant change in stream stage was considered in other researches akylas and koussis 2007 haushild and kruse 1962 yeh 1970 discrete time hydrograph barlow et al 2000 hantush 2005 moench and barlow 2000 uniform rate stage rising bansal 2012 and exponentially decaying stream stage bansal 2013 were considered in other works general approximate jiang and tang 2015 and exact sedghi and zhan 2016 function were also considered to simulate stream stage fluctuations the presented work is fallen into the second category to our knowledge there is no analytical solution of this category considering general river level variations and general recharge function the effects of natural and artificial recharge on groundwater head variation or groundwater mound have received attention in many researches the growth and decay of groundwater mound due to uniform recharge from an infinite strip was investigated by marino 1974 the dupuit forchheimer assumptions were adopted by amar 1975 to investigate the effects of recharge from an infinite strip comparing results with experimental data amar 1975 concluded that the dupuit forchheimer theory was valid for relatively small water table rises dupuit forchheimer assumptions were also adopted in many researches concerning groundwater recharge simulation anderson 1976 brock 1976 manglik et al 2004 rai and singh 1995 singh and jacob 1977 verhoest and troch 2000 constant recharge from a circular basin to a perched aquifer was considered by brock 1976 in above mentioned solutions uniform recharge in an infinite strip basin was considered and the aquifer was bounded by a constant head boundary periodic step functions were used by singh and jacob 1977 to simulate areal recharge they utilized linearized boussinesq equation to obtain their solution the model domain was bounded by constant head boundaries aquifer domain bounded by cauchy boundary condition subjected to periodic recharge was considered by latinopoulos 1986 using exponential decaying rai and singh 1995 and piecewise linear functions manglik et al 2004 were not uncommon to simulate groundwater recharge zlotnik and ledder 1993 utilized the first order free surface equation with a source term representing recharge to simulate the water table boundary condition the same method was followed by chang et al 2016 to simulate the water table boundary condition to obtain three dimensional 3d time domain solution of groundwater head in a rectangular aquifer with the robin type lateral boundaries they also presented a fairly intensive review on analytical solutions concerning groundwater recharge to our knowledge there is no analytical model considering general time varying recharge and time varying lateral boundaries head variations this model set up is not uncommon in field situations in river basin aquifers rainfall causes the river water level rise due to the surface runoff and recharge to the aquifer from its top boundary elongated fractured anticlines replenished by rainfall or snowmelt and recharge from their adjacent alluvial aquifers the presented solution can be used to determine the hydrodynamic parameters of 1 groundwater head variation of a river basin aquifer subjected to general time dependent lateral head variation and recharge 2 groundwater head variation in a double porosity elongated fractured aquifer i e an anticline with length higher than its width so that the groundwater flow is always along its width this type of anticline is quite common in folding belts ashjari and raeisi 2006 3 groundwater depletion of an elongated anticline subjected to recharge due to rainfall or snowmelt to its adjacent alluvial aquifer furthermore the presented solution can be used to optimize the irrigation amount and pattern in a cropland between two trench drains to control the groundwater mound to sum up the presented analytical model is applicable to many river aquifer systems where there is no point source or sinks 2 conceptual and mathematical models the schematic cross section of the aquifer domain is illustrated in fig 1 the unconfined aquifer with the impermeable boundary at the bottom and the instantaneously drainable water table and areal recharge chang et al 2016 zlotnik and ledder 1993 at the top of aquifer are considered general time dependent functions can be considered to simulate the areal recharge two parallel boundaries with general head variations bound the aquifer laterally sedghi and zhan 2016 a two dimensional 2d cartesian system is considered for the aquifer model the origin is set at the intersection of the left hand side boundary and the initial water table and the z axis is positive upward the x axis is horizontal and positive rightward the mathematical model is described as follows the following partial differential equation governs the groundwater head in the unconfined aquifer 1 k x 2 h x 2 k z 2 h z 2 s s h t 0 where h is the hydraulic head l k x and k z are the horizontal and vertical hydraulic conductivities lt 1 respectively s s is the specific storage l 1 and t is time t a number of points are notable about eq 1 first this equation is a 2d version of a more general 3d transient groundwater flow equation as used before by others e g zhan and zlotnik 2002 when the hydraulic head is independent of the coordinate along the y axis or the axis perpendicular to the xz plane this equation is simply a statement of mass conservation and it does not involve any linearization process which may be invoked when eq 1 is further simplified to the one dimensional 1d boussinesq equation as evident in eq 1 both horizontal and vertical flows are honored second the aquifer is assumed to be homogeneous and anisotropic the use of homogeneity assumption is for the purpose of analytical treatment if the aquifer is heterogeneous eq 1 will be modified slightly to reflect the spatial dependence of hydraulic conductivity terms and a numerical approach is often required third the unconfined nature of flow will be expressed with a proper form of the free surface water table condition will be discussed later which serves as the upper boundary of the saturated flow this also implies that the complex unsaturated saturated flow process has been simplified in a way that the influence of the unsaturated zone on the flow dynamics can be represented with the use of a free water table condition eq 1 is solved subject to the following initial and boundary conditions the horizontal zero head initial condition is considered as 2 h x z 0 0 general time dependent functions are used to simulate lateral boundary head variations as 3 h 0 z t f 1 t 4 h l x z t f 2 t where lx is the dimension of the aquifer along the x axis no flow condition is considered at the bottom of aquifer as 5 h z z d 0 where d is the initial saturated thickness of the unconfined aquifer the following equation describing the water table response to recharge is used as the boundary condition at the top of the unconfined aquifer chang et al 2016 zlotnik and ledder 1993 6 k z h z x 0 t s y h t f x r t where s y is the specific yield of the unconfined aquifer r t and f x are functions governing the temporal and spatial variations of recharge at the top of aquifer respectively 3 analytical solution the laplace domain solution

section some applications of the presented general solution in field conditions are presented to prepare curves in this section default parameters values given in table 2 are used such values of default parameters have been employed in other studies as well sedghi and zhan 2016 it should be noted that the lengths used to transform head to its dimensionless form are different in these cases as the functions governing lateral boundaries are different for different cases see table 1 4 1 river level fluctuation and areal recharge periodic functions are considered to simulate head fluctuations of lateral boundaries therefore the boundary conditions of eqs 3 4 are 12 f 1 d 0 z d t d cos ω 1 t d 13 f 2 d l x z d t d a 2 a 1 cos ω 2 t d where ω 1 and ω 2 are dimensionless frequencies and a 1

using the default parameters presented by huang et al 2012 in well sorted unconsolidated aquifers these values may be common in volcanic rocks of coastal or island aquifers e g hawaii hydraulic conductivity up to 280 m d is reported rotzoll et al 2008 the results are shown in fig 2 the figure shows satisfactory agreement between the proposed solution with that of huang et al 2012 except for early times when the initial condition affects the dimensionless drawdown memory time li et al 2000 in fact the zero head initial condition is considered for general solution obtained in this work eq 2 for the case with stream fluctuations in lateral boundaries before the start of simulation it takes time to diminish the effects of initial conditions from the calculated drawdown this time lag is called memory time and discussed in li et al 2000 inspecting eq 16 reveals that the memory time is controlled by the exponential term in that equation as pn is negative this term diminished over time at the rate that is depends on pn please see supplementary materials to confirm this finding the exponential term is eliminated from eq 16 and results are shown in fig 2 red markers as expected the early time discrepancy disappears and the proposed solution follows that of huang et al 2012 from early to late times analyzing the exponential term in eq 16 shows that increasing the specific yield sy increases the memory time it should be noted that the memory time is stated to depend only on frequency of fluctuations and is not affected by the aquifer hydraulic parameters li et al 2000 in this work for the first time we present a mathematical explanation of the memory time the huang et al 2012 solution was proposed for tidal fluctuations and we compare our solution with their solution for the sake of verification to illustrate the effects of areal recharge on groundwater dynamics due to river level fluctuations with a period of 4 days fig 3 is prepared an observation point 150 m away from the river is considered and other parameters are set to default values table 2 inspecting fig 3 shows that groundwater head fluctuates with a rising trend this trend is proportional with the recharge rate a closer look at the figure reveals that the amplitude of fluctuations decreases over time due to the cumulative effects of recharge this however do not affect the times when groundwater peaks take place i e lag times thus one can use lag time data of the groundwater head fluctuations to calculate hydraulic parameters of river basin aquifers using analytical models in which the areal recharge are not considered on the other hand if one wants to estimate the groundwater recharge rate or use groundwater head or attenuation data to estimate aquifer hydraulic parameters the proposed solution should be used 4 2 constant head boundaries and areal recharge to test the effects of areal recharge on aquifer head distribution the lateral boundary head variation is eliminated and the zero head lateral boundaries are considered the following function chang et al 2016 is considered to simulate the areal recharge to aquifer as 18 r d t i 1 d i 0 d exp ε d t d where i 1 d i 0 d is the dimensionless initial recharge rate i 1 d is the final dimensionless recharge rate ε d is the dimensionless decay rate of the recharge all defined in table 1 considering the above mentioned boundary conditions eq 8 becomes 19 h rd 2 l xd n 1 m 1 α sin β m x d cosh λ n z d 1 sinh λ n λ n 1 2 ξ p n 2 cosh λ n 1 2 ξ i 1 d exp p n t 1 p n i 0 d exp p n t exp ε d t dp p n ε d where α is calculated as in eq 17 a modflow simulation is performed to compare the results with eq 19 the 50 500 cross section grid with 1 m by 1 m cells size is considered for modflow simulation the simulation time is divided into 50 equal stress periods each of which lasts 1 h and contains 100 time steps figs 4 and 5 show that the spatiotemporal head variations simulated by the proposed model agree well with the results obtained by modflow the very limited discrepancies at early time between the results of the analytical and the numerical model are probably due to the discretization error this error increases where high spatiotemporal head change exists this is reported in other works as well samani et al 2004 we further compare the proposed solution with modflow fig 6 using the following function to simulate the recharge from a strip basin located from x 0 d to x 1 d during the dimensionless time from t ad to t bd 20 h rd 2 l xd n 1 m 1 α sin β m x d cosh λ n z d 1 sinh λ n λ n 1 2 ξ p n 2 cosh λ

be noted that our analytical model simulates heads in desired locations used to prepare fig 6 in only 20 s the modflow model run however lasts more than 18 min the computational time is very important especially when the parameter estimation is proposed that needs many calls of forward model 4 3 water level hydrograph and step function recharge to simulate recharge the following step function in respect to time can be used 23 r d τ i 0 d h τ t ad h τ t bd where i 0 d is the dimensionless recharge t ad is the dimensionless time of the start of recharge t bd is the dimensionless time of the end of recharge h is the heaviside step function as stated before general functions can be used to simulate lateral boundaries in a river basin aquifer the function governing the stream level change the water level hydrograph can be used to simulate lateral boundaries the rising or falling limb of the hydrograph follows an exponential function as suggested by teloglou and bansal 2012 24 h y t h 2 h 2 h 1 exp α 1 t where hy t is the time dependent water level of the stream h 1 and h2 are the initial and final heights of the stream level respectively α 1 is a positive constant showing the rate of water level rising or falling eq 24 can be used to simulate the rising or falling limb of the water level hydrograph considering the above equation the whole water level hydrograph including both rising and falling limbs can be simulated as 25 h y d t d h pd exp α 1 d t d t 0 d h t d t 0 d h t d t 0 d t pd h 2 d a md exp α 2 d t d t 0 d t pd h t d t 0 d t pd where hpd is the dimensionless

surface water parcel to reach the basin outlet t 0 d is the starting time of flood hydrograph α 1 d and α 2 d are respectively the dimensionless rates of rising and falling of the hydrograph defined in table 1 amd is defined as 26 a md a m 2 a m 1 27 a m 1 h p h 1 28 a m 2 h 2 h p h p h 1 exp α 1 t t 0 t p where hp is the maximum water level of the stream for the case in which the duration of the rainfall is longer than the concentration time of the surface basin l h 1 and h 2 are the water levels before and after the flood l respectively am 1 and am 2 are the amplitudes of rising and falling limbs of the hydrograph respectively α 1 and α 2 are the rates of rising and falling of the hydrograph t 1 respectively considering eqs 23 and 25 eq 8 becomes 29 h hd 2 l xd n 1 m 1 α sin β m x d cosh

and 25 respectively eq 29 is used to construct fig 7 the stream stage hydrograph parameters introduced in table 2 are used to prepare the figure as the attenuation length of the boundary head fluctuations la depends on the angular frequency of the head fluctuations ω among other factors huang et al 2012 teo et al 2003 the damping of the stream stage hydrograph is not significant in the aquifer as it is a single peak function with a very low angular frequency 32 l a 2 k x d s y ω 1 therefore the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer is reduced by an order of magnitude to better illustrate the response of the aquifer to stream stage variations comparing black curves the case with no areal recharge and blue curves the case with areal recharge of 10 7 ms 1 shows the effects of areal recharge on the aquifer head fluctuations as expected increasing the distance from the boundary increases the effects of recharge on the aquifer head owing to the fact that the recharged water is more easily and quickly depleted to the aquifer boundaries near them 4 4 elongated fractured anticline and strip recharge the same procedure as in sedghi and zhan 2016 can be followed to show that eq 7 can be modified to simulate the head variation in an elongated fractured aquifer e g fractured anticline considering the double porosity concept barenblatt et al 1960 it should be noted that the

dimensionless distances from the left and right hand side boundaries showing the dimension of a strip recharge basin for example due to snowmelt t ad and t bd are respectively the dimensionless times of starting and ending of the recharge the fourier sine and laplace transformations are imposed to eq 36 the parameters α and r d p introduced in eq 33 are defined accordingly as 37 α 2 l xd cos β m x

figure eq 33 is used due to complexity of this equation inverse laplace transformation is performed numerically using the de hoog algorithm de hoog et al 1982 the dimensional boundary stream depletion

conductivities of fractures respectively the effects of recharge location on the boundary depletion rate are illustrated in fig 9 single porosity cases blue lines are compared with double porosity ones black lines as expected increasing the distance of recharge location from the left hand side boundary decreases the boundary depletion rate and increases the time lag between the times of recharge and the depletion rate furthermore comparing double porosity and single porosity curves reveals that sdr is lower during the rising limb and higher during the falling limb for the double porosity case this is due to storing of water in matrix blocks during the rising limb and releasing of water from them during the falling limb we further investigate the effects of hydraulic parameters on sdr using default parameters values table 2 and decreasing vertical and horizontal hydraulic conductivity values by an order of magnitude the results are presented in figs 10 12 to test the effects of vertical hydraulic conductivity of the fractures kzf fig 10 is constructed as shown in this figure increasing kzf increases the amplitude of sdr peak the explanation for this is that as kzf increases the vertical component of flow becomes more important this increases the hydraulic head chang et al 2016 and sdr of the aquifer the effects of kxf on sdr are illustrated in fig 11 increasing kxf increases the aquifer diffusivity therefore amplitude phase lag of sdr is proportional inversely proportional with kxf due to the same reason the amplitude and the phase lag of sdr is inversely proportional and proportional with the specific yield sy fig 12 and the specific storage of the matrix block ssm figure not shown respectively 4 5 aquifer parameter estimation to show the application of the presented solution in the hydraulic parameter estimation of an elongated aquifer bounded by two parallel rivers two synthetic test cases are performed default parameter values introduced in table 2 are used the period of the head fluctuations are set to 0 5 day constant recharge with the rate of 5 10 7 m s 1 is considered the head is simulated in an observation point 150 m away from either river at the depth of 5 m below the initial water table head is calculated every 1 h for 50 h the calculated head is considered as the head observation and the analytical model programmed in fortran is linked to ucode poeter and hill 1999 to estimate the aquifer parameters we reduce the optimal parameter values by an order of magnitude and set them as initial parameter values and then run ucode to test if it can estimate the optimal parameter values using calculated head as observations unfortunately the ucode could not estimate true parameter values and extreme parameter correlation correlation more than 0 95 occurs table 3 this shows that the model suffers from non uniqueness hill and tiedeman 2006 we freeze the recharge on its optimal value and run ucode to estimate other hydraulic parameters the parameter correlation is significantly decreases table 4 and ucode can estimate the parameters values nicely the effects of the recharge on the extreme parameter correlation is also discussed by a few previous investigators hill and tiedeman 2006 finally we freeze all hydraulic parameters on their optimal values and allow ucode to estimate the recharge the parameter estimation model can estimate accurate recharge value we repeat the synthetic test case using the head calculated at the deep piezometer at the depth of 45 m below the initial water table the same results are obtained with slightly higher parameter correlation this higher correlation is due to the fact that heads of the deeper piezometer are less sensitive to vertical hydraulic conductivity specific yield and recharge we repeat the simulation and parameter estimation by increasing the period of the head fluctuation of the lateral boundaries to 2 days the same results obtained with higher parameter correlation results not presented to sum up these test cases show that simultaneous estimation of recharge and hydraulic parameters of the coastal aquifer cause extreme parameter correlation and should be avoided it is recommended that the hydraulic parameters should be estimated using head data of dry periods when recharge is absent then the head data collected during the wet or recharge period can be used to estimate recharge value when other hydraulic parameters freeze on their optimal value calculated using head data of dry or no recharge period it should be noted that increasing the period of the lateral boundaries head fluctuation increases the chance of extreme parameter correlation that reduce the model uniqueness 5 summary and conclusion the time domain solutions of groundwater head fluctuation in an elongated aquifer due to general time dependent lateral boundary head and recharge fluctuations are presented in this work we also present laplace domain solution of above problem for the double porosity case the solution is obtained via laplace and fourier transformations first followed by an inverse transform process to time domain following the residue theorem and convolutional integral for the single porosity cases the following applications of the presented solution are presented among others 1 analytical solution of the head fluctuation in an elongated aquifer bounded by two parallel rivers is obtained when eliminating recharge from the solution and considering cosine functions governing head fluctuations in lateral boundaries the effects of hydraulic parameters on memory time are investigated 2 eliminating lateral boundaries head fluctuations the effects of exponentially decaying recharge and constant recharge in a strip basin are investigated and the temporal and spatial head variations calculated using the proposed model are tested against the modflow model 3 considering the stream stage hydrograph including both rising and falling limbs along with areal recharge during the specified period of time the head fluctuations in a river basin aquifer is presented 4 the laplace domain solution of head fluctuation in an elongated double porosity anticline subjected to areal recharge at a specified strip is obtained 5 the boundary depletion rate for the above mentioned setting is obtained and compared with the single porosity case the effects of hydraulic parameters of aquifer on boundary depletion rate are also tested this model is applicable when one wants to investigate the effects of the strip basin recharge e g due to snowmelt in a double porosity anticline reservoir on its depletion to the adjacent alluvial aquifer 6 it is recommended that the hydraulic parameters should be estimated using head data of dry periods when recharge is not occurred then the head data collected during the wet or recharge period can be used to estimate recharge value when other hydraulic parameters freeze on their optimal value calculated using head data of the dry no recharge period acknowledgement the first author wishes to thank payame noor university for financial

6447,glaciers in the upper indus supply more than half of the river water are experiencing significant melting with a debated fate the recent melting rate is still contained by considerable

inventory optimized glacier surface density and validation through in situ differential gps and icesat data our glacier inventory and derived by improving rgi6 0 boundaries and separated into debris

free ice below 20 and 25 slopes 850 60 kg m 3 and above 20 and 25 slopes 600 60 kg m 3 respectively the resulting mass balance biased between 0 20 and 0 09 m water equivalent w e a 1 using an average 850 60 kg m 3 density assumption throughout the indus basin in the western himalaya and hindu kush the glacier mass losses are less affected by the average density assumption compared to the karakoram

casualties haq et al 2012 memon et al 2015 and therefore requires careful monitoring glaciers are mostly observed using remote sensing instruments but most of the studies do not provide full spatial coverage e g gardelle et al 2013 kääb et al 2015 2012 most importantly the majority of previous studies used constant densities for volume to mass change estimations bolch et al 2017 gardelle et al 2013 2012a kääb et al 2015 zhou et al 2017 although a recent study extended the spatial and temporal coverage of glacier observations in the high mountain asia hma brun et al 2017 the study used constant ice densities and existing inventories that may contain significant uncertainties in regions where glaciers are mostly accumulating in steep terrain and the density is significantly lower hewitt 2011 1998 in addition the glacier wide density is also expected to be smaller huss 2013 than the widespread average density applied the average density assumption for volume to mass conversion represents a potential source of error zemp et al 2010 huss 2013 shows that the constant density assumptions also have substantial variability in geodetic mass balance measurements constrained by short temporal coverage in this study we emphasize the sensitivity of ice density assumptions for volume to mass change conversion particularly in the upper part of the glaciers the shuttle radar

volume to mass change estimates on sub basin scale using separated densities for the debris covered and debris free as well as area below and above 20 and 25 slope of glaciers and improved glacier boundaries this allows us to estimate the contribution to discharge in the indus river as well as sea level rise 2 study area the trunk of the indus river originates in the western tibetan plateau flows through ladakh and zanskar river located in the indian administered part of kashmir before entering the mountain areas of gilgit baltistan administered by pakistan and enters the arabian sea its total catchment area is more than 1 1 million km2 with the upper part comprising the hindu kush karakorum and himalayan ranges the headwaters of the indus river are in shiquanhe on the western tibetan plateau and the river then merges with the satluj beas ravi chenab kharmong shyok shingo jhelum astore shigar hunza upper indus gilgit swat and kabul rivers karakoram himalaya and hindukush cover approximately 58 30 and 12 of the glaciers respectively rgi consortium 2017 the basin provides water for commercial and domestic consumption by the downstream population millions of people living downstream are directly or indirectly dependent on indus river water the climate of the upper indus is characterized by sub mediterranean circulation from the west summer monsoon and the anticyclone from tibet hewitt 2011 1998 lutz et al 2016 maussion et al 2014 the upper portions of the indus basin can be classified into high elevation glaciers areas moderate elevation seasonally snow covered areas and low elevation rain fed valley floors archer 2003 fig 1 shows a map of the study area 3 methodology the study uses srtm alos icesat and dgps data the method to process these data comprises of four parts i glacier outline extraction separation into debris covered and debris free ii geometric correction iii srtm c band penetration correction iv surface elevation change and mass balance and v inter comparison of alos srtm icesat and dgps data and uncertainty estimation the method for updating glacier inventory separated into debris covered and debris free is described in supplementary material the details of selected methodological steps are described in the following section 3 1 geometric correction the geodetic method of digital elevation model dem differencing was used to estimate mass balance from the srtm c and alos dems which both have spatial resolutions of 30 m before differencing the dems a co registration was performed to overlay and compare each pixel of both data sets optimally a systematic half pixel planimetric bias existed in the alos dem compared to the srtm owing to the definition of the pixel location corner vs center therefore a shift of 12 73 m and 15 40 m approximately equivalent to half a pixel was applied to the easting and northing directions respectively of the alos dem using the shift tool in arcgis after the shift the dem were differenced and compared on different aspects over non glacier terrain gardelle et al 2013 this process follows the methodology of nuth and kääb 2011 to correct geometric and elevation dependent biases for all the sub basins the altitude dependent biases were corrected for each sub basin applying an average value for each 100 m elevation bin the elevation difference over non glacier areas was compared using the alos and srtm data the distribution of off glacier height differences is within 20 m difference which is expected in a rugged topography berthier et al 2006 kääb 2005 and cause negligible average surface elevation change after removing the outliers 3 2 srtm c band penetration correction one of the major problems associated with srtm data to estimate glacier surface elevation change and mass balance is the c band penetration into ice and snow gardelle et al 2013 kääb et al 2015 2012 before evaluating surface elevation changes and mass balance a correction for the c band penetration into ice and snow was applied to all sub basins the exact correction of the srtm c band penetration depth is difficult to determine because of the lack of knowledge on the precise snow ice conditions at the time of srtm data acquisition nuth and kääb 2011 this study similarly estimated the penetration as in the previous studies gardelle et al 2013 2012a b i e by comparing srtm c with srtm x data over glaciers in each sub basin separately fortunately the release of 30 m srtm c data previously only available in 90 m resolution outside the united states us enabled us to avoid any re sampling discrepancies in comparison with the srtm x data which was already available with a 30 m resolution however the coverage of the penetration estimation was limited to the narrow swath of srtm x data the derived c band penetration is also an approximation as the srtm x band energy also tends to penetrate into ice and snow gardelle et al 2012a b in the central karakoram the estimated bias was expected to be 0 10 m w e a 1 rankl and braun 2016 these estimates have still a limitation of data acquisition in different years because radar penetration varies with time in a year therefore we used the x band penetration calculated in the karakoram region as the penetration bias the c band penetration was calculated for each sub basin to derive surface elevation change estimates the penetration values fluctuate throughout the indus basin and increase as elevation increases on average the penetration values in the hindu kush himalaya and karakoram are estimated to be 2 7 1 3 m 1 7 1 1 m and 2 4 1 3 m respectively the values of penetration increased heterogeneously from an elevation above 4500 m a s l at a threshold of an approximately 2 m and reached up to 10 m in the accumulation area calculated within 100 m elevation bins the c band penetration bias in the glacier surface elevation change was removed using the average values within each 100 m elevation bin for all sub basins the bias in penetration as in the karakoram due to the srtm x and c band ep was added to the uncertainty in the annual mass balance results bolch et al 2017 3 3 glaciers surface elevation change and mass balance estimation after the dem co registration the corrected rgi6 0 glacier boundaries were used to extract the srtm dem and alos dem for the glacierized region the glacier areas of the srtm dem were subtracted from those of the alos dem to obtain the glaciers surface elevation changes eq 1 these changes were used to estimate the annual glacier mass balance 1 δ h h alos h srtm the srtm dem was acquired in february 2000 assuming it as representative of the post ablation season of 1999 bolch et al 2017 although some researchers have considered the effect of accumulation in the current study it is considered as negligible and is equivalent to the srtm x band penetration to remove the bias in addition to the calculated c band penetration we base this assumption on the fact that precipitation in the 1999 2000 winter was the lowest between 1975 and 2005 sarfaraz et al 2015 similarly the snow cover in february 2000 was the lowest in this month between 2000 and 2017 nasa earth observatory 2017 the assumption that srtm represents the ablation period of 1999 is considered to compensate for srtm x band penetration bias the alos dem was generated using images acquired from january 2006 to may 2011 by the prism sensor aboard the alos satellite unfortunately the exact date of the data acquisition is unknown for the alos dem we assume that the alos data are uniformly distributed in space and time in the region this assumption allows us to use 2008 as the median year considering that negligible data were acquired during 2011 with the unknown dates t having a standard deviation of 1 year however this assumption introduces some uncertainty in extreme cases the data might have been acquired in either 2006 or 2010 assuming negligible data obtained in 2011 because the satellite stopped acquiring data from april the uncertainty in the annual glacier change was derived considering both of these cases as the shift represents either six years or ten years the six and ten year changes were subtracted absolute values from the assumed eight year change and averaged for possible uncertainty euo over or underestimation in the estimated surface elevation change as described in eqs 2 4 2 ue a b s o l u t e h alos h srtm 8 h alos h srtm 6 3 oe a b s o l u t e h alos h srtm 8 h alos h srtm 10 4 e uo ue o e 2 e r r o r where ue and oe represent underestimation and overestimation respectively this represents a 2 year uncertainty in the derived results these estimates also contain seasonal uncertainty associated with the unknown data acquisition dates which cannot be directly estimated we expect the seasonal and annual changes in the observed study period to be homogenous considering the insignificant changes in summer and winter temperature and precipitation muhammad and tian 2016 and we have added this uncertainty to the results which increase the uncertainty to 2 5 years et the density of the glacier ice varies from ablation to accumulation zone the derived surface elevation difference was converted into water equivalent w e for glacier ice below and above 20 and 25 slope using srtm 30 m data the slope thresholds are assumed following hewitt 2014 2011 and immerzeel et al 2013 practically the exact variable density quantification is nearly impossible for debris covered and debris free ice on slopes 25 which is mostly in the ablation area 900 60 kg m 3 and 850 60 kg m 3 densities were applied respectively for debris free ice on slopes 25 we used density of 850 60 kg m 3 because some of the ice is not fully compacted and have low density huss 2013 most of the glacier surface ice on slopes steeper than approximately 25 is firn and snow immerzeel et al 2013 khan et al 2015 the firn and snow on slopes 25 which eventually becomes part of a glacier was assigned a density of 600 60 kg m 3 cuffey and paterson 2010 although the above criteria have the possibility of some unknown uncertainty in association with the movement of ice from the accumulation zones to the ablation zones such uncertainty is assumed negligible and unquantifiable the density of the glacier ice below the upper layer is usually quite high while the upper layer density is more important for glacier surface elevation change this assumption may produce some uncertainty in the estimated mass balance therefore we assume an uncertainty of 7 60 kg m 3 huss 2013 the average mass balance results were estimated for each sub basin and mountain range in the indus basin some data are missing from both the srtm and alos acquired dems this restricts the coverage of both the dems to about 63 22 of the glacierized region these data voids are almost entirely located in the accumulation zones due to the poor performance of stereo data on the bright surface snow steep slopes 80 of the data above 25 slope are voids and clouds and by srtm in steep terrain the elevation changes are either positive or relatively very small in these areas in contrast to the significant thinning in the ablation zones neglecting the data voids could produce a negative bias in the average mass balance results bolch et al 2017 pieczonka and bolch 2015 therefore thickness change was estimated in the region with data voids by averaging the values of existing pixels assuming the void pixels experienced the mean elevation change of the measurable pixels in the same altitude interval gardelle et al 2012a b the mean error in the elevation change was derived from the available pixels with values within the most data void regions dividing the elevation change by the total number of available pixels in the voids this error was applied to the average mass balance as possible uncertainty 3 4 inter comparison of alos srtm icesat and dgps data and uncertainty estimation in 2014 and 2015 six glaciers were surveyed to obtain precise ground based dgps measurements and to validate the surface elevation changes derived from the alos and srtm comparison the dgps data were compared with icesat data 2003 2008 for cross validating the annual surface elevation change alos vs srtm within the areas with dgps data assuming homogenous temporal changes between 2000 and 2015 with respect to the insignificant changes in climate data during this period muhammad and tian 2016 the comparison of thickness change in 2003 to 2008 and 2008 to 2015 for sachen and burche glaciers muhammad and tian 2016 further verify the insignificant change in climate data in this period icesat data within a 60 m diameter were re measured at 3 8 well distributed locations as described by muhammad and tian 2016 four glaciers were measured in the hunza sub basin and one glacier each was measured in the upper indus sub basin and the astore sub basin the alos vs srtm and icesat vs srtm comparison is shown in table 1 the dgps based validation of the icesat data is shown in table 2 the dgps data compared to icesat and srtm is confined exclusively to the ablation zones of the glaciers and should only be compared with the data sets in table 2 results for the burche and sachen glaciers have already been published muhammad and tian 2016 whereas data on the other glaciers have not been previously published for comparison the thickness changes were calculated for identical geolocations using alos and srtm data and were compared to those calculated using dgps and srtm data muhammad and tian 2016 the results in table 2 also verify icesat data based validation as shown in table 1 and the difference in elevation change values of sachen and burche glaciers lie within the expected range the dgps based annual elevation changes are higher due to the limited survey in the ablation zone consequently the dgps based validation data over barpu ghulkin minapen and passu contains differences of about 20 to 30 cm a 1 from the srtm and alos based results in the annual surface elevation change the results in tables 1 and 2 should not be compared with the mass balance results in table 4 and the data in these tables are limited to icesat and dgps respectively the difference of column 2 and 3 in table 1 is equal to the difference of alos assumed as acquired in 2008 and icesat 2008 2009 which is the possible uncertainty in the assumption of the alos data acquisition time table 2 is a double check of the uncertainty as in table 1 but not considered for any further analysis the maximum bound of the uncertainty was estimated by equation 5 bolch et al 2017 muhammad et al 2019 5 e e δ h e t e p e m where eδh et ep em are uncertainty associated with thickness change the difference in data acquisition time penetration and density assumption respectively 4 results 4 1 comparison results of updated glacier inventory the difference of glacier inventory in this study compared to icimod and rgi version 4 0 and 6 0 is shown in table 3 the reason for selecting these inventories was the full spatial coverage of the study area glaciers the rgi version 4 0 and 6 0 version 6 0 is similar to 5 0 for the study region were compared to assess the improvement in the current version the rgi4 0 and icimod inventories exhibit overall underestimations when compared to the glacier outlines in this study but the rgi6 0 inventory presents a significant improvement over its previous version the rgi4 0 uncertainties difference with our inventory for the astore and gilgit sub basins are significantly reduced in rgi6 0 from 53 8 and 26 3 to 2 5 and 3 7 respectively for the hunza sub basin the 5 2 underestimation in rgi4 0 shifts to an overestimation of the same magnitude in rgi6 0 note positive signs represent overestimations and negative signs represent underestimations the remaining uncertainty of approximately 5 at most in the glacier outlines in the rgi6 0 glacier inventory was assumed as uncertainty constrained by landsat satellite data quality the overlap ratio of rgi6 0 also shows considerable precision table 3 the spatial differences over underestimations in the glacier outlines in rgi6 0 compared to those in this study are also shown in the maps in supplementary figures s1 s3 some examples of the spatial difference in glacier boundaries of this study and rgi6 0 from astore gilgit and hunza sub basins are shown in fig 2 the main difference in the boundaries is owing to the misclassification of debris covered areas that were mapped in this study and used for the mass balance estimation the total glacier cover area in the improved inventory of the indus basin were 26 029 km2 including 2605 km2 of debris cover debris cover is almost 10 of the total glacier cover 4 2 mass balance estimation the mass balance of glaciers in each sub basin are listed in column 3 and 4 of table 4 one of the most important findings of this study is the sensitivity of mass balance to density assumptions in mass balance method i we used a constant density of 850 60 kg m 3 in mass balance method ii a density of 850 60 kg m 3 for debris free ice with a slope 25 600 60 kg m 3 for debris free ice with a slope 25 and 900 60 kg m 3 for debris covered ice mass balance method iii considers the same ice density assumption as in method i at the slope threshold of 20 in method iv the glacier is divided into two classes i e below and above 20 slope and a density of 900 60 kg m 3 was applied to glacier ice with slopes 20 and 800 60 kg m 3 of density was assumed for glacier ice with slopes 20 the surface elevation changes m and annual mass balance values derived from the method i are labelled in selected sub basins are shown in fig 3 in mass balance method iii the density assumption is similar as in method ii but the slope cut off is 20 mass balance method iv makes only two density assumptions that are 900 60 kg m 3 for debris covered and debris free ice 20 slope and 800 60 kg m 3 for slopes 20 the average density assumption as compared to the other three density assumption criteria produces a bias between 0 20 and 0 09 m w e a 1 the bias is maximum in the densely glacierized sub basins of the karakoram the bias in the hindu kush and himalaya is comparable overall the bias due to the constant density assumption results in a reduction of the imbalance by 35 here we describe results obtained from mass balance method ii as in table 4 all the sub basins of the indus basin show negative mass balance with variable rates the hunza and shigar sub basins karakoram region exhibited negligible mass losses the mass balance of shyok sub basin in the eastern karakoram is more negative compared to the other sub basins in the karakoram in contrast most negative mass balance more negative than 0 34 m w e a 1 is observed in the chenab jhelum and ravi sub basins in the south of the western himalaya the overall mass balance of the hindu kush himalaya region of the indus basin is comparable the glacier mass balance values varied in the karakoram region from east to west and were more heterogeneous in the hindu kush region but were homogenously negative in the himalaya sub basins the estimated mass change from mass balance method ii was converted into gt a 1 as shown in column 5 of table 4 on the regional scale almost half of the mass losses came from the himalaya although the glacier coverage in this region is less than one third of the indus basin on the other hand total mass losses in the hindu kush is half of the karakoram covering only about 12 of the glacierized region about 40 20 and 13 of the mass losses in the indus basins are from the shyok chenab and kabul sub basins respectively the remaining 27 are from the rest of the eleven sub basins as a whole the indus basin contributes approximately 0 014 0 016 mm a 1 to the global mean sea level equivalent 5 discussion variety of earlier research work focused on the glacier mass balance in the indus basin this paper presents a new result on the glacier mass losses in the entire indus basin we used variable glacier ice density for the volume to mass change estimation as the average values produce significant bias particularly for the densely glacierized basins our results of comparing various density assumptions as in table 4 for volume to mass change estimation show significant positive bias particularly in the densely glacierized sub basins of the karakoram we apply variable density huss 2013 for different slopes and differentiate between debris covered and debris free ice hewitt 2014 immerzeel et al 2013 the bias caused by the assumption of the average density of 850 kg m 3 varied between 0 20 and 0 09 m w e a 1 throughout the indus basin the bias comes mainly from the thickness change and glacier cover above 20 and 25 slope where 600 kg m 3 density was assumed the glacier cover area above slopes of 25 is approximately more than 40 of the whole glacierized region but the bias is more concentrated in the karakoram and adjacent region where the magnitude of thickness change of glacier ice above 25 is higher data voids may also produce uncertainty in the mass balance results significant voids 80 in area with a slope 25 may produce a large uncertainty in the results in case of higher density assumption density is most likely to be low in the area however in case of mass loss throughout the glacierized area the possibility of ice density is higher as the surface melt exposes deeper ice with higher densities this is however a probable scenario the variable low density assumptions are more suitable in the areas where the accumulation happens in steep terrain as in most of the indus basin and in some of the hkh region and the mass losses are low or glaciers are even gaining mass therefore we argue that possible variable densities should be considered in such areas the density assumption may be of less importance in areas where the mountains are less steep with less thickness change in the accumulation zones of the glaciers compared to the variable densities the average density assumption produced approximately 35 less imbalance gt a 1 as a whole in addition to data voids unknown acquisition time of datasets may introduce some uncertainty in this study the upper bound of uncertainty due to unknown data acquisition time of alos data is 30 of the annual mass balance results however this uncertainty does not affect the main issue density assumption highlighted in this paper we compared our results for the astore basin to the results from brun et al 2017 fig 4 which we converted from their original 16 year period between 2000 and 2016 to the corresponding period of 2000 and 2008 the overall spatial elevation changes show good agreement with differences from bazhin glacier here our data indicate a surge which has been confirmed by locals as the surged ice is possibly melted away this signal is likely not visible in the data of brun et al 2017 covering a longer period of time such surges are common in the karakoram hewitt 2014 quincey et al 2011 steineret al 2018 and have been reported since the 19th century longstaff 1910 historic and repeat photography nüsser and schmidt 2017 zhu et al 2019 ground based measurements integrated with remote sensing imageries and dems can also be used to understand local scale and long term glacier dynamics muhammad et al 2019 few clearly visible surges can also be seen in fig 3 of this study where ice thickened markedly in some sections of the glacier tongue the derived results show an overall heterogeneous glacier mass balance pattern in the indus basin in the first decade of 21st century the karakoram region in the indus basin except the shyok sub basin shows negligible mass loss compared to the other parts the average mass balance of the karakoram is lower than the gardelle et al 2012a b result of 0 11 0 22 m w e a 1 but closest to the kääb et al 2015 result of 0 10 0 06 m w e a 1 the mass losses in the western and central karakoram kääb et al 2015 are negligible in contrast to the eastern karakoram where the mass balance values are comparable to those in the adjacent himalaya sub basins summer runoff in the karakoram sub basins i e hunza shigar and shyok is equally strongly correlated with mass balance and summer temperature measured at valley locations archer and fowler 2004 in addition the long term mass balance observations in the karakoram spanning the period 1973 2009 show negligible loss and are of the same order of magnitude as in this study bolch et al 2017 zhou et al 2017 these studies extend the negligible and anomalously low mass loss status of the karakoram back to the 1970s the most recent mass balance results of the karakoram covering the period of 2000 to 2016 show slightly less negative mass balance than estimated during 2003 2008 in the same study brun et al 2017 and this paper these results suggest that the mass loss is slower in the second decade than the first decade of this century in addition area changes in the central karakoram and the upper part of shyok sub basin in the karakoram are also insignificant between 1973 and 2011 bhambri et al 2013 the glaciers in the adjacent western kunlun shan show a slight mass gain observed previously for 2003 2009 gardner et al 2013 kääb et al 2015 neckel et al 2014 further extended recently to the period of 2000 2014 lin et al 2017 in contrast the retreat rates and mass losses of the himalayan glaciers are the highest in the region the glacier mass balance in the south of the himalaya including the chenab jhelum and ravi sub basins is noticeably negative comparatively to the other sub basins however the losses in these sub basins excluding chenab only exert a small effect on the river flows because of the small glacial coverage on average glaciers in the western himalaya was losing mass at a rate of 0 30 0 26 m w e a 1 during the study period brun et al 2017 gardelle et al 2013 kääb et al 2015 further studies with extended spatial coverage by high resolution satellite data and measurements of glacier ice density are recommended to reduce the possible uncertainty in glacier mass balance estimations the negative mass balance during the study period contributed approximately 0 014 0 016 mm a 1 to global sea level equivalent this imbalance is equivalent to one third of the contribution by all the glaciers in the hma estimated during 2000 2016 by brun et al 2017 while covering one fourth of the total glacierized area these results suggest that declining mass in the indus basin are of similar importance as in the rest of hma the study shows that the glacier mass losses are mostly from the himalaya and the hindu kush regions in the indus basin future changes in the climate will affect glaciers and the downstream river flows and the 21st century projections of these changes are extremely uncertain immerzeel et al 2013 lutz et al 2016 it is therefore crucial to collect more data in the field asad et al 2017 and using remote sensing to understand the mass imbalance better 6 conclusions this study estimated the recent glacier mass balance in the indus basin during the beginning of the 21st century based on 30 m alos and srtm dem data in conjunction with separated density assumptions for debris covered and debris free ice above and below 20 and 25 slope and improved rgi6 0 glacier outlines the separated density assumption reduces significant bias in volume to mass conversion constrained by thickness change of the glaciers in steep terrain above slopes of 20 and 25 a constant density of 850 60 kg m 3 in a more extended period 3 years as suggested by huss 2013 may not be useful for glaciers with significant positive thickness change the improved and separated inventory debris covered and debris free were further classified for snow density assumption and may reduce uncertainty in total mass budget estimates at the indus basin scale the mass balance is extremely negative in the northwest of the southern sub basins the estimated mass balance of the glaciers in the western himalaya are comparable to those in the hindu kush where the effect of density assumption is comparatively lower than the karakoram because of the small thickness change by glacier cover above a slope of 25 we found a contrasting pattern between east and west of the karakoram glaciers during the study period with significant bias between 0 20 and 0 09 m w e a 1 as compared to a constant density 850 kg m 3 assumption throughout the glacierized area the density assumption must be used with caution as it depends on several factors including the magnitude of elevation changes in addition to the terrain as considered here the whole indus basin 25 glacier cover of asia contribution to sea level equivalent is 0 014 0 016 mm a 1 which is one third 0 04 mm a 1 of the hma brun et al 2017 in the early twenty first century however continuous glaciers monitoring in the region and accurate glacier ice density assumptions for volume to mass conversion in future are critical acknowledgments this work is funded by the national natural science foundation of china grant

6447,glaciers in the upper indus supply more than half of the river water are experiencing significant melting with a debated fate the recent melting rate is still contained by considerable uncertainties hindering to estimate precise glacier mass change here we present geodetic mass balance results for the whole indus basin using srtm and alos 30 m elevation data improved glacier inventory optimized glacier surface density and validation through in situ differential gps and icesat data our glacier inventory and derived by improving rgi6 0 boundaries and separated into debris

free ice below 20 and 25 slopes 850 60 kg m 3 and above 20 and 25 slopes 600 60 kg m 3 respectively the resulting mass balance biased between 0 20 and 0 09 m water equivalent w e a 1 using an average 850 60 kg m 3 density assumption throughout the indus basin in the western himalaya and hindu kush the glacier mass losses are less affected by the average density assumption compared to the karakoram

the eastern shyok karakoram all the sub basins exhibit negative mass balances with the most negative values ranging from 0 34 0 31 to 0 44 0 27 m w e a 1 in the ravi chenab and jhelum sub basins of the himalaya the whole indus basin contributes approximately 0 014 0 016 mm a 1 to the global mean sea level equivalent keywords remote sensing mass balance density assumptions indus basin karakoram 1

coverage e g gardelle et al 2013 kääb et al 2015 2012 most importantly the majority of previous studies used constant densities for volume to mass change estimations bolch et al 2017 gardelle et al 2013 2012a kääb et al 2015 zhou et al 2017 although a recent study extended the spatial and temporal coverage of glacier observations in the high mountain asia hma brun et al 2017 the study used constant ice densities and existing inventories that may contain significant uncertainties in regions where glaciers are mostly accumulating in steep terrain and the density is significantly lower hewitt 2011 1998 in addition the glacier wide density is also expected to be smaller huss 2013 than the widespread average density applied the average density assumption for volume to mass conversion represents a potential source of error zemp et al 2010 huss 2013 shows that the constant density assumptions also have substantial variability in geodetic mass balance measurements constrained by short temporal coverage in this study we emphasize the sensitivity of ice density assumptions for volume to mass change conversion particularly in the upper part of the glaciers the shuttle radar topographic mission srtm advanced land observing satellite alos 30 m elevation data and the latest available glacier boundaries rgi6 0 that were improved and separated into debris covered and debris free part kraaijenbrink et al 2017 in this study fulfilled our objective icesat and dgps data helped to validate wesche et al 2009 the glacier mass balance results this study provides estimates of volume to mass change estimates on sub basin scale using separated densities for the debris covered and debris free as well as area below and above 20 and 25 slope of glaciers and improved glacier boundaries this allows us to estimate the contribution to discharge in the indus river as well as sea level rise 2 study area the trunk of the indus river originates in the western tibetan plateau flows through ladakh and zanskar river located in the indian administered part of kashmir before entering the mountain areas of gilgit baltistan administered by pakistan and enters the arabian sea its total catchment area is more than 1 1 million km2 with the upper part comprising the hindu kush karakorum and himalayan ranges the headwaters of the indus river are in shiquanhe on the western tibetan plateau and the river then merges with the satluj beas ravi chenab kharmong shyok shingo jhelum astore shigar hunza upper indus gilgit swat and kabul rivers karakoram himalaya and hindukush cover approximately 58 30 and 12 of the glaciers respectively rgi consortium 2017 the basin provides water for commercial and domestic consumption by the downstream population millions of people living downstream are directly or indirectly dependent on indus river water the climate of the upper indus is characterized by sub mediterranean circulation from the west summer monsoon and the anticyclone from tibet hewitt 2011 1998 lutz et al 2016 maussion et al 2014 the upper portions of the indus basin can be classified into high elevation glaciers areas moderate elevation seasonally snow covered areas and low elevation rain fed valley floors archer 2003 fig 1 shows a map of the study area 3 methodology the study uses srtm alos icesat and dgps data the method to process these data comprises of four parts i glacier outline extraction separation into debris covered and debris free ii geometric correction iii srtm c band penetration correction iv surface elevation change and mass balance and v inter comparison of alos srtm icesat and dgps data and uncertainty estimation the method for updating glacier inventory separated into debris covered and debris free is described in supplementary material the details of selected methodological steps are described in the following section 3 1 geometric correction the geodetic method of digital elevation model dem differencing was used to estimate mass balance from the srtm c and alos dems which both have spatial resolutions of 30 m before differencing the dems a co registration was performed to overlay and compare each pixel of both data sets optimally a systematic half pixel planimetric bias existed in the alos dem compared to the srtm owing to the definition of the pixel location corner vs center therefore a shift of 12 73 m and 15 40 m approximately equivalent to half a pixel was applied to the easting and northing directions respectively of the alos dem using the shift tool in arcgis after the shift the dem were differenced and compared on different aspects over non glacier terrain gardelle et al 2013 this process follows the methodology of nuth and kääb 2011 to correct geometric and elevation dependent biases for all the sub basins the altitude dependent biases were corrected for each sub basin applying an average value for each 100 m elevation bin the elevation difference over non glacier areas was compared using the alos and srtm data the distribution of off glacier height differences is within 20 m difference which is expected in a rugged topography berthier et al 2006 kääb 2005 and cause negligible average surface elevation change after removing the outliers 3 2 srtm c band penetration correction one of the major problems associated with srtm data to estimate glacier surface elevation change and mass balance is the c band penetration into ice and snow gardelle et al 2013 kääb et al 2015 2012 before evaluating surface elevation changes and mass balance a correction for the c band penetration into ice and snow was applied to all sub basins the exact correction of the srtm c band penetration depth is difficult to determine because of the lack of knowledge on the precise snow ice conditions at the time of srtm data acquisition nuth and kääb 2011 this study similarly estimated the penetration as in the previous studies gardelle et al 2013 2012a b i e by comparing srtm c with srtm x data over glaciers in each sub basin separately fortunately the release of 30 m srtm c data previously only available in 90 m resolution outside the united states us enabled us to avoid any re sampling discrepancies in comparison with the srtm x data which was already available with a 30 m resolution however the coverage of the penetration estimation was limited to the narrow swath of srtm x data the derived c band penetration is also an approximation as the srtm x band energy also tends to penetrate into ice and snow gardelle et al 2012a b in the central karakoram the estimated bias was expected to be 0 10 m w e a 1 rankl and braun 2016 these estimates have still a limitation of data acquisition in different years because radar penetration varies with time in a year therefore we used the x band penetration calculated in the karakoram region as the penetration bias the c band penetration was calculated for each sub basin to derive surface elevation change estimates the penetration values fluctuate throughout the indus basin and increase as elevation increases on average the penetration values in the hindu kush himalaya and karakoram are estimated to be 2 7 1 3 m 1 7 1 1 m and 2 4 1 3 m respectively the values of penetration increased heterogeneously from an elevation above 4500 m a s l at a threshold of an approximately 2 m and reached up to 10 m in the accumulation area calculated within 100 m elevation bins the c band penetration bias in the glacier surface elevation change was removed using the average values within each 100 m elevation bin for all sub basins the bias in penetration as in the karakoram due to the srtm x and c band ep was added to the uncertainty in the annual mass balance results bolch et al 2017 3 3 glaciers surface elevation change and mass balance estimation after the dem co registration the corrected rgi6 0 glacier boundaries were used to extract the srtm dem and alos dem for the glacierized region the glacier areas of the srtm dem were subtracted from those of the alos dem to obtain the glaciers surface elevation changes eq 1 these changes were used to estimate the annual glacier mass balance 1 δ h h alos h srtm the srtm dem was acquired in february 2000 assuming it as representative of the post ablation season of 1999 bolch et al 2017 although some researchers have considered the effect of accumulation in the current study it is considered as negligible and is equivalent to the srtm x band penetration to remove the bias in addition to the calculated c band penetration we base this assumption on the fact that precipitation in the 1999 2000 winter was the lowest between 1975 and 2005 sarfaraz et al 2015 similarly the snow cover in february 2000 was the lowest in this month between 2000 and 2017 nasa earth observatory 2017 the assumption that srtm represents the ablation period of 1999 is considered to compensate for srtm x band penetration bias the alos dem was generated using images acquired from january 2006 to may 2011 by the prism sensor aboard the alos satellite unfortunately the exact date of the data acquisition is unknown for the alos dem we assume that the alos data are uniformly distributed in space and time in the region this assumption allows us to use 2008 as the median year considering that negligible data were acquired during 2011 with the unknown dates t having a standard deviation of 1 year however this assumption introduces some uncertainty in extreme cases the data might have been acquired in either 2006 or 2010 assuming negligible data obtained in 2011 because the satellite stopped acquiring data from april the uncertainty in the annual glacier change was derived considering both of these cases as the shift represents either six years or ten years the six and ten year changes were subtracted absolute values from the assumed eight year change and averaged for possible uncertainty euo over or underestimation in the estimated surface elevation change as described in eqs 2 4 2 ue a b s o l u t e h alos h srtm 8 h alos h srtm 6 3 oe a b s o l u t e h alos h srtm 8 h alos h srtm 10 4 e uo ue o e 2 e r r o r where ue and oe represent underestimation and overestimation respectively this represents a 2 year uncertainty in the derived results these estimates also contain seasonal uncertainty associated with the unknown data acquisition dates which cannot be directly estimated we expect the seasonal and annual changes in the observed study period to be homogenous considering the insignificant changes in summer and winter temperature and precipitation muhammad and tian 2016 and we have added this uncertainty to the results which increase the uncertainty to 2 5 years et the density of the glacier ice varies from ablation to accumulation zone the derived surface elevation difference was converted into water equivalent w e for glacier ice below and above 20 and 25 slope using srtm 30 m data the slope thresholds are assumed following hewitt 2014 2011 and immerzeel et al 2013 practically the exact variable density quantification is nearly impossible for debris covered and debris free ice on slopes 25 which is mostly in the ablation area 900 60 kg m 3 and 850 60 kg m 3 densities were applied respectively for debris free ice on slopes 25 we used density of 850 60 kg m 3 because some of the ice is not fully compacted and have low density huss 2013 most of the glacier surface ice on slopes steeper than approximately 25 is firn and snow immerzeel et al 2013 khan et al 2015 the firn and snow on slopes 25 which eventually becomes part of a glacier was assigned a density of 600 60 kg m 3 cuffey and paterson 2010 although the above criteria have the possibility of some unknown uncertainty in association with the movement of ice from the accumulation zones to the ablation zones such uncertainty is assumed negligible and unquantifiable the density of the glacier ice below the upper layer is usually quite high while the upper layer density is more important for glacier surface elevation change this assumption may produce some uncertainty in the estimated mass balance therefore we assume an uncertainty of 7 60 kg m 3 huss 2013 the average mass balance results were estimated for each sub basin and mountain range in the indus basin some data are missing from both the srtm and alos acquired dems this restricts the coverage of both the dems to about 63 22 of the glacierized region these data voids are almost entirely located in the accumulation zones due to the poor performance of stereo data on the bright surface snow steep slopes 80 of the data above 25 slope are voids and clouds and by srtm in steep terrain the elevation changes are either positive or relatively very small in these areas in contrast to the significant thinning in the ablation zones neglecting the data voids could produce a negative bias in the average mass balance results bolch et al 2017 pieczonka and bolch 2015 therefore thickness change was estimated in the region with data voids by averaging the values of existing pixels assuming the void pixels experienced the mean elevation change of the measurable pixels in the same altitude interval gardelle et al 2012a b the mean error in the elevation change was derived from the available pixels with values within the most data void regions dividing the elevation change by the total number of available pixels in the voids this error was applied to the average mass balance as possible uncertainty 3 4 inter comparison of alos srtm icesat and dgps data and uncertainty estimation in 2014 and 2015 six glaciers were surveyed to obtain precise ground based dgps measurements and to validate the surface elevation changes derived from the alos and srtm comparison the dgps data were compared with icesat data 2003 2008 for cross validating the annual surface elevation change alos vs srtm within the areas with dgps data assuming homogenous temporal changes between 2000 and 2015 with respect to the insignificant changes in climate data during this period muhammad and tian 2016 the comparison of thickness change in 2003 to 2008 and 2008 to 2015 for sachen and burche glaciers muhammad and tian 2016 further verify the insignificant change in climate data in this period icesat data within a 60 m diameter were re measured at 3 8 well distributed locations as described by muhammad and tian 2016 four glaciers were measured in the hunza sub basin and one glacier each was measured in the upper indus sub basin and the astore sub basin the alos vs srtm and icesat vs srtm comparison is shown in table 1 the dgps based validation of the icesat data is shown in table 2 the dgps data compared to icesat and srtm is confined exclusively to the ablation zones of the glaciers and should only be compared with the data sets in table 2 results for the burche and sachen glaciers have already been published muhammad and tian 2016 whereas data on the other glaciers have not been previously published for comparison the thickness changes were calculated for identical geolocations using alos and srtm data and were compared to those calculated using dgps and srtm data muhammad and tian 2016 the results in table 2 also verify icesat data based validation as shown in table 1 and the difference in elevation change values of sachen and burche glaciers lie within the expected range the dgps based annual elevation changes are higher due to the limited survey in the ablation zone consequently the dgps based validation data over barpu ghulkin minapen and passu contains differences of about 20 to 30 cm a 1 from the srtm and alos based results in the annual surface elevation change the results in tables 1 and 2 should not be compared with the mass balance results in table 4 and the data in these tables are limited to icesat and dgps respectively the difference of column 2 and 3 in table 1 is equal to the difference of alos assumed as acquired in 2008 and icesat 2008 2009 which is the possible uncertainty in the assumption of the alos data acquisition time table 2 is a double check of the uncertainty as in table 1 but not considered for any further analysis the maximum bound of the uncertainty was estimated by equation 5 bolch et al 2017 muhammad et al 2019 5 e e δ h e t e p e m where eδh et ep em are uncertainty associated with thickness change the difference in data acquisition time penetration and density assumption respectively 4 results 4 1 comparison results of updated glacier inventory the difference of glacier inventory in this study compared to icimod and rgi version 4 0 and 6 0 is shown in table 3 the reason for selecting these inventories was the full spatial coverage of the study area glaciers the rgi version 4 0 and 6 0 version 6 0 is similar to 5 0 for the study region were compared to assess the improvement in the current version the rgi4 0 and icimod inventories exhibit overall underestimations when compared to the glacier outlines in this study but the rgi6 0 inventory presents a significant improvement over its previous version the rgi4 0 uncertainties difference with our inventory for the astore and gilgit sub basins are significantly reduced in rgi6 0 from 53 8 and 26 3 to 2 5 and 3 7 respectively for the hunza sub basin the 5 2 underestimation in rgi4 0 shifts to an overestimation of the same magnitude in rgi6 0 note positive signs represent overestimations and negative signs represent underestimations the remaining uncertainty of approximately 5 at most in the glacier outlines in the rgi6 0 glacier inventory was assumed as uncertainty constrained by landsat satellite data quality the overlap ratio of rgi6 0 also shows considerable precision table 3 the spatial differences over underestimations in the glacier outlines in rgi6 0 compared to those in this study are also shown in the maps in supplementary figures s1 s3 some examples of the spatial difference in glacier boundaries of this study and rgi6 0 from astore gilgit and hunza sub basins are shown in fig 2 the main difference in the boundaries is owing to the misclassification of debris covered areas that were mapped in this study and used for the mass balance estimation the total glacier cover area in the improved inventory of the indus basin were 26 029 km2 including 2605 km2 of debris cover debris cover is almost 10 of the total glacier cover 4 2 mass balance estimation the mass balance of glaciers in each sub basin are listed in column 3 and 4 of table 4 one of the most important findings of this study is the sensitivity of mass balance to density assumptions in mass balance method i we used a constant density of 850 60 kg m 3 in mass balance method ii a density of 850 60 kg m 3 for debris free ice with a slope 25 600 60 kg m 3 for debris free ice with a slope 25 and 900 60 kg m 3 for debris covered ice mass balance method iii considers the same ice density assumption as in method i at the slope threshold of 20 in method iv the glacier is divided into two classes i e below and above 20 slope and a density of 900 60 kg m 3 was applied to glacier ice with slopes 20 and 800 60 kg m 3 of density was assumed for glacier ice with slopes 20 the surface elevation changes m and annual mass balance values derived from the method i are labelled in selected sub basins are shown in fig 3 in mass balance method iii the density assumption is similar as in method ii but the slope cut off is 20 mass balance method iv makes only two density assumptions that are 900 60 kg m 3 for debris covered and debris free ice 20 slope and 800 60 kg m 3 for slopes 20 the average density assumption as compared to the other three density assumption criteria produces a bias between 0 20 and 0 09 m w e a 1 the bias is maximum in the densely glacierized sub basins of the karakoram the bias in the hindu kush and himalaya is comparable overall the bias due to the constant density assumption results in a reduction of the imbalance by 35 here we describe results obtained from mass balance method ii as in table 4 all the sub basins of the indus basin show negative mass balance with variable rates the hunza and shigar sub basins karakoram region exhibited negligible mass losses the mass balance of shyok sub basin in the eastern karakoram is more negative compared to the other sub basins in the karakoram in contrast most negative mass balance more negative than 0 34 m w e a 1 is observed in the chenab jhelum and ravi sub basins in the south of the western himalaya the overall mass balance of the hindu kush himalaya region of the indus basin is comparable the glacier mass balance values varied in the karakoram region from east to west and were more heterogeneous in the hindu kush region but were homogenously negative in the himalaya sub basins the estimated mass change from mass balance method ii was converted into gt a 1 as shown in column 5 of table 4 on the regional scale almost half of the mass losses came from the himalaya although the glacier coverage in this region is less than one third of the indus basin on the other hand total mass losses in the hindu kush is half of the karakoram covering only about 12 of the glacierized region about 40 20 and 13 of the mass losses in the indus basins are from the shyok chenab and kabul sub basins respectively the remaining 27 are from the rest of the eleven sub basins as a whole the indus basin contributes approximately 0 014 0 016 mm a 1 to the global mean sea level equivalent 5 discussion variety of earlier research work focused on the glacier mass balance in the indus basin this paper presents a new result on the glacier mass losses in the entire indus basin we used variable glacier ice density for the volume to mass change estimation as the average values produce significant bias particularly for the densely glacierized basins our results of comparing various density assumptions as in table 4 for volume to mass change estimation show significant positive bias particularly in the densely glacierized sub basins of the karakoram we apply variable density huss 2013 for different slopes and differentiate between debris covered and debris free ice hewitt 2014 immerzeel et al 2013 the bias caused by the assumption of the average density of 850 kg m 3 varied between 0 20 and 0 09 m w e a 1 throughout the indus basin the bias comes mainly from the thickness change and glacier cover above 20 and 25 slope where 600 kg m 3 density was assumed the glacier cover area above slopes of 25 is approximately more than 40 of the whole glacierized region but the bias is more concentrated in the karakoram and adjacent region where the magnitude of thickness change of glacier ice above 25 is higher data voids may also produce uncertainty in the mass balance results significant voids 80 in area with a slope 25 may produce a large uncertainty in the results in case of higher density assumption density is most likely to be low in the area however in case of mass loss throughout the glacierized area the possibility of ice density is higher as the surface melt exposes deeper ice with higher densities this is however a probable scenario the variable low density assumptions are more suitable in the areas where the accumulation happens in steep terrain as in most of the indus basin and in some of the hkh region and the mass losses are low or glaciers are even gaining mass therefore we argue that possible variable densities should be considered in such areas the density assumption may be of less importance in areas where the mountains are less steep with less thickness change in the accumulation zones of the glaciers compared to the variable densities the average density assumption produced approximately 35 less imbalance gt a 1 as a whole in addition to data voids unknown acquisition time of datasets may introduce some uncertainty in this study the upper bound of uncertainty due to unknown data acquisition time of alos data is 30 of the annual mass balance results however this uncertainty does not affect the main issue density assumption highlighted in this paper we compared our results for the astore basin to the results from brun et al 2017 fig 4 which we converted from their original 16 year period between 2000 and 2016 to the corresponding period of 2000 and 2008 the overall spatial elevation changes show good agreement with differences from bazhin glacier here our data indicate a surge which has been confirmed by locals as the surged ice is possibly melted away this signal is likely not visible in the data of brun et al 2017 covering a longer period of time such surges are common in the karakoram hewitt 2014 quincey et al 2011 steineret al 2018 and have been reported since the 19th century longstaff 1910 historic and repeat photography nüsser and schmidt 2017 zhu et al 2019 ground based measurements integrated with remote sensing imageries and dems can also be used to understand local scale and long term glacier dynamics muhammad et al 2019 few clearly visible surges can also be seen in fig 3 of this study where ice thickened markedly in some sections of the glacier tongue the derived results show an overall heterogeneous glacier mass balance pattern in the indus basin in the first decade of 21st century the karakoram region in the indus basin except the shyok sub basin shows negligible mass loss compared to the other parts the average mass balance of the karakoram is lower than the gardelle et al 2012a b result of 0 11 0 22 m w e a 1 but closest to the kääb et al 2015 result of 0 10 0 06 m w e a 1 the mass losses in the western and central karakoram kääb et al 2015 are negligible in contrast to the eastern karakoram where the mass balance values are comparable to those in the adjacent himalaya sub basins summer runoff in the karakoram sub basins i e hunza shigar and shyok is equally strongly correlated with mass balance and summer temperature measured at valley locations archer and fowler 2004 in addition the long term mass balance observations in the karakoram spanning the period 1973 2009 show negligible loss and are of the same order of magnitude as in this study bolch et al 2017 zhou et al 2017 these studies extend the negligible and anomalously low mass loss status of the karakoram back to the 1970s the most recent mass balance results of the karakoram covering the period of 2000 to 2016 show slightly less negative mass balance than estimated during 2003 2008 in the same study brun et al 2017 and this paper these results suggest that the mass loss is slower in the second decade than the first decade of this century in addition area changes in the central karakoram and the upper part of shyok sub basin in the karakoram are also insignificant between 1973 and 2011 bhambri et al 2013 the glaciers in the adjacent western kunlun shan show a slight mass gain observed previously for 2003 2009 gardner et al 2013 kääb et al 2015 neckel et al 2014 further extended recently to the period of 2000 2014 lin et al 2017 in contrast the retreat rates and mass losses of the himalayan glaciers are the highest in the region the glacier mass balance in the south of the himalaya including the chenab jhelum and ravi sub basins is noticeably negative comparatively to the other sub basins however the losses in these sub basins excluding chenab only exert a small effect on the river flows because of the small glacial coverage on average glaciers in the western himalaya was losing mass at a rate of 0 30 0 26 m w e a 1 during the study period brun et al 2017 gardelle et al 2013 kääb et al 2015 further studies with extended spatial coverage by high resolution satellite data and measurements of glacier ice density are recommended to reduce the possible uncertainty in glacier mass balance estimations the negative mass balance during the study period contributed approximately 0 014 0 016 mm a 1 to global sea level equivalent this imbalance is equivalent to one third of the contribution by all the glaciers in the hma estimated during 2000 2016 by brun et al 2017 while covering one fourth of the total glacierized area these results suggest that declining mass in the indus basin are of similar importance as in the rest of hma the study shows that the glacier mass losses are mostly from the himalaya and the hindu kush regions in the indus basin future changes in the climate will affect glaciers and the downstream river flows and the 21st century projections of these changes are extremely uncertain immerzeel et al 2013 lutz et al 2016 it is therefore crucial to collect more data in the field asad et al 2017 and using remote sensing to understand the mass imbalance better 6 conclusions this study estimated the recent glacier mass balance in the indus basin during the beginning of the 21st century based on 30 m alos and srtm dem data in conjunction with separated density assumptions for debris covered and debris free ice above and below 20 and 25 slope and improved rgi6 0 glacier outlines the separated density assumption reduces significant bias in volume to mass conversion constrained by thickness change of the glaciers in steep terrain above slopes of 20 and 25 a constant density of 850 60 kg m 3 in a more extended period 3 years as suggested by huss 2013 may not be useful for glaciers with significant positive thickness change the improved and separated inventory debris covered and debris free were further classified for snow density assumption and may reduce uncertainty in total mass budget estimates at the indus basin scale the mass balance is extremely negative in the northwest of the southern sub basins the estimated mass balance of the glaciers in the western himalaya are comparable to those in the hindu kush where the effect of density assumption is comparatively lower than the karakoram because of the small thickness change by glacier cover above a slope of 25 we found a contrasting pattern between east and west of the karakoram glaciers during the study period with significant bias between 0 20 and 0 09 m w e a 1 as compared to a constant density 850 kg m 3 assumption throughout the glacierized area the density assumption must be used with caution as it depends on several factors including the magnitude of elevation changes in addition to the terrain as considered here the whole indus basin 25 glacier cover of asia contribution to sea level equivalent is 0 014 0 016 mm a 1 which is one third 0 04 mm a 1 of the hma brun et al 2017 in the early twenty first century however continuous glaciers monitoring in the region and accurate glacier ice density assumptions for volume to mass conversion in future are critical acknowledgments this work is funded by the national natural science foundation of china grant

6448,groundwater dating information is important for safety assessment for geological disposal of high level radioactive waste radiokrypton 81kr is an excellent tracer for dating old groundwater with a residence time up to 1 ma we have optimized a hollow fiber based device for extracting 81kr from deep groundwater with low hydraulic conductivity for the purpose of estimating its residence time such a device must show a high kr extraction efficiency and an ultra low level of contamination from modern air and must allow for in situ evaluation of kr extraction efficiency the optimal devices reported herein showed minimal contamination by 81kr from modern air and the efficiency of kr extraction from high salinity groundwater exceeded 90 furthermore we confirmed that the 222rn was a suitable indicator of kr extraction efficiency keywords radiokrypton deep groundwater hollow fiber 222rn radioactive waste disposal 1 introduction groundwater immobility is required for safe disposal of high level radioactive waste in deep geological repositories estimating the mobility of any radioactive nuclide that might leach from buried waste requires knowledge of the groundwater flow in the bedrock where the repositories will be constructed assessment of whether disposal of radioactive waste in a geological repository is safe requires knowledge of the groundwater residence time which is one of the most important factors needed to estimate groundwater mobility an excellent way to determine groundwater mobility is to compare the residence time of the groundwater with the date of sedimentation of the basement rocks that make up the basin mahara et al 2012 2013 nakata et al 2018 the most appropriate method of dating groundwater is measurement of its 81kr concentration atoms l because in groundwater the only source of most of the dissolved 81kr half life 0 229 ma which is chemically inert is cosmic ray spallation in the upper atmosphere recently it has been possible to measure 81kr by using the atom trap trace analysis atta method lu et al 2014 jiang et al 2012 the method probably determines the residence time to within 1 ma lehmann et al 1991 2003 du et al 2003

under high vacuum a tiny amount of radiokrypton from the groundwater seeping through the very low permeability geological environment surrounding the repository the groundwater flowing condition which we target wolud be 1 l min our study required development of the technology to extract radiokrypton from slowly moving groundwater without contamination from modern atmospheric krypton the development of efficient portable devices for on site extraction of dissolved kr from large amounts of groundwater was crucial to the long term in situ extraction operation radioisotopes of kr 81kr and 85kr have recently been extracted from large amounts of groundwater via hollow fiber systems probst et al 2007 ohta et al 2009 yokochi 2016 this method effectively extracts all dissolved gases from large amounts of groundwater we used this method to successfully extract radiokrypton at high hydrostatic pressure 4 mpa from water with a high salinity 35 or higher without contamination from modern air which must be minimized for accurate estimation of groundwater residence times via 81kr dating we therefore used a suitable indicator to evaluate the extent of in situ contamination by kr from modern air that contamination resulted mainly from leakage of air and from mixing of groundwater with drilling water during the boring operation we have previously hypothesized that dissolved co2 and 222rn another noble gas might be suitable indicators of the efficiency of 81kr extraction from deep groundwater ohta et al 2009 and we evaluated that hypothesis in this study our goals were to design a portable device that could efficiently extract sufficient amounts of kr from 100 l of deep groundwater in situ with negligible contamination by 81kr from modern air under high pressure high salinity conditions in this study we describe the development of a new hollow fiber system that can be operated in an impermeable geo environment the 222rn extraction efficiency served as an indicator of kr extraction efficiency 2 material and methods 2 1 design of devices we have designed and tested three types of hollow fiber based devices designated v 2 v 7 and v 8 for extracting kr from deep groundwater fig 1 these devices consist of three main parts a system for extracting gas from the groundwater a system for transporting the extracted gas and a cylinder for collecting the gas the specifications of the vacuum pumps and the hollow fiber modules used in the three devices are listed in table 1 the hollow fibers were composed of poly 4 methyl pentene 1 and the hollow fiber modules were of the external pressure type that is the groundwater was in contact with the outer surface of the fiber and a vacuum was applied from inside the fiber in this type of system the water flow on the outer surface of the fiber is turbulent so a boundary layer is usually not produced as is the case for internal pressure type systems and therefore the extraction efficiency is improved by an increase in the gas permeation rate the pre filter and the hollow fiber modules were housed in a tank of water to prevent kr in modern air from entering from the outer surfaces of the modules water is a simple excellent barrier to the intrusion of modern air 2 2 leakage assessment using atmospheric o2 to check for leakage of modern air into the system via the surfaces of three of the vacuum pumps vp 2 vp 3 and vp 4 table 1 we determined the volume of leaking modern air by means of a water replacement method after pumping briefly the inlet of each vacuum pump was sealed with a metal cap line blind valve the outlet of the pump was fitted with a teflon tube and the open end of the tube was immersed in 3 l of water in a glass bottle which was inverted and placed in a 5 l plastic beaker over the course of 12 h no visible leaks were observed in any of the three tested vacuum pumps furthermore we used the presence of oxygen in deep groundwater as an indicator of contamination by kr from modern air because air contains 20 9 oxygen whereas oxygen is usually not present in deep groundwater the v 7 and v 8 devices were used to extract gases from deep groundwater samples collected at depths of 214 250 613 and 943 m the oxygen concentrations in the collected gases were measured to check for the presence of kr derived from modern air the major dissolved gases ch4 o2 co2 n2 and h2 in the deep groundwater were collected by means of a water replacement system wr and a hollow fiber system hf and were collected into a metallic gas cylinder and or an aluminum bag the ch4 o2 co2 n2 and h2 concentrations were measured by means of gas chromatography on an instrument agilent 490 micro gas chromatograph agilent japan equipped with a cycle pump unit cp2900 agilent japan 2 3 laboratory tests 2 3 1 measurement of the pressure in the hollow fiber the pressure in the gas cylinder and the dissolved oxygen concentration in the drain water the optimal pressures in the hollow fiber and the gas cylinder were determined by means of a laboratory experiment involving tap water collected at the central research institute of the electric power industry chiba japan a tap water sample was first pumped though a 5 μm pore size pre filter and then through the hollow fiber module under vacuum gas dissolved in the sample was extracted via the inner surface of the fiber under vacuum and then drained out of the module via the outlet fig 1a b the dissolved oxygen do concentrations in the initial sample water before the pre filter and in the drained water were continuously measured with a do meter horiba co japan we measured the pressure in the hollow fiber by means of a vacuum gauge and the pressure in the gas cylinder by means of a compound pressure gauge p1 and p2 respectively fig 1a b the water velocity at the inlet of the devices was measured with a total flow meter llw 05 ttn horiba co japan 2 3 2 extraction of do and 222rn with the hollow fiber based devices at various contact times the efficiency of gas extraction by the devices v 2 v 7 and v 8 was assessed by measuring the do concentration in the tap water at various inlet water velocities tap water was passed through the pre filter and then the hollow fiber module under vacuum and then the water remaining in the hollow fiber module was drained out the do concentrations in the initial water and the drained water were continuously measured with the do meter the following conditions were used to extract do from the water samples 1 the velocity of water entering the hollow fiber modules ranged from 0 1 to 1 1 l min 2 the water temperature ranged from 17 to 27 c 3 the pressure in the hollow fibers was maintained at less than 0 01 mpa we also determined the efficiency of 222rn extraction by a combination of several hollow fibers with a vacuum pumps at various inlet water velocities to determine the extraction efficiency at various contact times between the groundwater and the hollow fiber for this purpose groundwater samples containing about 300 bq l of 222rn were collected in stainless bottles at a depth of 300 m at the test site see section 2 4 and the samples were transported to a laboratory at the central research institute of electric power industry the samples were placed in a metal canister and then pumped through the devices v 7 and v 8 at flow velocities between 0 28 and 0 43 l min the initial water and drain water were collected in glass vials and the 222rn concentrations were measured the 222rn was detected with a portable radon in air monitor equipped with a stripping chamber for degassing by flushing burnett et al 2001 dimova et al 2009 details regarding the measurement of 222rn with a portable radon in air monitor have been described by burnett et al 2001 2 3 3 extraction of do with the hollow fiber from water with various salinities tap water was collected from abiko city and seawater was collected at izu oshima island the pacific ocean the salinity of the water samples

samples entered the hollow fiber modules was 0 5 l min 2 tap water seawater and mixtures of tap water and seawater ec range 0 02 50 ms cm were used as samples and 3 do was extracted at a hollow fiber pressure of 0 01 mpa the do concentrations in the initial water and the drain water were directly measured with a do meter 2 4 extraction of noble gases at the mizunami underground research laboratory testing site 2 4 1 extraction of noble gases he ne ar kr and xe we performed degassing experiments at the mizunami underground research laboratory fig 2 at this site the bedrock is granite hasegawa et al 2016 and the groundwater conductivity ranges from 31 to 247 ms m a research gallery is located at a depth of 500 m below ground level and there are four sub stages at depths of 200 300 400 and 500 m at each sub stage there is an approximately 100 m long downward pointing borehole for monitoring groundwater and each borehole is separated into six isolated sections by means of hydraulic packers mizuno et al 2013 munemoto et al 2014 a valve equipped teflon tube was connected to each interval section which allowed us to obtain water samples from the isolated intervals between the packers at each sub stage samples of groundwater were collected at depth of 500 m 15mi52 int1 and 15mi53 int5 on 25 january 2017 with the v 2 device and on 11 july 2017 with the v 7 device the dissolved gases were extracted from the groundwater with the v 2 and v 7 devices and any residual noble gases in the water that drained out of the hollow fiber were sampled in a copper tube after the groundwater and the drain water were collected in the copper tube both sides of the tube were pinched off with steel clamps to avoid contamination from air the noble gases he ne ar kr and xe were extracted at three different gas cylinder pressures for the v 2 device 0 21 0 34 and 0 63 mpa at these pressures the corresponding pressures in the hollow fiber were 0 041 0 046 and 0 056 mpa respectively the gas cylinder pressure was 0 106 mpa when the noble gases were collected from groundwater with the v 7 device noble gases were extracted from the water samples collected in copper tubes through separation line equipped with a trapping system an ultrasonic vibrator and a vacuum pump system noble gas concentrations were measured with a noble gas mass spectrometer vg5400 he a quadrupole mass spectrometer ne ar kr and xe and a cryostat apparatus matsumoto et al 2017 on 25 january 2017 we also sampled groundwater from 15mi52 int1 to measure noble gas concentrations ph ec hydrogen and oxygen stable isotope ratios δd and δ18o and alkalinity as well as the concentrations of eight dissolved major ions na k ca2 mg2 cl so4 2 no3 f and 13 dissolved trace elements si b sr li al fe mn br i as se rb ba the major ion and trace element concentrations were measured by means of ion chromatography ic881 metrohm co japan and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry 7500 ce agilent japan respectively the δd and δ18o values were measured by means of isotope ratio mass spectrometry at los gatos research san jose ca usa and iso prime gv instruments manchester uk respectively and are relative to the vienna standard mean ocean water standard values coplen et al 2002 the analytical precision of δd was 0 5 and that of δ18o was 0 1 2 4 2 extraction and measurement of 222rn in the field tests groundwater under high hydropressure 3 4 mpa was connected directly to the v 2 and the v 7 devices the initial water and drain water were collected in 100 ml glass bottles and or in 200 or 500 ml stainless steel containers on 24 january 2017 we obtained 16 samples from 15mi52 int1 and five samples from 15mi53 int5 with the v 2 device and on 11 july 2017 we obtained 22 samples from 15mi53 int5 with the v 7 device we also measured the pressure in the hollow fiber with the vacuum gauge p1 and the pressure in the gas cylinder with the compound pressure gauge p2 fig 1a b because 222rn has a short half life 3 8 days and many samples were collected during the field tests we measured 222rn concentrations with a portable radon in air monitor and a γ ray spectrometer 222rn concentrations in the initial water and drain water in the stainless containers and glass bottles were directly measured with a high purity ge detector with 40 relative efficiency and a multichannel analyzer with a high voltage circuit and a pulse height analyzer seiko co japan the radioactive concentration of 222rn was determined on the basis of the 352 kev γ rays emitted by the daughter radionuclide 214pb details on the measurement of 222rn by means of γ ray spectrometry have been described by sato et al 1980 and the procedure for calibration of γ ray has been described in detail by ohta et al 2012 3 results 3 1 estimating the rate of contamination by modern air during gas extraction we determined the relative concentrations of ch4 n2 co2 h2 and o2 collected from deep groundwater at four sites table 2 and we estimated the modern air contamination rate for these samples from the o2 concentration the o2 concentrations in gases extracted with the hollow fiber based devices 3 samples as well as by means of the water replacement method 2 samples were below the detection limit the modern air contamination rates determined by means of the two methods were almost the same however for one sample extracted with the v 7 device o2 was detected at a low concentration corresponding a modern air contamination rate of 0 044 3 2 relationships between hollow fiber pressure gas cylinder pressure and do extraction efficiency the efficiency of gas extraction effe by the hollow fiber was calculated with the following equation eff e 1 c e c 0 e where e designates the gas e do he ne ar kr xe or 222rn c 0e is the initial concentration of the gas in the sample water before extraction and c e is the concentration of the gas in the drain water we then evaluated the relationships between gas cylinder and hollow fiber pressures and between do extraction efficiency and hollow fiber pressure for the v 7 and v 2 devices fig 3 for both devices gas cylinder pressure increased with increasing hollow fiber pressure and do extraction efficiency decreased with increasing hollow fiber pressure note in particular that gas cylinder pressure increased sharply at hollow fiber pressures of 0 02 mpa and do extraction efficiency decreased sharply with increasing hollow fiber pressure analysis of these relationships indicates that extraction of the dissolved gases with these two devices would be optimal at hollow fiber pressures up to 0 02 mpa 3 3 dependence of do and 222rn extraction efficiencies on groundwater contact time and salinity the surface areas and lengths of the hollow fibers differed for the three different devices that we used and therefore the contact times between the groundwater and the outer surfaces of the hollow fibers also differed we estimated the contact time by means of the following equation ct v v where v is the volume of the hollow fiber m3 and v is the apparent velocity of the groundwater passing through the hollow fiber module m3 s for all three devices we evaluated the effect of contact time on do extraction efficiency in a laboratory experiment and found that efficiency decreased with decreasing contact time fig 4 a the differences in do extraction efficiency between the three devices were extremely small at contact times of 60 700 s the do extraction efficiency remained constant at nearly 1 0 whereas it decreased with decreasing contact time at contact times of 60 s these results indicate that the optimal contact time was 60 700 s in contrast the efficiency of 222rn extraction by the v 7 device ranged from 0 77 to 0 94 in a laboratory experiment and from 0 70 to 0 92 in a field test in both cases the contact time ranged from 53 to 364 s fig 4b at any given contact time the rn extraction efficiency was lower than the do extraction efficiency we also determined whether extraction efficiency depended on the salinity of the sample water as indicated by its electrical conductivity fig 5 shows the variation of the efficiency of do extraction by the v 2 device from tap water seawater and mixtures of seawater and tap water in equilibrium with the atmosphere almost 100 of do could be separated from the tap water the seawater and the mixtures indicating that extraction efficiency was independent of salinity at levels as high as that of seawater the results shown in fig 5 suggest that the extraction behavior of do from seawater would be the same as that from tap water for all three devices 3 4 efficiencies of he ne ar kr xe and rn extraction in field tests we conducted field tests with water samples collected at the mizunami underground research laboratory table 3 lists the physicochemical properties water pressure ph oxidation reduction potential ec do water temperature gas water ratio and 222rn concentration of water collected at a depth of 500 m at two sites at the laboratory and table 4 lists the ionic and isotopic characteristics of water collected at one of the two sites we investigated the relationships between the diffusion coefficients of the noble gases dissolved in groundwater 25 c and the efficiencies of gas extraction by the v 2 device fig 6 a c and the v 7 device fig 6d at four different gas cylinder pressures the pressures are absolute pressures we found that the extraction efficiency decreased as the magnitude of the diffusion coefficient decreased and that extraction efficiency decreased with increasing gas cylinder pressure with the v 2 device at 0 21 and 0 34 mpa the extraction efficiencies were respectively 0 993 and 0 995 for he 0 96 and 0 85 for ne 0 89 to 0 92 for ar 0 87 and 0 88 for kr 0 80 and 0 83 for xe and 0 77 and 0 70 for 222rn at a gas cylinder pressure of 0 63 mpa fig 6c the extraction efficiencies of all the gases were lower than the corresponding efficiencies at a pressure of 0 34 mpa the extraction efficiencies with the v 7 device were comparable to those with the v 2 device fig 6d the efficiency of kr extraction was 80 90 when the gas cylinder pressure was 0 21 or 0 34 mpa for the v 2 device and when the pressure was 0 11 mpa for the v 7 device we also investigated the correlation between hollow fiber pressure and the efficiencies of extraction of both 222rn and kr from deep groundwater with the v 2 device fig 7 a for both 222rn and kr extraction efficiency decreased with increasing hollow fiber pressure and the kr extraction efficiency was higher than that of 222rn at the same pressure we also evaluated the effect of hollow fiber pressure on the efficiency of 222rn extraction with the v 7 device fig 7b the efficiency was nearly constant at 0 9 at pressures of less than 0 02 mpa but at 0 02 mpa efficiency decreased with increasing pressure 4 discussion 4 1 use of 222rn extraction efficiency as an indicator for kr extraction efficiency by the hollow fiber based devices and optimization of conditions for kr extraction 4 1 1 relationship between kr and 222rn extraction efficiencies we propose that 222rn which like kr is a noble gas and which is a short half life radionuclide in the uranium series can be used as an indicator of kr extraction efficiency 222rn is ubiquitous in deep groundwater andrews 1986 andrews 1989 furthermore because 222rn has a higher molecular weight and a smaller diffusion coefficient than kr extraction from groundwater with a hollow fiber is harder for 222rn than for kr we confirmed that 222rn was an excellent indicator for extraction of kr from deep groundwater by means of our hollow fiber based devices at a test site with granite bedrock the 222rn extraction efficiency was lower than the extraction efficiencies of the other noble gases evaluated in this study the extraction efficiency of the noble gases decreased with increasing molecular weight the diffusion coefficients of dissolved he ne kr xe and 222rn in water at 25 c are 7 28 10 9 4 03 10 9 1 84 10 9 1 47 10 9 and 1 33 10 9 m2 s respectively jahne et al 1987 that is 222rn has the lowest diffusion coefficient we found that the efficiency of noble gas extraction from deep groundwater increased as the magnitude of the diffusion coefficient increased fig 6 the efficiency of 222rn extraction from deep groundwater ranged from 60 to 80 in the field test fig 7a and was 10 15 smaller than that of kr as shown in fig 6a b and fig 7a owing to the larger size and smaller diffusion coefficient of the former these results indicate that 222rn extraction efficiency would serve as a conservative estimate of kr extraction efficiency and we could estimate the in situ extraction efficiency kr from the 222rn extraction efficiency 4 1 2 optimization of hollow fiber pressure for kr extraction at gas cylinder pressures of 0 21 and 0 34 mpa the he extraction efficiency was almost 100 fig 6a b and the kr extraction efficiency was about 90 at a pressure of 0 63 mpa the efficiencies dropped to 80 and 70 respectively fig 6c that is extraction efficiency depended on gas cylinder pressure as shown in fig 3 as the pressure in the exhaust line increased the vacuum intensity inside the hollow fiber increased fig 3 these results for he and kr are consistent with the observed relationships between gas cylinder pressure hollow fiber pressure and do extraction efficiency indicating that the optimal hollow fiber pressure was 0 02 mpa fig 7a shows the effect of hollow fiber pressure on the extraction efficiencies of kr and 222rn at a contact time of 90 120 s the variation of the 222rn extraction efficiency with the two pressures was in line with that of kr as shown in fig 7b a hollow fiber pressure of less than 0 02 mpa would be suitable for both kr and 222rn 4 1 3 optimization of hollow fiber contact time for kr extraction the diffusion coefficient of dissolved o2 in water at 25 c is 2 10 10 9 m2 s the diffusion coefficient for the o2 is higher than that for the 222rn at a hollow fiber contact time of about 250 s the 222rn extraction efficiency was 20 less than that of do fig 4b this result suggests that noble gases with higher molecular weights and smaller diffusion coefficients required longer contact times than noble gases with lower molecular weights and larger diffusion coefficients because kr extraction efficiency would be 10 15 higher than that of 222rn we predict that contact times ranging from 250 to 700 s will result in kr extraction efficiencies of greater than 90 at hollow fiber pressures of less than 0 02 mpa furthermore comparing the plots in panels a and b of fig 4 shows that at each contact time the slope of the plot for do in nearly zero at all contact time 80 90 s whereas the slope is nonzero for all points on the plot for 222rn this difference in slope suggests that the decrease in 222rn extraction efficiency with contact time was larger than that for do extraction efficiency the rates of the reductions in the extraction efficiencies of 222rn and do depended on the magnitudes of their diffusion coefficients because 222rn extraction efficiency is a conservative indicator of kr extraction efficiency fig 7a we suggest that a contact time of more than 400 s would be effective for extracting nearly 100 of kr the groundwater flow rates corresponding to 400 s of contact time were 0 1 l min for hf 3 and 0 5 l min for hf 2 table 1 4 2 groundwater age based on 81kr kr ratio in gas samples accompanied by modern air although the influence of terrigenic 81kr on the 81kr kr sample ratio might affect groundwater dating in a uranium rich rock formation the magnitude of this effect has not been adequately quantified therefore only contamination by modern air is discussed here contamination by modern air would be apparent from the 85kr kr ratio in the sample gerber et al 2017 however it is rather difficult to determine 85kr with lls or atta because machine time with atta is especially limited we propose a simple approach to evaluate contamination by modern air as an alternative to an estimate derived from a 85kr kr measurement made with atta or lls because dissolved o2 in deep groundwater is consumed by oxidation organic matter degradation and other reactions contamination by modern air during the gas extraction process can be estimated from o2 concentrations that is any detectable o2 in the collected gas samples can be assumed to derive mainly from leakage of modern air into the device so 81kr contamination due to modern air can be estimated from the o2 concentration in the sample the contamination by kr from modern air can be estimated by assuming that the relative concentrations of kr are equal in the collected gases and in air we can estimate the contamination ratio from the total volume of modern air in all the gases extracted from 100 l of groundwater because groundwater age estimated by the 81kr dating method depends on the 81kr kr sample ratio in the sample water and the initial 81kr kr initial of total kr including the excess air trapped during the recharging process the presence of modern air in the collected gas sample will lead to an underestimation of the actual groundwater age although 81kr dates based on measured 81kr kr values can be affected by several factors e g device leaks sampling conditions effect of drilling water well condition and long term environmental variations we defined the contamination factor cf as follows c f kr 81 kr sample kr 81 kr initial where 81kr kr sample and 81kr kr initial are the 81kr kr ratios for the sample and in the air during the recharging period respectively here 81kr kr initial is the ratio of the decay corrected value to the simulated sample age if we assume that 81kr kr in the air has been constant since 1 ma and that production of 81kr underground is negligible the 81kr kr initial value for groundwater depends only on the residence time of the groundwater in this study we used a 81kr kr initial value of 5 2 10 13 collon et al 1997 a 81kr kr sample varies with the groundwater residence time and the volume of modern air contamination derived mainly from device leakage and sampling conditions the value of 81kr kr sample can be determined by means of the following equation kr 81 kr sample kr g 81 eff e kr a 81 kr g eff e kr a where 81krg effe 81kra krg and kra are the volume of 81kr in 100 l of groundwater the efficiency of kr extraction by the hollow fiber system the volume of 81kr derived from modern air the volume of kr dissolved in 100 l of groundwater and the volume of kr derived from modern air respectively the value of 81krg varies with groundwater residence time in this study we used 8 1 10 5 cm3 at a pressure of 1 atm a temperature of 15 c for the solubility of kr ozima and podosek 1983 and 42 10 18 cm3 at a pressure of 1 atm a temperature of 15 c for the 81kr solubility in contrast kra is a variable furthermore if we assume that 81kr kr in excess air is the same as 81kr kr dissolved in the groundwater cf will be constant regardless of how much excess air is present in the groundwater because cf varies with groundwater residence time volume of leakage derived modern air and effe we calculated cf for effe values of 100 90 80 and 50 and modern air volumes of 0 01 0 03 0 5 0 1 and 1 l the estimated variations of cf with groundwater residence time at the specified volumes and effe values are plotted in fig 8 the plots indicate that cf increased with increasing residence time and decreased with increasing efficiency of kr extraction from groundwater by the hollow fiber system the 81kr method is used for dating groundwater from 0 02 ma to 1 ma but contamination is a more critical problem for older groundwater dating to 1 ma than for younger groundwater because the 81kr concentration in old groundwater is lower than that in young groundwater contamination with only 0 03 l of modern air results in a larger cf for old groundwater than for young groundwater when we assumed that the volume of modern air was 0 03 l kr extraction efficiencies of 100 90 80 and 50 for a groundwater age of 1 ma gave cf values of 1 08 1 09 1 10 and 1 16 respectively that is the cf values increased with decreasing kr extraction efficiency therefore high efficiency kr extraction is required for preventing the 81kr kr ratio for groundwater from being influenced by the 81kr kr ratio for modern air furthermore our measurements of o2 contamination indicate that the highest value for contamination of the hollow fiber system by modern air was 0 044 table 2 which corresponds to 6 ml of air in 14 l of gas this indicates that cf was highest 1 02 for a groundwater age of 1 ma a cf value of 1 02 results in an error of only 0 005 ma for a groundwater age of 1 ma for comparison the use of atta for 5 15 μl of kr collected from groundwater gives an error of 10 20 jiang et al 2012 therefore the cf value reported herein for our method fully ignore the value for groundwater age estimated by 81kr because we are currently focusing on using our device for collecting 81kr from deep groundwater which has low permeability hydraulic conductivity ranging from 10 7 to 10 11 m s the velocity of the water circulating in the gas collecting device has to be consistent with the low flow of groundwater in situ and the long contact time between the hollow fiber and the groundwater as described in section 4 1 when the contact time was longer than 250 s and the pressure inside the hollow fiber was less than 0 02 mpa the efficiency of kr extraction from the groundwater was more than 90 as shown in the cf residence time plot in fig 8b the kr extraction efficiency exceeded 90 and less than 6 ml of modern air leaked into the extraction system in the range of the kr extraction efficiencies obtained from the results of this study our system could be used to extract kr from old groundwater up to 1 ma as long as the cf was less than 1 02 5 conclusions we conclude that the optimal conditions for extracting kr from deep groundwater with a hollow fiber are as follows 1 pressure less than 0 02 mpa in the hollow fiber and 2 contact time more than 250 s the devices described herein demonstrated an ultra low level of contamination by 81kr from modern air in particular 81kr contamination was negligible for groundwater dating to 1 ma the optimal device could be used to date groundwater at a site being considered for geological disposal of radioactive waste such a site would need to be characterized by a low flow rate of groundwater and low hydraulic conductivity an in situ test of kr extraction from deep groundwater revealed that the efficiency of 222rn extraction from the groundwater was a suitable indicator of kr extraction efficiency the new indicator can be applied to either deep or shallow groundwater because the uranium series can be found anywhere acknowledgments this work was

6448,groundwater dating information is important for safety assessment for geological disposal of high level radioactive waste radiokrypton 81kr is an excellent tracer for dating old groundwater with a residence time up to 1 ma we have optimized a hollow fiber based device for extracting 81kr from deep groundwater with low hydraulic conductivity for the purpose of estimating its residence time such a device must show a high kr extraction efficiency and an ultra low level of contamination from modern air and must allow for in situ evaluation of kr extraction efficiency the optimal devices reported herein showed minimal contamination by 81kr from modern air and the efficiency of kr extraction from high salinity groundwater exceeded 90 furthermore we confirmed that the 222rn was a suitable indicator of kr extraction efficiency keywords radiokrypton deep groundwater hollow fiber 222rn radioactive waste disposal 1 introduction groundwater immobility is required for safe disposal of high level radioactive waste in deep geological repositories estimating the mobility of any radioactive nuclide that might leach from buried waste requires knowledge of the groundwater flow in the bedrock where the repositories will be constructed assessment of whether disposal of radioactive waste in a geological repository is safe requires knowledge of the groundwater residence time which is one of the most important factors needed to estimate groundwater mobility an excellent way to determine groundwater mobility is to compare the residence time of the groundwater with the date of sedimentation of the basement rocks that make up the basin mahara et al 2012 2013 nakata et al 2018 the most appropriate method of dating groundwater is measurement of its 81kr concentration atoms l because in groundwater the only source of most of the dissolved 81kr half life 0 229 ma which is chemically inert is cosmic ray spallation in the upper atmosphere recently it has been possible to measure 81kr by using the atom trap trace analysis atta method lu et al 2014 jiang et al 2012 the method probably determines the residence time to within 1 ma lehmann et al 1991 2003 du et al 2003 collon et al 2000 aggarwal et al 2015 aeschbach hertig et al 2014 sturchio et al 2004 lu et al 2014 matsumoto et al 2018 purtschert et al 2013 gerber et al 2017 in this study we precisely extracted under high vacuum a tiny amount of radiokrypton from the groundwater seeping through the very low permeability geological environment surrounding the repository the groundwater flowing condition which we target wolud be 1 l min our study required development of the technology to extract radiokrypton from slowly moving groundwater without contamination from modern atmospheric krypton the development of efficient portable devices for on site extraction of dissolved kr from large amounts of groundwater was crucial to the long term in situ extraction operation radioisotopes of kr 81kr and 85kr have recently been extracted from large amounts of groundwater via hollow fiber systems probst et al 2007 ohta et al 2009 yokochi 2016 this method effectively extracts all dissolved gases from large amounts of groundwater we used this method to successfully extract radiokrypton at high hydrostatic pressure 4 mpa from water with a high salinity 35 or higher without contamination from modern air which must be minimized for accurate estimation of groundwater residence times via 81kr dating we therefore used a suitable indicator to evaluate the extent of in situ contamination by kr from modern air that contamination resulted mainly from leakage of air and from mixing of groundwater with drilling water during the boring operation we have previously hypothesized that dissolved co2 and 222rn another noble gas might be suitable indicators of the efficiency of 81kr extraction from deep groundwater ohta et al 2009 and we evaluated that hypothesis in this study our goals were to design a portable device that could efficiently extract sufficient amounts of kr from 100 l of deep groundwater in situ with negligible contamination by 81kr from modern air under high pressure high salinity conditions in this study we describe the development of a new hollow fiber system that can be operated in an impermeable geo environment the 222rn extraction efficiency served as an indicator of kr extraction efficiency 2 material and methods 2 1 design of devices we have designed and tested three types of hollow fiber based devices designated v 2 v 7 and v 8 for extracting kr from deep groundwater fig 1 these devices consist of three main parts a system for extracting gas from the groundwater a system for transporting the extracted gas and a cylinder for collecting the gas the specifications of the vacuum pumps and the hollow fiber modules used in the three devices are listed in table 1 the hollow fibers were composed of poly 4 methyl pentene 1 and the hollow fiber modules were of the external pressure type that is the groundwater was in contact with the outer surface of the fiber and a vacuum was applied from inside the fiber in this type of system the water flow on the outer surface of the fiber is turbulent so a boundary layer is usually not produced as is the case for internal pressure type systems and therefore the extraction efficiency is improved by an increase in the gas permeation rate the pre filter and the hollow fiber modules were housed in a tank of water to prevent kr in modern air from entering from the outer surfaces of the modules water is a simple excellent barrier to the intrusion of modern air 2 2 leakage assessment using atmospheric o2 to check for leakage of modern air into the system via the surfaces of three of the vacuum pumps vp 2 vp 3 and vp 4 table 1 we determined the volume of leaking modern air by means of a water replacement method after pumping briefly the inlet of each vacuum pump was sealed with a metal cap line blind valve the outlet of the pump was fitted with a teflon tube and the open end of the tube was immersed in 3 l of water in a glass bottle which was inverted and placed in a 5 l plastic beaker over the course of 12 h no visible leaks were observed in any of the three tested vacuum pumps furthermore we used the presence of oxygen in deep groundwater as an indicator of contamination by kr from modern air because air contains 20 9 oxygen whereas oxygen is usually not present in deep groundwater the v 7 and v 8 devices were used to extract gases from deep groundwater samples collected at depths of 214 250 613 and 943 m the oxygen concentrations in the collected gases were measured to check for the presence of kr derived from modern air the major dissolved gases ch4 o2 co2 n2 and h2 in the deep groundwater were collected by means of a water replacement system wr and a hollow fiber system hf and were collected into a metallic gas cylinder and or an aluminum bag the ch4 o2 co2 n2 and h2 concentrations were measured by means of gas chromatography on an instrument agilent 490 micro gas chromatograph agilent japan equipped with a cycle pump unit cp2900 agilent japan 2 3 laboratory tests 2 3 1 measurement of the pressure in the hollow fiber the pressure in the gas cylinder and the dissolved oxygen concentration in the drain water the optimal pressures in the hollow fiber and the gas cylinder were determined by means of a laboratory experiment involving tap water collected at the central research institute of the electric power industry chiba japan a tap water sample was first pumped though a 5 μm pore size pre filter and then through the hollow fiber module under vacuum gas dissolved in the sample was extracted via the inner surface of the fiber under vacuum and then drained out of the module via the outlet fig 1a b the dissolved oxygen do concentrations in the initial sample water before the pre filter and in the drained water were continuously measured with a do meter horiba co japan we measured the pressure in the hollow fiber by means of a vacuum gauge and the pressure in the gas cylinder by means of a compound pressure gauge p1 and p2 respectively fig 1a b the water velocity at the inlet of the devices was measured with a total flow meter llw 05 ttn horiba co japan 2 3 2 extraction of do and 222rn with the hollow fiber based devices at various contact times the efficiency of gas extraction by the devices v 2 v 7 and v 8 was assessed by measuring the do concentration in the tap water at various inlet water velocities tap water was passed through the pre filter and then the hollow fiber module under vacuum and then the water remaining in the hollow fiber module was drained out the do concentrations in the initial water and the drained water were continuously measured with the do meter the following conditions were used to extract do from the water samples 1 the velocity of water entering the hollow fiber modules ranged from 0 1 to 1 1 l min 2 the water temperature ranged from 17 to 27 c 3 the pressure in the hollow fibers was maintained at less than 0 01 mpa we also determined the efficiency of 222rn extraction by a combination of several hollow fibers with a vacuum pumps at various inlet water velocities to determine the extraction efficiency at various contact times between the groundwater and the hollow fiber for this purpose groundwater samples containing about 300 bq l of 222rn were collected in stainless bottles at a depth of 300 m at the test site see section 2 4 and the samples were transported to a laboratory at the central research institute of electric power industry the samples were placed in a metal canister and then pumped through the devices v 7 and v 8 at flow velocities between 0 28 and 0 43 l min the initial water and drain water were collected in glass vials and the 222rn concentrations were measured the 222rn was detected with a portable radon in air monitor equipped with a stripping chamber for degassing by flushing burnett et al 2001 dimova et al 2009 details regarding the measurement of 222rn with a portable radon in air monitor have been described by burnett et al 2001 2 3 3 extraction of do with the hollow fiber from water with various salinities tap water was collected from abiko city and seawater was collected at izu oshima island the pacific ocean the salinity of the water samples was measured with an electric conductivity ec meter ec meter horiba japan do was extracted from the water samples with the v 2 device under the following conditions 1 the flow rate at which the water samples entered the hollow fiber modules was 0 5 l min 2 tap water seawater and mixtures of tap water and seawater ec range 0 02 50 ms cm were used as samples and 3 do was extracted at a hollow fiber pressure of 0 01 mpa the do concentrations in the initial water and the drain water were directly measured with a do meter 2 4 extraction of noble gases at the mizunami underground research laboratory testing site 2 4 1 extraction of noble gases he ne ar kr and xe we performed degassing experiments at the mizunami underground research laboratory fig 2 at this site the bedrock is granite hasegawa et al 2016 and the groundwater conductivity ranges from 31 to 247 ms m a research gallery is located at a depth of 500 m below ground level and there are four sub stages at depths of 200 300 400 and 500 m at each sub stage there is an approximately 100 m long downward pointing borehole for monitoring groundwater and each borehole is separated into six isolated sections by means of hydraulic packers mizuno et al 2013 munemoto et al 2014 a valve equipped teflon tube was connected to each interval section which allowed us to obtain water samples from the isolated intervals between the packers at each sub stage samples of groundwater were collected at depth of 500 m 15mi52 int1 and 15mi53 int5 on 25 january 2017 with the v 2 device and on 11 july 2017 with the v 7 device the dissolved gases were extracted from the groundwater with the v 2 and v 7 devices and any residual noble gases in the water that drained out of the hollow fiber were sampled in a copper tube after the groundwater and the drain water were collected in the copper tube both sides of the tube were pinched off with steel clamps to avoid contamination from air the noble gases he ne ar kr and xe were extracted at three different gas cylinder pressures for the v 2 device 0 21 0 34 and 0 63 mpa at these pressures the corresponding pressures in the hollow fiber were 0 041 0 046 and 0 056 mpa respectively the gas cylinder pressure was 0 106 mpa when the noble gases were collected from groundwater with the v 7 device noble gases were extracted from the water samples collected in copper tubes through separation line equipped with a trapping system an ultrasonic vibrator and a vacuum pump system noble gas concentrations were measured with a noble gas mass spectrometer vg5400 he a quadrupole mass spectrometer ne ar kr and xe and a cryostat apparatus matsumoto et al 2017 on 25 january 2017 we also sampled groundwater from 15mi52 int1 to measure noble gas concentrations ph ec hydrogen and oxygen stable isotope ratios δd and δ18o and alkalinity as well as the concentrations of eight dissolved major ions na k ca2 mg2 cl so4 2 no3 f and 13 dissolved trace elements si b sr li al fe mn br i as se rb ba the major ion and trace element concentrations were measured by means of ion chromatography ic881 metrohm co japan and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry 7500 ce agilent japan respectively the δd and δ18o values were measured by means of isotope ratio mass spectrometry at los gatos research san jose ca usa and iso prime gv instruments manchester uk respectively and are relative to the vienna standard mean ocean water standard values coplen et al 2002 the analytical precision of δd was 0 5 and that of δ18o was 0 1 2 4 2 extraction and measurement of 222rn in the field tests groundwater under high hydropressure 3 4 mpa was connected directly to the v 2 and the v 7 devices the initial water and drain water were collected in 100 ml glass bottles and or in 200 or 500 ml stainless steel containers on 24 january 2017 we obtained 16 samples from 15mi52 int1 and five samples from 15mi53 int5 with the v 2 device and on 11 july 2017 we obtained 22 samples from 15mi53 int5 with the v 7 device we also measured the pressure in the hollow fiber with the vacuum gauge p1 and the pressure in the gas cylinder with the compound pressure gauge p2 fig 1a b because 222rn has a short half life 3 8 days and many samples were collected during the field tests we measured 222rn concentrations with a portable radon in air monitor and a γ ray spectrometer 222rn concentrations in the initial water and drain water in the stainless containers and glass bottles were directly measured with a high purity ge detector with 40 relative efficiency and a multichannel analyzer with a high voltage circuit and a pulse height analyzer seiko co japan the radioactive concentration of 222rn was determined on the basis of the 352 kev γ rays emitted by the daughter radionuclide 214pb details on the measurement of 222rn by means of γ ray spectrometry have been described by sato et al 1980 and the procedure for calibration of γ ray has been described in detail by ohta et al 2012 3 results 3 1 estimating the rate of contamination by modern air during gas extraction we determined the relative concentrations of ch4 n2 co2 h2 and o2 collected from deep groundwater at four sites table 2 and we estimated the modern air contamination rate for these samples from the o2 concentration the o2 concentrations in gases extracted with the hollow fiber based devices 3 samples as well as by means of the water replacement method 2 samples were below the detection limit the modern air contamination rates determined by means of the two methods were almost the same however for one sample extracted with the v 7 device o2 was detected at a low concentration corresponding a modern air contamination rate of 0 044 3 2 relationships between hollow fiber pressure gas cylinder pressure and do extraction efficiency the efficiency of gas extraction effe by the hollow fiber was calculated with the following equation eff e 1 c e c 0 e where e designates the gas e do he ne ar kr xe or 222rn c 0e is the initial concentration of the gas in the sample water before extraction and c e is the concentration of the gas in the drain water we then evaluated the relationships between gas cylinder and hollow fiber pressures and between do extraction efficiency and hollow fiber pressure for the v 7 and v 2 devices fig 3 for both devices gas cylinder pressure increased with increasing hollow fiber pressure and do extraction efficiency decreased with increasing hollow fiber pressure note in particular that gas cylinder pressure increased sharply at hollow fiber pressures of 0 02 mpa and do extraction efficiency decreased sharply with increasing hollow fiber pressure analysis of these relationships indicates that extraction of the dissolved gases with these two devices would be optimal at hollow fiber pressures up to 0 02 mpa 3 3 dependence of do and 222rn extraction efficiencies on groundwater contact time and salinity the surface areas and lengths of the hollow fibers differed for the three different devices that we used and therefore the contact times between the groundwater and the outer surfaces of the hollow fibers also differed we estimated the contact time by means of the following equation ct v v where v is the volume of the hollow fiber m3 and v is the apparent velocity of the groundwater passing through the hollow fiber module m3 s for all three devices we evaluated the effect of contact time on do extraction efficiency in a laboratory experiment and found that efficiency decreased with decreasing contact time fig 4 a the differences in do extraction efficiency between the three devices were extremely small at contact times of 60 700 s the do extraction efficiency remained constant at nearly 1 0 whereas it decreased with decreasing contact time at contact times of 60 s these results indicate that the optimal contact time was 60 700 s in contrast the efficiency of 222rn extraction by the v 7 device ranged from 0 77 to 0 94 in a laboratory experiment and from 0 70 to 0 92 in a field test in both cases the contact time ranged from 53 to 364 s fig 4b at any given contact time the rn extraction efficiency was lower than the do extraction efficiency we also determined whether extraction efficiency depended on the salinity of the sample water as indicated by its electrical conductivity fig 5 shows the variation of the efficiency of do extraction by the v 2 device from tap water seawater and mixtures of seawater and tap water in equilibrium with the atmosphere almost 100 of do could be separated from the tap water the seawater and the mixtures indicating that extraction efficiency was independent of salinity at levels as high as that of seawater the results shown in fig 5 suggest that the extraction behavior of do from seawater would be the same as that from tap water for all three devices 3 4 efficiencies of he ne ar kr xe and rn extraction in field tests we conducted field tests with water samples collected at the mizunami underground research laboratory table 3 lists the physicochemical properties water pressure ph oxidation reduction potential ec do water temperature gas water ratio and 222rn concentration of water collected at a depth of 500 m at two sites at the laboratory and table 4 lists the ionic and isotopic characteristics of water collected at one of the two sites we investigated the relationships between the diffusion coefficients of the noble gases dissolved in groundwater 25 c and the efficiencies of gas extraction by the v 2 device fig 6 a c and the v 7 device fig 6d at four different gas cylinder pressures the pressures are absolute pressures we found that the extraction efficiency decreased as the magnitude of the diffusion coefficient decreased and that extraction efficiency decreased with increasing gas cylinder pressure with the v 2 device at 0 21 and 0 34 mpa the extraction efficiencies were respectively 0 993 and 0 995 for he 0 96 and 0 85 for ne 0 89 to 0 92 for ar 0 87 and 0 88 for kr 0 80 and 0 83 for xe and 0 77 and 0 70 for 222rn at a gas cylinder pressure of 0 63 mpa fig 6c the extraction efficiencies of all the gases were lower than the corresponding efficiencies at a pressure of 0 34 mpa the extraction efficiencies with the v 7 device were comparable to those with the v 2 device fig 6d the efficiency of kr extraction was 80 90 when the gas cylinder pressure was 0 21 or 0 34 mpa for the v 2 device and when the pressure was 0 11 mpa for the v 7 device we also investigated the correlation between hollow fiber pressure and the efficiencies of extraction of both 222rn and kr from deep groundwater with the v 2 device fig 7 a for both 222rn and kr extraction efficiency decreased with increasing hollow fiber pressure and the kr extraction efficiency was higher than that of 222rn at the same pressure we also evaluated the effect of hollow fiber pressure on the efficiency of 222rn extraction with the v 7 device fig 7b the efficiency was nearly constant at 0 9 at pressures of less than 0 02 mpa but at 0 02 mpa efficiency decreased with increasing pressure 4 discussion 4 1 use of 222rn extraction efficiency as an indicator for kr extraction efficiency by the hollow fiber based devices and optimization of conditions for kr extraction 4 1 1 relationship between kr and 222rn extraction efficiencies we propose that 222rn which like kr is a noble gas and which is a short half life radionuclide in the uranium series can be used as an indicator of kr extraction efficiency 222rn is ubiquitous in deep groundwater andrews 1986 andrews 1989 furthermore because 222rn has a higher molecular weight and a smaller diffusion coefficient than kr extraction from groundwater with a hollow fiber is harder for 222rn than for kr we confirmed that 222rn was an excellent indicator for extraction of kr from deep groundwater by means of our hollow fiber based devices at a test site with granite bedrock the 222rn extraction efficiency was lower than the extraction efficiencies of the other noble gases evaluated in this study the extraction efficiency of the noble gases decreased with increasing molecular weight the diffusion coefficients of dissolved he ne kr xe and 222rn in water at 25 c are 7 28 10 9 4 03 10 9 1 84 10 9 1 47 10 9 and 1 33 10 9 m2 s respectively jahne et al 1987 that is 222rn has the lowest diffusion coefficient we found that the efficiency of noble gas extraction from deep groundwater increased as the magnitude of the diffusion coefficient increased fig 6 the efficiency of 222rn extraction from deep groundwater ranged from 60 to 80 in the field test fig 7a and was 10 15 smaller than that of kr as shown in fig 6a b and fig 7a owing to the larger size and smaller diffusion coefficient of the former these results indicate that 222rn extraction efficiency would serve as a conservative estimate of kr extraction efficiency and we could estimate the in situ extraction efficiency kr from the 222rn extraction efficiency 4 1 2 optimization of hollow fiber pressure for kr extraction at gas cylinder pressures of 0 21 and 0 34 mpa the he extraction efficiency was almost 100 fig 6a b and the kr extraction efficiency was about 90 at a pressure of 0 63 mpa the efficiencies dropped to 80 and 70 respectively fig 6c that is extraction efficiency depended on gas cylinder pressure as shown in fig 3 as the pressure in the exhaust line increased the vacuum intensity inside the hollow fiber increased fig 3 these results for he and kr are consistent with the observed relationships between gas cylinder pressure hollow fiber pressure and do extraction efficiency indicating that the optimal hollow fiber pressure was 0 02 mpa fig 7a shows the effect of hollow fiber pressure on the extraction efficiencies of kr and 222rn at a contact time of 90 120 s the variation of the 222rn extraction efficiency with the two pressures was in line with that of kr as shown in fig 7b a hollow fiber pressure of less than 0 02 mpa would be suitable for both kr and 222rn 4 1 3 optimization of hollow fiber contact time for kr extraction the diffusion coefficient of dissolved o2 in water at 25 c is 2 10 10 9 m2 s the diffusion coefficient for the o2 is higher than that for the 222rn at a hollow fiber contact time of about 250 s the 222rn extraction efficiency was 20 less than that of do fig 4b this result suggests that noble gases with higher molecular weights and smaller diffusion coefficients required longer contact times than noble gases with lower molecular weights and larger diffusion coefficients because kr extraction efficiency would be 10 15 higher than that of 222rn we predict that contact times ranging from 250 to 700 s will result in kr extraction efficiencies of greater than 90 at hollow fiber pressures of less than 0 02 mpa furthermore comparing the plots in panels a and b of fig 4 shows that at each contact time the slope of the plot for do in nearly zero at all contact time 80 90 s whereas the slope is nonzero for all points on the plot for 222rn this difference in slope suggests that the decrease in 222rn extraction efficiency with contact time was larger than that for do extraction efficiency the rates of the reductions in the extraction efficiencies of 222rn and do depended on the magnitudes of their diffusion coefficients because 222rn extraction efficiency is a conservative indicator of kr extraction efficiency fig 7a we suggest that a contact time of more than 400 s would be effective for extracting nearly 100 of kr the groundwater flow rates corresponding to 400 s of contact time were 0 1 l min for hf 3 and 0 5 l min for hf 2 table 1 4 2 groundwater age based on 81kr kr ratio in gas samples accompanied by modern air although the influence of terrigenic 81kr on the 81kr kr sample ratio might affect groundwater dating in a uranium rich rock formation the magnitude of this effect has not been adequately quantified therefore only contamination by modern air is discussed here contamination by modern air would be apparent from the 85kr kr ratio in the sample gerber et al 2017 however it is rather difficult to determine 85kr with lls or atta because machine time with atta is especially limited we propose a simple approach to evaluate contamination by modern air as an alternative to an estimate derived from a 85kr kr measurement made with atta or lls because dissolved o2 in deep groundwater is consumed by oxidation organic matter degradation and other reactions contamination by modern air during the gas extraction process can be estimated from o2 concentrations that is any detectable o2 in the collected gas samples can be assumed to derive mainly from leakage of modern air into the device so 81kr contamination due to modern air can be estimated from the o2 concentration in the sample the contamination by kr from modern air can be estimated by assuming that the relative concentrations of kr are equal in the collected gases and in air we can estimate the contamination ratio from the total volume of modern air in all the gases extracted from 100 l of groundwater because groundwater age estimated by the 81kr dating method depends on the 81kr kr sample ratio in the sample water and the initial 81kr kr initial of total kr including the excess air trapped during the recharging process the presence of modern air in the collected gas sample will lead to an underestimation of the actual groundwater age although 81kr dates based on measured 81kr kr values can be affected by several factors e g device leaks sampling conditions effect of drilling water well condition and long term environmental variations we defined the contamination factor cf as follows c f kr 81 kr sample kr 81 kr initial where 81kr kr sample and 81kr kr initial are the 81kr kr ratios for the sample and in the air during the recharging period respectively here 81kr kr initial is the ratio of the decay corrected value to the simulated sample age if we assume that 81kr kr in the air has been constant since 1 ma and that production of 81kr underground is negligible the 81kr kr initial value for groundwater depends only on the residence time of the groundwater in this study we used a 81kr kr initial value of 5 2 10 13 collon et al 1997 a 81kr kr sample varies with the groundwater residence time and the volume of modern air contamination derived mainly from device leakage and sampling conditions the value of 81kr kr sample can be determined by means of the following equation kr 81 kr sample kr g 81 eff e kr a 81 kr g eff e kr a where 81krg effe 81kra krg and kra are the volume of 81kr in 100 l of groundwater the efficiency of kr extraction by the hollow fiber system the volume of 81kr derived from modern air the volume of kr dissolved in 100 l of groundwater and the volume of kr derived from modern air respectively the value of 81krg varies with groundwater residence time in this study we used 8 1 10 5 cm3 at a pressure of 1 atm a temperature of 15 c for the solubility of kr ozima and podosek 1983 and 42 10 18 cm3 at a pressure of 1 atm a temperature of 15 c for the 81kr solubility in contrast kra is a variable furthermore if we assume that 81kr kr in excess air is the same as 81kr kr dissolved in the groundwater cf will be constant regardless of how much excess air is present in the groundwater because cf varies with groundwater residence time volume of leakage derived modern air and effe we calculated cf for effe values of 100 90 80 and 50 and modern air volumes of 0 01 0 03 0 5 0 1 and 1 l the estimated variations of cf with groundwater residence time at the specified volumes and effe values are plotted in fig 8 the plots indicate that cf increased with increasing residence time and decreased with increasing efficiency of kr extraction from groundwater by the hollow fiber system the 81kr method is used for dating groundwater from 0 02 ma to 1 ma but contamination is a more critical problem for older groundwater dating to 1 ma than for younger groundwater because the 81kr concentration in old groundwater is lower than that in young groundwater contamination with only 0 03 l of modern air results in a larger cf for old groundwater than for young groundwater when we assumed that the volume of modern air was 0 03 l kr extraction efficiencies of 100 90 80 and 50 for a groundwater age of 1 ma gave cf values of 1 08 1 09 1 10 and 1 16 respectively that is the cf values increased with decreasing kr extraction efficiency therefore high efficiency kr extraction is required for preventing the 81kr kr ratio for groundwater from being influenced by the 81kr kr ratio for modern air furthermore our measurements of o2 contamination indicate that the highest value for contamination of the hollow fiber system by modern air was 0 044 table 2 which corresponds to 6 ml of air in 14 l of gas this indicates that cf was highest 1 02 for a groundwater age of 1 ma a cf value of 1 02 results in an error of only 0 005 ma for a groundwater age of 1 ma for comparison the use of atta for 5 15 μl of kr collected from groundwater gives an error of 10 20 jiang et al 2012 therefore the cf value reported herein for our method fully ignore the value for groundwater age estimated by 81kr because we are currently focusing on using our device for collecting 81kr from deep groundwater which has low permeability hydraulic conductivity ranging from 10 7 to 10 11 m s the velocity of the water circulating in the gas collecting device has to be consistent with the low flow of groundwater in situ and the long contact time between the hollow fiber and the groundwater as described in section 4 1 when the contact time was longer than 250 s and the pressure inside the hollow fiber was less than 0 02 mpa the efficiency of kr extraction from the groundwater was more than 90 as shown in the cf residence time plot in fig 8b the kr extraction efficiency exceeded 90 and less than 6 ml of modern air leaked into the extraction system in the range of the kr extraction efficiencies obtained from the results of this study our system could be used to extract kr from old groundwater up to 1 ma as long as the cf was less than 1 02 5 conclusions we conclude that the optimal conditions for extracting kr from deep groundwater with a hollow fiber are as follows 1 pressure less than 0 02 mpa in the hollow fiber and 2 contact time more than 250 s the devices described herein demonstrated an ultra low level of contamination by 81kr from modern air in particular 81kr contamination was negligible for groundwater dating to 1 ma the optimal device could be used to date groundwater at a site being considered for geological disposal of radioactive waste such a site would need to be characterized by a low flow rate of groundwater and low hydraulic conductivity an in situ test of kr extraction from deep groundwater revealed that the efficiency of 222rn extraction from the groundwater was a suitable indicator of kr extraction efficiency the new indicator can be applied to either deep or shallow groundwater because the uranium series can be found anywhere acknowledgments this work was

6449,the 2015 chennai india flood event claimed many lives and incurred an economic loss of 2 2 billion simulation of such a destructive flood event in an ever growing urban sprawl and changing climate is of great importance for better flood preparedness and management of the city in that light this study aims to a study the 2015 chennai flood event and b simulate the occurrence of a similar event in future considering both urban sprawl and increased rainfall resulting from climate change effects the baseline scenario is generated using freely available hydrologic hec hms hydraulic hec ras models and the results are validated with observed flood mark data historical land use and land cover maps of the study area are used to train an artificial neural network model for constructing spatially varying urban sprawl scenarios the hydrologic model is run for the increased rainfall and urban sprawl scenarios to generate flood hydrographs which are then used as inputs to the hydraulic model for simulating possible flood inundation patterns the simulations indicate that the average increase in inundation extent considering the worst possible urban sprawl solely and that taken together with extreme rainfall are 20 and 33 percent respectively furthermore the analysis shows that on an average 1 7 times more number of buildings are exposed to flood hazard under the worst case combined scenario in comparison to the baseline scenario this study therefore demonstrates the importance of considering urban sprawl in addition to changes in rainfall for evaluating the worst possible consequences of flooding of a city considering the uncertainties involved in the study the presented results may be considered as what if scenarios for planning suitable flood mitigation measures for the city of chennai keywords urban sprawl climate change ann hydrologic hydraulic modeling open source data chennai flood 2015 1 introduction floods are natural phenomena that arise as a result of heavy precipitation currently in the urban areas of developing countries where there is a dearth of stringent regulations on planning significant flooding may occur even for short bursts of high intensity precipitation the loss of natural flood storage and drainage due to the encroachment of wetlands floodplains and water bodies has drastically altered the drainage characteristics consequently floods have become frequent events in many cities gupta and nair 2010 suriya and mudgal 2012 in addition the study by schafer and victor 2000 shows that by 2030 the urban population in the world may increase by 175 an increasing trend in migration from rural to urban areas is leading to an uncontrolled and rapid expansion of cities in developing nations the resulting infrastructure buildup and increase in impervious areas inhibit infiltration of rainwater and reduce frictional resistance to the overland flow this in turn exacerbates the runoff processes and the risk of flooding nirupama and simonovic 2007 saghafian et al 2008 olang and fürst 2011 furthermore the increase in temperature resulting from climate change is likely to increase the intensity of heavy precipitation events in urban areas wasko and sharma 2017 as a consequence low lying coastal cities are becoming increasingly vulnerable to pluvial and fluvial flooding under these circumstances flood inundation mapping and demarcating risk zones based on possible depths of inundation and associated damage levels are expected to aid in improving flood management city planning and policy implementation for urban agglomerations zope et al 2016 therefore for long term planning it is indispensable to bring out the impact of both urban sprawl and climate change in intensifying the city s flood hazard recent studies on indian cities like chennai suriya et al 2012 suriya and mudgal 2012 mumbai kulkarni et al 2014 zope et al 2015 zope et al 2016 and pune wagner et al 2016 conclude that either the projected climate change or land use change is likely to result in increased runoff in the future however the above studies have not considered the combined effects of climate change and urban sprawl on flooding therefore in this study the flood inundation mapping and zoning for what if type urbanization and climate change scenarios are investigated using publicly available data for the rapidly urbanizing but ungauged adyar river basin the adyar river basin comprises the south west portion of chennai a megacity in southern india the city has a mean elevation of around 6 m nrsc isro 2015 and borders the indian ocean along its eastern edge during high tides the drainage system becomes ineffective escalating the probability of flooding sivakholundu 2010 the city is also experiencing rapid urbanization leading to unregulated settlements on the flood plains wetlands and water bodies bunch 2000 gupta and nair 2010 suriya et al 2012 singh and arrighi 2017 the resulting land use change coupled with the projected increase in frequency and intensity of extreme rainfall is likely to make the city highly vulnerable to flooding in order to generate possible flooding scenarios for the city suitable models for predicting urban sprawl and flood inundation are required the generated scenarios may be useful in regulating the future expansion of the city thereby reducing the risk of loss of human life and damage to property modeling the highly dynamic and non linear urban expansion process which involves identifying and evaluating the drivers including political economic environmental biophysical cultural and institutional factors is a challenging task basse et al 2014 hence often non linear approaches like cellular automata ca divigalpitiya et al 2007 mubea et al 2014 artificial neural network ann maithani 2009 tayyebi and pijanowski 2014 pijanowski et al 2014 or their combinations basse et al 2014 li and li 2015 yang et al 2016 are employed to capture dynamic spatial patterns of land use the ca framework discretizes the domain into cells and each cell is attributed to a particular state from a finite set of states the states in a neighborhood represent local interactions a set of transition rules govern state changes of each cell and the changes are updated with each time step for the combined approach of ca and ann ann is implemented in defining transitional rules for the ca in order to efficiently model land use changes basse et al 2014 li and li 2015 yang et al 2016 pijanowski et al 2014 have developed an ann model to simulate land use and land cover lulc change patterns at continental scales of 30 m spatial resolution tayyebi and pijanowski 2014 applied ann to predict urban agriculture and forest land use classes in se wisconsin time interval 1990 2000 and muskegon river watershed usa time interval 1978 1998 they also proved that the ann model performs better in comparison to other statistical data mining tools namely classification regression trees and multivariate adaptive regression splines the major advantages of ann are the ease of use and its ability to model complex and non linear processes therefore in this study an ann model is chosen to artificially construct possible urban sprawl scenarios in 2030 considering the uniqueness of the study area the designed ann model is simple and it requires fewer parameters as inputs and all of them can be derived from publicly available data to bring out the impact of climate change effect on extreme rainfall events guhathakurta et al 2011 analyzed long term trends for rain gauge stations located all over india for the period 1901 2005 from the published results it can be noticed that nearly 10 15 increase in one day extreme rainfall is observed in 100 years for the chennai region it can be inferred from the study by rao et al 2014 that by 2080 the extreme rainfall is likely to increase by 30 40 with respect to 1961 1990 over the study area in this study rainfall data from global climate models gcms namely australian community climate and earth system simulator access community climate system model ccsm centre national de recherches météorologiques cnrm and max planck institute mpi are selected for analysing the trend in extreme rainfall the rainfall data from the gcms that are downscaled using regional climate model rcm conformal cubic atmospheric models ccam for the reference period 2006 2040 is obtained from coordinated regional downscaling experiment cordex for south asia portal http cccr tropmet res in home cordexsa datasets jsp a 13 5 increase in precipitation from 2015 to 2030 is observed for the study area when a linear trend is fitted on the annual maximum daily rainfall series these findings reiterate that in future there will be an evident increase in flood risk in the study area due to rapid urbanization and increase in rainfall as projected in the aforementioned climate change studies however as mentioned earlier research on evaluating the impact of both urbanization and increased rainfall on futuristic flood inundation and hazard mapping is still at its infancy in india especially for the city of chennai thus the objectives of the present study are framed as follows i to construct likely urban sprawl patterns by 2030 for the city of chennai using ann ii to carry out flood simulations using freely available hydrologic hydraulic models considering projected urban sprawl and rainfall scenarios and iii to prepare flood inundation maps and analyze flood hazard zones for different rainfall and urban sprawl scenarios the importance of this study lies in the fact that the combined influence of climate change and urban expansion in flood hazard zoning is brought out also flood hazard maps are essential in urban expansion planning and management to reduce the loss of life and property 2 study area description the adyar river basin chosen as the study area is shown in fig 1 the upper portion of the study area is chiefly populated by shrubs and water bodies while the lower reaches form a part of the chennai metropolitan area cma it should be noted that the cma is already a heavily built up area and hence only the upper portion of the catchment is experiencing rapid urban expansion the ann and the hydrologic models are set up for the entire adyar basin whereas the hydraulic model is established from the location where the river enters the cma boundary to the point where it outfalls into the sea fig 1 the hydrological model therefore generates runoff that effectively takes into account the changes in urbanization within the watershed the hydraulic model captures the impact of urbanization in the upper portion of the study area on the flooding potential of the downstream region comprising cma the total length of river adyar is about 43 km of which 12 2 km is within the city limits the river within the cma has two branches the upper arm coming from the chembarambakkam sub basin while the lower arm flows out from thiruneermalai the river remains dry for most of the year with flows largely occurring during the north east ne monsoon the adyar river makes its entry into the city at the nandambakkam bridge and flows through the cma before falling into the bay of bengal the cma experiences a tropical wet and dry climate with high humidity the city receives an average annual rainfall of about 1400 mm it receives most of the annual rainfall of about 800 mm during the ne monsoon period from mid october to mid december importantly the city relies on this seasonal rainfall to fill up the water bodies and reservoirs which meets most of the city s annual freshwater supplies the region is also susceptible to cyclones and depressions originating in the bay of bengal during the ne monsoon period coupled with the intense precipitation at this time of the year other factors such as the city s low lying terrain inefficient local drainage pathways poorly maintained river and sand bar formation at the river mouth hamper the drainage of floodwaters resulting in recurrent massive floods the city had experienced major floods in 1976 1985 1996 1998 2005 2008 2015 and 2017 monsoon seasons 3 methodology the 2015 chennai flood event is selected for analysis herein as the daily precipitation of 494 mm falling on dec 1st was the heaviest in the past hundred years in the region narasimhan et al 2016 fig 2 shows the overall framework used in this study to prepare flood hazard zones for the 2015 flood event and similar extreme events which may occur by 2030 but with projected land use and rainfall scenarios the framework consists of the following six components i lulc classification ii scenario definition iii urban sprawl prediction iv rainfall runoff modeling v flood inundation mapping and vi determination of flood hazard zones for likely urban sprawl and rainfall scenarios the lulc classification component comprises of creating historical lulc maps there is nearly 2 fold increase in the urban area during the period 2002 2017 table 1 moreover a study by bharath et al 2017 which used a ca based model to predict urban growth in chennai reports that there can be about 1 96 times increase in urban areas by 2025 in comparison to that of 2013 also the study by padmanaban et al 2017 points out that there could be an increase in urban areas of cma and a 10 km suburban buffer by 1 22 times by 2027 when compared to 2016 these studies considered a span of less than 15 years of prediction and also the spatial extent did not include the entire adyar river basin the basin consists of not only the south west portion of cma but also some parts of thiruvallur and kanchipuram districts which were not considered in the reported studies considering these findings and the uncertainty involved in predicting the urban sprawl 1 5 2 0 and 2 5 times increase in urban areas are selected in this study for future flood simulations the analysis of cordex south asia rcm experiments one day maximum rainfall data shows about 13 5 increase during 2015 30 however this analysis doesn t consider any rigorous bias correction of the rcm data due to the lack of publicly available data therefore there is a high uncertainty associated with the assumption of a 13 5 rainfall increase in the annual maximum rainfall hence the rainfall is scaled up in the range of 5 to 20 for generating probable future rainfall scenarios though this range of variations in rainfall may not necessarily represent the actual climate change cc impact on rainfall pattern it may be assumed to be representative of the likely changes in rainfall in the future by 2030 for the study region based on the information mentioned above the future scenarios are defined as given in table 2 two broad categories of scenarios are considered here a what could be the future flood inundation extent considering only the expansion of urban area without cc that is without variations in rainfall and b what could be the flood inundation extent considering both urban expansion and cc since 10 increase in rainfall by 2030 is a likely scenario rao et al 2014 the same is combined with 1 5 2 5 times increase in urban sprawl for carrying out flood simulations on the other hand 5 15 and 20 increases in rainfall are combined with only the 2 5 times increase in urban area to generate the worst case scenarios this is done with a view to reduce the length of the paper the historical lulc maps obtained from lulc classification are used in the urban sprawl prediction component to train an ann model the trained model is then used to simulate the probable future lulc scenarios in 2030 next the rainfall runoff modeling component is employed to estimate runoff hydrographs for the aforementioned scenarios using the predicted lulc maps and the scaled up rainfall the runoff hydrographs are then extracted at nandambakkam bridge on the adyar river where it enters the cma the runoff hydrographs are further utilized in the flood inundation mapping component to simulate flood depths and extents for various scenarios finally the flood hazard zones are delineated based on critical inundation depths suriya et al 2012 nrsc isro 2015 to facilitate easy estimation of the associated economic loss it may be noteworthy to mention that the framework has been devised to effectively make use of publicly available data and freely available hydrologic hydraulic models for flood hazard zone mapping 3 1 lulc classification the publicly available landsat 7 and landsat 8 satellite images are acquired for the dates 28 06 2002 and 25 03 2017 respectively an unsupervised classification is performed on the images of 30 m spatial resolution using the google earth as a reference eventually six different lulc categories namely water trees plantation urban agricultural land barren and shrubland are generated fig 3 table 1 represents the percentage of each lulc category in the years 2002 and 2017 the generated lulc maps are then used in training the ann model and constructing the future urban sprawl scenarios 3 2 urban sprawl scenario in this study the possible urban sprawl scenarios are formulated and used in the hydrological model to develop boundary conditions for the hydraulic model which in turn simulates flood inundation extents a feed forward ann network fig 4 in which the information moves forward from input to output neurons through hidden layers is used in this study a single hidden layer is used and the number of neurons in the hidden layer is varied between 1 and 50 a hidden layer with 10 neurons gave better results in terms of coefficient of determination r2 upon performing validation with the unused training data in the training process weights and biases related to the association of inputs to hidden layer neurons are adjusted till there is no significant reduction in the mean square error between the simulated and the target values the output is modeled as a function of the weighted sum of the inputs and addition of biases the inputs that are chosen for the ann model are elevation distance to the coast distance to the nearby road and the number of agriculture barren shrub forest urban and water pixels in 15 15 pixels 450 m 450 m window based on the lulc for the year 2002 the road network is obtained from the open street map osm data available at http www openstreetmap org fig 5 a all the inputs are normalized and scaled between 0 and 1 the window size is varied from 300 m to 1000 m the size of 450 m is found to give reasonably better results in terms of r2 upon performing validation of the unused training data from table 1 it can be seen that apart from urban spaces and water bodies the other classes exhibit a decline during the period 2002 2017 the increase in the area occupied by water bodies may be attributed to the variations in precipitation as the imageries were taken in dry and wet periods thus it makes sense to model the expansion of urban areas alone to represent the lulc in the future hence the target vector consists of 0s for non urban areas and 1s for urban areas for the year 2017 upon validation using 25 of the randomly selected and unused training data an r2 value of 0 61 is obtained the ann toolbox available in matlab 2016a version is used in this process the trained ann model used inputs corresponding to the year 2017 to simulate possible future scenarios of urban sprawl the output vector from the trained ann model consists of 0s and 1s from the output vector the future scenarios can be obtained by varying the acceptable thresholds that define urban areas for each scenario the threshold is chosen for each scenario such that there is a corresponding increase in the urban areas by factors of 1 5 2 0 and 2 5 these factors are chosen based on historical growth rate and the findings reported in previous studies bharath et al 2017 padmanaban et al 2017 the possible future scenarios that are artificially constructed for 2030 are shown in fig 5b the constructed urban sprawl areas are then incorporated into the hydrologic model to generate flood hydrographs at the inlet of the adyar river that in turn serve as the upstream boundary conditions for flood simulations under various possible scenarios an inherent assumption in the urban sprawl modeling is that the historical urban growth pattern holds true for the future and varies within the assumed range which can be prone to some amount of uncertainty 3 3 rainfall runoff modeling the study uses hec hms usace 2000 to simulate the runoff response for the 2015 and possible extreme events by 2030 when the hydrological and meteorological data are not extensive hec hms model has often been preferred in comparison to other hydrological models suriya and mudgal 2012 hec hms requires digital elevation model dem precipitation lulc and soil data as inputs dem in the present case is obtained from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm data repository currently the srtm 30 m 30 m resolution is the best publicly available dem data for the study area apart from being freely available the srtm dem data is a reliable alternative in the absence of very high resolution data schumann et al 2008 using a stream burned srtm dem data the study area is delineated into 13 sub basins so as to obtain a more realistic stream network the soil conservation service scs curve number cn method is chosen for estimating the losses occurring in the basin higher cn signifies very less infiltration loss cn values vary based on land use and hydrologic soil group hsg the hsg data is prepared using the fao soil data available at https swat tamu edu software india dataset the cn maps for the baseline and future scenarios are generated using hsg and lulc information as given in table 3 kumar et al 1991 from the cn method the precipitation excess of infiltration loss is estimated for each sub basin the scs unit hydrograph with the lag parameter is used to transform rainfall into direct runoff hydrograph the lag parameter is estimated as a function of the user specified values of cn length and slope of sub basins following this the routing component is used to compute the hydrograph at the downstream for the given upstream direct runoff hydrograph the kinematic wave routing model is chosen here and the required input parameters are obtained from the dem data the rainfall from the meenambakam rain gauge situated in the hydrological domain is used in the simulation of 2015 flood fig 6 a the inflows into chembarambakkam reservoir as reported in narasimhan et al 2016 is used for model validation upon comparison fig 6b with the observed flow values r2 and nash sutcliffe values of 0 7 and 0 61 are obtained respectively as the flow data at the outlet of the hydrologic domain is not available the hec hms is validated against the reservoir inflow data the hec hms setup for the baseline differs from that of the future scenarios in terms of inputs namely precipitation and cn for the scenarios with urban expansion alone 1 5 2 0 and 2 5 the predicted urban sprawl maps are used to obtain different cn values for the sub basins while for the scenario considering increased rainfall alone that is baseline cc10 the rainfall corresponding to the 2015 chennai flood is scaled up throughout by 10 in the case of scenarios with both urban expansion and increased rainfall the cn values are varied according to the simulated increase in urban sprawl and the precipitation is also scaled up in accordance with table 2 the hec hms model is set up for various scenarios and then run for the period 1st november to 14th december 2015 the baseline runoff hydrograph generated by the hec hms model at the upstream hydraulic boundary of adyar river is shown in fig 7 the peak flow is 3296 m3 s which is much higher than the flow carrying capacity 2038 m3 s of the river however in the case of combined scenario 2 5 cc20 the peak flow scales up by 40 5 and reaches 4629 8 m3 s table 4 presents the flood peaks for baseline and other scenarios hence it can be clearly seen that under the combined influence of urban sprawl and increased rainfall the flood damage will be more extensive in comparison to the worst case urban sprawl only scenario 3 4 flood inundation mapping flood inundation extent and depths corresponding to the baseline and the future flood scenarios are simulated using the widely used logah et al 2017 moya quiroga et al 2016 and freely available two dimensional 2d hydraulic model hec ras usace 2016 the hydraulic domain fig 1 is discretized into computational cells of size 30 m 30 m since the srtm data for the river mouth area is not available the freely available general bathymetric chart of the oceans gebco data is used to fill up the no data pixels the pixels that correspond to buildings osm data are raised to about 5 m from the existing terrain data in an effort to make the flood hazard zoning more realistic the srtm data can be used with confidence for modeling high magnitude infrequent floods if the purpose of the study is not aligned towards detailed analysis like the design of hydraulic structures yan et al 2014 the hec ras can solve either 2d diffusive wave equations or full 2d saint venant equations for the 2015 chennai flood event the computing time for full 2d solution is 4 5 cpu time greater than that of diffusive wave solution however the difference in inundation extents simulated by the two solution schemes is found to be only 4 therefore in order to reduce the computation cost the 2d diffusive wave equation option is resorted to the runoff hydrographs obtained from the hec hms are used as upstream boundary conditions for the hec ras model the locations and the data pertaining to the upstream boundary conditions for the baseline scenario are indicated in figs 1 and 7 respectively the tidal data narasimhan et al 2016 is given as the downstream boundary condition at the river mouth suriya and mudgal 2012 used manning s n values of 0 025 m 1 3 s for 1976 and 0 03 m 1 3 s for 1985 floods however the 2015 chennai flood was a result of both fluvial and pluvial flooding the urban areas were flooded not only due to overflowing rivers but also due to lack of efficient drainage of the stormwater it is thus difficult to separate fluvial and pluvial flooding extents and calibrate manning s n value hence in this study all the scenarios are run for the manning s n values of 0 025 0 03 0 035 and 0 04 m 1 3 s to take care of the uncertainty associated with the friction coefficient in the simulated results the simulations are run with a stable and convergent time step of 6 s in order to validate the baseline simulation the flood marks surveyed soon after the 2015 chennai flood are used fig 8 the computed water depths are used to prepare flood inundation maps and a threshold water depth of 0 1 m is used to differentiate between dry and wet areas from fig 9 it can be seen that the range of manning s n values chosen for the study provides almost similar accuracy with respect to the r2 values however the simulations show different inundation patterns for different values of n the possible reason for getting similar r2 values may be due to the fact that all the surveyed points are located close to the adyar river moreover in the absence of an observed inundation extent map a single n value can introduce more uncertainty in the results hence all the results are reported in the form of a range for different values of n and scenarios however in a few cases the results are reported only for n 0 035 m 1 3 s to reduce the length of the paper 4 results and discussion fig 10 shows the simulated inundation extents for various scenarios that are run with a manning s n value of 0 035 m 1 3 s since the scenarios are run for different manning s n values the ranges of inundation extents and the average percentage increase in inundation area for various scenarios with respect to the baseline scenario are provided in table 4 the total inundation area seems to increase from about 30 8 38 6 km2 for the baseline to about 37 4 47 1 km2 21 5 22 for the worst case urban sprawl only scenario 2 5 the combined worst case urban sprawl and increased rainfall scenario magnify the inundation extent further by about 41 3 51 7 km2 that is an increase of 33 8 34 3 with respect to the baseline scenario the results indicate that the combined effect of urban sprawl and increased rainfall scenarios produce more inundation in comparison to the urban sprawl only situation the inundation extents are analyzed further to derive flood hazard maps the hazard zones are classified into four categories such as low moderate high and very high depending on the critical depths of inundation 0 1 0 6 1 4 and 3 5 m as given in table 5 according to suriya et al 2012 an inundation depth of 0 6 m causes floodwaters to enter house premises after inflicting damage to their gardens and garages and an additional increase in inundation depth is likely to cause considerable loss to residents in its report on the 2015 chennai flood nrsc isro 2015 indicates that for an inundation depth of about 1 4 m all the furniture and appliances placed on the floor gets submerged at a depth of about 3 5 m the ground floor gets completely submerged and floodwaters start rising above the level of the ground floor based on the above classification the inundation extents under different zones are computed for all the scenarios a summary of which is presented in table 6 it can be seen that for the 2 5 cc20 scenario the inundation areas under all the hazard zones except for the low hazard category have increased significantly when compared to both the baseline and urban sprawl only 2 5 scenarios this can be attributed to the increase in both flood depth and inundation extent under the combined scenario as the cma constitutes the hydraulic domain the number of buildings within the various hazard zones for different scenarios are calculated and plotted in fig 11 a box plot is provided to get a clear picture of the range and the average number of buildings that may be affected under different combinations of hazard zones and scenarios for a manning s n value of 0 035 m 1 3 s the number of buildings affected under low moderate high and very high hazard categories for the combined worst case scenario 2 5 cc20 is seen to increase by 68 61 72 and 65 respectively in comparison to the baseline scenario fig 11 shows that there is a consistent increase in the number of buildings counted in different hazard zones on moving from baseline to the 2 5 cc20 scenario these estimates based on osm data give an idea on the extent of flood damage that is likely to occur in the what if scenarios additionally the maximum inundation depths at important locations in the cma for various scenarios are summarized in table 7 places like anna nagar kotturpuram and gandhi nagar are the worst affected in all the scenarios as they are closer to the river from table 7 it can be seen that an increasing trend is observed from baseline to the worst case scenario similar inferences are also reported for the 2005 and 2015 floods by narasimhan et al 2016 the above analysis reiterates the importance of considering both urban sprawl and increased rainfall while delineating flood hazard zones for the future it may be emphasized that the results from these what if scenarios may be considered as indicators and not taken directly as future projections for 2030 however when more confirmed information on climate change projection and urban sprawl is available the results could be used for strategy planning of flood management for the region 5 summary and conclusions in this study the catastrophic 2015 chennai flood event is simulated using hydrologic hec hms hydraulic hec ras 2d modeling system the simulated results are validated with reservoir inflow and surveyed flood mark data considering this flood event as a baseline analysis on flood inundation and hazard zones for the occurrence of a similar extreme event in the future is carried out for the possible urban sprawl by 2030 and likely change in rainfall scenario given the rapid urbanization of the city an ann model is designed for constructing the spatially varying future urban sprawl scenarios the observed 2015 extreme rainfall event is scaled up by 5 20 to account for climate change effect for the same region two distinct sets of scenarios are generated considering a urban sprawl only and b both urban sprawl and scaled up rainfall to represent the likely influence of climate change from the analysis of various scenarios it can be concluded that the percentage increase in inundation extent for the worst case scenarios of urban sprawl only 2 5 and its combination with increased rainfall 2 5 cc20 cases are 21 5 22 and 33 8 34 3 respectively such a significant change in inundation is alarming for a metropolitan city like chennai as the associated damages would also increase accordingly under the worst case combined scenario the areas under all the hazard zones are seen to have increased when compared to both the baseline and urban sprawl only scenarios it is also found that on an average around 1 7 times more buildings are exposed to the hazard of flooding under the combined scenario 2 5 cc20 in comparison to the baseline scenario it can therefore be concluded that for a rapidly expanding city like chennai the combined effect of urban sprawl and climate change poses a severe challenge in preparing flood maps and hazard zones the evident increase in inundation extent calls for careful planning of urban expansion litter management conservation of the existing water bodies and improvement in the existing drainage system the study is carried out using freely available models and openly accessible data therefore the proposed methodology can be easily adopted for sites having limited field data it gives an idea of the flood hazard associated with the 2015 chennai flood the most intense in the past hundred years like scenarios the results should be considered as what if scenarios without limiting them to a definite time span for instance the results from urban sprawl only scenarios 1 5 2 0 and 2 5 help in understanding the increase in flood inundation and hazard for 1 5 2 0 and 2 5 times increase in urban areas with respect to the existing conditions while the scenarios 1 5 cc10 2 0 cc10 2 5 cc5 2 5 cc10 2 5 cc15 and 2 5 cc20 point to the disastrous consequences of different combinations of increased rainfall and urban sprawl scenarios the development and spread of urban sprawl at the upper portion of the study area therefore need careful regulation moreover a diversion channel from the upper catchment bypassing the city to the ocean may help in reducing flood damages in the future however a complete flood risk assessment involves identifying the probability of occurrence and the damage associated with various magnitudes of floods incorporation of flood risk into urban development and preparedness planning will help increase the resilience of the city s flood protection system the influence of urbanization induced local microclimate and sea level rise on flooding is not investigated in this study and hence presents new avenues for future research furthermore damage assessment from both pluvial and fluvial floods

6449,the 2015 chennai india flood event claimed many lives and incurred an economic loss of 2 2 billion simulation of such a destructive flood event in an ever growing urban sprawl and changing climate is of great importance for better flood preparedness and management of the city in that light this study aims to a study the 2015 chennai flood event and b simulate the occurrence of a similar event in future considering both urban sprawl and increased rainfall resulting from climate change effects the baseline scenario is generated using freely available hydrologic hec hms hydraulic hec ras models and the results are validated with observed flood mark data historical land use and land cover maps of the study area are used to train an artificial neural network model for constructing spatially varying urban sprawl scenarios the hydrologic model is run for the increased rainfall and urban sprawl scenarios to generate flood hydrographs which are then used as inputs to the hydraulic model for simulating possible flood inundation patterns the simulations indicate that the average increase in inundation extent considering the worst possible urban sprawl solely and that taken together with extreme rainfall are 20 and 33 percent respectively furthermore the analysis shows that on an average 1 7 times more number of buildings are exposed to flood hazard under the worst case combined scenario in comparison to the baseline scenario this study therefore demonstrates the importance of considering urban sprawl in addition to changes in rainfall for evaluating the worst possible consequences of flooding of a city considering the uncertainties involved in the study the presented results may be considered as what if scenarios for planning suitable flood mitigation measures for the city of chennai keywords urban sprawl climate change ann hydrologic hydraulic modeling open source data chennai flood 2015 1 introduction floods are natural phenomena that arise as a result of heavy precipitation currently in the urban areas of developing countries where there is a dearth of stringent regulations on planning significant flooding may occur even for short bursts of high intensity precipitation the loss of natural flood storage and drainage due to the encroachment of wetlands floodplains and water bodies has drastically altered the drainage characteristics consequently floods have become frequent events in many cities gupta and nair 2010 suriya and mudgal 2012 in addition the study by schafer and victor 2000 shows that by 2030 the urban population in the world may increase by 175 an increasing trend in migration from rural to urban areas is leading to an uncontrolled and rapid expansion of cities in developing nations the resulting infrastructure buildup and increase in impervious areas inhibit infiltration of rainwater and reduce frictional resistance to the overland flow this in turn exacerbates the runoff processes and the risk of flooding nirupama and simonovic 2007 saghafian et al 2008 olang and fürst 2011 furthermore the increase in temperature resulting from climate change is likely to increase the intensity of heavy precipitation events in urban areas wasko and sharma 2017 as a consequence low lying coastal cities are becoming increasingly vulnerable to pluvial and fluvial flooding under these circumstances flood inundation mapping and demarcating risk zones based on possible depths of inundation and associated damage levels are expected to aid in improving flood management city planning and policy implementation for urban agglomerations zope et al 2016 therefore for long term planning it is indispensable to bring out the impact of both urban sprawl and climate change in intensifying the city s flood hazard recent studies on indian cities like chennai suriya et al 2012 suriya and mudgal 2012 mumbai kulkarni et al 2014 zope et al 2015 zope et al 2016 and pune wagner et al 2016 conclude that either the projected climate change or land use change is likely to result in increased runoff in the future however the above studies have not considered the combined effects of climate change and urban sprawl on flooding therefore in this study the flood inundation mapping and zoning for what if type urbanization and climate change scenarios are investigated using publicly available data for the rapidly urbanizing but ungauged adyar river basin the adyar river basin comprises the south west portion of chennai a megacity in southern india the city has a mean elevation of around 6 m nrsc isro 2015 and borders the indian ocean along its eastern edge during high tides the drainage system becomes ineffective escalating the probability of flooding sivakholundu 2010 the city is also experiencing rapid urbanization leading to unregulated settlements on the flood plains wetlands and water bodies bunch 2000 gupta and nair 2010 suriya et al 2012 singh and arrighi 2017 the resulting land use change coupled with the projected increase in frequency and intensity of extreme rainfall is likely to make the city highly vulnerable to flooding in order to generate possible flooding scenarios for the city suitable models for predicting urban sprawl and flood inundation are required the generated scenarios may be useful in regulating the future expansion of the city thereby reducing the risk of loss of human life and damage to property modeling the highly dynamic and non linear urban expansion process which involves identifying and evaluating the drivers including political economic environmental biophysical cultural and institutional factors is a challenging task basse et al 2014 hence often non linear approaches like cellular automata ca divigalpitiya et al 2007 mubea et al 2014 artificial neural network ann maithani 2009 tayyebi and pijanowski 2014 pijanowski et al 2014 or their combinations basse et al 2014 li and li 2015 yang et al 2016 are employed to capture dynamic spatial patterns of land use the ca framework discretizes the domain into cells and each cell is attributed to a particular state from a finite set of states the states in a neighborhood represent local interactions a set of transition rules govern state changes of each cell and the changes are updated with each time step for the combined approach of ca and ann ann is implemented in defining transitional rules for the ca in order to efficiently model land use changes basse et al 2014 li and li 2015 yang et al 2016 pijanowski et al 2014 have developed an ann model to simulate land use and land cover lulc change patterns at continental scales of 30 m spatial resolution tayyebi and pijanowski 2014 applied ann to predict urban agriculture and forest land use classes in se wisconsin time interval 1990 2000 and muskegon river watershed usa time interval 1978 1998 they also proved that the ann model performs better in comparison to other statistical data mining tools namely classification regression trees and multivariate adaptive regression splines the major advantages of ann are the ease of use and its ability to model complex and non linear processes therefore in this study an ann model is chosen to artificially construct possible urban sprawl scenarios in 2030 considering the uniqueness of the study area the designed ann model is simple and it requires fewer parameters as inputs and all of them can be derived from publicly available data to bring out the impact of climate change effect on extreme rainfall events guhathakurta et al 2011 analyzed long term trends for rain gauge stations located all over india for the period 1901 2005 from the published results it can be noticed that nearly 10 15 increase in one day extreme rainfall is observed in 100 years for the chennai region it can be inferred from the study by rao et al 2014 that by 2080 the extreme rainfall is likely to increase by 30 40 with respect to 1961 1990 over the study area in this study rainfall data from global climate models gcms namely australian community climate and earth system simulator access community climate system model ccsm centre national de recherches météorologiques cnrm and max planck institute mpi are selected for analysing the trend in extreme rainfall the rainfall data from the gcms that are downscaled using regional climate model rcm conformal cubic atmospheric models ccam for the reference period 2006 2040 is obtained from coordinated regional downscaling experiment cordex for south asia portal http cccr tropmet res in home cordexsa datasets jsp a 13 5 increase in precipitation from 2015 to 2030 is observed for the study area when a linear trend is fitted on the annual maximum daily rainfall series these findings reiterate that in future there will be an evident increase in flood risk in the study area due to rapid urbanization and increase in rainfall as projected in the aforementioned climate change studies however as mentioned earlier research on evaluating the impact of both urbanization and increased rainfall on futuristic flood inundation and hazard mapping is still at its infancy in india especially for the city of chennai thus the objectives of the present study are framed as follows i to construct likely urban sprawl patterns by 2030 for the city of chennai using ann ii to carry out flood simulations using freely available hydrologic hydraulic models considering projected urban sprawl and rainfall scenarios and iii to prepare flood inundation maps and analyze flood hazard zones for different rainfall and urban sprawl scenarios the importance of this study lies in the fact that the combined influence of climate change and urban expansion in flood hazard zoning is brought out also flood hazard maps are essential in urban expansion planning and management to reduce the loss of life and property 2 study area description the adyar river basin chosen as the study area is shown in fig 1 the upper portion of the study area is chiefly populated by shrubs and water bodies while the lower reaches form a part of the chennai metropolitan area cma it should be noted that the cma is already a heavily built up area and hence only the upper portion of the catchment is experiencing rapid urban expansion the ann and the hydrologic models are set up for the entire adyar basin whereas the hydraulic model is established from the location where the river enters the cma boundary to the point where it outfalls into the sea fig 1 the hydrological model therefore generates runoff that effectively takes into account the changes in urbanization within the watershed the hydraulic model captures the impact of urbanization in the upper portion of the study area on the flooding potential of the downstream region comprising cma the total length of river adyar is about 43 km of which 12 2 km is within the city limits the river within the cma has two branches the upper arm coming from the chembarambakkam sub basin while the lower arm flows out from thiruneermalai the river remains dry for most of the year with flows largely occurring during the north east ne monsoon the adyar river makes its entry into the city at the nandambakkam bridge and flows through the cma before falling into the bay of bengal the cma experiences a tropical wet and dry climate with high humidity the city receives an average annual rainfall of about 1400 mm it receives most of the annual rainfall of about 800 mm during the ne monsoon period from mid october to mid december importantly the city relies on this seasonal rainfall to fill up the water bodies and reservoirs which meets most of the city s annual freshwater supplies the region is also susceptible to cyclones and depressions originating in the bay of bengal during the ne monsoon period coupled with the intense precipitation at this time of the year other factors such as the city s low lying terrain inefficient local drainage pathways poorly maintained river and sand bar formation at the river mouth hamper the drainage of floodwaters resulting in recurrent massive floods the city had experienced major floods in 1976 1985 1996 1998 2005 2008 2015 and 2017 monsoon seasons 3 methodology the 2015 chennai flood event is selected for analysis herein as the daily precipitation of 494 mm falling on dec 1st was the heaviest in the past hundred years in the region narasimhan et al 2016 fig 2 shows the overall framework used in this study to prepare flood hazard zones for the 2015 flood event and similar extreme events which may occur by 2030 but with projected land use and rainfall scenarios the framework consists of the following six components i lulc classification ii scenario definition iii urban sprawl prediction iv rainfall runoff modeling v flood inundation mapping and vi determination of flood hazard zones for likely urban sprawl and rainfall scenarios the lulc classification component comprises of creating historical lulc maps there is nearly 2 fold increase in the urban area during the period 2002 2017 table 1 moreover a study by bharath et al 2017 which used a ca based model to predict urban growth in chennai reports that there can be about 1 96 times increase in urban areas by 2025 in comparison to that of 2013 also the study by padmanaban et al 2017 points out that there could be an increase in urban areas of cma and a 10 km suburban buffer by 1 22 times by 2027 when compared to 2016 these studies considered a span of less than 15 years of prediction and also the spatial extent did not include the entire adyar river basin the basin consists of not only the south west portion of cma but also some parts of thiruvallur and kanchipuram districts which were not considered in the reported studies considering these findings and the uncertainty involved in predicting the urban sprawl 1 5 2 0 and 2 5 times increase in urban areas are selected in this study for future flood simulations the analysis of cordex south asia rcm experiments one day maximum rainfall data shows about 13 5 increase during 2015 30 however this analysis doesn t consider any rigorous bias correction of the rcm data due to the lack of publicly available data therefore there is a high uncertainty associated with the assumption of a 13 5 rainfall increase in the annual maximum rainfall hence the rainfall is scaled up in the range of 5 to 20 for generating probable future rainfall scenarios though this range of variations in rainfall may not necessarily represent the actual climate change cc impact on rainfall pattern it may be assumed to be representative of the likely changes in rainfall in the future by 2030 for the study region based on the information mentioned above the future scenarios are defined as given in table 2 two broad categories of scenarios are considered here a what could be the future flood inundation extent considering only the expansion of urban area without cc that is without variations in rainfall and b what could be the flood inundation extent considering both urban expansion and cc since 10 increase in rainfall by 2030 is a likely scenario rao et al 2014 the same is combined with 1 5 2 5 times increase in urban sprawl for carrying out flood simulations on the other hand 5 15 and 20 increases in rainfall are combined with only the 2 5 times increase in urban area to generate the worst case scenarios this is done with a view to reduce the length of the paper the historical lulc maps obtained from lulc classification are used in the urban sprawl prediction component to train an ann model the trained model is then used to simulate the probable future lulc scenarios in 2030 next the rainfall runoff modeling component is employed to estimate runoff hydrographs for the aforementioned scenarios using the predicted lulc maps and the scaled up rainfall the runoff hydrographs are then extracted at nandambakkam bridge on the adyar river where it enters the cma the runoff hydrographs are further utilized in the flood inundation mapping component to simulate flood depths and extents for various scenarios finally the flood hazard zones are delineated based on critical inundation depths suriya et al 2012 nrsc isro 2015 to facilitate easy estimation of the associated economic loss it may be noteworthy to mention that the framework has been devised to effectively make use of publicly available data and freely available hydrologic hydraulic models for flood hazard zone mapping 3 1 lulc classification the publicly available landsat 7 and landsat 8 satellite images are acquired for the dates 28 06 2002 and 25 03 2017 respectively an unsupervised classification is performed on the images of 30 m spatial resolution using the google earth as a reference eventually six different lulc categories namely water trees plantation urban agricultural land barren and shrubland are generated fig 3 table 1 represents the percentage of each lulc category in the years 2002 and 2017 the generated lulc maps are then used in training the ann model and constructing the future urban sprawl scenarios 3 2 urban sprawl scenario in this study the possible urban sprawl scenarios are formulated and used in the hydrological model to develop boundary conditions for the hydraulic model which in turn simulates flood inundation extents a feed forward ann network fig 4 in which the information moves forward from input to output neurons through hidden layers is used in this study a single hidden layer is used and the number of neurons in the hidden layer is varied between 1 and 50 a hidden layer with 10 neurons gave better results in terms of coefficient of determination r2 upon performing validation with the unused training data in the training process weights and biases related to the association of inputs to hidden layer neurons are adjusted till there is no significant reduction in the mean square error between the simulated and the target values the output is modeled as a function of the weighted sum of the inputs and addition of biases the inputs that are chosen for the ann model are elevation distance to the coast distance to the nearby road and the number of agriculture barren shrub forest urban and water pixels in 15 15 pixels 450 m 450 m window based on the lulc for the year 2002 the road network is obtained from the open street map osm data available at http www openstreetmap org fig 5 a all the inputs are normalized and scaled between 0 and 1 the window size is varied from 300 m to 1000 m the size of 450 m is found to give reasonably better results in terms of r2 upon performing validation of the unused training data from table 1 it can be seen that apart from urban spaces and water bodies the other classes exhibit a decline during the period 2002 2017 the increase in the area occupied by water bodies may be attributed to the variations in precipitation as the imageries were taken in dry and wet periods thus it makes sense to model the expansion of urban areas alone to represent the lulc in the future hence the target vector consists of 0s for non urban areas and 1s for urban areas for the year 2017 upon validation using 25 of the randomly selected and unused training data an r2 value of 0 61 is obtained the ann toolbox available in matlab 2016a version is used in this process the trained ann model used inputs corresponding to the year 2017 to simulate possible future scenarios of urban sprawl the output vector from the trained ann model consists of 0s and 1s from the output vector the future scenarios can be obtained by varying the acceptable thresholds that define urban areas for each scenario the threshold is chosen for each scenario such that there is a corresponding increase in the urban areas by factors of 1 5 2 0 and 2 5 these factors are chosen based on historical growth rate and the findings reported in previous studies bharath et al 2017 padmanaban et al 2017 the possible future scenarios that are artificially constructed for 2030 are shown in fig 5b the constructed urban sprawl areas are then incorporated into the hydrologic model to generate flood hydrographs at the inlet of the adyar river that in turn serve as the upstream boundary conditions for flood simulations under various possible scenarios an inherent assumption in the urban sprawl modeling is that the historical urban growth pattern holds true for the future and varies within the assumed range which can be prone to some amount of uncertainty 3 3 rainfall runoff modeling the study uses hec hms usace 2000 to simulate the runoff response for the 2015 and possible extreme events by 2030 when the hydrological and meteorological data are not extensive hec hms model has often been preferred in comparison to other hydrological models suriya and mudgal 2012 hec hms requires digital elevation model dem precipitation lulc and soil data as inputs dem in the present case is obtained from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm data repository currently the srtm 30 m 30 m resolution is the best publicly available dem data for the study area apart from being freely available the srtm dem data is a reliable alternative in the absence of very high resolution data schumann et al 2008 using a stream burned srtm dem data the study area is delineated into 13 sub basins so as to obtain a more realistic stream network the soil conservation service scs curve number cn method is chosen for estimating the losses occurring in the basin higher cn signifies very less infiltration loss cn values vary based on land use and hydrologic soil group hsg the hsg data is prepared using the fao soil data available at https swat tamu edu software india dataset the cn maps for the baseline and future scenarios are generated using hsg and lulc information as given in table 3 kumar et al 1991 from the cn method the precipitation excess of infiltration loss is estimated for each sub basin the scs unit hydrograph with the lag parameter is used to transform rainfall into direct runoff hydrograph the lag parameter is estimated as a function of the user specified values of cn length and slope of sub basins following this the routing component is used to compute the hydrograph at the downstream for the given upstream direct runoff hydrograph the kinematic wave routing model is chosen here and the required input parameters are obtained from the dem data the rainfall from the meenambakam rain gauge situated in the hydrological domain is used in the simulation of 2015 flood fig 6 a the inflows into chembarambakkam reservoir as reported in narasimhan et al 2016 is used for model validation upon comparison fig 6b with the observed flow values r2 and nash sutcliffe values of 0 7 and 0 61 are obtained respectively as the flow data at the outlet of the hydrologic domain is not available the hec hms is validated against the reservoir inflow data the hec hms setup for the baseline differs from that of the future scenarios in terms of inputs namely precipitation and cn for the scenarios with urban expansion alone 1 5 2 0 and 2 5 the predicted urban sprawl maps are used to obtain different cn values for the sub basins while for the scenario considering increased rainfall alone that is baseline cc10 the rainfall corresponding to the 2015 chennai flood is scaled up throughout by 10 in the case of scenarios with both urban expansion and increased rainfall the cn values are varied according to the simulated increase in urban sprawl and the precipitation is also scaled up in accordance with table 2 the hec hms model is set up for various scenarios and then run for the period 1st november to 14th december 2015 the baseline runoff hydrograph generated by the hec hms model at the upstream hydraulic boundary of adyar river is shown in fig 7 the peak flow is 3296 m3 s which is much higher than the flow carrying capacity 2038 m3 s of the river however in the case of combined scenario 2 5 cc20 the peak flow scales up by 40 5 and reaches 4629 8 m3 s table 4 presents the flood peaks for baseline and other scenarios hence it can be clearly seen that under the combined influence of urban sprawl and increased rainfall the flood damage will be more extensive in comparison to the worst case urban sprawl only scenario 3 4 flood inundation mapping flood inundation extent and depths corresponding to the baseline and the future flood scenarios are simulated using the widely used logah et al 2017 moya quiroga et al 2016 and freely available two dimensional 2d hydraulic model hec ras usace 2016 the hydraulic domain fig 1 is discretized into computational cells of size 30 m 30 m since the srtm data for the river mouth area is not available the freely available general bathymetric chart of the oceans gebco data is used to fill up the no data pixels the pixels that correspond to buildings osm data are raised to about 5 m from the existing terrain data in an effort to make the flood hazard zoning more realistic the srtm data can be used with confidence for modeling high magnitude infrequent floods if the purpose of the study is not aligned towards detailed analysis like the design of hydraulic structures yan et al 2014 the hec ras can solve either 2d diffusive wave equations or full 2d saint venant equations for the 2015 chennai flood event the computing time for full 2d solution is 4 5 cpu time greater than that of diffusive wave solution however the difference in inundation extents simulated by the two solution schemes is found to be only 4 therefore in order to reduce the computation cost the 2d diffusive wave equation option is resorted to the runoff hydrographs obtained from the hec hms are used as upstream boundary conditions for the hec ras model the locations and the data pertaining to the upstream boundary conditions for the baseline scenario are indicated in figs 1 and 7 respectively the tidal data narasimhan et al 2016 is given as the downstream boundary condition at the river mouth suriya and mudgal 2012 used manning s n values of 0 025 m 1 3 s for 1976 and 0 03 m 1 3 s for 1985 floods however the 2015 chennai flood was a result of both fluvial and pluvial flooding the urban areas were flooded not only due to overflowing rivers but also due to lack of efficient drainage of the stormwater it is thus difficult to separate fluvial and pluvial flooding extents and calibrate manning s n value hence in this study all the scenarios are run for the manning s n values of 0 025 0 03 0 035 and 0 04 m 1 3 s to take care of the uncertainty associated with the friction coefficient in the simulated results the simulations are run with a stable and convergent time step of 6 s in order to validate the baseline simulation the flood marks surveyed soon after the 2015 chennai flood are used fig 8 the computed water depths are used to prepare flood inundation maps and a threshold water depth of 0 1 m is used to differentiate between dry and wet areas from fig 9 it can be seen that the range of manning s n values chosen for the study provides almost similar accuracy with respect to the r2 values however the simulations show different inundation patterns for different values of n the possible reason for getting similar r2 values may be due to the fact that all the surveyed points are located close to the adyar river moreover in the absence of an observed inundation extent map a single n value can introduce more uncertainty in the results hence all the results are reported in the form of a range for different values of n and scenarios however in a few cases the results are reported only for n 0 035 m 1 3 s to reduce the length of the paper 4 results and discussion fig 10 shows the simulated inundation extents for various scenarios that are run with a manning s n value of 0 035 m 1 3 s since the scenarios are run for different manning s n values the ranges of inundation extents and the average percentage increase in inundation area for various scenarios with respect to the baseline scenario are provided in table 4 the total inundation area seems to increase from about 30 8 38 6 km2 for the baseline to about 37 4 47 1 km2 21 5 22 for the worst case urban sprawl only scenario 2 5 the combined worst case urban sprawl and increased rainfall scenario magnify the inundation extent further by about 41 3 51 7 km2 that is an increase of 33 8 34 3 with respect to the baseline scenario the results indicate that the combined effect of urban sprawl and increased rainfall scenarios produce more inundation in comparison to the urban sprawl only situation the inundation extents are analyzed further to derive flood hazard maps the hazard zones are classified into four categories such as low moderate high and very high depending on the critical depths of inundation 0 1 0 6 1 4 and 3 5 m as given in table 5 according to suriya et al 2012 an inundation depth of 0 6 m causes floodwaters to enter house premises after inflicting damage to their gardens and garages and an additional increase in inundation depth is likely to cause considerable loss to residents in its report on the 2015 chennai flood nrsc isro 2015 indicates that for an inundation depth of about 1 4 m all the furniture and appliances placed on the floor gets submerged at a depth of about 3 5 m the ground floor gets completely submerged and floodwaters start rising above the level of the ground floor based on the above classification the inundation extents under different zones are computed for all the scenarios a summary of which is presented in table 6 it can be seen that for the 2 5 cc20 scenario the inundation areas under all the hazard zones except for the low hazard category have increased significantly when compared to both the baseline and urban sprawl only 2 5 scenarios this can be attributed to the increase in both flood depth and inundation extent under the combined scenario as the cma constitutes the hydraulic domain the number of buildings within the various hazard zones for different scenarios are calculated and plotted in fig 11 a box plot is provided to get a clear picture of the range and the average number of buildings that may be affected under different combinations of hazard zones and scenarios for a manning s n value of 0 035 m 1 3 s the number of buildings affected under low moderate high and very high hazard categories for the combined worst case scenario 2 5 cc20 is seen to increase by 68 61 72 and 65 respectively in comparison to the baseline scenario fig 11 shows that there is a consistent increase in the number of buildings counted in different hazard zones on moving from baseline to the 2 5 cc20 scenario these estimates based on osm data give an idea on the extent of flood damage that is likely to occur in the what if scenarios additionally the maximum inundation depths at important locations in the cma for various scenarios are summarized in table 7 places like anna nagar kotturpuram and gandhi nagar are the worst affected in all the scenarios as they are closer to the river from table 7 it can be seen that an increasing trend is observed from baseline to the worst case scenario similar inferences are also reported for the 2005 and 2015 floods by narasimhan et al 2016 the above analysis reiterates the importance of considering both urban sprawl and increased rainfall while delineating flood hazard zones for the future it may be emphasized that the results from these what if scenarios may be considered as indicators and not taken directly as future projections for 2030 however when more confirmed information on climate change projection and urban sprawl is available the results could be used for strategy planning of flood management for the region 5 summary and conclusions in this study the catastrophic 2015 chennai flood event is simulated using hydrologic hec hms hydraulic hec ras 2d modeling system the simulated results are validated with reservoir inflow and surveyed flood mark data considering this flood event as a baseline analysis on flood inundation and hazard zones for the occurrence of a similar extreme event in the future is carried out for the possible urban sprawl by 2030 and likely change in rainfall scenario given the rapid urbanization of the city an ann model is designed for constructing the spatially varying future urban sprawl scenarios the observed 2015 extreme rainfall event is scaled up by 5 20 to account for climate change effect for the same region two distinct sets of scenarios are generated considering a urban sprawl only and b both urban sprawl and scaled up rainfall to represent the likely influence of climate change from the analysis of various scenarios it can be concluded that the percentage increase in inundation extent for the worst case scenarios of urban sprawl only 2 5 and its combination with increased rainfall 2 5 cc20 cases are 21 5 22 and 33 8 34 3 respectively such a significant change in inundation is alarming for a metropolitan city like chennai as the associated damages would also increase accordingly under the worst case combined scenario the areas under all the hazard zones are seen to have increased when compared to both the baseline and urban sprawl only scenarios it is also found that on an average around 1 7 times more buildings are exposed to the hazard of flooding under the combined scenario 2 5 cc20 in comparison to the baseline scenario it can therefore be concluded that for a rapidly expanding city like chennai the combined effect of urban sprawl and climate change poses a severe challenge in preparing flood maps and hazard zones the evident increase in inundation extent calls for careful planning of urban expansion litter management conservation of the existing water bodies and improvement in the existing drainage system the study is carried out using freely available models and openly accessible data therefore the proposed methodology can be easily adopted for sites having limited field data it gives an idea of the flood hazard associated with the 2015 chennai flood the most intense in the past hundred years like scenarios the results should be considered as what if scenarios without limiting them to a definite time span for instance the results from urban sprawl only scenarios 1 5 2 0 and 2 5 help in understanding the increase in flood inundation and hazard for 1 5 2 0 and 2 5 times increase in urban areas with respect to the existing conditions while the scenarios 1 5 cc10 2 0 cc10 2 5 cc5 2 5 cc10 2 5 cc15 and 2 5 cc20 point to the disastrous consequences of different combinations of increased rainfall and urban sprawl scenarios the development and spread of urban sprawl at the upper portion of the study area therefore need careful regulation moreover a diversion channel from the upper catchment bypassing the city to the ocean may help in reducing flood damages in the future however a complete flood risk assessment involves identifying the probability of occurrence and the damage associated with various magnitudes of floods incorporation of flood risk into urban development and preparedness planning will help increase the resilience of the city s flood protection system the influence of urbanization induced local microclimate and sea level rise on flooding is not investigated in this study and hence presents new avenues for future research furthermore damage assessment from both pluvial and fluvial floods implications of various flood protection measures and storm drainage network remain uninvestigated for the chennai city declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known competing
