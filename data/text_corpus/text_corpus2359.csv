mm year 1 whereas the western part is affected by an arid climate dry and hot in the summer and wet and cool in the winter with an annual precipitations do not exceed 150 mm year 1 ben alaya et al 2013 agoubi 2018 gabès region is characterized by no perennial rivers however heavy storms can create surface runoff which is discharged via wadis such as oued el akarit oued jir and oued el hamma ben alaya et al 2013 agoubi 2018 see fig 2 2 1 geological setting the studied region is located in the eastern boundary of the tunisian meridional atlas from a geological point of view the study area characterized by the exposure of cretaceous and quaternary layers in surface fig 1 tectonically the study area constitutes a transition zone between the dahar plateau from south western and the jeffara platform from the coastal zone furthermore it characterized by the presence of salt depressions fejij chotts zargouni 1985 bouaziz et al 2002 in addition the tectonic features present a multidirectional faults e w normal chotts fault nw se gafsa fault made a horsts and graben mamou 1990 zouaghi et al 2011 due to these tectonic deformations the permo trassic substratum is brought up to very near the soil surface the layers slant in the mediterranean s direction and get thicker elsewhere bouaziz 1995 in the study area cretaceous formations were composed by turonian and albian thereby the barremian is formed by gypsum clay and anhydrite ben hammouda et al 2013 whereas the albian is represented by dolomite limestone and marl the turonian crops out southeastern part is composed by dolomite the mio pliocene is represented by gypsum clays and sands finally the quaternary covers the region by clay with a crust of gypsum fig 1 2 2 hydrogeological setting in the mediterranean coastal area of study area the hydrogeological system is made of different aquifers systems according to the lateral variation and the tectonic accidents those aquifers are interconnected lateral and vertical in addition the deferent reservoirs which are exploited in gabes region are logged in the quaternary alluviums and in the cretaceous deposits the shallow aquifer is hosted in the sandy clay of mio pliocene deposits whereas the senonian composed by two stratigraphic units represented by limestone and marly limestone units sahli et al 2013 in the continental

thermal continental intercalary ci logged in continental sandstone clay formations ben alaya et al 2013 in other hand the jeffara aquifer was formed in the upper cretaceous formations makni et al 2012 agoubi 2018 those aquifers faced a dropdown in the piezometric level due to the low recharge process and the overexploitation of those resources in industry agriculture and human activities ben hammouda et al 2013 3 methodology 3 1 factors controlling groundwater recharge aquifer recharge is controlled by several factors the most important factors were topography lithology geological features groundwater depth widespread cracks primary porosity secondary porosity slope drainage land use and cover and climate these variables influence the presence and groundwater flow in a given region hydrogeology experiments and on site geophysical studies help explain the groundwater recharge process and assess spatial temporal differences in study regions abdollahi et al 2015 melki et al 2017 as shown in fig 1 the methodology used in this study focused on groundwater potential recharge areas delineation using k som method integrated remote sensing and gis techniques however in order to delineate groundwater potential recharge areas a database including geological hydrogeological and topographic data was implemented in this study eight parameters were considered to assess groundwater potential areas soil type land cover use slope runoff density of lineament drainage density lithology and geomorphology the lithological map was prepared by assembling geo referencing and digitizing local geological maps the land use and cover data were obtained through the landsat 8 satellite images processing and then converted into raster format 30 m resolution the spatial pattern of the different factors estimated by k som method will be presented with arcgis shown the lateral variations of the different parameters to identify regions in the study area where potential recharge zone may exist 3 2 parameters influencing groundwater recharge the main parameters influencing groundwater recharge were grouped into three groups the first group is the physiographic parameters slope lineament density geomorphology and lithology the second contained the climatic parameters runoff drainage density and the environmental parameters are presented as a third group involved soil type and land cover use all the parameters considered in this study as well as the role and influence of each parameter on recharging will be detailed in what follows soil type the soil type parameter has an important influence on water infiltration so the soil types will be grouped and classified into numerous classes on the basis of texture thickness drainage state and water transmission capacity viessman et al 1989 in recent literature soil are classified into three classes such as sandy and sandy silt sandy clay and silt and clay sandy clay for each soil class a weight will be assigned land cover use this parameter is one of the most important factor influencing the groundwater recharge land cover such as residential areas and vegetation cover control the groundwater recharge leduc et al 2001 indicated that groundwater recharge is affected by land utilization and vegetation cover thereby land use classes will be deciphered from landsat 8 oli tirs satellite images slope groundwater recharge is affected by slope al saud et al 2010 el baz 1995 machiwal et al 2011 choi et al 2012 due to the substantial high accumulation of rainwater low slopes promote groundwater recharge the slope variance is assessed by the slope analysis function of gis using data from the tunisian digital terrain runoff runoff is the unique source of water recharge in arid and semi arid aeras the runoff assessment depends on outcrop lithology in study area which provides an important index of percolation trabelssi et al 2009 the runoff is estimated as follow 1 1 r 0 0164 p i g where r is the runoff p is the mean of precipitation and ig is the slope lineament density lineament density parameter is a critical in groundwater recharge assessment and delineation lineament faults fractures and discontinuity surfaces provides the groundwater flow pathways abdalla 2012 the strm dataset and geological map were used to produce lineament in the study area using the geomatica 2015 platform the density of lineaments is calculated as follows 2 in which li is the length of each network portion and a is its surface 2 l d 1 n l i a drainage density drainage network factor is an important parameter for groundwater recharge assessment thus groundwater infiltration rate is more important in the highest runoff density region huang et al 2013 drainage network was generated from the topographic map using archydro 10 8 software this factor is computed as follows 3 where si is the length of ith drainage network and a is the surface of studied area 3 d d i 1 n s i a lithology the lithology affects significantly water infiltration el baz 1995 oikonomidis 2015 the geological map 1 100 000 of the study area will be used to assess the lithology variation geomorphology the geomorphology of the study area plays an important role in water distribution and availability and helps to identify potential groundwater recharge areas therefore alluvial plain and low slopes help a great deal in groundwater infiltration due to their high porosity and permeability 3 3 kohonen s self organizing map analysis kohonen s self organizing map k som is an artificial neural network cereghino and park 2009 designed by kohonen 1982 several authors such as cereghino and park 2009 clark 2018 describe k som as an excellent technique for high dimensional data visualization that decreases map dimensions 1 or 2 by grouping related data items together the self organizing map presents one of the most prominent neural network models fig 3 the k som is an unsupervised learning machine and required a limited amount of information as input data it has the property of preserving topology data as well as the distance between them vesanto and alhoneimi 2000 ousmana et al 2016 clark 2018 the kohonen self organizing map algorithm uses the distance between the best matching unit bmu and each data point to calculate error the proportion of data using two bmus that are not contiguous is calculated by k som as topographic error kohonen 1982 in kohonen maps the neighborhood function hj k t is a continuous gaussian function fig 4 the standard deviation is reduced resulting in a reduction in the size of the neighborhood t the learning speed is controlled by the learning step x whereas the convergence condition is based on standard deviation t ε x and σ x are calculated using the formulas 4 and 5 respectively 4 ε x ε i ε f ε i 1 t m a x 5 σ x σ i σ f σ i 1 t m a x the topological error te and quantization error qe criteria are used to validate the som classification te is a criterion for describing how the som maintains data topology the data percent of the first two non adjacent bmus is measured qe is the distance between data and bmu kohonen 2001 qe is computed as follow 6 6 qe 1 n i 1 n x i w x i 2 in which n is the number of dataset i is the ith individual and w xi is the best matching unit of the individual 3 4 factor s and rating system the infiltration rate is used to assess factors governing groundwater potential recharge the chosen parameters were rated and a score from 1 to 10 is assigned for each parameter table 1 according to previous studies such as yeh et al 2016 and dar et al 2020 factors namely slope lithology land use land cover drainage density lineaments density and runoff were rated from 1 to 8 in terms of their contribution to groundwater recharge the fusion of these parameters is represented by the final potential recharge map of the study area the integration of different factors and their causality links were taken into account while calculating the potential recharge used to estimate groundwater recharge as the factor weight is assessed using inter parameter relationship effects fig 5 the major effect is scored 1 and indicates a significant influence whereas the weight 0 5 is affected to the minor effect table 2 as follow 7 7 s c o r e major effect minor effect major effect minor effect 100 4 results and discussion 4 1 lithology groundwater recharge is affected by lateral and vertical changes of strata it has been pointed out by several researchers that the lithology of the near surface formations impact the potential recharge amount of groundwater resources the physic chemical proprieties of these deposits influence furthermore the recharge potential namely porosity and permeability oikonomidis et al 2015 welter 2018 this research includes rock variation that may alter lineages and morphology the gabes district is overlain by alluviums and quaternary sediments which account for nearly 70 of the absolute region according to the lithology map fig 6 h in the study area the lower pleistocene and pliocene are represented by sands and conglomerates which characterize by a moderate permeability and porosity important to the recharge phenomena the miocene is composed of coarse sand limestone marls and cretaceous dolomite were covered the reliefs that variability of lithology layers may can minimize the infiltration rate the lithology parameter represents 25 of the potential recharge of the study area 4 2 geomorphology it is seen from fig 6a that plains and low landforms dominate the gabes region s topography with a relief ranging from 165 to 605 m above sea level mountains and high landforms were characterized the southern portion of the research region as well from the north based on the geomorphology study gabes region show a plains in the mostly area in which the recharge phenomena can have a good rate furthermore in a wide part of study area these characteristics may favorite the composition of wind deposits floodplain deposits and salt evaporate deposits variations in the geomorphology character proved a lateral contrast in the potential recharge area 4 3 soil type s factor it is shown from fig 6g that the study area presents a different soil types the most of the area are covered by sandy clay sandy silty soils calcic soils and evaporitic thus that variation provides the physic characteristic of each type such as permeability and porosity based on those characteristic the recharge rate faces a very important contrast all over the study region giving a point of view about the potential zone that can be managed 4 4 land cover based on fig 6f the mostly of the study area is exposed land more than 70 of the study area where 10 of the region is covered by farming lands and sparse vegetation that poverty of greenland have a very important influence on the climate change in the region zheng et al 2019 the vegetation loss has many bad impact such as the raise of temperature degree this subsequently drives the rate of evaporation reducing the phenomenon of recharging as presenting in fig 6f the lateral variation of land cover can create a micro climate like the oasis those characteristic influence the classification of potential recharge area melki et al 2017 4 5 drainage density the drainage network in gabes region was determined using the srtm the most important flows are located in the south part of the stud region such as the jir wadis segui wadis and the zigzaw wadis in addition we found as well the akarit wadis and the elhamma wadis in the north part those wadis are decomposed in tow category endorhic elhamma wadis and exoreic zigzaw wadis the density of drainage is varied between 0 3 5 km km2 the density where they are larger than 1 5 km km2 presented as a region with excellent recharge zone those area present around 30 of the region the evaluation of drainage density map is shown in fig 6c 4 6 analysis of lineament density in order to study the evaluation of the lineaments in gabes region we are based on the srtm data and geological maps of the study region the result was verified onsite and by bibliography alaya et al 2014 zouaghi et al 2011 the density map was obtained by arcgis 10 8 the most important values is located in the north zone and in the mountainous area may related the higher elevation of those areas more than 50 from the cases study present a value more than 1 km km2 the lineament density shown in fig 6b for the gabes area indicates that the relief has a high lineament density with values varying from 1 to 1 8 km km2 the lineaments analyses presents clearly demonstrate the superiority of a major nnw sse lineament course this correlates to the general position of deformation stress associated with the miocene compressive tectonic process zargouni 1985 dlala 1995 4 7 slope the assessment of the slope evolution in the study area was done based on the dem treated by gis tools as shown the generated maps in fig 6e the gabes region was split into three topographic levels based on the slope diagram the first level 0 2 is assigned to very good class which my ameliorate the infiltration present the most of the study region the second level 2 4 are rated as moderate groundwater recharge while the third level is classified as having an intensity of 4 10 suggesting a poor groundwater potential recharge 4 8 runoff the study area is categorized into five classes on the basis of runoff map fig 6d very good groundwater potential recharge is assigned to the first class 4 this class is located in flat terrain the second category 4 20 considered as good for groundwater recharge and the third category 20 35 is a moderate recharge area however the rest of classes are exceeding 35 and considered as poor potential groundwater recharge area 4 9 potential groundwater recharge areas assessment k som has been performed using the various parameter that were indicated above from study area kohonen s self organizing map was realized using som matlab toolbox vesanto et al 1999 learning was realized until the quantization error after each time has been minimized the ksom quantification error fig 7 a shows that the error was stabilized in minimum values after 40 iterations the k som analysis results of clustered recharge data from the study area into five classes from very low to very good recharge potential zones the five classes were validated by the principal parameters analysis resulting of k som fig 7b c the five groundwater recharge classes were identified was presented as a map shown the lateral variation of those classes fig 7 d the first class is very low recharge and represents 27 of total surface of study area the second is a low recharge area and occupies a 23 of study area the third is about 40 of the surface and considered as moderate recharge however the 7 is a good potential recharge and the fifth class has a very high potential recharge and represent only 3 of the total surface of study area the hydro geomorphological settings of study area reveal that the alluvial plain in the central basin has great groundwater potential to promote water infiltration characterized by lower slope high permeability and high infiltration rate as for the mountainous and the hilly sites located to the southern and western part of the study area have limited potential recharge due to the low infiltration rate the most important feeding area in the gabes region is characterized by the interrelation of geological and geomorphological factors where the low slopes and the intrusion rate are very important as well as the presence of ground cover that can enhance recharge rates whereas the northern mountain chain is a faulted zone showing a very good potential recharge indicator the most part of study area is a platform and coastal areas have a moderate recharge index due to the low lineament density and drainage as well as the influence of the land cover use which has a bad impact on the groundwater recharge table 3 the rest of the region presents the association of the same factors inducing a low and a very low potential groundwater recharge quantifying groundwater recharge in southern tunisia using hydrological and hydrodynamic models is a difficult task baba sy 2005 has indicated that infiltration rate varies between 2 and 10 in southern tunisia consequently infiltration is of 7 12 mm year which is estimated to 5 8 of annual precipitation for potential groundwater recharge estimation in gabès region on the basis of fersi 1979 findings an infiltration rate of 8 from the annual precipitation of 200 mm y 1 potential groundwater recharge is estimated to 11 461 248 m3 y 1 for a given hydrogeological system the identification of the potential recharge zone using the rst can be used to translate several variables into one basic criterion to determine the proposal recharge zone the rst provided as flexible approach fir adding or changing parameters this method are using by several researches magsar et al 2021 yahiaoui et al 2021 in the desalination of the potential recharge area all over the world such as taiwan angola arab saoudi and tunisia suissi et al 2018 was applied that method in same study region integrating a various parameters while reducing possibility of errors varaious are the study that based on the remote sensing technique but use of rst copulate with k som method was so limited in according with earlier studies yahiaoui et al 2021 the rst copulated with the self organizing maps in this study used to evaluate the lateral variation of potential recharge zone in arid area especially in gabes region this method is robust and flexible with the criteria as well it can be applied in many regions and in another similar study area in other hand the results of remote sensing technique and self organizing maps are very sensitive depending on the data base used in the study of the recharge zone 5 conclusion and recommendation in this works the groundwater recharge areas were assessed and delineated in order to purpose a required strategy to improve and save groundwater resources based on parametric model gis rst and k som groundwater recharge depend in several parameters slope lithology geomorphology drainage lineaments land cover user that have been weighted and scored thus potential recharge zone is classified into five classes very good good moderate low and very low where the most part of the gabes region are classed as moderate 10 of the total area representing a high recharge while the rest of the region has a medium to very low potential recharge the estimated potential groundwater recharge in gabès region is of 11 46 mm3 year although the method adopted in this study allowed realistic and reliable results nevertheless this method needs to be supplemented by other methods such as the chloride mass balance and isotopic tracing this paper provides valuable information on groundwater recharge estimation which can be considered an effective management tool for sustainable development the results described in this study could be easily replicated with similar conditions it is recommended to use multiple methods for the same area to assess the accuracy of the methods used foundation

thereby the barremian is formed by gypsum clay and anhydrite ben hammouda et al 2013 whereas the albian is represented by dolomite limestone and marl the turonian crops out southeastern part is composed by dolomite the mio pliocene is represented by gypsum clays and sands finally the quaternary covers the region by clay with a crust of gypsum fig 1 2 2 hydrogeological setting in the mediterranean coastal area of study area the hydrogeological system is made of different aquifers systems according to the lateral variation and the tectonic accidents those aquifers are interconnected lateral and vertical in addition the deferent reservoirs which are exploited in gabes region are logged in the quaternary alluviums and in the cretaceous deposits the shallow aquifer is hosted in the sandy clay of mio pliocene deposits whereas the senonian composed by two stratigraphic units represented by limestone and marly limestone units sahli et al 2013 in the continental western part of study area the main aquifers were logged in the cretaceous deposits such as the thermal continental intercalary and the jeffara aquifer the senonian aquifer hosted limestone and thermal continental intercalary ci logged in continental sandstone clay formations ben alaya et al 2013 in other hand the jeffara aquifer was formed in the upper cretaceous formations makni et al 2012 agoubi 2018 those aquifers faced a dropdown in the piezometric level due to the low recharge process and the overexploitation of those resources in industry agriculture and human activities ben hammouda et al 2013 3 methodology 3 1 factors controlling groundwater recharge aquifer recharge is controlled by several factors the most important factors were topography lithology geological features groundwater depth widespread cracks primary porosity secondary porosity slope drainage land use and cover and climate these variables influence the presence and groundwater flow in a given region hydrogeology experiments and on site geophysical studies help explain the groundwater recharge process and assess spatial temporal differences in study regions abdollahi et al 2015 melki et al 2017 as shown in fig 1 the methodology used in this study focused on groundwater potential recharge areas delineation using k som method integrated remote sensing and gis techniques however in order to delineate groundwater potential recharge areas a database including geological hydrogeological and topographic data was implemented in this study eight parameters were considered to assess groundwater potential areas soil type land cover use slope runoff density of lineament drainage density lithology and geomorphology the lithological map was prepared by assembling geo referencing and digitizing local geological maps the land use and cover data were obtained through the landsat 8 satellite images processing and then converted into raster format 30 m resolution the spatial pattern of the different factors estimated by k som method will be presented with arcgis shown the lateral variations of the different parameters to identify regions in the study area where potential recharge zone may exist 3 2 parameters influencing groundwater recharge the main parameters influencing groundwater recharge were grouped into three groups the first group is the physiographic parameters slope lineament density geomorphology and lithology the second contained the climatic parameters runoff drainage density and the environmental parameters are presented as a third group involved soil type and land cover use all the parameters considered in this study as well as the role and influence of each parameter on recharging will be detailed in what follows soil type the soil type parameter has an important influence on water infiltration so the soil types will be grouped and classified into numerous classes on the basis of texture thickness drainage state and water transmission capacity viessman et al 1989 in recent literature soil are classified into three classes such as sandy and sandy silt sandy clay and silt and clay sandy clay for each soil class a weight will be assigned land cover use this parameter is one of the most important factor influencing the groundwater recharge land cover such as residential areas and vegetation cover control the groundwater recharge leduc et al 2001 indicated that groundwater recharge is affected by land utilization and vegetation cover thereby land use classes will be deciphered from landsat 8 oli tirs satellite images slope groundwater recharge is affected by slope al saud et al 2010 el baz 1995 machiwal et al 2011 choi et al 2012 due to the substantial high accumulation of rainwater low slopes promote groundwater recharge the slope variance is assessed by the slope analysis function of gis using data from the tunisian digital terrain runoff runoff is the unique source of water recharge in arid and semi arid aeras the runoff assessment depends on outcrop lithology in study area which provides an important index of percolation trabelssi et al 2009 the runoff is estimated as follow 1 1 r 0 0164 p i g where r is the runoff p is the mean of precipitation and ig is the slope lineament density lineament density parameter is a critical in groundwater recharge assessment and delineation lineament faults fractures and discontinuity surfaces provides the groundwater flow pathways abdalla 2012 the strm dataset and geological map were used to produce lineament in the study area using the geomatica 2015 platform the density of lineaments is calculated as follows 2 in which li is the length of each network portion and a is its surface 2 l d 1 n l i a drainage density drainage network factor is an important parameter for groundwater recharge assessment thus groundwater infiltration rate is more important in the highest runoff density region huang et al 2013 drainage network was generated from the topographic map using archydro 10 8 software this factor is computed as follows 3 where si is the length of ith drainage network and a is the surface of studied area 3 d d i 1 n s i a lithology the lithology affects significantly water infiltration el baz 1995 oikonomidis 2015 the geological map 1 100 000 of the study area will be used to assess the lithology variation geomorphology the geomorphology of the study area plays an important role in water distribution and availability and helps to identify potential groundwater recharge areas therefore alluvial plain and low slopes help a great deal in groundwater infiltration due to their high porosity and permeability 3 3 kohonen s self organizing map analysis kohonen s self organizing map k som is an artificial neural network cereghino and park 2009 designed by kohonen 1982 several authors such as cereghino and park 2009 clark 2018 describe k som as an excellent technique for high dimensional data visualization that decreases map dimensions 1 or 2 by grouping related data items together the self organizing map presents one of the most prominent neural network models fig 3 the k som is an unsupervised learning machine and required a limited amount of information as input data it has the property of preserving topology data as well as the distance between them vesanto and alhoneimi 2000 ousmana et al 2016 clark 2018 the kohonen self organizing map algorithm uses the distance between the best matching unit bmu and each data point to calculate error the proportion of data using two bmus that are not contiguous is calculated by k som as topographic error kohonen 1982 in kohonen maps the neighborhood function hj k t is a continuous gaussian function fig 4 the standard deviation is reduced resulting in a reduction in the size of the neighborhood t the learning speed is controlled by the learning step x whereas the convergence condition is based on standard deviation t ε x and σ x are calculated

rate is used to assess factors governing groundwater potential recharge the chosen parameters were rated and a score from 1 to 10 is assigned for each parameter table 1 according to previous studies such as yeh et al 2016 and dar et al 2020 factors namely slope lithology land use land cover drainage density lineaments density and runoff were rated from 1 to 8 in terms of their contribution to groundwater recharge the fusion of these parameters is represented by the final potential recharge map of the study area the integration of different factors and their causality links were taken into account while calculating the potential recharge used to estimate groundwater recharge as the factor weight is assessed using inter parameter relationship effects fig 5 the major effect is scored 1 and indicates a significant influence whereas the weight 0 5 is affected to the minor effect table 2 as follow 7 7 s c o r e major effect minor effect major effect minor effect 100 4 results and discussion 4 1 lithology groundwater recharge is affected by lateral and vertical changes of strata it has been pointed out by several researchers that the lithology of the near surface formations impact the potential recharge amount of groundwater resources the physic chemical proprieties of these deposits influence furthermore the recharge potential namely porosity and permeability oikonomidis et al 2015 welter 2018 this research includes rock variation that may alter lineages and morphology the gabes district is overlain by alluviums and quaternary sediments which account for nearly 70 of the absolute region according to the lithology map fig 6 h in the study area the lower pleistocene and pliocene are represented by sands and conglomerates which characterize by a moderate permeability and porosity important to the recharge phenomena the miocene is composed of coarse sand limestone marls and cretaceous dolomite were covered the reliefs that variability of lithology layers may can minimize the infiltration rate the lithology parameter represents 25 of the potential recharge of the study area 4 2 geomorphology it is seen from fig 6a that plains and low landforms dominate the gabes region s topography with a relief ranging from 165 to 605 m above sea level mountains and high landforms were characterized the southern portion of the research region as well from the north based on the geomorphology study gabes region show a plains in the mostly area in which the recharge phenomena can have a good rate furthermore in a wide part of study area these characteristics may favorite the composition of wind deposits floodplain deposits and salt evaporate deposits variations in the geomorphology character proved a lateral contrast in the potential recharge area 4 3 soil type s factor it is shown from fig 6g that the study area presents a different soil types the most of the area are covered by sandy clay sandy silty soils calcic soils and evaporitic thus that variation provides the physic characteristic of each type such as permeability and porosity based on those characteristic the recharge rate faces a very important contrast all over the study region giving a point of view about the potential zone that can be managed 4 4 land cover based on fig 6f the mostly of the study area is exposed land more than 70 of the study area where 10 of the region is covered by farming lands and sparse vegetation that poverty of greenland have a very important influence on the climate change in the region zheng et al 2019 the vegetation loss has many bad impact such as the raise of temperature degree this subsequently drives the rate of evaporation reducing the phenomenon of recharging as presenting in fig 6f the lateral variation of land cover can create a micro climate like the oasis those characteristic influence the classification of potential recharge area melki et al 2017 4 5 drainage density the drainage network in gabes region was determined using the srtm the most important flows are located in the south part of the stud region such as the jir wadis segui wadis and the zigzaw wadis in addition we found as well the akarit wadis and the elhamma wadis in the north part those wadis are decomposed in tow category endorhic elhamma wadis and exoreic zigzaw wadis the density of drainage is varied between 0 3 5 km km2 the density where they are larger than 1 5 km km2 presented as a region with excellent recharge zone those area present around 30 of the region the evaluation of drainage density map is shown in fig 6c 4 6 analysis of lineament density in order to study the evaluation of the lineaments in gabes region we are based on the srtm data and geological maps of the study region the result was verified onsite and by bibliography alaya et al 2014 zouaghi et al 2011 the density map was obtained by arcgis 10 8 the most important values is located in the north zone and in the mountainous area may related the higher elevation of those areas more than 50 from the cases study present a value more than 1 km km2 the lineament density shown in fig 6b for the gabes area indicates that the relief has a high lineament density with values varying from 1 to 1 8 km km2 the lineaments analyses presents clearly demonstrate the superiority of a major nnw sse lineament course this correlates to the general position of deformation stress associated with the miocene compressive tectonic process zargouni 1985 dlala 1995 4 7 slope the assessment of the slope evolution in the study area was done based on the dem treated by gis tools as shown the generated maps in fig 6e the gabes region was split into three topographic levels based on the slope diagram the first level 0 2 is assigned to very good class which my ameliorate the infiltration present the most of the study region the second level 2 4 are rated as moderate groundwater recharge while the third level is classified as having an intensity of 4 10 suggesting a poor groundwater potential recharge 4 8 runoff the study area is categorized into five classes on the basis of runoff map fig 6d very good groundwater potential recharge is assigned to the first class 4 this class is located in flat terrain the second category 4 20 considered as good for groundwater recharge and the third category 20 35 is a moderate recharge area however the rest of classes are exceeding 35 and considered as poor potential groundwater recharge area 4 9 potential groundwater recharge areas assessment k som has been performed using the various parameter that were indicated above from study area kohonen s self organizing map was realized using som matlab toolbox vesanto et al 1999 learning was realized until the quantization error after each time has been minimized the ksom quantification error fig 7 a shows that the error was stabilized in minimum values after 40 iterations the k som analysis results of clustered recharge data from the study area into five classes from very low to very good recharge potential zones the five classes were validated by the principal parameters analysis resulting of k som fig 7b c the five groundwater recharge classes were identified was presented as a map shown the lateral variation of those classes fig 7 d the first class is very low recharge and represents 27 of total surface of study area the second is a low recharge area and occupies a 23 of study area the third is about 40 of the surface and considered as moderate recharge however the 7 is a good potential recharge and the fifth class has a very high potential recharge and represent only 3 of the total surface of study area the hydro geomorphological settings of study area reveal that the alluvial plain in the central basin has great groundwater potential to promote water infiltration characterized by lower slope high permeability and high infiltration rate as for the mountainous and the hilly sites located to the southern and western part of the study area have limited potential recharge due to the low infiltration rate the most important feeding area in the gabes region is characterized by the interrelation of geological and geomorphological factors where the low slopes and the intrusion rate are very important as well as the presence of ground cover that can enhance recharge rates whereas the northern mountain chain is a faulted zone showing a very good potential recharge indicator the most part of study area is a platform and coastal areas have a moderate recharge index due to the low lineament density and drainage as well as the influence of the land cover use which has a bad impact on the groundwater recharge table 3 the rest of the region presents the association of the same factors inducing a low and a very low potential groundwater recharge quantifying groundwater recharge in southern tunisia using hydrological and hydrodynamic models is a difficult task baba sy 2005 has indicated that infiltration rate varies between 2 and 10 in southern tunisia consequently infiltration is of 7 12 mm year which is estimated to 5 8 of annual precipitation for potential groundwater recharge estimation in gabès region on the basis of fersi 1979 findings an infiltration rate of 8 from the annual precipitation of 200 mm y 1 potential groundwater recharge is estimated to 11 461 248 m3 y 1 for a given hydrogeological system the identification of the potential recharge zone using the rst can be used to translate several variables into one basic criterion to determine the proposal recharge zone the rst provided as flexible approach fir adding or changing parameters this method are using by several researches magsar et al 2021 yahiaoui et al 2021 in the desalination of the potential recharge area all over the world such as taiwan angola arab saoudi and tunisia suissi et al 2018 was applied that method in same study region integrating a various parameters while reducing possibility of errors varaious are the study that based on the remote sensing technique but use of rst copulate with k som method was so limited in according with earlier studies yahiaoui et al 2021 the rst copulated with the self organizing maps in this study used to evaluate the lateral variation of potential recharge zone in arid area especially in gabes region this method is robust and flexible with the criteria as well it can be applied in many regions and in another similar study area in other hand the results of remote sensing technique and self organizing maps are very sensitive depending on the data base used in the study of the recharge zone 5 conclusion and recommendation in this works the groundwater recharge areas were assessed and delineated in order to purpose a required strategy to improve and save groundwater resources based on parametric model gis rst and k som groundwater recharge depend in several parameters slope lithology geomorphology drainage lineaments land cover user that have been weighted and scored thus potential recharge zone is classified into five classes very good good moderate low and very low where the most part of the gabes region are classed as moderate 10 of the total area representing a high recharge while the rest of the region has a medium to very low potential recharge the estimated potential groundwater recharge in gabès region is of 11 46 mm3 year although the method adopted in this study allowed realistic and reliable results nevertheless this method needs to be supplemented by other methods such as the chloride mass balance and isotopic tracing this paper provides valuable information on groundwater recharge estimation which can be considered an effective management tool for sustainable development the results described in this study could be easily replicated with similar conditions it is recommended to use multiple methods for the same area to assess the accuracy of the methods used foundation

11796,identification of selection criteria is a crucial initial step in aquifer storage and recovery asr projects the lack of knowledge of suitable sites hydrological and geological characteristics could be limiting factors in the application of asr technology a total of 20 sites were evaluated in the eastern district of abu dhabi emirate using available data at each site based on 15 different criteria the study area is an agricultural intense region where groundwater is extensively used for irrigation the developed framework is proven to be useful in terms of asr planning the framework is based on weighting factors assigned to each hydrogeological and additional characteristic based on its relative importance in the asr site selection the developed scoring scheme is used with the 20 sites to assess the possibility of finding a suitable site for potential asr with promising aquifer performance the total score was used to develop final asr suitability maps the highest score of 142 out of 160 89 asr suitability was achieved in al khrair site followed by al dhahir with 138 out of 160 86 al shuwaib with 136 out of 160 85 and al bateen with 126 out of 160 79 the sites located at the eastern part of the study area had the highes scores the score is decreased at the sites located at the western and southern parts of the study area with the lowest score of 107 out of 160 at abu huraibah the characterization of sites should be mainly based on the availability of pumping stations in the vicinity of the study area that will be helpful in the future implementation of the asr project the detailed hydrogeological and operational data of the studied sites helped in the asr assessment graphical abstract best sites suitable for asr in the eastern district of abu dhabi emirate united arab emirates image 1 keywords managed aquifer recharge hydrogeological criteria groundwater management arid region site selection 1 introduction united arab emirates uae is located in the arid zone which is characterized by low amount of rainfall and high levels of evaporation elmahdy and mohamed 2013 mohamed et al 2021 sherif et al 2011 the groundwater is found in all regions of the uae and its potential quantity and quality in any area depends mainly on the geological formations prevailing in that region elmahdy and mohamed 2015a sherif et al 2022 the eastern district of abu dhabi emirate is characterized by the limited natural water resources which is represented by groundwater only mohamed et al 2021 as a result of excessive pumping operations over last decades with limited rates of natural recharge severe depletion of the groundwater has been developed in the eastern region of the uae khan et al 2019 the high rates of groundwater consumption for vegetation and farming purposes led to significant decline in the groundwater levels which is estimated to be more than 15 m below the ground surface at some areas in al ain region ead 2017 elmahdy and mohamed 2016 uae is in need of a large storage system that will overcome water demand during peak periods emergencies and periods when desalination plants are out of commission for reasons such as natural disasters industrial accidents war oil spill and other crises the need for an alternative approach to manage the water supply demand and provide uninterrupted freshwater supply is a major concern in the abu dhabi emirate the excess freshwater from desalination plants or any type of fresh water could be stored in aquifers using artificial recharge techniques which is one of the managed aquifer recharge mar techniques perdikaki et al 2022a b mar is gaining a lot of considerations for water managers all over the world due to it provides a cheap technique than the other storage techniques and economic solution of a safe water supply mar is considered as a potential supplier for water in arid countries where groundwater is over exploited or saline and will play an important role in solving water scarcity and restore the groundwater the successful implementation of mar will depend on understanding the capabilities and constraints of the mar techniques and the existing water infrastructure perdikaki et al 2022a b one of the improvements in implementing the mar systems are the advanced technologies applications to improve the aquifer characterization that will help in understanding of the local hydrogeological settings while the main challenge in studying the mar system performance is the groundwater modelling which require a comprehensive conceptual model and data on aquifer maliva et al 2015 significant efforts were started to the assessment and management of water resources such as implementation of sustainable water resources strategy in order to augment the groundwater storage and cope with increasing demand one of the important mar techniques to overcome the increasing water demands and is considered to be an alternative strategic solution for desalination plants is called aquifer storage and recovery asr which is referred to the injection of water into strategic underground aquifers witt et al 2021 with the increase of population the desalination capacity in uae has increased significantly to around 3636872 m3 day in 2010 compared to 909218 m3 day in 1998 which reflect the increase in water demand according to scad 2019 desalination plants are threatened by contamination from unpredicted environmental disasters of other crises the small capacity of desalinated water stored near the desalination plants ground storage tanks is used during the maintenance forced short shutdowns of the desalination plants it has been reported by some large scale desalination plants managers that the distribution system storage capacities range from only few hours to few days during some climatic conditions such as the cyclone that struck the sultanate of oman in 2006 or pollution events such as red tide or oil spill such as the oil spill occurred in sharjah some desalination plants were forced to shut down for few days these shutdowns caused the water service to be interrupted in several areas due to a deficiency in storage tank capacity missimer et al 2012 therefore there should be a management strategy to overcome demand during peak periods emergencies and periods when desalination plants are out of commission since majority of the desalination plants are located in dubai fujairah and abu dhabi emirates near the shoreline arabian gulf that desalinates the seawater and distribute it through pipelines to the remote water facilities al ain region depends on taweela and umm al nar desalination plants to fulfil its water needs therefore excess freshwater from desalination plants could be stored underground for future use using asr technique eggleston et al 2021 parimalarenganayaki 2021 soliman et al 2022 this approach would overcome any interruptions in the water supply caused by emergencies and the minimum 1 year time needed required to construct a new desalination plant al katheeri 2008 three asr pilot projects of artificial recharge have been planned in the uae the first operational asr in nizwa sharjah one in the western region liwa and the other one in eastern district of abu dhabi emirate al ain region hutchinson 1998 al katheeri 2008 klingbeil 2012 dawoud 2014 nizwa sharjah uae is considered as the first operational asr system established which is cost effective and has the potential to store freshwater produced from desalination plant during the low demand periods sharjah electricity water authority 2009 a feasibility study started on 2003 2005 followed by pilot testing of the asr project from 2006 to 2009 the aim of the asr is to replace the seasonal peak load capacity and utilize it during the high demand periods based on the results of the pilot testing and numerical models the recovery efficiency of the injected water is 95 with high potentiality to implement the asr system another large scale strategic water storage and recovery project in liwa abu dhabi uae aimed to store a surplus of 64000 m3 day desalinated seawater for an emergency water supply to the emirate of abu dhabi up to three months the surplus desalinated water was injected in a shallow to moderately deep aquifer north of liwa area in al ain region of uae the project was undertaken by national drilling company ndc in 1998 excess water from umm alnar and taweela desalination plants was stored in shallow aquifer the results of the study indicated that asr is important approach for restoring the depleted aquifer al katheeri 2008 many regions such as al ain that are located away from the coastline approximately greater than 150 km from the arabian gulf where the desalination plants are located rely mainly on the freshwater produced by these plants there are long distribution pipelines connecting the desalination plants with the water facilities located at different areas within al ain region in emergency situation maintenance or serious disruptions occurred the remote city region will be left without freshwater supply for an unspecified time period missimer et al 2012 therefore al ain region needs to have a long term storage capacity identifying the best locations for aquifer storage recovery asr prior the modelling stage using the computer software to simulate the capacity of the suitable asr sites to be recharged by the surplus water is the main aim of this study this study focused on the development of a framework that has the potential for evaluation of multiple sites for the suitability of asr the evaluation was developed to assess the suitable sites for asr based on site scoring system to provide the total score at each site which represent the asr suitability at that location each site was individually scored based on hydrogeological and additional criterions then multiplied by a weighting factor to calculate the total score for asr suitability sallwey et al 2018 imig et al 2020 eggleston et al 2021 soliman et al 2022 this framework is applied to a case study in al ain region for the selection of best site among 20 for a long term storage capacity detailed study and knowledge of the hydrogeological and additional components helped in defining the suitable sites for asr system 2 study area the study area is the eastern al ain region which is the fourth largest city in uae and the second largest city in abu dhabi emirate it covers a total area around 15100 km2 with population of 0 76 million scad 2017 and is characterized as dry arid region with high temperature throughout the year precipitation is scarce with annual rainfall up to 72 mm and average temperature is about 27 8 c elmahdy and mohamed 2015b c liaqat et al 2021 al ain region is near to the western border of sultanate oman and it is considered one of the largest oases of the arabian peninsula due to its distinctive location which allow the city to receive a plentiful of surface and subsurface drainage from the oman mountains al hajar mountains to the east of the city el ghawaby and el sayed 1997 mohamed et al 2007 therefore al ain region has better fresh groundwater underflow through the alluvial sediments in wadis drained from al hajar mountains and periodic storm runoff from water concentrated in wadis as compared to the rest of the country mohamed et al 2010a mohamed and elmahdy 2017 murad et al 2009 the study area boundary location map is shown in fig 1 hydrogeology of al ain region shows that it has two main aquifers namely gravel aquifer and the sand dune aquifer the gravel aquifer is considered to have the largest quantity of fresh groundwater in the uae alsharhan et al 2001 the gravel aquifer occurs in the alluvial deposits of the piedmont plains surrounding al hajar mountains from the west and east it is divided into the eastern gravel aquifer and western gravel aquifer the eastern gravel aquifer is composed of a series of alluvial flats in the study area the quaternary alluvium of the western gravel aquifer is composed of an approximately 60 m sequence of sand and gravel with thin layers of silt and clay alsharhan et al 2001 rizk and alsharhan 2003 sakizadeh et al 2019 brook and dawoud 2005 three main quaternary western gravel aquifers occur within the study area according to ead 2011 1 quaternary sand and gravel aquifer underlain by the upper fars formation sandstone siltstone mudstone and marl as basal unit khalifa 2004 mohamed et al 2010b located to the west of al ain region 2 quaternary sand and gravel aquifers east of jebel hafit al jaww plain which is underlined by the upper fars formation and lower fars formation evaporite beds of anhydrite gypsum halite and celestite with claystone mudstone and few limestone dolomite as a basal unit and 3 quaternary sand and gravel aquifer underlain by tectonically emplaced marlstones and shales as main basal unit with occasional limestone layers ead 2011 groundwater flow systems are classified according to the residence time into local intermediate and regional flow systems alsharhan et al 2001 the three types of groundwater flow systems exist in uae fig 2 the local groundwater flow system has short residence time and occurs only in the eastern mountains jabal hafit and al hajar mountains the quality of the water in this system is considered good and it belongs to hco3 water type and contains mg 2 ions alsharhan et al 2001 such as those exist in al jaww plain east of al ain region and khatt ras al khaimah springs al shahi 2002 the intermediate groundwater flow occurs in al ain al fayda area west of al ain region this system has a moderate residence time and the quality of this water is mainly brackish and it belongs to so4 2 water type and contains ca 2 ions the regional groundwater flow system discharge into the coastal areas towards the arabian gulf this system has a long residence time and the quality of this water is highly saline the water in this system belongs to cl 1 water type the salinity of the groundwater of the unconfined alluvial aquifer ranges from less than 1000 ppm fresh to more than 50000 ppm saline the salinity of the groundwater is increasing continuously in al ain region due to the over pumping practices which decline the groundwater level and quality dawoud and sallam 2012 3 methodology a scoring system was developed for this study based on site specific hydrogeological components which control the aquifer recharge process and additional components that can assess the suitability of asr sites in al ain region sallwey et al 2018 gibson et al 2018 imig et al 2020 the scoring system provide percentage of total suitability at each analyzed site for this purpose different hydrogeological and additional components fig 3 were assessed based on the suitability score and weighing factors of the site the total suitability score are used to create a final suitability maps and ranking the sites based on their potential suitability eggleston et al 2021 soliman et al 2022 3 1 site scoring procedure initially the required data of groundwater wells locations ground elevation in meters above sea level depth of aquifer water level and lithology for a specified period of time from 2013 to 2017 were collected in addition data regarding the specific yield permeability transmissivity and lithology were collected from al shahi 2002 for the potential asr suitability assessment twenty discrete sites at different locations within al ain region were identified as having the required information to be evaluated based on the sorted well data fig 1 a site scoring procedure was developed to assess the potential suitable site of asr system by providing a total score at each individual site within the study area each site was individually scored based on hydrological characteristics and additional components that has an assigned suitability hydrological characteristics and additional components were considered for the suitability assessment for asr site from previous information on asr criteria s published by several authors pyne 1995 hutchinson 1998 brown et al 2005 dillon et al 2006 vacher et al 2006 misut and voss 2007 ward et al 2007 woody 2008 minsley et al 2009 missimer and maliva 2010 zuurbier et al 2013 rambags et al 2013 stuyfzand et al 2017 each study has its own criteria ranges and a score were assigned based on its suitability that will help in the assessment of the suitable sites for asr system and disqualifying the sites that doesn t match the suitability assessment gibson et al 2018 imig et al 2020 fifteen criteria were selected and combined to develop criteria list the selected criteria focused on two criteria groups the first group is the aquifer characteristics which is the second mostly used criteria group in several studies sallwey et al 2018 aquifer characteristics have a significant influence on the asr system during injection and recovery of the water as well as the analysis of the model using the computer software the other group is related to additional components such as surface infrastructural and operational criterions that has impact of the cost and feasibility of the asr project at specific location within the study area a weighting factor was assigned to each hydrological characteristic and additional components based on its impact in the asr selection and its effect on the efficiency of the asr system based on previous investigations and cases of an implemented asr system sallwey et al 2018 soliman et al 2022 the weighting factor values range from 1 to 4 based on its significance where 1 has the lowest significance and 4 is the highest significance the site selection procedure was applied based on hydrological component having 7 characteristics and reevaluated based on both hydrological and additional components having 15 characteristics the weighting factor is then multiplied by the suitability score given in table 1 for 15 components assigned for each criterion at each site separately to get the score the score from the 15 criterions for each site is used to create a suitability maps the calculated score is summed up to obtain the total score at each discrete site and used to create the final suitability maps and ranking the sites suitable aquifer for asr system indicates a high storage capacity associated with high permeability components related to subsurface were ranked as the most significant criteria since they control the movement of the injected water within the aquifer storage zone brown et al 2005 however there is no specific understanding regarding the criteria and weighting factor to be applied for suitability mapping sallwey et al 2018 in this study it is required to store a large volume of surplus water in an aquifer maliva et al 2009 missimer et al 2012 without forming a bubble as a result of the different densities between the injected water and native saline groundwater lowry and anderson 2006 therefore the highest weighting factor 4 high significance was assigned to thickness of the aquifer m permeability m s and groundwater salinity two types of aquifers can be present in the proposed site depending on the bounding geological layers both confined and unconfined aquifers can be suitable for asr systems dillon et al 2006 but other hydrological criteria will help in the optimum asr site selection stuyfzand et al 2017 heterogeneity in aquifer s hydraulic properties and gradient would result in asr system failure if not studied carefully to ensure the movement of the injected water missimer and maliva 2010 the thickness of the unsaturated zone depth to water level should not be too high to minimize the energy costs during water recovery and not too low to ensure high recovery rates brown et al 2005 in addition as the distance to source water decrease the installation of asr system is considered least expensive and more feasible brown et al 2005 woody 2008 minsley et al 2009 therefore moderate weighting factor 3 medium significance was assigned to aquifer confinement uniformity of hydraulic properties hydraulic gradient depth to water level m predicted water supply exceeds demand and distance to source water recharge of high quality water into porous and unconsolidated aquifers are more favorable for asr systems compared to fractured and karstified aquifers the protected species and habitat as well as the nearby users wells might adversely influence the asr project woody 2008 low weighting factor 2 low significance was assigned to consolidation of the aquifer well density near the asr project recharge water quality and endangered species aerobic aquifer is more suitable for asr systems due to its less susceptibility to pathogens and bacteria of wastewater origin dillon and jiménez 2008 while aquifer mineralogy fluid rock interactions might result in unwanted results in the recovered water quality maliva et al 2007 woody 2008 therefore the very low weighting factor 1 very low significance was assigned to aquifer mineralogy and redox state of native groundwater 3 2 assigning weighting factors to each site the maximum score achieved using each criterion is the product of the weighting factor assigned for each hydrological and additional criterions by the suitability score for each discrete site the calculated score was imported to arcgis along with the study area boundary to create suitability mapping sallwey et al 2018 the score for each criterion at each site was presented using a color scale with dark green color showing the highest score and dark red color showing the lowest score thickness of the aquifer m permeability m s and groundwater salinity has the highest weighting factor which is equivalent to 4 thus the maximum score is 16 while the minimum score is 4 as shown in fig 3 for the thickness of aquifer criteria most of the sites has moderate score except three sites namely al hayer ajban and abu karrayah due to the low suitability score achieved the permeability criteria s score is high for the sites located at the east of the study area near the boundary of sultanate oman due to its unique location of the quaternary alluvium unconfined gravel aquifer while the groundwater salinity criteria score is also high at these sites due to natural recharge of the aquifer through surface and subsurface flow from al hajar mountains east of the study area and periodic storm runoff from water concentrated in wadis murad et al 2009 depth to water level uniformity of hydraulic properties and distance to source water has weighting factor equivalent to 3 thus the maximum score is 12 while the minimum score is 3 as shown in fig 4 at al khrair al dhahir remah and ajban sites the water level was encountered at depths greater than 30 m below ground level therefore these sites achieved a high score while al khrair al bateen and al quaa sites achieved a high score due to the homogeneity in the aquifer hydraulic properties in distance to source water criteria sweihan al khaznah and ayn al fayda sites achieved a high score due to their closeness to wastewater plants therefore high suitability score was assigned at these sites well density and consolidation porous non fractured has weighting factor equivalent to 2 thus the maximum score is 8 while the minimum score is 2 as shown in fig 5 all the sites are located near to water wells within 1 km radius owned by local houses and farmers near to the site thus the suitability score assigned to the sites are either 2 fair suitability or 3 good suitability the highest score was achieved at al khrair and ayn al fayda sites as they have the lowest well density for this study the highest score was achieved at al shuwaib ajban sweihan al saad al shuaibah abu karrayah and al araad sites because they are characterized by consolidated aquifer due to existence of hard materials and rocks according to well data while other sites are characterized by pervious and unconsolidated materials however both consolidated and unconsolidated aquifers have a high suitability score as both of them considered suitable for an asr system pyne 1995 woody 2008 dillon and jiménez 2008 redox state of native groundwater and aquifer mineralogy has weighting factor equivalent to 1 thus the maximum score is 4 while the minimum score is 1 as shown in fig 6 for the redox state of native groundwater criteria the suitability score assigned to the sites are either 1 poor suitability for anaerobic aquifer or 4 excellent suitability for aerobic aquifer most of the sites scored 4 except al quaa sayh al hamah and al shuwaib sites which scored 1 due to the existence of wastewater treatment plants in the vicinity which might cause contamination of the groundwater in that site if mixed with the wastewater for aquifer mineralogy criteria most of the sites scored 1 due to the quality of the groundwater which is saline and might cause unwanted deterioration of the recovered water as a result of chemical disequilibrium with the injected freshwater and might interact with the host materials while the sites that has fresh groundwater quality scored 4 due to natural purification of fine materials which characterize the aquifer at that specific location all the sites scored the same in hydraulic gradient aquifer confinement recharge water quality endangered species and predicted water supply exceeds the demand criterions the hydraulic gradient criteria are 2 fair suitability score for all sites due to moderate gradient in the study area the average westward hydraulic gradient is 0 004 based on 100 m of head change over a distance of 25 km hutchinson 1998 however according to brown et al 2005 hydraulic gradient of less than 0 001 is considered ideal for an asr system for the aquifer confinement criteria three geological layers were reported previously by usgs hutchinson 1998 and brook 2005 namely surficial aquifer sand and gravel aquifer upper fars formation and lower fars formation as evidenced by hundreds of the wells that were drilled by ndc national drilling company and usgs united states geological survey during the 1990s there is a hydrogeological connection between the bottom of the surficial aquifer and the underlain upper fars formation at the eastern part towards oman mountains sadhasivam et al 2018 therefore it was modeled that the surficial aquifer layer unconfined and highly productive quaternary alluvium and the upper fars formation is conceptualized as a one layer overlying the lower fars formation which is considered as the bottom of the aquifer or the top of the confining layer impermeable layer it was considered that groundwater recharges in an unconfined aquifer therefore all sites scored 3 good suitability which is equivalent to unconfined aquifer the recharge water quality criteria score for all sites was considered 4 excellent suitability as the aim of this study is to inject excess freshwater from desalination plants or water that meets all standards to avoid extra costs of treatment and avoid contamination of the aquifer for the endangered species criteria all sites scored 4 excellent suitability because all the sites have no adverse impact on any nearby protected species or habitat the predicted water supply exceeds the demand criteria water supply from the asr system should exceeds the water demand for successful investment therefore all sites scored 4 excellent suitability as the aim of this study is to provide the best suitable site for a long term strategic water supply 4 results and discussion the results obtained from each of the hydrological and additional components criteria are added to calculate the total score the total score is used to create final asr suitability maps of the study area two final asr suitability maps were developed based on two criteria groups the first map includes the sites ranked based on site specific hydrological criteria group that are directly related to the local aquifer characteristics and necessary for accurately selecting the potential site in terms of asr system performance the second map includes the same sites but ranked based on two criteria groups hydrological and additional components for selecting the potential site in terms of asr system performance as well as the operational and infrastructural feasibilities 4 1 results based on hydrological components the site selection procedure was applied for the 20 sites based on the most important 7 hydrological criterions to evaluate the possibility of finding potential location for an asr system the hydrological criterions is directly related to the efficiency of the asr system and will control the movement of the injected water within the aquifer storage zone brown et al 2005 maliva et al 2009 therefore site specific hydrological conditions are required for the successful implementation of the asr system the score suitability score multiplied by weighting factor at each criterion is summed up to calculate the total score out of 80 maximum possible score which will indicate the best location for a potential asr system according to the hydrological criterions the total score for the evaluated sites and its location within the study area are presented in final asr suitability map as shown in fig 7 the total score for each criterion at each site was presented using a spectral color scale with blue color showing the highest score and red color showing the lowest score the high asr suitability percentage indicates the promising site specific aquifer characteristics and the high potentiality of the site to be recharge with the sufficient water for long term storage that will fulfill the needs of water demands within the study area which is expected to increase in the future the results showed highest score in al khrair site followed by al dhahir and al shuwaib all the evaluated sites have an asr suitability greater than 61 the highest total score is al khrair and al dhahir sites which scored 91 asr suitability followed by al shuwaib site with 90 asr suitability and al bateen site with 78 asr suitability in terms of the highest significant criteria which is mostly related to aquifer such as the aquifer saturated zone permeability and groundwater salinity the sites have the following characteristics aquifer thickness is around 10 50 m which indicates good suitability score permeability ranges from 10 3 10 5 m s which indicates good to excellent suitability and fresh groundwater quality except al bateen site which fair suitability score due to its brackish saline groundwater quality 4 2 results based on hydrological and additional components another site scoring procedure based on two criteria groups divided into hydrological and additional criterions was applied on the same 20 discrete sites selected for the asr suitability assessment maximum possible total score is 160 which indicates the best location for a potential asr system considering the asr performance due to the favorable hydrological conditions brown et al 2005 woody 2008 and the operational and economic feasibility related to the additional components minsley et al 2009 the total score for the evaluated sites within the study area is shown in fig 8 fig 9 shows the total score for each criterion at each site using a spectral color scale with blue color showing the highest score and red color showing the lowest score all the evaluated sites have an asr suitability greater than 67 the highest total score is al khrair site which scored 142 out of 160 89 asr suitability followed by al dhahir site which scored 138 86 asr suitability and al shuwaib site which scored 136 85 asr suitability the highest scored three sites al khrair al dhahir and al shuwaib are located near the eastern boundary of the study area al khrair and al dhahir sites are located in al jaww plain area which is characterized by good quality water alsharhan et al 2001 due to its distinctive location which allow the area to receive a plentiful of surface and subsurface drainage from the oman mountains al hajar mountains to the east of the area while al shuwaib site is also near to al hajar mountains north of al jaww plain and have good freshwater quality the three sites achieved a high suitability score in the most significant hydrological criterions thickness of the aquifer permeability and groundwater salinity which have the highest weighting factor and directly related to the aquifer in terms of the additional components such as surface operational and infrastructural criterions most of the sites achieved good suitability score in the distance to source water criterion which have medium weighting factor while only three sites achieved better score the three sites are sweihan al khaznah and sayh al hamah which are located near to water treatment plants however the highest ranked sites are also located near to existing pumping stations in addition al khrair site achieved excellent suitability score in well density criterion which have a low significance while al shuwaib and al bateen achieved good suitability score 5 discussion in both site selection evaluations which were based on two different criteria groups the highest score in the 20 sites is achieved by al khrair site followed by al dhahir al shuwaib and al bateen sites respectively in general the total score is gradually decreasing towards the west of the study area as presented in the final suitability maps as most of the sites achieved low suitability score in groundwater salinity uniformity of hydraulic properties of the aquifer and aquifer mineralogy criterions while these sites have an intermediate suitability scores in permeability well density and depth to water level criterions in addition to the three sites with high percentage of asr suitability it was noticed that almost all sites has achieved at least 73 79 asr suitability at the north of the study area al hayer site achieved 73 asr suitability al hayer site is near to al shuwaib site and eastern boundary of the study area at the center of the study area al bateen site achieved 79 asr suitability and it is ranked fourth among the 20 evaluated sites at the west of the study area al khaznah site achieved 74 asr suitability due to its moderate to high suitability score in thickness of the aquifer and permeability criterions which have the highest weighting factor and distance to source water and depth to water level criterions which have medium weighting factor at the south of the study area al quaa site achieved 76 asr suitability due to its moderate to high suitability score in thickness of the aquifer and permeability criterions which have the highest weighting factor as well as depth to water level and uniformity of hydraulic properties of the aquifer criterions which have moderate weighting factor fig 10 compares results obtained here with other studies for the suitability of managed aquifer recharge in al ain region hutchinson 1998 dawoud 2013 sadhasivam and mohamed 2018 each study adopts different criteria for the evaluation of the best asr sites for instance environment agency abu dhabi dawoud 2013 used some hydrogeological criteria such as thickness of the aquifer thickness of the unsaturated zone aquifer confinement quality of native groundwater aquifer transmissivity and storativity hydraulic gradient and presence of third party using the aquifer in addition few other criteria such as distance to closest border or coastline infrastructure environmental aspects and land development another study of assessment of asr project in abu dhabi emirate was carried out by sadhasivam and mohamed 2018 in this investigation hydrological criteria as well as performance of each site in terms of rate of injection total volume of injection recovery efficiency radius of influence and type of cone were examined in order to find the most suitable location in abu dhabi emirates including the study area the result of the study was a general asr suitability map indicating the potential sites of asr project in abu dhabi emirates however the highest scored sites in dawoud 2013 and sadhasivam and mohamed 2018 including this study are marked in fig 9 mainly three suitable sites for an asr project in the study area were proposed previously in asr assessment studies the suitable sites in this study mainly located east of the study area al shuwaib site is located approximately near to two of the proposed sites by sadhasivam and mohamed 2018 and dawoud 2013 two of the proposed asr sites by sadhasivam and mohamed 2018 are located near al hayer site which achieved 73 asr suitability while one site by dawoud 2013 is located in al saad site which is near to the al bateen site which achieved 79 asr suitability in this study in the last decade the groundwater level in al khrair al shuwaib and al bateen sites are located within the stable groundwater zone according to the groundwater level changes map developed by ead 2018 two of the proposed asr sites by sadhasivam and mohamed 2018 are located within stable groundwater zone except site 3 which is located in an area with decline in groundwater level while sites 2 and 3 by dawoud 2013 are located close to al hayer area east of the study area and site 1 is located in the middle of the study area at al saad area were the groundwater level change is showing continuous decline an advantage of al khrair site compared to other sites is the existence of multiple pumping stations in the vicinity of the site as well as its unique site specific characteristics of the aquifer therefore al khrair site is the most favorable location for a potential asr system due to the high suitability score achieved in both criteria groups which consists of hydrological and additional components related to the local aquifer performance and other operational feasibility al shuwaib site followed by al bateen sites are considered also promising locations of a successful asr system 6 conclusion the need for an alternative approach to manage the water supply demand and provide uninterrupted freshwater supply is a major concern in the abu dhabi emirate mar is considered to have the potential to be a major contributor for water supply in semi arid and arid countries where groundwater is over exploited or saline asr site selection should be studied and planned carefully in order to minimize the potential problems and maximize the asr system performance this study analyzed 20 sites in eastern region of uae for asr suitability based on two criteria groups the first group focused on hydrological criteria which are directly related to the asr system performance the other group focused on the same hydrological criteria with additional components that will help in identifying the most feasible asr system based on the existing operational infrastructural criterions within the study area results of the final asr suitability maps showed that in both analyzed hydrological and additional components among 20 sites al khrair and al shuwaib achieved highest score the changes in groundwater level at these two sites are not significant and therefore they are located in stable groundwater zone the depth to water level for al khrair and al dhahir sites are greater than 30 m while al shuwaib and al bateen sites it ranges from 10 to 30 m therefore al khrair has promising water storage capacity followed by al shuwaib and al dhahir sites the advantage of al khrair site over other site is the existing of multiple pumping stations near the site and its location in the middle of fresh groundwater zone the asr suitability in general decreases while moving away from east of al ain to west however the highest achieved sites will be analyzed using computer software to understand the local aquifer performance and verify the capacity to store large volume of water under different scenarios that will help the water managers to take decision regarding the number of asr wells and amount of water to be stored funding this research was

relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
11796,identification of selection criteria is a crucial initial step in aquifer storage and recovery asr projects the lack of knowledge of suitable sites hydrological and geological characteristics could be limiting factors in the application of asr technology a total of 20 sites were evaluated in the eastern district of abu dhabi emirate using available data at each site based on 15 different criteria the study area is an agricultural intense region where groundwater is extensively used for irrigation the developed framework is proven to be useful in terms of asr planning the framework is based on weighting factors assigned to each hydrogeological and additional characteristic based on its relative importance in the asr site selection the developed scoring scheme is used with the 20 sites to assess the possibility of finding a suitable site for potential asr with promising aquifer performance the total score was used to develop final asr suitability maps the highest score of 142 out of 160 89 asr suitability was achieved in al khrair site followed by al dhahir with 138 out of 160 86 al shuwaib with 136 out of 160 85 and al bateen with 126 out of 160 79 the sites located at the eastern part of the study area had the highes scores the score is decreased at the sites located at the western and southern parts of the study area with the lowest score of 107 out of 160 at abu huraibah the characterization of sites should be mainly based on the availability of pumping stations in the vicinity of the study area that will be helpful in the future implementation of the asr project the detailed hydrogeological and operational data of the studied sites helped in the asr assessment graphical abstract best sites suitable for asr in the eastern district of abu dhabi emirate united arab emirates image 1 keywords managed aquifer recharge hydrogeological criteria groundwater management arid region site selection 1 introduction united arab emirates uae is located in the arid zone which is characterized by low amount of rainfall and high levels of evaporation elmahdy and mohamed 2013 mohamed et al 2021 sherif et al 2011 the groundwater is found in all regions of the uae and its potential quantity and quality in any area depends mainly on the geological formations prevailing in that region elmahdy and mohamed 2015a sherif et al 2022 the eastern district of abu dhabi emirate is characterized by the limited natural water resources which is represented by groundwater only mohamed et al 2021 as a result of excessive pumping operations over last decades with limited rates of natural recharge severe depletion of the groundwater has been developed in the eastern region of the uae khan et al 2019 the high rates of groundwater consumption for vegetation and farming purposes led to significant decline in the groundwater levels which is estimated to be more than 15 m below the ground surface at some areas in al ain region ead 2017 elmahdy and mohamed 2016 uae is in need of a large storage system that will overcome water demand during peak periods emergencies and periods when desalination plants are out of commission for reasons such as natural disasters industrial accidents war oil spill and other crises the need for an alternative approach to manage the water supply demand and provide uninterrupted freshwater supply is a major concern in the abu dhabi emirate the excess freshwater from desalination plants or any type of fresh water could be stored in aquifers using artificial recharge techniques which is one of the managed aquifer recharge mar techniques perdikaki et al 2022a b mar is gaining a lot of considerations for water managers all over the world due to it provides a cheap technique than the other storage techniques and economic solution of a safe water supply mar is considered as a potential supplier for water in arid countries where groundwater is over exploited or saline and will play an important role in solving water scarcity and restore the groundwater the successful implementation of mar will depend on understanding the capabilities and constraints of the mar techniques and the existing water infrastructure perdikaki et al 2022a b one of the improvements in implementing the mar systems are the advanced technologies applications to improve the aquifer characterization that will help in understanding of the local hydrogeological settings while the main challenge in studying the mar system performance is the groundwater modelling which require a comprehensive conceptual model and data on aquifer maliva et al 2015 significant efforts were started to the assessment and management of water resources such as implementation of sustainable water resources strategy in order to augment the groundwater storage and cope with increasing demand one of the important mar techniques to overcome the increasing water demands and is considered to be an alternative strategic solution for desalination plants is called aquifer storage and recovery asr which is referred to the injection of water into strategic underground aquifers witt et al 2021 with the increase of population the desalination capacity in uae has increased significantly to around 3636872 m3 day in 2010 compared to 909218 m3 day in 1998 which reflect the increase in water demand according to scad 2019 desalination plants are threatened by contamination from unpredicted environmental disasters of other crises the small capacity of desalinated water stored near the desalination plants ground storage tanks is used during the maintenance forced short shutdowns of the desalination plants it has been reported by some large scale desalination plants managers that the distribution system storage capacities range from only few hours to few days during some climatic conditions such as the cyclone that struck the sultanate of oman in 2006 or pollution events such as red tide or oil spill such as the oil spill occurred in sharjah some desalination plants were forced to shut down for few days these shutdowns caused the water service to be interrupted in several areas due to a deficiency in storage tank capacity missimer et al 2012 therefore there should be a management strategy to overcome demand during peak periods emergencies and periods when desalination plants are out of commission since majority of the desalination plants are located in dubai fujairah and abu dhabi emirates near the shoreline arabian gulf that desalinates the seawater and distribute it through pipelines to the remote water facilities al ain region depends on taweela and umm al nar desalination plants to fulfil its water needs therefore excess freshwater from desalination plants could be stored underground for future use using asr technique eggleston et al 2021 parimalarenganayaki 2021 soliman et al 2022 this approach would overcome any interruptions in the water supply caused by emergencies and the minimum 1 year time needed required to construct a new desalination plant al katheeri 2008 three asr pilot projects of artificial recharge have been planned in the uae the first operational asr in nizwa sharjah one in the western region liwa and the other one in eastern district of abu dhabi emirate al ain region hutchinson 1998 al katheeri 2008 klingbeil 2012 dawoud 2014 nizwa sharjah uae is considered as the first operational asr system established which is cost effective and has the potential to store freshwater produced from desalination plant during the low demand periods sharjah electricity water authority 2009 a feasibility study started on 2003 2005 followed by pilot testing of the asr project from 2006 to 2009 the aim of the asr is to replace the seasonal peak load capacity and utilize it during the high demand periods based on the results of the pilot testing and numerical models the recovery efficiency of the injected water is 95 with high potentiality to implement the asr system another large scale strategic water storage and recovery project in liwa abu dhabi uae aimed to store a surplus of 64000 m3 day desalinated seawater for an emergency water supply to the emirate of abu dhabi up to three months the surplus desalinated water was injected in a shallow to moderately deep aquifer north of liwa area in al ain region of uae the project was undertaken by national drilling company ndc in 1998 excess water from umm alnar and taweela desalination plants was stored in shallow aquifer the results of the study indicated that asr is important approach for restoring the depleted aquifer al katheeri 2008 many regions such as al ain that are located away from the coastline approximately greater than 150 km from the arabian gulf where the desalination plants are located rely mainly on the freshwater produced by these plants there are long distribution pipelines connecting the desalination plants with the water facilities located at different areas within al ain region in emergency situation maintenance or serious disruptions occurred the remote city region will be left without freshwater supply for an unspecified time period missimer et al 2012 therefore al ain region needs to have a long term storage capacity identifying the best locations for aquifer storage recovery asr prior the modelling stage using the computer software to simulate the capacity of the suitable asr sites to be recharged by the surplus water is the main aim of this study this study focused on the development of a framework that has the potential for evaluation of multiple sites for the suitability of asr the evaluation was developed to assess the suitable sites for asr based on site scoring system to provide the total score at each site which represent the asr suitability at that location each site was individually scored based on hydrogeological and additional criterions then multiplied by a weighting factor to calculate the total score for asr suitability sallwey et al 2018 imig et al 2020 eggleston et al 2021 soliman et al 2022 this framework is applied to a case study in al ain region for the selection of best site among 20 for a long term storage capacity detailed study and knowledge of the hydrogeological and additional components helped in defining the suitable sites for asr system 2 study area the study area is the eastern al ain region which is the fourth largest city in uae and the second largest city in abu dhabi emirate it covers a total area around 15100 km2 with population of 0 76 million scad 2017 and is characterized as dry arid region with high temperature throughout the year precipitation is scarce with annual rainfall up to 72 mm and average temperature is about 27 8 c elmahdy and mohamed 2015b c liaqat et al 2021 al ain region is near to the western border of sultanate oman and it is considered one of the largest oases of the arabian peninsula due to its distinctive location which allow the city to receive a plentiful of surface and subsurface drainage from the oman mountains al hajar mountains to the east of the city el ghawaby and el sayed 1997 mohamed et al 2007 therefore al ain region has better fresh groundwater underflow through the alluvial sediments in wadis drained from al hajar mountains and periodic storm runoff from water concentrated in wadis as compared to the rest of the country mohamed et al 2010a mohamed and elmahdy 2017 murad et al 2009 the study area boundary location map is shown in fig 1 hydrogeology of al ain region shows that it has two main aquifers namely gravel aquifer and the sand dune aquifer the gravel aquifer is considered to have the largest quantity of fresh groundwater in the uae alsharhan et al 2001 the gravel aquifer occurs in the alluvial deposits of the piedmont plains surrounding al hajar mountains from the west and east it is divided into the eastern gravel aquifer and western gravel aquifer the eastern gravel aquifer is composed of a series of alluvial flats in the study area the quaternary alluvium of the western gravel aquifer is composed of an approximately 60 m sequence of sand and gravel with thin layers of silt and clay alsharhan et al 2001 rizk and alsharhan 2003 sakizadeh et al 2019 brook and dawoud 2005 three main quaternary western gravel aquifers occur within the study area according to ead 2011 1 quaternary sand and gravel aquifer underlain by the upper fars formation sandstone siltstone mudstone and marl as basal unit khalifa 2004 mohamed et al 2010b located to the west of al ain region 2 quaternary sand and gravel aquifers east of jebel hafit al jaww plain which is underlined by the upper fars formation and lower fars formation evaporite beds of anhydrite gypsum halite and celestite with claystone mudstone and few limestone dolomite as a basal unit and 3 quaternary sand and gravel aquifer underlain by tectonically emplaced marlstones and shales as main basal unit with occasional limestone layers ead 2011 groundwater flow systems are classified according to the residence time into local intermediate and regional flow systems alsharhan et al 2001 the three types of groundwater flow systems exist in uae fig 2 the local groundwater flow system has short residence time and occurs only in the eastern mountains jabal hafit and al hajar mountains the quality of the water in this system is considered good and it belongs to hco3 water type and contains mg 2 ions alsharhan et al 2001 such as those exist in al jaww plain east of al ain region and khatt ras al khaimah springs al shahi 2002 the intermediate groundwater flow occurs in al ain al fayda area west of al ain region this system has a moderate residence time and the quality of this water is mainly brackish and it belongs to so4 2 water type and contains ca 2 ions the regional groundwater flow system discharge into the coastal areas towards the arabian gulf this system has a long residence time and the quality of this water is highly saline the water in this system belongs to cl 1 water type the salinity of the groundwater of the unconfined alluvial aquifer ranges from less than 1000 ppm fresh to more than 50000 ppm saline the salinity of the groundwater is increasing continuously in al ain region due to the over pumping practices which decline the groundwater level and quality dawoud and sallam 2012 3 methodology a scoring system was developed for this study based on site specific hydrogeological components which control the aquifer recharge process and additional components that can assess the suitability of asr sites in al ain region sallwey et al 2018 gibson et al 2018 imig et al 2020 the scoring system provide percentage of total suitability at each analyzed site for this purpose different hydrogeological and additional components fig 3 were assessed based on the suitability score and weighing factors of the site the total suitability score are used to create a final suitability maps and ranking the sites based on their potential suitability eggleston et al 2021 soliman et al 2022 3 1 site scoring procedure initially the required data of groundwater wells locations ground elevation in meters above sea level depth of aquifer water level and lithology for a specified period of time from 2013 to 2017 were collected in addition data regarding the specific yield permeability transmissivity and lithology were collected from al shahi 2002 for the potential asr suitability assessment twenty discrete sites at different locations within al ain region were identified as having the required information to be evaluated based on the sorted well data fig 1 a site scoring procedure was developed to assess the potential suitable site of asr system by providing a total score at each individual site within the study area each site was individually scored based on hydrological characteristics and additional components that has an assigned suitability hydrological characteristics and additional components were considered for the suitability assessment for asr site from previous information on asr criteria s published by several authors pyne 1995 hutchinson 1998 brown et al 2005 dillon et al 2006 vacher et al 2006 misut and voss 2007 ward et al 2007 woody 2008 minsley et al 2009 missimer and maliva 2010 zuurbier et al 2013 rambags et al 2013 stuyfzand et al 2017 each study has its own criteria ranges and a score were assigned based on its suitability that will help in the assessment of the suitable sites for asr system and disqualifying the sites that doesn t match the suitability assessment gibson et al 2018 imig et al 2020 fifteen criteria were selected and combined to develop criteria list the selected criteria focused on two criteria groups the first group is the aquifer characteristics which is the second mostly used criteria group in several studies sallwey et al 2018 aquifer characteristics have a significant influence on the asr system during injection and recovery of the water as well as the analysis of the model using the computer software the other group is related to additional components such as surface infrastructural and operational criterions that has impact of the cost and feasibility of the asr project at specific location within the study area a weighting factor was assigned to each hydrological characteristic and additional components based on its impact in the asr selection and its effect on the efficiency of the asr system based on previous investigations and cases of an implemented asr system sallwey et al 2018 soliman et al 2022 the weighting factor values range from 1 to 4 based on its significance where 1 has the lowest significance and 4 is the highest significance the site selection procedure was applied based on hydrological component having 7 characteristics and reevaluated based on both hydrological and additional components having 15 characteristics the weighting factor is then multiplied by the suitability score given in table 1 for 15 components assigned for each criterion at each site separately to get the score the score from the 15 criterions for each site is used to create a suitability maps the calculated score is summed up to obtain the total score at each discrete site and used to create the final suitability maps and ranking the sites suitable aquifer for asr system indicates a high storage capacity associated with high permeability components related to subsurface were ranked as the most significant criteria since they control the movement of the injected water within the aquifer storage zone brown et al 2005 however there is no specific understanding regarding the criteria and weighting factor to be applied for suitability mapping sallwey et al 2018 in this study it is required to store a large volume of surplus water in an aquifer maliva et al 2009 missimer et al 2012 without forming a bubble as a result of the different densities between the injected water and native saline groundwater lowry and anderson 2006 therefore the highest weighting factor 4 high significance was assigned to thickness of the aquifer m permeability m s and groundwater salinity two types of aquifers can be present in the proposed site depending on the bounding geological layers both confined and unconfined aquifers can be suitable for asr systems dillon et al 2006 but other hydrological criteria will help in the optimum asr site selection stuyfzand et al 2017 heterogeneity in aquifer s hydraulic properties and gradient would result in asr system failure if not studied carefully to ensure the movement of the injected water missimer and maliva 2010 the thickness of the unsaturated zone depth to water level should not be too high to minimize the energy costs during water recovery and not too low to ensure high recovery rates brown et al 2005 in addition as the distance to source water decrease the installation of asr system is considered least expensive and more feasible brown et al 2005 woody 2008 minsley et al 2009 therefore moderate weighting factor 3 medium significance was assigned to aquifer confinement uniformity of hydraulic properties hydraulic gradient depth to water level m predicted water supply exceeds demand and distance to source water recharge of high quality water into porous and unconsolidated aquifers are more favorable for asr systems compared to fractured and karstified aquifers the protected species and habitat as well as the nearby users wells might adversely influence the asr project woody 2008 low weighting factor 2 low significance was assigned to consolidation of the aquifer well density near the asr project recharge water quality and endangered species aerobic aquifer is more suitable for asr systems due to its less susceptibility to pathogens and bacteria of wastewater origin dillon and jiménez 2008 while aquifer mineralogy fluid rock interactions might result in unwanted results in the recovered water quality maliva et al 2007 woody 2008 therefore the very low weighting factor 1 very low significance was assigned to aquifer mineralogy and redox state of native groundwater 3 2 assigning weighting factors to each site the maximum score achieved using each criterion is the product of the weighting factor assigned for each hydrological and additional criterions by the suitability score for each discrete site the calculated score was imported to arcgis along with the study area boundary to create suitability mapping sallwey et al 2018 the score for each criterion at each site was presented using a color scale with dark green color showing the highest score and dark red color showing the lowest score thickness of the aquifer m permeability m s and groundwater salinity has the highest weighting factor which is equivalent to 4 thus the maximum score is 16 while the minimum score is 4 as shown in fig 3 for the thickness of aquifer criteria most of the sites has moderate score except three sites namely al hayer ajban and abu karrayah due to the low suitability score achieved the permeability criteria s score is high for the sites located at the east of the study area near the boundary of sultanate oman due to its unique location of the quaternary alluvium unconfined gravel aquifer while the groundwater salinity criteria score is also high at these sites due to natural recharge of the aquifer through surface and subsurface flow from al hajar mountains east of the study area and periodic storm runoff from water concentrated in wadis murad et al 2009 depth to water level uniformity of hydraulic properties and distance to source water has weighting factor equivalent to 3 thus the maximum score is 12 while the minimum score is 3 as shown in fig 4 at al khrair al dhahir remah and ajban sites the water level was encountered at depths greater than 30 m below ground level therefore these sites achieved a high score while al khrair al bateen and al quaa sites achieved a high score due to the homogeneity in the aquifer hydraulic properties in distance to source water criteria sweihan al khaznah and ayn al fayda sites achieved a high score due to their closeness to wastewater plants therefore high suitability score was assigned at these sites well density and consolidation porous non fractured has weighting factor equivalent to 2 thus the maximum score is 8 while the minimum score is 2 as shown in fig 5 all the sites are located near to water wells within 1 km radius owned by local houses and farmers near to the site thus the suitability score assigned to the sites are either 2 fair suitability or 3 good suitability the highest score was achieved at al khrair and ayn al fayda sites as they have the lowest well density for this study the highest score was achieved at al shuwaib ajban sweihan al saad al shuaibah abu karrayah and al araad sites because they are characterized by consolidated aquifer due to existence of hard materials and rocks according to well data while other sites are characterized by pervious and unconsolidated materials however both consolidated and unconsolidated aquifers have a high suitability score as both of them considered suitable for an asr system pyne 1995 woody 2008 dillon and jiménez 2008 redox state of native groundwater and aquifer mineralogy has weighting factor equivalent to 1 thus the maximum score is 4 while the minimum score is 1 as shown in fig 6 for the redox state of native groundwater criteria the suitability score assigned to the sites are either 1 poor suitability for anaerobic aquifer or 4 excellent suitability for aerobic aquifer most of the sites scored 4 except al quaa sayh al hamah and al shuwaib sites which scored 1 due to the existence of wastewater treatment plants in the vicinity which might cause contamination of the groundwater in that site if mixed with the wastewater for aquifer mineralogy criteria most of the sites scored 1 due to the quality of the groundwater which is saline and might cause unwanted deterioration of the recovered water as a result of chemical disequilibrium with the injected freshwater and might interact with the host materials while the sites that has fresh groundwater quality scored 4 due to natural purification of fine materials which characterize the aquifer at that specific location all the sites scored the same in hydraulic gradient aquifer confinement recharge water quality endangered species and predicted water supply exceeds the demand criterions the hydraulic gradient criteria are 2 fair suitability score for all sites due to moderate gradient in the study area the average westward hydraulic gradient is 0 004 based on 100 m of head change over a distance of 25 km hutchinson 1998 however according to brown et al 2005 hydraulic gradient of less than 0 001 is considered ideal for an asr system for the aquifer confinement criteria three geological layers were reported previously by usgs hutchinson 1998 and brook 2005 namely surficial aquifer sand and gravel aquifer upper fars formation and lower fars formation as evidenced by hundreds of the wells that were drilled by ndc national drilling company and usgs united states geological survey during the 1990s there is a hydrogeological connection between the bottom of the surficial aquifer and the underlain upper fars formation at the eastern part towards oman mountains sadhasivam et al 2018 therefore it was modeled that the surficial aquifer layer unconfined and highly productive quaternary alluvium and the upper fars formation is conceptualized as a one layer overlying the lower fars formation which is considered as the bottom of the aquifer or the top of the confining layer impermeable layer it was considered that groundwater recharges in an unconfined aquifer therefore all sites scored 3 good suitability which is equivalent to unconfined aquifer the recharge water quality criteria score for all sites was considered 4 excellent suitability as the aim of this study is to inject excess freshwater from desalination plants or water that meets all standards to avoid extra costs of treatment and avoid contamination of the aquifer for the endangered species criteria all sites scored 4 excellent suitability because all the sites have no adverse impact on any nearby protected species or habitat the predicted water supply exceeds the demand criteria water supply from the asr system should exceeds the water demand for successful investment therefore all sites scored 4 excellent suitability as the aim of this study is to provide the best suitable site for a long term strategic water supply 4 results and discussion the results obtained from each of the hydrological and additional components criteria are added to calculate the total score the total score is used to create final asr suitability maps of the study area two final asr suitability maps were developed based on two criteria groups the first map includes the sites ranked based on site specific hydrological criteria group that are directly related to the local aquifer characteristics and necessary for accurately selecting the potential site in terms of asr system performance the second map includes the same sites but ranked based on two criteria groups hydrological and additional components for selecting the potential site in terms of asr system performance as well as the operational and infrastructural feasibilities 4 1 results based on hydrological components the site selection procedure was applied for the 20 sites based on the most important 7 hydrological criterions to evaluate the possibility of finding potential location for an asr system the hydrological criterions is directly related to the efficiency of the asr system and will control the movement of the injected water within the aquifer storage zone brown et al 2005 maliva et al 2009 therefore site specific hydrological conditions are required for the successful implementation of the asr system the score suitability score multiplied by weighting factor at each criterion is summed up to calculate the total score out of 80 maximum possible score which will indicate the best location for a potential asr system according to the hydrological criterions the total score for the evaluated sites and its location within the study area are presented in final asr suitability map as shown in fig 7 the total score for each criterion at each site was presented using a spectral color scale with blue color showing the highest score and red color showing the lowest score the high asr suitability percentage indicates the promising site specific aquifer characteristics and the high potentiality of the site to be recharge with the sufficient water for long term storage that will fulfill the needs of water demands within the study area which is expected to increase in the future the results showed highest score in al khrair site followed by al dhahir and al shuwaib all the evaluated sites have an asr suitability greater than 61 the highest total score is al khrair and al dhahir sites which scored 91 asr suitability followed by al shuwaib site with 90 asr suitability and al bateen site with 78 asr suitability in terms of the highest significant criteria which is mostly related to aquifer such as the aquifer saturated zone permeability and groundwater salinity the sites have the following characteristics aquifer thickness is around 10 50 m which indicates good suitability score permeability ranges from 10 3 10 5 m s which indicates good to excellent suitability and fresh groundwater quality except al bateen site which fair suitability score due to its brackish saline groundwater quality 4 2 results based on hydrological and additional components another site scoring procedure based on two criteria groups divided into hydrological and additional criterions was applied on the same 20 discrete sites selected for the asr suitability assessment maximum possible total score is 160 which indicates the best location for a potential asr system considering the asr performance due to the favorable hydrological conditions brown et al 2005 woody 2008 and the operational and economic feasibility related to the additional components minsley et al 2009 the total score for the evaluated sites within the study area is shown in fig 8 fig 9 shows the total score for each criterion at each site using a spectral color scale with blue color showing the highest score and red color showing the lowest score all the evaluated sites have an asr suitability greater than 67 the highest total score is al khrair site which scored 142 out of 160 89 asr suitability followed by al dhahir site which scored 138 86 asr suitability and al shuwaib site which scored 136 85 asr suitability the highest scored three sites al khrair al dhahir and al shuwaib are located near the eastern boundary of the study area al khrair and al dhahir sites are located in al jaww plain area which is characterized by good quality water alsharhan et al 2001 due to its distinctive location which allow the area to receive a plentiful of surface and subsurface drainage from the oman mountains al hajar mountains to the east of the area while al shuwaib site is also near to al hajar mountains north of al jaww plain and have good freshwater quality the three sites achieved a high suitability score in the most significant hydrological criterions thickness of the aquifer permeability and groundwater salinity which have the highest weighting factor and directly related to the aquifer in terms of the additional components such as surface operational and infrastructural criterions most of the sites achieved good suitability score in the distance to source water criterion which have medium weighting factor while only three sites achieved better score the three sites are sweihan al khaznah and sayh al hamah which are located near to water treatment plants however the highest ranked sites are also located near to existing pumping stations in addition al khrair site achieved excellent suitability score in well density criterion which have a low significance while al shuwaib and al bateen achieved good suitability score 5 discussion in both site selection evaluations which were based on two different criteria groups the highest score in the 20 sites is achieved by al khrair site followed by al dhahir al shuwaib and al bateen sites respectively in general the total score is gradually decreasing towards the west of the study area as presented in the final suitability maps as most of the sites achieved low suitability score in groundwater salinity uniformity of hydraulic properties of the aquifer and aquifer mineralogy criterions while these sites have an intermediate suitability scores in permeability well density and depth to water level criterions in addition to the three sites with high percentage of asr suitability it was noticed that almost all sites has achieved at least 73 79 asr suitability at the north of the study area al hayer site achieved 73 asr suitability al hayer site is near to al shuwaib site and eastern boundary of the study area at the center of the study area al bateen site achieved 79 asr suitability and it is ranked fourth among the 20 evaluated sites at the west of the study area al khaznah site achieved 74 asr suitability due to its moderate to high suitability score in thickness of the aquifer and permeability criterions which have the highest weighting factor and distance to source water and depth to water level criterions which have medium weighting factor at the south of the study area al quaa site achieved 76 asr suitability due to its moderate to high suitability score in thickness of the aquifer and permeability criterions which have the highest weighting factor as well as depth to water level and uniformity of hydraulic properties of the aquifer criterions which have moderate weighting factor fig 10 compares results obtained here with other studies for the suitability of managed aquifer recharge in al ain region hutchinson 1998 dawoud 2013 sadhasivam and mohamed 2018 each study adopts different criteria for the evaluation of the best asr sites for instance environment agency abu dhabi dawoud 2013 used some hydrogeological criteria such as thickness of the aquifer thickness of the unsaturated zone aquifer confinement quality of native groundwater aquifer transmissivity and storativity hydraulic gradient and presence of third party using the aquifer in addition few other criteria such as distance to closest border or coastline infrastructure environmental aspects and land development another study of assessment of asr project in abu dhabi emirate was carried out by sadhasivam and mohamed 2018 in this investigation hydrological criteria as well as performance of each site in terms of rate of injection total volume of injection recovery efficiency radius of influence and type of cone were examined in order to find the most suitable location in abu dhabi emirates including the study area the result of the study was a general asr suitability map indicating the potential sites of asr project in abu dhabi emirates however the highest scored sites in dawoud 2013 and sadhasivam and mohamed 2018 including this study are marked in fig 9 mainly three suitable sites for an asr project in the study area were proposed previously in asr assessment studies the suitable sites in this study mainly located east of the study area al shuwaib site is located approximately near to two of the proposed sites by sadhasivam and mohamed 2018 and dawoud 2013 two of the proposed asr sites by sadhasivam and mohamed 2018 are located near al hayer site which achieved 73 asr suitability while one site by dawoud 2013 is located in al saad site which is near to the al bateen site which achieved 79 asr suitability in this study in the last decade the groundwater level in al khrair al shuwaib and al bateen sites are located within the stable groundwater zone according to the groundwater level changes map developed by ead 2018 two of the proposed asr sites by sadhasivam and mohamed 2018 are located within stable groundwater zone except site 3 which is located in an area with decline in groundwater level while sites 2 and 3 by dawoud 2013 are located close to al hayer area east of the study area and site 1 is located in the middle of the study area at al saad area were the groundwater level change is showing continuous decline an advantage of al khrair site compared to other sites is the existence of multiple pumping stations in the vicinity of the site as well as its unique site specific characteristics of the aquifer therefore al khrair site is the most favorable location for a potential asr system due to the high suitability score achieved in both criteria groups which consists of hydrological and additional components related to the local aquifer performance and other operational feasibility al shuwaib site followed by al bateen sites are considered also promising locations of a successful asr system 6 conclusion the need for an alternative approach to manage the water supply demand and provide uninterrupted freshwater supply is a major concern in the abu dhabi emirate mar is considered to have the potential to be a major contributor for water supply in semi arid and arid countries where groundwater is over exploited or saline asr site selection should be studied and planned carefully in order to minimize the potential problems and maximize the asr system performance this study analyzed 20 sites in eastern region of uae for asr suitability based on two criteria groups the first group focused on hydrological criteria which are directly related to the asr system performance the other group focused on the same hydrological criteria with additional components that will help in identifying the most feasible asr system based on the existing operational infrastructural criterions within the study area results of the final asr suitability maps showed that in both analyzed hydrological and additional components among 20 sites al khrair and al shuwaib achieved highest score the changes in groundwater level at these two sites are not significant and therefore they are located in stable groundwater zone the depth to water level for al khrair and al dhahir sites are greater than 30 m while al shuwaib and al bateen sites it ranges from 10 to 30 m therefore al khrair has promising water storage capacity followed by al shuwaib and al dhahir sites the advantage of al khrair site over other site is the existing of multiple pumping stations near the site and its location in the middle of fresh groundwater zone the asr suitability in general decreases while moving away from east of al ain to west however the highest achieved sites will be analyzed using computer software to understand the local aquifer performance and verify the capacity to store large volume of water under different scenarios that will help the water managers to take decision regarding the number of asr wells and amount of water to be stored funding this research was

11797,environmental pollution of drinking water and it s mitigation policies spose one of the most significant global sustainability challenges the remediation of pollutants from drinking water depends on technological efficacy whereas its implementation on the target population requires social acceptance besides economic resources in this context mass awareness of the benefits of community safe water supply scheme and people s willingness to use the treated water may improvise the effective implementation of the project the present research demonstrated the effectiveness of a field scale mass awareness experiment on the management of arsenic as pollution through the implementation of piped community water supply project in areas with profuse as contaminated tubewell based water use extensive baseline and end line surveys were conducted to assess the public awareness of the as issues identification of the captive population which delineates the impact of the campaign program and the associated change in behavior of the studied population lorenz curve was employed to estimate the awareness of arsenic contamination in different population clusters and it was observed that a cumulative awareness share of 96 9 was achieved in 97 5 of households hotspot analysis was conducted to identify the spatial distribution of as incidences and unresponsive captive population to awareness program a neural network based prediction model was developed integrating the baseline and end line survey data to assess the impact of the awareness program on public behavioral change on shifting to community piped water supply sources from contaminated groundwater the high value of r2 0 986 and f statistics 3721 6 signify the effective application of the model graphical abstract image 1 keywords arsenic contamination hot spots spatial analysis artificial neural network awareness program 1 introduction the scarcity of safe drinking water availability caused by rapid urbanization industrialization and environmental pollution is a global concern the primary source of freshwater resource is groundwater which is being over exploited to meet up drinking water agriculture and industrial demand consequently the presence of various contaminants of geogenic and anthropogenic origin such as arsenic fluoride iron nitrate etc restricts its usage as untreated drinking water sources without any pollutant specific treatment among them the severity of arsenic as contamination in many places across the world has been reported for several decades which demanded extensive arsenic research on geochemistry epidemiology and removal technologies arsenic is regarded as the most prevelant contaminant in natural water systems globally mukherjee et al 2021 south and east asian countries such as china india bangladesh thailand cambodia vietnam burma nepal and pakistan are affected by wide occurence of as in groundwater bhattacharya et al 1997 2011 mukherjee and fryar 2008 mukherjee et al 2008a and across various depths mukherjee et al 2011 in india the prevalence of arsenic in groundwater is found across several states mukherjee et al 2021 arsenic contamination is reported to be mostly existing in the groundwater of ganges river plains of west bengal chakraborty et al 2022 mukherjee et al 2007 some other states of india such as bihar jharkhand chattishgarh manipur assam punjab and uttar pradesh are also affected by this toxic geogenic contaminant maity et al 2021 santra and samal 2013 an estimated 220 million people across india mukherjee et al 2021 are exposed to the geogenic as pollution in their groundwater sourced drinking water similarly 90 million people are exposed to the pollution in the ganges river delta across india and bangladesh chakraborty et al 2020 2022 the median arsenic concentrations found in hair nail and skin scales of the affected inhabitants are 1700 μg kg 3480 μg kg and 7520 μg kg respectively which exceeds the standard limits of these biological samples ghosh et al 2007 rahman et al 2014 a similar study conducted by the public health engineering department phed government of west bengal with the support of unicef analyzed 29 640 tube wells sampled from 17 blocks of nadia district and reported 41 2 of the samples having as concentration more than 10 μg l nickson et al 2007 a study conducted from 2297 households of 37 villages in all 17 arsenic affected blocks of nadia district reports a maximum concentration of 1362 μg l of arsenic in drinking water mazumder et al 2010 groundwater arsenic contamination may cause severe health problems stressing socio economic factors a growing number of habitations in several developing countries worldwide suffer from several clinical manifestations of chronic arsenic poisoning including skin lesions melanosis leuco melanosis guttate melanosis keratosis blackfoot disease gangrene diabetes mellitus arsenicosis hypertension etc which are the precursors of skin cancer kidney damage neurological disorders respiratory diseases liver cancer ischemic heart disease genetic anomalies and other ailments biomarkers skin lesions rahman et al 2014 toenails and hair ghosh et al 2007 rahman et al 2014 eyes ghosh et al 2007 indicate the presence of arsenic and its health manifestations furthermore a significant share of cost incurs on medicines and loss of wages as well as the social stigma of arsenicosis leaves a debilitating impact on the affected population indu et al 2016 an economic analysis by roy 2008 reports that a representative household will be benefited by 7 per month switching the arsenic contaminated source to filtered piped water by the kolkata municipal corporation similar studies investigated that morbidity rates of arsenic affected areas are 25 higher than the national or state average 10 reddy and behera 2006 and a primary survey conducted in 2005 in dasdia nonaghata village of nadia district west bengal reported an average medical expense and wage loss of 13598 rs annually per capita indu et al 2016 the arsenic mitigation strategies consisted of a multifaceted approach including the exploration of non contaminated sources biswas et al 2012 treatment of arsenic bearing groundwater etc the changes in socio economic behavior as observed during the recent pandemic situation can further constrain drinking water availability mukherjee et al 2020 duttagupta et al 2021 however the technical financial and environmental constraints often restrict arsenic mitigation measures furthermore social awareness plays a significant role in arsenic mitigation by encouraging people to switch over to using arsenic free water in this context awareness campaigning and related behavioral change of people decide the efficacy of an arsenic remediation technique at the consumer level essentially the mass campaign program should be associated with a questionnaire survey at the different levels in the target population to decide the extent and mode of awareness management and necessary improvement thereof in different areas of pollution abatement environmental remediation implementation of technological economic or social tools awareness program is acknowledged as an efficient management practice chin et al 2019 lenzholzer et al 2020 mei et al 2016 michiko 2000 sulistyawati et al 2018 the present work intended to assess the necessity of this social management tool as an arsenic mitigation approach as the relationship between several influencing factors of behavioral management is not defined by the appropriate mathematical equations a regression based statistical approach may produce inappropriate results here the application of various machine learning ml methods can be considered as an efficient alternative which is extensively observed in various fields of industry and academia bhattacharya et al 2021 deng et al 2009 ghaedi et al 2015a ghosal and gupta 2018a 2018b ozel et al 2020 artificial neural networks ann is one of the efficient ml tools used for multivariate modeling in recent years in various areas of engineering sciences bhattacharya et al 2021 ghaedi et al 2015b ghosal and gupta 2018a 2018b karri and sahu 2018 messikh et al 2020 in the present study the application of ann on the questionnaire survey data may be considered an efficient tool for performance evaluation and decision making of the arsenic awareness program the present study targets a comprehensive assessment of the impact of the public awareness program on the behavioral change of people concerning their switchover towards arsenic free water from contaminated sources an extensive questionnaire survey was conducted to understand the impact of the mass campaign for arsenic hazard as well as the baseline and end line survey data the outcome of the baseline survey data was used to analyze the general level of awareness the socio economic profile of the residents hotspots areas of arsenic impact along with the identification of captive users on the other hand the impact of the awareness campaign was analyzed from an endline survey an ann based model was developed from the survey data to demonstrate the improved water use concerning the awareness campaign of the population in the study area which can be used as a significant tool in the similar area of behavioral change based arsenic mitigation management 2 study area the present work involves individuals reported with arsenic exposure above the permissible limit of 10 μg l in haringhata block under the kalyani subdivision of nadia district fig 1 a the geographical extent lies with the latitude of 22 57 37 8360 n and the longitude of 88 34 2 6616 e several previous publications report the ubiquitous presence of arsenic in the groundwater and its effect due to arsenic ingestion and or accumulation through the food chain in the study area considered ghosh et al 2007 rahman et al 2014 santra and samal 2013 haringhata block is spread over an area of 171 km2 where 47 5 of the land use is dedicated to vegetation and agricultural land around 96 3 of this agricultural land gets irrigated via wells tube wells and the rest from other sources like canals and tanks nearly 93 of villages use hand pumps 89 of villages use tube wells census of india 2011 most of which are contaminated with arsenic in concentration way above the permissible limits causing accumulation of this toxic heavy metal metalloid in rice 156 194 μg kg and crops 84 330 μg kg santra and samal 2013 more than 90 of the households in the study area are dependent on tube wells as their primary source of potable water based on baseline survey data these include privately installed tube wells within the premises of a household and community tube wells provided by the rural local bodies the study area reports a road density of 2 44 km of road per thousand persons which is less than the district average road density the population data from the census of india 2011 provides information of all 84 villages of the blocks where 15 613 8ha area is dedicated to residential use which houses 2 07 459 persons additionally only 73 3 of the total population are literate whereas female literacy is abysmally low 68 4 of the total female population when compared to the state s average female literacy rate low female literacy has had immense implications on a household s general health and hygiene conditions it has also been found to affect the outcome of the mass awareness programs the current study includes samples collected from 55 most affected villages out of the 83 villages in the haringhata block 3 methodology the proposed methodology for addressing the research questions posited to map the spatial patterns of consumption of arsenic contaminated water by households of a block the smallest administrative unit of executive governance in india and model the behavioral change of households from contaminated groundwater sources to safe drinking water facilities has been presented in fig 2 the effectiveness of the awareness campaign was evaluated in two phases the baseline survey and the endline survey the baseline survey was carried out using a household level questionnaire survey designed to assess the general level of social awareness regarding the quality of potable water consumed by the community it also assessed their understanding of arsenic contamination and its effects the socio economic background of the households existing conditions of water sources and the status of arsenic contamination was also gauged through a baseline survey the effects of the month long awareness campaign at the community level were recorded using the endline survey the format of the questionnaire survey at baseline and the end line stage is provided in section s1 and s2 of supplementary materials sm as indicated in fig 2 descriptive statistical techniques were employed to evaluate the parameters discussed above furthermore the understanding of the non spatial distribution using lorenz curves and gini coefficient and spatial distribution of the arsenic affected cases evaluated using the hotspot analyses which identified spatial clustering of zones depicting the pronounced impact of arsenic contamination were carried out although the lorenz curve and gini coefficient measure the distribution of a given variable they measure the overall inequality and can provide limited inputs concerning local minima or maxima in distribution spatial analysis is required to capture the essence of local variances in the distribution of a variable spatial autocorrelation and hotspot analysis are widely employed to identify clusters of a particular spatial phenomenon the locations of statistically significant spatial clusters of high values hot spots and low values cold spots are identified using vectors by aggregating points of occurrence into polygons or converging points that are in close vicinity based on a calculated critical distance in the present study getis ord gi a hot spot analysis tool from spatial analysis mapping clusters toolbox is used to map the clusters of hot spots and cold spots for each feature in the dataset with arcmap 10 8 software package based on tobler s first law of geography a statistically significant hotspot is categorized as high valued features surrounded by other features having a high value of gi statistic the local summation of the values of the target feature and its adjacent features is compared proportionally to the sum of all features to calculate gi statistic esri 2016 such that 1 g i j 1 n w i j x j x j 1 n w i j n j 1 n w 2 i j j 1 n w i j 2 n 1 where xj is defined as the attribute value for feature j wi j is the spatial weights between feature i and j and n is the number of total feature and 2 x j 1 n x j n 3 s j 1 n x j 2 n x 2 when the difference between the local sum and the expected local sum is too large to be the result of random chance a statistically significant z score results esri 2016 finally the villages located within the hot spots were delineated and socio economic variables which have a probable relationship with the occurrence of households exposed to contaminated potable water sources in the hot spots were conducted on the other hand the endline survey was conducted after one month of the extensive community level awareness campaign the data collected was used to analyze the improvement in the general awareness level of the households also hot spot analysis was performed on the households who still chose to use a contaminated source of water after the awareness campaign the awareness program consisted of several influencing variables from different aspects of technical environmental and social factors which are not related to a defined mathematical equation in this context a regression based statistical approach may not produce an efficient prediction model in the present study the prediction model was framed based on ann which learns from data instead of learning from the rules indeed ann is a computing paradigm first used in cognitive science and engineering ann is an extensive approximator has significant mapping capacity of various types of data and is less sensitive to noise and chaotic components a feed forward multi layer perceptron mlp network is employed for the multivariate nonlinear data analysis several independent parameters considered in the current study representing the input layers are population not aware of the arsenic problem main source unsafe of drinking water the share of households hhs not willing to test source for as contamination the share of hhs still using contaminated source for water the share of hhs having source contamination information before the survey income and literacy rate of the population the output layer consisted of a share of hhs reported to be of arsenic incidence as a response a shallow neural network with a single hidden layer was considered for framing the prediction model the data were distributed to a ratio of 70 15 15 in the training testing and validation sets the ann architecture is framed with one input output and hidden layer ann was performed in matlab 2019 environment mathworks 2019 a batch size of 24 and 200 epochs is considered for each model the maximum value of r2 and the minimum value of the error function are found by varying numbers of nodes in each layer moreover the analysis of variance anova is also carried out to understand the coherence between predicted values and actual values additionally significant error functions computed are as follows the sum of the square of the error sahu et al

indicated in the previous section the data obtained from the baseline survey has been analyzed based on descriptive statistical techniques it was found that nearly 48 8 of the sample households have heard about arsenic contamination whereas close to 53 of the households surveyed revealed that they were either affected or could be affected due to consumption of contaminated water and are aware of the health issues that arise due to the consumption of arsenic contaminated water however none of the sample households were aware of the long term implications e g cancer renal problems etc of consumption of arsenic laden water around 4 of the households surveyed still have to travel more than 10 min to access their primary source of water almost no households in the surveyed block use a water purifier at home close to 90 of the households expressed their willingness to participate in a community awareness program on the ill effects of arsenic contamination of potable water the average responses of the 55 villages for salient questions from baseline and endline are represented in fig 3 a and b respectively the questions are represented in section s3 and s4 in sm respectively the record of eight questions and the responses of the corresponding 55 villages are enlisted in section s5 of sm it appears from the average responses that all the villagers are aware of the word arsenic and its short term and visible health effects such as skin lesions and new warts with 100 yes as a response all the villagers are also interested to fetch safe drinking water from 5 to 10 min of walking distance however two villages bansbana malpara provided a positive response for if you know that your drinking source is arsenic contaminated then will you use this tube well indicating non availability of alternate source of water forcing the public to consume the arsenic contaminated water source the information regarding the current land resource utilization scenario of the study area is provided using a land use land cover lulc map the raster images of the study area 10m spatial resolution were downloaded from sentinel 2 satellite through copernicus hub an esa data portal furthermore band stacking was performed to bring the satellite images in their true natural color subsequently supervised classification is applied in erdas imagine 2015 to the acquired images the classification of the raster images is based on the principle of maximum likelihood parametric rule which assumes normal distribution to calculate the probability of a pixel belonging to a specific class the output of the classification is recorded into five different classes water body vegetation vacant land developed area and agriculture representing the lulc map of the study area as shown in fig 1 b as described in the previous section the satellite imagery of the study area reveals that the major share of the land resources around 76 31 is dedicated to agricultural practices and or vegetation deciduous and vacant land the baseline data collected also revealed the number of households that have reported occurrence of health issues due to consumption of contaminated water to comprehend the overall distribution pattern the lorenz curve was plotted using two variables concerning the total number of households surveyed in the block and their corresponding gini coefficient was calculated i incidence of health problems in households due to consumption of arsenic contaminated water and ii general awareness level of households about arsenic contamination the lorenz curves for the above mentioned cases are shown in fig 4 a and b it was found that there is a significant disparity in the distribution of the cases of incidence of arsenic contamination gini coefficient of 0 35 i e few villages in the study area have a disproportionately higher share of cases of arsenic contamination it was contrary to the findings of occurrence of arsenic concentration in groundwater in the block where all the 55 villages earmarked for the survey had clear indications of aggravated arsenic concentration however in the case of distribution of the level of awareness of the surveyed households it was found that there was minimal disparity gini coefficient of 0 11 and the overall level of awareness before the baseline survey was similar in the study area based on the above findings it became prudent to explore further the spatial patterns of distribution of the cases of arsenic contamination in the study area the spatial manifestations of the households reported having arsenic contamination were analyzed using spatial autocorrelation and hot spots identification tools from arcgis spatial analyst toolbox hot spot analysis was implemented to understand the spatial distribution based on the feature locations and attribute values the attribute considered for the baseline survey was the total number of incidences of arsenic cases the statistical significance of each feature is measured by z scores and p values in effect they indicate whether the observed spatial clustering of high or low values is more pronounced than one would expect in a random distribution of those same values a significant hot spot is indicated by a high z score and a low p value for a feature similarly a low negative z score and a small p value indicate a significant cold spot zhang and tripathi 2018 the intensity of the clustering is represented by the higher or lower values of z score where a z score near 0 means no spatial clustering the output map of the hot spot analysis based on the baseline survey is represented in fig 5 a and b a total of nine villages were found to create two hot spots in the study area the larger one in the northeastern corner of the study area is constituted of seven villages the villages are sekandarpur subuddipur hazrapota parulia dighalgram jalkarbhomra uttar brahmapur satsimulia and khalsi two of these villages were assigned to cluster with 99 of confidence having a z score more than 2 83 with a p value of 0 005 similarly four and three villages were clustered as hot spots for arsenic incidence with 95 and 90 confidence respectively areas that record a lower groundwater arsenic incidences compared to the expected number is categorized as cold spot and only three villages were found to be at 90 confidence with a z score less than 1 92 and p value 0 08 the summary of the findings is presented in table 1 overlaying the hot spots with the lulc map of the study area reveals that the prevalent land use land cover in the hot spot is agricultural land a significant share of land is also dedicated to surface water bodies and marshy lands rural settlements and other built up areas contribute a minuscule amount of the total land cover moreover simple correlation analyses between the incidence of arsenic contaminated cases and socio economic variables like female literacy and level of household income percentage share of bpl households reveal a positive correlation between the above variables the results from the correlation analysis are presented in table 2 female literacy can be attributed to a strong relationship r2 0 7 with the incidence of arsenic contamination cases in the villages located in the hot spots also a hotspot analysis was carried out to check for pieces of evidence of spatial clustering of households using unsafe drinking water sources during the baseline survey the results reveal that the six villages in the northeast corner of the study area demonstrate a hot spot this hotspot closely matches the spatial clustering pattern of arsenic contamination cases in the study area likewise analyses were carried out with the data obtained from the endline survey it was found that 11 of households in the study area constituting 26 villages still rely on their existing sources without feeling the need to check for the arsenic concentration of water produced by these sources mostly tube wells also 9 of households spread across 15 villages of the study area continue to use contaminated water sources even after the campaign these households behave like captive users because of several constraining factors like access to safe water sources being far away risk homeostasis perception of risk from water laden with arsenic is still low and other socio economic conditions like literacy since the number of arsenic contamination cases is not likely to change immediately after the awareness campaign the share of households continuing to use unsafe sources of potable water after the completion of the awareness campaign was taken as the marker for the efficacy of the campaign a hot spot analysis with the above variable i e share of households using an unsafe source of potable water was carried out it was found that three villages emerge as discrete hot spots namely bamanberia malidanga and tahnsara the output from the hot spot analysis is presented in fig 5 c the z scores for bamanberia and malidanga village found to be 1 72 and there was a less than 7 likelihood p value 0 07 that these clustered patterns could result out of a random chance for 95 and 90 confidence thus making these villages statistically significant hot spots table 1 however the above mentioned villages are sporadically spread around the southern part of the study area thus it may be inferred that the villages mentioned above are captive to the contaminated sources available and the awareness program alone cannot persuade the population to shift their respective contaminated source of drinking water to a safe one the ann study was performed with 55 numbers of the dataset optimum ann architecture arrived with the variation of numbers of neurons and three transfer functions as shown in fig 6 a the number of neurons in the hidden layer was varied from 1 to 20 until an optimum number of values arrived at 16 with the least rmse of 2 506 and maximum r2 of 0 986 the correlation coefficient concerning the training testing validation and overall model is presented in fig 6 b the high r value corresponding to testing and validation along with its overall value represents the significant adequacy of the model in demonstrating the dataset the transfer functions for the variables and response are chosen as purelin linear function log sigmoid and tangent sigmoid non linear sigmoid which alters the desired conversion of processed input variables in the hidden layer to formulate a suitable transformation in the hidden layer the tangent sigmoid function exhibited the most efficient transfer function for the optimum network the error functions associated with the simulated data of the overall set were computed and presented in table 3 the mse mae and χ2 values observed for the overall model are 6 28 1 80 and 13 08 respectively which exhibited comparatively lower values of error functions anova was carried out on observed and predicted values table 4 the adequacy of the model was characterized by a higher f value 3721 636 and lesser p value 0 001 indicating the significance of the model the regression statistics r2 0 986 and adjusted r2 0 986 represent significant model fit overall the developed ann model represents an appropriate tool delineating several factors of baseline and endline survey as well as predicting the impact of arsenic awareness targeting the arsenic remediation furthermore the prediction model was further utilized to demonstrate the impact of increased awareness and its role on arsenic mitigation the number of population not aware of the presence of arsenic in groundwater is assumed to be decreased in the entire data set to assess the impact of the awareness campaign the corresponding increase in the share of hhs reported to be of arsenic incidence was drastically decreased the prediction model exhibited that decrease of population unaware of the arsenic presence by 10 keeping all other variables constant results in increased awareness of 7 14 thus the model can prove a positive impact on arsenic awareness in the study area 5 conclusion the present research explores the role of management strategies like awareness campaigns in attenuating the incidences of arsenic contamination in the rural groudnwater supply these strategies aim at changing user behavior and attitude towards the potential risk posed by consumption of as contaminated water the study was carried out in two phases constituting baseline and endline surveys in the 55 most affected villages of the haringhata block nadia district of west bengal the community level awareness campaign was carried out in between these two phases the baseline survey revealed that households were not aware of the long term implications of arsenic pollution on human health spatially analyzsese of the data identified hotspots of high incidences of as contamination cases seven villages created a larger hot spot on the northeastern side of the study area and it was found that female literacy and household income had a positive correlation with the incidence of such cases in these locations after the endline survey it was found that the general level of awareness has increased in the study area however few villages continued to use contaminated water due to certain limiting conditions like access to safer sources or socio economic conditions an ann based prediction model was designed based on the awareness level of the households and other limiting conditions such as the primary source of potable water and access to potable water overall it can be inferred in response to the research questions posited in this study that there are spatial manifestations of arsenic contaminations in the study area which were primarily hinted at other socio economic conditions a detailed timeline study can lead to conclusive evidence on the causality of such spatial manifestations secondly it was inferred that management strategies like awareness campaigns serve their purpose in such rural settings but are conditional to socio economic factors like female literacy income etc further research needs to address the role of social networks in such rural settings in creating user preferences or attitudes toward such societal problems albeit these problems have been addressed with a prevalent engineering perspective however with changing times more research needs to be directed towards social constraints in technology adoption particularly in the rural setting of developing nations

11797,environmental pollution of drinking water and it s mitigation policies spose one of the most significant global sustainability challenges the remediation of pollutants from drinking water depends on technological efficacy whereas its implementation on the target population requires social acceptance besides economic resources in this context mass awareness of the benefits of community safe water supply scheme and people s willingness to use the treated water may improvise the effective implementation of the project the present research demonstrated the effectiveness of a field scale mass awareness experiment on the management of arsenic as pollution through the implementation of piped community water supply project in areas with profuse as contaminated tubewell based water use extensive baseline and end line surveys were conducted to assess the public awareness of the as issues identification of the captive population which delineates the impact of the campaign program and the associated change in behavior of the studied population lorenz curve was employed to estimate the awareness of arsenic contamination in different population clusters and it was observed that a cumulative awareness share of 96 9 was achieved in 97 5 of households hotspot analysis was conducted to identify the spatial distribution of as incidences and unresponsive captive population to awareness program a neural network based prediction model was developed integrating the baseline and end line survey data to assess the impact of the awareness program on public behavioral change on shifting to community piped water supply sources from contaminated groundwater the high value of r2 0 986 and f statistics 3721 6 signify the effective application of the model graphical abstract image 1 keywords arsenic contamination hot spots spatial analysis artificial neural network awareness program 1 introduction the scarcity of safe drinking water availability caused by rapid urbanization industrialization and environmental pollution is a global concern the primary source of freshwater resource is groundwater which is being over exploited to meet up drinking water agriculture and industrial demand consequently the presence of various contaminants of geogenic and anthropogenic origin such as arsenic fluoride iron nitrate etc restricts its usage as untreated drinking water sources without any pollutant specific treatment among them the severity of arsenic as contamination in many places across the world has been reported for several decades which demanded extensive arsenic research on geochemistry epidemiology and removal technologies arsenic is regarded as the most prevelant contaminant in natural water systems globally mukherjee et al 2021 south and east asian countries such as china india bangladesh thailand cambodia vietnam burma nepal and pakistan are affected by wide occurence of as in groundwater bhattacharya et al 1997 2011 mukherjee and fryar 2008 mukherjee et al 2008a and across various depths mukherjee et al 2011 in india the prevalence of arsenic in groundwater is found across several states mukherjee et al 2021 arsenic contamination is reported to be mostly existing in the groundwater of ganges river plains of west bengal chakraborty et al 2022 mukherjee et al 2007 some other states of india such as bihar jharkhand chattishgarh manipur assam punjab and uttar pradesh are also affected by this toxic geogenic contaminant maity et al 2021 santra and samal 2013 an estimated 220 million people across india mukherjee et al 2021 are exposed to the geogenic as pollution in their groundwater sourced drinking water similarly 90 million people are exposed to the pollution in the ganges river delta across india and bangladesh chakraborty et al 2020 2022 the median arsenic concentrations found in hair nail and skin scales of the affected inhabitants are 1700 μg kg 3480 μg kg and 7520 μg kg respectively which exceeds the standard limits of these biological samples ghosh et al 2007 rahman et al 2014 a similar study conducted by the public health engineering department phed government of west bengal with the support of unicef analyzed 29 640 tube wells sampled from 17 blocks of nadia district and reported 41 2 of the samples having as concentration more than 10 μg l nickson et al 2007 a study conducted from 2297 households of 37 villages in all 17 arsenic affected blocks of nadia district reports a maximum concentration of 1362 μg l of arsenic in drinking water mazumder et al 2010 groundwater arsenic contamination may cause severe health problems stressing socio economic factors a growing number of habitations in several developing countries worldwide suffer from several clinical manifestations of chronic arsenic poisoning including skin lesions melanosis leuco melanosis guttate melanosis keratosis blackfoot disease gangrene diabetes mellitus arsenicosis hypertension etc which are the precursors of skin cancer kidney damage neurological disorders respiratory diseases liver cancer ischemic heart disease genetic anomalies and other ailments biomarkers skin lesions rahman et al 2014 toenails and hair ghosh et al 2007 rahman et al 2014 eyes ghosh et al 2007 indicate the presence of arsenic and its health manifestations furthermore a significant share of cost incurs on medicines and loss of wages as well as the social stigma of arsenicosis leaves a debilitating impact on the affected population indu et al 2016 an economic analysis by roy 2008 reports that a representative household will be benefited by 7 per month switching the arsenic contaminated source to filtered piped water by the kolkata municipal corporation similar studies investigated that morbidity rates of arsenic affected areas are 25 higher than the national or state average 10 reddy and behera 2006 and a primary survey conducted in 2005 in dasdia nonaghata village of nadia district west bengal reported an average medical expense and wage loss of 13598 rs annually per capita indu et al 2016 the arsenic mitigation strategies consisted of a multifaceted approach including the exploration of non contaminated sources biswas et al 2012 treatment of arsenic bearing groundwater etc the changes in socio economic behavior as observed during the recent pandemic situation can further constrain drinking water availability mukherjee et al 2020 duttagupta et al 2021 however the technical financial and environmental constraints often restrict arsenic mitigation measures furthermore social awareness plays a significant role in arsenic mitigation by encouraging people to switch over to using arsenic free water in this context awareness campaigning and related behavioral change of people decide the efficacy of an arsenic remediation technique at the consumer level essentially the mass campaign program should be associated with a questionnaire survey at the different levels in the target population to decide the extent and mode of awareness management and necessary improvement thereof in different areas of pollution abatement environmental remediation implementation of technological economic or social tools awareness program is acknowledged as an efficient management practice chin et al 2019 lenzholzer et al 2020 mei et al 2016 michiko 2000 sulistyawati et al 2018 the present work intended to assess the necessity of this social management tool as an arsenic mitigation approach as the relationship between several influencing factors of behavioral management is not defined by the appropriate mathematical equations a regression based statistical approach may produce inappropriate results here the application of various machine learning ml methods can be considered as an efficient alternative which is extensively observed in various fields of industry and academia bhattacharya et al 2021 deng et al 2009 ghaedi et al 2015a ghosal and gupta 2018a 2018b ozel et al 2020 artificial neural networks ann is one of the efficient ml tools used for multivariate modeling in recent years in various areas of engineering sciences bhattacharya et al 2021 ghaedi et al 2015b ghosal and gupta 2018a 2018b karri and sahu 2018 messikh et al 2020 in the present study the application of ann on the questionnaire survey data may be considered an efficient tool for performance evaluation and decision making of the arsenic awareness program the present study targets a comprehensive assessment of the impact of the public awareness program on the behavioral change of people concerning their switchover towards arsenic free water from contaminated sources an extensive questionnaire survey was conducted to understand the impact of the mass campaign for arsenic hazard as well as the baseline and end line survey data the outcome of the baseline survey data was used to analyze the general level of awareness the socio economic profile of the residents hotspots areas of arsenic impact along with the identification of captive users on the other hand the impact of the awareness campaign was analyzed from an endline survey an ann based model was developed from the survey data to demonstrate the improved water use concerning the awareness campaign of the population in the study area which can be used as a significant tool in the similar area of behavioral change based arsenic mitigation management 2 study area the present work involves individuals reported with arsenic exposure above the permissible limit of 10 μg l in haringhata block under the kalyani subdivision of nadia district fig 1 a the geographical extent lies with the latitude of 22 57 37 8360 n and the longitude of 88 34 2 6616 e several previous publications report the ubiquitous presence of arsenic in the groundwater and its effect due to arsenic ingestion and or accumulation through the food chain in the study area considered ghosh et al 2007 rahman et al 2014 santra and samal 2013 haringhata block is spread over an area of 171 km2 where 47 5 of the land use is dedicated to vegetation and agricultural land around 96 3 of this agricultural land gets irrigated via wells tube wells and the rest from other sources like canals and tanks nearly 93 of villages use hand pumps 89 of villages use tube wells census of india 2011 most of which are contaminated with arsenic in concentration way above the permissible limits causing accumulation of this toxic heavy metal metalloid in rice 156 194 μg kg and crops 84 330 μg kg santra and samal 2013 more than 90 of the households in the study area are dependent on tube wells as their primary source of potable water based on baseline survey data these include privately installed tube wells within the premises of a household and community tube wells provided by the rural local bodies the study area reports a road density of 2 44 km of road per thousand persons which is less than the district average road density the population data from the census of india 2011 provides information of all 84 villages of the blocks where 15 613 8ha area is dedicated to residential use which houses 2 07 459 persons additionally only 73 3 of the total population are literate whereas female literacy is abysmally low 68 4 of the total female population when compared to the state s average female literacy rate low female literacy has had immense implications on a household s general health and hygiene conditions it has also been found to affect the outcome of the mass awareness programs the current study includes samples collected from 55 most affected villages out of the 83 villages in the haringhata block 3 methodology the proposed methodology for addressing the research questions posited to map the spatial patterns of consumption of arsenic contaminated water by households of a block the smallest administrative unit of executive governance in india and model the behavioral change of households from contaminated groundwater sources to safe drinking water facilities has been presented in fig 2 the effectiveness of the awareness campaign was evaluated in two phases the baseline survey and the endline survey the baseline survey was carried out using a household level questionnaire survey designed to assess the general level of social awareness regarding the quality of potable water consumed by the community it also assessed their understanding of arsenic contamination and its effects the socio economic background of the households existing conditions of water sources and the status of arsenic contamination was also gauged through a baseline survey the effects of the month long awareness campaign at the community level were recorded using the endline survey the format of the questionnaire survey at baseline and the end line stage is provided in section s1 and s2 of supplementary materials sm as indicated in fig 2 descriptive statistical techniques were employed to evaluate the parameters discussed above furthermore the understanding of the non spatial distribution using lorenz curves and gini coefficient and spatial distribution of the arsenic affected cases evaluated using the hotspot analyses which identified spatial clustering of zones depicting the pronounced impact of arsenic contamination were carried out although the lorenz curve and gini coefficient measure the distribution of a given variable they measure the overall inequality and can provide limited inputs concerning local minima or maxima in distribution spatial analysis is required to capture the essence of local variances in the distribution of a variable spatial autocorrelation and hotspot analysis are widely employed to identify clusters of a particular spatial phenomenon the locations of statistically significant spatial clusters of high values hot spots and low values cold spots are identified using vectors by aggregating points of occurrence into polygons or converging points that are in close vicinity based on a calculated critical distance in the present study getis ord gi a hot spot analysis tool from spatial analysis mapping clusters toolbox is used to map the clusters of hot spots and cold spots for each feature in the dataset with arcmap 10 8 software package based on tobler s first law of geography a statistically significant hotspot is categorized as high valued features surrounded by other features having a high value of gi statistic the local summation of the values of the target feature and its adjacent features is compared proportionally to the sum of all features to calculate gi statistic esri 2016 such that 1 g i j 1 n w i j x j x j 1 n w i j n j 1 n w 2 i j j 1 n w i j 2 n 1 where xj is defined as the attribute value for feature j wi j is the spatial weights between feature i and j and n is the number of total feature and 2 x j 1 n x j n 3 s j 1 n x j 2 n x 2 when the difference between the local sum and the expected local sum is too large to be the result of random chance a statistically significant z score results esri 2016 finally the villages located within the hot spots were delineated and socio economic variables which have a probable relationship with the occurrence of households exposed to contaminated potable water sources in the hot spots were conducted on the other hand the endline survey was conducted after one month of the extensive community level awareness campaign the data collected was used to analyze the improvement in the general awareness level of the households also hot spot analysis was performed on the households who still chose to use a contaminated source of water after the awareness campaign the awareness program consisted of several influencing variables from different aspects of technical environmental and social factors which are not related to a defined mathematical equation in this context a regression based statistical approach may not produce an efficient prediction model in the present study the prediction model was framed based on ann which learns from data instead of learning from the rules indeed ann is a computing paradigm first used in cognitive science and engineering ann is an extensive approximator has significant mapping capacity of various types of data and is less sensitive to noise and chaotic components a feed forward multi layer perceptron mlp network is employed for the multivariate nonlinear data analysis several independent parameters considered in the current study representing the input layers are population not aware of the arsenic problem main source unsafe of drinking water the share of households hhs not willing to test source for as contamination the share of hhs still using contaminated source for water the share of hhs having source contamination information before the survey income and literacy rate of the population the output layer consisted of a share of hhs reported to be of arsenic incidence as a response a shallow neural network with a single hidden layer was considered for framing the prediction model the data were distributed to a ratio of 70 15 15 in the training testing and validation sets the ann architecture is framed with one input output and hidden layer ann was performed in matlab 2019 environment mathworks 2019 a batch size of 24 and 200 epochs is considered for each model the maximum value of r2 and the minimum value of the error function are found by varying numbers of nodes in each layer moreover the analysis of variance anova is also carried out to understand the coherence between predicted values and actual values additionally significant error functions computed are as follows the sum of the square of the error sahu et al

indicated in the previous section the data obtained from the baseline survey has been analyzed based on descriptive statistical techniques it was found that nearly 48 8 of the sample households have heard about arsenic contamination whereas close to 53 of the households surveyed revealed that they were either affected or could be affected due to consumption of contaminated water and are aware of the health issues that arise due to the consumption of arsenic contaminated water however none of the sample households were aware of the long term implications e g cancer renal problems etc of consumption of arsenic laden water around 4 of the households surveyed still have to travel more than 10 min to access their primary source of water almost no households in the surveyed block use a water purifier at home close to 90 of the households expressed their willingness to participate in a community awareness program on the ill effects of arsenic contamination of potable water the average responses of the 55 villages for salient questions from baseline and endline are represented in fig 3 a and b respectively the questions are represented in section s3 and s4 in sm respectively the record of eight questions and the responses of the corresponding 55 villages are enlisted in section s5 of sm it appears from the average responses that all the villagers are aware of the word arsenic and its short term and visible health effects such as skin lesions and new warts with 100 yes as a response all the villagers are also interested to fetch safe drinking water from 5 to 10 min of walking distance however two villages bansbana malpara provided a positive response for if you know that your drinking source is arsenic contaminated then will you use this tube well indicating non availability of alternate source of water forcing the public to consume the arsenic contaminated water source the information regarding the current land resource utilization scenario of the study area is provided using a land use land cover lulc map the raster images of the study area 10m spatial resolution were downloaded from sentinel 2 satellite through copernicus hub an esa data portal furthermore band stacking was performed to bring the satellite images in their true natural color subsequently supervised classification is applied in erdas imagine 2015 to the acquired images the classification of the raster images is based on the principle of maximum likelihood parametric rule which assumes normal distribution to calculate the probability of a pixel belonging to a specific class the output of the classification is recorded into five different classes water body vegetation vacant land developed area and agriculture representing the lulc map of the study area as shown in fig 1 b as described in the previous section the satellite imagery of the study area reveals that the major share of the land resources around 76 31 is dedicated to agricultural practices and or vegetation deciduous and vacant land the baseline data collected also revealed the number of households that have reported occurrence of health issues due to consumption of contaminated water to comprehend the overall distribution pattern the lorenz curve was plotted using two variables concerning the total number of households surveyed in the block and their corresponding gini coefficient was calculated i incidence of health problems in households due to consumption of arsenic contaminated water and ii general awareness level of households about arsenic contamination the lorenz curves for the above mentioned cases are shown in fig 4 a and b it was found that there is a significant disparity in the distribution of the cases of incidence of arsenic contamination gini coefficient of 0 35 i e few villages in the study area have a disproportionately higher share of cases of arsenic contamination it was contrary to the findings of occurrence of arsenic concentration in groundwater in the block where all the 55 villages earmarked for the survey had clear indications of aggravated arsenic concentration however in the case of distribution of the level of awareness of the surveyed households it was found that there was minimal disparity gini coefficient of 0 11 and the overall level of awareness before the baseline survey was similar in the study area based on the above findings it became prudent to explore further the spatial patterns of distribution of the cases of arsenic contamination in the study area the spatial manifestations of the households reported having arsenic contamination were analyzed using spatial autocorrelation and hot spots identification tools from arcgis spatial analyst toolbox hot spot analysis was implemented to understand the spatial distribution based on the feature locations and attribute values the attribute considered for the baseline survey was the total number of incidences of arsenic cases the statistical significance of each feature is measured by z scores and p values in effect they indicate whether the observed spatial clustering of high or low values is more pronounced than one would expect in a random distribution of those same values a significant hot spot is indicated by a high z score and a low p value for a feature similarly a low negative z score and a small p value indicate a significant cold spot zhang and tripathi 2018 the intensity of the clustering is represented by the higher or lower values of z score where a z score near 0 means no spatial clustering the output map of the hot spot analysis based on the baseline survey is represented in fig 5 a and b a total of nine villages were found to create two hot spots in the study area the larger one in the northeastern corner of the study area is constituted of seven villages the villages are sekandarpur subuddipur hazrapota parulia dighalgram jalkarbhomra uttar brahmapur satsimulia and khalsi two of these villages were assigned to cluster with 99 of confidence having a z score more than 2 83 with a p value of 0 005 similarly four and three villages were clustered as hot spots for arsenic incidence with 95 and 90 confidence respectively areas that record a lower groundwater arsenic incidences compared to the expected number is categorized as cold spot and only three villages were found to be at 90 confidence with a z score less than 1 92 and p value 0 08 the summary of the findings is presented in table 1 overlaying the hot spots with the lulc map of the study area reveals that the prevalent land use land cover in the hot spot is agricultural land a significant share of land is also dedicated to surface water bodies and marshy lands rural settlements and other built up areas contribute a minuscule amount of the total land cover moreover simple correlation analyses between the incidence of arsenic contaminated cases and socio economic variables like female literacy and level of household income percentage share of bpl households reveal a positive correlation between the above variables the results from the correlation analysis are presented in table 2 female literacy can be attributed to a strong relationship r2 0 7 with the incidence of arsenic contamination cases in the villages located in the hot spots also a hotspot analysis was carried out to check for pieces of evidence of spatial clustering of households using unsafe drinking water sources during the baseline survey the results reveal that the six villages in the northeast corner of the study area demonstrate a hot spot this hotspot closely matches the spatial clustering pattern of arsenic contamination cases in the study area likewise analyses were carried out with the data obtained from the endline survey it was found that 11 of households in the study area constituting 26 villages still rely on their existing sources without feeling the need to check for the arsenic concentration of water produced by these sources mostly tube wells also 9 of households spread across 15 villages of the study area continue to use contaminated water sources even after the campaign these households behave like captive users because of several constraining factors like access to safe water sources being far away risk homeostasis perception of risk from water laden with arsenic is still low and other socio economic conditions like literacy since the number of arsenic contamination cases is not likely to change immediately after the awareness campaign the share of households continuing to use unsafe sources of potable water after the completion of the awareness campaign was taken as the marker for the efficacy of the campaign a hot spot analysis with the above variable i e share of households using an unsafe source of potable water was carried out it was found that three villages emerge as discrete hot spots namely bamanberia malidanga and tahnsara the output from the hot spot analysis is presented in fig 5 c the z scores for bamanberia and malidanga village found to be 1 72 and there was a less than 7 likelihood p value 0 07 that these clustered patterns could result out of a random chance for 95 and 90 confidence thus making these villages statistically significant hot spots table 1 however the above mentioned villages are sporadically spread around the southern part of the study area thus it may be inferred that the villages mentioned above are captive to the contaminated sources available and the awareness program alone cannot persuade the population to shift their respective contaminated source of drinking water to a safe one the ann study was performed with 55 numbers of the dataset optimum ann architecture arrived with the variation of numbers of neurons and three transfer functions as shown in fig 6 a the number of neurons in the hidden layer was varied from 1 to 20 until an optimum number of values arrived at 16 with the least rmse of 2 506 and maximum r2 of 0 986 the correlation coefficient concerning the training testing validation and overall model is presented in fig 6 b the high r value corresponding to testing and validation along with its overall value represents the significant adequacy of the model in demonstrating the dataset the transfer functions for the variables and response are chosen as purelin linear function log sigmoid and tangent sigmoid non linear sigmoid which alters the desired conversion of processed input variables in the hidden layer to formulate a suitable transformation in the hidden layer the tangent sigmoid function exhibited the most efficient transfer function for the optimum network the error functions associated with the simulated data of the overall set were computed and presented in table 3 the mse mae and χ2 values observed for the overall model are 6 28 1 80 and 13 08 respectively which exhibited comparatively lower values of error functions anova was carried out on observed and predicted values table 4 the adequacy of the model was characterized by a higher f value 3721 636 and lesser p value 0 001 indicating the significance of the model the regression statistics r2 0 986 and adjusted r2 0 986 represent significant model fit overall the developed ann model represents an appropriate tool delineating several factors of baseline and endline survey as well as predicting the impact of arsenic awareness targeting the arsenic remediation furthermore the prediction model was further utilized to demonstrate the impact of increased awareness and its role on arsenic mitigation the number of population not aware of the presence of arsenic in groundwater is assumed to be decreased in the entire data set to assess the impact of the awareness campaign the corresponding increase in the share of hhs reported to be of arsenic incidence was drastically decreased the prediction model exhibited that decrease of population unaware of the arsenic presence by 10 keeping all other variables constant results in increased awareness of 7 14 thus the model can prove a positive impact on arsenic awareness in the study area 5 conclusion the present research explores the role of management strategies like awareness campaigns in attenuating the incidences of arsenic contamination in the rural groudnwater supply these strategies aim at changing user behavior and attitude towards the potential risk posed by consumption of as contaminated water the study was carried out in two phases constituting baseline and endline surveys in the 55 most affected villages of the haringhata block nadia district of west bengal the community level awareness campaign was carried out in between these two phases the baseline survey revealed that households were not aware of the long term implications of arsenic pollution on human health spatially analyzsese of the data identified hotspots of high incidences of as contamination cases seven villages created a larger hot spot on the northeastern side of the study area and it was found that female literacy and household income had a positive correlation with the incidence of such cases in these locations after the endline survey it was found that the general level of awareness has increased in the study area however few villages continued to use contaminated water due to certain limiting conditions like access to safer sources or socio economic conditions an ann based prediction model was designed based on the awareness level of the households and other limiting conditions such as the primary source of potable water and access to potable water overall it can be inferred in response to the research questions posited in this study that there are spatial manifestations of arsenic contaminations in the study area which were primarily hinted at other socio economic conditions a detailed timeline study can lead to conclusive evidence on the causality of such spatial manifestations secondly it was inferred that management strategies like awareness campaigns serve their purpose in such rural settings but are conditional to socio economic factors like female literacy income etc further research needs to address the role of social networks in such rural settings in creating user preferences or attitudes toward such societal problems albeit these problems have been addressed with a prevalent engineering perspective however with changing times more research needs to be directed towards social constraints in technology adoption particularly in the rural setting of developing nations

11798,groundwater arsenic contamination has been a global threat due to its pernicious health impacts on people many studies have revealed the status of severe arsenic contamination and its health hazards in many districts in terai region of nepal of the many technologies available for arsenic treatment very few are suitable for rural terai region and the most widely used kanchan arsenic filters kaf have shown inefficient performance by recent studies depicting the need for enhancement of existing filters or finding better alternatives this study suggests a better method of arsenic treatment using laterite soil as an efficient adsorbent batch study done with adsorbent treated laterite dose kept in between 0 40 g l at lab temperature 25 2 c showed the most efficient optimum particle size for treated laterite as 0 165 mm adsorbent dose 40 g l and detention time 4 h with initial arsenic concentration of 1000 μg l the maximum removal of as iii 98 84 and as v 99 66 was observed near ph value of 8 and 3 respectively the overall reaction was observed to follow pseudo second order kinetics and langmuir isotherm curve was best fit for the process data with the highest regression coefficient r2 0 99 fixed bed column study was also conducted to access the quality and applicability of laterite soil as filter media for a newly proposed system the modification viability of existing filter by adding beds of activated carbon and acid activated laterite for enhancing performance are discussed as well as its application in a new filter system is proposed graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater treated laterite adsorbent arsenic removal efficient filter activated charcoal 1 introduction arsenic is a deleterious contaminant that occurs in groundwater aquifers through natural as well as artificial processes and has already impacted on lives of millions of people worldwide rahaman et al 2021 basically there are four oxidation states of arsenic in nature prevalent as arsine as iii arsenic as 0 arsenite as iii and arsenate as v the abundance of one species over another depends upon the oxidizing or reducing nature of existing environment commonly arsenate as v is facilitated in aerobic environment in forms of h2aso4 and haso42 and arsenite as iii in anoxic environments as h3aso3 and h2aso3 reid et al 2020 currently 94 to 200 million people are estimated to be at high risk of groundwater arsenic contamination of which major population lies in asia podgorski and berg 2020 herath et al 2016 with nepal being one of the countries reported for having high degree of arsenic as contamination shrestha et al 2003 timalsina et al 2021 our study focuses on the available arsenic removal technologies their performance and enhancement in removal efficiency in the arsenic filters widely used in nepal see tables 1 3 the who guideline suggests the safe as limit value in drinking water to be 10 ppb however a higher value of 50 ppb has been standardized in developing countries with higher concentration of arsenic contamination due to constraints associated with their removal the general concentration of as in groundwater lies in the range of 1 10 μg l but reports from 70 countries shows contamination exceeding 1000 μg l singh et al 2015 kumar and singh 2020 a collaboration between nasc and environment public health organization enpho which tested 18 635 tube wells 20 terai district illustrated that nawalparasi rupandehi bara and rautahat are the major districts having high fatal doses of arsenic and exceeding the nepal drinking water quality standards ndwqs guidelines yadav et al 2012 arsenic concentration up to 2620 μg l has been reported in groundwater of terai region of nepal the status of groundwater arsenic contamination in nepal supplementary material fig a 1 demonstrates most of the districts of terai region of nepal have arsenic concentration above the permissible limit since the majority of population of nepal reside in terai region and most of them are directly dependent upon highly contaminated groundwater for agricultural as well as domestic purposes a serious threat is posed upon the health of people timalsina et al 2021 therefore it is not just a duty but priority to treat the arsenic contaminated groundwater supply and bring it within the safe limit the groundwater arsenic carves many origin with both natural and artificial sources such as industrial landfills pesticides fuel burns holocene aquifers bhattacharya et al 2004 reducing aquifers bhattacharya et al 2003 mining leachate microbial oxidation weathering bundschuh et al 2010 and pyrite dissolution ali et al 2019 podgorski and berg 2020 ahmad et al 2020a 2020b 2020c the arsenic contamination has been attributed as an eroded product of perennial rivers that scour the crystalline peraluminous leucogranites derived from the metasedimentary crustal protoliths at higher himalayas and transmit it along with other trace elements to the gangetic plains mueller 2018 where low scale effects of lesser as dose involves pain in abdomen nausea and vomiting diarrhea loss of appetite and hairfall the exposure to higher doses on a long term basis leads to slow but gradual leukomelanosite failure of organs arsenicosis bhattacharya et al 2007 skin pigmentation peripheral neuropathy sister chromatid exchange hyperkeratosis and encephalopathy bhowmick et al 2018 annaduzzaman et al 2018 and cancer after series of hypo hyper methylation on dna mohora et al 2018 ahmad et al 2020a 2020b 2020c similarly organic species is more toxic than inorganic species of arsenic and arsenite has been reported to be 60 times more toxic than arsenate ayub h 2020 therefore there is utmost necessity of removing arsenic from groundwater before use many techniques of treating arsenic from contaminated groundwater includes membrane technology alka et al 2021a 2021b nanoparticles raval and kumar 2021 coagulation and flocculation moreira et al 2021 co precipitation razzak et al 2021 ahmad et al 2020a 2020b 2020c adsorption dhanasekaran and sahu 2021 ultra filtration yaqub and lee 2020 reverse osmosis chen et al 2020 ion exchange rathi et al 2021 ozone oxidation liu and qu 2021 bioremediation hubadillah et al 2020 and electrochemical treatment syam babu and nidheesh 2021 after analyzing the technical shortcomings removal efficiency economic considerations local availability etc of all the available treatment processes adsorption is seen as the most economic and efficient process to remove arsenic alka et al 2021a 2021b moreover aluminum and iron based sorption are considered as the excellent and the most widely accepted and followed adsorption techniques used in household as well as commercially timalsina et al 2021 the arsenic filters are constructed with further modifications to meet the demands quality standards of drinking water the arsenic filter should be economical efficient easily constructed with locally available materials socially accepted convenient for operation and maintenance especially in terai region of nepal it should have a rural focus and very straightforward to use timalsina et al 2021 among the several arsenic filters proposed by different organizations jerry can system 2 kolshi filter 3 kolshi filter and kanchan arsenic filter kaf are the most popular ones and reasonably suitable the review of pilot studies by timalsina et al 2021 showed kaf stands at the top in terms of efficiency of pathogens iron and arsenic removal cost of construction and maintenance omitting use of chemicals coagulants and thus is the most commonly used arsenic filter in nepal kaf is a modified bio sand filter designed to remove arsenic and pathogens simultaneously it consists of gravel sand and innovative diffuser basin containing iron nails brick chips and raw water from bottom to top cased inside plastic or cement concrete container ngai et al 2006 2007 in the kaf non galvanized iron nails are exposed to air and water rusting quickly and producing ferric hydroxide on the iron nails surface when arsenic containing water is poured into the filter arsenic is rapidly adsorbed onto the surface of the ferric hydroxide brick chips are used for uniform diffusion of raw water so as to prevent dislocation of iron nails the iron particles loaded with as is then trapped in the small pores of sand layer below by physical straining phenomena moreover pathogens also get trapped in the sand layer and consequently get removed from the water ngai et al 2006 2007 technical evaluation by ngai et al 2007 demonstrated the removal rate of 85 90 arsenic 90 95 iron 80 95 turbidity and 85 99 of total coliforms at the design and installation phase however an independent study regarding assessment of performance of kafs deployed in 62 households reported that only 54 of kafs reduced the high arsenic level to safe limit singh et al 2014 according to which gem 505 model of filter was seen to reduce groundwater influent with as contaminant as high as 400 μg l of total arsenic 80 20 ratio of as iii as v to 50 μg l of total arsenic thus showing only 85 90 removal rate singh et al 2014 the study by ogata et al 2020 also depicts inadequacy of performance of kaf as the removal of as was only 75 and 38 of the samples could not meet safety standards moreover kafs were observed to have a lower fe dose relatively shorter retention time higher concentration of trace elements and dissolved solids in effluent dry nail bed layer poor maintenance and higher operation ph which further lowered its overall efficacy mueller et al 2020 further the x ray inspections of prearranged nails from some kanchan filters showed the formation of siderite on the surface at higher temperature which stated the fact that at terai region in hot and humid climate exceeding 40 c in summer the so formed siderite will cover the nail surface in diffusion basin sealing it off for further as adsorption also the review on efficiency of kafs and community based bio sand filters commonly used for arsenic removal showed inadequate removal efficiency of arsenic as well as pathogens supplementary material table a 1 that can be detrimental when used for drinking purpose timalsina et al 2021 all these shortcomings the marginalized community the overall lack of sustainability in preexisting filters called for a new efficient natural adsorbent based and economic filter design with better removal efficiency for both states of arsenic laterite soil in both raw and treated form has been continuously used worldwide to adsorb the arsenic and lead contaminants as well as other heavy earth metals due to the presence of hydroxides of iron and aluminum as ferric iron can be used to co precipitate arsenic from water as ferric arsenate aredes et al 2013 and amorphous aluminum hydroxide has been known to adsorb maximum arsenate at ph range of 4 4 5 giles et al 2011 similarly the inadequate pathogen removal and lack of proper adsorption of heavy metal cations by kaf led us to evaluate the efficacy of activated carbon as a subsidiary adsorbent along with treated laterite studies have shown that activated carbon can efficiently remove harmful pathogens such as e coli from drinking water and reduce the chances of getting water borne diseases alameddine et al 2021 the availability of carboxyl carbonyl hydroxyl and lactonized carboxyl functional groups in activated carbon further helps in adsorption of heavy metal ions such as iron manganese bin jusoh et al 2005 and larger surface area porous structure and high adsorption capacity of activated surface allows easy adsorption of lead pb ii mercury hg ii and copper cu ii ions anirudhan and sreekumari 2011 numerous studies have elucidated that the health of people of terai region is at high risk due to arsenic contamination especially when they are dependent upon the existing filters believing that they yield safe drinking water this demands the more efficient filter at comparable cost as that of existing filters the lacking efficacy of extant filter systems to remove heavy metal cations restrict coliform growth and monitor the leachate and sulphate precipitates provides enough spaces for laterites system to be implemented the properties of fe and al ores and minerals to adsorb arsenic led us to evaluate the efficiency of using laterite soil as cost effective natural adsorbent for arsenic removal as laterite is locally available cheap and have huge adsorption affinity for arsenic the authors have studied its overall efficacy in removal of both states of arsenic more specifically this study demonstrates the suitability of laterite soil in adsorption of arsenic variation in adsorption property at different degree of treatment of ph physical state effect of particle size adsorbent dose and contact time using different isotherm models moreover the study of breakthrough time for adsorption column is done using logit model the effluent properties of the column are measured and alternative filter model for efficient arsenic removal is proposed along with suggesting potential modification of existing household and community based filters this study is focused mainly on the potential viability of using laterite bed in the existing kaf filter to effectively remove coliform and arsenic contaminant especially as iii species the use of activated carbon provides improved value of coliform control the laterite bed layer can further be acid activated to enhance overall arsenic adsorption efficacy and use of activated charcoal to enhance pathogens removal the absence of sulphate deposits as product of acid activation furthers assures the availability of active protonated surface of adsorbent in the filter system similarly the technical and socio economic feasibility of such system in terai community are studied with comparison to the locally available household filters currently in use in that specific region the authors also have shed light on potential of future research and applicability of laterite media on community based as well as industrial filter systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the laterite samples were collected from four different locations ramche sindhupalchowk 27 47 18 94 n 85 51 43 07 e panchkhal kavre 27 39 40 74 n 85 36 42 83 e chainpur chitwan 27 39 02 44 n 84 34 57 41 e and fasku dolakha 27 37 15 56 n 86 02 04 52 e all four samples were collected after screening off the plant roots debris and gravel pieces from the depth ranging in 1 3 m beneath the earth surface the samples so collected were dried crushed and finally screened through nylon sieve mesh 100 μm and 200 μm to collect laterite particles in between 0 1mm and 0 2 mm in size each sample from each particular location was labeled and stored in airtight vessels under non moisture conditions 2 2 contaminated groundwater samples groundwater samples contaminated by arsenic with contaminations in the range of 65 μg l 435 μg l were collected from various wells marked poisonous by health authorities in terai region of nepal the samples were taken from the wells having depth up to 40 m and stored in capped polyethylene bottles each of these samples were examined for total arsenic concentrations for both as iii and as v state of arsenic apart from these the hardness ph total dissolved solids lead concentration turbidity and other physio chemical properties of the groundwater samples were also analyzed 2 3 preparation of arsenic solutions for preparing standard 1000 μg l arsenite as iii solution 10 ppm of stock solution was first prepared by dissolving sodium arsenite naaso2 supreme chemicals bp in distilled pure water and later diluted to required concentration standard inorganic arsenic v stock solution 1000 μg l was prepared by dissolving disodium arsenate na2haso4 7h2o supreme chemicals bp in distilled water and after further dilution similarly stock solution for arsenic mixture was also brought to the lab for ph adjustments of the solutions hydrochloric acid hcl and sodium hydroxide naoh was used and all the chemicals used were of analytical grade 2 4 preparation of adsorbent for the acid activation of raw laterite rl 100 g of 0 1 0 2 mm particle size raw laterite and 200 ml of 4 n hcl were taken into a 1000 ml glass beaker and subjected to a temperature of 85 5 c with constant stirring for 2 4 h after removing the liquid from the distillation process a total of 400 ml of distilled water was added to the solid fraction after that 2 0 n naoh solution was added and stirred at room temperature to ensure the final ph of the step reached 6 5 to 7 5 the whole mass was further stirred for a couple of hours and left undisturbed for a day to decant off the clear liquid layer from the top the wet solid product was filtered on a whatman grade 512½ cellulose qualitative filter paper washed thoroughly by distilled water for several times oven dried first at 60 c for 3 h and then left to air dry to obtain dry solid acid activated laterite treated laterite tl which was used as an efficient arsenic adsorbent for contaminated groundwater the detailed study of calcium in water in form of hardening bicarbonate salts and general free form should be studied prior to the adsorption tests as calcium counteracts the oxyanion effects of competitive ion movement ahmad et al 2020a 2020b 2020c 2 5 scale up synthesis of tl for larger sets of experiments to be done and filter to be designed the raw laterite was produced into the activated form in large volume for this similar process as in ph activation was used but with greater volume of acid and adsorbent in use for bulk production 4 kg of raw laterite was mixed with 8000 ml of 2 n hcl and similar process was adopted the produced sample was stored and used as adsorbent in proposed filter system further study on the mass production of acid activated laterite stocks and their availability at the designated study application area should be implemented and the rate and mechanism of buffering of laterite sample via presence of calcium salts in water should be thoroughly studied 2 6 characterization of adsorbent sample collected and freed from unwanted impurities were taken from several viable locations and tested for physical and chemical composition the bulk density presence of metal cations and ph of zero net charge as per maiti et al 2007 on adsorbent surface were analyzed and values were tabulated for varying compositions of raw laterite soil collected from four different locations tests were repeated separately for each sample and reported in supplementary material table a 2 elemental analysis of inorganic constituents of raw laterite was done by atomic absorption spectrometer agilent aa5 200 series and automated titration system mettler dl40rc was adopted for hardness analysis of contaminated groundwater and effluent of filter system for determining organic carbon walkey black method modified for automatic titration was followed turoni model 50 200 multifunction digital ph meter was used to evaluate ph and conductivity of solutions throughout the experiment varian 600 atomic adsorption spectrometer with a graphite furnace was used for total arsenic determination and for arsenic species determination the elemental composition of the laterite sample has been tabulated in supplementary materials table a 2 the phzpc zero point charge ph of each laterite sample was found out by method as given by maji et al 2008 2 7 adsorption tests of arsenic on laterite soil 2 7 1 batch experiment batch experiments were conducted to study the change in arsenic removal efficacy of treated laterite with change in ph of the solution at a lab temperature of 25 c addition of 1 2 g of treated laterite was made to 100 ml of arsenic solution i e mixture of as iii and as v solutions of combined 1 ppm concentration in an airtight polyethylene bottles and allowed to be shaken by a mechanical shaker at about 300 400 rpm kept in a temperature controlled water bath experiments for finding optimal value of parameters such as adsorbent dose adsorbent particle size ph of solution detention time form of adsorbent for removal of arsenic combined mixture were carried out for this tests for adsorbent dose in range of 0 40 g l at ph value of 7 5 particle size determination 0 1mm 0 2 mm detention time check for 0 8hrs and ph value test by varying ph of solutions from 1 to 14 were conducted under normal lab temperature and pressure conditions the final products and solutions of all such tests were labeled and analyzed for calculating the final arsenic concentration in them 2 7 1 1 effect of particle size of adsorbents the first lab test was conducted to fix the most efficient adsorbent particle size before analyzing optimum dose and optimum detention time of the adsorbent test modules were operated for a 1000 μg l of lab prepared arsenic solution b collected groundwater sample with varying arsenic doses where 40 g l of adsorbent ranging in particle size from 0 1 mm to 0 2 mm was kept in an attached mechanical shaker operating at 200 rpm for 20 min to check the most efficient particle size the arsenic content before and after the batch test were studied and percentage removal percentage adsorption efficiency of as by the laterite sample was studied in each case 2 7 1 2 effect of contact time also for finding the most suitable detention time static batch tests were carried out for three different sample sizes of 0 16 mm 0 165 mm and 0 17 mm with ph maintained at 7 25 lab temperature of 25 c and adsorbent dose kept constant at 40 g l tests were conducted in all four laterite samples from different locations and repeated for three times in each of them and the average of three outputs were recorded as final data and the most efficient one sample from kavre was reported 2 7 1 3 effect of adsorbent dose after successful selection of 0 165 mm as the average adsorbent particle size six different modules were prepared to test for several adsorbent dose ranging from 5 g l to 40 g l for a total detention time of 1 8 h specifically for detention time of 2 h tests were carried out in six modules so prepared but for detention time of 4 h 3 different trials were made in each of six modules each for a different particle size and average value of them were reported 2 7 1 4 effect of ph with variation in adsorbent size batch experiments were conducted to study the change in arsenic removal efficacy of treated laterite with change in ph of the solution by using 40 g l dose of adsorbent initial arsenic dose of 1 ppm lab synthesized and contaminated groundwater of varying arsenic concentrations subjected to 200 rpm of shaking speed for 10 min under normal lab conditions initial treatment of the raw laterite sample to different ph was carried out by acid activation followed by subsequent washing till the normal ph was restored for respective use of each sample in the batch experiment the solution ph was further balanced and maintained by naoh and hcl solutions for each ph value from 1 to 14 the percentage of arsenic adsorbed by grinded treated laterite 0 165 mm and granular acid treated laterite of grain size 1 2 mm were studied in batch experiments 2 7 2 column experiment for column study treated laterite tl was packed in a minute tower and contacted with the arsenic contaminated lab samples and real groundwater samples collected from highly exposed areas the flow rate was well maintained and the effluent sample was collected at fixed intervals and further analyzed for the remnant of arsenic contaminant left in the solution after a round of adsorption by the column laterite 3 results and discussions characteristics of adsorbents obtained from different samples effects of removal of arsenic on varying operating parameters their adsorption kinetics adsorption equilibrium and adsorption isotherms are discussed in the following sections 3 1 adsorbent characterization the sample from kavre showed maximum arsenic adsorption supplementary material table a 2 in initial evaluation tests which may account to its higher ferric and aluminum hydroxides content maji et al 2008 and also to the harsh weathering condition of the site of collection causing loss of leachate ions and deposition of iron and aluminum compounds in the parent soil the removal of the as iii by fe al compounds is facilitated by sequences of surface adsorption oxidation and the intra particle reduction and the formation of inner and outer surface complexes cheng et al 2016 3 2 adsorptive removal of arsenic 3 2 1 effect of particle size of adsorbents from static batch test it was seen fig 1 a that for particle size of 0 16 0 17 mm the adsorption rate of arsenic was higher the adsorption curve increased gradually with increasing mean particle size of the adsorbent from 0 11 mm 0 17 mm and then with further increment in size the fall in curve was prominent this shows that for sample of 0 1 0 2 mm particle size higher adsorption can be achieved with sizes between 0 16 and 0 17 mm this stated the tendency of the adsorbent to filter off the arsenic contaminant in an increasing fashion up to an optimum particle size the greater value for the sample size after that stage will lead to the loss of surface area and lack of abundant activated sites at the adsorbent surface maji et al 2007 lingamdinne et al 2020 3 2 2 effect of detention time sharp change in curve fig 1b was observed in between detention time of 2 4 h percentage removal of arsenic by adsorbent via adsorption process increased from low value of 25 1 at 1 h detention period to 33 3 at 2 h and then a sharp increment to 88 7 at 4 h detention time after 4 h of detention time the curves flattened to show slow yet gradual increment in removal percentage though higher percentage removal was observed in time period beyond 7 8 h removal percentage reaching 96 98 5 for time efficient filter design 4 h of detention time was chosen as best fit for further tests for a detention time of 4 h adsorbent of particle size 0 165 mm was chosen for the arsenic adsorption for which maximum adsorption was found to be around 98 5 at higher detention time with an increase in detention time the rate remains constant and increase in a very low scale due to the saturation of adsorption sites maji et al 2008 prabhakar et al 2021 3 2 3 effect of adsorbent dose for the adsorbent dose of 40 g l and at a detention time of 4 h about 98 125 fig 1c of arsenic adsorption was seen in the sample when shaker speed was 300 rpm and shaking time fixed at 20 min with increase in adsorbent dose the total number of active sites for adsorption was increased and thus the removal efficiency of adsorbent went on increasing this is due to the availability of free sites for metal cations to get attracted to and the process is further facilitated by the higher adsorption capacity of respective adsorbent media sanou et al 2020a 2020b 3 2 4 effect of ph on arsenic adsorption and effect of physical form of adsorbent the maximum arsenic adsorption of 97 5 fig 1d was shown by sample size 0 165 mm at ph of 4 which gradually went on increasing as the solution became alkaline however after reaching a low value at ph value 12 the rate jumpstart increasing again since with increasing alkalinity of the solution the regeneration of laterite was prominent the value of arsenic removal percentage may have started to increase slightly after ph value 12 in grinded form the adsorption of as iii went on increasing from ph value 1 onwards till a maximum adsorption of 99 84 fig 1e was seen at ph of 8 a slow gradual decline up to 52 3 was seen then till the ph of solution reached 11 with further increase in alkalinity the arsenic removal rate started to increase due to adsorbent regeneration and thus at ph of 14 the percentage removal of arsenic was found to be 63 4 for as v grinded tl showed maximum efficacy 99 66 at ph value 3 followed by a gradual decrement till the ph of solution was 8 an early increase in adsorption rate was seen after the ph crossed that value possibly due to adsorbent regeneration and increase in active reaction sites the value increased from low 40 38 at ph value of 8 63 33 at ph 14 of solution in batch experiments however in granular tl as iii and as v attained maximum adsorption on adsorbent at ph value of 8 and 3 respectively with relatively lower overall efficiency of 82 52 and 84 6 at respective ph after the solution went alkaline the adsorption of as iii and as v were seen minimum at ph 12 38 81 and ph 9 27 4 for granular laterite the effect of change in ph on the rate of adsorption of arsenic by acid activated laterite tl can be described by various mechanism like surface protonation nagar et al 2010 ligand exchange partey et al 2009 chemical interaction ion exchange electrostatic attraction repulsion the ph for zero net charge on laterite soil was determined by potentiometric titrations thereby reporting a value of phzpc as 6 39 below that ph the soil surface is positively charged by surface protonation favored under acidic conditions and when ph crosses phzpc value the soil surface gains negative charge under alkaline condition lim et al 2021 the efficacy of adsorption is then affected by the charge nature at soil surface interface and the type of arsenic species abundant at that ph range better illustrated by following governing reactions fig 2 at soil interface when the ph of the solution is well below phzpc point of zero charge h2aso4 has the highest concentration in the soil ph 2 and since the soil has gained positive surface charges due to acidity of the medium h2aso4 binds with the surface cations of the soil zhu et al 2021 the feasibility of this process of attraction of opposite charges is high as h2aso4 requires less energy for binding and ph of solution is less than 6 7 but when ph starts to increase the rate shows gradual declination suggesting that less cations are being released to the soil surface interface relative to the greater concentration of monocharged arsenic species lim et al 2021 thanh nguyen et al 2020 the rate declines and reaches it lowest at ph value of 11 5 as the ph of solution starts increasing and ph phzpc 0 the soil surface starts accumulating negative charges saadon et al 2018 in addition to this free release of competitive hydroxyl ions oh is prominent in the solution the dominant arsenic species at ph phzpc 6 39 is haso4 2 which now has to compete with hydroxyl ions for relatively less positive binding sites in soil surface bhattacharjee et al 2021 and the higher binding energy requirement of haso4 2 species of arsenic maqsood et al 2021 for arsenate as v the maximum adsorption was seen at ph value of 3 for both grinded and granular state of acid activated laterite samples the removal efficiency of treated laterite showed an increment from ph value 1 to ph value 3 as we neared the stable ph range of 3 4 for haso4 species at ph value 3 the graph showed the maximum removal of arsenate as 99 66 and 84 6 for grinded and granular form respectively as the ph of solution batch just crossed phzpc of 6 39 soil sample from kavre that means nearing the neutral ph value the concentration of h2aso4 and haso42 was nearly equal in the solution thereby making electrostatic attraction mechanism no longer feasible dissanayake et al 2021 as chemical reaction mechanism for neutral species began formulating the arsenate removal adsorption rate decreased to its minimum value of 40 38 at ph 8 and 27 4 at ph 9 for grinded treated laterite and granular treated laterite respectively as 1 n naoh solution was being used to maintain ph of the solution the used adsorbent loaded with monoarsenious adsorbate underwent regeneration bandara et al 2020 and thus increased number of fresh active positive sites for attracting diarsenious species at higher ph maiti et al 2007 the chemical sorption of specific anions at alkaline condition and the ion attraction process which just got induced led to slow but gradual increase in adsorption of as v on regenerated laterite beyond ph of 8 in case of adsorption of as iii species on treated laterite it follows inner sphere sorption behavior above phzpc value and below it outer sphere mechanism is inherited partey 2008 inner sphere complexes are formed when monodentate ligand exchange mechanism takes place between hydroxyl ion on laterite soil surface and arsenite species maiti et al 2007 aredes et al 2013 which can be described in equation as 1 moh s h3aso3 aq mh2aso3 h2o where m abundant metal cation for laterite soil fe and al h3aso3 denotes neutral arsenite species at ph beyond 8 similar interactions of arsenic species on soil surface interface are enumerated as 2 2 moh s h3aso3 aq mhaso3m 2h2o 3 moh s h2aso4 aq mh2aso4 oh 4 moh s 2 h2aso4 aq mh2aso4 h2o the maximum adsorption efficiency of treated laterite for as iii species was observed at ph 8 as 99 84 82 52 fig 1c for grinded and granular form of treated adsorbent material respectively the curve then suffers a slow decline up to ph of 11 and 12 for grinded and granular treated laterite respectively this fluctuation in granular form can be attributed to the lesser surface area for reaction and low rate of attraction for species of favorable ph range due to inactivated surface cations after which due to adsorbent regeneration by naoh addition the removal rate for arsenite species started to show minute rise lim et al 2021 the added naoh for regeneration not only increased the ph value of solution favoring distribution of alkaline suitable arsenic species but also helped in replenishing used adsorbent by ligand displacement reaction of hydroxyl ions with arsenic species thereby increasing the number of active sites for reaction jang et al 2005 3 3 adorption isotherms experiments were conducted in batch at normal lab temperature of 25 c ph value of 6 5 7 5 shaking done at 240 300 rpm with dose of treated laterite in range of 5 40 g l and contaminant as mixture in initial concentration of 1000 μg l the determination of maximum adsorption capacity of adsorbent was done by plotting langmuir and freundlich isotherm from the test data fig 3 a and fig 3 b for a adsorbent adsorbate solution the langmuir isotherm can be illustrated linearly as 5 1 q e 1 qbc e 1 q where qe refers to the solute adsorbed at equilibrium in mg g 1 and ce denotes equilibrium solute concentration mg dm 3 in solution sarkar et al 2006 from the plotted graph fig 3a the linear plot equation was derived as y 0 2197x 5 7566 with regression r2 value of 0 9912 where y 1 q e x 1 c e with further calculations from received values of slope m and y intercept c of linearized langmuir isotherm maximum adsorption capacity of treated laterite qmax was calculated as 0 173 mg g and langmuir adsorption constant for adsorption energy b was found to be 26 310 l mg to determine the overall feasibility and spontaneity of reaction a constant term called rl and standard gibbs free energy change are correspondingly analyzed as maji et al 2008 6 r l 1 1 bc 0 where c0 denotes initial concentration of arsenic ppm and b refers to value of langmuir isotherm constant and from calculation isotherm shape can be defined as if value of rl 1 the isotherm is linear rl 1 the adsorption process is favorable rl 1 the adsorption process is unfavorable and for rl 0 the reaction process is irreversible the value of rl for treated laterite in our experiment was calculated to be 0 3661 that refers to the process being favorable with values of b derived from langmuir isotherm plot the standard gibbs free energy change δ g is calculated to check for the spontaneity of the overall adsorption process of arsenic species on treated laterite batch samples the equation regarding free energy change is given as 7 ln 1 b δ g rt where r the universal gas constant with value of 8 3145 j mol 1 k 1 b refers to langmuir isotherm constant and t is the absolute temperature of lab experiments 298 k in our case the then calculated value for δg was 8 1020 kj mol 1 the negative value denoting the spontaneous nature of adsorption process maji et al 2008 the freundlich model of isotherm analysis is shown by the equation 8 ln q e lnk f 1 n lnc e where constants kf denotes adsorption capacity and n denotes adsorption intensity the linear plot between lnqe and lnce fig 3b provides a linear line equation as y 0 5547x 0 7633 where x lnce and y lnqe with slope 0 5547 and intercept of 0 7633 and r2 of 0 9463 a value of n as 1 8027 l mg gives the adsorption intensity and value of kf as 0 4661 provides an insight on capacity of adsorption of arsenic species on treated laterite comparing the regression values for both langmuir and freundlich isotherms r2 langmuir 0 9912 r2 freundlich 0 9463 it was seen that the adsorption process best fits the langmuir isotherm plot langmuir isotherm model assumes that the adsorbent surface is homogenous and the favorable binding sites are distributed uniformly with same affinity for the ions similarly the process of adsorption will take place until a monolayer absorbate layer in developed at the surface aredes et al 2013 and is limited by the adsorbent s capacity and availability of sites boglione et al 2019 based on our experiments and the fitting of data with the langmuir isotherm the arsenic adsorption process is suggested to follow monolayer adsorption through homogenously activated surface of laterite soil boglione et al 2019 3 4 kinetics study for adsorption the kinetics and mechanism behind the as adsorption on laterite surface was analyzed by plotting first order reaction model based upon the concentration of solution lagergren pseudo first order reaction model on solid capacity second order reaction model based on metal ion adsorption and pseudo second order sorption reaction model of ho and mckay first order reaction model based upon the solution concentration first order reaction model can be illustrated as nazari et al 2021 9 lnc t lnc 0 k 1 t to obtain the regression coefficient a linear plot was made for lnct and time t fig 3c which showed a poor regression value of 0 8275 indicating the adsorption did not follow the first order reaction model that well pseudo first order reaction model the pseudo first order kinetic model based on the solid capacity for sorption analysis is of the form wong et al 2004 10 dq t dt ks 1 q 1 q t integrating above equation with the boundary condition t 0 to t t and qt 0 to qt qt gives the linearized form as shown by following equation 11 ln q 1 q t ln q 1 ks 1 t a linear plot made for ln q1 qt versus t fig 3d featured a correlation coefficient r2 0 9478 which further shows that the adsorption did not follow the pseudo first order reaction model 3 4 1 second order reaction model based upon adsorption of metal ions the second order rate equation can be represented in equation as ho 2006 12 dc t dt k 2 c t 2 rearranging the above equation followed by integration over the boundary condition of t 0 to t t and ct 0 to ct ct provides 13 1 c t 1 c 0 k 2 t hence the linear plot of 1 ct versus time t fig 3e produces a correlation coefficient of r2 0 9581 which is greater than pseudo first order model value but still not sufficient enough 3 4 2 pseudo second order model the data can finally be fitted to the pseudo second order model stated as ho and mckay 1999 14 dq t dt k q e q t 2 after integrating to the boundary condition of t 0 to t and qt 0 to qt and rearranging the terms we get 15 t q t 1 h t q e a linear plot of t qt against t fig 3f produces a regression value r2 0 9737 better than previous models which states ho and mckay s model as the best fit kinetic reaction model for arsenic adsorption on treated laterite soil surface 3 5 adsorption column and breakthrough study the column study for adsorption on fixed bed of treated laterite was done by introducing real contaminated groundwater sample collected from severely affected district of terai zone of nepal a minute circular tower of 0 35 cm diameter 400 mm height flow rate of 210 cm h and initial concentration of as of 200 μg l was modeled and plot for c co vs time t was made to find breakthrough time and exhaust time at c co of 0 3 and c co of 0 85 breakthrough time was found to be 0 76 h and exhaust time was calculated to be 2 h from fig 4 b logit method of column design was inherited to analyze the value of adsorption rate constant k and adsorption capacity coefficient n the logit equation can be expressed in the form of dhoble et al 2017 16 ln c c o 1 c c o k n x v k c o t where co initial dose of arsenic in groundwater sample 200 μg l c concentration at any time v approach velocity 0 035 m min x bed depth 200 mm k adsorption rate constant l mg hour and n adsorption capacity coefficient mg l rearranging above equation as 17 ln c c o c k n x v k c o t the linear plot of l n c c 0 c versus time fig 4a provides a straight line of slope equation y 0 307x 4 2467 r2 0 9739 where slope is given by kco and intercept as k n x v from where values of constant k and n can be found out for column study the adsorption rate constant k was found out from the logit model as 1 535 l mg hour and adsorption capacity coefficient n as 29 04 mg l the tabulated quantitative values for adsorption column study is shown in supplementary material table a 3 the higher coefficient of adsorption for treated laterite tl in column studies showed that it possessed better adsorption potential than other adsorbents such as clay minerals and kaolinites khan and imteaz 2021 geolites huo et al 2021 and ferric oxides alka et al 2021a 2021b red soil pigna et al 2020 and biomass altowayti et al 2021 therefore compared to the most applicable natural absorbent systems tl shows better performance and greater potential to be incorporated in practical filter models 3 6 post water effluent quality a check was made for the initial and final water quality parameters after a successful filtration cycle from prepared fixed bed adsorption column no leaching of iron or other trace elements onto the effluent water was seen and the ph of the output water was found to be in range of 6 7 7 2 arsenic and lead concentrations were within the safety limit thereby satisfying who permissible guidance and showing less fluctuation from initial value of collected groundwater samples the hard water laced with bicarbonate salts can alter the process of the treatment for acid activate laterite one of the alternatives is to treat the raw laterite to the desired ph level and perform a heat treatment on it another approach would be to treat the raw laterite with acid solution and then wash it multiple times with alkaline solution with an aim of surface activation and cleansing the pore sizes on the surface of the adsorbent will be activated and the protonation degree will be increased thereby drawing more arsenic cations towards it this will further eradicate the problem of bicarbonate salt buffering the acidified adsorbent the best remedy would be to activate the surface of the so used adsorbent and drop it to its original near neutral ph level and then conduct the experiments the development of oxyanions in the solution can reduce the rate of formation of ferric precipitates from the adsorption process while looking to design suitable water filter or treatment plants the availability of calcium salts in the water sample groundwater influent must be studied properly ahmad et al 2020a 2020b 2020c the rate of removal or separation of fe iii precipitates from water can be heavily influenced by the presence and concentration of calcium in the water source calcium in simpler forms or even as salts can enhance the rate of ferric precipitates and the buffering of treated adsorbent may commence ahmad et al 2020a 2020b 2020c the precipitated products can be properly separated but the rate at which the available calcium reduces the oxyanion effects on adsorption and enhance fe iii precipitate growth must be studied prior to the preparation of new filter system ahmad et al 2020a 2020b 2020c maiti et al 2007 as per recent studies the adsorption of arsenite is comparatively less efficient than that of arsenate in normal groundwater condition of near neutral ph of 6 5 7 this is due to the fact that arsenate as v is negatively charged and arsenite as iii is neutral ahmad et al 2020a 2020b 2020c the availability of competitive oxyanions in the groundwater and the presence of reactive humic acids declines the rate of arsenic adsorption to the fe iii precipitates via competitive adsorption on surface of adsorbent ahmad et al 2020a 2020b 2020c 3 7 applicability of laterite soil for adsorption of heavy metal ions the viable uses of laterite as an efficient natural adsorbent for removal of heavy metal ions from aqueous solutions have been studied in several researches and the findings are summarized in supplementary material table a 4 the table showed that treated laterite soil has high adsorption efficiency for heavy metals such as mercury strontium chromium lead and fluoride among the listed metals lead removal was relatively high at around 74 and studied in previous reputed research chatterjee et al 2018 the adsorption column was also studied for its efficacy in removal of lead and respective comparison with previous study was made the granular laterite showed huge potential in removing lead pb ii from contaminated groundwater for the short pilot batch adsorption study however more works regarding its adsorption and favoring mechanisms are essential 3 8 comparison of treated laterite soil with other natural and modified natural adsorbents the arsenic removal efficiency of acid activated laterite was compared with other suitable natural and modified natural adsorbents and their respective removal efficacy optimum ph of operation and maximum arsenic adsorption capacity were accessed and presented in supplementary material table a 5 as compared to previous similar laterite based studies tl had better values for maximum adsorption capacity similarly table a 5 shows that for modified adsorbents such as red mud and activated alumina the actual removal percentage was low it was reported as 37 3 and 96 2 respectively for red mud and activated alumina although both featured a better adsorption capacity initially furthermore the initial adsorbent dose required for the arsenic removal was also low for tl as compared to the other natural adsorbent and modified adsorbent the contact time of study and the ph range of study were both higher for laterite soil as compared to other adsorbents indexed in table a 5 apart for the usual arsenic adsorption affinity treated laterite also showed enhanced adsorption rates for other heavy metal cations as showed in supplementary table a 4 3 9 regeneration of adsorption media the bed layer of acid activated laterite used in filter operation was treated with 600 ml of 1 n naoh solution at 0 615 l h rate of flow the regenerated laterite sample was washed with distilled water for about 5 7 times until the ph value reached 6 2 6 5 and then left for 10 15 h and adsorption test was carried out to check the discrepancy in efficiency of laterite after passing the arsenic loaded groundwater samples of contamination level of 300 450 μg l through the regenerated filter bed layer of treated laterite a change in adsorption efficiency by 0 2 0 4 was seen for eight different checks this showed that the used adsorbent can efficiently maintain its adsorption capacity post the alkali treatment although the removal efficiency increased initially due to the alkali treatment and creation of more favorable reaction sites jang et al 2005 the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent slowly declines with each cycle of regeneration as shown in previous experiments maiti et al 2007 a relative loss of 2 3 in the arsenic adsorption capacity of laterite was prominent after the first cycle of regeneration treatment by naoh causes the increase in active sites for reaction sanou et al 2020a 2020b and increase in pore size of adsorbent media thereby facilitating overall adsorption maji et al 2008 however the economic consistency for terai households should be considered for long term run of filter 3 10 proposal of design of household arsenic filter based on results of column test we propose an alternative laterite based household filter fig 5 a for efficient arsenic pathogens as well as heavy metals removal the proposed filter system would consist of 97 cm tall chamber 1 m including base thickness and 35 cm internal diameter with following constituents from top to bottom a freeboard of 12 cm for raw water 5 cm bed layer of brick chips for effective diffusion of water grinded acid activated laterite particle size 0 165 mm of 20 cm depth 30 cm fine sand bed particle size 1 mm activated charcoal of bed depth 10 cm coarse sand 1 2 mm of depth 10 cm and gravel base varying size in range of 2 8 mm of depth 20 cm followed by a polyester cloth for providing clean water to the outlet tap for construction of filter properly washed gravel bed is prepared and placed in a plastic or concrete case followed by a layer of coarse sand and activated charcoal fine sand can be obtained by sieving with sieve size 1 mm before integrating laterite soil as a layer in the filter laterite soil about 4 kg should be freed from deleterious particles grinded and washed thoroughly with potable water more efficiency can be obtained by using treated laterite acid activated at ph of 4 and well washed before use maintenance of the filter should be done properly to ensure the well functioning and effluent to be within allowable limit it includes both the regular periodic maintenance tasks as well as emergency maintenance during breakdown of the filter the adsorbent media laterite soil activated charcoal and sand should be cleaned on periodic basis based on monitoring to ensure availability of surface for adsorption of arsenic as well as removal of pathogens the mass scaling of activated laterite can be done by a local level project with a fund deposit from national governing bodies the easy transport and storage of produced laterite stock can be managed at a local warehouse or a central storage from where it can be easily distributed to the place of demand however all such analysis has not been made in this paper as the technical analysis of product and its distribution has not been thoroughly studied if feasible the filter media should be replaced annually or based on pilot tests to ascertain adsorption capacity moreover pilot tests are imperative for adjustment in the dimensions proposed and to determine the actual efficiency as well as filtration capacity of filters the filter system is a proposed one and field tests were not conducted the efficacy of such system has been proposed through detailed analysis of the removal potential of adsorbent media used and coliform controlling bed layer incorporated into the system 3 11 potential enhancement of existing filters potential enhancement on arsenic removal efficiency can also be obtained by modification of the most commonly used existing filters for household community as well as industrial use 3 11 1 modification on kanchan arsenic filter enhancement on kaf can be made by integrating a layer of laterite above the sand layer below diffusion chamber containing iron nails which improves arsenic and other heavy metals such as manganese cadmium lead antimony mercury nickel and copper removal capacity moreover integrating a bed of charcoal 10 cm in between fine sand and coarse sand layers enhances pathogen removal and adsorption of iron and manganese ions from the water sample thus allowing the effluent within the desired standards overall dimensions of layers of the filter are demonstrated in fig 5b 3 11 2 modification of industrial and community based bio sand filter another potential use of treated laterite bed could be in the typical community based bio sand filters timalsina et al 2021 where arsenic removal efficiency is low and requires remedies in those communities where water supply is based on single source improvement of community based filter can play life saver role of hundreds of people of that community community based model of slow bio sand filter with separate compartments for treatment and storage consists of initial influent tower packed with gravels of varying sizes 8 mm 4 mm and 2 mm with washout valves for cleansing impurities the water then enters the sand bed tower where treated laterite 0 165 mm and activated charcoal between two filter sand beds fig 5c the effluent is piped through pores of coarse bed aggregate into the treated water chamber and tapped out for drinking purposes 3 12 comparative study existing and proposed filters the comparative study between the existing filter systems and proposed filter has been made in terms of technical as well as socio economic feasibility the extant and most efficient filter in terai region of nepal has been kanchan arsenic filter kaf which was incorporated after modifications and upgrades in 2 kolshi and 3 kolshi filter systems were made ogata et al 2020 ngai et al 2006 studies have shown lacking efficacy of all three filters in removal of coliform and arsenite the coagulants and oxidants aided 2 kolshi filter flaunted a maximum arsenic removal efficiency of 95 which was relatively lower than 3 kolshi s value at 99 supplementary material table a 1 in terms of iron removal 2 kolshi was better with 99 success rate while 3 kolshi had a satisfactory value around 90 the lacking pathogen removal efficacy was a major problem in previous filters as 2 kolshi showed 93 of removal rate while kaf featured a poor performance with just 60 of removal efficiency ngai et al 2007 the proposed modified filter utilizes the additional laterite adsorbent bed to filter off arsenite from the influent and also make use of the activated carbon layer to check coliform colony growth the cost breakdown of the proposed filter system for installation is shown in supplementary materials table a 6 the operation and maintenance cost are for both scheduled tasks and the emergency breakdown responses scheduled tasks include cleaning replacing iron nails and washing sand gravels and laterite the sand should be washed every 6 12 months to maintain the sorption capacity while iron nails can last for about 3 years timalsina et al 2021 ngai et al 2006 local vendors have been supplying constructing the kaf 2 kolshi and 3 kolshi filters the treatment rate high usage rate easiness of construction distribution as well as simplicity in operation and maintenance has been studied from past studies as well as verified at the field conditions supplementary material table a 7 the initial cost for construction of the proposed filter is higher than the existing kaf by nominal amount 5 to 10 it includes the cost for addition of charcoal and laterite bed layer however the proposed system would require less maintenance cost as the laterite bed layer acts as additional sorption layer requiring less frequent cleaning of the sand and gravel bed layers on the other hand 2 kolshi and 3 kolshi filters are cheaper for installation in the beginning but have higher operation cost due to need of coagulants as well as frequent clogging thus the use of laterite as an additional adsorbent layer in the existing system would lead to greater efficiency and less o m cost with nominal increase in the installation cost 4 conclusion the use of acid activated laterite as adsorbent was found to be economic and efficient in removal of both as iii and as v species of arsenic from the contaminated groundwater batch study showed that the most efficient optimum particle size for treated laterite is 0 165 mm adsorbent dose is 40 g l and detention time is 4 h the study revealed that at ph value of 3 the adsorption efficiency of arsenate as v was maximum at 99 66 and for arsenite as iii maximum adsorption on laterite was 98 84 seen at ph 8 from isotherm studies it was enumerated that the adsorption process was best fit by langmuir plot with regression value r2 of 0 9912 and maximum adsorption capacity of 0 173 mg g the rl value of 0 3661 enlightens that the reaction process is favorable and δ go value of 8 1020 kj mol 1 depicts the spontaneous nature of adsorption process it was observed that the adsorption mechanism followed pseudo second order reaction kinetics with r2 value of 0 9737 the logit model design of column of height 40 mm and diameter 0 35 cm had an adsorption rate constant of 1 535 l mg hour and adsorption capacity coefficient n of 29 04 mg l the tests of effluents passed from fixed bed adsorption column showed that no leaching of iron or other trace elements like cu and al into the effluent of filter was present since laterite also possessed high adsorption capacity for other heavy metals such as ni cd mn pb co and activated charcoal had higher efficiency of removal of harmful pathogens and iron ions from groundwater influent the use of acid activated laterite as filter media incorporated with activated charcoal bed was found favorable and more efficient thus laterite can be a better adsorbent for arsenic removal its application in the arsenic filter can enhance the efficiency of arsenic filters thus detailed studies are essential to verify the enhancement

11798,groundwater arsenic contamination has been a global threat due to its pernicious health impacts on people many studies have revealed the status of severe arsenic contamination and its health hazards in many districts in terai region of nepal of the many technologies available for arsenic treatment very few are suitable for rural terai region and the most widely used kanchan arsenic filters kaf have shown inefficient performance by recent studies depicting the need for enhancement of existing filters or finding better alternatives this study suggests a better method of arsenic treatment using laterite soil as an efficient adsorbent batch study done with adsorbent treated laterite dose kept in between 0 40 g l at lab temperature 25 2 c showed the most efficient optimum particle size for treated laterite as 0 165 mm adsorbent dose 40 g l and detention time 4 h with initial arsenic concentration of 1000 μg l the maximum removal of as iii 98 84 and as v 99 66 was observed near ph value of 8 and 3 respectively the overall reaction was observed to follow pseudo second order kinetics and langmuir isotherm curve was best fit for the process data with the highest regression coefficient r2 0 99 fixed bed column study was also conducted to access the quality and applicability of laterite soil as filter media for a newly proposed system the modification viability of existing filter by adding beds of activated carbon and acid activated laterite for enhancing performance are discussed as well as its application in a new filter system is proposed graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater treated laterite adsorbent arsenic removal efficient filter activated charcoal 1 introduction arsenic is a deleterious contaminant that occurs in groundwater aquifers through natural as well as artificial processes and has already impacted on lives of millions of people worldwide rahaman et al 2021 basically there are four oxidation states of arsenic in nature prevalent as arsine as iii arsenic as 0 arsenite as iii and arsenate as v the abundance of one species over another depends upon the oxidizing or reducing nature of existing environment commonly arsenate as v is facilitated in aerobic environment in forms of h2aso4 and haso42 and arsenite as iii in anoxic environments as h3aso3 and h2aso3 reid et al 2020 currently 94 to 200 million people are estimated to be at high risk of groundwater arsenic contamination of which major population lies in asia podgorski and berg 2020 herath et al 2016 with nepal being one of the countries reported for having high degree of arsenic as contamination shrestha et al 2003 timalsina et al 2021 our study focuses on the available arsenic removal technologies their performance and enhancement in removal efficiency in the arsenic filters widely used in nepal see tables 1 3 the who guideline suggests the safe as limit value in drinking water to be 10 ppb however a higher value of 50 ppb has been standardized in developing countries with higher concentration of arsenic contamination due to constraints associated with their removal the general concentration of as in groundwater lies in the range of 1 10 μg l but reports from 70 countries shows contamination exceeding 1000 μg l singh et al 2015 kumar and singh 2020 a collaboration between nasc and environment public health organization enpho which tested 18 635 tube wells 20 terai district illustrated that nawalparasi rupandehi bara and rautahat are the major districts having high fatal doses of arsenic and exceeding the nepal drinking water quality standards ndwqs guidelines yadav et al 2012 arsenic concentration up to 2620 μg l has been reported in groundwater of terai region of nepal the status of groundwater arsenic contamination in nepal supplementary material fig a 1 demonstrates most of the districts of terai region of nepal have arsenic concentration above the permissible limit since the majority of population of nepal reside in terai region and most of them are directly dependent upon highly contaminated groundwater for agricultural as well as domestic purposes a serious threat is posed upon the health of people timalsina et al 2021 therefore it is not just a duty but priority to treat the arsenic contaminated groundwater supply and bring it within the safe limit the groundwater arsenic carves many origin with both natural and artificial sources such as industrial landfills pesticides fuel burns holocene aquifers bhattacharya et al 2004 reducing aquifers bhattacharya et al 2003 mining leachate microbial oxidation weathering bundschuh et al 2010 and pyrite dissolution ali et al 2019 podgorski and berg 2020 ahmad et al 2020a 2020b 2020c the arsenic contamination has been attributed as an eroded product of perennial rivers that scour the crystalline peraluminous leucogranites derived from the metasedimentary crustal protoliths at higher himalayas and transmit it along with other trace elements to the gangetic plains mueller 2018 where low scale effects of lesser as dose involves pain in abdomen nausea and vomiting diarrhea loss of appetite and hairfall the exposure to higher doses on a long term basis leads to slow but gradual leukomelanosite failure of organs arsenicosis bhattacharya et al 2007 skin pigmentation peripheral neuropathy sister chromatid exchange hyperkeratosis and encephalopathy bhowmick et al 2018 annaduzzaman et al 2018 and cancer after series of hypo hyper methylation on dna mohora et al 2018 ahmad et al 2020a 2020b 2020c similarly organic species is more toxic than inorganic species of arsenic and arsenite has been reported to be 60 times more toxic than arsenate ayub h 2020 therefore there is utmost necessity of removing arsenic from groundwater before use many techniques of treating arsenic from contaminated groundwater includes membrane technology alka et al 2021a 2021b nanoparticles raval and kumar 2021 coagulation and flocculation moreira et al 2021 co precipitation razzak et al 2021 ahmad et al 2020a 2020b 2020c adsorption dhanasekaran and sahu 2021 ultra filtration yaqub and lee 2020 reverse osmosis chen et al 2020 ion exchange rathi et al 2021 ozone oxidation liu and qu 2021 bioremediation hubadillah et al 2020 and electrochemical treatment syam babu and nidheesh 2021 after analyzing the technical shortcomings removal efficiency economic considerations local availability etc of all the available treatment processes adsorption is seen as the most economic and efficient process to remove arsenic alka et al 2021a 2021b moreover aluminum and iron based sorption are considered as the excellent and the most widely accepted and followed adsorption techniques used in household as well as commercially timalsina et al 2021 the arsenic filters are constructed with further modifications to meet the demands quality standards of drinking water the arsenic filter should be economical efficient easily constructed with locally available materials socially accepted convenient for operation and maintenance especially in terai region of nepal it should have a rural focus and very straightforward to use timalsina et al 2021 among the several arsenic filters proposed by different organizations jerry can system 2 kolshi filter 3 kolshi filter and kanchan arsenic filter kaf are the most popular ones and reasonably suitable the review of pilot studies by timalsina et al 2021 showed kaf stands at the top in terms of efficiency of pathogens iron and arsenic removal cost of construction and maintenance omitting use of chemicals coagulants and thus is the most commonly used arsenic filter in nepal kaf is a modified bio sand filter designed to remove arsenic and pathogens simultaneously it consists of gravel sand and innovative diffuser basin containing iron nails brick chips and raw water from bottom to top cased inside plastic or cement concrete container ngai et al 2006 2007 in the kaf non galvanized iron nails are exposed to air and water rusting quickly and producing ferric hydroxide on the iron nails surface when arsenic containing water is poured into the filter arsenic is rapidly adsorbed onto the surface of the ferric hydroxide brick chips are used for uniform diffusion of raw water so as to prevent dislocation of iron nails the iron particles loaded with as is then trapped in the small pores of sand layer below by physical straining phenomena moreover pathogens also get trapped in the sand layer and consequently get removed from the water ngai et al 2006 2007 technical evaluation by ngai et al 2007 demonstrated the removal rate of 85 90 arsenic 90 95 iron 80 95 turbidity and 85 99 of total coliforms at the design and installation phase however an independent study regarding assessment of performance of kafs deployed in 62 households reported that only 54 of kafs reduced the high arsenic level to safe limit singh et al 2014 according to which gem 505 model of filter was seen to reduce groundwater influent with as contaminant as high as 400 μg l of total arsenic 80 20 ratio of as iii as v to 50 μg l of total arsenic thus showing only 85 90 removal rate singh et al 2014 the study by ogata et al 2020 also depicts inadequacy of performance of kaf as the removal of as was only 75 and 38 of the samples could not meet safety standards moreover kafs were observed to have a lower fe dose relatively shorter retention time higher concentration of trace elements and dissolved solids in effluent dry nail bed layer poor maintenance and higher operation ph which further lowered its overall efficacy mueller et al 2020 further the x ray inspections of prearranged nails from some kanchan filters showed the formation of siderite on the surface at higher temperature which stated the fact that at terai region in hot and humid climate exceeding 40 c in summer the so formed siderite will cover the nail surface in diffusion basin sealing it off for further as adsorption also the review on efficiency of kafs and community based bio sand filters commonly used for arsenic removal showed inadequate removal efficiency of arsenic as well as pathogens supplementary material table a 1 that can be detrimental when used for drinking purpose timalsina et al 2021 all these shortcomings the marginalized community the overall lack of sustainability in preexisting filters called for a new efficient natural adsorbent based and economic filter design with better removal efficiency for both states of arsenic laterite soil in both raw and treated form has been continuously used worldwide to adsorb the arsenic and lead contaminants as well as other heavy earth metals due to the presence of hydroxides of iron and aluminum as ferric iron can be used to co precipitate arsenic from water as ferric arsenate aredes et al 2013 and amorphous aluminum hydroxide has been known to adsorb maximum arsenate at ph range of 4 4 5 giles et al 2011 similarly the inadequate pathogen removal and lack of proper adsorption of heavy metal cations by kaf led us to evaluate the efficacy of activated carbon as a subsidiary adsorbent along with treated laterite studies have shown that activated carbon can efficiently remove harmful pathogens such as e coli from drinking water and reduce the chances of getting water borne diseases alameddine et al 2021 the availability of carboxyl carbonyl hydroxyl and lactonized carboxyl functional groups in activated carbon further helps in adsorption of heavy metal ions such as iron manganese bin jusoh et al 2005 and larger surface area porous structure and high adsorption capacity of activated surface allows easy adsorption of lead pb ii mercury hg ii and copper cu ii ions anirudhan and sreekumari 2011 numerous studies have elucidated that the health of people of terai region is at high risk due to arsenic contamination especially when they are dependent upon the existing filters believing that they yield safe drinking water this demands the more efficient filter at comparable cost as that of existing filters the lacking efficacy of extant filter systems to remove heavy metal cations restrict coliform growth and monitor the leachate and sulphate precipitates provides enough spaces for laterites system to be implemented the properties of fe and al ores and minerals to adsorb arsenic led us to evaluate the efficiency of using laterite soil as cost effective natural adsorbent for arsenic removal as laterite is locally available cheap and have huge adsorption affinity for arsenic the authors have studied its overall efficacy in removal of both states of arsenic more specifically this study demonstrates the suitability of laterite soil in adsorption of arsenic variation in adsorption property at different degree of treatment of ph physical state effect of particle size adsorbent dose and contact time using different isotherm models moreover the study of breakthrough time for adsorption column is done using logit model the effluent properties of the column are measured and alternative filter model for efficient arsenic removal is proposed along with suggesting potential modification of existing household and community based filters this study is focused mainly on the potential viability of using laterite bed in the existing kaf filter to effectively remove coliform and arsenic contaminant especially as iii species the use of activated carbon provides improved value of coliform control the laterite bed layer can further be acid activated to enhance overall arsenic adsorption efficacy and use of activated charcoal to enhance pathogens removal the absence of sulphate deposits as product of acid activation furthers assures the availability of active protonated surface of adsorbent in the filter system similarly the technical and socio economic feasibility of such system in terai community are studied with comparison to the locally available household filters currently in use in that specific region the authors also have shed light on potential of future research and applicability of laterite media on community based as well as industrial filter systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the laterite samples were collected from four different locations ramche sindhupalchowk 27 47 18 94 n 85 51 43 07 e panchkhal kavre 27 39 40 74 n 85 36 42 83 e chainpur chitwan 27 39 02 44 n 84 34 57 41 e and fasku dolakha 27 37 15 56 n 86 02 04 52 e all four samples were collected after screening off the plant roots debris and gravel pieces from the depth ranging in 1 3 m beneath the earth surface the samples so collected were dried crushed and finally screened through nylon sieve mesh 100 μm and 200 μm to collect laterite particles in between 0 1mm and 0 2 mm in size each sample from each particular location was labeled and stored in airtight vessels under non moisture conditions 2 2 contaminated groundwater samples groundwater samples contaminated by arsenic with contaminations in the range of 65 μg l 435 μg l were collected from various wells marked poisonous by health authorities in terai region of nepal the samples were taken from the wells having depth up to 40 m and stored in capped polyethylene bottles each of these samples were examined for total arsenic concentrations for both as iii and as v state of arsenic apart from these the hardness ph total dissolved solids lead concentration turbidity and other physio chemical properties of the groundwater samples were also analyzed 2 3 preparation of arsenic solutions for preparing standard 1000 μg l arsenite as iii solution 10 ppm of stock solution was first prepared by dissolving sodium arsenite naaso2 supreme chemicals bp in distilled pure water and later diluted to required concentration standard inorganic arsenic v stock solution 1000 μg l was prepared by dissolving disodium arsenate na2haso4 7h2o supreme chemicals bp in distilled water and after further dilution similarly stock solution for arsenic mixture was also brought to the lab for ph adjustments of the solutions hydrochloric acid hcl and sodium hydroxide naoh was used and all the chemicals used were of analytical grade 2 4 preparation of adsorbent for the acid activation of raw laterite rl 100 g of 0 1 0 2 mm particle size raw laterite and 200 ml of 4 n hcl were taken into a 1000 ml glass beaker and subjected to a temperature of 85 5 c with constant stirring for 2 4 h after removing the liquid from the distillation process a total of 400 ml of distilled water was added to the solid fraction after that 2 0 n naoh solution was added and stirred at room temperature to ensure the final ph of the step reached 6 5 to 7 5 the whole mass was further stirred for a couple of hours and left undisturbed for a day to decant off the clear liquid layer from the top the wet solid product was filtered on a whatman grade 512½ cellulose qualitative filter paper washed thoroughly by distilled water for several times oven dried first at 60 c for 3 h and then left to air dry to obtain dry solid acid activated laterite treated laterite tl which was used as an efficient arsenic adsorbent for contaminated groundwater the detailed study of calcium in water in form of hardening bicarbonate salts and general free form should be studied prior to the adsorption tests as calcium counteracts the oxyanion effects of competitive ion movement ahmad et al 2020a 2020b 2020c 2 5 scale up synthesis of tl for larger sets of experiments to be done and filter to be designed the raw laterite was produced into the activated form in large volume for this similar process as in ph activation was used but with greater volume of acid and adsorbent in use for bulk production 4 kg of raw laterite was mixed with 8000 ml of 2 n hcl and similar process was adopted the produced sample was stored and used as adsorbent in proposed filter system further study on the mass production of acid activated laterite stocks and their availability at the designated study application area should be implemented and the rate and mechanism of buffering of laterite sample via presence of calcium salts in water should be thoroughly studied 2 6 characterization of adsorbent sample collected and freed from unwanted impurities were taken from several viable locations and tested for physical and chemical composition the bulk density presence of metal cations and ph of zero net charge as per maiti et al 2007 on adsorbent surface were analyzed and values were tabulated for varying compositions of raw laterite soil collected from four different locations tests were repeated separately for each sample and reported in supplementary material table a 2 elemental analysis of inorganic constituents of raw laterite was done by atomic absorption spectrometer agilent aa5 200 series and automated titration system mettler dl40rc was adopted for hardness analysis of contaminated groundwater and effluent of filter system for determining organic carbon walkey black method modified for automatic titration was followed turoni model 50 200 multifunction digital ph meter was used to evaluate ph and conductivity of solutions throughout the experiment varian 600 atomic adsorption spectrometer with a graphite furnace was used for total arsenic determination and for arsenic species determination the elemental composition of the laterite sample has been tabulated in supplementary materials table a 2 the phzpc zero point charge ph of each laterite sample was found out by method as given by maji et al 2008 2 7 adsorption tests of arsenic on laterite soil 2 7 1 batch experiment batch experiments were conducted to study the change in arsenic removal efficacy of treated laterite with change in ph of the solution at a lab temperature of 25 c addition of 1 2 g of treated laterite was made to 100 ml of arsenic solution i e mixture of as iii and as v solutions of combined 1 ppm concentration in an airtight polyethylene bottles and allowed to be shaken by a mechanical shaker at about 300 400 rpm kept in a temperature controlled water bath experiments for finding optimal value of parameters such as adsorbent dose adsorbent particle size ph of solution detention time form of adsorbent for removal of arsenic combined mixture were carried out for this tests for adsorbent dose in range of 0 40 g l at ph value of 7 5 particle size determination 0 1mm 0 2 mm detention time check for 0 8hrs and ph value test by varying ph of solutions from 1 to 14 were conducted under normal lab temperature and pressure conditions the final products and solutions of all such tests were labeled and analyzed for calculating the final arsenic concentration in them 2 7 1 1 effect of particle size of adsorbents the first lab test was conducted to fix the most efficient adsorbent particle size before analyzing optimum dose and optimum detention time of the adsorbent test modules were operated for a 1000 μg l of lab prepared arsenic solution b collected groundwater sample with varying arsenic doses where 40 g l of adsorbent ranging in particle size from 0 1 mm to 0 2 mm was kept in an attached mechanical shaker operating at 200 rpm for 20 min to check the most efficient particle size the arsenic content before and after the batch test were studied and percentage removal percentage adsorption efficiency of as by the laterite sample was studied in each case 2 7 1 2 effect of contact time also for finding the most suitable detention time static batch tests were carried out for three different sample sizes of 0 16 mm 0 165 mm and 0 17 mm with ph maintained at 7 25 lab temperature of 25 c and adsorbent dose kept constant at 40 g l tests were conducted in all four laterite samples from different locations and repeated for three times in each of them and the average of three outputs were recorded as final data and the most efficient one sample from kavre was reported 2 7 1 3 effect of adsorbent dose after successful selection of 0 165 mm as the average adsorbent particle size six different modules were prepared to test for several adsorbent dose ranging from 5 g l to 40 g l for a total detention time of 1 8 h specifically for detention time of 2 h tests were carried out in six modules so prepared but for detention time of 4 h 3 different trials were made in each of six modules each for a different particle size and average value of them were reported 2 7 1 4 effect of ph with variation in adsorbent size batch experiments were conducted to study the change in arsenic removal efficacy of treated laterite with change in ph of the solution by using 40 g l dose of adsorbent initial arsenic dose of 1 ppm lab synthesized and contaminated groundwater of varying arsenic concentrations subjected to 200 rpm of shaking speed for 10 min under normal lab conditions initial treatment of the raw laterite sample to different ph was carried out by acid activation followed by subsequent washing till the normal ph was restored for respective use of each sample in the batch experiment the solution ph was further balanced and maintained by naoh and hcl solutions for each ph value from 1 to 14 the percentage of arsenic adsorbed by grinded treated laterite 0 165 mm and granular acid treated laterite of grain size 1 2 mm were studied in batch experiments 2 7 2 column experiment for column study treated laterite tl was packed in a minute tower and contacted with the arsenic contaminated lab samples and real groundwater samples collected from highly exposed areas the flow rate was well maintained and the effluent sample was collected at fixed intervals and further analyzed for the remnant of arsenic contaminant left in the solution after a round of adsorption by the column laterite 3 results and discussions characteristics of adsorbents obtained from different samples effects of removal of arsenic on varying operating parameters their adsorption kinetics adsorption equilibrium and adsorption isotherms are discussed in the following sections 3 1 adsorbent characterization the sample from kavre showed maximum arsenic adsorption supplementary material table a 2 in initial evaluation tests which may account to its higher ferric and aluminum hydroxides content maji et al 2008 and also to the harsh weathering condition of the site of collection causing loss of leachate ions and deposition of iron and aluminum compounds in the parent soil the removal of the as iii by fe al compounds is facilitated by sequences of surface adsorption oxidation and the intra particle reduction and the formation of inner and outer surface complexes cheng et al 2016 3 2 adsorptive removal of arsenic 3 2 1 effect of particle size of adsorbents from static batch test it was seen fig 1 a that for particle size of 0 16 0 17 mm the adsorption rate of arsenic was higher the adsorption curve increased gradually with increasing mean particle size of the adsorbent from 0 11 mm 0 17 mm and then with further increment in size the fall in curve was prominent this shows that for sample of 0 1 0 2 mm particle size higher adsorption can be achieved with sizes between 0 16 and 0 17 mm this stated the tendency of the adsorbent to filter off the arsenic contaminant in an increasing fashion up to an optimum particle size the greater value for the sample size after that stage will lead to the loss of surface area and lack of abundant activated sites at the adsorbent surface maji et al 2007 lingamdinne et al 2020 3 2 2 effect of detention time sharp change in curve fig 1b was observed in between detention time of 2 4 h percentage removal of arsenic by adsorbent via adsorption process increased from low value of 25 1 at 1 h detention period to 33 3 at 2 h and then a sharp increment to 88 7 at 4 h detention time after 4 h of detention time the curves flattened to show slow yet gradual increment in removal percentage though higher percentage removal was observed in time period beyond 7 8 h removal percentage reaching 96 98 5 for time efficient filter design 4 h of detention time was chosen as best fit for further tests for a detention time of 4 h adsorbent of particle size 0 165 mm was chosen for the arsenic adsorption for which maximum adsorption was found to be around 98 5 at higher detention time with an increase in detention time the rate remains constant and increase in a very low scale due to the saturation of adsorption sites maji et al 2008 prabhakar et al 2021 3 2 3 effect of adsorbent dose for the adsorbent dose of 40 g l and at a detention time of 4 h about 98 125 fig 1c of arsenic adsorption was seen in the sample when shaker speed was 300 rpm and shaking time fixed at 20 min with increase in adsorbent dose the total number of active sites for adsorption was increased and thus the removal efficiency of adsorbent went on increasing this is due to the availability of free sites for metal cations to get attracted to and the process is further facilitated by the higher adsorption capacity of respective adsorbent media sanou et al 2020a 2020b 3 2 4 effect of ph on arsenic adsorption and effect of physical form of adsorbent the maximum arsenic adsorption of 97 5 fig 1d was shown by sample size 0 165 mm at ph of 4 which gradually went on increasing as the solution became alkaline however after reaching a low value at ph value 12 the rate jumpstart increasing again since with increasing alkalinity of the solution the regeneration of laterite was prominent the value of arsenic removal percentage may have started to increase slightly after ph value 12 in grinded form the adsorption of as iii went on increasing from ph value 1 onwards till a maximum adsorption of 99 84 fig 1e was seen at ph of 8 a slow gradual decline up to 52 3 was seen then till the ph of solution reached 11 with further increase in alkalinity the arsenic removal rate started to increase due to adsorbent regeneration and thus at ph of 14 the percentage removal of arsenic was found to be 63 4 for as v grinded tl showed maximum efficacy 99 66 at ph value 3 followed by a gradual decrement till the ph of solution was 8 an early increase in adsorption rate was seen after the ph crossed that value possibly due to adsorbent regeneration and increase in active reaction sites the value increased from low 40 38 at ph value of 8 63 33 at ph 14 of solution in batch experiments however in granular tl as iii and as v attained maximum adsorption on adsorbent at ph value of 8 and 3 respectively with relatively lower overall efficiency of 82 52 and 84 6 at respective ph after the solution went alkaline the adsorption of as iii and as v were seen minimum at ph 12 38 81 and ph 9 27 4 for granular laterite the effect of change in ph on the rate of adsorption of arsenic by acid activated laterite tl can be described by various mechanism like surface protonation nagar et al 2010 ligand exchange partey et al 2009 chemical interaction ion exchange electrostatic attraction repulsion the ph for zero net charge on laterite soil was determined by potentiometric titrations thereby reporting a value of phzpc as 6 39 below that ph the soil surface is positively charged by surface protonation favored under acidic conditions and when ph crosses phzpc value the soil surface gains negative charge under alkaline condition lim et al 2021 the efficacy of adsorption is then affected by the charge nature at soil surface interface and the type of arsenic species abundant at that ph range better illustrated by following governing reactions fig 2 at soil interface when the ph of the solution is well below phzpc point of zero charge h2aso4 has the highest concentration in the soil ph 2 and since the soil has gained positive surface charges due to acidity of the medium h2aso4 binds with the surface cations of the soil zhu et al 2021 the feasibility of this process of attraction of opposite charges is high as h2aso4 requires less energy for binding and ph of solution is less than 6 7 but when ph starts to increase the rate shows gradual declination suggesting that less cations are being released to the soil surface interface relative to the greater concentration of monocharged arsenic species lim et al 2021 thanh nguyen et al 2020 the rate declines and reaches it lowest at ph value of 11 5 as the ph of solution starts increasing and ph phzpc 0 the soil surface starts accumulating negative charges saadon et al 2018 in addition to this free release of competitive hydroxyl ions oh is prominent in the solution the dominant arsenic species at ph phzpc 6 39 is haso4 2 which now has to compete with hydroxyl ions for relatively less positive binding sites in soil surface bhattacharjee et al 2021 and the higher binding energy requirement of haso4 2 species of arsenic maqsood et al 2021 for arsenate as v the maximum adsorption was seen at ph value of 3 for both grinded and granular state of acid activated laterite samples the removal efficiency of treated laterite showed an increment from ph value 1 to ph value 3 as we neared the stable ph range of 3 4 for haso4 species at ph value 3 the graph showed the maximum removal of arsenate as 99 66 and 84 6 for grinded and granular form respectively as the ph of solution batch just crossed phzpc of 6 39 soil sample from kavre that means nearing the neutral ph value the concentration of h2aso4 and haso42 was nearly equal in the solution thereby making electrostatic attraction mechanism no longer feasible dissanayake et al 2021 as chemical reaction mechanism for neutral species began formulating the arsenate removal adsorption rate decreased to its minimum value of 40 38 at ph 8 and 27 4 at ph 9 for grinded treated laterite and granular treated laterite respectively as 1 n naoh solution was being used to maintain ph of the solution the used adsorbent loaded with monoarsenious adsorbate underwent regeneration bandara et al 2020 and thus increased number of fresh active positive sites for attracting diarsenious species at higher ph maiti et al 2007 the chemical sorption of specific anions at alkaline condition and the ion attraction process which just got induced led to slow but gradual increase in adsorption of as v on regenerated laterite beyond ph of 8 in case of adsorption of as iii species on treated laterite it follows inner sphere sorption behavior above phzpc value and below it outer sphere mechanism is inherited partey 2008 inner sphere complexes are formed when monodentate ligand exchange mechanism takes place between hydroxyl ion on laterite soil surface and arsenite species maiti et al 2007 aredes et al 2013 which can be described in equation as 1 moh s h3aso3 aq mh2aso3 h2o where m abundant metal cation for laterite soil fe and al h3aso3 denotes neutral arsenite species at ph beyond 8 similar interactions of arsenic species on soil surface interface are enumerated as 2 2 moh s h3aso3 aq mhaso3m 2h2o 3 moh s h2aso4 aq mh2aso4 oh 4 moh s 2 h2aso4 aq mh2aso4 h2o the maximum adsorption efficiency of treated laterite for as iii species was observed at ph 8 as 99 84 82 52 fig 1c for grinded and granular form of treated adsorbent material respectively the curve then suffers a slow decline up to ph of 11 and 12 for grinded and granular treated laterite respectively this fluctuation in granular form can be attributed to the lesser surface area for reaction and low rate of attraction for species of favorable ph range due to inactivated surface cations after which due to adsorbent regeneration by naoh addition the removal rate for arsenite species started to show minute rise lim et al 2021 the added naoh for regeneration not only increased the ph value of solution favoring distribution of alkaline suitable arsenic species but also helped in replenishing used adsorbent by ligand displacement reaction of hydroxyl ions with arsenic species thereby increasing the number of active sites for reaction jang et al 2005 3 3 adorption isotherms experiments were conducted in batch at normal lab temperature of 25 c ph value of 6 5 7 5 shaking done at 240 300 rpm with dose of treated laterite in range of 5 40 g l and contaminant as mixture in initial concentration of 1000 μg l the determination of maximum adsorption capacity of adsorbent was done by plotting langmuir and freundlich isotherm from the test data fig 3 a and fig 3 b for a adsorbent adsorbate solution the langmuir isotherm can be illustrated linearly as 5 1 q e 1 qbc e 1 q where qe refers to the solute adsorbed at equilibrium in mg g 1 and ce denotes equilibrium solute concentration mg dm 3 in solution sarkar et al 2006 from the plotted graph fig 3a the linear plot equation was derived as y 0 2197x 5 7566 with regression r2 value of 0 9912 where y 1 q e x 1 c e with further calculations from received values of slope m and y intercept c of linearized langmuir isotherm maximum adsorption capacity of treated laterite qmax was calculated as 0 173 mg g and langmuir adsorption constant for adsorption energy b was found to be 26 310 l mg to determine the overall feasibility and spontaneity of reaction a constant term called rl and standard gibbs free energy change are correspondingly analyzed as maji et al 2008 6 r l 1 1 bc 0 where c0 denotes initial concentration of arsenic ppm and b refers to value of langmuir isotherm constant and from calculation isotherm shape can be defined as if value of rl 1 the isotherm is linear rl 1 the adsorption process is favorable rl 1 the adsorption process is unfavorable and for rl 0 the reaction process is irreversible the value of rl for treated laterite in our experiment was calculated to be 0 3661 that refers to the process being favorable with values of b derived from langmuir isotherm plot the standard gibbs free energy change δ g is calculated to check for the spontaneity of the overall adsorption process of arsenic species on treated laterite batch samples the equation regarding free energy change is given as 7 ln 1 b δ g rt where r the universal gas constant with value of 8 3145 j mol 1 k 1 b refers to langmuir isotherm constant and t is the absolute temperature of lab experiments 298 k in our case the then calculated value for δg was 8 1020 kj mol 1 the negative value denoting the spontaneous nature of adsorption process maji et al 2008 the freundlich model of isotherm analysis is shown by the equation 8 ln q e lnk f 1 n lnc e where constants kf denotes adsorption capacity and n denotes adsorption intensity the linear plot between lnqe and lnce fig 3b provides a linear line equation as y 0 5547x 0 7633 where x lnce and y lnqe with slope 0 5547 and intercept of 0 7633 and r2 of 0 9463 a value of n as 1 8027 l mg gives the adsorption intensity and value of kf as 0 4661 provides an insight on capacity of adsorption of arsenic species on treated laterite comparing the regression values for both langmuir and freundlich isotherms r2 langmuir 0 9912 r2 freundlich 0 9463 it was seen that the adsorption process best fits the langmuir isotherm plot langmuir isotherm model assumes that the adsorbent surface is homogenous and the favorable binding sites are distributed uniformly with same affinity for the ions similarly the process of adsorption will take place until a monolayer absorbate layer in developed at the surface aredes et al 2013 and is limited by the adsorbent s capacity and availability of sites boglione et al 2019 based on our experiments and the fitting of data with the langmuir isotherm the arsenic adsorption process is suggested to follow monolayer adsorption through homogenously activated surface of laterite soil boglione et al 2019 3 4 kinetics study for adsorption the kinetics and mechanism behind the as adsorption on laterite surface was analyzed by plotting first order reaction model based upon the concentration of solution lagergren pseudo first order reaction model on solid capacity second order reaction model based on metal ion adsorption and pseudo second order sorption reaction model of ho and mckay first order reaction model based upon the solution concentration first order reaction model can be illustrated as nazari et al 2021 9 lnc t lnc 0 k 1 t to obtain the regression coefficient a linear plot was made for lnct and time t fig 3c which showed a poor regression value of 0 8275 indicating the adsorption did not follow the first order reaction model that well pseudo first order reaction model the pseudo first order kinetic model based on the solid capacity for sorption analysis is of the form wong et al 2004 10 dq t dt ks 1 q 1 q t integrating above equation with the boundary condition t 0 to t t and qt 0 to qt qt gives the linearized form as shown by following equation 11 ln q 1 q t ln q 1 ks 1 t a linear plot made for ln q1 qt versus t fig 3d featured a correlation coefficient r2 0 9478 which further shows that the adsorption did not follow the pseudo first order reaction model 3 4 1 second order reaction model based upon adsorption of metal ions the second order rate equation can be represented in equation as ho 2006 12 dc t dt k 2 c t 2 rearranging the above equation followed by integration over the boundary condition of t 0 to t t and ct 0 to ct ct provides 13 1 c t 1 c 0 k 2 t hence the linear plot of 1 ct versus time t fig 3e produces a correlation coefficient of r2 0 9581 which is greater than pseudo first order model value but still not sufficient enough 3 4 2 pseudo second order model the data can finally be fitted to the pseudo second order model stated as ho and mckay 1999 14 dq t dt k q e q t 2 after integrating to the boundary condition of t 0 to t and qt 0 to qt and rearranging the terms we get 15 t q t 1 h t q e a linear plot of t qt against t fig 3f produces a regression value r2 0 9737 better than previous models which states ho and mckay s model as the best fit kinetic reaction model for arsenic adsorption on treated laterite soil surface 3 5 adsorption column and breakthrough study the column study for adsorption on fixed bed of treated laterite was done by introducing real contaminated groundwater sample collected from severely affected district of terai zone of nepal a minute circular tower of 0 35 cm diameter 400 mm height flow rate of 210 cm h and initial concentration of as of 200 μg l was modeled and plot for c co vs time t was made to find breakthrough time and exhaust time at c co of 0 3 and c co of 0 85 breakthrough time was found to be 0 76 h and exhaust time was calculated to be 2 h from fig 4 b logit method of column design was inherited to analyze the value of adsorption rate constant k and adsorption capacity coefficient n the logit equation can be expressed in the form of dhoble et al 2017 16 ln c c o 1 c c o k n x v k c o t where co initial dose of arsenic in groundwater sample 200 μg l c concentration at any time v approach velocity 0 035 m min x bed depth 200 mm k adsorption rate constant l mg hour and n adsorption capacity coefficient mg l rearranging above equation as 17 ln c c o c k n x v k c o t the linear plot of l n c c 0 c versus time fig 4a provides a straight line of slope equation y 0 307x 4 2467 r2 0 9739 where slope is given by kco and intercept as k n x v from where values of constant k and n can be found out for column study the adsorption rate constant k was found out from the logit model as 1 535 l mg hour and adsorption capacity coefficient n as 29 04 mg l the tabulated quantitative values for adsorption column study is shown in supplementary material table a 3 the higher coefficient of adsorption for treated laterite tl in column studies showed that it possessed better adsorption potential than other adsorbents such as clay minerals and kaolinites khan and imteaz 2021 geolites huo et al 2021 and ferric oxides alka et al 2021a 2021b red soil pigna et al 2020 and biomass altowayti et al 2021 therefore compared to the most applicable natural absorbent systems tl shows better performance and greater potential to be incorporated in practical filter models 3 6 post water effluent quality a check was made for the initial and final water quality parameters after a successful filtration cycle from prepared fixed bed adsorption column no leaching of iron or other trace elements onto the effluent water was seen and the ph of the output water was found to be in range of 6 7 7 2 arsenic and lead concentrations were within the safety limit thereby satisfying who permissible guidance and showing less fluctuation from initial value of collected groundwater samples the hard water laced with bicarbonate salts can alter the process of the treatment for acid activate laterite one of the alternatives is to treat the raw laterite to the desired ph level and perform a heat treatment on it another approach would be to treat the raw laterite with acid solution and then wash it multiple times with alkaline solution with an aim of surface activation and cleansing the pore sizes on the surface of the adsorbent will be activated and the protonation degree will be increased thereby drawing more arsenic cations towards it this will further eradicate the problem of bicarbonate salt buffering the acidified adsorbent the best remedy would be to activate the surface of the so used adsorbent and drop it to its original near neutral ph level and then conduct the experiments the development of oxyanions in the solution can reduce the rate of formation of ferric precipitates from the adsorption process while looking to design suitable water filter or treatment plants the availability of calcium salts in the water sample groundwater influent must be studied properly ahmad et al 2020a 2020b 2020c the rate of removal or separation of fe iii precipitates from water can be heavily influenced by the presence and concentration of calcium in the water source calcium in simpler forms or even as salts can enhance the rate of ferric precipitates and the buffering of treated adsorbent may commence ahmad et al 2020a 2020b 2020c the precipitated products can be properly separated but the rate at which the available calcium reduces the oxyanion effects on adsorption and enhance fe iii precipitate growth must be studied prior to the preparation of new filter system ahmad et al 2020a 2020b 2020c maiti et al 2007 as per recent studies the adsorption of arsenite is comparatively less efficient than that of arsenate in normal groundwater condition of near neutral ph of 6 5 7 this is due to the fact that arsenate as v is negatively charged and arsenite as iii is neutral ahmad et al 2020a 2020b 2020c the availability of competitive oxyanions in the groundwater and the presence of reactive humic acids declines the rate of arsenic adsorption to the fe iii precipitates via competitive adsorption on surface of adsorbent ahmad et al 2020a 2020b 2020c 3 7 applicability of laterite soil for adsorption of heavy metal ions the viable uses of laterite as an efficient natural adsorbent for removal of heavy metal ions from aqueous solutions have been studied in several researches and the findings are summarized in supplementary material table a 4 the table showed that treated laterite soil has high adsorption efficiency for heavy metals such as mercury strontium chromium lead and fluoride among the listed metals lead removal was relatively high at around 74 and studied in previous reputed research chatterjee et al 2018 the adsorption column was also studied for its efficacy in removal of lead and respective comparison with previous study was made the granular laterite showed huge potential in removing lead pb ii from contaminated groundwater for the short pilot batch adsorption study however more works regarding its adsorption and favoring mechanisms are essential 3 8 comparison of treated laterite soil with other natural and modified natural adsorbents the arsenic removal efficiency of acid activated laterite was compared with other suitable natural and modified natural adsorbents and their respective removal efficacy optimum ph of operation and maximum arsenic adsorption capacity were accessed and presented in supplementary material table a 5 as compared to previous similar laterite based studies tl had better values for maximum adsorption capacity similarly table a 5 shows that for modified adsorbents such as red mud and activated alumina the actual removal percentage was low it was reported as 37 3 and 96 2 respectively for red mud and activated alumina although both featured a better adsorption capacity initially furthermore the initial adsorbent dose required for the arsenic removal was also low for tl as compared to the other natural adsorbent and modified adsorbent the contact time of study and the ph range of study were both higher for laterite soil as compared to other adsorbents indexed in table a 5 apart for the usual arsenic adsorption affinity treated laterite also showed enhanced adsorption rates for other heavy metal cations as showed in supplementary table a 4 3 9 regeneration of adsorption media the bed layer of acid activated laterite used in filter operation was treated with 600 ml of 1 n naoh solution at 0 615 l h rate of flow the regenerated laterite sample was washed with distilled water for about 5 7 times until the ph value reached 6 2 6 5 and then left for 10 15 h and adsorption test was carried out to check the discrepancy in efficiency of laterite after passing the arsenic loaded groundwater samples of contamination level of 300 450 μg l through the regenerated filter bed layer of treated laterite a change in adsorption efficiency by 0 2 0 4 was seen for eight different checks this showed that the used adsorbent can efficiently maintain its adsorption capacity post the alkali treatment although the removal efficiency increased initially due to the alkali treatment and creation of more favorable reaction sites jang et al 2005 the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent slowly declines with each cycle of regeneration as shown in previous experiments maiti et al 2007 a relative loss of 2 3 in the arsenic adsorption capacity of laterite was prominent after the first cycle of regeneration treatment by naoh causes the increase in active sites for reaction sanou et al 2020a 2020b and increase in pore size of adsorbent media thereby facilitating overall adsorption maji et al 2008 however the economic consistency for terai households should be considered for long term run of filter 3 10 proposal of design of household arsenic filter based on results of column test we propose an alternative laterite based household filter fig 5 a for efficient arsenic pathogens as well as heavy metals removal the proposed filter system would consist of 97 cm tall chamber 1 m including base thickness and 35 cm internal diameter with following constituents from top to bottom a freeboard of 12 cm for raw water 5 cm bed layer of brick chips for effective diffusion of water grinded acid activated laterite particle size 0 165 mm of 20 cm depth 30 cm fine sand bed particle size 1 mm activated charcoal of bed depth 10 cm coarse sand 1 2 mm of depth 10 cm and gravel base varying size in range of 2 8 mm of depth 20 cm followed by a polyester cloth for providing clean water to the outlet tap for construction of filter properly washed gravel bed is prepared and placed in a plastic or concrete case followed by a layer of coarse sand and activated charcoal fine sand can be obtained by sieving with sieve size 1 mm before integrating laterite soil as a layer in the filter laterite soil about 4 kg should be freed from deleterious particles grinded and washed thoroughly with potable water more efficiency can be obtained by using treated laterite acid activated at ph of 4 and well washed before use maintenance of the filter should be done properly to ensure the well functioning and effluent to be within allowable limit it includes both the regular periodic maintenance tasks as well as emergency maintenance during breakdown of the filter the adsorbent media laterite soil activated charcoal and sand should be cleaned on periodic basis based on monitoring to ensure availability of surface for adsorption of arsenic as well as removal of pathogens the mass scaling of activated laterite can be done by a local level project with a fund deposit from national governing bodies the easy transport and storage of produced laterite stock can be managed at a local warehouse or a central storage from where it can be easily distributed to the place of demand however all such analysis has not been made in this paper as the technical analysis of product and its distribution has not been thoroughly studied if feasible the filter media should be replaced annually or based on pilot tests to ascertain adsorption capacity moreover pilot tests are imperative for adjustment in the dimensions proposed and to determine the actual efficiency as well as filtration capacity of filters the filter system is a proposed one and field tests were not conducted the efficacy of such system has been proposed through detailed analysis of the removal potential of adsorbent media used and coliform controlling bed layer incorporated into the system 3 11 potential enhancement of existing filters potential enhancement on arsenic removal efficiency can also be obtained by modification of the most commonly used existing filters for household community as well as industrial use 3 11 1 modification on kanchan arsenic filter enhancement on kaf can be made by integrating a layer of laterite above the sand layer below diffusion chamber containing iron nails which improves arsenic and other heavy metals such as manganese cadmium lead antimony mercury nickel and copper removal capacity moreover integrating a bed of charcoal 10 cm in between fine sand and coarse sand layers enhances pathogen removal and adsorption of iron and manganese ions from the water sample thus allowing the effluent within the desired standards overall dimensions of layers of the filter are demonstrated in fig 5b 3 11 2 modification of industrial and community based bio sand filter another potential use of treated laterite bed could be in the typical community based bio sand filters timalsina et al 2021 where arsenic removal efficiency is low and requires remedies in those communities where water supply is based on single source improvement of community based filter can play life saver role of hundreds of people of that community community based model of slow bio sand filter with separate compartments for treatment and storage consists of initial influent tower packed with gravels of varying sizes 8 mm 4 mm and 2 mm with washout valves for cleansing impurities the water then enters the sand bed tower where treated laterite 0 165 mm and activated charcoal between two filter sand beds fig 5c the effluent is piped through pores of coarse bed aggregate into the treated water chamber and tapped out for drinking purposes 3 12 comparative study existing and proposed filters the comparative study between the existing filter systems and proposed filter has been made in terms of technical as well as socio economic feasibility the extant and most efficient filter in terai region of nepal has been kanchan arsenic filter kaf which was incorporated after modifications and upgrades in 2 kolshi and 3 kolshi filter systems were made ogata et al 2020 ngai et al 2006 studies have shown lacking efficacy of all three filters in removal of coliform and arsenite the coagulants and oxidants aided 2 kolshi filter flaunted a maximum arsenic removal efficiency of 95 which was relatively lower than 3 kolshi s value at 99 supplementary material table a 1 in terms of iron removal 2 kolshi was better with 99 success rate while 3 kolshi had a satisfactory value around 90 the lacking pathogen removal efficacy was a major problem in previous filters as 2 kolshi showed 93 of removal rate while kaf featured a poor performance with just 60 of removal efficiency ngai et al 2007 the proposed modified filter utilizes the additional laterite adsorbent bed to filter off arsenite from the influent and also make use of the activated carbon layer to check coliform colony growth the cost breakdown of the proposed filter system for installation is shown in supplementary materials table a 6 the operation and maintenance cost are for both scheduled tasks and the emergency breakdown responses scheduled tasks include cleaning replacing iron nails and washing sand gravels and laterite the sand should be washed every 6 12 months to maintain the sorption capacity while iron nails can last for about 3 years timalsina et al 2021 ngai et al 2006 local vendors have been supplying constructing the kaf 2 kolshi and 3 kolshi filters the treatment rate high usage rate easiness of construction distribution as well as simplicity in operation and maintenance has been studied from past studies as well as verified at the field conditions supplementary material table a 7 the initial cost for construction of the proposed filter is higher than the existing kaf by nominal amount 5 to 10 it includes the cost for addition of charcoal and laterite bed layer however the proposed system would require less maintenance cost as the laterite bed layer acts as additional sorption layer requiring less frequent cleaning of the sand and gravel bed layers on the other hand 2 kolshi and 3 kolshi filters are cheaper for installation in the beginning but have higher operation cost due to need of coagulants as well as frequent clogging thus the use of laterite as an additional adsorbent layer in the existing system would lead to greater efficiency and less o m cost with nominal increase in the installation cost 4 conclusion the use of acid activated laterite as adsorbent was found to be economic and efficient in removal of both as iii and as v species of arsenic from the contaminated groundwater batch study showed that the most efficient optimum particle size for treated laterite is 0 165 mm adsorbent dose is 40 g l and detention time is 4 h the study revealed that at ph value of 3 the adsorption efficiency of arsenate as v was maximum at 99 66 and for arsenite as iii maximum adsorption on laterite was 98 84 seen at ph 8 from isotherm studies it was enumerated that the adsorption process was best fit by langmuir plot with regression value r2 of 0 9912 and maximum adsorption capacity of 0 173 mg g the rl value of 0 3661 enlightens that the reaction process is favorable and δ go value of 8 1020 kj mol 1 depicts the spontaneous nature of adsorption process it was observed that the adsorption mechanism followed pseudo second order reaction kinetics with r2 value of 0 9737 the logit model design of column of height 40 mm and diameter 0 35 cm had an adsorption rate constant of 1 535 l mg hour and adsorption capacity coefficient n of 29 04 mg l the tests of effluents passed from fixed bed adsorption column showed that no leaching of iron or other trace elements like cu and al into the effluent of filter was present since laterite also possessed high adsorption capacity for other heavy metals such as ni cd mn pb co and activated charcoal had higher efficiency of removal of harmful pathogens and iron ions from groundwater influent the use of acid activated laterite as filter media incorporated with activated charcoal bed was found favorable and more efficient thus laterite can be a better adsorbent for arsenic removal its application in the arsenic filter can enhance the efficiency of arsenic filters thus detailed studies are essential to verify the enhancement

11799,fluid flow modeling in porous media requires solving relevant governing equations which are inherently nonlinear however some simplifications are usually made to make them linear one of those common assumptions is invariant rock properties with respect to reservoir pressure however there are some situations including pressure dependent porous media where this assumption would not be applicable hence the solution of the nonlinear diffusivity equation shall be sought for such cases the main goal of this study is to present a new analytical solution to the diffusivity equation and a numerical scheme considering exponential decreases in the petrophysical properties with reservoir pressure the diffusivity equation was solved using the assumed exponential functions and analytical solutions are provided in this paper besides computational fluid dynamics methods were utilized to verify the accuracy of the derived equations the developed analytical equations and numerical scheme were then applied over several pressure dependent porous media cases and our comparison study showed that neglecting the pressure dependency of the petrophysical properties will lead to significant errors approximately 40 based on the introduced solutions we also proposed a new set of type curves that can be used in well testing analyses of the deformable porous media graphical abstract image 1 keywords pressure dependent porous media computational fluid dynamics cfd diffusivity equation well testing type curves 1 introduction to fulfill the increased demand for energy it is crucial to envision the production of hydrocarbons from unconventional reservoirs production from these reservoirs is usually a challenging and costly task to overcome these challenges a comprehensive analysis is required usually we deal with high pressure underground reservoirs in which a considerable pressure drop occurs during its production phase since geomechanics proved that petrophysical properties are pressure dependent due to the compressibility hall 1953 these properties must be considered as a function of pressure in general mckee et al 1988a depletion of reservoirs with time increases the overburden pressure and causes pores closure leading to permeability and porosity reduction ren and guo 2014 it is assumed that early pressure drop at the wellbore in some cases is related to this permeability reduction due to pressure drop likewise fluid injection also alters the permeability and porosity of the reservoir cappa et al 2018 the magnitude of the pressure dependency of the formation is related to the formation compressibility parameter fractured reservoirs including unconventional naturally fractured reservoirs coal bed methane reservoirs and tight shale gas reservoirs with hydraulic fractures play a major role in petroleum engineering since many of the remaining hydrocarbon reserves are trapped in these reservoirs fractured reservoirs consist of two different systems namely matrices and fractures numerous laboratory experiments were conducted to evaluate the effect of pressure on petrophysical properties results of laboratory measurements for fracture medium express that petrophysical properties for fractures cannot be assumed constant since porosity and permeability are strongly pressure dependent jones 1975 walsh 1981 dong et al 2010 david et al 1994a brace et al 1968 wibberley 2002 ghabezloo et al 2009a wang et al 2018 this pressure dependency also exists in matrix media but it is not considerable however this pressure dependency is more severe in fracture media so it must be considered aguilera 2006 therefore it is assumed that the petrophysical properties of the matrix remain almost invariant with respect to pressure while fracture properties such as its porosity and permeability which are functions of fracture s opening considerably change with the changes in the reservoir pressure therefore the solution of the linearized diffusivity equation with no pressure dependency in the petrophysical properties might lead to erroneous predictions of the dynamic behavior of the porous system leading to fallacious management studies of the fractured reservoir therefore a new solution to the diffusivity equation is needed for accurate predictions of the flow and pressure within the fracture medium it should be noted that this is not limited to energy production from hydrocarbon reservoirs energy production is not the only issue and there are several other problems associated with material casting and environmental concerns that require additional attention giwa et al 2021 coppola et al 2021 gaudio et al 2021 several authors have tried to address the pressure dependency of the reservoir parameters in the diffusivity equation vairogs et al 1971 assumed stress dependent permeability and proposed a mathematical model for gas flow in tight gas reservoirs they showed that permeability reduction significantly affects the production from the reservoir raghavan et al 1972 presented a numerical method to investigate the impact of pressure dependent rock and fluid properties on the well flow test the effect of pressure dependent permeability on gas production and well testing analysis was studied by ostensen 1986 as well settari and mourits 1994 suggested considering a three dimensional stress field and then coupled their model with a reservoir simulator to obtain an accurate solution for the pressure dependent reservoirs instead some researchers kikani and pedrosa 1991 palmer and mansoori 1996 have assumed petrophysical properties as a function of pressure rather than the full stress tensor those researchers acclaimed that the error generated by this assumption is acceptable wu and pruess 2000 proposed a semi analytical solution to characterize the transient flow within the porous medium assuming pressure dependent permeability lo et al 2002 investigated fluid flow in deformable porous media assuming rock as an elastic solid raghavan and chin 2002 introduced a correlation to evaluate productivity losses due to stress dependent permeability an analytical model for pressure dependent permeability was proposed by shi and durucan 2004 they verified the proposed model by data from coal bed fields similar to the previous studies permeability reduction due to the increases in the confining pressure was observed yin et al 2007 studied the impact of pressure on poroelastic reservoirs and showed that it has a significant effect and should be considered for well testing analysis liu et al and wang et al wang et al 2016a liu et al 2010 conducted experiments to investigate the impact of compaction on fluid flow in fractures they found a negative exponential relationship between confining pressure and permeability the effects of permeability reduction on the loss of productivity was studied by clarkson et al 2013 the concept of pressure dependent permeability in tight gas reservoirs was applied to naturally fractured reservoirs by qanbari and clarkson 2013 cho et al 2013 investigated the effect of pressure dependent natural fracture permeability on production from shale gas wells in a theoretical study chen et al 2015 presented a correlation between fracture permeability and effective stress for shale gas reservoirs in addition they also studied the dependency of fracture compressibility on shale gas properties an experiment was conducted by huo and benson 2016 to investigate the stress dependency of relative permeability in fractures they demonstrated that relative permeability curves shift quickly from one model to another abbasi et al 2017 focused on another simplifying assumption of the diffusivity equation to analyze fluid flow in fractures taking into account the nonlinear quadratic pressure gradient tabatabaie et al 2017 presented a fluid flow equation in a pressure sensitive formation with pressure dependent permeability in 1d flow they stated that the linear flow in fractures should be considered for analyzing tight fractured formations analytical fluid flow modeling in porous media in the open literature is not limited to linear 1d flow nabizadeh et al 2020 proposed an analytical solution for spherical fluid flow modeling through porous media with non uniform initial pressure conditions an extensive microscale experiment was conducted by arshadi et al 2017 to analyze the impact of deformation on fluid flow through fractured samples they observed a significant permeability reduction due to confining pressure increment proving that the fracture medium is strongly pressure dependent liu et al 2018 studied the impact of shear stress on fracture network permeability and its effect on fluid flow they showed that this effect is not negligible and plays a decisive role apart from analytical and semi analytical studies for fluid flow modeling through porous media there are several numerical approaches like the monte carlo method curcio et al 2018 petrosino et al 2019 2020 the lattice boltzmann method lbm zhao et al 2020 wang et al 2016b boek and venturoli 2010 and direct numerical simulation dns adibifard et al 2020 nabizadeh et al 2019 although these numerical methods are associated with numerical errors they could provide a deep understanding of multi scale fluid flow in complex porous systems where analytical and semi analytical results are inapplicable although numerous research studies have been devoted to developing numerical or semi analytical solutions for reservoirs with stress dependent permeability an analytical solution in the time domain while both pressure dependent permeability and porosity are considered is usually ignored several references are cited within the manuscript which utilized complex nonlinear functions for permeability and porosity the significance of the presented methodology is providing an analytical solution considering nonlinear exponential permeability and porosity functions solved in the time domain the provided model can be used not only to characterize pressure dependent reservoirs but also to verify numerical studies with complex functions where an analytical solution is impossible therefore this study aims to introduce a new exact analytical solution by assuming the pressure dependency of permeability and porosity and a numerical scheme to model deformable porous media in the following section the corresponding partial differential equation pde is solved analytically and numerically for constant rate and constant pressure inner boundary conditions at the wellbore subsequently the veracity of the developed equations has been verified using the developed numerical scheme several issues justify the application of the proposed analytical solution rather than numerical methods first and foremost the accuracy of analytical solutions is not comparable to numerical methods especially for practical applications where the pressure drop magnitude is comparatively high e g near wellbore condition and flow through fracture indeed simplifications assumptions and numerical discretizations are associated with numerical modeling while those simplifying assumptions are eliminated from the analytical solutions moreover the scalability of the numerical methods is another issue that justifies the employment of analytical approaches these fast and accurate methodologies apply to real scale scenarios without frustration while numerical methods are computationally demanding and might be impossible under particular circumstances finally the proposed analytical solution in this study could provide a valuable basis for future studies where additional complexities could be imposed on the system commercial software packages e g well test analysis packages use analytical equations for modeling this study s generalized analytical solution is a step toward accurate analysis of more complicated and realistic scenarios 2 mathematical modeling researchers presented different correlations to consider porosity and permeability as functions of pressure in one of the studies in this field chen et al 2015 established a correlation between fracture permeability and reservoir pressure in their correlation they assumed an exponential relationship between permeability and pressure the exponential function of pressure was proposed by other researchers too dong et al 2010 wu and pruess 2000 wang et al 2016a liu et al 2009 2010 chen and li 2008 xiao et al 2009 it should be noted that the pressure dependency of permeability is higher than the porosity based on previous studies in this field pressure dependency functions in this study were defined as 1a k p k 0 e β p p i 1b φ p φ 0 e α p p i 1c k k 0 φ φ 0 n eq 1c is somehow originated from the carman kozeny equation in which the relationship between permeability and porosity is described by k φ 3 1 φ 2 gu and chalaturnyk 2006 hommel et al 2018 mckee et al 1988b in low porosity less than 1 formations the permeability porosity relation can be expressed as k φ 3 in which the permeability multiplier is considered 3 by the original carman kozeny equation gu and chalaturnyk 2006 hommel et al 2018 mckee et al 1988b however this exponent could not satisfy the permeability porosity variations for all types of formations with different characteristics david et al 1994b raghavan and chin 2004 instead a general power law relationship between permeability and porosity is defined with a variable permeability multiplier eq 1c used in several studies chin et al 1998 ghabezloo et al 2009b pang et al 2016 jun jia et al 2017 kozhevnikov et al 2021 to predict permeability variation the permeability multiplier n is defined as a fitting parameter with a particular value for specific rock types and is commonly obtained via fitting experimental data hommel et al 2018 jun jia et al 2017 nevertheless more than a fitting parameter the permeability multiplier physically relates to changes in pore geometry that occurred during the evolving processes mineral dissolution mineral precipitation chemical alteration stress dependency and in general all procedures that affect the pore structure of a specific formation bernab 2003 luquot et al 2014 carroll et al 2013 garing et al 2015 are among those processes for better illustrations we assumed initial values of 100 md and 0 2 for permeability and porosity respectively and they were calculated as functions of pressure the results are plotted in fig 1 for permeability and porosity as functions of pressure assuming different values of α and β clearly the order of pressure dependency is proportional to the formation s compressibility higher values of rock s compressibility lead to more pressure dependency in our equations α is a representative of the rock compressibility cr and we assume it is constant in our equations appendix a ahmed and mckinney stewart ahmed and mckinney 2011 stewart 2011 proposed the diffusivity equation for modeling fluid flow in porous media assuming the pressure dependency of the porosity and permeability the diffusivity equation turns into a nonlinear partial differential equation pde 2 x k p p x φ p μ c t p t in the following sections the above nonlinear diffusivity equation is solved for constant rate and constant pressure inner boundary conditions similar to our previously published analytical modeling manuscript nabizadeh et al 2020 2 1 constant rate solution in this section the inner boundary condition i e well was assumed to produce at a constant production rate and the outer boundary condition was assumed to be under constant pressure this assumption is equivalent to many realistic cases in which well is producing at a constant rate under steady state circumstances water drive reservoirs are an example of reservoirs producing under steady state conditions 2 1 1 constant rate solution pressure

numerical modelling using finite element method fem in this section governing equations regarding single phase fluid flow in porous media are derived developed equations are discretized and solved by finite element methods and their results are compared with the analytical solution 2 3 1 governing equations darcy s law and the continuity equation are necessary to describe fluid flow through porous media in this case the pressure gradient is the driving force for the fluid flow therefore the continuity equation and the general darcy s law for single phase flow are 60a u k μ p ρ g 60b t ρ φ ρ u q m in the above equation ρ is the fluid density φ is porosity and qm is the mass source term substituting darcy s law equation with the velocity term in the continuity equation yields 61 t ρ φ ρ k μ p

substituting eq 63 into eq 61 yields 64 ρ φ c t p t ρ k μ p ρ g q m given that the desired geometry has a small scale the effect of gravitational force could be neglected in eq 64 pressure dependent permeability and porosity parameters are defined as exponential functions and the mass source term is neglected the final equation for incompressible single phase fluid flow in a deformable porous media is 65 φ 0 c t e α p p i p t k 0 μ x e β p p i p x 0 in the above equation k 0 is initial permeability and φ 0 is initial porosity to solve eq 65 the finite element numerical method is utilized bathe 2006 reddy 2004 the abovementioned nonlinear pde is discretized and transformed into a weak formulation according to the galerkin finite element method and the quadratic basis functions were used to approximate the dependent variable i e pressure hutton 2004 2 3 2 geometry boundary conditions and meshing the geometry intended for solving the equation is a rectangular channel the mapped mesh method is used with quad elements for mesh generation to evaluate the quality of the generated mesh a mesh convergence analysis was performed using five different meshes with 9856 22029 36396 58975 and 268176 quad elements after comparing the results of these different meshes the mesh with 36396 quad elements was selected for the rest of the numerical simulations obtained pressure drop values from the simulations are considered as a measure to select an appropriate mesh scenario the results of the mesh sensitivity analysis are reported in table 1 after comparing the results of these different meshes the mesh with 36396 quad elements with appropriate accuracy and the computational cost was selected for the rest of the numerical simulations the generated geometry with the mesh schematic is depicted in fig 2 in order to solve the developed equations two boundary conditions and an initial condition are required it should be noted that this equation was solved for two different inner boundary conditions including constant discharge rate and constant pressure moreover rock and fluid properties are among the other required parameters for numerical simulations although actual values were assigned for the synthetic numerical simulations all the generated results are presented in the dimensionless format using the proposed dimensionless parameters presented in the analytical modeling section 3 results and discussion in this section the results of the derived equations for both constant rate and constant pressure cases were verified through comparison with the results of the numerical simulations using cfd besides the generated pressure responses for our solutions were compared with the corresponding solutions of the pressure independent models to demonstrate the error generated due to neglecting the pressure dependency of the petrophysical properties 3 1 constant rate case in this part the accuracy of the analytical solution presented in sections 2 1 1 and 2 1 2 and the impacts of the pressure dependency parameter on the pressure drop across the system are investigated in fig 3 the dimensionless pressure drop is plotted against dimensionless time for different values of αd it should be noted that in this figure it was assumed that α β n 1 obviously when αd is small it matches the independent case because small values of αd mean there is no significant pressure dependency in the system and the model is almost equivalent to the pressure independent solution it should be noted that there is an inverse relationship between td and ct eq 42a as depicted in fig 3 there is an excellent agreement between our analytical solutions and the developed fem numerical scheme it goes without saying that total compressibility ct is the summation of rock compressibility cr and fluid compressibility cf it was proved that rock compressibility is the pressure dependency parameter appendix a fig 3 depicts dimensionless pressure versus dimensionless time for n 1 n is the permeability multiplier mentioned in eq 1c this scenario was repeated for different values of n it was proved that n 1 is not the best solution for real field cases therefore dimensionless pressure versus dimensionless time was plotted for n mckee et al 1988a ren and guo 2014 cappa et al 2018 jones 1975 in fig 4 it proves that a higher magnitude of n causes severe permeability reduction due to pressure drop therefore a more significant pressure drop can be observed within the system fig 4 demonstrated the effects of the permeability multiplier on pressure drop deviations from the pressure independent case can be seen in this plot in some applications e g well testing particular derivative plots are used for diagnostic purposes and calculating reservoir parameters stewart 2011 the concept of linear derivative d p d d p d d t was used to produce a flat line in the transient flow regime in the case of pressure independent permeability and before reaching the reservoir boundary a flat line should be observed in this derivative plot in fig 5 the pressure derivative was plotted versus dimensionless time sensitivity analysis of parameter αd shows that in the early time region td 0 1 pressure dependent cases match the independent one because pressure drop is not significant see fig 3 as well and permeability remains almost the same in all the different cases despite the pressure drop the wellbore pressure drops more with time and two different responses are observed for the pressure independent case a decrease in the pressure does not change the petrophysical properties of the reservoir therefore the linear trend for the pressure derivative is still observed strictly speaking the reservoir transfers its fluid to the wellbore with the same conductivity as before on the other hand in the pressure dependent cases decreasing the pressure of the reservoir results in more pressure drop because the capability of the reservoir to convey the fluid to the well is decreased as a result the pressure derivative increases for the pressure dependent cases and a hump is generated increasing the αd parameters results in increasing the height of the generated hump afterward the boundary dominated region arrives at td 0 5 when pressure derivative drops for all the cases with a constant slope ultimately the pressure dependency of the rock properties influences the derivative plot in the transient regions 3 2 constant pressure case in this part the accuracy of the analytical solution for the constant pressure inner boundary condition has been verified by comparing the generated results with the developed numerical scheme the dimensionless pressure drop has been generated as a function of td for various values of xd i e distances from the well in fig 6 dimensionless pressure was plotted against dimensionless time at xd 0 5 for both derived analytical solutions and the numerical scheme an excellent agreement between analytical and numerical solutions was observed in fig 6 for this figure a quantitative comparison is also conducted and acceptable results are obtained rmse 0 0006 r2 0 9998 the zero value for dimensionless pressure means p pi and higher values of pd indicate higher pressure drops as evidenced by fig 7 near wellbore locations smaller value of xd experienced more pressure drop and locations far from the wellbore larger value of xd did not face considerable pressure drop the results of analytical derivation for a specific case i e α β are compared with the developed numerical scheme using cfd methods the presented results verified the accuracy of our developed numerical model in the following figures the effects of different magnitudes of α and β are investigated in detail fig 8 depicts the impacts of permeability multiplier on dimensionless pressure at xd 0 5 and α 1e 5 1 psi increasing n leads to a severe permeability reduction fig 8 is compatible with the physics of the problem because the higher magnitude of n brings about a more significant permeability reduction which reduces the pressure propagation within the system therefore the cases with a higher magnitude of n experience lower pressure drop 4 conclusions in this study a new analytical solution for the fluid flow in pressure dependent porous media is proposed the derived equations are applicable to constant rate and constant pressure inner boundary conditions of the well making our equations appropriate for both well testing and decline curve analysis it should be noted that such an analytical solution in the time domain for deformable porous media is missing from the literature and the results of this study can be used as the verification solution of upcoming research studies the proposed analytical solution in this study could provide a valuable basis for future studies where additional complexities could be imposed on fluid flow modeling in porous media computational fluid dynamics cfd methods were also used to check the accuracy of the newly derived equations the derived equations were non dimensionalized and plotted for comparison purposes the linear derivative plot showed that pressure dependency of the petrophysical rock properties affects both the transient flow region and the boundary dominated flow it causes a hump in the transient region while shifting the lines in the steady state region comparing our solutions with the previously pressure independent solution it was found that neglecting pressure dependency might lead to approximately 40 error in the calculated pressure which could significantly influence reservoir management in pressure sensitive porous media given the high accuracy of the derived theoretical models a quantitative comparison is conducted and acceptable with rmse 0 0006 and r2 0 9998 they are applicable to fractured reservoirs deformable porous media such as coal bed methane reservoirs porous materials and tight shale gas reservoirs where hydraulic fractures are responsible for the fluid flow it should be noted that the developed numerical scheme can be used to investigate unconventional reservoirs with complicated functions for porosity and permeability however the scalability of the numerical methods is another issue that justifies the employment of analytical approaches the fast and accurate analytical

11799,fluid flow modeling in porous media requires solving relevant governing equations which are inherently nonlinear however some simplifications are usually made to make them linear one of those common assumptions is invariant rock properties with respect to reservoir pressure however there are some situations including pressure dependent porous media where this assumption would not be applicable hence the solution of the nonlinear diffusivity equation shall be sought for such cases the main goal of this study is to present a new analytical solution to the diffusivity equation and a numerical scheme considering exponential decreases in the petrophysical properties with reservoir pressure the diffusivity equation was solved using the assumed exponential functions and analytical solutions are provided in this paper besides computational fluid dynamics methods were utilized to verify the accuracy of the derived equations the developed analytical equations and numerical scheme were then applied over several pressure dependent porous media cases and our comparison study showed that neglecting the pressure dependency of the petrophysical properties will lead to significant errors approximately 40 based on the introduced solutions we also proposed a new set of type curves that can be used in well testing analyses of the deformable porous media graphical abstract image 1 keywords pressure dependent porous media computational fluid dynamics cfd diffusivity equation well testing type curves 1 introduction to fulfill the increased demand for energy it is crucial to envision the production of hydrocarbons from unconventional reservoirs production from these reservoirs is usually a challenging and costly task to overcome these challenges a comprehensive analysis is required usually we deal with high pressure underground reservoirs in which a considerable pressure drop occurs during its production phase since geomechanics proved that petrophysical properties are pressure dependent due to the compressibility hall 1953 these properties must be considered as a function of pressure in general mckee et al 1988a depletion of reservoirs with time increases the overburden pressure and causes pores closure leading to permeability and porosity reduction ren and guo 2014 it is assumed that early pressure drop at the wellbore in some cases is related to this permeability reduction due to pressure drop likewise fluid injection also alters the permeability and porosity of the reservoir cappa et al 2018 the magnitude of the pressure dependency of the formation is related to the formation compressibility parameter fractured reservoirs including unconventional naturally fractured reservoirs coal bed methane reservoirs and tight shale gas reservoirs with hydraulic fractures play a major role in petroleum engineering since many of the remaining hydrocarbon reserves are trapped in these reservoirs fractured reservoirs consist of two different systems namely matrices and fractures numerous laboratory experiments were conducted to evaluate the effect of pressure on petrophysical properties results of laboratory measurements for fracture medium express that petrophysical properties for fractures cannot be assumed constant since porosity and permeability are strongly pressure dependent jones 1975 walsh 1981 dong et al 2010 david et al 1994a brace et al 1968 wibberley 2002 ghabezloo et al 2009a wang et al 2018 this pressure dependency also exists in matrix media but it is not considerable however this pressure dependency is more severe in fracture media so it must be considered aguilera 2006 therefore it is assumed that the petrophysical properties of the matrix remain almost invariant with respect to pressure while fracture properties such as its porosity and permeability which are functions of fracture s opening considerably change with the changes in the reservoir pressure therefore the solution of the linearized diffusivity equation with no pressure dependency in the petrophysical properties might lead to erroneous predictions of the dynamic behavior of the porous system leading to fallacious management studies of the fractured reservoir therefore a new solution to the diffusivity equation is needed for accurate predictions of the flow and pressure within the fracture medium it should be noted that this is not limited to energy production from hydrocarbon reservoirs energy production is not the only issue and there are several other problems associated with material casting and environmental concerns that require additional attention giwa et al 2021 coppola et al 2021 gaudio et al 2021 several authors have tried to address the pressure dependency of the reservoir parameters in the diffusivity equation vairogs et al 1971 assumed stress dependent permeability and proposed a mathematical model for gas flow in tight gas reservoirs they showed that permeability reduction significantly affects the production from the reservoir raghavan et al 1972 presented a numerical method to investigate the impact of pressure dependent rock and fluid properties on the well flow test the effect of pressure dependent permeability on gas production and well testing analysis was studied by ostensen 1986 as well settari and mourits 1994 suggested considering a three dimensional stress field and then coupled their model with a reservoir simulator to obtain an accurate solution for the pressure dependent reservoirs instead some researchers kikani and pedrosa 1991 palmer and mansoori 1996 have assumed petrophysical properties as a function of pressure rather than the full stress tensor those researchers acclaimed that the error generated by this assumption is acceptable wu and pruess 2000 proposed a semi analytical solution to characterize the transient flow within the porous medium assuming pressure dependent permeability lo et al 2002 investigated fluid flow in deformable porous media assuming rock as an elastic solid raghavan and chin 2002 introduced a correlation to evaluate productivity losses due to stress dependent permeability an analytical model for pressure dependent permeability was proposed by shi and durucan 2004 they verified the proposed model by data from coal bed fields similar to the previous studies permeability reduction due to the increases in the confining pressure was observed yin et al 2007 studied the impact of pressure on poroelastic reservoirs and showed that it has a significant effect and should be considered for well testing analysis liu et al and wang et al wang et al 2016a liu et al 2010 conducted experiments to investigate the impact of compaction on fluid flow in fractures they found a negative exponential relationship between confining pressure and permeability the effects of permeability reduction on the loss of productivity was studied by clarkson et al 2013 the concept of pressure dependent permeability in tight gas reservoirs was applied to naturally fractured reservoirs by qanbari and clarkson 2013 cho et al 2013 investigated the effect of pressure dependent natural fracture permeability on production from shale gas wells in a theoretical study chen et al 2015 presented a correlation between fracture permeability and effective stress for shale gas reservoirs in addition they also studied the dependency of fracture compressibility on shale gas properties an experiment was conducted by huo and benson 2016 to investigate the stress dependency of relative permeability in fractures they demonstrated that relative permeability curves shift quickly from one model to another abbasi et al 2017 focused on another simplifying assumption of the diffusivity equation to analyze fluid flow in fractures taking into account the nonlinear quadratic pressure gradient tabatabaie et al 2017 presented a fluid flow equation in a pressure sensitive formation with pressure dependent permeability in 1d flow they stated that the linear flow in fractures should be considered for analyzing tight fractured formations analytical fluid flow modeling in porous media in the open literature is not limited to linear 1d flow nabizadeh et al 2020 proposed an analytical solution for spherical fluid flow modeling through porous media with non uniform initial pressure conditions an extensive microscale experiment was conducted by arshadi et al 2017 to analyze the impact of deformation on fluid flow through fractured samples they observed a significant permeability reduction due to confining pressure increment proving that the fracture medium is strongly pressure dependent liu et al 2018 studied the impact of shear stress on fracture network permeability and its effect on fluid flow they showed that this effect is not negligible and plays a decisive role apart from analytical and semi analytical studies for fluid flow modeling through porous media there are several numerical approaches like the monte carlo method curcio et al 2018 petrosino et al 2019 2020 the lattice boltzmann method lbm zhao et al 2020 wang et al 2016b boek and venturoli 2010 and direct numerical simulation dns adibifard et al 2020 nabizadeh et al 2019 although these numerical methods are associated with numerical errors they could provide a deep understanding of multi scale fluid flow in complex porous systems where analytical and semi analytical results are inapplicable although numerous research studies have been devoted to developing numerical or semi analytical solutions for reservoirs with stress dependent permeability an analytical solution in the time domain while both pressure dependent permeability and porosity are considered is usually ignored several references are cited within the manuscript which utilized complex nonlinear functions for permeability and porosity the significance of the presented methodology is providing an analytical solution considering nonlinear exponential permeability and porosity functions solved in the time domain the provided model can be used not only to characterize pressure dependent reservoirs but also to verify numerical studies with complex functions where an analytical solution is impossible therefore this study aims to introduce a new exact analytical solution by assuming the pressure dependency of permeability and porosity and a numerical scheme to model deformable porous media in the following section the corresponding partial differential equation pde is solved analytically and numerically for constant rate and constant pressure inner boundary conditions at the wellbore subsequently the veracity of the developed equations has been verified using the developed numerical scheme several issues justify the application of the proposed analytical solution rather than numerical methods first and foremost the accuracy of analytical solutions is not comparable to numerical methods especially for practical applications where the pressure drop magnitude is comparatively high e g near wellbore condition and flow through fracture indeed simplifications assumptions and numerical discretizations are associated with numerical modeling while those simplifying assumptions are eliminated from the analytical solutions moreover the scalability of the numerical methods is another issue that justifies the employment of analytical approaches these fast and accurate methodologies apply to real scale scenarios without frustration while numerical methods are computationally demanding and might be impossible under particular circumstances finally the proposed analytical solution in this study could provide a valuable basis for future studies where additional complexities could be imposed on the system commercial software packages e g well test analysis packages use analytical equations for modeling this study s generalized analytical solution is a step toward accurate analysis of more complicated and realistic scenarios 2 mathematical modeling researchers presented different correlations to consider porosity and permeability as functions of pressure in one of the studies in this field chen et al 2015 established a correlation between fracture permeability and reservoir pressure in their correlation they assumed an exponential relationship between permeability and pressure the exponential function of pressure was proposed by other researchers too dong et al 2010 wu and pruess 2000 wang et al 2016a liu et al 2009 2010 chen and li 2008 xiao et al 2009 it should be noted that the pressure dependency of permeability is higher than the porosity based on previous studies in this field pressure dependency functions in this study were defined as 1a k p k 0 e β p p i 1b φ p φ 0 e α p p i 1c k k 0 φ φ 0 n eq 1c is somehow originated from the carman kozeny equation in which the relationship between permeability and porosity is described by k φ 3 1 φ 2 gu and chalaturnyk 2006 hommel et al 2018 mckee et al 1988b in low porosity less than 1 formations the permeability porosity relation can be expressed as k φ 3 in which the permeability multiplier is considered 3 by the original carman kozeny equation gu and chalaturnyk 2006 hommel et al 2018 mckee et al 1988b however this exponent could not satisfy the permeability porosity variations for all types of formations with different characteristics david et al 1994b raghavan and chin 2004 instead a general power law relationship between permeability and porosity is defined with a variable permeability multiplier eq 1c used in several studies chin et al 1998 ghabezloo et al 2009b pang et al 2016 jun jia et al 2017 kozhevnikov et al 2021 to predict permeability variation the permeability multiplier n is defined as a fitting parameter with a particular value for specific rock types and is commonly obtained via fitting experimental data hommel et al 2018 jun jia et al 2017 nevertheless more than a fitting parameter the permeability multiplier physically relates to changes in pore geometry that occurred during the evolving processes mineral dissolution mineral precipitation chemical alteration stress dependency and in general all procedures that affect the pore structure of a specific formation bernab 2003 luquot et al 2014 carroll et al 2013 garing et al 2015 are among those processes for better illustrations we assumed initial values of 100 md and 0 2 for permeability and porosity respectively and they were calculated as functions of pressure the results are plotted in fig 1 for permeability and porosity as functions of pressure assuming different values of α and β clearly the order of pressure dependency is proportional to the formation s compressibility higher values of rock s compressibility lead to more pressure dependency in our equations α is a representative of the rock compressibility cr and we assume it is constant in our equations appendix a ahmed and mckinney stewart ahmed and mckinney 2011 stewart 2011 proposed the diffusivity equation for modeling fluid flow in porous media assuming the pressure dependency of the porosity and permeability the diffusivity

numerical modelling using finite element method fem in this section governing equations regarding single phase fluid flow in porous media are derived developed equations are discretized and solved by finite element methods and their results are compared with the analytical solution 2 3 1 governing equations darcy s law and the continuity equation are necessary to describe fluid flow through porous media in this case the pressure gradient is the driving force for the fluid flow therefore the continuity equation and the general darcy s law for single phase flow are 60a u k μ p ρ g 60b t ρ φ ρ u q

bathe 2006 reddy 2004 the abovementioned nonlinear pde is discretized and transformed into a weak formulation according to the galerkin finite element method and the quadratic basis functions were used to approximate the dependent variable i e pressure hutton 2004 2 3 2 geometry boundary conditions and meshing the geometry intended for solving the equation is a rectangular channel the mapped mesh method is used with quad elements for mesh generation to evaluate the quality of the generated mesh a mesh convergence analysis was performed using five different meshes with 9856 22029 36396 58975 and 268176 quad elements after comparing the results of these different meshes the mesh with 36396 quad elements was selected for the rest of the numerical simulations obtained pressure drop values from the simulations are considered as a measure to select an appropriate mesh scenario the results of the mesh sensitivity analysis are reported in table 1 after comparing the results of these different meshes the mesh with 36396 quad elements with appropriate accuracy and the computational cost was selected for the rest of the numerical simulations the generated geometry with the mesh schematic is depicted in fig 2 in order to solve the developed equations two boundary conditions and an initial condition are required it should be noted that this equation was solved for two different inner boundary conditions including constant discharge rate and constant pressure moreover rock and fluid properties are among the other required parameters for numerical simulations although actual values were assigned for the synthetic numerical simulations all the generated results are presented in the dimensionless format using the proposed dimensionless parameters presented in the analytical modeling section 3 results and discussion in this section the results of the derived equations for both constant rate and constant pressure cases were verified through comparison with the results of the numerical simulations using cfd besides the generated pressure responses for our solutions were compared with the corresponding solutions of the pressure independent models to demonstrate the error generated due to neglecting the pressure dependency of the petrophysical properties 3 1 constant rate case in this part the accuracy of the analytical solution presented in sections 2 1 1 and 2 1 2 and the impacts of the pressure dependency parameter on the pressure drop across the system are investigated in fig 3 the dimensionless pressure drop is plotted against dimensionless time for different values of αd it should be noted that in this figure it was assumed that α β n 1 obviously when αd is small it matches the independent case because small values of αd mean there is no significant pressure dependency in the system and the model is almost equivalent to the pressure independent solution it should be noted that there is an inverse relationship between td and ct eq 42a as depicted in fig 3 there is an excellent agreement between our analytical solutions and the developed fem numerical scheme it goes without saying that total compressibility ct is the summation of rock compressibility cr and fluid compressibility cf it was proved that rock compressibility is the pressure dependency parameter appendix a fig 3 depicts dimensionless pressure versus dimensionless time for n 1 n is the permeability multiplier mentioned in eq 1c this scenario was repeated for different values of n it was proved that n 1 is not the best solution for real field cases therefore dimensionless pressure versus dimensionless time was plotted for n mckee et al 1988a ren and guo 2014 cappa et al 2018 jones 1975 in fig 4 it proves that a higher magnitude of n causes severe permeability reduction due to pressure drop therefore a more significant pressure drop can be observed within the system fig 4 demonstrated the effects of the permeability multiplier on pressure drop deviations from the pressure independent case can be seen in this plot in some applications e g well testing particular derivative plots are used for diagnostic purposes and calculating reservoir parameters stewart 2011 the concept of linear derivative d p d d p d d t was used to produce a flat line in the transient flow regime in the case of pressure independent permeability and before reaching the reservoir boundary a flat line should be observed in this derivative plot in fig 5 the pressure derivative was plotted versus dimensionless time sensitivity analysis of parameter αd shows that in the early time region td 0 1 pressure dependent cases match the independent one because pressure drop is not significant see fig 3 as well and permeability remains almost the same in all the different cases despite the pressure drop the wellbore pressure drops more with time and two different responses are observed for the pressure independent case a decrease in the pressure does not change the petrophysical properties of the reservoir therefore the linear trend for the pressure derivative is still observed strictly speaking the reservoir transfers its fluid to the wellbore with the same conductivity as before on the other hand in the pressure dependent cases decreasing the pressure of the reservoir results in more pressure drop because the capability of the reservoir to convey the fluid to the well is decreased as a result the pressure derivative increases for the pressure dependent cases and a hump is generated increasing the αd parameters results in increasing the height of the generated hump afterward the boundary dominated region arrives at td 0 5 when pressure derivative drops for all the cases with a constant slope ultimately the pressure dependency of the rock properties influences the derivative plot in the transient regions 3 2 constant pressure case in this part the accuracy of the analytical solution for the constant pressure inner boundary condition has been verified by comparing the generated results with the developed numerical scheme the dimensionless pressure drop has been generated as a function of td for various values of xd i e distances from the well in fig 6 dimensionless pressure was plotted against dimensionless time at xd 0 5 for both derived analytical solutions and the numerical scheme an excellent agreement between analytical and numerical solutions was observed in fig 6 for this figure a quantitative comparison is also conducted and acceptable results are obtained rmse 0 0006 r2 0 9998 the zero value for dimensionless pressure means p pi and higher values of pd indicate higher pressure drops as evidenced by fig 7 near wellbore locations smaller value of xd experienced more pressure drop and locations far from the wellbore larger value of xd did not face considerable pressure drop the results of analytical derivation for a specific case i e α β are compared with the developed numerical scheme using cfd methods the presented results verified the accuracy of our developed numerical model in the following figures the effects of different magnitudes of α and β are investigated in detail fig 8 depicts the impacts of permeability multiplier on dimensionless pressure at xd 0 5 and α 1e 5 1 psi increasing n leads to a severe permeability reduction fig 8 is compatible with the physics of the problem because the higher magnitude of n brings about a more significant permeability reduction which reduces the pressure propagation within the system therefore the cases with a higher magnitude of n experience lower pressure drop 4 conclusions in this study a new analytical solution for the fluid flow in pressure dependent porous media is proposed the derived equations are applicable to constant rate and constant pressure inner boundary conditions of the well making our equations appropriate for both well testing and decline curve analysis it should be noted that such an analytical solution in the time domain for deformable porous media is missing from the literature and the results of this study can be used as the verification solution of upcoming research studies the proposed analytical solution in this study could provide a valuable basis for future studies where additional complexities could be imposed on fluid flow modeling in porous media computational fluid dynamics cfd methods were also used to check the accuracy of the newly derived equations the derived equations were non dimensionalized and plotted for comparison purposes the linear derivative plot showed that pressure dependency of the petrophysical rock properties affects both the transient flow region and the boundary dominated flow it causes a hump in the transient region while shifting the lines in the steady state region comparing our solutions with the previously pressure independent solution it was found that neglecting pressure dependency might lead to approximately 40 error in the calculated pressure which could significantly influence reservoir management in pressure sensitive porous media given the high accuracy of the derived theoretical models a quantitative comparison is conducted and acceptable with rmse 0 0006 and r2 0 9998 they are applicable to fractured reservoirs deformable porous media such as coal bed methane reservoirs porous materials and tight shale gas reservoirs where hydraulic fractures are responsible for the fluid flow it should be noted that the developed numerical scheme can be used to investigate unconventional reservoirs with complicated functions for porosity and permeability however the scalability of the numerical methods is another issue that justifies the employment of analytical approaches the fast and accurate analytical methodology applies to real scale scenarios without frustrations while numerical methods are computationally demanding declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known
