13630,extracellular polymeric substances eps released by bacteria play a crucial role in microbial aggregation during wastewater treatment various environmental factors including substrate anaerobic and aerobic conditions might contribute to the formation and properties of eps and thereby affect the properties of microbial aggregation and sludge to reveal the relationship between these environmental factors and eps properties the characteristics of eps generated in four types of sludge were investigated including anammox granular sludge anmx aerobic granular sludge ags fed with glucose as carbon source ags gluc ags fed with liquor wastewater as carbon source ags liq and flocculent sludge from a real sewage plant floc results indicated a positive correlation of eps contents with granulation of sludge as the dominant content of eps an increased proteins pn concentration facilitated the formation of microbial aggregates and the granulation of sludge bacteria in anaerobic environment i e anmx or in aerobic environment with easily biodegradable carbon sources i e ags gluc would generate more pn and eps yet these conditions restrained the generation of humic acid ha the sludge from the sewage treatment plant i e floc had the lowest eps and pn content but the highest ha showing flocculent structure sludge in addition a higher protein polysaccharide pn ps ratio and a lower zeta potential of eps were conductive to sludge granulation the hydrophobicity of eps confirmed via analysis of chemical structures by ftir would improve the microbial aggregation keywords extracellular polymeric substances eps eps composition sludge granulation pn ps ratio substrates 1 introduction it is well known that extracellular polymeric substances eps released by bacteria exist as the skeleton of microbial aggregates and these microbial aggregates such as biofilms and sludge flocs play a critical role during wastewater treatment 1 eps can be treated as biopolymers 2 and the composition includes protein pn polysaccharide ps nucleic acid and humic acid ha 3 6 the matrix of eps is important in the properties of microbial aggregates and sludge including the flocculation ability settleability surface properties dewaterability and adsorption ability 7 8 failed or weak microbial aggregation has been observed caused by inefficient eps synthesis in a previous study 9 besides physicochemical function on microbial aggregates and sludge eps also participates in microbial metabolism as an extracellular electron receptor and protects microbe against harsh environmental conditions e g heavy metals toxic compounds 10 extensive studies have focused on the component content surface property and the functional groups of eps and eps extraction methods as reported the extraction approaches of eps from sludge e g heating edta method centrifugation ultrasound method cation exchange resin 11 12 may cause obvious differences of eps components and contents however more importantly eps produced from microbial metabolism is inevitably sensitive to the operational and environmental conditions 7 these conditions may influence the composition structure and properties of eps and then influence the characteristics of microbial aggregation and sludge substrate is the energy source of microorganism the influence of which on the metabolic way and microbial community cannot be neglected and it is related to the production of eps comparing with sludge fed with glucose sludge fed with starch has been reported a higher ps concentration in eps 13 and as an adhesive ps has a positive effect on maintaining sludge particle stability 4 14 furthermore pn content in eps significantly raised in sludge fed with pn of an increasing polymerization degree 8 and pn usually contributes to the microorganism accumulation as the main compositions of eps pn and ps both have influence on sludge granulation due to the eps properties caused by them e g the surface charge hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity 4 7 14 15 in addition the microorganism composition of sludge also has influence on the eps for example anammox sludge with different microbial communities under the strict anaerobic condition had more eps than aerobic sludge 16 for heterotrophic ags pn content is higher than ps content while nitrification autotrophic ags shows a contrary result 17 18 the energy level of microbial metabolism also has an influence on the eps properties considering the generation ways of eps for the sludge taken from wastewater treatment plants wwtp ha eps ratio is up to 30 6 higher than that from other types of sludge around 10 3 19 20 with this regard a comprehensive study of eps in different types of sludge is necessary different carbon sources and oxygen conditions may affect the composition of eps such as pn ps and ha and furthermore may affect the structure of sludge in order to investigate the characteristic difference of eps extracted from varied sludge caused by bioreactor operating conditions or environmental conditions various types of sludge were investigated in this study which were cultured under different carbon sources and with or without oxygen conditions including anammox granular sludge fed with inorganic substrates anmx aerobic granular sludge fed with glucose as carbon source ags gluc aerobic granular sludge fed with liquor wastewater as carbon source ags liq and the flocculent sludge from a real sewage treatment plant floc combined with sludge characteristics and operating conditions the morphology composition zeta potential and chemical structure of eps were studied the research objectives were to reveal the relationship between the eps properties and carbon sources or oxygen conditions and to investigate the sludge difference caused by eps properties 2 materials and methods 2 1 sludge collection three types of sludge including anmx ags gluc and ags liq were separately cultured in three sequencing batch reactors

33 mg l correspondingly the external and internal return activated sludge were 70 and 200 respectively the effluent cod tp tn and nh4 n were below 60 1 20 and 5 mg l respectively the optical microscopy sunny ex20 china was employed to observe the morphology of sludge mlss and mlvss were analyzed in accordance with the standard method 21 2 2 eps extraction eps was extracted from sludge samples with a modified thermal extraction approach 15 firstly the concentration of mlss was diluted to 2000 3000 mg l then 30 ml sludge sample was washed for 3 times with deionized water heated 80 c 30 min centrifuged and filtered followed by the literature method 20 finally the crude 20 ml eps solution was prepared for analysis 2 3 analysis of eps property eps properties were investigated via analysis of its composition morphology electrical property and chemical structure protein pn polysaccharide ps and humic acid ha were selected as the main examined components of eps their concentrations were determined by a uv vis spectrophotometer loobo uv752 china according to the folin method with bovine serum albumin as the standard the anthrone method with glucose as the standard and the folin method with ha as the standard respectively 20 in order to preserve the nature eps form the extracted 1 ml eps was diluted to 5 ml with ultrapure water and then 10 μl eps solution was transferred to the copper grids after the solution was dried it was observed by the transmission electron microscopy tem jeol jem 1400plus japan at a voltage of 120 kv in order to investigate the electrical property the ph value of eps solution was first adjusted to 7 0 and then was measured by the electrophoresis instrument powereach js94h china the ph meter rex phs 3c china was used to adjust ph value of eps for zeta potential measurement eps solution was transferred to a petri dish and then frozen in a refrigerator at 20 c after the liquid eps was frozen solid eps was subsequently lyophilized by a vacuum freeze dryer foring lgj 12 china at 58 c for 24 h the powdery eps was mixed with kbr at the ratio of 1 100 and then compressed using a tablet press finally the sample was scanned by a fourier transform infrared spectrometer ftir thermo fisher nicolet is5 usa in the range of 4000 500 cm 1 2 4 statistical analysis all the data were arithmetic means of measurements of three parallel samples analyzed by the software of the statistical product and service solutions spss the statistical relative error was below 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 morphological characteristics 3 1 1 morphology of sludge fig 1 shows the morphologies of four types of sludge collected from three lab scale bioreactors and a real wastewater treatment plant observed using the optical microscope from these photos significant differences in shape size and structure were observed for varied types of sludge anmx ags gluc and ags liq all showed obvious big granular particles while floc showed typical flocculated particles the sludge particles from anmx displayed clear and smooth boundary with uniform particle diameters of over 1 mm the sludge particles of ags gluc and ags liq both showed unclear and rough boundary and some particles were entangled or linked by filaments ags gluc and ags liq both had large range of particle size distributions with average particle sizes of 233 μm and 900 μm respectively in addition an increasing unclear degree of the particle boundary was observed with the decrease of particle size until the boundary disappeared and became flocculated sludge compared with granular particles from the other three types of sludge floc was typical flocculent sludge with thin irregular and loose structures furthermore the color of various types of sludge was also different anmx was observed visibly as reddish brown ags gluc showed yellow or white ags liq was yellow and floc showed brown color the markedly different colors of sludge might be attributed to the microbial composition and operating conditions because of the similarity and also the difference in form edge dense degree size and color the selection of these above sludge samples implied broadly representative 3 1 2 morphology of eps extracted from various types of sludge fig 2 shows the tem images of eps extracted from the above four types of sludge from these images the morphologies of eps from various sludge showed marked differences eps from anmx and floc obviously appeared as gel like structures shown in fig 2a and d mccutcheon and southam 22 observed similar appearance of eps the eps shown in fig 2a anmx was observed as irregular and uneven thick shape while those in ags gluc and ags liq showed dendritic and sheet structures respectively the stick shaped substances in the thin part of fig 2b and c were reported as ps according to the research results of andrade et al 23 in fig 2b there were obviously a large number of small sparkling bubbles which was possibly attributed to the strong electric waves emitted to disperse the organic substances by tem in fig 2d a thin layer of irregular morphology with a little of sparse dark dots which looked like a loose flocculent sludge was observed the eps changed visibly from dark to light in color and also decreased in the thickness in the order of anmx ags gluc ags liq and floc the dark and thick morphology of eps in the tem images might be due to the macromolecular aggregates composed of pn and ps 24 since pn and ps are the main components of eps 8 25 the eps increases with the increase of dark and thick matter in vision of tem 3 2 comparison of eps components in the four types of sludge concentrations of protein pn polysaccharide ps and humic acid ha in eps of the four types of sludge are shown in fig 3 the calculated concentrations of eps based on the three main components from anmx to floc were 249 21 238 88 219 23 and 209 93 mg g mlvss with the same order as the concentration of pn from the figure the pn concentration in eps of anmx ags gluc ags liq and floc were 175 09 149 06 105 47 and 86 18 mg g mlvss correspondingly pn content was prominently higher than either ps or ha content in all of these sludge the result is in consistent with the findings of previous researchers 14 16 ps showed the second high concentration in eps except for floc where the concentration of ha 69 05 mg g mlvss was higher than ps 54 70 mg g mlvss compared with fig 1 pn content of anmx and ags gluc with obvious granules was prominently higher than that of ags liq and floc indicating that the concentration of pn increased with the increase of sludge granulation the concentrations of pn also implied anaerobic condition of sludge facilitated the generation of pn comparing with aerobic sludge it might attribute to a large number of hydrophobic amino acids and pn extensively distributing in the anaerobic ammonia oxidation sludge and a high pn content promoted the aggregation of anaerobic sludge 16 24 26 for anaerobic sludge pn close to the cells improved the strength and intensity of anmx according to the reported conclusion of lin and wang 24 the difference of pn content was possibly related to the pn participation in the synthesis of extracellular enzymes which connected with carbon source of microorganism 25 furthermore an easily biodegradable organic substrate was conducive to the expression of biological activity which would contribute to producing more extracellular enzymes and pn 27 in this study glucose was easier to be absorbed and utilized by microorganisms than the liquor wastewater and domestic sewage due to its simple composition the liquor wastewater as a compound of alcohols organic acids esters and reducing sugars et al contained some refractory macromolecular organic matters this illustrated that pn played an important role in granule formation as well as stability and the degradation degree of carbon source was an important factor polysaccharide ps as a hydrophilic matter was another important composition of eps 26 from fig 3 ps content was apparently lower than pn in eps ps content of anmx was the lowest while that of ags gluc was the highest among four kinds of sludge in anaerobic process the low energy level would restrain energy to store in the form of ps which resulted in the low level of ps content in eps compared with the glucose carbon source the liquor wastewater with a variety of sugars and acids would be easy to utilize to produce excess energy and to store in ps the conclusion is similar to the findings of geyik et al 28 glucose was easy to participate in the synthesis of ps a dendritic shaped substance shown in fig 2b was regarded as a typical ps which would be contribute to high ps content 28 29 sewage wastewater with a little of sugar and a large number of un degraded organic matters would produce a low amount of ps previous reports have revealed that an organic carbon source with rich carbohydrate would be conductive to ps synthesis of eps 30 31 and these were adapted to the results of this study humic acid ha is regarded as a metabolite during the substrates hydrolysis process 32 from fig 3 floc showed the highest concentration of ha in eps among the four kinds of sludge up to 69 05 mg g mlvss possibly because the domestic sewage had the most complicated and refractory substrate composition however anmx 30 19 mg g mlvss and ags gluc 24 13 mg g mlvss had the similar lower ha concentration due to the simple composition of substrates previous studies reported that ha content in eps was positively correlated with the lipase activity and substrates 8 25 therefore the results implied that more intermediate products were generated during microbe metabolism process with the complexity of substrates increasing as mentioned above eps as a microbial metabolism product was inevitably influenced by environmental conditions which was consistent with previous research results 28 33 what s more carbon source components played a crucial role in the synthesis of pn ps and ha of eps 3 3 electrical and chemical properties of eps in four types of sludge 3 3 1 zeta potential and pn ps ratio of eps fig 4 shows the measured zeta potential and pn ps ratio of eps extracted from the four types of sludge as can be seen from fig 4 all the eps showed negative zeta potential values ags liq and floc had apparently higher absolute zeta potential values than the other two types of sludge indicating that the surfaces of anmx and ags gluc had fewer electronegative functional groups the absolute values of zeta potential had negative correlation with the pn ps ratio values i e the negative zeta potential increased with the decrease of pn ps ratio 34 as previous reported the range of pn ps ratio for ags was from 1 3 to 4 9 table s3 while the pn ps ratio of anmx was around 3 0 and even up to 12 14 table s4 the pn ps ratio of anaerobic sludge was higher than that of aerobic sludge which was consistent with our results comparing the results with those in figs 1 and 3 the lower absolute value of zeta potential corresponded to the higher eps content and the more complete granule which was consistent with the findings of li et al 35 generally pn is positively charged due to the hydrolysis of amino groups while the ps has negative charges because of the hydrolysis of hydroxyl groups 36 a higher pn ps ratio indicates a higher positive charge which can neutralize the negative charge of the eps thus the absolute zeta potential value can be reduced and furthermore microorganism would aggregate due to the decrease of repulsion among them it is inferred that a higher pn ps ratio and a lower zeta potential of eps were conductive to sludge granulation and they were regarded as an indicator for granule 3 3 2 ftir spectrum of eps in order to reveal the chemical structures of eps ftir was employed fig 5 shows the ftir spectra of eps from different sludge peaks at 1700 1600 cm 1 represented for the amide i 1600 1500 cm 1 was for the amide ii 1500 1300 cm 1 was for the carboxyl groups and hydrocarbons compounds 1300 1200 cm 1 was for the amide iii 1200 900 cm 1 was for the ps and nucleic acid and 900 600 cm 1 was for the fingerprint zone the functional groups of eps mainly located in the 1800 900 cm 1 region 36 37 the peaks ranged from 1640 to 1649 cm 1 represented co and cc stretching in pn 37 38 which was strongest in anmx the bands approximately at 1553 cm 1 was mainly assigned to nh bending in pn which were not obvious in all the sludge the bands at 1404 cm 1 were associated with the symmetric strengthening of co in coo group 26 which was almost invisible in anmx but obviously appeared in floc the stronger peak of co in coo group in floc than those in ags gluc and ags liq indicated the surface of flocculent sludge showed distinct hydrophilicity the results showed that more hydrophobic and fewer hydrophilic functional groups in the eps of anmx which gave a well explanation for granulation from the point of view of the chemical structure the peak at approximately 1276 cm 1 which was mainly assigned to cn bond extension and was related to the secondary amide of pn 39 was obvious in ags gluc but almost invisible in ags liq and floc that explained why ags gluc contained more pn than that in ags liq and floc fig 3 the group characteristics of eps were consistent with the earlier mentioned results and provided a further microcosmic explanation of granule formation overall the bands which indicated groups attributed to pn were most obvious in anmx followed by ags gluc and then ags liq and floc the ftir spectra results were consistent with the order of pn concentrations in the four types of sludge discussed in section 3 2 the difference in the chemical structure of eps also resulted in the corresponding difference of sludge morphology shown in fig 1 4 conclusions characteristics of eps generated by bacteria might be influenced by varied environmental factors and in turn affect the structure and properties of microbial aggregates and sludge the relationship between operating conditions or environment e g oxygen level and substrate and the characteristics of extracted eps from sludge was analyzed via investigation of four types of sludge results indicated a positive correlation of the concentration of eps and protein pn with granulation of sludge anaerobic environment and simple organic substrates facilitated the generation of eps and pn among the four types of sludge anmx generated the highest eps and pn concentrations as 249 21 and 175 09 mg g mlvss respectively which also showed the most obvious granulation yet the sludge from a real sewage treatment plant floc had the lowest eps and pn content 209 93 and 86 18 mg g mlvss correspondingly due to the complicated composition of substrates showing flocculent structure sludge in addition it was observed that eps generated in complicated substrates consisted of more humic acid polysaccharide ps content was associated with the energy level of microbial metabolism and the carbon composition the lower energy level and carbon source with fewer saccharides restrained the synthesis of ps a higher pn ps ratio and a lower zeta potential of eps were conductive to sludge granulation more hydrophobic groups cc and co and less hydrophilic groups co in coo in the eps extracted from anmx were confirmed via ftir indicating the hydrophobicity of eps would improve the microbe aggregation these findings can be applied to understand how and why eps has an influence on microbial aggregates declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

the morphologies of eps from various sludge showed marked differences eps from anmx and floc obviously appeared as gel like structures shown in fig 2a and d mccutcheon and southam 22 observed similar appearance of eps the eps shown in fig 2a anmx was observed as irregular and uneven thick shape while those in ags gluc and ags liq showed dendritic and sheet structures respectively the stick shaped substances in the thin part of fig 2b and c were reported as ps according to the research results of andrade et al 23 in fig 2b there were obviously a large number of small sparkling bubbles which was possibly attributed to the strong electric waves emitted to disperse the organic substances by tem in fig 2d a thin layer of irregular morphology with a little of sparse dark dots which looked like a loose flocculent sludge was observed the eps changed visibly from dark to light in color and also decreased in the thickness in the order of anmx ags gluc ags liq and floc the dark and thick morphology of eps in the tem images might be due to the macromolecular aggregates composed of pn and ps 24 since pn and ps are the main components of eps 8 25 the eps increases with the increase of dark and thick matter in vision of tem 3 2 comparison of eps components in the four types of sludge concentrations of protein pn polysaccharide ps and humic acid ha in eps of the four types of sludge are shown in fig 3 the calculated concentrations of eps based on the three main components from anmx to floc were 249 21 238 88 219 23 and 209 93 mg g mlvss with the same order as the concentration of pn from the figure the pn concentration in eps of anmx ags gluc ags liq and floc were 175 09 149 06 105 47 and 86 18 mg g mlvss correspondingly pn content was prominently higher than either ps or ha content in all of these sludge the result is in consistent with the findings of previous researchers 14 16 ps showed the second high concentration in eps except for floc where the concentration of ha 69 05 mg g mlvss was higher than ps 54 70 mg g mlvss compared with fig 1 pn content of anmx and ags gluc with obvious granules was prominently higher than that of ags liq and floc indicating that the concentration of pn increased with the increase of sludge granulation the concentrations of pn also implied anaerobic condition of sludge facilitated the generation of pn comparing with aerobic sludge it might attribute to a large number of hydrophobic amino acids and pn extensively distributing in the anaerobic ammonia oxidation sludge and a high pn content promoted the aggregation of anaerobic sludge 16 24 26 for anaerobic sludge pn close to the cells improved the strength and intensity of anmx according to the reported conclusion of lin and wang 24 the difference of pn content was possibly related to the pn participation in the synthesis of extracellular enzymes which connected with carbon source of microorganism 25 furthermore an easily biodegradable organic substrate was conducive to the expression of biological activity which would contribute to producing more extracellular enzymes and pn 27 in this study glucose was easier to be absorbed and utilized by microorganisms than the liquor wastewater and domestic sewage due to its simple composition the liquor wastewater as a compound of alcohols organic acids esters and reducing sugars et al contained some refractory macromolecular organic matters this illustrated that pn played an important role in granule formation as well as stability and the degradation degree of carbon source was an important factor polysaccharide ps as a hydrophilic matter was another important composition of eps 26 from fig 3 ps content was apparently lower than pn in eps ps content of anmx was the lowest while that of ags gluc was the highest among four kinds of sludge in anaerobic process the low energy level would restrain energy to store in the form of ps which resulted in the low level of ps content in eps compared with the glucose carbon source the liquor wastewater with a variety of sugars and acids would be easy to utilize to produce excess energy and to store in ps the conclusion is similar to the findings of geyik et al 28 glucose was easy to participate in the synthesis of ps a dendritic shaped substance shown in fig 2b was regarded as a typical ps which would be contribute to high ps content 28 29 sewage wastewater with a little of sugar and a large number of un degraded organic matters would produce a low amount of ps previous reports have revealed that an organic carbon source with rich carbohydrate would be conductive to ps synthesis of eps 30 31 and these were adapted to the results of this study humic acid ha is regarded as a metabolite during the substrates hydrolysis process 32 from fig 3 floc showed the highest concentration of ha in eps among the four kinds of sludge up to 69 05 mg g mlvss possibly because the domestic sewage had the most complicated and refractory substrate composition however anmx 30 19 mg g mlvss and ags gluc 24 13 mg g mlvss had the similar lower ha concentration due to the simple composition of substrates previous studies reported that ha content in eps was positively correlated with the lipase activity and substrates 8 25 therefore the results implied that more intermediate products were generated during microbe metabolism process with the complexity of substrates increasing as mentioned above eps as a microbial metabolism product was inevitably influenced by environmental conditions which was consistent with previous research results 28 33 what s more carbon source components played a crucial role in the synthesis of pn ps and ha of eps 3 3 electrical and chemical properties of eps in four types of sludge 3 3 1 zeta potential and pn ps ratio of eps fig 4 shows the measured zeta potential and pn ps ratio of eps extracted from the four types of sludge as can be seen from fig 4 all the eps showed negative zeta potential values ags liq and floc had apparently higher absolute zeta potential values than the other two types of sludge indicating that the surfaces of anmx and ags gluc had fewer electronegative functional groups the absolute values of zeta potential had negative correlation with the pn ps ratio values i e the negative zeta potential increased with the decrease of pn ps ratio 34 as previous reported the range of pn ps ratio for ags was from 1 3 to 4 9 table s3 while the pn ps ratio of anmx was around 3 0 and even up to 12 14 table s4 the pn ps ratio of anaerobic sludge was higher than that of aerobic sludge which was consistent with our results comparing the results with those in figs 1 and 3 the lower absolute value of zeta potential corresponded to the higher eps content and the more complete granule which was consistent with the findings of li et al 35 generally pn is positively charged due to the hydrolysis of amino groups while the ps has negative charges because of the hydrolysis of hydroxyl groups 36 a higher pn ps ratio indicates a higher positive charge which can neutralize the negative charge of the eps thus the absolute zeta potential value can be reduced and furthermore microorganism would aggregate due to the decrease of repulsion among them it is inferred that a higher pn ps ratio and a lower zeta potential of eps were conductive to sludge granulation and they were regarded as an indicator for granule 3 3 2 ftir spectrum of eps in order to reveal the chemical structures of eps ftir was employed fig 5 shows the ftir spectra of eps from different sludge peaks at 1700 1600 cm 1 represented for the amide i 1600 1500 cm 1 was for the amide ii 1500 1300 cm 1 was for the carboxyl groups and hydrocarbons compounds 1300 1200 cm 1 was for the amide iii 1200 900 cm 1 was for the ps and nucleic acid and 900 600 cm 1 was for the fingerprint zone the functional groups of eps mainly located in the 1800 900 cm 1 region 36 37 the peaks ranged from 1640 to 1649 cm 1 represented co and cc stretching in pn 37 38 which was strongest in anmx the bands approximately at 1553 cm 1 was mainly assigned to nh bending in pn which were not obvious in all the sludge the bands at 1404 cm 1 were associated with the symmetric strengthening of co in coo group 26 which was almost invisible in anmx but obviously appeared in floc the stronger peak of co in coo group in floc than those in ags gluc and ags liq indicated the surface of flocculent sludge showed distinct hydrophilicity the results showed that more hydrophobic and fewer hydrophilic functional groups in the eps of anmx which gave a well explanation for granulation from the point of view of the chemical structure the peak at approximately 1276 cm 1 which was mainly assigned to cn bond extension and was related to the secondary amide of pn 39 was obvious in ags gluc but almost invisible in ags liq and floc that explained why ags gluc contained more pn than that in ags liq and floc fig 3 the group characteristics of eps were consistent with the earlier mentioned results and provided a further microcosmic explanation of granule formation overall the bands which indicated groups attributed to pn were most obvious in anmx followed by ags gluc and then ags liq and floc the ftir spectra results were consistent with the order of pn concentrations in the four types of sludge discussed in section 3 2 the difference in the chemical structure of eps also resulted in the corresponding difference of sludge morphology shown in fig 1 4 conclusions characteristics of eps generated by bacteria might be influenced by varied environmental factors and in turn affect the structure and properties of microbial aggregates and sludge the relationship between operating conditions or environment e g oxygen level and substrate and the characteristics of extracted eps from sludge was analyzed via investigation of four types of sludge results indicated a positive correlation of the concentration of eps and protein pn with granulation of sludge anaerobic environment and simple organic substrates facilitated the generation of eps and pn among the four types of sludge anmx generated the highest eps and pn concentrations as 249 21 and 175 09 mg g mlvss respectively which also showed the most obvious granulation yet the sludge from a real sewage treatment plant floc had the lowest eps and pn content 209 93 and 86 18 mg g mlvss correspondingly due to the complicated composition of substrates showing flocculent structure sludge in addition it was observed that eps generated in complicated substrates consisted of more humic acid polysaccharide ps content was associated with the energy level of microbial metabolism and the carbon composition the lower energy level and carbon source with fewer saccharides restrained the synthesis of ps a higher pn ps ratio and a lower zeta potential of eps were conductive to sludge granulation more hydrophobic groups cc and co and less hydrophilic groups co in coo in the eps extracted from anmx were confirmed via ftir indicating the hydrophobicity of eps would improve the microbe aggregation these findings can be applied to understand how and why eps has an influence on microbial aggregates declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

13631,dissolved organic matter dom is the primary precursor that reacts with chlorine to form potentially carcinogenic mutagenic disinfection byproducts dbps the prime objective of this study was to compare the nature of dom in samples collected from drinking water and wastewater treatment plants in western india and to relate their nature and concentration to trihalomethane thm formation the effects of chlorine dose bromide ion contact time and ph on thm formation were also studied the surrogate parameters such as uv absorbance at 254 nm and dissolved organic carbon doc were monitored for each experiment to understand their correlation with thm formation in the selected water and wastewater systems fluorescence spectroscopy revealed that dom in wastewater was dominated by protein like components while dom in water samples consisted mostly of humic like components which exhibited greater thm formation potential fractionation of dom into various fractions followed by reaction with chlorine revealed that the hydrophobic acid and neutral fractions of dom were primarily responsible for thm formation thus methods that target removing these fractions before chlorination would have maximum impact on reducing thm formation keywords disinfection byproducts trihalomethanes trihalomethane formation potential natural organic matter dissolved organic matter total organic carbon 1 introduction disinfection is applied as a finishing step during water and wastewater treatment to inactivate pathogens 1 2 however the disinfection process leads to the formation of disinfection byproducts dbps due to the reaction of disinfectants with dbp precursors present in water trihalomethanes thms are one of the major classes of dbps formed during chlorination the concentration ratio of total organic halogen tox i e total concentration of halogenated compounds to thms typically varies between 3 10 depending upon the treatment conditions provided during the disinfection step 3 5 thms are known to be mutagenic and carcinogenic given the harmful effects of thms the us environmental protection agency epa has restricted the maximum contaminant level mcl for thms in groundwater and drinking water to be 80 μg l shifting to alternative disinfectants may reduce thm concentration however this may increase the concentration of other unidentified and potentially more toxic dbps 6 natural organic matter nom is the most critical thm precursor in surface water and groundwater 7 8 nom consists of a wide range of compounds varying from large aliphatic chains to highly colored aromatics the hydrophilic component of nom is characterized by a higher proportion of aliphatic carbon and nitrogenous compounds while aromatic carbon having phenolic structures and conjugated double bonds is the major constituent of the hydrophobic fraction 9 10 aromatic moieties mainly react with disinfectants through electrophilic substitution and addition reactions followed by hydrolysis and decarboxylation steps to form thms however aliphatic compounds produce thms via the haloform reaction 11 12 soluble microbial products smps and organic degradation products are commonly present in wastewater constituents of these wastewater organics include proteins humic acids polysaccharides and dna 13 dissolved organic matter dom present in wastewater has higher nitrogen content and less of highly aromatic organic matter as the wastewater effluents have been treated biologically the degradable organic matter present in the influent is removed such that the remaining organic matter is inherently more stable thus it is also less reactive with chlorine than nom derived from natural sources 14 however since the concentration of dissolved organic matter dom in wastewater is much higher significant dbp formation may occur during the chlorination of wastewater only a few studies have attempted the identification of wastewater precursors responsible for thm formation 15 17 the trend towards using treated effluents in various applications due to pressure on freshwater resources highlights the need to study the formation of dbps in wastewater systems the concentrations of dbps formed in drinking water as well as wastewater depend on various factors such as the type and dose of the disinfectant applied ph nitrogen content bromide and iodide ion concentration characteristics of dissolved organic matter and contact time for disinfection 4 8 18 21 in the absence of bromide and iodide ions in surface waters chlorinated byproducts predominate during disinfection with free chlorine hocl ocl however if bromide and iodide ions are present they get oxidized to hypobromous acid hypobromite hobr obr and hypoiodous acid hypoiodite hoi oi respectively subsequently they react with dbp precursors to form mixed chloro bromo chloro iodo and chloro bromo iodo substituted products 22 24 drinking water and wastewater treatment processes such as coagulation flocculation settling biofiltration and adsorption can remove organic matter however bromide ion removal is negligible in most conventional treatment processes 25 28 thus ultimately the concentration ratio of bromide ion to total organic carbon toc increases and this is likely to increase the fraction of brominated dbps 27 in waters with bromide concentration greater than 1 mg l brominated species such as bromoform and dibromoacetic acid have been observed 6 27 recent study has shown that elevated bromide ion concentrations also resulted in the formation of brominated species of aromatic halogenated dbps 29 thus various factors such as chlorine dose nature of organic matter ph contact time and the concentration of inorganic species eventually control the formation of dbps during chlorination of water and wastewater 13 21 23 30 32 in india chlorine is the preferred disinfectant used in most drinking water and wastewater treatment plants in contrast to surface waters in developed countries where strict environmental regulations ensure good quality the surface waters in developing countries such as india are often impacted by industrial effluents untreated wastewater partially treated wastewater from sewage treatment plants agricultural runoff containing pesticides and other pollutants arising from anthropogenic activities similarly domestic sewer lines may carry illegal discharges from hotels hospitals and other small scale industry premises which enter the sewage treatment plants thus the nature of organic compounds in indian wastewater may differ from that in other countries only limited studies have been conducted on total thm tthm formation and the role of various precursors present in the water and wastewater in india kumari and gupta 2015 modeled the formation of thms in drinking water supplies in the eastern part of india where linear regression was used to determine the effect of surrogate parameters such as toc and specific uv absorbance suva on thm formation in a similar study it was analyzed that the tthm concentration in drinking water supplies of the eastern region of india lies between 275 511 μg l which far exceeds the permissible usepa limit of 80 μg l 33 thm formation in water systems was also studied in other parts of india including delhi 34 and mumbai 35 tthm concentrations in the treated water from bhagirathi haiderpur nangloi okhla wazirabad and sonia vihar regions in delhi were 284 460 274 336 268 and 27 μg l respectively 34 similarly the maximum thm levels in the water samples collected at the outlet of the reservoirs located at bhandarwada borivali ghatkopar malbar trombay and worli in mumbai were 193 150 259 338 183 and 167 μg l respectively 35 however these studies did not relate dbp formation to the nature of the precursors present in water due to the lack of extensive studies in india focussing on characterization and identification of precursors responsible for thm formation more studies are required for determining the trihalomethane formation potential thmfp in indian drinking water and wastewater treatment systems moreover wastewater reuse is also commonly practiced in india it is thus essential to understand the impact of wastewater organics on thm formation the aim of this study was to compare the thmfp of water and wastewater samples collected from the western region of india the impact of ph contact time and bromide ion concentration on thm formation in water and wastewater treatment plant effluent was evaluated and thm formation was correlated with the concentration and nature of the dom precursors another objective was to determine the dom fraction in water and wastewater resulting in the highest thm formation potential identification of the fraction having the highest thmfp can help improve the conventional water and wastewater treatment trains through the inclusion of appropriate processes to remove the reactive species before the disinfection process 2 materials and methods 2 1 water and wastewater sampling water samples post filtration were collected from drinking water treatment plants wtp 1 and wtp 2 in the summer season march 2016 whereas secondary treated effluent samples were obtained from wastewater treatment plants wwtp 1 and wwtp 2 in monsoon season june 2015 and winter season january 2016 additional samples of secondary treated effluent were obtained from five wwtps wwtp 1 wwtp 2 wwtp 3 wwtp 4 and wwtp 5 in the summer season march 2016 to understand the interactions of specific dom fractions with chlorine an influent water sample from wtp 2 and a surface water sample from a freshwater source source 1 were also collected in march 2016 both the wtps had clariflocculator rapid sand filter and chlorination in the treatment train however wtp 2 had an additional prechlorination step all the wwtps except wwtp 2 were provided with grit chamber alone or grit chamber in combination with lagoons wwtp 2 was operated based on the cyclic activated sludge technology c tech the effluent was then subjected to disinfection 2 mg l of chlorine dose with a contact time of 30 min all the samples were filtered using a 0 45 μm membrane filter and were stored at 4 c prior to further analysis 2 2 chemicals and resins used solutions required for the determination of breakpoint chlorination profile and bromide ion concentration were prepared from reagent grade chemicals dilution of all the samples was performed using milli q water and the samples were stored at 4 оc and brought to room temperature before use the chlorine stock solution used for disinfection was prepared from 4 sodium hypochlorite naocl solution 99 purity merck india the thm standard epa 551 a purchased from sigma aldrich india contained chloroform 99 9 1 1 1 trichloroethane 97 2 carbon

amberlyst a15 cation exchange resin and amberlyst a21 anion exchange resin used for fractionation were obtained from sigma aldrich india 2 3 wastewater characterisation dom fractionation and fluorescence spectroscopy the characterization of dom in water and wastewater was performed using fluorescence spectroscopy and other surrogate parameters such as uv absorbance suva and dissolved organic carbon doc were also determined doc measurements were conducted using a total organic carbon analyzer toc vcsh shimadzu japan and uv absorbance at the selected wavelength was obtained using a uv spectrophotometer uv 1800 shimadzu japan suva at 254 nm suva254 was determined as uv254 doc where uv254 is the absorbance at 254 nm normalized to the path length 9 32 fluorescence measurements were made with a fluorescence spectrophotometer fluoromax 4 horiba usa the excitation emission matrices eems were produced with excitation and emission wavelength ranges of 220 400 nm and 250 600 nm respectively at a slit width of 5 nm the excitation wavelength was recorded at 5 nm increments whereas the emission wavelength was recorded at 2 nm increments the eem was subjected to various pre processing such as correction for raman effect inner filter effect blank subtraction and uv normalization finally the normalised data were subjected to fourier regional integration fri to identify different components of dom in various fractions as reported in the literature 36 37 this method decomposed the eem into five regions based on the fluorescence peaks a c b and t t1 t2 which corresponds to fulvic like humic like tyrosine like and tryptophan like substances in dom respectively the integrated regions were selected by drawing a horizontal line at 250 nm and two vertical lines at 330 and 380 nm the percentage fluorescence of each eem region was determined using the methodology proposed in earlier studies 36 37 ion chromatography 792 basic ic metrohm switzerland was used to determine the concentration of bromide ion in water wtp 1 and wtp 2 and wastewater samples wwtp 1 and wwtp 2 fractionation of organics into hydrophobic acid base and neutral and hydrophilic acid base and neutral fractions was performed to identify the dom fraction having the highest potential for thm formation the resin based dom fractionation procedure specified by leenheer 1981 was used to obtain six fractions of dom i e hydrophobic base hob hydrophobic acid hoa hydrophobic neutral hon hydrophilic base hib hydrophilic acid hia and hydrophilic neutral hin the detailed protocol for resin dax 8 amberlyst a 15 and amberlyst a 21 clean up followed by fractionation of dom in various water and wastewater samples is described in the electronic supplementary information esi a flow chart representing the analysis done on each sample is shown in fig s1 electronic supplementary information esi nom extraction was carried out as per the published literature 38 39 the resin based fractionation technique assumes 100 extraction efficiency thus the toc of the hon fraction was determined as the difference between total toc and sum of toc of all other fractions 38 2 4 analysis of thms in water and wastewater effluents for measuring chlorine residuals the titrimetric procedure with ferrous ammonium sulfate fas was used with n n diethyl p phenylenediamine dpd as the indicator as specified in standard methods 40 the reactions between the dbp precursors and chlorine were stopped by using ammonium chloride 41 42 epa 551a halogenated volatile mix was used for the analysis of thms both thm standards and samples were analyzed using a gas chromatograph gc equipped with an electron capture detector ecd and headspace sampler 6890 n agilent usa the column used was hp 5 30 m l x3 mm id x1 5 μm film thickness the sample placed in a headspace vial 10 ml was heated for 15 min at 70 c and subsequently an aliquot was injected into the gc the oven temperature program was set as follows 40 c for 5 min increased to 70 c at 4 c min where it was held constant for 2 min and subsequently increased to 100 c at 5 c min the detector temperature was maintained at 290 c the total run time was 20 5 min retention times for chloroform bromodichloromethane dibromochloromethane and bromoform were 4 76 7 35 10 76 and 15 42 min fig s4 esi the elution order of various compounds in the thm standard analyzed using the specified program was verified using a gc 7890 a agilent usa equipped with ms detector 5975 c agilent usa details in esi to determine the thmfp of water and wastewater effluents concentration of thms were quantified in water samples summer season collected from the filtration unit of the two wtps wtp 1 and wtp 2 and secondary treated wastewater samples collected in monsoon and winter seasons respectively tthm concentration was obtained as the summation of the concentration of the four major thms i e chloroform bromodichloromethane dibromochloromethane and bromoform factors such as contact time ph chlorine dose and bromide ion concentration were varied to observe their effect on tthm formation in drinking water and wastewater samples the chlorine dose was varied upto values above the breakpoint to determine the change in tthm formation beyond breakpoint tthm formation as a function of chlorine dose was determined for 2 h and 12 h contact time by adjusting the initial ph to 7 5 effect of bromide ion concentration and ph on tthm formation were also studied at 2 h contact time at a chlorine dose above the breakpoint all the measurements were done in triplicates 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of drinking water and wastewater samples the characterization results for drinking water and wastewater samples are shown in table 1 and their eem spectra are shown in figs 1 and 2 drinking water as well as wastewater samples exhibited low suva254 values ranging from 0 5 to 1 5 l mg m highlighting the absence of conjugated and aromatic structures 26 32 these values lie in the range observed for some earlier studies on treated water 0 8 1 8 l mg m and wastewater effluents 0 4 2 5 l mg m 10 43 45 results obtained from the fri technique are shown in the in figs s2 s3 esi for all the wastewater samples peaks in the protein like region dominate highlighting the presence of higher concentrations of tryptophan like substances other researchers have also reported the predominance of proteinaceous materials and smps in wastewater 46 47 high tryptophan like fluorescence intensity maximum fluorescence intensity at ex em wavelength 225 237 340 381 nm and 275 340 nm in the samples indicate the presence of hydrophilic and low molecular weight compounds 7 48 table s1 esi however the raw drinking water sample source 1 showed a high percentage of humic like components fig s2 esi as compared to treated drinking water samples highlighting the predominance of nom derived from the decomposition of plant tissues 7 49 the lower concentration of humic like components in wtp 1 can be attributed to the removal of organic components in the clariflocculator during the treatment process the lack of fulvic humic peak in wtp 2 filtered effluent may be attributed to the removal of the organic matter in the clariflocculator and to the removal of the fulvic humic fractions in the pre chlorination step in addition to humic like substances traces of protein like substances esi were also present in the drinking water samples indicating the contribution of organic matter of microbial and anthropogenic origin 49 3 2 determination of tthm formation potential in drinking water and wastewater samples wtp 1 and wtp 2 exhibited breakpoint at chlorine dose at 24 mg l and 70 mg l respectively wwtp 1 and wwtp 2 samples collected in the monsoon season achieved breakpoint at a chlorine dose of 8 and 12 mg l respectively whereas wwtp 1 and wwtp 2 samples collected in the winter season achieved breakpoint at a chlorine dose of 180 mg l and 125 mg l respectively fig 3 for samples collected in winter the higher breakpoint of wastewater obtained from wwtp 1 compared to wwtp 2 was possibly caused by its higher doc value table 1 surprisingly the monsoon wastewater samples exhibited a breakpoint chlorine dose that was even lower than for the drinking water samples although the doc in the monsoon wastewater samples were comparatively higher than for the wtp samples this can be attributed to the presence of higher organic nitrogen similar to protein like components in the wtp samples figs 1 and 2 which also resulted in a higher peak of combined chlorine residual fig 3 in the wtp samples compared to the monsoon wastewater samples the wastewater samples collected in the monsoon season exhibited about a 10 20 fold lower breakpoint chlorine dose than the samples collected in winter doc values for the wastewater samples collected in monsoon were 3 5 fold lower than for the samples collected in winter and this was also reflected in their lower tthm formation potential this can be attributed to the fact that during monsoon season the samples contain both sewage water and stormwater which resulted in lower doc values and lower tthm formation it may be noted that the total chlorine demand in wastewater is not due to dom alone thus the higher concentration of other constituents in the wastewater collected in winter such as br kjeldahl nitrogen fe2 and other reduced inorganic substances may have elevated the chlorine demand compared to the diluted monsoon wastewater samples 11 50 51 3 2 1 effect of chlorine dose and contact time tthm formation was found to increase continuously with an increase in chlorine dose due to oxidation of doc fig 3 typically oxidized products such as thms dominate at higher chlorine dose while substitution products are more predominant at a lower chlorine dose 8 the high chlorine doses were used to understand the difference in thm formation before and after breakpoint however except chloroform other thms i e brominated thms were not formed due to the absence of bromide ion in the monsoon wastewater samples table 1 some brominated thms were also observed for the winter wastewater samples as expected tthm formation increased with an increase in contact time from 2 to 12 h fig 3 the tthm formation potential normalized to doc for wwtp 1 and wwtp 2 samples collected in any season monsoon winter were comparable to each other however the winter samples showed a greater extent of tthm formation normalized to doc due to the higher chlorine dose used which was necessitated by the higher breakpoint for the winter samples fig 3a d however tthm formation normalized to doc for all the wastewater samples was significantly lower than that of the drinking water samples fig 3e f a marked increase in tthm formation was observed just beyond the breakpoint for all the samples collected a similar trend was observed by yang et al 2005 for wastewater effluents collected from different sewage treatment works in hong kong 45 at a dose below the breakpoint ammonia reacts with chlorine to form chloramines such that thm formation is suppressed formation of other categories of dbps upon chlorination of wastewater may also suppress thm formation 20 21 52 in comparison to the wastewater samples the drinking water samples from wtp 1 and wtp 2 demonstrated a steeper increase in tthm formation fig 3e f as chlorine dose was increased beyond the breakpoint and they also showed a more pronounced effect of an increase in contact time from 2 h to 12 h on tthm formation increasing the contact time increases the tthm formation through the hydrolysis of nom and through the decomposition of intermediate dbps formed 53 54 thus the ratio of the concentration of thms to total organic halide tox is reported to increase with an increase in contact time and vice versa 8 significantly higher thm formation was observed at 12 h contact time this can be attributed to the decomposition of high molecular weight structures or aromatic intermediated dbps at extended contact times 53 55 the results reveal that tthm formation in the water and wastewater effluents studied is affected by the contact time the chlorine dose and also by the predominant form of residual chlorine as also suggested by other researchers 8 56 the order of magnitude difference in tthm formation normalized to doc between the water and wastewater samples highlights the importance of the nature of dom on tthm formation the presence of more reactive humic like components in the drinking water samples possibly contributed to the increased formation of tthms compared to the wastewater samples dominated with protein like components figs 1 and 2 chlorine dose beyond the breakpoint increased the tthm formation rapidly emphasizing the need for optimizing both chlorine dose and contact time for achieving adequate disinfection while minimizing thm formation 3 2 2 effect of bromide ion concentration the effect of chlorinating bromide ion augmented wastewater and drinking water samples are illustrated in fig 4 the chlorine dose used for wwtp 1 monsoon sample wwtp 2 monsoon sample wwtp 1 winter sample wwtp 2 winter sample and wtp 1 and wtp 2 samples were 20 mg l 20 mg l 180 mg l 140 mg l 50 mg l and 80 mg l respectively for wastewater samples collected in monsoon season dibromochloromethane and bromoform formation did not occur until the spiked bromide ion concentration was increased to 4 mg l and 6 mg l for wwtp 1 and wwtp 2 respectively since bromide ion was already present in the winter season samples table 1 augmentation of only 1 mg l of bromide ion in the samples from both the wwtps resulted in a significant increase in the formation of brominated thms normalized to doc in bromide ion augmented water samples a rapid increase in the formation of brominated products was observed as the bromide ion concentration increased from 1 to 5 mg l fig 4 this observation confirms the presence of more hydrophilic low molecular weight aliphatic precursors in the drinking water samples and their more reactive nature as compared to the organic matter present in the wastewater samples 13 57 58 with increasing bromide ion concentration chloroform formation decreased whereas the concentration of brominated products increased with 5 mg l bromide ion augmentation the concentration of thms was found to be 10 μg l and 1 56 μg l for wwtp 1 and wwtp 2 in the monsoon season and 126 21 μg l and 208 56 μg l for wwtp 1 and wwtp 2 in the winter season and 282 μg l and 722 12 μg l for wtp 1 and wtp 2 respectively 3 2 3 effect of ph with an increase in ph from 5 5 to 8 tthm formation in both drinking water and wastewater samples increased as shown in fig 5 a and b in this part of the study the chlorine dose for each of the samples was kept above the breakpoint and a contact time of 2 h was provided all the samples were maintained at the desired ph value even after naocl addition a chlorine dose of 20 mg l was used for wwtp 1 and wwtp 2 monsoon samples for wwtp 1 and wwtp 2 winter samples the chlorine dose used was 180 mg l and 150 mg l respectively whereas for wtp 1 and wtp 2 water samples the chlorine dose used were 50 mg l and 80 mg l respectively the increasing trend in tthm formation with ph is due to an increase in doc hydrolysis that promotes the formation of thms 8 however hydrolysis of organochlorine intermediates followed by thm formation at alkaline ph range cannot be ignored also at higher ph values the thm tox ratio increases and vice versa 8 the reason for higher chloroform concentration at higher ph can be ascribed to the base catalyzed hydrolysis of thm precursors having structures such as r co ch3 59 comparison between drinking water and wastewater samples revealed that upon variation in ph from 5 5 to 8 the rate of tthm formation normalized to doc increased more steeply for the drinking water samples as compared to the wastewater samples possibly due to the presence of more reactive components in the surface water samples such as humic and fulvic acids figs 1 and 2 14 60 at neutral ph the concentration of tthm was found to be 3 25 μg l and 2 01 μg l for wwtp 1 and wwtp 2 in the monsoon season 127 06 μg l and 16 18 μg l for wwtp 1 and wwtp 2 in the winter season and 102 04 and 251 94 μg l for wtp 1 and wtp 2 respectively thus the concentration of tthm was found to exceed the usepa limit of 80 μg l similar observations have also been reported by other researchers for studies conducted in wtps in india 33 35 3 3 effect of thm formation on surrogate parameters the effect of chlorine dose on doc uv254 suva254 uv240 280 and suva240 280 was studied for a contact time of 2 and 12 h on all drinking water and wastewater samples since wastewater is a complex mixture of diverse organic compounds uv absorbance over the range of 240 280 nm was also determined in addition to uv254 the decrease in uv uv254 and uv240 280 doc and suva values confirmed the reaction of organics with the disinfectant to form dbps 32 61 the trends in these parameters for drinking water and wastewater samples for 2 h and 12 h contact time are shown in figs s5 s16 esi both drinking water and wastewater showed a decrease in these surrogate parameters however the decrease was more pronounced when contact time was increased the comparatively lower decrease in uv254 absorbance values on chlorination highlights that in low suva samples thm formation after chlorination does not directly depend on the destruction of uv254 absorbing sites nom moieties not absorbing uv light also play an important role in thm formation in waters with hydrophilic character 32 3 4 comparison of thm formation in drinking water and wastewater samples to compare the reactivity of organic matter present in drinking water and wastewater samples thm formation in drinking water and wastewater samples were observed at a fixed chlorine dose of 40 mg l at 2 and 12 h contact time fig s17 esi only chloroform was observed in wastewater samples collected in the monsoon season due to the absence of bromide ion table 1 whereas in the winter season three of the thms all excluding bromoform were formed for the drinking water samples also the same three thms were observed however the concentration of brominated products was significantly lower compared to chloroform possibly due to the lower concentration of bromide ion in drinking water as discussed in section 3 2 the chlorination of drinking water resulted in a higher concentration of tthm at 40 mg l chlorine dose and 12 h contact time the concentration of chloroform in drinking water samples ranged between 330 2 μg l to 405 7 μg l whereas for wastewater samples it ranged between 7 3 to 12 8 μg l higher concentrations of chloroform 300 μg l 600 μg l upon disinfection in water treatment plants have been reported earlier in other parts of india 34 62 63 a comparison between wastewater samples collected in the two seasons revealed that tthm formation potential for samples collected in winter was higher than for samples collected in monsoon in the monsoon season wastewater samples no brominated products were observed whereas a significant contribution of brominated products was observed in the winter season samples this trend can be attributed to the presence of bromide ion in the winter season samples in the monsoon season the wwtp 1 sample resulted in greater tthm formation than the wwtp 2 sample for a similar chlorine dose of 40 mg l this may be attributed to the fact that the breakpoint of the wwtp 1 sample was 8 mg l and beyond this dose a steep increase in the concentration of tthms was observed fig 3a and b the slope of tthm formation in wwtp 1 was steeper than that in wwtp 2 highlighting the reactive nature of precursor species in wwtp 1 comparing tthm formation in two seasons it can be inferred that the organics present in wastewater samples collected in monsoon were inherently less reactive due to the diluted nature and lower doc of the samples 3 5 determination of tthm formation by various fractions of dom variation in the tthm formation potential for each fraction of dom collected from drinking water and wastewater samples at a fixed chlorine dose of 50 mg l the contact time of 12 h and initial ph of 7 is shown in fig 6 for each sample the doc value of all fractions was maintained equal to that of the fraction exhibiting the lowest doc and tthm formation was determined as a measure of its reactivity with chlorine for drinking water samples hon was found to be the most reactive fraction for source 1 272 62 μg tthm mg doc wtp 1 filtered effluent 2348 10 μg tthm mg doc and wtp 2 influent 660 48 μg tthm mg doc samples however for wtp 2 filtered effluent hoa 776 10 μg tthm mg doc was found to be the most reactive fraction the high reactivity of the hoa fraction of dom has also been reported for water samples from china and taiwan 64 65 a high correlation was observed between thmfp and hydrophobic fraction present in raw and treated surface waters in a recent study conducted in scotland 66 for the wastewater samples wwtp 1 9 33 μg tthm mg doc wwtp 4 6 45 μg tthm mg doc and wwtp 5 11 83 μg tthm mg doc the hoa fraction was found to be the most reactive fraction resulting in the highest tthm formation generally hoa fraction of dom is characteised by humic acids and aromatic proteins 67 and the role humic acids for the formation of tthm has been reported in the literature 68 thus the high reactivity of hoa is possibly due to the presence of both aromatic moieties and aliphatic structures 67 in contrast hon was found to be the most reactive fraction for the samples collected from wwtp 2 27 47 μg tthm mg doc and wwtp 3 454 60 μg tthm mg doc hon fraction of dom is prominently composed of smps phenolic substances and simple aromatic proteins 67 69 which might have possibly contributed to the tthm formation as has been reported 59 insignificant tthm formation was observed in the presence of the hydrophilic organics possibly due to the lower predominance of aromatic moieties and the lower molecular weight of the hydrophilic fractions 67 however some studies have also reported high reactivity associated with the hydrophilic fractions of dom 59 70 since the structure of the various fractions of dom is likely to vary with the source water variability in results across different studies may be expected the relative distribution of aliphatic and aromatic organics in water wastewater decides the formation of tthm which is a function of the source and type of water and wastewater and the type of treatment processes employed 56 4 conclusions although suva values were low for all the drinking water and wastewater samples from western india significant thm formation was observed in wastewater effluents a large variation in thm formation at a chlorine dose beyond breakpoint was observed for two seasons even after normalization with doc highlighting the variations in the reactivities of doc fractions with chlorine in wastewater effluents even after the breakpoint a lower concentration of thms was observed compared to drinking water indicating the stabilized and less reactive nature of the organic matter in wastewater the organics in water dominated by humic like components were more reactive with respect to thm formation than organics in a wastewater dominated by protein like components chloroform was the most abundant thm due to the absence or low concentration of bromide ion in all the samples however studies with augmentation of bromide ion indicated the significant potential for the formation of brominated thms in water and wastewater thm formation potential evaluated after fractionation of dom revealed that the hydrophobic acid and neutral fractions were the most reactive fractions of dom the hydrophilic fractions of dom in both water and wastewater from western india had a minor role in thm formation thus the implementation of treatment processes that result in the reduction of hydrophobic acid and neutral fractions can reduce thm formation significantly moreover the prechlorination step as used in wtp 2 should be avoided to limit the formation of thms research data for this

13631,dissolved organic matter dom is the primary precursor that reacts with chlorine to form potentially carcinogenic mutagenic disinfection byproducts dbps the prime objective of this study was to compare the nature of dom in samples collected from drinking water and wastewater treatment plants in western india and to relate their nature and concentration to trihalomethane thm formation the effects of chlorine dose bromide ion contact time and ph on thm formation were also studied the surrogate parameters such as uv absorbance at 254 nm and dissolved organic carbon doc were monitored for each experiment to understand their correlation with thm formation in the selected water and wastewater systems fluorescence spectroscopy revealed that dom in wastewater was dominated by protein like components while dom in water samples consisted mostly of humic like components which exhibited greater thm formation potential fractionation of dom into various fractions followed by reaction with chlorine revealed that the hydrophobic acid and neutral fractions of dom were primarily responsible for thm formation thus methods that target removing these fractions before chlorination would have maximum impact on reducing thm formation keywords disinfection byproducts trihalomethanes trihalomethane formation potential natural organic matter dissolved organic matter total organic carbon 1 introduction disinfection is applied as a finishing step during water and wastewater treatment to inactivate pathogens 1 2 however the disinfection process leads to the formation of disinfection byproducts dbps due to the reaction of disinfectants with dbp precursors present in water trihalomethanes thms are one of the major classes of dbps formed during chlorination the concentration ratio of total organic halogen tox i e total concentration of halogenated compounds to thms typically varies between 3 10 depending upon the treatment conditions provided during the disinfection step 3 5 thms are known to be mutagenic and carcinogenic given the harmful effects of thms the us environmental protection agency epa has restricted the maximum contaminant level mcl for thms in groundwater and drinking water to be 80 μg l shifting to alternative disinfectants may reduce thm concentration however this may increase the concentration of other unidentified and potentially more toxic dbps 6 natural organic matter nom is the most critical thm precursor in surface water and groundwater 7 8 nom consists of a wide range of compounds varying from large aliphatic chains to highly colored aromatics the hydrophilic component of nom is characterized by a higher proportion of aliphatic carbon and nitrogenous compounds while aromatic carbon having phenolic structures and conjugated double bonds is the major constituent of the hydrophobic fraction 9 10 aromatic moieties mainly react with disinfectants through electrophilic substitution and addition reactions followed by hydrolysis and decarboxylation steps to form thms however aliphatic compounds produce thms via the haloform reaction 11 12 soluble microbial products smps and organic degradation products are commonly present in wastewater constituents of these wastewater organics include proteins humic acids polysaccharides and dna 13 dissolved organic matter dom present in wastewater has higher nitrogen content and less of highly aromatic organic matter as the wastewater effluents have been treated biologically the degradable organic matter present in the influent is removed such that the remaining organic matter is inherently more stable thus it is also less reactive with chlorine than nom derived from natural sources 14 however since the concentration of dissolved organic matter dom in wastewater is much higher significant dbp formation may occur during the chlorination of wastewater only a few studies have attempted the identification of wastewater precursors responsible for thm formation 15 17 the trend towards using treated effluents in various applications due to pressure on freshwater resources highlights the need to study the formation of dbps in wastewater systems the concentrations of dbps formed in drinking water as well as wastewater depend on various factors such as the type and dose of the disinfectant applied ph nitrogen content bromide and iodide ion concentration characteristics of dissolved organic matter and contact time for disinfection 4 8 18 21 in the absence of bromide and iodide ions in surface waters chlorinated byproducts predominate during disinfection with free chlorine hocl ocl however if bromide and iodide ions are present they get oxidized to hypobromous acid hypobromite hobr obr and hypoiodous acid hypoiodite hoi oi respectively subsequently they react with dbp precursors to form mixed chloro bromo chloro iodo and chloro bromo iodo substituted products 22 24 drinking water and wastewater treatment processes such as coagulation flocculation settling biofiltration and adsorption can remove organic matter however bromide ion removal is negligible in most conventional treatment processes 25 28 thus ultimately the concentration ratio of bromide ion to total organic carbon toc increases and this is likely to increase the fraction of brominated dbps 27 in waters with bromide concentration greater than 1 mg l brominated species such as bromoform and dibromoacetic acid have been observed 6 27 recent study has shown that elevated bromide ion concentrations also resulted in the formation of brominated species of aromatic halogenated dbps 29 thus various factors such as chlorine dose nature of organic matter ph contact time and the concentration of inorganic species eventually control the formation of dbps during chlorination of water and wastewater 13 21 23 30 32 in india chlorine is the preferred disinfectant used in most drinking water and wastewater treatment plants in contrast to surface waters in developed countries where strict environmental regulations ensure good quality the surface waters in developing countries such as india are often impacted by industrial effluents untreated wastewater partially treated wastewater from sewage treatment plants agricultural runoff containing pesticides and other pollutants arising from anthropogenic activities similarly domestic sewer lines may carry illegal discharges from hotels hospitals and other small scale industry premises which enter the sewage treatment plants thus the nature of organic compounds in indian wastewater may differ from that in other countries only limited studies have been conducted on total thm tthm formation and the role of various precursors present in the water and wastewater in india kumari and gupta 2015 modeled the formation of thms in drinking water supplies in the eastern part of india where linear regression was used to determine the effect of surrogate parameters such as toc and specific uv absorbance suva on thm formation in a similar study it was analyzed that the tthm concentration in drinking water supplies of the eastern region of india lies between 275 511 μg l which far exceeds the permissible usepa limit of 80 μg l 33 thm formation in water systems was also studied in other parts of india including delhi 34 and mumbai 35 tthm concentrations in the treated water from bhagirathi haiderpur nangloi okhla wazirabad and sonia vihar regions in delhi were 284 460 274 336 268 and 27 μg l respectively 34 similarly the maximum thm levels in the water samples collected at the outlet of the reservoirs located at bhandarwada borivali ghatkopar malbar trombay and worli in mumbai were 193 150 259 338 183 and 167 μg l respectively 35 however these studies did not relate dbp formation to the nature of the precursors present in water due to the lack of extensive studies in india focussing on characterization and identification of precursors responsible for thm formation more studies are required for determining the trihalomethane formation potential thmfp in indian drinking water and wastewater treatment systems moreover wastewater reuse is also commonly practiced in india it is thus essential to understand the impact of wastewater organics on thm formation the aim of this study was to compare the thmfp of water and wastewater samples collected from the western region of india the impact of ph contact time and bromide ion concentration on thm formation in water and wastewater treatment plant effluent was evaluated and thm formation was correlated with the concentration and nature of the dom precursors another objective was to determine the dom fraction in water and wastewater resulting in the highest thm formation potential identification of the fraction having the highest thmfp can help improve the conventional water and wastewater treatment trains through the inclusion of appropriate processes to remove the reactive species before the disinfection process 2 materials and methods 2 1 water and wastewater sampling water samples post filtration were collected from drinking water treatment plants wtp 1 and wtp 2 in the summer season march 2016 whereas secondary treated effluent samples were obtained from wastewater treatment plants wwtp 1 and wwtp 2 in monsoon season june 2015 and winter season january 2016 additional samples of secondary treated effluent were obtained from five wwtps wwtp 1 wwtp 2 wwtp 3 wwtp 4 and wwtp 5 in the summer season march 2016 to understand the interactions of specific dom fractions with chlorine an influent water sample from wtp 2 and a surface water sample from a freshwater source source 1 were also collected in march 2016 both the wtps had clariflocculator rapid sand filter and chlorination in the treatment train however wtp 2 had an additional prechlorination step all the wwtps except wwtp 2 were provided with grit chamber alone or grit chamber in combination with lagoons wwtp 2 was operated based on the cyclic activated sludge technology c tech the effluent was then subjected to disinfection 2 mg l of chlorine dose with a contact time of 30 min all the samples were filtered using a 0 45 μm membrane filter and were stored at 4 c prior to further analysis 2 2 chemicals and resins used solutions required for the determination of breakpoint chlorination profile and bromide ion concentration were prepared from reagent grade chemicals dilution of all the samples was performed using milli q water and the samples were stored at 4 оc and brought to room temperature before use the chlorine stock solution used for disinfection was prepared from 4 sodium hypochlorite naocl solution 99 purity merck india the thm standard epa 551 a purchased from sigma aldrich india contained chloroform 99 9 1 1 1 trichloroethane 97 2 carbon

amberlyst a15 cation exchange resin and amberlyst a21 anion exchange resin used for fractionation were obtained from sigma aldrich india 2 3 wastewater characterisation dom fractionation and fluorescence spectroscopy the characterization of dom in water and wastewater was performed using fluorescence spectroscopy and other surrogate parameters such as uv absorbance suva and dissolved organic carbon doc were also determined doc measurements were conducted using a total organic carbon analyzer toc vcsh shimadzu japan and uv absorbance at the selected wavelength was obtained using a uv spectrophotometer uv 1800 shimadzu japan suva at 254 nm suva254 was determined as uv254 doc where uv254 is the absorbance at 254 nm normalized to the path length 9 32 fluorescence measurements were made with a fluorescence spectrophotometer fluoromax 4 horiba usa the excitation emission matrices eems were produced with excitation and emission wavelength ranges of 220 400 nm and 250 600 nm respectively at a slit width of 5 nm the excitation wavelength was recorded at 5 nm increments whereas the emission wavelength was recorded at 2 nm increments the eem was subjected to various pre processing such as correction for raman effect inner filter effect blank subtraction and uv normalization finally the normalised data were subjected to fourier regional integration fri to identify different components of dom in various fractions as reported in the literature 36 37 this method decomposed the eem into five regions based on the fluorescence peaks a c b and t t1 t2 which corresponds to fulvic like humic like tyrosine like and tryptophan like substances in dom respectively the integrated regions were selected by drawing a horizontal line at 250 nm and two vertical lines at 330 and 380 nm the percentage fluorescence of each eem region was determined using the methodology proposed in earlier studies 36 37 ion chromatography 792 basic ic metrohm switzerland was used to determine the concentration of bromide ion in water wtp 1 and wtp 2 and wastewater samples wwtp 1 and wwtp 2 fractionation of organics into hydrophobic acid base and neutral and hydrophilic acid base and neutral fractions was performed to identify the dom fraction having the highest potential for thm formation the resin based dom fractionation procedure specified by leenheer 1981 was used to obtain six fractions of dom i e hydrophobic base hob hydrophobic acid hoa hydrophobic neutral hon hydrophilic base hib hydrophilic acid hia and hydrophilic neutral hin the detailed protocol for resin dax 8 amberlyst a 15 and amberlyst a 21 clean up followed by fractionation of dom in various water and wastewater samples is described in the electronic supplementary information esi a flow chart representing the analysis done on each sample is shown in fig s1 electronic supplementary information esi nom extraction was carried out as per the published literature 38 39 the resin based fractionation technique assumes 100 extraction efficiency thus the toc of the hon fraction was determined as the difference between total toc and sum of toc of all other fractions 38 2 4 analysis of thms in water and wastewater effluents for measuring chlorine residuals the titrimetric procedure with ferrous ammonium sulfate fas was used with n n diethyl p phenylenediamine dpd as the indicator as specified in standard methods 40 the reactions between the dbp precursors and chlorine were stopped by using ammonium chloride 41 42 epa 551a halogenated volatile mix was used for the analysis of thms both thm standards and samples were analyzed using a gas chromatograph gc equipped with an electron capture detector ecd and headspace sampler 6890 n agilent usa the column used was hp 5 30 m l x3 mm id x1 5 μm film thickness the sample placed in a headspace vial 10 ml was heated for 15 min at 70 c and subsequently an aliquot was injected into the gc the oven temperature program was set as follows 40 c for 5 min increased to 70 c at 4 c min where it was held constant for 2 min and subsequently increased to 100 c at 5 c min the detector temperature was maintained at 290 c the total run time was 20 5 min retention times for chloroform bromodichloromethane dibromochloromethane and bromoform were 4 76 7 35 10 76 and 15 42 min fig s4 esi the elution order of various compounds in the thm standard analyzed using the specified program was verified using a gc 7890 a agilent usa equipped with ms detector 5975 c agilent usa details in esi to determine the thmfp of water and wastewater effluents concentration of thms were quantified in water samples summer season collected from the filtration unit of the two wtps wtp 1 and wtp 2 and secondary treated wastewater samples collected in monsoon and winter seasons respectively tthm concentration was obtained as the summation of the concentration of the four major thms i e chloroform bromodichloromethane dibromochloromethane and bromoform factors such as contact time ph chlorine dose and bromide ion concentration were varied to observe their effect on tthm formation in drinking water and wastewater samples the chlorine dose was varied upto values above the breakpoint to determine the change in tthm formation beyond breakpoint tthm formation as a function of chlorine dose was determined for 2 h and 12 h contact time by adjusting the initial ph to 7 5 effect of bromide ion concentration and ph on tthm formation were also studied at 2 h contact time at a chlorine dose above the breakpoint all the measurements were done in triplicates 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of drinking water and wastewater samples the characterization results for drinking water and wastewater samples are shown in table 1 and their eem spectra are shown in figs 1 and 2 drinking water as well as wastewater samples exhibited low suva254 values ranging from 0 5 to 1 5 l mg m highlighting the absence of conjugated and aromatic structures 26 32 these values lie in the range observed for some earlier studies on treated water 0 8 1 8 l mg m and wastewater effluents 0 4 2 5 l mg m 10 43 45 results obtained from the fri technique are shown in the in figs s2 s3 esi for all the wastewater samples peaks in the protein like region dominate highlighting the presence of higher concentrations of tryptophan like substances other researchers have also reported the predominance of proteinaceous materials and smps in wastewater 46 47 high tryptophan like fluorescence intensity maximum fluorescence intensity at ex em wavelength 225 237 340 381 nm and 275 340 nm in the samples indicate the presence of hydrophilic and low molecular weight compounds 7 48 table s1 esi however the raw drinking water sample source 1 showed a high percentage of humic like components fig s2 esi as compared to treated drinking water samples highlighting the predominance of nom derived from the decomposition of plant tissues 7 49 the lower concentration of humic like components in wtp 1 can be attributed to the removal of organic components in the clariflocculator during the treatment process the lack of fulvic humic peak in wtp 2 filtered effluent may be attributed to the removal of the organic matter in the clariflocculator and to the removal of the fulvic humic fractions in the pre chlorination step in addition to humic like substances traces of protein like substances esi were also present in the drinking water samples indicating the contribution of organic matter of microbial and anthropogenic origin 49 3 2 determination of tthm formation potential in drinking water and wastewater samples wtp 1 and wtp 2 exhibited breakpoint at chlorine dose at 24 mg l and 70 mg l respectively wwtp 1 and wwtp 2 samples collected in the monsoon season achieved breakpoint at a chlorine dose of 8 and 12 mg l respectively whereas wwtp 1 and wwtp 2 samples collected in the winter season achieved breakpoint at a chlorine dose of 180 mg l and 125 mg l respectively fig 3 for samples collected in winter the higher breakpoint of wastewater obtained from wwtp 1 compared to wwtp 2 was possibly caused by its higher doc value table 1 surprisingly the monsoon wastewater samples exhibited a breakpoint chlorine dose that was even lower than for the drinking water samples although the doc in the monsoon wastewater samples were comparatively higher than for the wtp samples this can be attributed to the presence of higher organic nitrogen similar to protein like components in the wtp samples figs 1 and 2 which also resulted in a higher peak of combined chlorine residual fig 3 in the wtp samples compared to the monsoon wastewater samples the wastewater samples collected in the monsoon season exhibited about a 10 20 fold lower breakpoint chlorine dose than the samples collected in winter doc values for the wastewater samples collected in monsoon were 3 5 fold lower than for the samples collected in winter and this was also reflected in their lower tthm formation potential this can be attributed to the fact that during monsoon season the samples contain both sewage water and stormwater which resulted in lower doc values and lower tthm formation it may be noted that the total chlorine demand in wastewater is not due to dom alone thus the higher concentration of other constituents in the wastewater collected in winter such as br kjeldahl nitrogen fe2 and other reduced inorganic substances may have elevated the chlorine demand compared to the diluted monsoon wastewater samples 11 50 51 3 2 1 effect of chlorine dose and contact time tthm formation was found to increase continuously with an increase in chlorine dose due to oxidation of doc fig 3 typically oxidized products such as thms dominate at higher chlorine dose while substitution products are more predominant at a lower chlorine dose 8 the high chlorine doses were used to understand the difference in thm formation before and after breakpoint however except chloroform other thms i e brominated thms were not formed due to the absence of bromide ion in the monsoon wastewater samples table 1 some brominated thms were also observed for the winter wastewater samples as expected tthm formation increased with an increase in contact time from 2 to 12 h fig 3 the tthm formation potential normalized to doc for wwtp 1 and wwtp 2 samples collected in any season monsoon winter were comparable to each other however the winter samples showed a greater extent of tthm formation normalized to doc due to the higher chlorine dose used which was necessitated by the higher breakpoint for the winter samples fig 3a d however tthm formation normalized to doc for all the wastewater samples was significantly lower than that of the drinking water samples fig 3e f a marked increase in tthm formation was observed just beyond the breakpoint for all the samples collected a similar trend was observed by yang et al 2005 for wastewater effluents collected from different sewage treatment works in hong kong 45 at a dose below the breakpoint ammonia reacts with chlorine to form chloramines such that thm formation is suppressed formation of other categories of dbps upon chlorination of wastewater may also suppress thm formation 20 21 52 in comparison to the wastewater samples the drinking water samples from wtp 1 and wtp 2 demonstrated a steeper increase in tthm formation fig 3e f as chlorine dose was increased beyond the breakpoint and they also showed a more pronounced effect of an increase in contact time from 2 h to 12 h on tthm formation increasing the contact time increases the tthm formation through the hydrolysis of nom and through the decomposition of intermediate dbps formed 53 54 thus the ratio of the concentration of thms to total organic halide tox is reported to increase with an increase in contact time and vice versa 8 significantly higher thm formation was observed at 12 h contact time this can be attributed to the decomposition of high molecular weight structures or aromatic intermediated dbps at extended contact times 53 55 the results reveal that tthm formation in the water and wastewater effluents studied is affected by the contact time the chlorine dose and also by the predominant form of residual chlorine as also suggested by other researchers 8 56 the order of magnitude difference in tthm formation normalized to doc between the water and wastewater samples highlights the importance of the nature of dom on tthm formation the presence of more reactive humic like components in the drinking water samples possibly contributed to the increased formation of tthms compared to the wastewater samples dominated with protein like components figs 1 and 2 chlorine dose beyond the breakpoint increased the tthm formation rapidly emphasizing the need for optimizing both chlorine dose and contact time for achieving adequate disinfection while minimizing thm formation 3 2 2 effect of bromide ion concentration the effect of chlorinating bromide ion augmented wastewater and drinking water samples are illustrated in fig 4 the chlorine dose used for wwtp 1 monsoon sample wwtp 2 monsoon sample wwtp 1 winter sample wwtp 2 winter sample and wtp 1 and wtp 2 samples were 20 mg l 20 mg l 180 mg l 140 mg l 50 mg l and 80 mg l respectively for wastewater samples collected in monsoon season dibromochloromethane and bromoform formation did not occur until the spiked bromide ion concentration was increased to 4 mg l and 6 mg l for wwtp 1 and wwtp 2 respectively since bromide ion was already present in the winter season samples table 1 augmentation of only 1 mg l of bromide ion in the samples from both the wwtps resulted in a significant increase in the formation of brominated thms normalized to doc in bromide ion augmented water samples a rapid increase in the formation of brominated products was observed as the bromide ion concentration increased from 1 to 5 mg l fig 4 this observation confirms the presence of more hydrophilic low molecular weight aliphatic precursors in the drinking water samples and their more reactive nature as compared to the organic matter present in the wastewater samples 13 57 58 with increasing bromide ion concentration chloroform formation decreased whereas the concentration of brominated products increased with 5 mg l bromide ion augmentation the concentration of thms was found to be 10 μg l and 1 56 μg l for wwtp 1 and wwtp 2 in the monsoon season and 126 21 μg l and 208 56 μg l for wwtp 1 and wwtp 2 in the winter season and 282 μg l and 722 12 μg l for wtp 1 and wtp 2 respectively 3 2 3 effect of ph with an increase in ph from 5 5 to 8 tthm formation in both drinking water and wastewater samples increased as shown in fig 5 a and b in this part of the study the chlorine dose for each of the samples was kept above the breakpoint and a contact time of 2 h was provided all the samples were maintained at the desired ph value even after naocl addition a chlorine dose of 20 mg l was used for wwtp 1 and wwtp 2 monsoon samples for wwtp 1 and wwtp 2 winter samples the chlorine dose used was 180 mg l and 150 mg l respectively whereas for wtp 1 and wtp 2 water samples the chlorine dose used were 50 mg l and 80 mg l respectively the increasing trend in tthm formation with ph is due to an increase in doc hydrolysis that promotes the formation of thms 8 however hydrolysis of organochlorine intermediates followed by thm formation at alkaline ph range cannot be ignored also at higher ph values the thm tox ratio increases and vice versa 8 the reason for higher chloroform concentration at higher ph can be ascribed to the base catalyzed hydrolysis of thm precursors having structures such as r co ch3 59 comparison between drinking water and wastewater samples revealed that upon variation in ph from 5 5 to 8 the rate of tthm formation normalized to doc increased more steeply for the drinking water samples as compared to the wastewater samples possibly due to the presence of more reactive components in the surface water samples such as humic and fulvic acids figs 1 and 2 14 60 at neutral ph the concentration of tthm was found to be 3 25 μg l and 2 01 μg l for wwtp 1 and wwtp 2 in the monsoon season 127 06 μg l and 16 18 μg l for wwtp 1 and wwtp 2 in the winter season and 102 04 and 251 94 μg l for wtp 1 and wtp 2 respectively thus the concentration of tthm was found to exceed the usepa limit of 80 μg l similar observations have also been reported by other researchers for studies conducted in wtps in india 33 35 3 3 effect of thm formation on surrogate parameters the effect of chlorine dose on doc uv254 suva254 uv240 280 and suva240 280 was studied for a contact time of 2 and 12 h on all drinking water and wastewater samples since wastewater is a complex mixture of diverse organic compounds uv absorbance over the range of 240 280 nm was also determined in addition to uv254 the decrease in uv uv254 and uv240 280 doc and suva values confirmed the reaction of organics with the disinfectant to form dbps 32 61 the trends in these parameters for drinking water and wastewater samples for 2 h and 12 h contact time are shown in figs s5 s16 esi both drinking water and wastewater showed a decrease in these surrogate parameters however the decrease was more pronounced when contact time was increased the comparatively lower decrease in uv254 absorbance values on chlorination highlights that in low suva samples thm formation after chlorination does not directly depend on the destruction of uv254 absorbing sites nom moieties not absorbing uv light also play an important role in thm formation in waters with hydrophilic character 32 3 4 comparison of thm formation in drinking water and wastewater samples to compare the reactivity of organic matter present in drinking water and wastewater samples thm formation in drinking water and wastewater samples were observed at a fixed chlorine dose of 40 mg l at 2 and 12 h contact time fig s17 esi only chloroform was observed in wastewater samples collected in the monsoon season due to the absence of bromide ion table 1 whereas in the winter season three of the thms all excluding bromoform were formed for the drinking water samples also the same three thms were observed however the concentration of brominated products was significantly lower compared to chloroform possibly due to the lower concentration of bromide ion in drinking water as discussed in section 3 2 the chlorination of drinking water resulted in a higher concentration of tthm at 40 mg l chlorine dose and 12 h contact time the concentration of chloroform in drinking water samples ranged between 330 2 μg l to 405 7 μg l whereas for wastewater samples it ranged between 7 3 to 12 8 μg l higher concentrations of chloroform 300 μg l 600 μg l upon disinfection in water treatment plants have been reported earlier in other parts of india 34 62 63 a comparison between wastewater samples collected in the two seasons revealed that tthm formation potential for samples collected in winter was higher than for samples collected in monsoon in the monsoon season wastewater samples no brominated products were observed whereas a significant contribution of brominated products was observed in the winter season samples this trend can be attributed to the presence of bromide ion in the winter season samples in the monsoon season the wwtp 1 sample resulted in greater tthm formation than the wwtp 2 sample for a similar chlorine dose of 40 mg l this may be attributed to the fact that the breakpoint of the wwtp 1 sample was 8 mg l and beyond this dose a steep increase in the concentration of tthms was observed fig 3a and b the slope of tthm formation in wwtp 1 was steeper than that in wwtp 2 highlighting the reactive nature of precursor species in wwtp 1 comparing tthm formation in two seasons it can be inferred that the organics present in wastewater samples collected in monsoon were inherently less reactive due to the diluted nature and lower doc of the samples 3 5 determination of tthm formation by various fractions of dom variation in the tthm formation potential for each fraction of dom collected from drinking water and wastewater samples at a fixed chlorine dose of 50 mg l the contact time of 12 h and initial ph of 7 is shown in fig 6 for each sample the doc value of all fractions was maintained equal to that of the fraction exhibiting the lowest doc and tthm formation was determined as a measure of its reactivity with chlorine for drinking water samples hon was found to be the most reactive fraction for source 1 272 62 μg tthm mg doc wtp 1 filtered effluent 2348 10 μg tthm mg doc and wtp 2 influent 660 48 μg tthm mg doc samples however for wtp 2 filtered effluent hoa 776 10 μg tthm mg doc was found to be the most reactive fraction the high reactivity of the hoa fraction of dom has also been reported for water samples from china and taiwan 64 65 a high correlation was observed between thmfp and hydrophobic fraction present in raw and treated surface waters in a recent study conducted in scotland 66 for the wastewater samples wwtp 1 9 33 μg tthm mg doc wwtp 4 6 45 μg tthm mg doc and wwtp 5 11 83 μg tthm mg doc the hoa fraction was found to be the most reactive fraction resulting in the highest tthm formation generally hoa fraction of dom is characteised by humic acids and aromatic proteins 67 and the role humic acids for the formation of tthm has been reported in the literature 68 thus the high reactivity of hoa is possibly due to the presence of both aromatic moieties and aliphatic structures 67 in contrast hon was found to be the most reactive fraction for the samples collected from wwtp 2 27 47 μg tthm mg doc and wwtp 3 454 60 μg tthm mg doc hon fraction of dom is prominently composed of smps phenolic substances and simple aromatic proteins 67 69 which might have possibly contributed to the tthm formation as has been reported 59 insignificant tthm formation was observed in the presence of the hydrophilic organics possibly due to the lower predominance of aromatic moieties and the lower molecular weight of the hydrophilic fractions 67 however some studies have also reported high reactivity associated with the hydrophilic fractions of dom 59 70 since the structure of the various fractions of dom is likely to vary with the source water variability in results across different studies may be expected the relative distribution of aliphatic and aromatic organics in water wastewater decides the formation of tthm which is a function of the source and type of water and wastewater and the type of treatment processes employed 56 4 conclusions although suva values were low for all the drinking water and wastewater samples from western india significant thm formation was observed in wastewater effluents a large variation in thm formation at a chlorine dose beyond breakpoint was observed for two seasons even after normalization with doc highlighting the variations in the reactivities of doc fractions with chlorine in wastewater effluents even after the breakpoint a lower concentration of thms was observed compared to drinking water indicating the stabilized and less reactive nature of the organic matter in wastewater the organics in water dominated by humic like components were more reactive with respect to thm formation than organics in a wastewater dominated by protein like components chloroform was the most abundant thm due to the absence or low concentration of bromide ion in all the samples however studies with augmentation of bromide ion indicated the significant potential for the formation of brominated thms in water and wastewater thm formation potential evaluated after fractionation of dom revealed that the hydrophobic acid and neutral fractions were the most reactive fractions of dom the hydrophilic fractions of dom in both water and wastewater from western india had a minor role in thm formation thus the implementation of treatment processes that result in the reduction of hydrophobic acid and neutral fractions can reduce thm formation significantly moreover the prechlorination step as used in wtp 2 should be avoided to limit the formation of thms research data for this

13632,silver loaded stainless steel ag ss was applied in domestic hot water system dhws to control the biofilm contamination the antibacterial properties of ag ss as well as the bacterial communities potential pathogens and antibiotic resistance genes args of pipe wall biofilm were investigated with ss as control ag ss maintained a high antibacterial efficiency on heterotrophic bacteria 70 60 13 22 and escherichia coli 73 56 10 62 by contact bacteriostasis dominant phyla exhibited a lower relative abundance in ag ss than ss the bacteria were further classified into abundant 1 moderately abundant 0 1 1 and rare 0 1 taxa to investigate their responses to silver there were 15 33 of shared operational taxonomic units otus belonged to abundant taxa while most unique otus 80 of each sample were identified as rare taxa as the primary abundant genera mesorhizobium and bradyrhizobium exhibited resistant and sensitive to silver respectively most dominant moderately abundant and rare genera were resistant to silver moreover among 19 detected potential pathogens legionella parachlamydia and aeromonas were sensitive to silver while pseudomonas and acinetobacter were resistant to silver furthermore a total of 48 args were detected and they exhibited similar distributions in both samples the total abundance of args in ag ss increased by 0 08 fold compared with that in ss with efflux pumps as the main resistance mechanisms this study highlights the different responses of abundant moderately abundant and rare taxa to silver and the occurrences of args confirming that ag ss was an effective disinfection strategy for biosafety protection of dhws keywords pipe wall biofilm silver loaded stainless steel antibacterial efficiency abundant and rare taxa antibiotic resistance genes 1 introduction domestic hot water system dhws is typically characterized with relatively high water temperature and long hydraulic retention time hrt resulting in the acceleration of disinfectant consumption which is more conducive to bacteria reproduction and biofilm formation 1 biofilm growing on the inner surfaces of the pipeline provides protection for the resident microbes against environmental stresses high shear water velocity and disinfectants moreover the exfoliated biofilm and the bacteria released from biofilm could lead to deterioration of water quality and increase of biosafety risks 2 thus it is of great significance to inhibit the biofilm formation in dhws residual disinfectant plays an important role in controlling the microbial contamination in drinking water distribution system dwds and the recommended dosage of residual chlorine is 0 3 4 0 mg l in china 3 however even high doses of residual chlorine could not completely inhibit microbial regrowth in dwds 4 and may produce harmful carcinogenic disinfection byproducts dbps which may be more severe in dhws due to the higher water temperature 5 similar dbps problems are also common in the use of chloramine and chlorine dioxide disinfectants despite the high efficiency of ultraviolet disinfection it cannot provide residual protection therefore it is necessary to innovate new approaches to solve the pipe wall biofilm contamination in dhws over the past few years the broad spectrum antibacterial properties of silver have received widespread attention the application of silver for water treatment mainly includes the following two ways directly use silver ions ag as disinfectant and load silver on the carrier as antibacterial material ag was suitable as secondary residual disinfectant 6 and it could effectively kill a population of 2 0 102 cfu ml escherichia coli e coli at a concentration of 4 ppb 7 the concentration of ag in water is strictly controlled 0 05 mg l due to its toxicity which limits the wide application of ag disinfection silver loaded material as an emerging disinfection strategy also exhibited great antibacterial performance a small amount of the silver nanoparticles agnps diatomite composite 0 5 g could kill 99 of e coli with an initial concentration of 2 96 105 cfu ml in 30 min 8 however porous and or granular materials are often applied as the medium to load silver such as activated carbon 9 and silica beads 10 while little research has been conducted on dense materials such as metal pipelines stainless steel ss pipe is widely used in dhws with the ability to absorb ag 11 which provides a new strategy for the biosafety protection of dhws the effects of agnps and ag on microbial communities in activated sludge 12 freshwater sediments 13 tap water and biofilm 14 have been extensively investigated to the best of our knowledge only a few studies have reported the effect of pipe materials 15 and disinfection methods 16 on biofilm bacterial communities in dhws the microbial communities consist of a large number of species which could be divided into different taxa based on the relative abundance of operational taxonomic units otus generally the otus with relative abundance 1 are regarded as abundant taxa 17 18 and the otus with thresholds of 0 1 or 0 01 are rare taxa 19 20 however current research mainly concentrated on the abundant taxa and neglected the rare taxa abundant and rare taxa may respond dissimilarly to variation of environmental conditions such as temperature salinity and oxygen content 20 thus far the impact of silver especially the silver loaded on pipeline on abundant moderately abundant and rare taxa of bacterial communities in dhws remains elusive moreover potential pathogens mainly belonging to moderately abundant or rare taxa may pose significant risks to public health 21 enteric pathogens were considered as the major pathogenic bacteria in drinking water 22 and many other kinds of potential pathogens e g pseudomonas aeruginosa and mycobacterium avium were also identified in dwds 23 however in addition to legionella 24 there are still knowledge gaps regarding the composition of other potential pathogens in dhws and their resistance to silver loaded pipeline antibiotic resistance genes args as emerging genotype pollutants have received extensive attention for they may cause serious environmental problems 25 various aquatic environments have been identified as the reservoir of args including surface water 26 underground water 27 wastewater 28 and drinking water 29 whereas few studies have been conducted on the args contamination in domestic hot water the transmission of args among microorganisms could be facilitated by mobile genetic elements 30 and potential pathogens that captured args through horizontal gene transfer may become superbugs 31 generally disinfection is considered as the crucial process to ensure the biosafety of drinking water which also affect the occurrence of args chlorine as the most widely utilized disinfectant could contribute to the enrichment of args 32 ozone remarkably increased the copy numbers of all observed ten sulfonamide and tetracycline args in seven drinking water treatment plants 33 the silver loaded pipeline may also exert selective pressure on the microorganisms until now whether the silver loaded pipeline could reduce the enrichment of args and its impact on the occurrence of args are largely unknown these issues are closely related to the biosafety of dhws and deserve further investigations in the present study the synthesized silver loaded stainless steel ag ss was applied in simulated dhws to control the biofilm contamination with ss as control the specific objectives were 1 to investigate the antibacterial properties of ag ss 2 to elucidate the responses of abundant moderately abundant and rare taxa to silver 3 to explore the composition of potential pathogens as well as their resistance and sensitivity to silver 4 to determine the distribution of args and their resistance mechanisms 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation and characterization of ag ss ag ss was synthesized following the procedure described in our previous study with some modifications 11 in brief a total of 18 pretreated 304 ss coupons 6 pieces as a group each piece in size of 145 0 11 5 mm were placed in three beakers containing 1 l silver nitrate solution 1 0 mg l the beakers were covered and placed in an incubator at 45 1 c for 96 h in the absence of light with agitation at 150 r min then the coupons were rinsed three times with ultra pure water produced by milli q water purification system millipore usa and air dried the ag concentration was measured using an atomic adsorption spectrophotometer aas vario6 analytik jena ag germany under the condition of air acetylene flame the surface morphology of ag ss and biofilm was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy sem su 8010 hitachi japan operating at coarse vacuum and the three dimensional structure of biofilm was visualized using image pro plus 6 0 based on sem the element content and silver distribution on ag ss were determined by energy dispersive spectrometer eds the surface charge of ag ss was measured by analyzing zeta potentials of ag ss solution at different ph values 2 0 8 0 adjusted by nitric acid and sodium bicarbonate on zeta potential analyzer nano z malvern england 2 2 antibacterial properties of ag ss the antibacterial properties of ag ss on biofilm formation were examined in biofilm annular reactor bar two bars r1 and r2 for ss and ag ss respectively were operated in parallel and each accommodated 18 removable coupons each bar contained an inner rotating drum operated at a rotational speed of 60 rpm which approximately corresponded to a shear stress of 0 08 n m2 the heated laboratory tap water 45 1 c was used as the influent of r1 and r2 with a flow rate of 3 33 ml min and relevant water quality parameters are shown in table 1 one coupon was removed from the bar periodically every 7 days for the first 35 days and every 15 days from 35 to 95 days and a total of 9 coupons were taken out for bacteria count experiment during the whole 95 day experimental period the biofilm was sampled by cotton swabs scraping and ultrasound treatment according to our previous study 16 then the traditional culture dependent method was used to count the bacteria heterotrophic plate counts were performed using standard spread plate technique on r2a agar 34 100 μl of each serial dilution was spread on plates and colonies were counted after seven days incubation at 22 1 c 35 e coli was enumerated using standard membrane filter technique 36 samples were filtered through 0 45 μm filters using a vacuum aspirator next the filters were transferred to the plates containing pre dried fuchsin basic sodium sulfite agar and incubated at 37 1 c for 24 h triplicate plates were used for each dilution of sample one way analysis of variance was conducted to compare the difference of bacteria counts between ss and ag ss with spss statistics 25 the difference with p value 0 05 was considered statistically significant the average bacteria counts per ml cfu ml were converted to bacteria counts per unit area cfu cm2 the antibacterial efficiency of ag ss was calculated by eq 1 1 antibacterial efficiency nss nag ss nss 100 where nss and nag ss were the number of bacteria in biofilms attached on ss and ag ss coupons respectively 2 3 dna extraction and illumina miseq sequencing at the end of experiments three coupons were removed from each bar three cotton swabs were used to scrape the biofilm from different positions of the coupons and then mixed them as a sample after collecting the biofilm samples of ss and ag ss the total genomic dna was extracted using e z n a soil dna kit omega usa according to the manufacturer s instructions and stored at 20 c until use illumina miseq sequencing was applied to investigate the bacterial community composition targeting hypervariable v3 v4 regions of bacterial 16s rrna gene both samples were amplified in triplicates after purification and quantification the three amplicons were normalized in equimolar amounts in the final mixture and then paired end sequenced on illumina miseq pe300 platform illumina usa in sangon biotech co ltd shanghai china all the high quality sequences were deposited in the sequence read archive sra at national center for biotechnology information ncbi under accession number prjna591694 2 4 bacterial communities functions and args analysis the 16s rrna gene sequences were further processed and analyzed using the quantitative insights into microbial ecology qiime pipeline package 37 the effective sequences of both samples were normalized at 67 000 for comparison at the same sequencing depth otus were clustered by setting a 0 03 distance limit the taxonomic classification of otus was performed using the ribosomal database project rdp version 2 12 classifier at a bootstrap cutoff of 80 38 subsequently the alpha diversity indices such as otu number chao 1 ace shannon index simpson index and good s coverage and the rarefaction curves were generated with mothur to evaluate the richness and diversity of bacterial communities venn analysis was conducted to depict the shared and unique otus of ss and ag ss samples venn analysis was conducted to depict the shared and unique otus of ss and ag ss samples according to previous publications 18 20 the bacteria were further classified into three ecological categories based on their relative abundances 1 abundant taxa genus with relative abundance 1 in a sample 2 moderately abundant taxa genus with relative abundance between 1 and 0 1 in a sample 3 rare taxa genus with relative abundance 0 1 in a sample moreover according to the virulence factor database vfdb http www mgc ac cn vfs 39 the potential pathogens were screened to investigate their distribution within total potential pathogens additionally the phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states picrust was applied to predict the bacterial functions 40 the output of picrust contained a table of kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg orthologs kos the args were selected based on the kos of args summarized in a previous study 41 to investigate their gene counts resistance mechanisms and distributions in ss and ag ss the weighted nearest sequenced taxon index nsti score was calculated to evaluate the accuracy of the metagenome prediction the differences in bacterial communities and functions between samples were assessed by fisher exact test 3 results and discussion 3 1 antibacterial properties and mechanisms the distribution of silver on ag ss surface was observed by sem before the antibacterial experiment the large depressions e g area 1 and cracks e g area 2 on ss surface adsorbed more silver than the smooth parts e g area 3 fig s1a eds analysis exhibited that area 1 area 2 and area 3 contained 10 6 wt 2 3 wt and 0 2 wt silver respectively supporting the results of sem fig s1b d the isoelectric ph of ag ss was about 2 5 and it was protonated and negatively charged below and above the isoelectric point respectively indicating that the surface of ag ss was negative charged in domestic hot water fig s1e the antibacterial properties of ag ss against heterotrophic bacteria and e coli were investigated over a period of 95 days with ss as control the number of heterotrophic bacteria on ss experienced a process from slowly increasing 0 35 days to rapidly increasing 35 80 days and reached a peak 6 15 105 cfu cm2 on the 80th day then decreased slightly fig 1 a the whole process was consistent with the multiple stages of biofilm development including initial attachment or adsorption to the surface irreversible attachment and first maturation 42 43 by contrast the heterotrophic bacteria counts on ag ss maintained at a low level during the whole experimental period 0 95 days the antibacterial efficiency of ag ss changed greatly in the early stage 0 35 days then gradually increased and reached stability within 80 95 days the great antibacterial properties of ag ss 70 60 13 22 led to a significantly lower p 0 05 number of heterotrophic bacteria on ag ss than that on ss at each sampling time as for e coli fig 1b its number on ss was low during 0 65 days then increased rapidly within 65 80 days and decreased substantially from 80 to 95 days the e coli on ag ss exhibited similar variation but its number was lower than that on ss the antibacterial efficiency fluctuated obviously but remained at a high level 73 56 10 62 throughout the experiment on the whole the number of heterotrophic bacteria and e coli on ag ss was lower than that on ss indicating that ag ss exhibited excellent antibacterial performance many agnps loaded materials have been proven to inhibit the biofilm formation and have a powerful cell killing effect 9 44 which is in good accordance with our research results moreover the biofilm morphology on ss and ag ss was analyzed by sem the dense biofilm structure on ss was observed from fig 2 a which is attributed to the fact that ss had no antibacterial effect and the suspended bacteria attached to its surface grew rapidly with time leading to the formation of biofilm in comparison the biofilm on ag ss was relatively loose with holes on the surface fig 2b furthermore the sem images were processed to qualitatively reflect the difference in the vertical direction of the biofilm between ss and ag ss as shown in fig 2c and d the biofilm image of ss was dominated by red area while the yellow and green regions accounted for a large proportion on ag ss which may indirectly reflect that the biofilm of ag ss was thinner than that of ss in general the biofilm on ag ss was looser and thinner than that on ss which supported the antibacterial effect of ag ss to some extent due to the intrinsic antibacterial property of silver ag released by the silver loaded materials was regarded as one of the main potential disinfection mechanisms 45 in order to explore the antibacterial mechanism of ag ss the concentration of ag in effluent was detected by aas the ag concentration in water was always below the detection limit 0 03 mg l throughout the experimental process indicating that ag was not leached or only released weakly from ag ss additionally the ag ss coupons were taken out from bar and analyzed again with sem at the end of the experiment the distribution of silver on ag ss was still clearly observed from fig 2e and f supporting the above results low concentration of ag 0 02 mg l had little inactivation effect on e coli and s aureus strains 46 so even if the possibility of ag release from ag ss existed in this study the contribution of ag to bacterial inactivation could be neglected the silver on the newly synthesized ag ss existed in the form of metallic silver according to our previous study 11 although it is unclear whether the form of silver on ag ss changed during the 95 day experiment both oxidized silver and metallic silver have antibacterial effects 47 so it is reasonable to infer that the bacteria were mainly inactivated by contact with the silver adsorbed on ss overall the synthesized ag ss exhibited excellent antibacterial performance with contact bacteriostasis as the antibacterial mechanism which is suitable for the application in dhws to ensure biosafety 3 2 shifts in bacterial diversity and community composition 3 2 1 bacterial diversity analysis at the end of the disinfection experiment illumina miseq sequencing was applied to investigate the biofilm bacterial diversity on ss and ag ss the sequences obtained could well represent the bacterial communities based on the high good s coverage values 99 rarefaction curves fig s2 of both samples arrived to plateau phase which also supported this result ag ss led to a slight decrease in bacterial richness as revealed by the chao 1 and ace indices table s1 while the shannon index of ag ss sample increased slightly compared with ss table s1 a plausible explanation was that the decrease in the relative abundance of dominant genera weakened the competition among other microorganisms 48 resulting a slightly higher diversity differently a previous study reported that agnps did not affect bacterial diversity 13 while another research suggested that the addition of silver had a negative effect on microbial diversity 49 the inconsistent effect of silver on microbial diversity may be related to the type and concentration of silver as well as the characteristics of bacterial community 3 2 2 bacterial community composition at phylum and class levels in this study 27 bacterial phyla were identified based on the effective sequences as shown in fig 3 a and b the top 12 phyla were investigated including more than 99 of the total sequences in each sample proteobacteria dominated absolutely in biofilm accounting for 93 29 and 89 54 of the total sequences in ss and ag ss respectively and it was also reported as one of the most abundant bacterial phyla in pipe wall biofilm of dwds 50 as the second largest phylum in ss 4 05 planctomycetes accounted for a low proportion in ag ss 1 12 bacteroidetes 0 17 1 73 firmicutes 0 09 1 60 and acidobacteria 0 08 0 97 exhibited a slightly higher proportion in ag ss than ss the relative abundance of bacteroidetes increased by 76 2 at exposure of 10 mg l agnps 51 supporting our research results firmicutes with thick cell membranes were highly resistant to a variety of environment challenges such as heat disinfectants and oxidizing agents 52 additionally some phyla with low relative abundances were identified in both samples actinobacteria euryarchaeota and chloroflexi showed higher relative abundance in ag ss while chlamydiae and deinococcus thermus were more abundant in ss at class level fig 3c the top three classes all belonged to proteobacteria alphaproteobacteria was the predominant class accounting for a higher proportion in ss 91 15 than ag ss 77 11 while betaproteobacteria and gammaproteobacteria showed higher relative abundance in ag ss planctomycetia as the main class of planctomycetes its proportion decreased from 4 00 in ss to 0 81 in ag ss which is consistent with the results obtained at phylum level other classes exhibited a low proportion in both samples such as verrucomicrobiae and deltaproteobacteria these results demonstrated that the silver on ag ss affected the distribution of bacteria in pipe wall biofilm moreover picrust was applied to predict the potential functions of bacterial communities based on kegg database the weighted nsti scores of samples ranged from 0 09 to 0 15 0 17 indicating the predict results provided accurate metagenome predictions 40 despite distinct shifts in bacterial communities were observed at phylum level there were not obvious variations in dominant bacterial functions at top level of pathways modules metabolism 48 24 49 02 environmental information processing 20 08 20 76 genetic information processing 11 83 12 13 cellular process 3 38 3 71 human diseases 1 41 1 48 and organismal systems 0 66 were identified as the major functions in both samples fig s3a and b the similar bacterial functions may be related to the functional redundancy of complex microbial communities 53 briones and raskin 2003 nevertheless some functions at subcategory within the main functional categories between ss and ag ss samples were significantly different p 0 05 such as one carbon pool by folate and oxidative phosphorylation in metabolism phosphotransferase system in environmental information processing non homologous end joining in genetic information processing and peroxisome in cellular processes fig s4 3 2 3 shifts in abundant moderately abundant and rare taxa in ss and ag ss venn analysis was applied to compare the similarity and difference of microbial community at genus level between ss and ag ss there were 586 otus observed in both samples and only 23 38 of them 137 otus were shared otus but accounted for 97 08 and 90 83 of the total sequences in ss and ag ss respectively fig 4 these results highlighted the lower diversity but more importance of shared otus and similar phenomenon was also observed in a previous study 54 in contrast the unique otus in ss 240 otus and ag ss 209 otus together accounted for 76 62 of the total observed otus but their corresponding abundances were very low the shifts in abundant moderately abundant and rare taxa of shared and unique otus in ss and ag ss were further investigated to elaborate their responses to silver for shared otus 15 33 34 31 and 50 36 of them belonged to abundant moderately abundant and rare taxa respectively in this study the increase and decrease in relative abundance of genera were used as indicators to evaluate bacterial resistance and sensitivity 12 55 among the abundant taxa mesorhizobium was the predominant genus which accounted for a significantly higher proportion p 0 05 fig s5 in ag ss 58 42 than ss 38 04 indicating that it was resistant to silver bradyrhizobium was identified as the major silver sensitive genus whose proportion in ag ss 0 22 were significantly lower than ss 24 57 p 0 05 fig s5 both mesorhizobium and bradyrhizobium belong to rhizobiales and were recognized as eps producers 56 58 the difference in their resistance and sensitivity to silver is probably due to the different types and contents of eps they produced the eps produced by mesorhizobium may be wrapped in its exterior to resist environmental interference leading to the resistance of mesorhizobium to silver bradyrhizobium has the ability to produce many soluble eps composed of acid hetero polysaccharides 80 90 59 while the soluble eps may not provide adequate protection resulting in its sensitivity to silver bosea belonged to the abundant and moderately abundant taxa in ss 14 22 and ag ss 0 12 respectively indicating that it was a silver sensitive genus while another study reported that bosea represented only a tiny portion of the biofilm communities with no significant changes in response to agnps 60 the inconsistent results may be attributed to the different silver forms and biofilm formation environments phreatobacter and phenylobacterium were abundant genera in both samples with higher relative abundance in ag ss and ss respectively delftia pseudomonas sphingomonas and acinetobacter also exhibited silver resistance which were abundant genera in ag ss but belonged to moderately abundant or rare taxa in ss illustrating that rare taxa may become more important abundant taxa in response to environmental stimulation 18 pseudomonas in biofilm were 300 times more tolerant to silver exposure than the planktonic counterparts 61 partially supporting the results of pseudomonas as silver resistant genus in this study sphingomonas take less restriction on living conditions and could grow in oligotrophic environments 62 which may be one of the reasons for its silver resistance as for moderately abundant taxa some of them were rare genera in ss such as gemmobacter rhodobacter methylobacterium and planctopirus fully reflecting their resistance to silver while other genera had similar abundance in both samples most of the rare genera accounted for a slightly higher proportion in ag ss than ss except for schlesneria and hydrogenophaga in general there were different silver resistance and sensitivity among genera the dissimilar responses of abundant moderately abundant and rare taxa to silver led to the differences in microbial communities between ss and ag ss for unique otus in ss sample only 13 5 42 of them belonged to moderately abundant taxa including hyphomicrobium 0 14 gemmata 0 13 elstera 0 12 and spartobacteria genera incertae sedis 0 12 hyphomicrobium maintained the decreasing trends with the increase of agnps concentration 54 indicating its sensitivity to silver which well explains why it was a unique genus in ss sample while 94 58 227 otus of unique otus in ss were categorized into numerous rare genera by comparison among the unique otus in ag ss 15 79 33 otus of them belonged to moderately abundant taxa e g luteimonas 0 61 gp4 0 35 haliscomenobacter 0 28 and chryseolinea 0 21 gp4 showed high tolerance to all tested forms of silver agnps and ag 12 supporting the results of our research whereas the remaining 84 21 176 otus of unique otus in ag ss were classified into rare taxa overall the classification of shared otus covered all abundant genera while most unique otus belonged to rare taxa the responses of abundant moderately abundant and rare taxa to silver were different 3 3 potential pathogens analysis here a total of 19 potential pathogenic bacteria were identified and their relative abundance within total potential pathogens was investigated fig 5 for ss sample legionella 31 31 was the dominant potential pathogens followed by pseudomonas 23 71 parachlamydia 12 46 aeromonas 10 33 neochlamydia 4 26 and acinetobacter 3 04 legionella is an aquatic and ubiquitous gram negative bacterium some species of which are common potential pathogens that may cause severe legionnaires disease pneumonia like illness 24 legionella could grow in a temperature range of 5 63 c and was frequently detected in hot water plumbing systems and cooling towers 24 which well explains its dominant position in ss sample it is remarkable that the relative abundance of legionella decreased obviously in ag ss 0 13 indicating that ag ss greatly inhibited its growth which is of great significance for reducing the pathogenic risk in dhws additionally the parachlamydia aeromonas and neochlamydia were also the main silver sensitive genera whose relative abundance decreased obviously in ag ss compared with ss sample in comparison pseudomonas and acinetobacter were identified as the major silver resistant potential pathogens in this study accounting for a higher proportion in ag ss than ss which is consistent with the results of other research 12 as for low abundant potential pathogenic bacteria coxiella and enterococcus both accounted for 0 61 in ss while neither were detected in ag ss indicating that their growth was completely inhibited by silver mycobacterium exhibited sensitivity to silver and its relative abundance decreased from 1 52 in ss to 0 57 in ag ss which may reduce the risk of cutaneous infections caused by the related sequences such as mycobacterium frederiksbergense 63 since the functional category of human diseases was closely related to the biosafety of dhws further investigated had been carried out the total counts of human diseases in ag ss 1855795 was slightly lower than that in ss 1982003 indicating that silver may play an inhibitory role on potential pathogenic bacteria and reduce the risk of human diseases transmission the top 15 bacterial functions at functional subcategory are shown in fig 5b accounting for 86 20 86 92 of human diseases in both samples tuberculosis huntington s disease alzheimer s disease parkinson s disease and pathways in cancer were the main pathways in this study and similar disease types were also detected in secondary water supply system 64 the close proportion between ss and ag ss samples suggested that the effect of silver on bacterial functions distribution within human diseases was not obvious overall ag ss was helpful to ensure the biosafety of dhws due to its inhibitory effect on some dominant potential pathogens 3 4 args analysis the occurrence of predicted args in ss and ag ss samples was further investigated a total of 48 args were detected in both samples and the gene counts of args in ag ss were slightly higher increased by 0 08 fold than that in ss fig 6 a suggesting that silver have the potential to cause a slight accumulation of args extracellular stress could promote the replication of plasmids in bacterial cells 65 so the silver on ag ss may increase the copy number of plasmids in viable bacterial cells resulting in the slightly higher gene counts of args in ag ss than ss chlorination of drinking water increased the abundance of mexf blatem aph33ib and cml e3 by 106 0 fold 10 3 fold 10 3 fold and 8 5 fold respectively 66 thus compared with traditional chlorine disinfection ag ss obviously reduced the enrichment of args these args were classified into three major resistance mechanisms with close proportion in both samples antibiotic deactivation 20 93 in ss and 21 77 in ag ss cellular protection 20 06 in ss and 20 67 in ag ss and efflux pumps 59 01 in ss and 57 55 in ag ss fig 6b efflux pumps as the most important resistance mechanisms in this study were also identified in other types of samples such as soil 67 multidrug efflux pumps may mediate the bacterial co resistance between disinfectants and antibiotics 68 the predicted args potentially confer resistance to different classes of antibiotics mainly mlsb macrolide lincosamide streptogramin b 20 58 followed by fca fluoroquinolone quinolone florfenicol chloramphenicol and amphenicol 14 98 beta lactam 14 73 tetracycline 5 47 vancomycin 3 29 and aminoglycoside 2 40 fig 6c while there were still 38 55 of args conferring resistance to other or efflux antibiotics the distribution of args subtypes was further explored by heatmap analysis fig 6c five genes that encode for aminoglycoside resistance were observed and all of them were more abundant in ag ss than ss with aaca aphd as the most dominant gene for beta lactam args ampc dominated in biofilm of ss and was frequently detected in drinking water 66 while cfxa pbp2x and pena were more abundant in ag ss compared with ss among the seven genes conferring resistance to fca the gene counts of emrb qaca adea and catb3 were higher than the other four genes qepa basr oprj and yidy mdtl the ermk mphb and mdta genes were the main args for mlsb and the other three genes including mefa erea and erm had low gene counts only one args subtype for tetracycline was obtained teta and it was more abundant in ag ss than ss indicating that silver had a slight enrichment effect on teta but not as obvious as chlorination 66 the vanyb was the dominant args subtype for vancomycin followed by vanxb and vrar for some other antibiotics 22 args were obtained and the gene counts of bcr tcab ttga tc mate marc putitive multidrug tc smr3 marr and catb8 were higher than the other args subtypes on the whole the total gene counts of args were slightly higher in ag ss than ss and the predicted args had similar dominant subtypes but different distribution in both samples 4 conclusions the synthesized ag ss exhibited excellent antibacterial performance with contact bacteriostasis as the antibacterial mechanism compared with ss the microbial community of ag ss showed higher diversity and lower richness the silver on ag ss affected the distribution of bacterial communities and the responses of abundant moderately abundant and rare taxa to silver were different moreover a total of 19 potential pathogens were identified with legionella parachlamydia and aeromonas as the predominant silver sensitive genera the predicted 48 args of ss and ag ss mainly confer resistance to mlsb fca and beta lactam with efflux

13632,silver loaded stainless steel ag ss was applied in domestic hot water system dhws to control the biofilm contamination the antibacterial properties of ag ss as well as the bacterial communities potential pathogens and antibiotic resistance genes args of pipe wall biofilm were investigated with ss as control ag ss maintained a high antibacterial efficiency on heterotrophic bacteria 70 60 13 22 and escherichia coli 73 56 10 62 by contact bacteriostasis dominant phyla exhibited a lower relative abundance in ag ss than ss the bacteria were further classified into abundant 1 moderately abundant 0 1 1 and rare 0 1 taxa to investigate their responses to silver there were 15 33 of shared operational taxonomic units otus belonged to abundant taxa while most unique otus 80 of each sample were identified as rare taxa as the primary abundant genera mesorhizobium and bradyrhizobium exhibited resistant and sensitive to silver respectively most dominant moderately abundant and rare genera were resistant to silver moreover among 19 detected potential pathogens legionella parachlamydia and aeromonas were sensitive to silver while pseudomonas and acinetobacter were resistant to silver furthermore a total of 48 args were detected and they exhibited similar distributions in both samples the total abundance of args in ag ss increased by 0 08 fold compared with that in ss with efflux pumps as the main resistance mechanisms this study highlights the different responses of abundant moderately abundant and rare taxa to silver and the occurrences of args confirming that ag ss was an effective disinfection strategy for biosafety protection of dhws keywords pipe wall biofilm silver loaded stainless steel antibacterial efficiency abundant and rare taxa antibiotic resistance genes 1 introduction domestic hot water system dhws is typically characterized with relatively high water temperature and long hydraulic retention time hrt resulting in the acceleration of disinfectant consumption which is more conducive to bacteria reproduction and biofilm formation 1 biofilm growing on the inner surfaces of the pipeline provides protection for the resident microbes against environmental stresses high shear water velocity and disinfectants moreover the exfoliated biofilm and the bacteria released from biofilm could lead to deterioration of water quality and increase of biosafety risks 2 thus it is of great significance to inhibit the biofilm formation in dhws residual disinfectant plays an important role in controlling the microbial contamination in drinking water distribution system dwds and the recommended dosage of residual chlorine is 0 3 4 0 mg l in china 3 however even high doses of residual chlorine could not completely inhibit microbial regrowth in dwds 4 and may produce harmful carcinogenic disinfection byproducts dbps which may be more severe in dhws due to the higher water temperature 5 similar dbps problems are also common in the use of chloramine and chlorine dioxide disinfectants despite the high efficiency of ultraviolet disinfection it cannot provide residual protection therefore it is necessary to innovate new approaches to solve the pipe wall biofilm contamination in dhws over the past few years the broad spectrum antibacterial properties of silver have received widespread attention the application of silver for water treatment mainly includes the following two ways directly use silver ions ag as disinfectant and load silver on the carrier as antibacterial material ag was suitable as secondary residual disinfectant 6 and it could effectively kill a population of 2 0 102 cfu ml escherichia coli e coli at a concentration of 4 ppb 7 the concentration of ag in water is strictly controlled 0 05 mg l due to its toxicity which limits the wide application of ag disinfection silver loaded material as an emerging disinfection strategy also exhibited great antibacterial performance a small amount of the silver nanoparticles agnps diatomite composite 0 5 g could kill 99 of e coli with an initial concentration of 2 96 105 cfu ml in 30 min 8 however porous and or granular materials are often applied as the medium to load silver such as activated carbon 9 and silica beads 10 while little research has been conducted on dense materials such as metal pipelines stainless steel ss pipe is widely used in dhws with the ability to absorb ag 11 which provides a new strategy for the biosafety protection of dhws the effects of agnps and ag on microbial communities in activated sludge 12 freshwater sediments 13 tap water and biofilm 14 have been extensively investigated to the best of our knowledge only a few studies have reported the effect of pipe materials 15 and disinfection methods 16 on biofilm bacterial communities in dhws the microbial communities consist of a large number of species which could be divided into different taxa based on the relative abundance of operational taxonomic units otus generally the otus with relative abundance 1 are regarded as abundant taxa 17 18 and the otus with thresholds of 0 1 or 0 01 are rare taxa 19 20 however current research mainly concentrated on the abundant taxa and neglected the rare taxa abundant and rare taxa may respond dissimilarly to variation of environmental conditions such as temperature salinity and oxygen content 20 thus far the impact of silver especially the silver loaded on pipeline on abundant moderately abundant and rare taxa of bacterial communities in dhws remains elusive moreover potential pathogens mainly belonging to moderately abundant or rare taxa may pose significant risks to public health 21 enteric pathogens were considered as the major pathogenic bacteria in drinking water 22 and many other kinds of potential pathogens e g pseudomonas aeruginosa and mycobacterium avium were also identified in dwds 23 however in addition to legionella 24 there are still knowledge gaps regarding the composition of other potential pathogens in dhws and their resistance to silver loaded pipeline antibiotic resistance genes args as emerging genotype pollutants have received extensive attention for they may cause serious environmental problems 25 various aquatic environments have been identified as the reservoir of args including surface water 26 underground water 27 wastewater 28 and drinking water 29 whereas few studies have been conducted on the args contamination in domestic hot water the transmission of args among microorganisms could be facilitated by mobile genetic elements 30 and potential pathogens that captured args through horizontal gene transfer may become superbugs 31 generally disinfection is considered as the crucial process to ensure the biosafety of drinking water which also affect the occurrence of args chlorine as the most widely utilized disinfectant could contribute to the enrichment of args 32 ozone remarkably increased the copy numbers of all observed ten sulfonamide and tetracycline args in seven drinking water treatment plants 33 the silver loaded pipeline may also exert selective pressure on the microorganisms until now whether the silver loaded pipeline could reduce the enrichment of args and its impact on the occurrence of args are largely unknown these issues are closely related to the biosafety of dhws and deserve further investigations in the present study the synthesized silver loaded stainless steel ag ss was applied in simulated dhws to control the biofilm contamination with ss as control the specific objectives were 1 to investigate the antibacterial properties of ag ss 2 to elucidate the responses of abundant moderately abundant and rare taxa to silver 3 to explore the composition of potential pathogens as well as their resistance and sensitivity to silver 4 to determine the distribution of args and their resistance mechanisms 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation and characterization of ag ss ag ss was synthesized following the procedure described in our previous study with some modifications 11 in brief a total of 18 pretreated 304 ss coupons 6 pieces as a group each piece in size of 145 0 11 5 mm were placed in three beakers containing 1 l silver nitrate solution 1 0 mg l the beakers were covered and placed in an incubator at 45 1 c for 96 h in the absence of light with agitation at 150 r min then the coupons were rinsed three times with ultra pure water produced by milli q water purification system millipore usa and air dried the ag concentration was measured using an atomic adsorption spectrophotometer aas vario6 analytik jena ag germany under the condition of air acetylene flame the surface morphology of ag ss and biofilm was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy sem su 8010 hitachi japan operating at coarse vacuum and the three dimensional structure of biofilm was visualized using image pro plus 6 0 based on sem the element content and silver distribution on ag ss were determined by energy dispersive spectrometer eds the surface charge of ag ss was measured by analyzing zeta potentials of ag ss solution at different ph values 2 0 8 0 adjusted by nitric acid and sodium bicarbonate on zeta potential analyzer nano z malvern england 2 2 antibacterial properties of ag ss the antibacterial properties of ag ss on biofilm formation were examined in biofilm annular reactor bar two bars r1 and r2 for ss and ag ss respectively were operated in parallel and each accommodated 18 removable coupons each bar contained an inner rotating drum operated at a rotational speed of 60 rpm which approximately corresponded to a shear stress of 0 08 n m2 the heated laboratory tap water 45 1 c was used as the influent of r1 and r2 with a flow rate of 3 33 ml min and relevant water quality parameters are shown in table 1 one coupon was removed from the bar periodically every 7 days for the first 35 days and every 15 days from 35 to 95 days and a total of 9 coupons were taken out for bacteria count experiment during the whole 95 day experimental period the biofilm was sampled by cotton swabs scraping and ultrasound treatment according to our previous study 16 then the traditional culture dependent method was used to count the bacteria heterotrophic plate counts were performed using standard spread plate technique on r2a agar 34 100 μl of each serial dilution was spread on plates and colonies were counted after seven days incubation at 22 1 c 35 e coli was enumerated using standard membrane filter technique 36 samples were filtered through 0 45 μm filters using a vacuum aspirator next the filters were transferred to the plates containing pre dried fuchsin basic sodium sulfite agar and incubated at 37 1 c for 24 h triplicate plates were used for each dilution of sample one way analysis of variance was conducted to compare the difference of bacteria counts between ss and ag ss with spss statistics 25 the difference with p value 0 05 was considered statistically significant the average bacteria counts per ml cfu ml were converted to bacteria counts per unit area cfu cm2 the antibacterial efficiency of ag ss was calculated by eq 1 1 antibacterial efficiency nss nag ss nss 100 where nss and nag ss were the number of bacteria in biofilms attached on ss and ag ss coupons respectively 2 3 dna extraction and illumina miseq sequencing at the end of experiments three coupons were removed from each bar three cotton swabs were used to scrape the biofilm from different positions of the coupons and then mixed them as a sample after collecting the biofilm samples of ss and ag ss the total genomic dna was extracted using e z n a soil dna kit omega usa according to the manufacturer s instructions and stored at 20 c until use illumina miseq sequencing was applied to investigate the bacterial community composition targeting hypervariable v3 v4 regions of bacterial 16s rrna gene both samples were amplified in triplicates after purification and quantification the three amplicons were normalized in equimolar amounts in the final mixture and then paired end sequenced on illumina miseq pe300 platform illumina usa in sangon biotech co ltd shanghai china all the high quality sequences were deposited in the sequence read archive sra at national center for biotechnology information ncbi under accession number prjna591694 2 4 bacterial communities functions and args analysis the 16s rrna gene sequences were further processed and analyzed using the quantitative insights into microbial ecology qiime pipeline package 37 the effective sequences of both samples were normalized at 67 000 for comparison at the same sequencing depth otus were clustered by setting a 0 03 distance limit the taxonomic classification of otus was performed using the ribosomal database project rdp version 2 12 classifier at a bootstrap cutoff of 80 38 subsequently the alpha diversity indices such as otu number chao 1 ace shannon index simpson index and good s coverage and the rarefaction curves were generated with mothur to evaluate the richness and diversity of bacterial communities venn analysis was conducted to depict the shared and unique otus of ss and ag ss samples venn analysis was conducted to depict the shared and unique otus of ss and ag ss samples according to previous publications 18 20 the bacteria were further classified into three ecological categories based on their relative abundances 1 abundant taxa genus with relative abundance 1 in a sample 2 moderately abundant taxa genus with relative abundance between 1 and 0 1 in a sample 3 rare taxa genus with relative abundance 0 1 in a sample moreover according to the virulence factor database vfdb http www mgc ac cn vfs 39 the potential pathogens were screened to investigate their distribution within total potential pathogens additionally the phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states picrust was applied to predict the bacterial functions 40 the output of picrust contained a table of kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg orthologs kos the args were selected based on the kos of args summarized in a previous study 41 to investigate their gene counts resistance mechanisms and distributions in ss and ag ss the weighted nearest sequenced taxon index nsti score was calculated to evaluate the accuracy of the metagenome prediction the differences in bacterial communities and functions between samples were assessed by fisher exact test 3 results and discussion 3 1 antibacterial properties and mechanisms the distribution of silver on ag ss surface was observed by sem before the antibacterial experiment the large depressions e g area 1 and cracks e g area 2 on ss surface adsorbed more silver than the smooth parts e g area 3 fig s1a eds analysis exhibited that area 1 area 2 and area 3 contained 10 6 wt 2 3 wt and 0 2 wt silver respectively supporting the results of sem fig s1b d the isoelectric ph of ag ss was about 2 5 and it was protonated and negatively charged below and above the isoelectric point respectively indicating that the surface of ag ss was negative charged in domestic hot water fig s1e the antibacterial properties of ag ss against heterotrophic bacteria and e coli were investigated over a period of 95 days with ss as control the number of heterotrophic bacteria on ss experienced a process from slowly increasing 0 35 days to rapidly increasing 35 80 days and reached a peak 6 15 105 cfu cm2 on the 80th day then decreased slightly fig 1 a the whole process was consistent with the multiple stages of biofilm development including initial attachment or adsorption to the surface irreversible attachment and first maturation 42 43 by contrast the heterotrophic bacteria counts on ag ss maintained at a low level during the whole experimental period 0 95 days the antibacterial efficiency of ag ss changed greatly in the early stage 0 35 days then gradually increased and reached stability within 80 95 days the great antibacterial properties of ag ss 70 60 13 22 led to a significantly lower p 0 05 number of heterotrophic bacteria on ag ss than that on ss at each sampling time as for e coli fig 1b its number on ss was low during 0 65 days then increased rapidly within 65 80 days and decreased substantially from 80 to 95 days the e coli on ag ss exhibited similar variation but its number was lower than that on ss the antibacterial efficiency fluctuated obviously but remained at a high level 73 56 10 62 throughout the experiment on the whole the number of heterotrophic bacteria and e coli on ag ss was lower than that on ss indicating that ag ss exhibited excellent antibacterial performance many agnps loaded materials have been proven to inhibit the biofilm formation and have a powerful cell killing effect 9 44 which is in good accordance with our research results moreover the biofilm morphology on ss and ag ss was analyzed by sem the dense biofilm structure on ss was observed from fig 2 a which is attributed to the fact that ss had no antibacterial effect and the suspended bacteria attached to its surface grew rapidly with time leading to the formation of biofilm in comparison the biofilm on ag ss was relatively loose with holes on the surface fig 2b furthermore the sem images were processed to qualitatively reflect the difference in the vertical direction of the biofilm between ss and ag ss as shown in fig 2c and d the biofilm image of ss was dominated by red area while the yellow and green regions accounted for a large proportion on ag ss which may indirectly reflect that the biofilm of ag ss was thinner than that of ss in general the biofilm on ag ss was looser and thinner than that on ss which supported the antibacterial effect of ag ss to some extent due to the intrinsic antibacterial property of silver ag released by the silver loaded materials was regarded as one of the main potential disinfection mechanisms 45 in order to explore the antibacterial mechanism of ag ss the concentration of ag in effluent was detected by aas the ag concentration in water was always below the detection limit 0 03 mg l throughout the experimental process indicating that ag was not leached or only released weakly from ag ss additionally the ag ss coupons were taken out from bar and analyzed again with sem at the end of the experiment the distribution of silver on ag ss was still clearly observed from fig 2e and f supporting the above results low concentration of ag 0 02 mg l had little inactivation effect on e coli and s aureus strains 46 so even if the possibility of ag release from ag ss existed in this study the contribution of ag to bacterial inactivation could be neglected the silver on the newly synthesized ag ss existed in the form of metallic silver according to our previous study 11 although it is unclear whether the form of silver on ag ss changed during the 95 day experiment both oxidized silver and metallic silver have antibacterial effects 47 so it is reasonable to infer that the bacteria were mainly inactivated by contact with the silver adsorbed on ss overall the synthesized ag ss exhibited excellent antibacterial performance with contact bacteriostasis as the antibacterial mechanism which is suitable for the application in dhws to ensure biosafety 3 2 shifts in bacterial diversity and community composition 3 2 1 bacterial diversity analysis at the end of the disinfection experiment illumina miseq sequencing was applied to investigate the biofilm bacterial diversity on ss and ag ss the sequences obtained could well represent the bacterial communities based on the high good s coverage values 99 rarefaction curves fig s2 of both samples arrived to plateau phase which also supported this result ag ss led to a slight decrease in bacterial richness as revealed by the chao 1 and ace indices table s1 while the shannon index of ag ss sample increased slightly compared with ss table s1 a plausible explanation was that the decrease in the relative abundance of dominant genera weakened the competition among other microorganisms 48 resulting a slightly higher diversity differently a previous study reported that agnps did not affect bacterial diversity 13 while another research suggested that the addition of silver had a negative effect on microbial diversity 49 the inconsistent effect of silver on microbial diversity may be related to the type and concentration of silver as well as the characteristics of bacterial community 3 2 2 bacterial community composition at phylum and class levels in this study 27 bacterial phyla were identified based on the effective sequences as shown in fig 3 a and b the top 12 phyla were investigated including more than 99 of the total sequences in each sample proteobacteria dominated absolutely in biofilm accounting for 93 29 and 89 54 of the total sequences in ss and ag ss respectively and it was also reported as one of the most abundant bacterial phyla in pipe wall biofilm of dwds 50 as the second largest phylum in ss 4 05 planctomycetes accounted for a low proportion in ag ss 1 12 bacteroidetes 0 17 1 73 firmicutes 0 09 1 60 and acidobacteria 0 08 0 97 exhibited a slightly higher proportion in ag ss than ss the relative abundance of bacteroidetes increased by 76 2 at exposure of 10 mg l agnps 51 supporting our research results firmicutes with thick cell membranes were highly resistant to a variety of environment challenges such as heat disinfectants and oxidizing agents 52 additionally some phyla with low relative abundances were identified in both samples actinobacteria euryarchaeota and chloroflexi showed higher relative abundance in ag ss while chlamydiae and deinococcus thermus were more abundant in ss at class level fig 3c the top three classes all belonged to proteobacteria alphaproteobacteria was the predominant class accounting for a higher proportion in ss 91 15 than ag ss 77 11 while betaproteobacteria and gammaproteobacteria showed higher relative abundance in ag ss planctomycetia as the main class of planctomycetes its proportion decreased from 4 00 in ss to 0 81 in ag ss which is consistent with the results obtained at phylum level other classes exhibited a low proportion in both samples such as verrucomicrobiae and deltaproteobacteria these results demonstrated that the silver on ag ss affected the distribution of bacteria in pipe wall biofilm moreover picrust was applied to predict the potential functions of bacterial communities based on kegg database the weighted nsti scores of samples ranged from 0 09 to 0 15 0 17 indicating the predict results provided accurate metagenome predictions 40 despite distinct shifts in bacterial communities were observed at phylum level there were not obvious variations in dominant bacterial functions at top level of pathways modules metabolism 48 24 49 02 environmental information processing 20 08 20 76 genetic information processing 11 83 12 13 cellular process 3 38 3 71 human diseases 1 41 1 48 and organismal systems 0 66 were identified as the major functions in both samples fig s3a and b the similar bacterial functions may be related to the functional redundancy of complex microbial communities 53 briones and raskin 2003 nevertheless some functions at subcategory within the main functional categories between ss and ag ss samples were significantly different p 0 05 such as one carbon pool by folate and oxidative phosphorylation in metabolism phosphotransferase system in environmental information processing non homologous end joining in genetic information processing and peroxisome in cellular processes fig s4 3 2 3 shifts in abundant moderately abundant and rare taxa in ss and ag ss venn analysis was applied to compare the similarity and difference of microbial community at genus level between ss and ag ss there were 586 otus observed in both samples and only 23 38 of them 137 otus were shared otus but accounted for 97 08 and 90 83 of the total sequences in ss and ag ss respectively fig 4 these results highlighted the lower diversity but more importance of shared otus and similar phenomenon was also observed in a previous study 54 in contrast the unique otus in ss 240 otus and ag ss 209 otus together accounted for 76 62 of the total observed otus but their corresponding abundances were very low the shifts in abundant moderately abundant and rare taxa of shared and unique otus in ss and ag ss were further investigated to elaborate their responses to silver for shared otus 15 33 34 31 and 50 36 of them belonged to abundant moderately abundant and rare taxa respectively in this study the increase and decrease in relative abundance of genera were used as indicators to evaluate bacterial resistance and sensitivity 12 55 among the abundant taxa mesorhizobium was the predominant genus which accounted for a significantly higher proportion p 0 05 fig s5 in ag ss 58 42 than ss 38 04 indicating that it was resistant to silver bradyrhizobium was identified as the major silver sensitive genus whose proportion in ag ss 0 22 were significantly lower than ss 24 57 p 0 05 fig s5 both mesorhizobium and bradyrhizobium belong to rhizobiales and were recognized as eps producers 56 58 the difference in their resistance and sensitivity to silver is probably due to the different types and contents of eps they produced the eps produced by mesorhizobium may be wrapped in its exterior to resist environmental interference leading to the resistance of mesorhizobium to silver bradyrhizobium has the ability to produce many soluble eps composed of acid hetero polysaccharides 80 90 59 while the soluble eps may not provide adequate protection resulting in its sensitivity to silver bosea belonged to the abundant and moderately abundant taxa in ss 14 22 and ag ss 0 12 respectively indicating that it was a silver sensitive genus while another study reported that bosea represented only a tiny portion of the biofilm communities with no significant changes in response to agnps 60 the inconsistent results may be attributed to the different silver forms and biofilm formation environments phreatobacter and phenylobacterium were abundant genera in both samples with higher relative abundance in ag ss and ss respectively delftia pseudomonas sphingomonas and acinetobacter also exhibited silver resistance which were abundant genera in ag ss but belonged to moderately abundant or rare taxa in ss illustrating that rare taxa may become more important abundant taxa in response to environmental stimulation 18 pseudomonas in biofilm were 300 times more tolerant to silver exposure than the planktonic counterparts 61 partially supporting the results of pseudomonas as silver resistant genus in this study sphingomonas take less restriction on living conditions and could grow in oligotrophic environments 62 which may be one of the reasons for its silver resistance as for moderately abundant taxa some of them were rare genera in ss such as gemmobacter rhodobacter methylobacterium and planctopirus fully reflecting their resistance to silver while other genera had similar abundance in both samples most of the rare genera accounted for a slightly higher proportion in ag ss than ss except for schlesneria and hydrogenophaga in general there were different silver resistance and sensitivity among genera the dissimilar responses of abundant moderately abundant and rare taxa to silver led to the differences in microbial communities between ss and ag ss for unique otus in ss sample only 13 5 42 of them belonged to moderately abundant taxa including hyphomicrobium 0 14 gemmata 0 13 elstera 0 12 and spartobacteria genera incertae sedis 0 12 hyphomicrobium maintained the decreasing trends with the increase of agnps concentration 54 indicating its sensitivity to silver which well explains why it was a unique genus in ss sample while 94 58 227 otus of unique otus in ss were categorized into numerous rare genera by comparison among the unique otus in ag ss 15 79 33 otus of them belonged to moderately abundant taxa e g luteimonas 0 61 gp4 0 35 haliscomenobacter 0 28 and chryseolinea 0 21 gp4 showed high tolerance to all tested forms of silver agnps and ag 12 supporting the results of our research whereas the remaining 84 21 176 otus of unique otus in ag ss were classified into rare taxa overall the classification of shared otus covered all abundant genera while most unique otus belonged to rare taxa the responses of abundant moderately abundant and rare taxa to silver were different 3 3 potential pathogens analysis here a total of 19 potential pathogenic bacteria were identified and their relative abundance within total potential pathogens was investigated fig 5 for ss sample legionella 31 31 was the dominant potential pathogens followed by pseudomonas 23 71 parachlamydia 12 46 aeromonas 10 33 neochlamydia 4 26 and acinetobacter 3 04 legionella is an aquatic and ubiquitous gram negative bacterium some species of which are common potential pathogens that may cause severe legionnaires disease pneumonia like illness 24 legionella could grow in a temperature range of 5 63 c and was frequently detected in hot water plumbing systems and cooling towers 24 which well explains its dominant position in ss sample it is remarkable that the relative abundance of legionella decreased obviously in ag ss 0 13 indicating that ag ss greatly inhibited its growth which is of great significance for reducing the pathogenic risk in dhws additionally the parachlamydia aeromonas and neochlamydia were also the main silver sensitive genera whose relative abundance decreased obviously in ag ss compared with ss sample in comparison pseudomonas and acinetobacter were identified as the major silver resistant potential pathogens in this study accounting for a higher proportion in ag ss than ss which is consistent with the results of other research 12 as for low abundant potential pathogenic bacteria coxiella and enterococcus both accounted for 0 61 in ss while neither were detected in ag ss indicating that their growth was completely inhibited by silver mycobacterium exhibited sensitivity to silver and its relative abundance decreased from 1 52 in ss to 0 57 in ag ss which may reduce the risk of cutaneous infections caused by the related sequences such as mycobacterium frederiksbergense 63 since the functional category of human diseases was closely related to the biosafety of dhws further investigated had been carried out the total counts of human diseases in ag ss 1855795 was slightly lower than that in ss 1982003 indicating that silver may play an inhibitory role on potential pathogenic bacteria and reduce the risk of human diseases transmission the top 15 bacterial functions at functional subcategory are shown in fig 5b accounting for 86 20 86 92 of human diseases in both samples tuberculosis huntington s disease alzheimer s disease parkinson s disease and pathways in cancer were the main pathways in this study and similar disease types were also detected in secondary water supply system 64 the close proportion between ss and ag ss samples suggested that the effect of silver on bacterial functions distribution within human diseases was not obvious overall ag ss was helpful to ensure the biosafety of dhws due to its inhibitory effect on some dominant potential pathogens 3 4 args analysis the occurrence of predicted args in ss and ag ss samples was further investigated a total of 48 args were detected in both samples and the gene counts of args in ag ss were slightly higher increased by 0 08 fold than that in ss fig 6 a suggesting that silver have the potential to cause a slight accumulation of args extracellular stress could promote the replication of plasmids in bacterial cells 65 so the silver on ag ss may increase the copy number of plasmids in viable bacterial cells resulting in the slightly higher gene counts of args in ag ss than ss chlorination of drinking water increased the abundance of mexf blatem aph33ib and cml e3 by 106 0 fold 10 3 fold 10 3 fold and 8 5 fold respectively 66 thus compared with traditional chlorine disinfection ag ss obviously reduced the enrichment of args these args were classified into three major resistance mechanisms with close proportion in both samples antibiotic deactivation 20 93 in ss and 21 77 in ag ss cellular protection 20 06 in ss and 20 67 in ag ss and efflux pumps 59 01 in ss and 57 55 in ag ss fig 6b efflux pumps as the most important resistance mechanisms in this study were also identified in other types of samples such as soil 67 multidrug efflux pumps may mediate the bacterial co resistance between disinfectants and antibiotics 68 the predicted args potentially confer resistance to different classes of antibiotics mainly mlsb macrolide lincosamide streptogramin b 20 58 followed by fca fluoroquinolone quinolone florfenicol chloramphenicol and amphenicol 14 98 beta lactam 14 73 tetracycline 5 47 vancomycin 3 29 and aminoglycoside 2 40 fig 6c while there were still 38 55 of args conferring resistance to other or efflux antibiotics the distribution of args subtypes was further explored by heatmap analysis fig 6c five genes that encode for aminoglycoside resistance were observed and all of them were more abundant in ag ss than ss with aaca aphd as the most dominant gene for beta lactam args ampc dominated in biofilm of ss and was frequently detected in drinking water 66 while cfxa pbp2x and pena were more abundant in ag ss compared with ss among the seven genes conferring resistance to fca the gene counts of emrb qaca adea and catb3 were higher than the other four genes qepa basr oprj and yidy mdtl the ermk mphb and mdta genes were the main args for mlsb and the other three genes including mefa erea and erm had low gene counts only one args subtype for tetracycline was obtained teta and it was more abundant in ag ss than ss indicating that silver had a slight enrichment effect on teta but not as obvious as chlorination 66 the vanyb was the dominant args subtype for vancomycin followed by vanxb and vrar for some other antibiotics 22 args were obtained and the gene counts of bcr tcab ttga tc mate marc putitive multidrug tc smr3 marr and catb8 were higher than the other args subtypes on the whole the total gene counts of args were slightly higher in ag ss than ss and the predicted args had similar dominant subtypes but different distribution in both samples 4 conclusions the synthesized ag ss exhibited excellent antibacterial performance with contact bacteriostasis as the antibacterial mechanism compared with ss the microbial community of ag ss showed higher diversity and lower richness the silver on ag ss affected the distribution of bacterial communities and the responses of abundant moderately abundant and rare taxa to silver were different moreover a total of 19 potential pathogens were identified with legionella parachlamydia and aeromonas as the predominant silver sensitive genera the predicted 48 args of ss and ag ss mainly confer resistance to mlsb fca and beta lactam with efflux pumps as the main antibiotic resistance mechanisms the antibacterial property of ag ss is beneficial to ensure the biosafety of dhws declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

13633,the generation process for the highly reductive carbon dioxide radical co2 in the fe iii oxalate system is enhanced under uv irradiation and used in nitrate no3 reduction with improved product selectivity to nitrogen n2 the combination of fe iii and residual oxalate forms fe iii oxalate complexes again for an fe ii fe iii species cycle and achieves generation of co2 radical continually the electron paramagnetic resonance epr spectrum demonstrates the existence of co2 radicals in this process some of the important control factors such as initial concentrations of ferric ions fe iii 0 5 1 2 and 3 mm no3 14 21 and 42 mg n l oxalate 3 7 and 10 mm and ph values 2 3 4 5 and 6 are systematically assessed for no3 reduction efficiency and n species selectivity among all the control factors mentioned ph is a key parameter with an important role in the no3 reduction process excellent no3 reduction efficiency 90 was achieved at ph 3 in the presence of 1 mm fe iii and 10 mm oxalate under uv irradiation for 120 min high fe iii and oxalate concentrations promote no3 removal in addition there was an increase in the no3 removal amount with a greater initial no3 concentration about 60 of no3 can be selectively reduced to n2 with low selectivity to no2 3 4 of total n and nh4 15 7 of total n in general the uv fe iii oxalate system provided an alternative way to improve no3 removal performance and selectivity to form n2 in water and wastewater remediation processes keywords carbon dioxide radical nitrate reduction uv fe iii oxalate system selectivity nitrogen gas 1 introduction in recent years no3 pollution has become a serious environmental problem due to agricultural fertilizer use waste disposal industrial wastewater discharge and other activities pollution of no3 threatens people s health and economic development 1 2 high concentrations of no3 in water may cause eutrophication of the water body due to blooming of algae and other aquatic organisms bringing a serious problem of low dissolved oxygen concentration and large scale fish kills moreover it has adverse effects on the human body such as methemoglobinemia diabetes and even the prevalence of infectious diseases 3 5 therefore it is essential to intensify no3 removal currently some sophisticated technologies for no3 removal from wastewater have been developed involving physical methods biological denitrification methods and chemical reduction methods 1 3 6 however the disadvantages and limitations remain physical processes such as ion exchange and reverse osmosis require regeneration and are susceptible to other contaminants 7 excessive and chemically complicated sludge is produced causing secondary pollution threats to the environment treatment and disposal also become a major issue during the biological denitrification process 8 9 compared with the above conventional technologies chemical reduction provides an attractive alternative method for no3 remediation due to its high reaction rate 10 11 one technique nano zero valent iron nzvi has been studied intensively for application in no3 removal nevertheless nzvi still faces many disadvantages of poor selectivity low removal performance and easy agglomeration 12 besides the reducing species from water gamma irradiation process 13 15 such as hydrated electron eaq hydrogen radical h and superoxide radical o2 which could participate in no3 reduction 16 unfortunately the operational costs and safety issues limit its application a particular chemical reduction method co2 radicals with a low redox potential e co2 co2 1 9 v 17 is attracting increasing attention for pollutant reduction e g substituted benzenes 18 carbon tetrachloride 19 trichloroacetic acid 20 maleate 21 fumarate 21 and heavy metal ions e g cr ⅵ 22 hg ii 23 and no3 24 because of its high reduction efficiency and pollution free reduction product co2 the co2 radical is an excellent reductive species with strong reducibility which could convert no3 into nh4 e no3 nh4 1 203 v e no2 nh4 0 897 v 25 26 and n2 e no2 n2 1 45 v 10 in our previous work we developed a uv h2o2 hcooh system for no3 reduction by generating co2 radicals with high no3 reduction efficiency and selectivity for n2 24 however peroxide storage and transportation limit its scope of application the photo fenton reaction is considered as an effective process of free radical generation rapidly and it has low material costs 27 therefore it is attractive to construct an advanced reductive process of co2 radical generation from photo fenton reaction and broaden its application in environmental pollution removal oxalate is abundant in the natural water environment and is usually found in industrial wastewaters it can form strong photoactive fe iii oxalate complexes with dissolved fe iii 28 for instance fe c2o4 2 or fe c2o4 3 3 it is well known that oh radical could be generated by the photolysis of ferrioxalate complexes in the effect of ligand to metal charge transfer lmct and promote fe ⅱ fe ш cycle 28 there are many reports about of oh radical participate in environmental or anthropogenic pollutants removal and transformation i e sb ш 29 phosphite 30 glyphosate 31 azo dye reactive black 5 32 and etc but only relatively few studies focus on photoreduction the co2 radical reductive species could be generated in the fe iii oxalate photolysis process eqs 1 and 2 33 34 which provides a mechanism for substance reduction 1 f e c 2 o 4 n 3 2 n h v f e 2 n 1 c 2 o 4 2 c 2 o 4 2 c 2 o 4 c o 2 c o 2 hug and laubscher 35 mentioned the possibility that chromium ⅵ in aqueous solutions was reduced by co2 radicals from the photolysis of ferric oxalate complexes huston and pignatello 36 demonstrated that co2 radicals could participate in the reduction of perchloroalkanes in uv illuminated ferric oxalate solutions ababneh et al 37 found that co2 radicals could be used to reduce mercuric chloride in the presence of fe iii complexes under uv irradiation qi zhou et al 38 illustrated that the reaction mechanism of cr vi removal in photo fe ш oxalate reduction system to date uv fe iii oxalate has not been applied in the no3 reduction process additionally the no3 reduction efficiency byproducts selectivity and possible mechanism remain unclear therefore this study was mainly concerned with 1 reducing no3 effectively in the uv fe iii oxalate system in the absence of dissolved oxygen 2 adjusting and controlling no3 reduction efficiency and selectivity to n2 for various controlling factors and 3 proposing a possible no3 reduction mechanism based on co2 radical generation 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals potassium nitrate kno3 iron chloride hexahydrate fecl3 6h2o sodium oxalate na2c2o4 ammonium sulfamate nh4so3nh2 hydrazine dihydrochloride n2h4 2hcl p dimethylaminobenzaldehyde c9h11no hydrochloric acid hcl and sodium hydroxide naoh were acquired from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd shanghai china 1 10 phenanthroline c12h8n2 hcl h2o and 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo c6h11no were supplied by aladdin chemistry co ltd shanghai china all the chemicals in the experiments were used without any purification 2 2 catalytic removal of no3 via uv irradiation a batch of the photochemical experiment was performed in a 0 1 l cylindrical glass reactor with quartz tubes under 500 w uv ggz500 from osram irradiation with a dominant wavelength of 365 nm the detection of uv light intensity 25 3 mw cm2 was determined by a cel np 2000 light metre from ceaulioht the corresponding calculated incident uv photon flux was 772 6 μmol m2 s 1 39 the appropriate concentrations of fe iii and oxalate were dissolved in a 100 ml beaker to form fe iii oxalate complexes afterward the ph of the solutions was adjusted using 1 m hcl or naoh at the desired level then a specific concentration of no3 was added to the fe iii oxalate complex subsequently the reaction solution containing no3 was transferred into quartz tubes and the experiment was carried out the presence of dissolved oxygen decreases the amount of co2 radicals and further affects no3 removal therefore dissolved oxygen in solutions was removed by bubbling n2 gas during the ultraviolet light irradiation the samples were filtered through a 0 22 μm membrane and analyzed immediately after a 120 min reaction all experiments were performed in triplicate and the mean values and standard deviations are shown 2 3 analysis no3 no2 nh4 nh3 and residual oxalate concentrations were detected by using ion chromatography mic switzerland dissolved fe ii was quantified by the 1 10 phenanthroline method at the maximum wavelength of 510 nm using a spectrophotometric method uv 2600 shimadzu 40 41 the n2h4 concentration was determined according to the p dimethylaminobenzaldehyde spectrophotometric method at 458 nm 42 the no3 reduction products include no2 nh4 n2h4 and gaseous n species mainly n2 and contain other small amounts of gaseous n i e n2o3 and n2o4 43 44 can be defined as follows 3 and 4 3 s a q u e o u s n a q u e o u s n t n o 3 100 4 s g a s e o u s n s n 2 100 s a q u e o u s n where aqueous n t and no3 are the concentrations of no2 nh4 n2h4 and reduced no3 concentration in the test solution at reaction time t it is difficult to detect the amount of n2 production because our test system is open however total nitrogen dissolved in solution loss is ascribed to n2 formation directly in most published studies 3 therefore the loss of gaseous n species could be considered as mainly n2 formation which can be calculated by the difference of reduced no3 concentration and aqueous n species based on mass balance in our system in addition a low n2h4 concentration of 0 01 mg n l i e 0 07 of total n was observed at 120 min in the presence of 1 mm fe iii 10 mm oxalate and 14 mg n l no3 at ph 3 n2h4 as one of the intermediate byproducts in the no3 reduction process is an unstable compound in thermodynamics 45 thus it is acceptable that no2 nh4 and n2 were regarded as the main reductive byproducts the radical measurement was performed by the epr experiment elexsys e580 bruker germany under the conditions of 9 64 ghz microwave frequency 0 94 mw microwave power 100 khz modulation frequency and 2 0 g modulation amplitude the dimethyl pyridine n oxide dmpo was selected as radical scavenger in detail the appropriate concentration dmpo was added in the mixture contain 1 mm fe ш and 10 mm oxalate at ph 2 the n2 was bubbled in the mixture for 15 min and then exposed in uv irradiation a certain amount of mixture solution was sampled quickly and transferred to the epr for testing 3 results and discussion 3 1 the performance of no3 removal in the comparative system fig 1 shows the no3 reduction efficiency in various comparative processes containing no3 solution alone and with the presence of fe iii oxalate and fe iii oxalate complexes the results indicate that only 1 6 0 5 and 0 7 0 8 no3 was removed in the photolysis of no3 and fe iii alone respectively oxalate photolysis mainly hc2o4 and c2o4 2 was not important because the wavelength of the peak absorbance was 194 nm fig s1 while the dominant wavelength in the uv system was 365 nm the addition of oxalate increased the no3 reduction efficiency to 50 7 1 1 approximately 31 times higher than no3 photolysis which may be related to the co2 effect this may be explained by oh production from no3 and no2 photolysis 3 46 followed by the reaction of oh with oxalate to generate co2 radicals eqs 12 and 13 29 the corresponding no3 and no2 photolysis processes are shown in eqs 5 11 39 5 n o 3 h v n o 3 6 n o 3 n o 2 o 7 o h 2 o o h o h 8 2 n o 2 h 2 o n o 2 n o 3 2 h 9 n o 2 h v n o 2 10 n o 2 n o o 11 n o o h h n o 2 12 o h h c 2 o 4 c o 2 c o 2 h 2 o 13 o h c 2 o 4 c o 2 c o 2 o h that is the presence of oxalate could enhance no3 reduction efficiency under uv irradiation to our surprise 89 4 0 8 no3 removal was achieved in the presence of fe iii oxalate complexes in 120 min due to a large amount of co2 radical generation meanwhile the no3 reduction efficiency of the uv fe iii oxalate system is 1 76 times that of the uv oxalate system the results indicate that more co2 radicals result in a higher no3 reduction efficiency therefore the uv fe iii oxalate system could be considered an effective way to enhance no3 reduction efficiency to identify the main reactive species an epr experiment was carried out in the presence of 1 mm fe iii and 10 mm oxalate by uv irradiation without dissolved oxygen as shown in fig 2 the characteristic spectra of the dmpo co2 adduct αh 21 90 g αh β 15 21 g 20 22 was observed which provided direct evidence of the existence of co2 besides there were no free radicals were generated in the photolysis of fe iii and oxalate alone 38 for the above discussion the result supports the reductive co2 radical generation mechanism of the uv fe iii oxalate system eqs 1 and 2 3 2 effects of experimental parameters on no3 removal and selectivity to n2 3 2 1 fe iii concentration fig 3 displays the effect of fe iii concentration levels fe iii 0 5 1 2 and 3 mm on no3 reduction efficiency and the product selectivity of the n species the results showed that the no3 ultimate reduction efficiency was basically about 80 after 120 min reaction and it seemed to be irrelevant to initial fe iii concentration in fact a higher fe iii concentration could enhance the no3 reduction rate and it reflected in the selectivity of byproducts when the fe iii concentration increased from 0 5 mm to 3 mm the selectivity to no2 increased to 9 1 0 4 from 2 3 0 8 and the selectivity to nh4 increased from 51 6 4 1 83 7 6 4 in contrast the n species main n2 selectivity presented a descending trend also a high fe iii concentration could produce more fe iii oxalate complexes 47 that promote the reaction towards products with more co2 radicals being generated eqs 1 and 2 additionally the increase in fe iii concentration could increase light absorption from 290 nm to 450 nm 30 that is ferrioxalate complexes could capture more photons and generate more co2 radicals these co2 radicals enhanced the no3 reduction rate and led to rapid accumulation of nh4 the oxalate residue concentration presented a slight decline from 5 9 0 2 to 5 1 0 3 mm fig s2 as a result the presence of a lower fe iii concentration is beneficial for n2 selectivity and it is unnecessary to use a high fe iii concentration for no3 reduction 3 2 2 initial no3 concentration the effects of initial no3 concentrations no3 14 21 and 42 mg l on no3 reduction efficiency and byproducts selectivity are presented in fig 4 a with initial no3 concentrations increasing from 14 mg n l to 42 mg n l the no3 reduction efficiency decreased from 89 4 0 8 to 61 5 3 5 when the concentrations of fe ш and oxalate and initial ph keep a constant the amount of co2 radical generation is also certain a high level of no3 concentrations decreased no3 removal rate in per unit time and caused low reduction efficiency the no3 removal amount increased from 12 5 to 25 8 mg n l fig 4b as the no3 concentration increased more no3 is captured by co2 radicals thus more no3 removal was obtained besides high levels of no3 also lead to an increase in oxalate utilization efficiency in the system fig s3 the selectivity to no2 and gaseous n species mainly n2 present rising trends from 2 8 0 9 to 19 8 3 1 and from 42 4 4 to 51 9 4 9 respectively meanwhile the nh4 selectivity decreased from 54 4 5 4 to 28 3 1 9 on the one hand the reduction of high no3 concentration results in the accumulation of no2 concentration on the other hand as the no3 concentration increased more oh radicals were generated due to no3 photolysis 48 the higher amount of oh radicals transform a partly reductive environment into an oxidative environment which prevents no3 from being over reduced to nh4 thus a higher no3 level is conducive to enhancing the no3 removal amount and improving byproducts selectivity to gaseous n species mainly n2 3 2 3 oxalate concentration the no3 reduction efficiency and selectivity were explored at various oxalate concentrations oxalate 3 7 and 10 mm as presented in fig 5 the no3 reduction efficiency reached 89 4 0 8 as the oxalate concentration increased from 3 to 10 mm the more photochemically active fe iii oxalate complexes mainly fe c2o4 3 3 were produced with increasing oxalate concentration fig s5 this is in accordance with previous reports 30 47 49 thus more co2 radicals were yielded by photolysis of fe c2o4 3 3 which caused an increase in no3 reduction efficiency the selectivity to nh4 increased from 26 9 2 4 to 54 4 5 5 and the selectivity to n2 decreased from 58 3 1 7 to 42 8 4 due to no3 overreduction at the high co2 radical level the oxalate residue ranged from 0 7 0 1 to 5 3 0 2 mm as the oxalate concentration increased from 3 to 10 mm fig s4 thus a higher oxalate concentration could enhance the no3 removal efficiency while causing the accumulation of nh4 3 2 4 initial ph the influence of ph ph 2 3 4 5 and 6 on no3 reduction efficiency and selectivity is displayed in fig 6 a ph plays an important role in ferric complex distribution 30 47 49 the results show that the no3 reduction efficiency is increased from 56 7 1 to 89 4 0 8 at ph 2 3 with increasing ph the amount of fe c2o4 3 3 increases gradually and becomes the main ferric complex fig s7 more co2 radicals were generated in the presence of a high percentage of fe c2o4 3 3 which enhances no3 removal to a certain extent then the no3 reduction efficiency decreased to 75 2 3 2 as the ph increased to 6 it is clear that hydrogen ions h could participate in the no3 reduction process eqs 14 17 however as ph increases the amount of h decreased leading to low no3 reduction efficiency the fe c2o4 3 3 complexes were destroyed and then fe2o3 appeared at ph 6 in addition the oxalate residue concentration increased from 2 8 0 1 to 6 8 0 02 mm at ph 2 6 fig s6 which indicates that low ph is more beneficial to the utilization of oxalate 14 n o 3 2 h 2 c o 2 n o 2 h 2 o 2 c o

ph of 2 however as the initial ph increased further the final ph of the solution presented a rising trend it is clear that the consumption of h resulted from the no3 reduction reaction process mainly no3 was converted to no2 nh4 and n2 eqs 14 17 by co2 radical there is a possibility that the co2 radical was consumed by h because it has a lower potential of 1 9 v eq 18 leading to low no3 removal 60 at ph 2 18 h c o 2 1 2 h 2 c o 2 the product selectivity in the no3 reduction process is shown in fig 6a when the ph increases from 2 to 6 there is a gradual decline in selectivity to gaseous n species mainly n2 and then fluctuation within a certain range the selectivity to no2 presents an increasing trend while nh4 selectivity first decreased a higher selectivity of approximately 66 for gaseous n species mainly n2 and relatively low byproducts 6 0 1 no2 and 28 0 6 nh4 were achieved at ph 2 low amounts of fe c2o4 3 3 and high fe c2o4 2 complexes were observed fig s7 under uv irradiation these ferricoxalate complexes could generate low levels of co2 radicals which improve no3 reduction byproducts to n2 when the ph was 3 more ferric complexes mainly fe c2o4 3 3 were obtained and generated more co2 radicals this led to a relatively reductive environment that is no3 was over reduced to nh4 instead of n2 because solution ph was adjusted using hcl chloride ions cl could scavenge oh radicals in the uv fe iii oxalate system eq 19 rate constant k 4 3 0 4 109 m 1 s 1 and eq 20 k 2 6 0 6 1010 m 1 s 1 50 51 in detail oh radicals could react with cl and form clho in addition clho is also converted to chlorine atoms cl through protonation reactions the second order reaction rate constant of oh with cl is approximately 10 times that with fe2 eq 21 k 4 3 108 m 1 s 1 29 obviously the presence of cl had a negative effect on co2 generation this is in accordance with the results of low no3 removal and high n2 selectivity at ph 2 the presence of cl results in low no3

equilibrium acidity pka1 pka1 6 35 pka2 10 33 for h2co3 52 because the final ph value was below 10 33 hco3 became a dominant species in the uv fe iii oxalate system the second order reaction rate

evolution in the no3 reduction process fig 7 a illustrates the no3 reduction evolution under uv irradiation for 120 min at an initial ph of 2 the average ph value was 2 0 and remained basically constant throughout the no3 reduction process fig s8 the results showed that no3 60 was reduced gradually to gaseous n species main n2 66 the nh4 concentration had an accumulation trend and the maximum value was 2 2 0 6 mg n l 15 7 of total n however a low no2 concentration 0 47 mg n l or 3 4 of total n was observed no2 as an unstable intermediate is easily reduced to nh4 and n2 53 54 by co2 radicals nh4 is likely to be oxidized to n2h4 and n2 45 low no2 and nh4 accumulation indicated that the uv fe iii oxalate system had a great advantage in no3 removal furthermore the insert of fig 7a shows the kinetic model of no3 removal which follows pseudo first order kinetics of ln c c0 kt r2 0 98 min 1 in 120 min the calculated pseudo first order constant was 0 0072 min 1 fe ii fe iii and oxalate concentrations at various uv doses are presented in fig 7b the results showed that the oxalate concentration decreased from 10 to 2 8 0 1 mm while the fe ii concentration was almost unchanged with an average value of 1 mm it is noted that the rapid decline of oxalate concentration occurred when the uv dose increased to 30 36 j cm2 oxalate consumption involves two parts 1 the formation of fe iii oxalate complexes with fe iii and 2 the reaction of oh from photolysis of the fe iii hydroxy complex eqs 24 and 25 29 55 with oxalate to produce the co2 radical eqs 12 and 13 24 f e 3 h 2 o f e o h 2 h 25 f e o h 2 h v f e 2 o h the presence of fe iii and oxalate in the solution forms stable and photoactive fe iii oxalate complexes a series of reductive species mainly fe ii and co2 radicals are then generated by photolysis of fe iii oxalate complexes the co2 radical with a low potential of 1 9 v had the ability to reduce no3 fe ii was oxidized to fe iii by oh radicals from no3 and no2 photolysis 46 and maintained a concentration balance in the whole fe iii oxalate circulation system subsequently the combination of fe iii and residual oxalate forms fe iii oxalate complexes again and then achieves an fe ii fe iii species cycle in addition oh radicals also react with oxalate to generate co2 radicals the second order reaction rate constant of oh radicals with fe ii eq 21 k 4 3 108 m 1 s 1 29 is faster than oxalate eq 12 k 4 7 107 m 1 s 1 eq 13 k 7 7 106 m 1 s 1 29 thus oh radicals are preferentially used in the fe ii fe iii cycle based on the above discussion the possible no3 reduction mechanism fig 8 in the uv fe iii oxalate system is as follows 1 first reductive co2 radicals were yielded by photolysis of fe iii oxalate complexes 2 then no3 was reduced to no2 by the effect of co2 radicals and 3 finally no2 was further reduced to n species including n2h4 nh4 and n2 the corresponding reaction equations are presented in eqs 1 and 2 and 14 17 4 conclusions an advanced fe iii oxalate reduction process was explored to generate co2 radicals under uv radiation for no3 removal the main reductive co2 radical was identified by the epr experiment the ph is a critical control on the amount of co2 production excellent no3 reduction efficiency 90 of total n could be obtained at ph 3 approximately 66 selectivity to gaseous n mainly n2 was observed at ph 2 and 60 no3 was reduced effectively in addition high concentrations of fe iii and oxalate are conducive to no3 removal while causing low selectivity of n2 based on these results we can suggest that great selectivity to n2 was achieved in low levels of co2 radicals while avoiding excessive nh4 formation conversely high co2 radical levels could enhance the no3 reduction efficiency and removal amount of

13633,the generation process for the highly reductive carbon dioxide radical co2 in the fe iii oxalate system is enhanced under uv irradiation and used in nitrate no3 reduction with improved product selectivity to nitrogen n2 the combination of fe iii and residual oxalate forms fe iii oxalate complexes again for an fe ii fe iii species cycle and achieves generation of co2 radical continually the electron paramagnetic resonance epr spectrum demonstrates the existence of co2 radicals in this process some of the important control factors such as initial concentrations of ferric ions fe iii 0 5 1

mentioned ph is a key parameter with an important role in the no3 reduction process excellent no3 reduction efficiency 90 was achieved at ph 3 in the presence of 1 mm fe iii and 10 mm oxalate under uv irradiation for 120 min high fe iii and oxalate concentrations promote no3 removal in addition there was an increase in the no3 removal amount with a greater initial no3 concentration about 60 of no3 can be selectively reduced to n2 with low selectivity to no2 3 4 of total n and nh4 15 7 of total n in general the uv fe iii oxalate system provided an alternative way to improve no3 removal performance and selectivity to form n2 in water and wastewater remediation processes keywords carbon dioxide radical nitrate reduction uv fe iii oxalate system selectivity nitrogen gas 1 introduction in recent years no3 pollution has become a serious environmental problem due to agricultural fertilizer use waste disposal industrial wastewater discharge and other activities pollution of no3 threatens people s health and economic development 1 2 high concentrations of no3 in water may cause eutrophication of the water body due to blooming of algae and other aquatic organisms bringing a serious problem of low dissolved oxygen concentration and large scale fish kills moreover it has adverse effects on the human body such as methemoglobinemia diabetes and even the prevalence of infectious diseases 3 5 therefore it is essential to intensify no3 removal currently some sophisticated technologies for no3 removal from wastewater have been developed involving physical methods biological denitrification methods and chemical reduction methods 1 3 6 however the disadvantages and limitations remain physical processes such as ion exchange and reverse osmosis require regeneration and are susceptible to other contaminants 7 excessive and chemically complicated sludge is produced causing secondary pollution threats to the environment treatment and disposal also become a major issue during the biological denitrification process 8 9 compared with the above conventional technologies chemical reduction provides an attractive alternative method for no3 remediation due to its high reaction rate 10 11 one technique nano zero valent iron nzvi has been studied intensively for application in no3 removal nevertheless nzvi still faces many disadvantages of poor selectivity low removal performance and easy agglomeration 12 besides the reducing species from water gamma irradiation process 13 15 such as hydrated electron eaq hydrogen radical h and superoxide radical o2 which could participate in no3 reduction 16 unfortunately the operational costs and safety issues limit its application a particular chemical reduction method co2 radicals with a low redox potential e co2 co2 1 9 v 17 is attracting increasing attention for pollutant reduction e g substituted benzenes 18 carbon tetrachloride 19 trichloroacetic acid 20 maleate 21 fumarate 21 and heavy metal ions e g cr ⅵ 22 hg ii 23 and no3 24 because of its high reduction efficiency and pollution free reduction product co2 the co2 radical is an excellent reductive species with strong

generating co2 radicals with high no3 reduction efficiency and selectivity for n2 24 however peroxide storage and transportation limit its scope of application the photo fenton reaction is considered as an effective process of free radical generation rapidly and it has low material costs 27 therefore it is attractive to construct an advanced reductive process of co2 radical generation from photo fenton reaction and broaden its application in environmental pollution removal oxalate is abundant in the natural water environment and is usually found in industrial wastewaters it can form strong photoactive fe iii oxalate complexes with dissolved fe iii 28 for instance fe c2o4 2 or fe c2o4 3 3 it is well known that oh radical could be generated by the photolysis of ferrioxalate complexes in the effect of ligand to metal charge transfer lmct and promote fe ⅱ fe ш cycle 28 there are many reports about of oh radical participate in environmental or anthropogenic pollutants removal and transformation i e sb ш 29 phosphite 30 glyphosate 31 azo dye reactive black 5 32 and etc but only relatively few studies focus on photoreduction the co2 radical reductive species could be generated in the fe iii oxalate photolysis process eqs 1 and 2 33 34 which provides a mechanism for substance reduction 1 f e c 2 o 4 n 3 2 n h v f e 2 n 1 c 2 o 4 2 c 2 o 4 2 c 2 o 4 c o 2 c o 2 hug and laubscher 35 mentioned the possibility that chromium ⅵ in aqueous solutions was reduced by co2 radicals from the photolysis of ferric oxalate complexes huston and pignatello 36 demonstrated that co2 radicals could participate in the reduction of perchloroalkanes in uv illuminated ferric oxalate solutions ababneh et al 37 found that co2 radicals could be used to reduce mercuric chloride in the presence of fe iii complexes under uv irradiation qi zhou et al 38 illustrated that the reaction mechanism of cr vi removal in photo fe ш oxalate reduction system to date uv fe iii oxalate has not been applied in the no3 reduction process additionally the no3 reduction efficiency byproducts selectivity and possible mechanism remain unclear therefore this study was mainly concerned with 1 reducing no3 effectively in the uv fe iii oxalate system in the absence of dissolved oxygen 2 adjusting and controlling no3 reduction efficiency and selectivity to n2 for various controlling factors and 3 proposing a possible no3 reduction mechanism based on co2 radical generation 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals potassium nitrate kno3 iron chloride hexahydrate fecl3 6h2o sodium oxalate na2c2o4 ammonium sulfamate nh4so3nh2 hydrazine dihydrochloride n2h4 2hcl p dimethylaminobenzaldehyde c9h11no hydrochloric acid hcl and sodium hydroxide naoh were acquired from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd shanghai china 1 10 phenanthroline c12h8n2 hcl h2o and 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo c6h11no were supplied by aladdin chemistry co ltd shanghai china all the chemicals in the experiments were used without any purification 2 2 catalytic removal of no3 via uv irradiation a batch of the photochemical experiment was performed in a 0 1 l cylindrical glass reactor with quartz tubes under 500 w uv ggz500 from osram irradiation with a dominant wavelength of 365 nm the detection of uv light intensity 25 3 mw cm2 was determined by a cel np 2000 light metre from ceaulioht the corresponding calculated incident uv photon flux was 772 6 μmol m2 s 1 39 the appropriate concentrations of fe iii and oxalate were dissolved in a 100 ml beaker to form fe iii oxalate complexes afterward the ph of the solutions was adjusted using 1 m hcl or naoh at the desired level then a specific concentration of no3 was added to the fe iii oxalate complex subsequently the reaction solution containing no3 was transferred into quartz tubes and the experiment was carried out the presence of dissolved oxygen decreases the amount of co2 radicals and further affects no3 removal therefore dissolved oxygen in solutions was removed by bubbling n2 gas during the ultraviolet light irradiation the samples were filtered through a 0 22 μm membrane and analyzed immediately after a 120 min reaction all experiments were performed in triplicate and the mean values and standard deviations are shown 2 3 analysis no3 no2 nh4 nh3 and residual oxalate concentrations were detected by using ion chromatography mic switzerland dissolved fe ii was quantified by the 1 10 phenanthroline method at the maximum wavelength of 510 nm using a spectrophotometric method uv 2600 shimadzu 40 41 the n2h4 concentration was determined according to the p dimethylaminobenzaldehyde spectrophotometric method at 458 nm 42 the no3 reduction products include no2 nh4 n2h4 and gaseous n species mainly n2 and contain other small amounts of gaseous n i e n2o3 and n2o4 43 44 can be defined as follows 3 and 4 3 s a q u e o u s n a q u e o u s n t n o 3 100 4 s g a s e o u s n s n 2 100 s a q u e o u s n where aqueous n t and no3 are the concentrations of no2 nh4 n2h4 and reduced no3 concentration in the test solution at reaction time t it is difficult to detect the amount of n2 production because our test system is open however total nitrogen dissolved in solution loss is ascribed to n2 formation directly in most published studies 3 therefore the loss of gaseous n species could be considered as mainly n2 formation which can be calculated by the difference of reduced no3 concentration and aqueous n species based on mass balance in our system in addition a low n2h4 concentration of 0 01 mg n l i e 0 07 of total n was observed at 120 min in the presence of 1 mm fe iii 10 mm oxalate and 14 mg n l no3 at ph 3 n2h4 as one of the intermediate byproducts in the no3 reduction process is an unstable compound in thermodynamics 45 thus it is acceptable that no2 nh4 and n2 were regarded as the main reductive byproducts the radical measurement was performed by the epr experiment elexsys e580 bruker germany under the conditions of 9 64 ghz microwave frequency 0 94 mw microwave power 100 khz modulation frequency and 2 0 g modulation amplitude the dimethyl pyridine n oxide dmpo was selected as radical scavenger in detail the appropriate concentration dmpo was added in the mixture contain 1 mm fe ш and 10 mm oxalate at ph 2 the n2 was bubbled in the mixture for 15 min and then exposed in uv irradiation a certain amount of mixture solution was sampled quickly and transferred to the epr for testing 3 results and discussion 3 1 the performance of no3 removal in the comparative system fig 1 shows the no3 reduction efficiency in various comparative processes containing no3 solution alone and with the presence of fe iii oxalate and fe iii oxalate complexes the results indicate that only 1 6 0 5 and 0 7 0 8 no3 was removed in the photolysis of no3 and fe iii alone respectively oxalate photolysis mainly hc2o4 and c2o4 2 was not important because the wavelength of the peak absorbance was 194 nm fig s1 while the dominant wavelength in the uv system was 365 nm the addition of oxalate increased the no3 reduction efficiency to 50 7 1 1 approximately 31 times higher than no3 photolysis which may be related to the co2 effect this may be explained by oh production from no3 and no2 photolysis 3 46 followed by the reaction of oh with oxalate to generate co2 radicals eqs 12 and 13 29 the corresponding no3 and no2 photolysis processes are shown in eqs 5 11 39 5 n o 3 h v n o 3 6 n o 3 n o 2 o 7 o h 2 o o h o h 8 2 n o 2 h 2 o n o 2 n o 3 2 h 9 n o 2 h v n o 2 10 n o 2 n o o 11 n o o h h n o 2 12 o h h c 2 o 4 c o 2 c o 2 h 2 o 13 o h c 2 o 4 c o 2 c o 2 o h that is the presence of oxalate could enhance no3 reduction efficiency under uv irradiation to our surprise 89 4 0 8 no3 removal was achieved in the presence of fe iii oxalate complexes in 120 min due to a large amount of co2 radical generation meanwhile the no3 reduction efficiency of the uv fe iii oxalate system is 1 76 times that of the uv oxalate system the results indicate that more co2 radicals result in a higher no3 reduction efficiency therefore the uv fe iii oxalate system could be considered an effective way to enhance no3 reduction efficiency to identify the main reactive species an epr experiment was carried out in the presence of 1 mm fe iii and 10 mm oxalate by uv irradiation without dissolved oxygen as shown in fig 2 the characteristic spectra of the dmpo co2 adduct αh 21 90 g αh β 15 21 g 20 22 was observed which provided direct evidence of the existence of co2 besides there were no free radicals were generated in the photolysis of fe iii and oxalate alone 38 for the above discussion the result supports the reductive co2 radical generation mechanism of the uv fe iii oxalate system eqs 1 and 2 3 2 effects of experimental parameters on no3 removal and selectivity to n2 3 2 1 fe iii concentration fig 3 displays the effect of fe iii concentration levels fe iii 0 5 1 2 and 3 mm on no3 reduction efficiency and the product selectivity of the n species the results showed that the no3 ultimate reduction efficiency was basically about 80 after 120 min reaction and it seemed to be irrelevant to initial fe iii concentration in fact a higher fe iii concentration could enhance the no3 reduction rate and it reflected in the selectivity of byproducts when the fe iii concentration increased from 0 5 mm to 3 mm the selectivity to no2 increased to 9 1 0 4 from 2 3 0 8 and the selectivity to nh4 increased from 51 6 4 1 83 7 6 4 in contrast the n species main n2 selectivity presented a descending trend also a high fe iii concentration could produce more fe iii oxalate complexes 47 that promote the reaction towards products with more co2 radicals being generated eqs 1 and 2 additionally the increase in fe iii concentration could increase light absorption from 290 nm to 450 nm 30 that is ferrioxalate complexes could capture more photons and generate more co2 radicals these co2 radicals enhanced the no3 reduction rate and led to rapid accumulation of nh4 the oxalate residue concentration presented a slight decline from 5 9 0 2 to 5 1 0 3 mm fig s2 as a result the presence of a lower fe iii concentration is beneficial for n2 selectivity and it is unnecessary to use a high fe iii concentration for no3 reduction 3 2 2 initial no3 concentration the effects of initial no3 concentrations no3 14 21 and 42 mg l on no3 reduction efficiency and byproducts selectivity are presented in fig 4 a with initial no3 concentrations increasing from 14 mg n l to 42 mg n l the no3 reduction efficiency decreased from 89 4 0 8 to 61 5 3 5 when the concentrations of fe ш and oxalate and initial ph keep a constant the amount of co2 radical generation is also certain a high level of no3 concentrations decreased no3 removal rate in per unit time and caused low reduction efficiency the no3 removal amount increased from 12 5 to 25 8 mg n l fig 4b as the no3 concentration increased more no3 is captured by co2 radicals thus more no3 removal was obtained besides high levels of no3 also lead to an increase in oxalate utilization efficiency in the system fig s3 the selectivity to no2 and gaseous n species mainly n2 present rising trends from 2 8 0 9 to 19 8 3 1 and from 42 4 4 to 51 9 4 9 respectively meanwhile the nh4 selectivity decreased from 54 4 5 4 to 28 3 1 9 on the one hand the reduction of high no3 concentration results in the accumulation of no2 concentration on the other hand as the no3 concentration increased more oh radicals were generated due to no3 photolysis 48 the higher amount of oh radicals transform a partly reductive environment into an oxidative environment which prevents no3 from being over reduced to nh4 thus a higher no3 level is conducive to enhancing the no3 removal amount and improving byproducts selectivity to gaseous n species mainly n2 3 2 3 oxalate concentration the no3 reduction efficiency and selectivity were explored at various oxalate concentrations oxalate 3 7 and 10 mm as presented in fig 5 the no3 reduction efficiency reached 89 4 0 8 as the oxalate concentration increased from 3 to 10 mm the more photochemically active fe iii oxalate complexes mainly fe c2o4 3 3 were produced with increasing oxalate concentration fig s5 this is in accordance with previous reports 30 47 49 thus more co2 radicals were yielded by photolysis of fe c2o4 3 3 which caused an increase in no3 reduction efficiency the selectivity to nh4 increased from 26 9 2 4 to 54 4 5 5 and the selectivity to n2 decreased from 58 3 1 7 to 42 8 4 due to no3 overreduction at the high co2 radical level the oxalate residue ranged from 0 7 0 1 to 5 3 0 2 mm as the oxalate concentration increased from 3 to 10 mm fig s4 thus a higher oxalate concentration could enhance the no3 removal efficiency while causing the accumulation of nh4 3 2 4 initial ph the influence of ph ph 2 3 4 5 and 6 on no3 reduction efficiency and selectivity is displayed in fig 6 a ph plays an important role in ferric complex distribution 30 47 49 the results show that the no3 reduction efficiency is increased from 56 7 1 to 89 4 0 8 at ph 2 3 with increasing ph the amount of fe c2o4 3 3 increases gradually and becomes the main ferric complex fig s7 more co2 radicals were generated in the presence of a high percentage of fe c2o4 3 3 which enhances no3 removal to a certain extent then the no3 reduction efficiency decreased to 75 2 3 2 as the ph increased to 6 it is clear that hydrogen ions h could participate in the no3 reduction process eqs 14 17 however as ph increases the amount of h decreased leading to low no3 reduction efficiency the fe c2o4 3 3 complexes were destroyed and then fe2o3 appeared at ph 6 in addition the oxalate residue concentration increased from 2 8 0 1 to 6 8 0 02 mm at ph 2 6 fig s6 which indicates that low ph is more beneficial to the utilization of oxalate 14 n o 3 2 h 2 c o 2 n o 2 h 2 o 2 c o

ph of 2 however as the initial ph increased further the final ph of the solution presented a rising trend it is clear that the consumption of h resulted from the no3 reduction reaction process mainly no3 was converted to no2 nh4 and n2 eqs 14 17 by co2 radical there is a possibility that the co2 radical was consumed by h because it has a lower potential of 1 9 v eq 18 leading to low no3 removal 60 at ph 2 18 h c o 2 1 2 h 2 c o 2 the product selectivity in the no3 reduction process is shown in fig 6a when the ph increases from 2 to 6 there is a gradual decline in selectivity to gaseous n species mainly n2 and then fluctuation within a certain range the selectivity to no2 presents an increasing trend while nh4 selectivity first decreased a higher selectivity of approximately 66 for gaseous n species mainly n2 and relatively low byproducts 6 0 1 no2 and 28 0 6 nh4 were achieved at ph 2 low amounts of fe c2o4 3 3 and high fe c2o4 2 complexes were observed fig s7 under uv irradiation these ferricoxalate complexes could generate low levels of co2 radicals which improve no3 reduction byproducts to n2 when the ph was 3 more ferric complexes mainly fe c2o4 3 3 were obtained and generated more co2 radicals this led to a relatively reductive environment that is no3 was over reduced to nh4 instead of n2 because solution ph was adjusted using hcl chloride ions cl could scavenge oh radicals in the uv fe iii oxalate system eq 19 rate constant k 4 3 0 4 109 m 1 s 1 and eq 20 k 2 6 0 6 1010 m 1 s 1 50 51 in detail oh radicals could react with cl and form clho in addition clho is also converted to chlorine atoms cl through protonation reactions the second order reaction rate constant of oh with cl is approximately 10 times that with fe2 eq 21 k 4 3 108 m 1 s 1 29 obviously the presence of cl had a negative effect on co2 generation this is in accordance with the results of low no3 removal and high n2 selectivity at ph 2 the presence of cl results in low no3 reduction efficiency however it also improves byproducts to n2 selectivity to some extent 19 o h c l clh o 20 c l h o h c l h 2 o 21 f e 2 o h f e 3 bicarbonate hco3 and carbonate co3 2 can be

equilibrium acidity pka1 pka1 6 35 pka2 10 33 for h2co3 52 because the final ph value was below 10 33 hco3 became a dominant species in the uv fe iii oxalate system the second order reaction rate

evolution in the no3 reduction process fig 7 a illustrates the no3 reduction evolution under uv irradiation for 120 min at an initial ph of 2 the average ph value was 2 0 and remained basically constant throughout the no3 reduction process fig s8 the results showed that no3 60 was reduced gradually to gaseous n species main n2 66 the nh4 concentration had an accumulation trend and the maximum value was 2 2 0 6 mg n l 15 7 of total n however a low no2 concentration 0 47 mg n l or 3 4 of total n was observed no2 as an unstable intermediate is easily reduced to nh4 and n2 53 54 by co2 radicals nh4 is likely to be oxidized to n2h4 and n2 45 low no2 and nh4 accumulation indicated that the uv fe iii oxalate system had a great advantage in no3 removal furthermore the insert of fig 7a shows the kinetic model of no3 removal which follows pseudo first order kinetics of ln c c0 kt r2 0 98 min 1 in 120 min the calculated pseudo first order constant was 0 0072 min 1 fe ii fe iii and oxalate concentrations at various uv doses are presented in fig 7b the results showed that the oxalate concentration decreased from 10 to 2 8 0 1 mm while the fe ii concentration was almost unchanged with an average value of 1 mm it is noted that the rapid decline of oxalate concentration occurred when the uv dose increased to 30 36 j cm2 oxalate consumption involves two parts 1 the formation of fe iii oxalate complexes with fe iii and 2 the reaction of oh from photolysis of the fe iii hydroxy complex eqs 24 and 25 29 55 with oxalate to produce the co2 radical eqs 12 and 13 24 f e 3 h 2 o f e o h 2 h 25 f e o h 2 h v f e 2 o h the presence of fe iii and oxalate in the solution forms stable and photoactive fe iii oxalate complexes a series of reductive species mainly fe ii and co2 radicals are then generated by photolysis of fe iii oxalate complexes the co2 radical with a low potential of 1 9 v had the ability to reduce no3 fe ii was oxidized to fe iii by oh radicals from no3 and no2 photolysis 46 and maintained a concentration balance in the whole fe iii oxalate circulation system subsequently the combination of fe iii and residual oxalate forms fe iii oxalate complexes again and then achieves an fe ii fe iii species cycle in addition oh radicals also react with oxalate to generate co2 radicals the second order reaction rate constant of oh radicals with fe ii eq 21 k 4 3 108 m 1 s 1 29 is faster than oxalate eq 12 k 4 7 107 m 1 s 1 eq 13 k 7 7 106 m 1 s 1 29 thus oh radicals are preferentially used in the fe ii fe iii cycle based on the above discussion the possible no3 reduction mechanism fig 8 in the uv fe iii oxalate system is as follows 1 first reductive co2 radicals were yielded by photolysis of fe iii oxalate complexes 2 then no3 was reduced to no2 by the effect of co2 radicals and 3 finally no2 was further reduced to n species including n2h4 nh4 and n2 the corresponding reaction equations are presented in eqs 1 and 2 and 14 17 4 conclusions an advanced fe iii oxalate reduction process was explored to generate co2 radicals under uv radiation for no3 removal the main reductive co2 radical was identified by the epr experiment the ph is a critical control on the amount of co2 production excellent no3 reduction efficiency 90 of total n could be obtained at ph 3 approximately 66 selectivity to gaseous n mainly n2 was observed at ph 2 and 60 no3 was reduced effectively in addition high concentrations of fe iii and oxalate are conducive to no3 removal while causing low selectivity of n2 based on these results we can suggest that great selectivity to n2 was achieved in low levels of co2 radicals while avoiding excessive nh4 formation conversely high co2 radical levels could enhance the no3 reduction efficiency and removal amount of total n therefore this study provides a more effective and eco friendly way to improve selectivity to gaseous n mainly n2 and broad application prospects for underground water environmental

13634,many biological methods are currently used to treat wastewaters such as e g aerobic anaerobic sequencing batch reactors biofilters however these technologies are limited by low nutrient removal efficiency high energy and large area requirements hereby the intermittent cycle extended aeration system iceas or continuous flow sequencing batch reactor sbr can be an alternative solution therefore understanding all aspects of this technology such as reaction mechanisms nitrogen conversion cycle and operation conditions are very necessary this paper reviews the mechanism and key factors affecting the iceas operation conditions to treat many wastewaters an iceas combines many biological processes as aerobic anoxic and anaerobic in one tank iceas has some advantages compared with traditional activated sludge such as less space demand low investment costs low aeration to save operating costs and automatic operation an iceas shows its high efficiencies in removing organic compounds 90 97 of cod removal and nutrients 97 99 of tn removal limiting the accumulation of nitrite and nitrate the continuous inflow feeding into iceas reduces organic loading shock and is beneficial to the growth of microorganisms community hope this paper will help to promote further application of iceas technology for wastewater treatment around the world keywords wastewater biological treatment intermittent cycle extended aeration system iceas tn removal 1 introduction biological methods are traditionally used for many contamination removal processes in wastewater as its environmentally friendliness low investment costs and efficiency in pollutant removal 1 this technology is based on activated sludge including aerobic 2 anaerobic 3 sequencing batch reactor sbr 4 and biofilter 5 the disadvantages of these technologies are sludge s generation and limitation in removal of persistent organic compounds and nutrients 6 the nitrogen removal mechanisms of biological methods are mostly based on conventional nitrification denitrification of an autotrophic and heterotrophic process sharon canon process anammox pn process or combination of these processes for example anammox converts nitrite to nitrogen gas without nitrate accumulation and the nitrite plays a role to accept electrons some anammox bacteria s species include candidatus anammoxoglobus candidatus jettenliuia and candidatus brocade etc optimization of aeration time and stirring time help to accelerate the nitrogen removal by inhibiting nob nitrification oxidation bacteria and favor the development of ammonium oxidation bacteria aob 7 in recent times the intermittent cycle extended aeration system iceas has received considerable attention in treating many wastewaters 8 iceas is a continuous inflow system that offers many advantages compared to complexity activated sludge or sbr methods by combining aeration settling and decanting in a comprehensive process control system without primary or secondary settlement tanks 9 moreover it can reduce energy consumption by 14 5 compared to using a discontinuous inflow system by reducing the aeration time 10 iceas offered tn removal of 58 4 with synthetic wastewater significantly higher than the traditional sequencing batch reactor sbr 8 iceas can significantly reduce the required dissolved oxygen do compared to a traditional sbr tank iceas technology can combine with other technologies to create a comprehensive system an overview of the application of iceas technology is therefore essential to create a principle database for low cost and high efficiency in wastewater treatment understanding all aspects of iceas such as mechanisms of nutrients removal nitrogen and phosphorous organic compounds removal biomass formation and the effects of operation conditions aeration mixing ratio reaction time organic loading on the pollutants removal efficiencies is essential 2 configuration iceas shows an improvement on conventional sbr technology with continuous inflow the iceas tank comprises two reactors pre reactor and main reactor length width ratio usually 3 1 minimum 2 1 as in fig 1 the pre reactor promotes the growth of desirable microorganisms at the main reaction area the pre reactor connects to the main reactor by a space in the bottom of tank there are three phases to iceas operation i the aeration phase including aeration with mixing ii the settling phase and iii the decant phase that produces the clean water as shown in fig 2 the main purpose of the aeration mixing step is to promote the degradation process of organic carbon compounds 11 the mixing process helps to enhance the substrate microorganism contact at the reaction phase alternating aeration and mixing processes generate aerobic anoxic anaerobic conditions that promote the nitrification denitrification process as well as phosphorus release and uptake the nitrogen removal mechanism of an iceas consists of an aob process and nob process the microorganisms in the iceas process are mainly anammox 12 besides aerobic anaerobic integration processes iceas will promote the microorganisms to absorb and endogenously accumulate in cells at anaerobic phase which benefit the microorganisms for endogenous denitrification the aeration phase immediately occurs after the feeding phase to provide carbon for microorganisms the pre reaction zone serves to promote the growth of desirable microorganisms at the main reaction area inhibit filamentous bacteria continuously supply carbon sources and maintain continuous flow for the iceas system the pre reaction zone about 12 15 volume of the iceas tank connects to main area by a bottom space the special zone of the iceas tank contains the main three zones drawdown zone buffer zone sludge biomass zone as displayed in fig 3 the drawdown zone is the sector where the treated water is collected by decanter a buffer zone is an interface between the drawdown zone and sludge biomass zone an iceas combines many biological processes such as aerobic anoxic and anaerobic in one tank to create a flexible wastewater treatment system finally each cycle of iceas during the aeration period results in high phosphorous absorption 13 iceas requires low footprint no need for primary or secondary clarifiers and less required equipment no need for return sludge pump or return sludge piping and is more energy saving than cas the clean water after treatment is removed by a decanter a decanter is controlled by an actuator with a vfc variable frequency control helping to increase water loading up to 6 times compared with the conventional flow the decanter is designed with an anti scum layer to limit the floating sludge decanted so that a secondary clarifier is not need fig 4 shows that iceas comprises two types of operating cycles including nitrification nit and nitrification denitrification ndnp operating cycles the nit cycle for bod tss and ammonium removal occurs in partial denitrification process as in domestic sewage fig 4a the ndnp operating cycle for nitrogen removal and bio p removal is used for stringent effluent standards fig 4b 3 the advantages and disadvantages of iceas technology the conventional nitrification denitrification process consumes organic substances at the aerobic stage and leads to a lacking of carbon in the denitrification period anoxic 14 therefore carbon sources have to be supplied for nitrogen treatment in wastewater that has low c n ratio 4 while an iceas does not iceas decreases the organic carbon demand only 40 and saves 25 cost with activated sludge several studies indicated the aeration saving cost was approximately 63 11 15 tn removal is very high at 98 while total nitrogen removal is only around 8 31 at c n 4 in the traditional sbr system 16 iceas promotes the development of anammox process and decreases the sludge production furthermore iceas decreases 20 carbon oxide emission 17 iceas is more cost effective than conventional sbr and offers a simple fully automatic operation iceas with inflow feeding has high capability for anti shock cod loading and shortage of carbon source with wastewaters with low c n ratio i e swine wastewater leachate tanning etc it increases the diversity of microbial communities with high pollutant removal efficiencies to treat different types of wastewaters more than 900 iceas systems were operated all over the world in october 2003 such as chengyang wastewater treatment plant qingdao china including eight reaction tanks 38 m diameter iceas systems shows many benefits such as greatly reduced pumping requirement cost savings of about 3 million chinese yuan rmb for equipment investment and 1 million rmb in operating cost the improvement in ammonium removal efficiency and investment costs at sterling wastewater treatment works uk by iceas were achieved to fit the european regulation uwwtd for effluent the upgraded iceas wastewater treatment plant at the jefferson city regional water reclamation facility usa helped improve bod tss and nutrient nitrogen and phosphorous removal efficiencies and saved about 30 of investment cost the upgraded iceas at doha wastewater treatment works qatarby was combined with a membrane filtration system for water reuse the manchay panchamac wastewater treatment plant peru applied iceas for water reuse in irrigation and st john s plant in pennsylvania usa also applied iceas for municipal wastewater treatment however iceas has a some disadvantages compared with the conventional activated sludge process as being a complex operation system it requires total automation which requires some expertise by the operator 8 4 nitrogen and other pollutants conversion cycles in iceas generally the nitrifying bacteria in activated sludge are nitrosomonas nitrosococcus nitrobacter and nitrococcus containing two types of ammonium oxidizing bacteria aob negative gram bacteria that includes two subclasses β subclass and γ subclass 18 aob is aerobic bacteria do 0 8 mg l however a few special bacteria are facultative do 0 8 mg l 17 nitrification oxidation bacteria nob grow at optimal do concentration 1 5 mg l the ammonia monooxygenase amo enzyme is the first enzyme that acts as a catalyst for the ammonia oxidizing hydroxylamine nh2oh process shown in eq 1 hydroxylamine oxidoreductase enzyme is a product of nitrosomonas europaea taking the role of a catalyst to convert hydroxyl amine into nitric oxide as shown in eq 2 if this process occurs incompletely it will release an n2o emission 19 after that n2o will be converted to nitrite by the nitrite oxidoreductase nxr enzyme as shown in eq 3 this enzyme consists of 2 3 subunits combined with metals such as iron copper etc in general the nitrogen conversion process is nh4 o2 no2 o2 no3 nh4 plays the role of a nitrogen source for microbial cell growth and the anammox process as shown in eqs 4 and 5 the nitrification process is an unnecessary stage for the nitrogen removal process therefore it is necessary to inhibit the oxidation of nitrite to no3 and to promote the conversion of no2 into n2 gas by heterotrophic denitrification and simultaneous nitrification denitrification process as shown in eq 6 20 aob outperform nob at low do conditions that will promote partial nitrification the mechanism to eliminate

microorganisms use phosphorous for cell formation and energy transfer at the aerobic stage phosphorous is absorbed into microorganisms cell and releases dissolved phosphate salt at the anaerobic stage phosphorous is accumulated and stored in the cell for usage when necessary anaerobic condition induces the hydrolysis of polyphosphates formation atp and enhances inorganic phosphorous concentration into cells this leads to release of large amount of phosphate from the microorganism s cell release phosphorous at the aerobic stage the organic substances are strongly decreased phosphorous

2 5 influential factors on partial nitrogen process in iceas the biotransformation of activated sludge in the iceas system is affected by adverse factors such as wastewater with high cod concentrations for example 22 showed that the partial nitrogen pn processes occur best with a c n ratio 1 an increase in cod concentration will lead to an increase in heterotrophic oxidation and a reduction of the partial nitrogen efficiency while do below 0 5 mg l will promote biomass formation low cod and do do 0 5 mg l at aob phase 24 will promote the development of pathogenic organisms a few previous reports indicated that low do and high temperature will significantly affect the nob process rather than the aob process strous et al 25 showed anammox operates best at temperature 20 30 c and ph 6 7 to 8 5 the research of 26 showed the capability of simultaneous ammonium and cod removal at optimal temperature 25 35 c and ph 7 14 to 7 20 the operation conditions of iceas are displayed in table 1 6 external carbon sources supply iceas is used to treat low soluble carbon sources such as e g landfill leachate sewage wastewater external carbon sources are often required to carry out the conversion cycle and significant removal of the eutrophying substances nitrogen and phosphorus common chemical compounds used as carbon supplements are diluted with tap water or acetic acid 28 some other chemicals were used as supplementary carbon as methanol 29 ethanol sodium acetate na2co3 30 glucose 31 acetate phenol hydroxypropyl starch 32 hydrolyzed peptone 33 7 wastewater treatment technology using iceas technology 7 1 industrial wastewater treatment industrial wastewater has a high concentration of organic and toxic substances that will seriously affect the environment it is therefore necessary to treat industrial wastewater before it is discharged into receiving sources iceas technology is a suitable technology for treating highly concentrated pollutants in industrial wastewater such as organic compounds colors hydrocarbons and other factors 9 the wastewater from certain industries with very high salt concentrations will affect microbiological activities for example showed that salt concentrations above 1 2 in the wastewater of the olive oil processing industry will reduce the activity of microorganisms sedimentation capacity biological reaction ability and biomass ability the wastewater generated from salt fermentation during olive oil processing has high concentration of salt and phenolic with the phenolic concentration about 0 5 1 7 g l high conductivity and cod concentration about 6 20 g l treatment of the salinity wastewater of microorganisms is very difficult 34 ferrer polonio et al 35 used the iceas technology to remove salinity in this wastewater by increasing and decreasing aeration time in two parallel reaction tanks the research investigated the effect of high salinity conductivity is 60 ms cm on the anammox process in the iceas system the result showed that cod removal efficiency was 80 and aeration time was reduced without affecting process efficiency and sludge formation this study indicated that iceas can be applied to treat hypersaline wastewater that contains high total phenol concentrations at long hrt conditions with less energy consumption for aeration the activated sludge was maintained for a long time about 83 days unaeration aeration rate of 8 h 14 h achieved the best cod and total phenol removal efficiencies of 79 5 82 3 and 77 9 78 3 respectively this study still needs to evaluate the adverse impact of high salinity concentration to microbial communities in iceas a combination of iceas with bio carriers may reduce the impact of high salinity concentration on microbial communities and maintain biomass sludge in addition the salt concentration in effluent being discharged into the water environment is also problem li et al 36 studied nutrient removal ability in slaughterhouse wastewater using iceas in a 10 l working volume tank operated at ambient temperature the operating cycle time was 8 h including 7 min of filling time 393 min of reaction time 50 min of aeration time four times 30 min for the sedimentation 50 min of both decanting and idle period for an experiment with organic carbon 1 2 gcod l day the result showed cod tn and tp removals above 90 the research proved that at the first aeration stage 64 tn was eliminated by partial nitrification denitrification process and 34 tn was removed by biomass synthesis process do concentration at the final aeration phase was 3 0 5 5 mg l treatment of slaughterhouse wastewater with iceas technology was studied by pan et al 37 to investigate n2o emissions in iceas when treating the wastewater at low temperature 11 c three aeration ratios 0 4 0 6 0 8 l min were studied with three different experiments when operating at a cycle time of 12 h which consisted of 10 min filling aeration time aeration time 60 min 100 min four replay times 70 min settle and 10 min decant idle at three similar iceas tanks the result showed that aeration increase from 0 4 to 0 8 l min leads to improved n2o gas emission at the anoxic phase compared to the anaerobic phase low do will increase n2o gas emission at the aeration stage do concentration of 0 2 l min did not influence n2o emission at the non aeration phase the aeration 0 6 l min is negatively linear with the n2o gas emission amount evaluated as eq 17 17 g 0 44 a 0 8 r 2 0 90 where a aeration rate l min g n2o emission value mg low oxygen concentration will inhibit the n2o reductase process and promote the n2o gas production process at do 0 56 mg l then2o gas emission will be highest at about 5 1 of saturation air most of the n2o gas generated from the heterotrophic denitrification process and low do concentration do 0 2 mg l had a negligible impact on n2o emission high do concentration will inhibit the heterotrophic denitrification process and high nitrite concentration will inhibit denitrification enzymes a study used intermittent aeration system to treat bio treated coal industry wastewater considering the effect of phenol concentration on ammonia removal ability 20 the study was conducted in a 5 l working volume reactor operated at 28 32 c the cycle time was 6 h with aerobic 4 h and anoxic 2 h treatment the study involved phenol loading of 40 200 mg l day during 100 running days the results showed nh3 n removal performance was strongly affected at high phenol concentration nh3 n phenol ratiowas0 18 similar to a previous study by amor et al 38 the ammonia monooxygenase enzyme is more sensitive with inhibition of phenol than hydroxylamine oxidoreductase enzyme with the inhibiting rates of 32 2 10 5 respectively simultaneous nitrification denitrification snd efficiency achieved the highest removal of 30 5 when the phenol concentration increased then aob activity decreased 30 1 17 5 at the same time denitrification bacteria increased 7 6 18 2 20 several previous studies indicated that phenol and ammonia could be simultaneously removed by using highly effective activated sludge with removal efficiencies of 80 and 25 respectively 5 7 2 municipal wastewater treatment some municipal wastewater contains highly toxic concentrations of cod bod tss ammonium etc released into the environment these would affect the ecological environment and humans thus urban wastewater management is a current issue of concern iceas technology could be a beneficial choice for treating such effluents several previous studies used iceas technology to treat municipal wastewater with low dissolved carbon concentration including 39 this study looked at the role of temperature and biomass on iceas conducted with synthetic and real municipal wastewater the lab scale trials of 4 0 l with hrt 11 h 15 h 25 h and temperatures 10 c 15 c 25 c the cycle time was 6 h with 5 min of filling 290 min of reactor 60 min of settle and 5 min decant the study indicated that low temperatures and low sludge concentration could apply the partial nitrogen process for treating difficult sewage with cod removal performance of 65 2 when reducing temperature and hrt nitrogen emission will decrease and reduce cod removal efficiency it indicated that iceas can be applied to treat sewage at low temperature 10 25 c with cod removal efficiency of 89 2 synthetic wastewater and 33 0 real wastewater cod removal efficiency was different between synthetic wastewater and real wastewater due to the complexity of real wastewater many ingredients compared with synthetic wastewater in the laboratory the impact of real wastewater on microorganisms is more complex than under optimal conditions in the laboratory when reducing temperature and hrt nitrogen emission will decrease al rekabi et al 40 investigated iceas municipal wastewater treatment run at three aeration periods 4 6 and 8 h the tn cod nh4 tp removals of iceas were slightly better 60 91 83 72 than for the common sbr process 56 87 81 69 increasing aeration time will increase cod due to the reduction of organic carbon substance similar to ammonium removal performance iceas improves conventional sbr technology especially as the continuous flow helps to balance the loading and nutrients that leads to anti shock loading and carbon source shortage however aeration time that was too long resulted in nutrient deficiencies for denitrification thus reducing tn removal cod and nitrogen removal efficiencies increased slowly when aeration increased from 6 to 8 h the microbiological community in iceas cannot remove all the complex organic compounds it is important to chose the appropriate cycle time and aeration time depending on the different wastewater types hidaka et al 41 investigated domestic wastewater treatment and used intermittent aeration sequencing batch reactor with continuous flow the pilot scale model consisted of two 64 m3 reaction tanks do was limited to 0 5 2 mg l by the controller total hydraulic retention time was 22 47 h aeration time 20 45 min or 30 45 min the total reaction time was 90 min with stirring time 60 65 min and aeration time 30 min the influent wastewater contained mlss 4000 mg l cod 100 130 mg l ss 200 400 mg l and tn 40 50 mg l temperature 12 24 8 c the study indicated that optimal operating conditions included do of 0 6 1 mg l cycle time 90 min aeration time stirrer time 25 30 60 65 min in tank 1 and 30 45 60 65 min in tank 2 the effluent water contains bod 5 mg l cod 8 mg l tn 3 mg l and ss 5 mg l with solids retention time srt 10 20 days cod and tn are largely removed by the first reaction tank and the remainder is treated by the second tank the concentration of phosphorous dropped sharply from 5 9 to 0 6 mg l the returned sludge s rate was around 100 200 do concentration was significantly affected during the nitrification and denitrification process low do concentration short time aeration will lead to a increase in denitrification in contrast high do concentration long time aeration will lead to an increase of nitrification reduced denitrification nitrate concentration 10 mg l when do 1 mg l determining the optimal aeration time stirrer time ratio is therefore required 7 3 landfill leachate treatment landfill leachate includes many organics heavy metals xenobiotic compounds and ammonium etc its property is based on the landfill s age solid wastes municipal waste industrial waste etc and climate conditions of the area it contains a large amount of poorly biodegradable compounds 42 that affect the environment and humans when discharged directly into the environment treatment of landfill leachate is therefore necessary before discharge into the environment multiple studies have been undertaken in recent years using the partial nitrogen pn anammox process in iceas to treat leachate wastewater for example one study assessed the role of temperature on the development of microorganisms during the nitrification anammox process using an iceas system with a fixed carrier 43 the cycle time operation of 24 h filling time of 10 min aeration time of 4 h settling time 4 h discharging 10 min do was limited at 2 0 2 4 mg l 1 by the controller this research studied nitrogen removal ratio at 30 c 20 c 15 c and 10 c at 15 c nitrogen removal efficiency increased 9 88 by the presence of denitrification bacteria which have advantages compared to nitrite oxidation bacteria nob and anammox bacteria amx 4 56 aob was 6 05 and the refractory bacteria was 24 38 gabarro et al 7 investigated the fluctuation of the microorganism s community in the anammox for leachate treatment the cycle time was 24 h 20 min of settling and 20 min of decant the cycle time was 100 min with four times repetition including 5 min of the pre anoxic 10 min of filling 5 min of anoxic and 89 min of aerobic do was limited to 2 mgl 1 during aeration and ph was kept below 8 0 by hcl 1 m the result of the research showed the suitability and stability of the pn process for leachate treatment the microorganism community fluctuated slightly depending on the different stirring conditions in the reactor betaproteobacteria and bacteroidetes bacteria showed highest concentration qiu et al 44 investigated the treatment efficiency and microbial abundance of the partial nitrification anammox process for simulated leachate removal filling and draining were conducted by two peristaltic pumps operation cycle time was 360 min including 270 min of reaction phase stirrer aeration rate was 15 30 min with the repetition of 6 times 5 min of filling 15 min of decanting and the hrt was 2 9 days the result showed a nitrite accumulation rate about 80 and tn removal performance of 81 5 which was achieved by anammox bacteria candidatus kuenenia decreasing of the aeration rate will increase the abundance of bacteria genus nitrosomonas and candidatusnitrososphaera by 3 44 during the partial nitration process temperature effects the microbial community and several studies have demonstrated this issue for example gabarro et al 7 indentified effect of temperature on aob during the partial nitration process by using the sbr for landfill leachate treatment in that study the sbr tank of 111 l operated at 25 c and 35 c for 100 min including 10 min of filling and 90 min of reaction do was limited to 2 mg l 1 and ph was kept below 8 0 the result showed that the free ammonium fa and nitrous acid fna are sensitive to temperature the main inhibiting factor to microorganisms at 25 c was fna while both fa and fna factors inhibit biological community at 35 c hellinga et al 24 also indicated that a pn anammox process run at a temperature of 30 35 c promotes the aob process and stronger growth than the nob process besides that the chemical balance process of fa and fna was sensitive to temperature both fa and fna factors inhibited the activity of nob and aob at high concentration miao et al 45 reported the ability to remove nitrogen directly via nitrite in landfill leachate by stored polymers mechanism the landfill leachate in this study contained nh4 concentration of 1000 mg n l and cod n 1 4 total cycle time was 24 h with 5 min of filling 1 h of the settling 5 min of decanting and 1370 min of aeration the result indicated that output tn was 10 mg n l 1 when operating at a c n 4 microorganisms can store the carbon source in the aeration stage to supply electronics for the endogenous denitrification process glycogen storage in the microorganism was calculated about 39 8 several other studies have shown similar results for example zhu et al 46 studied nitrogen removal efficiency by an organic denitrification process and intracellular polymers process of microorganisms in landfill leachate using an anaerobic sequencing batch reactor asbr tank connected to a pulsed sequencing batch reactor psbr tank the wastewater of this study had a bod5 cod ratio 0 5 to 0 7 and c n ratio 7 9 the results proved that cod removal efficiency of asbr was about 83 85 when operating with a cod loading from 0 43 to 0 62 gcod gvss day at the psbr tank tn and cod removal efficiencies were 97 03 98 87 and 89 61 9 73 respectively the research by li et al 47 clarified the role of ph on the partial nitrogen process in landfill leachate treatment by an sbr tank the result showed that the partial nitration process was stable after 182 days operated with tn loading about 0 30 0 89 kg n m3 day no2 n nh4 n ratio 1 30 0 22 no3 concentration 16 9 mg l with high fa low do temperature about 28 5 30 c the pilot scale sbr 48 5 52 l had a cycle time of 30 min a settling time of 10 min and 10 min of decanting li et al 48 indicated the partial nitration process affected the intermittent aeration at the sbr with disadvantages in the composition of landfill leachate the result showed that adjusting hrt and flow ratio produces a stable partial nitrogen process increasing the aeration rate improves the ability to remove nitrogen by a partial nitrogen process output tn was 0 71 0 14 kg n m3 day and output cod was 2 21 0 13 kgcod m3 day the nutrient removal efficiency in middle age of landfill leachate was diluted with municipal wastewater about 15 and used an intermittent aeration system 49 conducted a study in a lab scale system of 4 l srt of 12 days and do of 2 mg l the aerobic time anoxic time examined during cycle times of 24 h and 48 h the result proved that experiments without additional external carbon sources resulted in high tn concentrations in contrast by adding crude glycerol during the anoxic phase enhancing cod n ratio to 5 the highest nh4 n tkn no2 n and no3 n removal were 75 7 75 9 99 9 and 99 9 respectively therefore glycerol is an external carbon to enhance denitrification efficiency inhibit the nitrite accumulating concentration and increase phosphorous removal efficiency after 2 3 h of anoxic treatment this research indicated that diluting landfill leachate wastewater with domestic wastewater will decrease the impact of toxic factors such as salinity metals etc in particular recalculation of ingredients was necessary for treating landfill leachate dilution rates of landfill leachate were 10 15 20 25 30 and achieved the optimal ratio of 15 without using supplement carbon the tkn ammonium and cod removal decreased the accumulation of no3 and no2 bod5 cod ratio and biodegradable organic compounds are factors that strongly affect the denitrification process the free ratio of ammonium and nitric acid strongly affect the oxidation of ammonium and nitrite zhang et al 50 used iceas to treat landfill leachate containing compounds such as ammonium nh4 n 1950 250 mg l scod 1900 mg l and tn 2300 mg l the laboratory scale work used a reactor of 10 l at temperature of 28 3 c and maintained airflow at 70 l h during the aeration stage each cycle consisted of five stages filling intermittent aeration anoxic stirrer sedimentation and decant idle the cycle time was 36 h with 5 min of filling 2 h of aeration 3 5 h of anoxic reaction mixing replaying to end cycle 3 min of decanting and idle do was limited at 0 2 mg l the result showed tn removal of 77 1 with partial nitrification process anammox as shown in eq 14 and nitrogen removal performance of 15 6 with common denitrification process as shown in eq 15 the dom increased in anoxic decreased accumulation of no3 by the denitrification path aob and anaob are two primary bacteria types with 12 99 and 8 32 nitrogen and cod were treated simultaneously 7 4 livestock wastewater livestock wastewater contains significant pollutants such as high cod bod residue of antibiotics etc the high ammonium is generated by anaerobic digestion of organic nitrogen the low carbon nitrogen ratio of swine wastewater will decrease the nitrogen removal efficiency in conventional treatment processes there have been many studies using iceas to treat livestock wastewater types in recent years zheng et al 30 treated residual veterinary antibiotics pig wastewater the purpose of the study was to remove 11 residual veterinary antibiotics at different organic loading rates srts solids retention times and cod tn ratio the removal performance was determined by two factors sludge sorption and biodegradation the result showed that 60 of veterinary antibiotics were degraded and 24 absorbed on activated sludge the residual antibiotics removal in swine wastewater was largely affected by high cod loading which does strongly decrease the veterinary antibiotics removal efficiencies the result indicated that residual veterinary antibiotics removal efficiency was 85 1 when operating at cod loading of 0 17 kgcod m3 day and it was decreased with increasing of cod loading tetracycline is the main antibiotic in anaerobically digested swine wastewater 87 9 was removed at the lowest cod loading 57 5 was degraded and 30 4 was absorded in sludge long srt obviously affects the removal ability of antibiotics such as reducing antibiotic accumulation the cod tn ratio has only a slight influence on antibiotic removal deng et al 51 treated swine slurry wastewater using intermittent aeration system with a full scale plant the result indicated that the anaerobic zone could remove 85 of cod and 5 of ammonium nh4 the cod and ammonium removal efficiencies in the aerobic zone achieved 85 and 98 respectively besides that the research also proved that the dilution of raw swine wastewater created more stable operation in the intermittent aeration system than common sbr because swine digested wastewater has low c n ratio leading to insufficient organic carbon to provide for the biological denitrification process as shown in eq 16 the concentration of ammonium in wastewater did not affect its treatment efficiency the aeration process is better than the standard sbr process reducing hrt and the working volume was only about 27 compared to the asbr process song et al 52 compared tn removal efficiency and advantages of iceas with conventional sbr for swine digested wastewater the research was conducted to explore digestion of swine wastewater with high nh4 low c n ratio 1 6 3 4 bod5 cod ratio 0 35 and cod tn ratio 0 95 the total cycle time was 8 h with 10 min of filling 40 min of non aeration 60 min of aeration replay 4 times 60 min of settling in each cycle do was limited at 0 5 1 5 mg l the result demonstrated the ability to remove tn ammonium and toc iceas performed better than the common sbr with 83 1 96 5 and 89 0 removal respectively with iceas the cod used for denitrification was around 48 7 52 2 higher than the conventional sbr 43 1 47 4 at short hrt and high organic carbon loading the mlss and mlvs increased rapidly an increasing cod tn ratio will significantly enhance ammonium removal efficiency the mechanism to remove tn total nitrogen is similar to ammonium removal tn removal efficiency of iceas was lower than ammonium removal by about 10 15 the high tn removal with low organic nitrogen is an advantage of iceas the ammonification and nitrification process are two main processes that directly influence tn removal performance which is more likely to consume organic carbon than sbr normally the fatty acid substrate favored aob but inhibited the growth of nob when fatty acid concentration is too high this also will inhibit the growth of aob zhang et al 53 examined the ability emission of n2o in iceas with swine digested wastewater treatment the wastewater contained cod 11 540 mg l bod5 2900 mg l tn 4041 mg l c n 2 9 and bod5 cod ratio 0 72 the sbr tank 10 l operating in 8 h with filling continuously 30 min of the aeration repeating 6 times 50 min of the non aeration repeating 6 times settling 40 min draw idle 10 min the result indicated that the accumulation of the n2o gas was highest at the non aeration period with an accumulation rate of around 8 3 during the non aeration periods n2o gas emission was low with only 8 3 at the aeration phase however n2o emission was around 91 7 n2o gas emission is from the heterotrophic denitrification and autotrophic denitrification process which is the first product of the process converting nitrate and nitrite to n2 gas no3 no2 no n2o n2 according to henze et al 54 the accumulation of n2o gas increased at the non aeration phase and decreased at the aeration phase low bod5 n ratio may be due to n2o emissions it proved that organic carbon compounds are important factors for the heterotrophic denitrification process the cod n ratio 5 6 promoted denitrification process completely in contrast if organic carbon substance was insufficient the heterotrophic denitrification was not completed increasing n2o emissions the low do concentration promoted the process of generating n2o through the heterotrophic denitrification pathway by nitrosomonas europaea bacteria besides several other factors it also affects the n2o emissions such as free nitric acid fna and ph high no2 concentration will promote both the nf and df processes zhang et al 55 examined the ability of nutrient removal in pig manure anaerobic digestion using iceas at the pilot scale the results indicated that the cod removal was 89 8 when the organic carbon loading was 1 5 kgcod m3 day with swine wastewater and 99 with synthetic wastewater the partial nitrification efficiency reached 71 79 at a stable stage with a tn removal 76 5 this study also agrees with the study of 56 proved that iceas helps to remove high tn in wastewater with c n ratio sheng et al 57 compared the effectiveness between iceas and conventional sbr in treating swine wastewater the experiment was conducted in three identical cylinder tanks 10 lat 21 32 c the duration was 8 h with 10 min of filling 60 min of settling 400 min of the reaction and 10 min of decanting in the iasbr tank 1 the aerobic anoxic ratio was 60 min 40 min switched four times iasbr 2 was 120 min 80 min two switched times and the sbr tank was 240 min 160 min one switched time the swine digested wastewater contained concentrations of cod 2394 mg l ammonium 577 mg l and tn 1194 mg l this study indicated that the ammonium nitrogen total tn removal efficiencies and the ability to resist tn shock loading of iceas were higher than for normal sbr in addition the ammonium and tn removal efficiencies in iasbr tanks 1 switched four times were higher than in the tank iasbr 2 switched two times the abundance degree of species thauera denitrification microbial in tank iasbr 1 was higher than in the sbr tank with 25 63 of iasbr 1 11 575 of sbr and 11 57 of iasbr 2 switched two times this study demonstrated that with more switched times the abundance of denitrification microbial genus will be promoted nob nitrite oxidizing bacteria nitrobacter was only 0 03 and the ammonium oxidizing bacteria aob genus in iasbr tank was nitrosomonas the removal efficiencies of ammonium in the three reaction tanks were significantly different while the tn removal efficiencies were significantly similar the activity of ammonium oxidizing bacteria was impacted by high free ammonium concentration moreover multiple aerobic anoxic conversion led to the increased removal performance of ammonium and tn the iasbr tank promoted the accumulation of no2 n with low c n wastewater promote aob growth and inhibit nob growth in addition high nh4 n will also promote the nitrite s accumulation the high concentration of free ammonium fa is strongly affected by aob and nob 57 claimed that nob will suffer more than aob at fa above 10 mg l and this completely inhibits the nitrification process the effects of aeration time on the nitrification bacteria community abundance and nitrogen removal performance of an intermittent aeration system in swine digested wastewater were investigated by mota et al 27 the research was conducted in five reaction tanks operated at different aeration stirrer ratio conditions including 1 h 1 h 1 h 3 h 0 5 h 1 5 h 0 5 h 2 h and 1 h 4 h with the presence of aob and nob bacteria in a working volume of 6 l anaerobically digested swine wastewater influent contained nh3 n 197 mg l tkn 296 mg l scod 344 mg l and toc 305 mg l with all reactors operating at the ambient temperature of 25 c and the average ph value about 7 6 7 8 the results showed that the reactor was most abundant at an aeration time of 30 min with nitrosospira rrna when the reactor was operated at the anoxic stage about 3 4 h nitrobacter was lowest compared with others bacteria nitrosomonas sp was presented while aob biomass were not significant at all reactors in the long term at the aeration stage nob was more sensitive than aob the accumulation of nitrite was low at 1 h 4 h reactor partial nitrification through nitrite took place entirely in reactors with aeration time of 4 h ammonia removal efficiency does not depend on the abundance of aob species in the results above iceas shows its high pollutant removal efficiency and advantages compared with conventional activated sludge however it is necessary to compare the performances of iceas with other technologies to make a clearer assessment in the selection of suitable technology for each type of wastewater table 2 compares iceas and other biological treatments in various wastewater types the results show that iceas is very effective in wastewater treatment comparable with mbr and better than some traditional methods 8 conclusion iceas was improved from conventional sbr technology with some advantages such as continuous flow allowing for single basin operation during times of maintenance or periods of low flow uniform loading to all basins aeration and clarification in the same basin and automatic operation system leading to cost savings based on the previous studies it can be concluded that iceas is an advanced system to treat many wastewaters such as domestic wastewater industrial wastewater landfill leachate livestock wastewater or low c n ratio s wastewater iceas is applied for removal of nitrogen and phosphorus conversion processes cod bod5 and toc removal efficiencies were mostly higher than 90 while tn was over 80 optimal conditions in iceas could improve the pollutant removal efficiencies decreases organic loading shock increase the abundance of microorganism community and promote the development of the beneficial bacteria community some advantages of iceas compared to conventional sbr were presented such as less volume required 10 30 less equipment fewer tanks no pre treatment and post treatment energy saving about 60 single basin operation more biological nitrogen removal bnr less external carbon required higher nitrification rate higher organic loading shock resistance in future iceas could be combined with other physicochemical and biological treatment methods to increase the quality of effluent reduce space save costs and reduce energy consumption

13634,many biological methods are currently used to treat wastewaters such as e g aerobic anaerobic sequencing batch reactors biofilters however these technologies are limited by low nutrient removal efficiency high energy and large area requirements hereby the intermittent cycle extended aeration system iceas or continuous flow sequencing batch reactor sbr can be an alternative solution therefore understanding all aspects of this technology such as reaction mechanisms nitrogen conversion cycle and operation conditions are very necessary this paper reviews the mechanism and key factors affecting the iceas operation conditions to treat many wastewaters an iceas combines many biological processes as aerobic anoxic and anaerobic in one tank iceas has some advantages compared with traditional activated sludge such as less space demand low investment costs low aeration to save operating costs and automatic operation an iceas shows its high efficiencies in removing organic compounds 90 97 of cod removal and nutrients 97 99 of tn removal limiting the accumulation of nitrite and nitrate the continuous inflow feeding into iceas reduces organic loading shock and is beneficial to the growth of microorganisms community hope this paper will help to promote further application of iceas technology for wastewater treatment around the world keywords wastewater biological treatment intermittent cycle extended aeration system iceas tn removal 1 introduction biological methods are traditionally used for many contamination removal processes in wastewater as its environmentally friendliness low investment costs and efficiency in pollutant removal 1 this technology is based on activated sludge including aerobic 2 anaerobic 3 sequencing batch reactor sbr 4 and biofilter 5 the disadvantages of these technologies are sludge s generation and limitation in removal of persistent organic compounds and nutrients 6 the nitrogen removal mechanisms of biological methods are mostly based on conventional nitrification denitrification of an autotrophic and heterotrophic process sharon canon process anammox pn process or combination of these processes for example anammox converts nitrite to nitrogen gas without nitrate accumulation and the nitrite plays a role to accept electrons some anammox bacteria s species include candidatus anammoxoglobus candidatus jettenliuia and candidatus brocade etc optimization of aeration time and stirring time help to accelerate the nitrogen removal by inhibiting nob nitrification oxidation bacteria and favor the development of ammonium oxidation bacteria aob 7 in recent times the intermittent cycle extended aeration system iceas has received considerable attention in treating many wastewaters 8 iceas is a continuous inflow system that offers many advantages compared to complexity activated sludge or sbr methods by combining aeration settling and decanting in a comprehensive process control system without primary or secondary settlement tanks 9 moreover it can reduce energy consumption by 14 5 compared to using a discontinuous inflow system by reducing the aeration time 10 iceas offered tn removal of 58 4 with synthetic wastewater significantly higher than the traditional sequencing batch reactor sbr 8 iceas can significantly reduce the required dissolved oxygen do compared to a traditional sbr tank iceas technology can combine with other technologies to create a comprehensive system an overview of the application of iceas technology is therefore essential to create a principle database for low cost and high efficiency in wastewater treatment understanding all aspects of iceas such as mechanisms of nutrients removal nitrogen and phosphorous organic compounds removal biomass formation and the effects of operation conditions aeration mixing ratio reaction time organic loading on the pollutants removal efficiencies is essential 2 configuration iceas shows an improvement on conventional sbr technology with continuous inflow the iceas tank comprises two reactors pre reactor and main reactor length width ratio usually 3 1 minimum 2 1 as in fig 1 the pre reactor promotes the growth of desirable microorganisms at the main reaction area the pre reactor connects to the main reactor by a space in the bottom of tank there are three phases to iceas operation i the aeration phase including aeration with mixing ii the settling phase and iii the decant phase that produces the clean water as shown in fig 2 the main purpose of the aeration mixing step is to promote the degradation process of organic carbon compounds 11 the mixing process helps to enhance the substrate microorganism contact at the reaction phase alternating aeration and mixing processes generate aerobic anoxic anaerobic conditions that promote the nitrification denitrification process as well as phosphorus release and uptake the nitrogen removal mechanism of an iceas consists of an aob process and nob process the microorganisms in the iceas process are mainly anammox 12 besides aerobic anaerobic integration processes iceas will promote the microorganisms to absorb and endogenously accumulate in cells at anaerobic phase which benefit the microorganisms for endogenous denitrification the aeration phase immediately occurs after the feeding phase to provide carbon for microorganisms the pre reaction zone serves to promote the growth of desirable microorganisms at the main reaction area inhibit filamentous bacteria continuously supply carbon sources and maintain continuous flow for the iceas system the pre reaction zone about 12 15 volume of the iceas tank connects to main area by a bottom space the special zone of the iceas tank contains the main three zones drawdown zone buffer zone sludge biomass zone as displayed in fig 3 the drawdown zone is the sector where the treated water is collected by decanter a buffer zone is an interface between the drawdown zone and sludge biomass zone an iceas combines many biological processes such as aerobic anoxic and anaerobic in one tank to create a flexible wastewater treatment system finally each cycle of iceas during the aeration period results in high phosphorous absorption 13 iceas requires low footprint no need for primary or secondary clarifiers and less required equipment no need for return sludge pump or return sludge piping and is more energy saving than cas the clean water after treatment is removed by a decanter a decanter is controlled by an actuator with a vfc variable frequency control helping to increase water loading up to 6 times compared with the conventional flow the decanter is designed with an anti scum layer to limit the floating sludge decanted so that a secondary clarifier is not need fig 4 shows that iceas comprises two types of operating cycles including nitrification nit and nitrification denitrification ndnp operating cycles the nit cycle for bod tss and ammonium removal occurs in partial denitrification process as in domestic sewage fig 4a the ndnp operating cycle for nitrogen removal and bio p removal is used for stringent effluent standards fig 4b 3 the advantages and disadvantages of iceas technology the conventional nitrification denitrification process consumes organic substances at the aerobic stage and leads to a lacking of carbon in the denitrification period anoxic 14 therefore carbon sources have to be supplied for nitrogen treatment in wastewater that has low c n ratio 4 while an iceas does not iceas decreases the organic carbon demand only 40 and saves 25 cost with activated sludge several studies indicated the aeration saving cost was approximately 63 11 15 tn removal is very high at 98 while total nitrogen removal is only around 8 31 at c n 4 in the traditional sbr system 16 iceas promotes the development of anammox process and decreases the sludge production furthermore iceas decreases 20 carbon oxide emission 17 iceas is more cost effective than conventional sbr and offers a simple fully automatic operation iceas with inflow feeding has high capability for anti shock cod loading and shortage of carbon source with wastewaters with low c n ratio i e swine wastewater leachate tanning etc it increases the diversity of microbial communities with high pollutant removal efficiencies to treat different types of wastewaters more than 900 iceas systems were operated all over the world in october 2003 such as chengyang wastewater treatment plant qingdao china including eight reaction tanks 38 m diameter iceas systems shows many benefits such as greatly reduced pumping requirement cost savings of about 3 million chinese yuan rmb for equipment investment and 1 million rmb in operating cost the improvement in ammonium removal efficiency and investment costs at sterling wastewater treatment works uk by iceas were achieved to fit the european regulation uwwtd for effluent the upgraded iceas wastewater treatment plant at the jefferson city regional water reclamation facility usa helped improve bod tss and nutrient nitrogen and phosphorous removal efficiencies and saved about 30 of investment cost the upgraded iceas at doha wastewater treatment works qatarby was combined with a membrane filtration system for water reuse the manchay panchamac wastewater treatment plant peru applied iceas for water reuse in irrigation and st john s plant in pennsylvania usa also applied iceas for municipal wastewater treatment however iceas has a some disadvantages compared with the conventional activated sludge process as being a complex operation system it requires total automation which requires some expertise by the operator 8 4 nitrogen and other pollutants conversion cycles in iceas generally the nitrifying bacteria in activated sludge are nitrosomonas nitrosococcus nitrobacter and nitrococcus containing two types of ammonium oxidizing bacteria aob negative gram bacteria that includes two subclasses β subclass and γ subclass 18 aob is aerobic bacteria do 0 8 mg l however a few special bacteria are facultative do 0 8 mg l 17 nitrification oxidation bacteria nob grow at optimal do concentration 1 5 mg l the ammonia monooxygenase amo enzyme is the first enzyme that acts as a catalyst for the ammonia oxidizing hydroxylamine nh2oh process shown in eq 1 hydroxylamine oxidoreductase enzyme is a product of nitrosomonas europaea taking the role of a catalyst to convert hydroxyl amine into nitric oxide as shown in eq 2 if this process occurs incompletely it will release an n2o emission 19 after that n2o will be converted to nitrite by the nitrite oxidoreductase nxr enzyme as shown in eq 3 this enzyme consists of 2 3 subunits combined with metals such as iron copper etc in general the nitrogen conversion process is nh4 o2 no2 o2 no3 nh4 plays the role of a nitrogen source for microbial cell growth and the anammox process as shown in eqs 4 and 5 the nitrification process is an unnecessary stage for the nitrogen removal process therefore it is necessary to inhibit the oxidation of nitrite to no3 and to promote the conversion of no2 into n2 gas by heterotrophic denitrification and simultaneous nitrification denitrification process as shown in eq 6 20 aob outperform nob at low do conditions that will promote partial nitrification the mechanism to eliminate ammonium by genus nitrosomonas bacteria in iceas is shown in eq 7 1 ammonia a h 2 o 2 n h 2 oh a h 2 o 2 0 5 o 2 n h 2 o h 2 2 h hn o 2 2 e n h 2 oh h 2 o hn o 2 4 h 4 e ge at al 2015 3 nitrite

denitrificans this is an autotrophic denitrification process that needs the addition of s2o8 2 or s2 compounds and an alkali agent that plays a role as an electron donor substance reaction of sulfur

microorganisms use phosphorous for cell formation and energy transfer at the aerobic stage phosphorous is absorbed into microorganisms cell and releases dissolved phosphate salt at the anaerobic stage phosphorous is accumulated and stored in the cell for usage when necessary anaerobic condition induces the hydrolysis of polyphosphates formation atp and enhances inorganic phosphorous concentration into cells this leads to release of large amount of phosphate from the microorganism s cell release phosphorous at the aerobic stage the organic substances are strongly decreased phosphorous accumulated in microorganisms contains high phb to create atp energy helping to enhance phosphorous absorption the mechanisms of inorganic phosphorous removal by alcaligenes faecalis and agrobacterium

2 5 influential factors on partial nitrogen process in iceas the biotransformation of activated sludge in the iceas system is affected by adverse factors such as wastewater with high cod concentrations for example 22 showed that the partial nitrogen pn processes occur best with a c n ratio 1 an increase in cod concentration will lead to an increase in heterotrophic oxidation and a reduction of the partial nitrogen efficiency while do below 0 5 mg l will promote biomass formation low cod and do do 0 5 mg l at aob phase 24 will promote the development of pathogenic organisms a few previous reports indicated that low do and high temperature will significantly affect the nob process rather than the aob process strous et al 25 showed anammox operates best at temperature 20 30 c and ph 6 7 to 8 5 the research of 26 showed the capability of simultaneous ammonium and cod removal at optimal temperature 25 35 c and ph 7 14 to 7 20 the operation conditions of iceas are displayed in table 1 6 external carbon sources supply iceas is used to treat low soluble carbon sources such as e g landfill leachate sewage wastewater external carbon sources are often required to carry out the conversion cycle and significant removal of the eutrophying substances nitrogen and phosphorus common chemical compounds used as carbon supplements are diluted with tap water or acetic acid 28 some other chemicals were used as supplementary carbon as methanol 29 ethanol sodium acetate na2co3 30 glucose 31 acetate phenol hydroxypropyl starch 32 hydrolyzed peptone 33 7 wastewater treatment technology using iceas technology 7 1 industrial wastewater treatment industrial wastewater has a high concentration of organic and toxic substances that will seriously affect the environment it is therefore necessary to treat industrial wastewater before it is discharged into receiving sources iceas technology is a suitable technology for treating highly concentrated pollutants in industrial wastewater such as organic compounds colors hydrocarbons and other factors 9 the wastewater from certain industries with very high salt concentrations will affect microbiological activities for example showed that salt concentrations above 1 2 in the wastewater of the olive oil processing industry will reduce the activity of microorganisms sedimentation capacity biological reaction ability and biomass ability the wastewater generated from salt fermentation during olive oil processing has high concentration of salt and phenolic with the phenolic concentration about 0 5 1 7 g l high conductivity and cod concentration about 6 20 g l treatment of the salinity wastewater of microorganisms is very difficult 34 ferrer polonio et al 35 used the iceas technology to remove salinity in this wastewater by increasing and decreasing aeration time in two parallel reaction tanks the research investigated the effect of high salinity conductivity is 60 ms cm on the anammox process in the iceas system the result showed that cod removal efficiency was 80 and aeration time was reduced without affecting process efficiency and sludge formation this study indicated that iceas can be applied to treat hypersaline wastewater that contains high total phenol concentrations at long hrt conditions with less energy consumption for aeration the activated sludge was maintained for a long time about 83 days unaeration aeration rate of 8 h 14 h achieved the best cod and total phenol removal efficiencies of 79 5 82 3 and 77 9 78 3 respectively this study still needs to evaluate the adverse impact of high salinity concentration to microbial communities in iceas a combination of iceas with bio carriers may reduce the impact of high salinity concentration on microbial communities and maintain biomass sludge in addition the salt concentration in effluent being discharged into the water environment is also problem li et al 36 studied nutrient removal ability in slaughterhouse wastewater using iceas in a 10 l working volume tank operated at ambient temperature the operating cycle time was 8 h including 7 min of filling time 393 min of reaction time 50 min of aeration time four times 30 min for the sedimentation 50 min of both decanting and idle period for an experiment with organic carbon 1 2 gcod l day the result showed cod tn and tp removals above 90 the research proved that at the first aeration stage 64 tn was eliminated by partial nitrification denitrification process and 34 tn was removed by biomass synthesis process do concentration at the final aeration phase was 3 0 5 5 mg l treatment of slaughterhouse wastewater with iceas technology was studied by pan et al 37 to investigate n2o emissions in iceas when treating the wastewater at low temperature 11 c three aeration ratios 0 4 0 6 0 8 l min were studied with three different experiments when operating at a cycle time of 12 h which consisted of 10 min filling aeration time aeration time 60 min 100 min four replay times 70 min settle and 10 min decant idle at three similar iceas tanks the result showed that aeration increase from 0 4 to 0 8 l min leads to improved n2o gas emission at the anoxic phase compared to the anaerobic phase low do will increase n2o gas emission at the aeration stage do concentration of 0 2 l min did not influence n2o emission at the non aeration phase the aeration 0 6 l min is negatively linear with the n2o gas emission amount evaluated as eq 17 17 g 0 44 a 0 8 r 2 0 90 where a aeration rate l min g n2o emission value mg low oxygen concentration will inhibit the n2o reductase process and promote the n2o gas production process at do 0 56 mg l then2o gas emission will be highest at about 5 1 of saturation air most of the n2o gas generated from the heterotrophic denitrification process and low do concentration do 0 2 mg l had a negligible impact on n2o emission high do concentration will inhibit the heterotrophic denitrification process and high nitrite concentration will inhibit denitrification enzymes a study used intermittent aeration system to treat bio treated coal industry wastewater considering the effect of phenol concentration on ammonia removal ability 20 the study was conducted in a 5 l working volume reactor operated at 28 32 c the cycle time was 6 h with aerobic 4 h and anoxic 2 h treatment the study involved phenol loading of 40 200 mg l day during 100 running days the results showed nh3 n removal performance was strongly affected at high phenol concentration nh3 n phenol ratiowas0 18 similar to a previous study by amor et al 38 the ammonia monooxygenase enzyme is more sensitive with inhibition of phenol than hydroxylamine oxidoreductase enzyme with the inhibiting rates of 32 2 10 5 respectively simultaneous nitrification denitrification snd efficiency achieved the highest removal of 30 5 when the phenol concentration increased then aob activity decreased 30 1 17 5 at the same time denitrification bacteria increased 7 6 18 2 20 several previous studies indicated that phenol and ammonia could be simultaneously removed by using highly effective activated sludge with removal efficiencies of 80 and 25 respectively 5 7 2 municipal wastewater treatment some municipal wastewater contains highly toxic concentrations of cod bod tss ammonium etc released into the environment these would affect the ecological environment and humans thus urban wastewater management is a current issue of concern iceas technology could be a beneficial choice for treating such effluents several previous studies used iceas technology to treat municipal wastewater with low dissolved carbon concentration including 39 this study looked at the role of temperature and biomass on iceas conducted with synthetic and real municipal wastewater the lab scale trials of 4 0 l with hrt 11 h 15 h 25 h and temperatures 10 c 15 c 25 c the cycle time was 6 h with 5 min of filling 290 min of reactor 60 min of settle and 5 min decant the study indicated that low temperatures and low sludge concentration could apply the partial nitrogen process for treating difficult sewage with cod removal performance of 65 2 when reducing temperature and hrt nitrogen emission will decrease and reduce cod removal efficiency it indicated that iceas can be applied to treat sewage at low temperature 10 25 c with cod removal efficiency of 89 2 synthetic wastewater and 33 0 real wastewater cod removal efficiency was different between synthetic wastewater and real wastewater due to the complexity of real wastewater many ingredients compared with synthetic wastewater in the laboratory the impact of real wastewater on microorganisms is more complex than under optimal conditions in the laboratory when reducing temperature and hrt nitrogen emission will decrease al rekabi et al 40 investigated iceas municipal wastewater treatment run at three aeration periods 4 6 and 8 h the tn cod nh4 tp removals of iceas were slightly better 60 91 83 72 than for the common sbr process 56 87 81 69 increasing aeration time will increase cod due to the reduction of organic carbon substance similar to ammonium removal performance iceas improves conventional sbr technology especially as the continuous flow helps to balance the loading and nutrients that leads to anti shock loading and carbon source shortage however aeration time that was too long resulted in nutrient deficiencies for denitrification thus reducing tn removal cod and nitrogen removal efficiencies increased slowly when aeration increased from 6 to 8 h the microbiological community in iceas cannot remove all the complex organic compounds it is important to chose the appropriate cycle time and aeration time depending on the different wastewater types hidaka et al 41 investigated domestic wastewater treatment and used intermittent aeration sequencing batch reactor with continuous flow the pilot scale model consisted of two 64 m3 reaction tanks do was limited to 0 5 2 mg l by the controller total hydraulic retention time was 22 47 h aeration time 20 45 min or 30 45 min the total reaction time was 90 min with stirring time 60 65 min and aeration time 30 min the influent wastewater contained mlss 4000 mg l cod 100 130 mg l ss 200 400 mg l and tn 40 50 mg l temperature 12 24 8 c the study indicated that optimal operating conditions included do of 0 6 1 mg l cycle time 90 min aeration time stirrer time 25 30 60 65 min in tank 1 and 30 45 60 65 min in tank 2 the effluent water contains bod 5 mg l cod 8 mg l tn 3 mg l and ss 5 mg l with solids retention time srt 10 20 days cod and tn are largely removed by the first reaction tank and the remainder is treated by the second tank the concentration of phosphorous dropped sharply from 5 9 to 0 6 mg l the returned sludge s rate was around 100 200 do concentration was significantly affected during the nitrification and denitrification process low do concentration short time aeration will lead to a increase in denitrification in contrast high do concentration long time aeration will lead to an increase of nitrification reduced denitrification nitrate concentration 10 mg l when do 1 mg l determining the optimal aeration time stirrer time ratio is therefore required 7 3 landfill leachate treatment landfill leachate includes many organics heavy metals xenobiotic compounds and ammonium etc its property is based on the landfill s age solid wastes municipal waste industrial waste etc and climate conditions of the area it contains a large amount of poorly biodegradable compounds 42 that affect the environment and humans when discharged directly into the environment treatment of landfill leachate is therefore necessary before discharge into the environment multiple studies have been undertaken in recent years using the partial nitrogen pn anammox process in iceas to treat leachate wastewater for example one study assessed the role of temperature on the development of microorganisms during the nitrification anammox process using an iceas system with a fixed carrier 43 the cycle time operation of 24 h filling time of 10 min aeration time of 4 h settling time 4 h discharging 10 min do was limited at 2 0 2 4 mg l 1 by the controller this research studied nitrogen removal ratio at 30 c 20 c 15 c and 10 c at 15 c nitrogen removal efficiency increased 9 88 by the presence of denitrification bacteria which have advantages compared to nitrite oxidation bacteria nob and anammox bacteria amx 4 56 aob was 6 05 and the refractory bacteria was 24 38 gabarro et al 7 investigated the fluctuation of the microorganism s community in the anammox for leachate treatment the cycle time was 24 h 20 min of settling and 20 min of decant the cycle time was 100 min with four times repetition including 5 min of the pre anoxic 10 min of filling 5 min of anoxic and 89 min of aerobic do was limited to 2 mgl 1 during aeration and ph was kept below 8 0 by hcl 1 m the result of the research showed the suitability and stability of the pn process for leachate treatment the microorganism community fluctuated slightly depending on the different stirring conditions in the reactor betaproteobacteria and bacteroidetes bacteria showed highest concentration qiu et al 44 investigated the treatment efficiency and microbial abundance of the partial nitrification anammox process for simulated leachate removal filling and draining were conducted by two peristaltic pumps operation cycle time was 360 min including 270 min of reaction phase stirrer aeration rate was 15 30 min with the repetition of 6 times 5 min of filling 15 min of decanting and the hrt was 2 9 days the result showed a nitrite accumulation rate about 80 and tn removal performance of 81 5 which was achieved by anammox bacteria candidatus kuenenia decreasing of the aeration rate will increase the abundance of bacteria genus nitrosomonas and candidatusnitrososphaera by 3 44 during the partial nitration process temperature effects the microbial community and several studies have demonstrated this issue for example gabarro et al 7 indentified effect of temperature on aob during the partial nitration process by using the sbr for landfill leachate treatment in that study the sbr tank of 111 l operated at 25 c and 35 c for 100 min including 10 min of filling and 90 min of reaction do was limited to 2 mg l 1 and ph was kept below 8 0 the result showed that the free ammonium fa and nitrous acid fna are sensitive to temperature the main inhibiting factor to microorganisms at 25 c was fna while both fa and fna factors inhibit biological community at 35 c hellinga et al 24 also indicated that a pn anammox process run at a temperature of 30 35 c promotes the aob process and stronger growth than the nob process besides that the chemical balance process of fa and fna was sensitive to temperature both fa and fna factors inhibited the activity of nob and aob at high concentration miao et al 45 reported the ability to remove nitrogen directly via nitrite in landfill leachate by stored polymers mechanism the landfill leachate in this study contained nh4 concentration of 1000 mg n l and cod n 1 4 total cycle time was 24 h with 5 min of filling 1 h of the settling 5 min of decanting and 1370 min of aeration the result indicated that output tn was 10 mg n l 1 when operating at a c n 4 microorganisms can store the carbon source in the aeration stage to supply electronics for the endogenous denitrification process glycogen storage in the microorganism was calculated about 39 8 several other studies have shown similar results for example zhu et al 46 studied nitrogen removal efficiency by an organic denitrification process and intracellular polymers process of microorganisms in landfill leachate using an anaerobic sequencing batch reactor asbr tank connected to a pulsed sequencing batch reactor psbr tank the wastewater of this study had a bod5 cod ratio 0 5 to 0 7 and c n ratio 7 9 the results proved that cod removal efficiency of asbr was about 83 85 when operating with a cod loading from 0 43 to 0 62 gcod gvss day at the psbr tank tn and cod removal efficiencies were 97 03 98 87 and 89 61 9 73 respectively the research by li et al 47 clarified the role of ph on the partial nitrogen process in landfill leachate treatment by an sbr tank the result showed that the partial nitration process was stable after 182 days operated with tn loading about 0 30 0 89 kg n m3 day no2 n nh4 n ratio 1 30 0 22 no3 concentration 16 9 mg l with high fa low do temperature about 28 5 30 c the pilot scale sbr 48 5 52 l had a cycle time of 30 min a settling time of 10 min and 10 min of decanting li et al 48 indicated the partial nitration process affected the intermittent aeration at the sbr with disadvantages in the composition of landfill leachate the result showed that adjusting hrt and flow ratio produces a stable partial nitrogen process increasing the aeration rate improves the ability to remove nitrogen by a partial nitrogen process output tn was 0 71 0 14 kg n m3 day and output cod was 2 21 0 13 kgcod m3 day the nutrient removal efficiency in middle age of landfill leachate was diluted with municipal wastewater about 15 and used an intermittent aeration system 49 conducted a study in a lab scale system of 4 l srt of 12 days and do of 2 mg l the aerobic time anoxic time examined during cycle times of 24 h and 48 h the result proved that experiments without additional external carbon sources resulted in high tn concentrations in contrast by adding crude glycerol during the anoxic phase enhancing cod n ratio to 5 the highest nh4 n tkn no2 n and no3 n removal were 75 7 75 9 99 9 and 99 9 respectively therefore glycerol is an external carbon to enhance denitrification efficiency inhibit the nitrite accumulating concentration and increase phosphorous removal efficiency after 2 3 h of anoxic treatment this research indicated that diluting landfill leachate wastewater with domestic wastewater will decrease the impact of toxic factors such as salinity metals etc in particular recalculation of ingredients was necessary for treating landfill leachate dilution rates of landfill leachate were 10 15 20 25 30 and achieved the optimal ratio of 15 without using supplement carbon the tkn ammonium and cod removal decreased the accumulation of no3 and no2 bod5 cod ratio and biodegradable organic compounds are factors that strongly affect the denitrification process the free ratio of ammonium and nitric acid strongly affect the oxidation of ammonium and nitrite zhang et al 50 used iceas to treat landfill leachate containing compounds such as ammonium nh4 n 1950 250 mg l scod 1900 mg l and tn 2300 mg l the laboratory scale work used a reactor of 10 l at temperature of 28 3 c and maintained airflow at 70 l h during the aeration stage each cycle consisted of five stages filling intermittent aeration anoxic stirrer sedimentation and decant idle the cycle time was 36 h with 5 min of filling 2 h of aeration 3 5 h of anoxic reaction mixing replaying to end cycle 3 min of decanting and idle do was limited at 0 2 mg l the result showed tn removal of 77 1 with partial nitrification process anammox as shown in eq 14 and nitrogen removal performance of 15 6 with common denitrification process as shown in eq 15 the dom increased in anoxic decreased accumulation of no3 by the denitrification path aob and anaob are two primary bacteria types with 12 99 and 8 32 nitrogen and cod were treated simultaneously 7 4 livestock wastewater livestock wastewater contains significant pollutants such as high cod bod residue of antibiotics etc the high ammonium is generated by anaerobic digestion of organic nitrogen the low carbon nitrogen ratio of swine wastewater will decrease the nitrogen removal efficiency in conventional treatment processes there have been many studies using iceas to treat livestock wastewater types in recent years zheng et al 30 treated residual veterinary antibiotics pig wastewater the purpose of the study was to remove 11 residual veterinary antibiotics at different organic loading rates srts solids retention times and cod tn ratio the removal performance was determined by two factors sludge sorption and biodegradation the result showed that 60 of veterinary antibiotics were degraded and 24 absorbed on activated sludge the residual antibiotics removal in swine wastewater was largely affected by high cod loading which does strongly decrease the veterinary antibiotics removal efficiencies the result indicated that residual veterinary antibiotics removal efficiency was 85 1 when operating at cod loading of 0 17 kgcod m3 day and it was decreased with increasing of cod loading tetracycline is the main antibiotic in anaerobically digested swine wastewater 87 9 was removed at the lowest cod loading 57 5 was degraded and 30 4 was absorded in sludge long srt obviously affects the removal ability of antibiotics such as reducing antibiotic accumulation the cod tn ratio has only a slight influence on antibiotic removal deng et al 51 treated swine slurry wastewater using intermittent aeration system with a full scale plant the result indicated that the anaerobic zone could remove 85 of cod and 5 of ammonium nh4 the cod and ammonium removal efficiencies in the aerobic zone achieved 85 and 98 respectively besides that the research also proved that the dilution of raw swine wastewater created more stable operation in the intermittent aeration system than common sbr because swine digested wastewater has low c n ratio leading to insufficient organic carbon to provide for the biological denitrification process as shown in eq 16 the concentration of ammonium in wastewater did not affect its treatment efficiency the aeration process is better than the standard sbr process reducing hrt and the working volume was only about 27 compared to the asbr process song et al 52 compared tn removal efficiency and advantages of iceas with conventional sbr for swine digested wastewater the research was conducted to explore digestion of swine wastewater with high nh4 low c n ratio 1 6 3 4 bod5 cod ratio 0 35 and cod tn ratio 0 95 the total cycle time was 8 h with 10 min of filling 40 min of non aeration 60 min of aeration replay 4 times 60 min of settling in each cycle do was limited at 0 5 1 5 mg l the result demonstrated the ability to remove tn ammonium and toc iceas performed better than the common sbr with 83 1 96 5 and 89 0 removal respectively with iceas the cod used for denitrification was around 48 7 52 2 higher than the conventional sbr 43 1 47 4 at short hrt and high organic carbon loading the mlss and mlvs increased rapidly an increasing cod tn ratio will significantly enhance ammonium removal efficiency the mechanism to remove tn total nitrogen is similar to ammonium removal tn removal efficiency of iceas was lower than ammonium removal by about 10 15 the high tn removal with low organic nitrogen is an advantage of iceas the ammonification and nitrification process are two main processes that directly influence tn removal performance which is more likely to consume organic carbon than sbr normally the fatty acid substrate favored aob but inhibited the growth of nob when fatty acid concentration is too high this also will inhibit the growth of aob zhang et al 53 examined the ability emission of n2o in iceas with swine digested wastewater treatment the wastewater contained cod 11 540 mg l bod5 2900 mg l tn 4041 mg l c n 2 9 and bod5 cod ratio 0 72 the sbr tank 10 l operating in 8 h with filling continuously 30 min of the aeration repeating 6 times 50 min of the non aeration repeating 6 times settling 40 min draw idle 10 min the result indicated that the accumulation of the n2o gas was highest at the non aeration period with an accumulation rate of around 8 3 during the non aeration periods n2o gas emission was low with only 8 3 at the aeration phase however n2o emission was around 91 7 n2o gas emission is from the heterotrophic denitrification and autotrophic denitrification process which is the first product of the process converting nitrate and nitrite to n2 gas no3 no2 no n2o n2 according to henze et al 54 the accumulation of n2o gas increased at the non aeration phase and decreased at the aeration phase low bod5 n ratio may be due to n2o emissions it proved that organic carbon compounds are important factors for the heterotrophic denitrification process the cod n ratio 5 6 promoted denitrification process completely in contrast if organic carbon substance was insufficient the heterotrophic denitrification was not completed increasing n2o emissions the low do concentration promoted the process of generating n2o through the heterotrophic denitrification pathway by nitrosomonas europaea bacteria besides several other factors it also affects the n2o emissions such as free nitric acid fna and ph high no2 concentration will promote both the nf and df processes zhang et al 55 examined the ability of nutrient removal in pig manure anaerobic digestion using iceas at the pilot scale the results indicated that the cod removal was 89 8 when the organic carbon loading was 1 5 kgcod m3 day with swine wastewater and 99 with synthetic wastewater the partial nitrification efficiency reached 71 79 at a stable stage with a tn removal 76 5 this study also agrees with the study of 56 proved that iceas helps to remove high tn in wastewater with c n ratio sheng et al 57 compared the effectiveness between iceas and conventional sbr in treating swine wastewater the experiment was conducted in three identical cylinder tanks 10 lat 21 32 c the duration was 8 h with 10 min of filling 60 min of settling 400 min of the reaction and 10 min of decanting in the iasbr tank 1 the aerobic anoxic ratio was 60 min 40 min switched four times iasbr 2 was 120 min 80 min two switched times and the sbr tank was 240 min 160 min one switched time the swine digested wastewater contained concentrations of cod 2394 mg l ammonium 577 mg l and tn 1194 mg l this study indicated that the ammonium nitrogen total tn removal efficiencies and the ability to resist tn shock loading of iceas were higher than for normal sbr in addition the ammonium and tn removal efficiencies in iasbr tanks 1 switched four times were higher than in the tank iasbr 2 switched two times the abundance degree of species thauera denitrification microbial in tank iasbr 1 was higher than in the sbr tank with 25 63 of iasbr 1 11 575 of sbr and 11 57 of iasbr 2 switched two times this study demonstrated that with more switched times the abundance of denitrification microbial genus will be promoted nob nitrite oxidizing bacteria nitrobacter was only 0 03 and the ammonium oxidizing bacteria aob genus in iasbr tank was nitrosomonas the removal efficiencies of ammonium in the three reaction tanks were significantly different while the tn removal efficiencies were significantly similar the activity of ammonium oxidizing bacteria was impacted by high free ammonium concentration moreover multiple aerobic anoxic conversion led to the increased removal performance of ammonium and tn the iasbr tank promoted the accumulation of no2 n with low c n wastewater promote aob growth and inhibit nob growth in addition high nh4 n will also promote the nitrite s accumulation the high concentration of free ammonium fa is strongly affected by aob and nob 57 claimed that nob will suffer more than aob at fa above 10 mg l and this completely inhibits the nitrification process the effects of aeration time on the nitrification bacteria community abundance and nitrogen removal performance of an intermittent aeration system in swine digested wastewater were investigated by mota et al 27 the research was conducted in five reaction tanks operated at different aeration stirrer ratio conditions including 1 h 1 h 1 h 3 h 0 5 h 1 5 h 0 5 h 2 h and 1 h 4 h with the presence of aob and nob bacteria in a working volume of 6 l anaerobically digested swine wastewater influent contained nh3 n 197 mg l tkn 296 mg l scod 344 mg l and toc 305 mg l with all reactors operating at the ambient temperature of 25 c and the average ph value about 7 6 7 8 the results showed that the reactor was most abundant at an aeration time of 30 min with nitrosospira rrna when the reactor was operated at the anoxic stage about 3 4 h nitrobacter was lowest compared with others bacteria nitrosomonas sp was presented while aob biomass were not significant at all reactors in the long term at the aeration stage nob was more sensitive than aob the accumulation of nitrite was low at 1 h 4 h reactor partial nitrification through nitrite took place entirely in reactors with aeration time of 4 h ammonia removal efficiency does not depend on the abundance of aob species in the results above iceas shows its high pollutant removal efficiency and advantages compared with conventional activated sludge however it is necessary to compare the performances of iceas with other technologies to make a clearer assessment in the selection of suitable technology for each type of wastewater table 2 compares iceas and other biological treatments in various wastewater types the results show that iceas is very effective in wastewater treatment comparable with mbr and better than some traditional methods 8 conclusion iceas was improved from conventional sbr technology with some advantages such as continuous flow allowing for single basin operation during times of maintenance or periods of low flow uniform loading to all basins aeration and clarification in the same basin and automatic operation system leading to cost savings based on the previous studies it can be concluded that iceas is an advanced system to treat many wastewaters such as domestic wastewater industrial wastewater landfill leachate livestock wastewater or low c n ratio s wastewater iceas is applied for removal of nitrogen and phosphorus conversion processes cod bod5 and toc removal efficiencies were mostly higher than 90 while tn was over 80 optimal conditions in iceas could improve the pollutant removal efficiencies decreases organic loading shock increase the abundance of microorganism community and promote the development of the beneficial bacteria community some advantages of iceas compared to conventional sbr were presented such as less volume required 10 30 less equipment fewer tanks no pre treatment and post treatment energy saving about 60 single basin operation more biological nitrogen removal bnr less external carbon required higher nitrification rate higher organic loading shock resistance in future iceas could be combined with other physicochemical and biological treatment methods to increase the quality of effluent reduce space save costs and reduce energy consumption
