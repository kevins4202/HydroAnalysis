24260,documenting how human pressure on wildlife changes over time is important to minimise potential adverse effects through implementing appropriate management and policy actions however obtaining objective measures of these changes and their potential impacts is often logistically challenging particularly in the natural environment here we developed a modular stochastic model that infers the ratio of actual viewing pressure on wildlife in consecutive time periods years using social media as this medium is widespread and easily accessible pressure was calculated from the number of times individual animals appeared in social media in pre defined time windows accounting for time dependent variables that influence them e g number of people with access to social media formulas for the confidence intervals of viewing pressure ratios were rigorously developed and validated and corresponding uncertainty was quantified we applied the developed framework to calculate changes to wildlife viewing pressure on loggerhead sea turtles caretta caretta at zakynthos island greece before and during the covid 19 pandemic 2019 2021 based on 2646 social media entries our model ensured temporal comparability across years of social media data grouped in time window sizes by correcting for the interannual increase of social media use optimal sizes for these windows were delineated reducing uncertainty while maintaining high time scale resolution the optimal time window was around 7 days during the peak tourist season when more data were available in all three years and 15 days during the low season in contrast raw social media data exhibited clear bias when quantifying changes to viewing pressure with unknown uncertainty the framework developed here allows widely available social media data to be used objectively when quantifying temporal changes to wildlife viewing pressure its modularity allowed viewing pressure to be quantified for all data combined or subsets of data different groups situations or locations and could be applied to any site supporting wildlife exposed to tourism keywords ecotourism monitoring tourism pressure social media stochastic ecological modelling uncertainty quantification data availability code and data used are publicly available in the following github repository https github com sadda turtles covid 1 introduction as awareness of the ecological economical and intrinsic value of wildlife has grown in recent decades könig et al 2020 demand to observe animals in their natural environment and consequently wildlife viewing has also risen moorhouse et al 2015 to address any potential adverse effects that this activity has on wild animals i e elevated risk of injury from boat collisions during viewing or behavioural changes documentation of its impacts are widespread in both terrestrial and marine environments burgin and hardiman 2015 larson et al 2016 könig et al 2020 however wildlife viewing pressure is not consistent within or across years moorhouse et al 2015 particularly in areas supporting seasonal migrants such as breeding humpback whales and sea turtles even within the same population animals are not randomly distributed in time or space with certain individuals in hotspots or residents being disproportionately targeted semeniuk et al 2009 christiansen and lusseau 2014 another source of temporal fluctuation in viewing pressure is due to changes on the numbers of actual human observers this issue which has been exemplified by the recent covid 19 pandemic via the unprecedented absence of ecotourism in hotspots globally rutz et al 2020 bates et al 2021 march et al 2021 schofield et al 2021 as a result analytical approaches that capture temporal variation in both animal presence and viewing records are required to quantify viewing impacts on at multiple scales from individuals to groups and populations moorhouse et al 2015 birk et al 2020 western et al 2020 marion et al 2020 by understanding how these pressures change within and across years relevant actions that promote conservation efforts and mitigate disturbance could be implemented the rise of social media image sharing and the widespread use of mobile phone cameras has generated an extra level of pressure on wildlife through huge demand for selfies and close up images with animals resulting in close encounters between humans and wild animals that have potential negative impacts semeniuk et al 2009 christiansen and lusseau 2014 lenzi et al 2020 papafitsoros et al 2021 molyneaux et al 2021 van hamme et al 2021 yet because viewing wild animals is intrinsically linked with taking photographs and videos social media is also being explored as a useful tool to inform conservation science dickinson et al 2012 di minin et al 2015 toivonen et al 2019 in particular wildlife imagery initially uploaded online for purposes other than facilitating conservation studies e g to social media to share personal experiences is being increasingly applied for science under various names such as conservation culturomics ladle et al 2016 passive crowdsourcing ghermandi and sinclair 2019 iecology jarić et al 2020 and passive citizen science edwards et al 2021 such data are being used to quantitatively evaluate interactions between humans and wildlife in both terrestrial e g mountain gorillas gorilla beringei van hamme et al 2021 orangutans pongo abelii molyneaux et al 2021 and marine environments e g sea turtles caretta caretta papafitsoros et al 2021 monk seals neomonachus schauinslandi sullivan et al 2019 this application of social media has several advantages over typical researcher based approaches for instance to measure how ecotourism places pressure on wildlife simple counts of tourist numbers frequenting focal sites or subset of tourists participating on organised activities do not necessarily reflect the actual true viewing pressure that animals individuals or groups are subjected to within a larger population as operator strategies and animal behaviour and movement patterns also have an effect semeniuk et al 2009 christiansen and lusseau 2014 this issue becomes even more challenging when considering nonorganised and nonregulated activities where encounters are often incidental papafitsoros et al 2021 in comparison counting the number of times that animals appear on social media in given time frames could be used to quantify actual viewing pressure on animals more objectively particularly when exploring how pressure changes over time seasons years however systematic approaches to make such comparisons over time based on social media are lacking barros et al 2019 rice and pan 2021 such approaches are needed because the frequency at which animals are recorded is influenced by the location and number of people accessing social media platforms plus the availability of cameras and smartphones toivonen et al 2019 ghermandi and sinclair 2019 for instance the number of instagram a popular sharing social media platform users globally has risen from around two million in 2010 to more than one billion in 2020 https www statista com statistics 183585 instagram number of global users consequently any change in pressure based on comparing the number of animal images uploaded to this platform must be corrected to account for this increase challenges also exist because the flow of information from a given human animal interaction to it appearing in social media is governed by many factors tenkanen et al 2017 jarić et al 2020 edwards et al 2021 not all observed animals are captured on camera nor do all those captured on camera actually appear on social media tenkanen et al 2017 ultimately the number of human animal encounters appearing on social media tend to be several orders of magnitude lower than the actual number originally observed wood et al 2013 papafitsoros et al 2021 even when social media data can be compared temporally i e records are consistent certainty varies with the number of data samples observations with confidence being higher when sightings are higher consistency of an estimator lehmann and casella 2006 thus it is important to model the uncertainty that exists in this flow of information and establish the minimum number of social media records required to ensure interpretations have high confidence such models are currently absent from the literature for social media but parallels exist for in other fields huang et al 2017 here we developed a rigorous and mathematically consistent framework to quantify temporal changes in the number of human animal encounters using social media data we focused on quantifying uncertainty in these changes we then applied the framework to quantify changes to wildlife viewing pressure on loggerhead sea turtles zakynthos island greece during the course of covid 19 global travel disruption 2019 to 2021 zakynthos island supports both a major population of breeding loggerheads which are seasonally present from may to august and a small population of year round resident turtles immature and adults the turtles frequenting the island are subjected to intense ecotourism viewing pressure from may to october papafitsoros et al 2021 this sea turtle population forms part of the mediterranean loggerhead sea turtle population which is considered conservation dependent based on data assimilated from long term conservation efforts casale et al 2018 however because our framework only requires targeted social media mining for photographs and videos of animals in a given focal area it could be widely applied to other sites where humans interact with and photograph wildlife provided these interactions are accompanied by a substantial consistent and timely social media activity the information provided by our model could be used for instance by management agencies of wildlife habitats we anticipate that as the data mining of social media becomes automated this information could be made available in real time informing managers of noticeable changes to viewing pressure of specific threatened animal groups prompting action to mitigate disturbance i e dynamic management through increasing the reliability of using social media based methods to quantify wildlife tourism pressure our model facilitates the integration of this global citizen based phenomenon as a science tool to identify and mitigate adverse effects of human wildlife interactions 2 methods model development and validation 2 1 real and detected viewing pressures we developed a rigorous method to compare human viewing pressure on wildlife in a given year against other years based on detected observations from social media the following parameters were first defined real viewing pressure v real number of times that an animal at a focal site is observed by a human it is difficult to obtain this value because it requires continuous observation of the same animal s photographs of individuals v photo number of times that a photograph video of an animal at a focal site is recorded by definition this number is smaller than or equal to v real detected viewing pressure v detected number of times for which a person recorded an image photograph video of an animal and uploaded that image on a public social media account together with detectable identifiers e g hashtags we used the term entry for such images by definition this number is smaller than or equal to v photo these parameters were evaluated for all animals that were observed across all situations locations and years however certain animal groups observation conditions locations or years could also be separated to evaluate different types of pressures at different temporal scales we focused on comparing v real across years using the corresponding v detected which was assumed to be known following a targeted search in social media 2 2 transition probabilities to link v detected and v real we delineated three transition probabilities when a single observation of an individual animal is made i e one person observes one animal p 1 is the probability that the person took at least one photograph video of this animal p 2 is the probability that the person has a public social media account p 3 is the probability that given that the tourist has a public social media account they uploaded a photograph video of the animal to it with detectable identifiers the relationship of v real v photo v detected with p 1 p 2 p 3 is shown in fig 1 furthermore fig 2 presents a schematic of the relationship between the real and detected viewing pressure as well as the role of the confidence interval formula 4 described in the next sections from the definitions above it follows that the approximate value of v photo is equal to 1 v photo p 1 v real thus p 1 is used to transfer from v real to v photo to transfer from v photo to v detected we separated the transition probability into whether the photographer 1 has a public social media account and 2 uploaded the photograph video with detectable identifiers the probability that both components are satisfied is equal to p 2 p 3 thus p 2 p 3 is used to pass from v photo to v detected meaning that v detected is approximately equal to 2 v detected p 2 p 3 v photo by combining eqs 1 and 2 we end up with v detected being approximately equal to 3 v detected p 1 p 2 p 3 v real p v real where p denotes the product of the three probabilities in other words p is the probability that all the three following events occur given that an animal is observed by a human i the observer took at least one photograph video of the animal ii the observer has a public social media account iii the observer uploaded the photograph video to that public social media account with detectable identifiers given that the observer has a public social account these three events will occur with probabilities p 1 p 2 p 3 respectively and they occur simultaneously with probability p p 1 p 2 p 3 some assumptions must be made on the transition probabilities p 1 p 2 p 3 id independence assumption we assumed that p 1 p 2 p 3 do not depend on the identity of the observed animal for instance certain individuals are not expected to have higher or lower probabilities of being photographed videoed than other individuals or for these images to be uploaded on social media time independence assumption we assumed p 1 p 3 would be constant across time for instance given that a person observes an animal this person is as likely to record the viewed animal on a device with a camera in all years the assumption of time independence for p 1 implies that the availability of photographic equipment mobile phones cameras underwater cameras remains approximately stable across the selected timeframe in contrast p 2 is considered time dependent because social media users increase annually and so the probability that a person has a social media account increases thus we used the notation p 2 year 1 p 2 year 2 etc condition of observation independence assumption we assumed that p 2 and p 3 do not depend on the condition in which the observation took place for instance a person would upload photographs videos with the same probability regardless of the condition where or how in which the observation took place at the focal site different conditions could be locations underwater vs boat based for marine life means of recording normal cameras vs drones or time of the day daytime vs nighttime however in certain situations i e when viewing marine wildlife p 1 is likely condition dependent this is because more images are obtained from boat viewings compared to underwater viewings as devices with cameras that can be used underwater tend to be more expensive and so used less thus we used the notation p 1 condition 1 p 1 condition 2 etc outcome of viewings independence assumption we assumed that the viewing of an animal resulting in a photograph video that is uploaded to social media would not depend on the corresponding event of a different viewing i e each viewing is independent for instance when two viewings are done by two different persons it can be assumed that they act independently however if the same person observes two different animals this independence is lost for instance if that person uploads a photograph video of the first animal it is more likely that they upload a photograph video for the second animal as well hence for this assumption to be true a person would have to observe just one animal which is not necessarily the case this assumption can be validated by quantifying the number of entries uploaded to unique social media accounts at sites where this is not the case i e where a single person can view multiple animals the model must be interpreted with caution 2 3 linking detected viewing pressure to real viewing pressure and related uncertainty quantification the previous section argued that v detected equals approximately p v real where p p 1 p 2 p 3 to be more precise from a modelling perspective v real is a deterministic quantity whereas v detected is a random variable that follows the binomial distribution with parameters v real and p denoted as bi v real p this means that v detected is the number of successes of v real independent experiments each of which has success probability p here success is defined as the event in which a photograph video was taken and uploaded with hashtags and experiments are defined as animal viewings we stated that v detected is approximately equal to p v real this is because p v real is the expected value of v detected however because v detected is distributed around its expected value with nonzero variance its true value is not known we can only observe its realisation denoted by v detected which is the number of detected images in social media this distinction is important from a modelling point of view the conceptual difference between v detected and v detected can be understood if a hypothetical experiment is repeated by going back in time even though the probability that v detected belongs to a certain interval remains the same v detected its realisation would differ due to randomness in practice also due to unquantified difficult to track factors given some detected entries in two years v detected year 1 and v detected year 2 referring to a given time window condition of observation and group of animals we wanted to quantify the uncertainty of the corresponding real viewing pressure change i e how much larger smaller v real year 2 is compared to v real year 1 given an acceptable level of error 0 α 1 we aimed to find an interval i such that v real year 2 v real year 1 belongs to the interval i with probability 1 α specifically we showed that the confidence interval i is defined by the following inequalities 4 v detected year 2 v detected year 1 p year 1 p year 2 e k 1 v detected year 2 1 v detected year 1 v real year 2 v real year 1 v detected year 2 v detected year 1 p year 1 p year 2 e k 1 v detected year 2 1 v detected year 1 where k is the value of the quantile function of the standard normal distribution at level 1 α 2 for instance for α 0 05 which we fix henceforth we have k 1 96 supplementary material a shows how the confidence interval 4 was derived and associated justification in brief the confidence interval was derived using three assumptions i relatively large values for v real year 1 v real year 2 ii relatively small values for p year 1 p year 2 and iii the observed values v detected year 1 v detected year 2 being close to their respective means supplementary material b explains these assumptions the confidence interval 4 implies the point estimate most probable value for real pressure ratio v real year 2 v real year 1 is equal to 5 v detected year 2 v detected year 1 p year 1 p year 2 which is natural as it is simply the ratio of the detected pressure v detected year 2 v detected year 1 adjusted by the ratio of probabilities p year 2 p year 1 even though the true probabilities p year 1 and p year 2 are not known due to our assumptions we estimate their ratio as 6 p year 2 p year 1 p 1 year 2 p 2 year 2 p 3 year 2 p 1 year 1 p 2 year 1 p 3 year 1 p 1 p 2 year 2 p 3 p 1 p 2 year 1 p 3 p 2 year 2 p 2 year 1 n platform year 2 n platform year 1 that is as the ratio of the global number of users of the fixed social media platform in consecutive time frames i e number of users in year 1 and year 2 denoted by n platform year 1 and n platform year 2 respectively 2 4 a simple illustration of the confidence interval to illustrate the confidence interval 4 we provide an example with v detected 2021 200 and v detected 2020 100 as the number of detected entries if we assume that the number of social media users did not change i e n platform year 1 n platform year 2 then the confidence interval based on formula 4 is calculated as 1 57 v real 2021 v real 2020 2 54 if the number of observations increases e g v detected 2021 2000 and v detected 2020 1000 then the new confidence interval shrinks to 1 85 v real 2021 v real 2020 2 16 in both cases the confidence interval lies around the point estimate v detected 2021 v detected 2020 200 100 2 due to 5 as the number of entries increases the confidence interval shrinks increasing its robustness and confidence we have in it however if the number of social media users doubled then the confidence interval would shrink by a factor of two to 0 93 v real 2021 v real 2020 1 08 this is logical as the same real pressure with two times the number of instagram users should result in twice as many entries and consequently double the observed pressure 2 5 confidence interval validation because three additional assumptions were required to derive the confidence interval 4 we verified its accuracy and validated its use we computed the confidence interval 4 for a series of v detected year 1 and v detected year 2 and compared the outputs with the true confidence interval computed via simulations supplementary material d presents the procedure used to compute the true confidence interval in brief it was based on the knowledge of transition probabilities which are not known for real data and were chosen as p year 1 p year 2 for the simulation once we computed these two confidence intervals we computed their iou intersection over union as a comparison metric iou 0 represented no intersection our estimated confidence interval is not accurate and iou 1 represented a perfect alignment our estimated confidence interval is perfectly accurate fig 3 presents the outputs of this procedure based on v detected year 1 and v detected year 2 for all possible combinations of numbers between 1 and 50 if either number of detected entries v detected year 1 and v detected year 2 is small then our estimated and true confidence interval had small iou and the estimated uncertainty is not trustworthy however this discrepancy is rectified when the number of detected entries rises fig 3 right quantifies this and shows the minimum number of detected entries v detected year 1 and v detected year 2 so that iou reaches a certain threshold for example 5 entries are sufficient to obtain an iou of 75 whereas 10 entries produce an iou of 86 thus the results are trustworthy once the number of entries for both are greater than or equal to 5 of note we also performed simulations with p year 1 p year 2 with similar conclusions and for the sake of simplicity the resulting graph is symmetric we presented here the case p year 1 p year 2 2 6 empirical application of the model 2 6 1 study site we tested the model by applying it to a site laganas bay zakynthos island greece supporting large numbers of loggerhead sea turtles caretta caretta subject to intense ecotourism fig 4 the site supports around 300 breeding adult females seasonally april august margaritoulis 2005 margaritoulis et al 2011 schofield et al 2017 and around 40 year round residents of mostly juveniles and adult males schofield et al 2020 papafitsoros et al 2021 the island is a popular holiday destination in summer may october with over 850 000 visitors 2018 2019 on average papafitsoros et al 2021 there is a well established wildlife watching industry where tourists observe turtles on organised boat tours fig 4 this industry is estimated to service 180 000 tourists over 9000 trips per year generating an annual revenue of more than 2 7 million euros schofield et al 2015 papafitsoros et al 2021 2 6 2 collection of social media records social media records were collected for 2019 2020 and 2021 following the methods described in papafitsoros et al 2021 the first year represented a typical tourism year 2019 and the next two years 2020 and 2021 were heavily and mildly impacted by covid 19 respectively when tourism levels were limited by global travel restrictions schofield et al 2021 instagram was selected over other social media types because of its popularity and convenient search framework via hashtags and places we searched for entries using specific hashtags and places related to the study site and species the list of hashtags used is provided in the supplementary material of papafitsoros et al 2021 for an entry to be detected the user must have a public profile on instagram and the entry must be uploaded using one of the specified hashtags the search was performed on at least once weekly from 1 may to 31 october each year with regular retrospective searches to minimise missed entries we did not record entries from previous seasons or those used as advertisements by tour operators throwback posts and re posts from a different account duplicate posts were detected by inspecting the captions and were excluded from our dataset for each entry we recorded the date that it was uploaded we previously showed that more than 80 of entries are uploaded within 2 days of being captured papafitsoros et al 2021 this information was obtained because a proportion of instagram entries 74 and 97 entries in 2018 and 2019 respectively showed both the date they had been uploaded and the actual dates that they had been recorded in the caption of the entry observation conditions that could be detected from social media were considered allowing the uploaded entries to be distinguished based on them i e underwater boat type of device location here we only selected entries taken from a boat i e organised tours and private hire boats which defines the condition of the observation of note at this site tourists remain on board boats during organised boat tours and take photographs of sea turtles when they surface to breathe using standard commercial digital cameras or mobile phones 2 6 3 number of instagram users and visitors to zakynthos the number of annual instagram users was obtained from the statista website https www statista com statistics 183585 instagram number of global users accessed on 14 01 2022 see also supplementary table 3 the number of arrivals to zakynthos airport were obtained for each month may october 2019 2021 from the hellenic civil aviation authority caa http www ypa gr for 2019 2020 the number of daily airport arrivals was also available because daily airport arrivals in 2021 were not available we employed a mass conserving interpolation approach to generate a series of simulated daily arrivals the sum of which over all days is the same with the original sum over months https uk mathworks com matlabcentral fileexchange 99404 conservative regridding this approach was validated using 2019 and 2020 airport arrivals for which the real number of daily arrivals was available 2 6 4 comparing real viewing pressure ratios with baseline values we investigated how our developed framework provided more reliable information on changes to viewing pressure from year 1 to another year i e year 2 we compared the estimated ratio of v real with the corresponding confidence intervals to two baseline values constant 1 and ratio of visitor arrivals constant 1 represented equal viewing pressure in year 1 and year 2 when the ratio of v real was above below value 1 then viewing pressure increased decreased from year 1 to year 2 the second baseline value was the ratio of visitor arrivals we considered the ratio of the airport arrivals to be representative of the ratio of the total number of people present at this focal site and observing sea turtles the comparison of the v real ratio to arrivals tested to what degree v real is directly proportional to the number of visitors when the ratio of v real was not equal to the arrival ratio changes to v real might have also been driven by additional factors not just the change in the number of tourist arrivals e g more organised tours operating between years when the ratio of v real was above resp below the arrival ratio this meant that changes to v real were higher resp lower than that predicted by changes to tourist numbers when assuming a simple linear relationship between the number of visitors and number of animal viewings this could happen due to other factors that affect real viewing pressure apart from the number of visitors which differ in a non predictable way from year 1 to year 2 for instance small fluctuations in ecotourism activity might arise due to sudden severe weather events or disruptions in the normal functioning of social media platforms 3 results 3 1 overview of instagram records and tourist numbers we recorded 2646 instagram entries from boats for 2019 2020 and 2021 n 1382 n 387 and n 877 respectively fig 5 supplementary table 1 the total number of visitors in 2019 was 1 288 651 airport and port combined versus 386 756 70 lower in 2020 due to covid 19 pandemic travel restrictions in 2021 there were 803 868 visitors 107 8 higher than 2020 but still 37 6 lower than 2019 supplementary table 2 3 2 model versus raw data we investigated three quantities as estimates for the ratio of the ratio v real year 2 v real year 1 raw data ratio v detected year 2 v detected year 1 point estimate 5 ratio v detected year 2 v detected year 1 n insta year 2 n insta year 1 associated confidence interval 4 the raw data ratio was a natural candidate for estimating the real pressure ratio however unlike the other two estimates changes to the number of instagram users and uncertainty of that estimate were not considered therefore confidence interval 4 might be more reliable than the raw data ratio estimate for example we compared boat viewing pressure before 2019 and during the covid 19 pandemic 2021 for these three quantities when aggregating viewing images at 3 and 7 day intervals fig 6 for the 3 day aggregation window the raw data ratios v detected 2021 v detected 2019 were primarily below 1 apart from three time windows mid may late june mid july see three arrows in fig 6 suggesting that boat viewing pressure rose from 2019 to 2021 for these specific 3 day windows however when adjusting for changes in the number of instagram users the corresponding point estimate value of these 3 day windows decreased close to 1 with the confidence interval being above and below 1 thus the number of data detected entries was insufficient to make objective inferences for this narrow time interval in contrast when aggregating viewing images to 7 day intervals the confidence intervals for june september remained below 1 indicating that boat pressure change could be inferred with high certainty and that it was lower in 2020 than 2019 we note that for visualisation purposes we selected the 2020 2019 and 2021 2019 ratios i e keeping the year 2019 as the denominator and we did not work with the inverse ratios in order for the ratios to mostly fall between zero and one 3 3 effect of time aggregations on the uncertainty of real pressure ratio to evaluate how aggregating image records in different time intervals impacted uncertainty in the real pressure ratio we evaluated different time windows 1 7 15 184 days entire season fig 7 for 2020 2019 and 2021 2019 data based on daily records led to extremely high uncertainty for the estimated real pressure ratio very large confidence intervals and should not be used fig 7 certainty increased as the data were aggregated into larger time intervals with 7 and 15 day intervals providing higher confidence for july september as the corresponding detected entries were higher fig 8 the real pressure ratio during this period was below 1 with high certainty as all confidence intervals were below this number the arrival ratio closely followed the real pressure ratio indicating proportionality between real boat pressure and the number of tourists frequenting the site based on the entire season 184 days compared to 2019 boat observation pressure was 25 and 50 lower in 2020 and 2021 respectively with very high certainty due to the small confidence interval fig 9 provides a further visualisation on how the size of the confidence intervals varied with the aggregation window number of days we aggregated the days of each month based on this window for example for a 4 day aggregation window a month with 30 days was split into 7 windows excluding the last 2 days then for each month may october we computed the average size of the confidence interval for each window defined as the ratio upper over the lower bound of the interval with 1 corresponding to the smallest possible confidence interval supplementary material c during july september and june 2021 2019 the confidence interval had a smaller average width than october due to the larger number of detected entries in parallel the width decreased in all months as the aggregation window increased for july september high visitor season of 2021 2019 a 7 day aggregation window represents an optimal balance between achieving high certainty confidence interval size 1 5 with sufficiently fine time scale resolution since aggregation windows of 7 days do not cause the width of the confidence interval to significantly decrease further in contrast a 15 day window was needed for july september for 2020 2019 ratio and june 2021 2019 due to fewer entries for october 2020 2019 and 2021 2019 the same certainty was achieved by setting an aggregation window of 30 days 4 discussion a key issue of passive crowdsourcing iecology raw data and associated analysis is determining uncertainty to improve objective interpretation isaac et al 2014 jarić et al 2020 as such the present study provided a rigorous framework for using social media imagery with confidence to infer temporal changes within and across years in wildlife watching pressure we showed that confidence increased when integrating multiple days this framework modelled the flow of information from a human animal interaction event to that event appearing in social media in a detectable way this was achieved by introducing the notions of real and detected viewing pressure linking them via transition probabilities and showing how temporal changes in the former can be estimated by temporal changes in the latter detected viewing pressure was modelled as a random variable allowing uncertainty in real viewing pressure change to be quantified by rigorously deriving confidence intervals through applying the model at a site supporting large scale sea turtle ecotourism we demonstrated its advantages over simply using raw data i e simple ratio of detected animal entries in given time periods through increasing the reliability of using social media based methods to quantify wildlife tourism pressure our model facilitates the use of social media as a scientific tool providing evidence based information on human pressure our study delineated appropriate time windows to analyse social media data temporally allowing robust comparison across years despite highly different visitor levels due to covid 19 the optimal aggregation window balance of high confidence and high temporal resolution for images at our study site was 7 days during the peak period with more days being needed during the low periods due to fewer images our results supported those of tenkanen et al 2017 who showed that social media captured temporal variation in national park visitation rates at a monthly scale but was challenging on a daily basis due to fewer social media records other studies arbitrarily grouped information into monthly periods for instance molyneaux et al 2021 compared the monthly number of photographs posted on instagram before and after the onset of the covid 19 pandemic to quantify variation in interactions between tourists and orangutans barros et al 2019 observed that flickr geotagged data have enough information to capture daily weekly and monthly distribution patterns of visitors of spanish national parks but did not perform temporal comparisons of visitor numbers across years by implementing our approach studies could maximise social media data by selecting appropriate aggregation windows of sufficient temporal granularity guaranteeing certainty in interpretations this modularity of our model allows more refined versions to be developed as knowledge of its key constituents becomes available for instance estimates of the ratio p 2 year 2 p 2 year 1 could be improved by directly incorporating the number of users that belong to the main demographic characteristics nationality age group culture of visitors to a focal site väisänen et al 2021 or if available the total number of social media posts made from that site the time independence assumption of transition probability p 1 could also be refined i e availability of photographic equipment across years by incorporating information on the yearly ratios of global or more refined demographically sales of equipment e g smartphones underwater cameras associated to marine wildlife viewing our model could easily incorporate such refinements by adjusting the corresponding ratio formulas our model also allowed temporal changes to viewing pressure of specific animal individuals groups to be focused on by combining social media images with photo identification records examples of this include analysis of specific african wild dog dens cloutier et al 2021 gorilla family groups molyneaux et al 2021 and resident foraging sea turtles versus migratory turtles papafitsoros et al 2021 this flexibility is particularly important because wildlife viewing pressure is not equally distributed across all animals present at a given site or time period certain individuals are often subjected to disproportionally higher viewing pressure due to ecotourism activities incidentally or deliberately targeting these groups particularly resident animals semeniuk et al 2009 christiansen and lusseau 2014 schofield et al 2015 papafitsoros et al 2021 thus social media could be used to tease out this information quantitatively and to introduce more appropriate watching practices and conservation measures the selected social media platform also influenced interpretation ghermandi et al 2020 particularly as the demographics of visitors and social media use change over time ideally social media data should reflect actual human animal interactions while minimising user induced biases in parallel to revealing temporal variability in these interactions for this reason we used instagram because it captures real life human activity effectively tenkanen et al 2017 hausmann et al 2018 this attribute allowed us to objectively identify temporal variation in viewing pressure alternatively flickr has been widely used to infer spatial information on national park visitations due to its easily accessible geotagged photographs wood et al 2013 barros et al 2019 ghermandi et al 2020 edwards et al 2021 yet its temporal correlation with ground truthed data is lower than of instagram tenkanen et al 2017 other platforms could also be used in our model like youtube otsuka and yamakoshi 2020 taklis et al 2020 however larger time aggregation windows might be required to account for lower temporal correlation between the time of viewing and time of video uploading in contrast the demographics of instagram users as well as those of more recently popular platforms e g tiktok are not always representative of visitors to a focal site for instance generally younger people use other social media forms heikinheimo et al 2017 hausmann et al 2018 furthermore the country of origin might also affect social media use ghermandi and sinclair 2019 biases might also be self diminishing such as if hypothetically smartphone availability increased across years whereas instagram or any social media use decreases in this case the net output of social media content might remain constant even though the processes that govern information flow from the focal site to social media platforms are time dependent as with other technologies involving the remote collection of data passive crowdsourcing social media data should be validated or ground truthed using robust field data to guarantee conservation policies are informed appropriately jarić et al 2020 since information flow from the human animal encounter to it being detectable in social media changes across sites validation should be site specific the current study was methods based and so ground truthing was not the primary focus however our outputs closely aligned with previous studies at our site schofield et al 2015 papafitsoros et al 2021 the ground truthing of our model would involve estimating p which would allow v real to be directly estimated at a given time interval rather than only the ratio in two time periods this approach could provide a useful comparison of the ratio estimation we provide here however determining p remains challenging p could be estimated by using questionnaires targeting visitors at focal sites investigating whether visitors observed wildlife and uploaded any images on social media or by quantifying actual viewing pressure using direct observations over time regular repetition of such surveys is necessary to determine the time dependence of p particularly in the long term i e across years finally for our model to be applied successfully three minimal parameters are required at a given site high levels of interactions and high levels of social media activity timely social media activity and extra information to validate the model first the activity of humans observing interacting and photographing wildlife must be accompanied by substantial social media activity this is required since as we showed high numbers of social media entries increase the confidence we have on the estimated temporal change of the real viewing pressure thus while our framework is suitable at sites where large scale tourism and large numbers of wildlife coexist 20 individuals it is unlikely to be useful in areas low levels of where human wildlife interactions are low e g scientific expeditions in remote areas second social media activity should be timely our model works best in areas where people upload images of their encounters with animals within 1 2 days of making observations if this is not the case a correction for time delay should be incorporated in the model this phenomenon depends on the social media platform used and site characteristics good available internet connection for instance people on vacation are more likely to share personal moments almost immediately bayer et al 2016 thus sites that support tourist activities are more likely to be suitable for our framework thirdly the site should allow for some validation of the model in any of the ways described in the previous paragraph sites where numbers of visitors are recorded either via park visitation ticketing schemes or simply by recording the number of arrivals in main entrance points as it was the case for the site we considered here are more suitable than sites where there is no information on visitation numbers is available whatsoever 5 conclusion most protected areas globally receive visitors that produce social media content related to them tenkanen et al 2017 leading to the emergence of conservation culturomics iecology passive crowdsourcing these records are typically used to study spatiotemporal visitation patterns and interaction of humans with the natural environment and identify potential threats to wildlife sullivan et al 2019 jarić et al 2020 edwards et al 2021 papafitsoros et al 2021 molyneaux et al 2021 van hamme et al 2021 cloutier et al 2021 however to accomplish this social media related biases and uncertainties must be overcome with the current study making an important step towards this we modelled the flow of information from human animal encounter to its appearance in social media and inferred temporal changes in the number of encounters from temporal changes to corresponding social media imagery we focused on quantifying uncertainty underlying such inferences and identifying aggregation windows that combined increased temporal granularity to reduce uncertainty we expect that continued advances in automating the mining of social data and machine learning will facilitate the creation of well curated and meaningful datasets väisänen et al 2021 tuia et al 2022 combined with our framework such advances would increase the number of studies using social media data to infer human impacts on wildlife in different situations credit authorship contribution statement kostas

24260,documenting how human pressure on wildlife changes over time is important to minimise potential adverse effects through implementing appropriate management and policy actions however obtaining objective measures of these changes and their potential impacts is often logistically challenging particularly in the natural environment here we developed a modular stochastic model that infers the ratio of actual viewing pressure on wildlife in consecutive time periods years using social media as this medium is widespread and easily accessible pressure was calculated from the number of times individual animals appeared in social media in pre defined time windows accounting for time dependent variables that influence them e g number of people with access to social media formulas for the confidence intervals of viewing pressure ratios were rigorously developed and validated and corresponding uncertainty was quantified we applied the developed framework to calculate changes to wildlife viewing pressure on loggerhead sea turtles caretta caretta at zakynthos island greece before and during the covid 19 pandemic 2019 2021 based on 2646 social media entries our model ensured temporal comparability across years of social media data grouped in time window sizes by correcting for the interannual increase of social media use optimal sizes for these windows were delineated reducing uncertainty while maintaining high time scale resolution the optimal time window was around 7 days during the peak tourist season when more data were available in all three years and 15 days during the low season in contrast raw social media data exhibited clear bias when quantifying changes to viewing pressure with unknown uncertainty the framework developed here allows widely available social media data to be used objectively when quantifying temporal changes to wildlife viewing pressure its modularity allowed viewing pressure to be quantified for all data combined or subsets of data different groups situations or locations and could be applied to any site supporting wildlife exposed to tourism keywords ecotourism monitoring tourism pressure social media stochastic ecological modelling uncertainty quantification data availability code and data used are publicly available in the following github repository https github com sadda turtles covid 1 introduction as awareness of the ecological economical and intrinsic value of wildlife has grown in recent decades könig et al 2020 demand to observe animals in their natural environment and consequently wildlife viewing has also risen moorhouse et al 2015 to address any potential adverse effects that this activity has on wild animals i e elevated risk of injury from boat collisions during viewing or behavioural changes documentation of its impacts are widespread in both terrestrial and marine environments burgin and hardiman 2015 larson et al 2016 könig et al 2020 however wildlife viewing pressure is not consistent within or across years moorhouse et al 2015 particularly in areas supporting seasonal migrants such as breeding humpback whales and sea turtles even within the same population animals are not randomly distributed in time or space with certain individuals in hotspots or residents being disproportionately targeted semeniuk et al 2009 christiansen and lusseau 2014 another source of temporal fluctuation in viewing pressure is due to changes on the numbers of actual human observers this issue which has been exemplified by the recent covid 19 pandemic via the unprecedented absence of ecotourism in hotspots globally rutz et al 2020 bates et al 2021 march et al 2021 schofield et al 2021 as a result analytical approaches that capture temporal variation in both animal presence and viewing records are required to quantify viewing impacts on at multiple scales from individuals to groups and populations moorhouse et al 2015 birk et al 2020 western et al 2020 marion et al 2020 by understanding how these pressures change within and across years relevant actions that promote conservation efforts and mitigate disturbance could be implemented the rise of social media image sharing and the widespread use of mobile phone cameras has generated an extra level of pressure on wildlife through huge demand for selfies and close up images with animals resulting in close encounters between humans and wild animals that have potential negative impacts semeniuk et al 2009 christiansen and lusseau 2014 lenzi et al 2020 papafitsoros et al 2021 molyneaux et al 2021 van hamme et al 2021 yet because viewing wild animals is intrinsically linked with taking photographs and videos social media is also being explored as a useful tool to inform conservation science dickinson et al 2012 di minin et al 2015 toivonen et al 2019 in particular wildlife imagery initially uploaded online for purposes other than facilitating conservation studies e g to social media to share personal experiences is being increasingly applied for science under various names such as conservation culturomics ladle et al 2016 passive crowdsourcing ghermandi and sinclair 2019 iecology jarić et al 2020 and passive citizen science edwards et al 2021 such data are being used to quantitatively evaluate interactions between humans and wildlife in both terrestrial e g mountain gorillas gorilla beringei van hamme et al 2021 orangutans pongo abelii molyneaux et al 2021 and marine environments e g sea turtles caretta caretta papafitsoros et al 2021 monk seals neomonachus schauinslandi sullivan et al 2019 this application of social media has several advantages over typical researcher based approaches for instance to measure how ecotourism places pressure on wildlife simple counts of tourist numbers frequenting focal sites or subset of tourists participating on organised activities do not necessarily reflect the actual true viewing pressure that animals individuals or groups are subjected to within a larger population as operator strategies and animal behaviour and movement patterns also have an effect semeniuk et al 2009 christiansen and lusseau 2014 this issue becomes even more challenging when considering nonorganised and nonregulated activities where encounters are often incidental papafitsoros et al 2021 in comparison counting the number of times that animals appear on social media in given time frames could be used to quantify actual viewing pressure on animals more objectively particularly when exploring how pressure changes over time seasons years however systematic approaches to make such comparisons over time based on social media are lacking barros et al 2019 rice and pan 2021 such approaches are needed because the frequency at which animals are recorded is influenced by the location and number of people accessing social media platforms plus the availability of cameras and smartphones toivonen et al 2019 ghermandi and sinclair 2019 for instance the number of instagram a popular sharing social media platform users globally has risen from around two million in 2010 to more than one billion in 2020 https www statista com statistics 183585 instagram number of global users consequently any change in pressure based on comparing the number of animal images uploaded to this platform must be corrected to account for this increase challenges also exist because the flow of information from a given human animal interaction to it appearing in social media is governed by many factors tenkanen et al 2017 jarić et al 2020 edwards et al 2021 not all observed animals are captured on camera nor do all those captured on camera actually appear on social media tenkanen et al 2017 ultimately the number of human animal encounters appearing on social media tend to be several orders of magnitude lower than the actual number originally observed wood et al 2013 papafitsoros et al 2021 even when social media data can be compared temporally i e records are consistent certainty varies with the number of data samples observations with confidence being higher when sightings are higher consistency of an estimator lehmann and casella 2006 thus it is important to model the uncertainty that exists in this flow of information and establish the minimum number of social media records required to ensure interpretations have high confidence such models are currently absent from the literature for social media but parallels exist for in other fields huang et al 2017 here we developed a rigorous and mathematically consistent framework to quantify temporal changes in the number of human animal encounters using social media data we focused on quantifying uncertainty in these changes we then applied the framework to quantify changes to wildlife viewing pressure on loggerhead sea turtles zakynthos island greece during the course of covid 19 global travel disruption 2019 to 2021 zakynthos island supports both a major population of breeding loggerheads which are seasonally present from may to august and a small population of year round resident turtles immature and adults the turtles frequenting the island are subjected to intense ecotourism viewing pressure from may to october papafitsoros et al 2021 this sea turtle population forms part of the mediterranean loggerhead sea turtle population which is considered conservation dependent based on data assimilated from long term conservation efforts casale et al 2018 however because our framework only requires targeted social media mining for photographs and videos of animals in a given focal area it could be widely applied to other sites where humans interact with and photograph wildlife provided these interactions are accompanied by a substantial consistent and timely social media activity the information provided by our model could be used for instance by management agencies of wildlife habitats we anticipate that as the data mining of social media becomes automated this information could be made available in real time informing managers of noticeable changes to viewing pressure of specific threatened animal groups prompting action to mitigate disturbance i e dynamic management through increasing the reliability of using social media based methods to quantify wildlife tourism pressure our model facilitates the integration of this global citizen based phenomenon as a science tool to identify and mitigate adverse effects of human wildlife interactions 2 methods model development and validation 2 1 real and detected viewing pressures we developed a rigorous method to compare human viewing pressure on wildlife in a given year against other years based on detected observations from social media the following parameters were first defined real viewing pressure v real number of times that an animal at a focal site is observed by a human it is difficult to obtain this value because it requires continuous observation of the same animal s photographs of individuals v photo number of times that a photograph video of an animal at a focal site is recorded by definition this number is smaller than or equal to v real detected viewing pressure v detected number of times for which a person recorded an image photograph video of an animal and uploaded that image on a public social media account together with detectable identifiers e g hashtags we used the term entry for such images by definition this number is smaller than or equal to v photo these parameters were evaluated for all animals that were observed across all situations locations and years however certain animal groups observation conditions locations or years could also be separated to evaluate different types of pressures at different temporal scales we focused on comparing v real across years using the corresponding v detected which was assumed to be known following a targeted search in social media 2 2 transition probabilities to link v detected and v real we delineated three transition probabilities when a single observation of an individual animal is made i e one person observes one animal p 1 is the probability that the person took at least one photograph video of this animal p 2 is the probability that the person has a public social media account p 3 is the probability that given that the tourist has a public social media account they uploaded a photograph video of the animal to it with detectable identifiers the relationship of v real v photo v detected with p 1 p 2 p 3 is shown in fig 1 furthermore fig 2 presents a schematic of the relationship between the real and detected viewing pressure as well as the role of the confidence interval formula 4 described in the next sections from the definitions above it follows that the approximate value of v photo is equal to 1 v photo p 1 v real thus p 1 is used to transfer from v real to v photo to transfer from v photo to v detected we separated the transition probability into whether the photographer 1 has a public social media account and 2 uploaded the photograph video with detectable identifiers the probability that both components are satisfied is equal to p 2 p 3 thus p 2 p 3 is used to pass from v photo to v detected meaning that v detected is approximately equal to 2 v detected p 2 p 3 v photo by combining eqs 1 and 2 we end up with v detected being approximately equal to 3 v detected p 1 p 2 p 3 v real p v real where p denotes the product of the three probabilities in other words p is the probability that all the three following events occur given that an animal is observed by a human i the observer took at least one photograph video of the animal ii the observer has a public social media account iii the observer uploaded the photograph video to that public social media account with detectable identifiers given that the observer has a public social account these three events will occur with probabilities p 1 p 2 p 3 respectively and they occur simultaneously with probability p p 1 p 2 p 3 some assumptions must be made on the transition probabilities p 1 p 2 p 3 id independence assumption we assumed that p 1 p 2 p 3 do not depend on the identity of the observed animal for instance certain individuals are not expected to have higher or lower probabilities of being photographed videoed than other individuals or for these images to be uploaded on social media time independence assumption we assumed p 1 p 3 would be constant across time for instance given that a person observes an animal this person is as likely to record the viewed animal on a device with a camera in all years the assumption of time independence for p 1 implies that the availability of photographic equipment mobile phones cameras underwater cameras remains approximately stable across the selected timeframe in contrast p 2 is considered time dependent because social media users increase annually and so the probability that a person has a social media account increases thus we used the notation p 2 year 1 p 2 year 2 etc condition of observation independence assumption we assumed that p 2 and p 3 do not depend on the condition in which the observation took place for instance a person would upload photographs videos with the same probability regardless of the condition where or how in which the observation took place at the focal site different conditions could be locations underwater vs boat based for marine life means of recording normal cameras vs drones or time of the day daytime vs nighttime however in certain situations i e when viewing marine wildlife p 1 is likely condition dependent this is because more images are obtained from boat viewings compared to underwater viewings as devices with cameras that can be used underwater tend to be more expensive and so used less thus we used the notation p 1 condition 1 p 1 condition 2 etc outcome of viewings independence assumption we assumed that the viewing of an animal resulting in a photograph video that is uploaded to social media would not depend on the corresponding event of a different viewing i e each viewing is independent for instance when two viewings are done by two different persons it can be assumed that they act independently however if the same person observes two different animals this independence is lost for instance if that person uploads a photograph video of the first animal it is more likely that they upload a photograph video for the second animal as well hence for this assumption to be true a person would have to observe just one animal which is not necessarily the case this assumption can be validated by quantifying the number of entries uploaded to unique social media accounts at sites where this is not the case i e where a single person can view multiple animals the model must be interpreted with caution 2 3 linking detected viewing pressure to real viewing pressure and related uncertainty quantification the previous section argued that v detected equals approximately p v real where p p 1 p 2 p 3 to be more precise from a modelling perspective v real is a deterministic quantity whereas v detected is a random variable that follows the binomial distribution with parameters v real and p denoted as bi v real p this means that v detected is the number of successes of v real independent experiments each of which has success probability p here success is defined as the event in which a photograph video was taken and uploaded with hashtags and experiments are defined as animal viewings we stated that v detected is approximately equal to p v real this is because p v real is the expected value of v detected however because v detected is distributed around its expected value with nonzero variance its true value is not known we can only observe its realisation denoted by v detected which is the number of detected images in social media this distinction is important from a modelling point of view the conceptual difference between v detected and v detected can be understood if a hypothetical experiment is repeated by going back in time even though the probability that v detected belongs to a certain interval remains the same v detected its realisation would differ due to randomness in practice also due to unquantified difficult to track factors given some detected entries in two years v detected year 1 and v detected year 2 referring to a given time window condition of observation and group of animals we wanted to quantify the uncertainty of the corresponding real viewing pressure change i e how much larger smaller v real year 2 is compared to v real year 1 given an acceptable level of error 0 α 1 we aimed to find an interval i such that v real year 2 v real year 1 belongs to the interval i with probability 1 α specifically we showed that the confidence interval i is defined by the following inequalities 4 v detected year 2 v detected year 1 p year 1 p year 2 e k 1 v detected year 2 1 v detected year 1 v real year 2 v real year 1 v detected year 2 v detected year 1 p year 1 p year 2 e k 1 v detected year 2 1 v detected year 1 where k is the value of the quantile function of the standard normal distribution at level 1 α 2 for instance for α 0 05 which we fix henceforth we have k 1 96 supplementary material a shows how the confidence interval 4 was derived and associated justification in brief the confidence interval was derived using three assumptions i relatively large values for v real year 1 v real year 2 ii relatively small values for p year 1 p year 2 and iii the observed values v detected year 1 v detected year 2 being close to their respective means supplementary material b explains these assumptions the confidence interval 4 implies the point estimate most probable value for real pressure ratio v real year 2 v real year 1 is equal to 5 v detected year 2 v detected year 1 p year 1 p year 2 which is natural as it is simply the ratio of the detected pressure v detected year 2 v detected year 1 adjusted by the ratio of probabilities p year 2 p year 1 even though the true probabilities p year 1 and p year 2 are not known due to our assumptions we estimate their ratio as 6 p year 2 p year 1 p 1 year 2 p 2 year 2 p 3 year 2 p 1 year 1 p 2 year 1 p 3 year 1 p 1 p 2 year 2 p 3 p 1 p 2 year 1 p 3 p 2 year 2 p 2 year 1 n platform year 2 n platform year 1 that is as the ratio of the global number of users of the fixed social media platform in consecutive time frames i e number of users in year 1 and year 2 denoted by n platform year 1 and n platform year 2 respectively 2 4 a simple illustration of the confidence interval to illustrate the confidence interval 4 we provide an example with v detected 2021 200 and v detected 2020 100 as the number of detected entries if we assume that the number of social media users did not change i e n platform year 1 n platform year 2 then the confidence interval based on formula 4 is calculated as 1 57 v real 2021 v real 2020 2 54 if the number of observations increases e g v detected 2021 2000 and v detected 2020 1000 then the new confidence interval shrinks to 1 85 v real 2021 v real 2020 2 16 in both cases the confidence interval lies around the point estimate v detected 2021 v detected 2020 200 100 2 due to 5 as the number of entries increases the confidence interval shrinks increasing its robustness and confidence we have in it however if the number of social media users doubled then the confidence interval would shrink by a factor of two to 0 93 v real 2021 v real 2020 1 08 this is logical as the same real pressure with two times the number of instagram users should result in twice as many entries and consequently double the observed pressure 2 5 confidence interval validation because three additional assumptions were required to derive the confidence interval 4 we verified its accuracy and validated its use we computed the confidence interval 4 for a series of v detected year 1 and v detected year 2 and compared the outputs with the true confidence interval computed via simulations supplementary material d presents the procedure used to compute the true confidence interval in brief it was based on the knowledge of transition probabilities which are not known for real data and were chosen as p year 1 p year 2 for the simulation once we computed these two confidence intervals we computed their iou intersection over union as a comparison metric iou 0 represented no intersection our estimated confidence interval is not accurate and iou 1 represented a perfect alignment our estimated confidence interval is perfectly accurate fig 3 presents the outputs of this procedure based on v detected year 1 and v detected year 2 for all possible combinations of numbers between 1 and 50 if either number of detected entries v detected year 1 and v detected year 2 is small then our estimated and true confidence interval had small iou and the estimated uncertainty is not trustworthy however this discrepancy is rectified when the number of detected entries rises fig 3 right quantifies this and shows the minimum number of detected entries v detected year 1 and v detected year 2 so that iou reaches a certain threshold for example 5 entries are sufficient to obtain an iou of 75 whereas 10 entries produce an iou of 86 thus the results are trustworthy once the number of entries for both are greater than or equal to 5 of note we also performed simulations with p year 1 p year 2 with similar conclusions and for the sake of simplicity the resulting graph is symmetric we presented here the case p year 1 p year 2 2 6 empirical application of the model 2 6 1 study site we tested the model by applying it to a site laganas bay zakynthos island greece supporting large numbers of loggerhead sea turtles caretta caretta subject to intense ecotourism fig 4 the site supports around 300 breeding adult females seasonally april august margaritoulis 2005 margaritoulis et al 2011 schofield et al 2017 and around 40 year round residents of mostly juveniles and adult males schofield et al 2020 papafitsoros et al 2021 the island is a popular holiday destination in summer may october with over 850 000 visitors 2018 2019 on average papafitsoros et al 2021 there is a well established wildlife watching industry where tourists observe turtles on organised boat tours fig 4 this industry is estimated to service 180 000 tourists over 9000 trips per year generating an annual revenue of more than 2 7 million euros schofield et al 2015 papafitsoros et al 2021 2 6 2 collection of social media records social media records were collected for 2019 2020 and 2021 following the methods described in papafitsoros et al 2021 the first year represented a typical tourism year 2019 and the next two years 2020 and 2021 were heavily and mildly impacted by covid 19 respectively when tourism levels were limited by global travel restrictions schofield et al 2021 instagram was selected over other social media types because of its popularity and convenient search framework via hashtags and places we searched for entries using specific hashtags and places related to the study site and species the list of hashtags used is provided in the supplementary material of papafitsoros et al 2021 for an entry to be detected the user must have a public profile on instagram and the entry must be uploaded using one of the specified hashtags the search was performed on at least once weekly from 1 may to 31 october each year with regular retrospective searches to minimise missed entries we did not record entries from previous seasons or those used as advertisements by tour operators throwback posts and re posts from a different account duplicate posts were detected by inspecting the captions and were excluded from our dataset for each entry we recorded the date that it was uploaded we previously showed that more than 80 of entries are uploaded within 2 days of being captured papafitsoros et al 2021 this information was obtained because a proportion of instagram entries 74 and 97 entries in 2018 and 2019 respectively showed both the date they had been uploaded and the actual dates that they had been recorded in the caption of the entry observation conditions that could be detected from social media were considered allowing the uploaded entries to be distinguished based on them i e underwater boat type of device location here we only selected entries taken from a boat i e organised tours and private hire boats which defines the condition of the observation of note at this site tourists remain on board boats during organised boat tours and take photographs of sea turtles when they surface to breathe using standard commercial digital cameras or mobile phones 2 6 3 number of instagram users and visitors to zakynthos the number of annual instagram users was obtained from the statista website https www statista com statistics 183585 instagram number of global users accessed on 14 01 2022 see also supplementary table 3 the number of arrivals to zakynthos airport were obtained for each month may october 2019 2021 from the hellenic civil aviation authority caa http www ypa gr for 2019 2020 the number of daily airport arrivals was also available because daily airport arrivals in 2021 were not available we employed a mass conserving interpolation approach to generate a series of simulated daily arrivals the sum of which over all days is the same with the original sum over months https uk mathworks com matlabcentral fileexchange 99404 conservative regridding this approach was validated using 2019 and 2020 airport arrivals for which the real number of daily arrivals was available 2 6 4 comparing real viewing pressure ratios with baseline values we investigated how our developed framework provided more reliable information on changes to viewing pressure from year 1 to another year i e year 2 we compared the estimated ratio of v real with the corresponding confidence intervals to two baseline values constant 1 and ratio of visitor arrivals constant 1 represented equal viewing pressure in year 1 and year 2 when the ratio of v real was above below value 1 then viewing pressure increased decreased from year 1 to year 2 the second baseline value was the ratio of visitor arrivals we considered the ratio of the airport arrivals to be representative of the ratio of the total number of people present at this focal site and observing sea turtles the comparison of the v real ratio to arrivals tested to what degree v real is directly proportional to the number of visitors when the ratio of v real was not equal to the arrival ratio changes to v real might have also been driven by additional factors not just the change in the number of tourist arrivals e g more organised tours operating between years when the ratio of v real was above resp below the arrival ratio this meant that changes to v real were higher resp lower than that predicted by changes to tourist numbers when assuming a simple linear relationship between the number of visitors and number of animal viewings this could happen due to other factors that affect real viewing pressure apart from the number of visitors which differ in a non predictable way from year 1 to year 2 for instance small fluctuations in ecotourism activity might arise due to sudden severe weather events or disruptions in the normal functioning of social media platforms 3 results 3 1 overview of instagram records and tourist numbers we recorded 2646 instagram entries from boats for 2019 2020 and 2021 n 1382 n 387 and n 877 respectively fig 5 supplementary table 1 the total number of visitors in 2019 was 1 288 651 airport and port combined versus 386 756 70 lower in 2020 due to covid 19 pandemic travel restrictions in 2021 there were 803 868 visitors 107 8 higher than 2020 but still 37 6 lower than 2019 supplementary table 2 3 2 model versus raw data we investigated three quantities as estimates for the ratio of the ratio v real year 2 v real year 1 raw data ratio v detected year 2 v detected year 1 point estimate 5 ratio v detected year 2 v detected year 1 n insta year 2 n insta year 1 associated confidence interval 4 the raw data ratio was a natural candidate for estimating the real pressure ratio however unlike the other two estimates changes to the number of instagram users and uncertainty of that estimate were not considered therefore confidence interval 4 might be more reliable than the raw data ratio estimate for example we compared boat viewing pressure before 2019 and during the covid 19 pandemic 2021 for these three quantities when aggregating viewing images at 3 and 7 day intervals fig 6 for the 3 day aggregation window the raw data ratios v detected 2021 v detected 2019 were primarily below 1 apart from three time windows mid may late june mid july see three arrows in fig 6 suggesting that boat viewing pressure rose from 2019 to 2021 for these specific 3 day windows however when adjusting for changes in the number of instagram users the corresponding point estimate value of these 3 day windows decreased close to 1 with the confidence interval being above and below 1 thus the number of data detected entries was insufficient to make objective inferences for this narrow time interval in contrast when aggregating viewing images to 7 day intervals the confidence intervals for june september remained below 1 indicating that boat pressure change could be inferred with high certainty and that it was lower in 2020 than 2019 we note that for visualisation purposes we selected the 2020 2019 and 2021 2019 ratios i e keeping the year 2019 as the denominator and we did not work with the inverse ratios in order for the ratios to mostly fall between zero and one 3 3 effect of time aggregations on the uncertainty of real pressure ratio to evaluate how aggregating image records in different time intervals impacted uncertainty in the real pressure ratio we evaluated different time windows 1 7 15 184 days entire season fig 7 for 2020 2019 and 2021 2019 data based on daily records led to extremely high uncertainty for the estimated real pressure ratio very large confidence intervals and should not be used fig 7 certainty increased as the data were aggregated into larger time intervals with 7 and 15 day intervals providing higher confidence for july september as the corresponding detected entries were higher fig 8 the real pressure ratio during this period was below 1 with high certainty as all confidence intervals were below this number the arrival ratio closely followed the real pressure ratio indicating proportionality between real boat pressure and the number of tourists frequenting the site based on the entire season 184 days compared to 2019 boat observation pressure was 25 and 50 lower in 2020 and 2021 respectively with very high certainty due to the small confidence interval fig 9 provides a further visualisation on how the size of the confidence intervals varied with the aggregation window number of days we aggregated the days of each month based on this window for example for a 4 day aggregation window a month with 30 days was split into 7 windows excluding the last 2 days then for each month may october we computed the average size of the confidence interval for each window defined as the ratio upper over the lower bound of the interval with 1 corresponding to the smallest possible confidence interval supplementary material c during july september and june 2021 2019 the confidence interval had a smaller average width than october due to the larger number of detected entries in parallel the width decreased in all months as the aggregation window increased for july september high visitor season of 2021 2019 a 7 day aggregation window represents an optimal balance between achieving high certainty confidence interval size 1 5 with sufficiently fine time scale resolution since aggregation windows of 7 days do not cause the width of the confidence interval to significantly decrease further in contrast a 15 day window was needed for july september for 2020 2019 ratio and june 2021 2019 due to fewer entries for october 2020 2019 and 2021 2019 the same certainty was achieved by setting an aggregation window of 30 days 4 discussion a key issue of passive crowdsourcing iecology raw data and associated analysis is determining uncertainty to improve objective interpretation isaac et al 2014 jarić et al 2020 as such the present study provided a rigorous framework for using social media imagery with confidence to infer temporal changes within and across years in wildlife watching pressure we showed that confidence increased when integrating multiple days this framework modelled the flow of information from a human animal interaction event to that event appearing in social media in a detectable way this was achieved by introducing the notions of real and detected viewing pressure linking them via transition probabilities and showing how temporal changes in the former can be estimated by temporal changes in the latter detected viewing pressure was modelled as a random variable allowing uncertainty in real viewing pressure change to be quantified by rigorously deriving confidence intervals through applying the model at a site supporting large scale sea turtle ecotourism we demonstrated its advantages over simply using raw data i e simple ratio of detected animal entries in given time periods through increasing the reliability of using social media based methods to quantify wildlife tourism pressure our model facilitates the use of social media as a scientific tool providing evidence based information on human pressure our study delineated appropriate time windows to analyse social media data temporally allowing robust comparison across years despite highly different visitor levels due to covid 19 the optimal aggregation window balance of high confidence and high temporal resolution for images at our study site was 7 days during the peak period with more days being needed during the low periods due to fewer images our results supported those of tenkanen et al 2017 who showed that social media captured temporal variation in national park visitation rates at a monthly scale but was challenging on a daily basis due to fewer social media records other studies arbitrarily grouped information into monthly periods for instance molyneaux et al 2021 compared the monthly number of photographs posted on instagram before and after the onset of the covid 19 pandemic to quantify variation in interactions between tourists and orangutans barros et al 2019 observed that flickr geotagged data have enough information to capture daily weekly and monthly distribution patterns of visitors of spanish national parks but did not perform temporal comparisons of visitor numbers across years by implementing our approach studies could maximise social media data by selecting appropriate aggregation windows of sufficient temporal granularity guaranteeing certainty in interpretations this modularity of our model allows more refined versions to be developed as knowledge of its key constituents becomes available for instance estimates of the ratio p 2 year 2 p 2 year 1 could be improved by directly incorporating the number of users that belong to the main demographic characteristics nationality age group culture of visitors to a focal site väisänen et al 2021 or if available the total number of social media posts made from that site the time independence assumption of transition probability p 1 could also be refined i e availability of photographic equipment across years by incorporating information on the yearly ratios of global or more refined demographically sales of equipment e g smartphones underwater cameras associated to marine wildlife viewing our model could easily incorporate such refinements by adjusting the corresponding ratio formulas our model also allowed temporal changes to viewing pressure of specific animal individuals groups to be focused on by combining social media images with photo identification records examples of this include analysis of specific african wild dog dens cloutier et al 2021 gorilla family groups molyneaux et al 2021 and resident foraging sea turtles versus migratory turtles papafitsoros et al 2021 this flexibility is particularly important because wildlife viewing pressure is not equally distributed across all animals present at a given site or time period certain individuals are often subjected to disproportionally higher viewing pressure due to ecotourism activities incidentally or deliberately targeting these groups particularly resident animals semeniuk et al 2009 christiansen and lusseau 2014 schofield et al 2015 papafitsoros et al 2021 thus social media could be used to tease out this information quantitatively and to introduce more appropriate watching practices and conservation measures the selected social media platform also influenced interpretation ghermandi et al 2020 particularly as the demographics of visitors and social media use change over time ideally social media data should reflect actual human animal interactions while minimising user induced biases in parallel to revealing temporal variability in these interactions for this reason we used instagram because it captures real life human activity effectively tenkanen et al 2017 hausmann et al 2018 this attribute allowed us to objectively identify temporal variation in viewing pressure alternatively flickr has been widely used to infer spatial information on national park visitations due to its easily accessible geotagged photographs wood et al 2013 barros et al 2019 ghermandi et al 2020 edwards et al 2021 yet its temporal correlation with ground truthed data is lower than of instagram tenkanen et al 2017 other platforms could also be used in our model like youtube otsuka and yamakoshi 2020 taklis et al 2020 however larger time aggregation windows might be required to account for lower temporal correlation between the time of viewing and time of video uploading in contrast the demographics of instagram users as well as those of more recently popular platforms e g tiktok are not always representative of visitors to a focal site for instance generally younger people use other social media forms heikinheimo et al 2017 hausmann et al 2018 furthermore the country of origin might also affect social media use ghermandi and sinclair 2019 biases might also be self diminishing such as if hypothetically smartphone availability increased across years whereas instagram or any social media use decreases in this case the net output of social media content might remain constant even though the processes that govern information flow from the focal site to social media platforms are time dependent as with other technologies involving the remote collection of data passive crowdsourcing social media data should be validated or ground truthed using robust field data to guarantee conservation policies are informed appropriately jarić et al 2020 since information flow from the human animal encounter to it being detectable in social media changes across sites validation should be site specific the current study was methods based and so ground truthing was not the primary focus however our outputs closely aligned with previous studies at our site schofield et al 2015 papafitsoros et al 2021 the ground truthing of our model would involve estimating p which would allow v real to be directly estimated at a given time interval rather than only the ratio in two time periods this approach could provide a useful comparison of the ratio estimation we provide here however determining p remains challenging p could be estimated by using questionnaires targeting visitors at focal sites investigating whether visitors observed wildlife and uploaded any images on social media or by quantifying actual viewing pressure using direct observations over time regular repetition of such surveys is necessary to determine the time dependence of p particularly in the long term i e across years finally for our model to be applied successfully three minimal parameters are required at a given site high levels of interactions and high levels of social media activity timely social media activity and extra information to validate the model first the activity of humans observing interacting and photographing wildlife must be accompanied by substantial social media activity this is required since as we showed high numbers of social media entries increase the confidence we have on the estimated temporal change of the real viewing pressure thus while our framework is suitable at sites where large scale tourism and large numbers of wildlife coexist 20 individuals it is unlikely to be useful in areas low levels of where human wildlife interactions are low e g scientific expeditions in remote areas second social media activity should be timely our model works best in areas where people upload images of their encounters with animals within 1 2 days of making observations if this is not the case a correction for time delay should be incorporated in the model this phenomenon depends on the social media platform used and site characteristics good available internet connection for instance people on vacation are more likely to share personal moments almost immediately bayer et al 2016 thus sites that support tourist activities are more likely to be suitable for our framework thirdly the site should allow for some validation of the model in any of the ways described in the previous paragraph sites where numbers of visitors are recorded either via park visitation ticketing schemes or simply by recording the number of arrivals in main entrance points as it was the case for the site we considered here are more suitable than sites where there is no information on visitation numbers is available whatsoever 5 conclusion most protected areas globally receive visitors that produce social media content related to them tenkanen et al 2017 leading to the emergence of conservation culturomics iecology passive crowdsourcing these records are typically used to study spatiotemporal visitation patterns and interaction of humans with the natural environment and identify potential threats to wildlife sullivan et al 2019 jarić et al 2020 edwards et al 2021 papafitsoros et al 2021 molyneaux et al 2021 van hamme et al 2021 cloutier et al 2021 however to accomplish this social media related biases and uncertainties must be overcome with the current study making an important step towards this we modelled the flow of information from human animal encounter to its appearance in social media and inferred temporal changes in the number of encounters from temporal changes to corresponding social media imagery we focused on quantifying uncertainty underlying such inferences and identifying aggregation windows that combined increased temporal granularity to reduce uncertainty we expect that continued advances in automating the mining of social data and machine learning will facilitate the creation of well curated and meaningful datasets väisänen et al 2021 tuia et al 2022 combined with our framework such advances would increase the number of studies using social media data to infer human impacts on wildlife in different situations credit authorship contribution statement kostas

24261,taking into account of a rapidly growing literature studying the negative effects of changes in animal behaviour induced by human activities on ecological dynamics biodiversity preservation and human well being we model the interaction between a population of humans and a population of animals by means of an evolutionary game in such a game we assume that humans can adopt two alternative behaviours strategies one with a high environmental impact h i and the other with a low impact l i animals also have two alternative behaviours they can behave in a typical t or non typical n t way the former corresponds to the natural strategy animals would typically adopt in the absence of human interference e g hunting prey while the latter can be seen as an adaptive behaviour adopted by animals to defend themselves from the negative consequences of human action or to opportunistically benefit of food resources that human activity may provide as a by product the analysis of our model shows that the adoption process of the strategies h i l i n t t can generate a great variety of dynamic regimes even if the ecological context we consider is very simple the main purpose of this work is to propose a new research line in ecological modelling and to highlight a policy issue that has been largely ignored thus far how to link the battle against biodiversity loss with the fight against species behavioural typicality loss keywords animal behaviour anthropogenic environmental changes typical behaviour evolutionary game data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction the mathematical models that analyse the impact of human activities on ecological dynamics see among many others antoci et al 2005 vasilieva 2015 focus on the analysis of their impact on the number of individuals of each species and on the coevolution of populations of different species interacting with each other these models do not explicitly take into account possible changes in animal behaviour induced by human activities and their consequences for ecological dynamics biodiversity and human well being although a rapidly growing literature is addressing these issues a classic example is that of the seagulls species who find today large quantities of anthropogenic foods in landfills and this often induce them to move toward big cities or their surrounding areas where landfills can be more easily found see e g auman et al 2011 parra torres et al 2020 carmona et al 2021 schell et al 2021 spelt et al 2021 graells et al 2022 sotillo et al 2022 however ecological literature illustrate several other examples some works focus on large carnivores gray wolves coyotes bears etc in that they are widely distributed their predatory behaviour strongly affects ecosystems and many of them live in close proximity to humans see among the others newsome et al 2017 ellington and gehrt 2019 petroelje et al 2019 zeller et al 2019 ciucci et al 2020 another example is the development of nocturnal crop foraging behaviour in communities of chimpanzees see krief et al 2014 mclennan et al 2017 gruber et al 2019 to avoid interaction with humans martınez abraın et al 2019 provide numerous examples showing the increase in the frequency of fearless behaviours in populations of mammals and birds in southern european countries due to relaxed persecution toward wildlife combined with the large scale abandonment of rural livelihoods during the last 3 4 decades plummer et al 2019 study the effects of feeding wild birds in urban areas of britain streicker and allgeier 2016 analyse the effects on foraging behaviour and rabies transmission by vampire bats due to the proliferation of livestock togera et al 2018 study the availability and distribution of food resources in urban areas as driver of wild boar movement patterns other examples can be found in oro et al 2013 and in the literature cited therein such behavioural adaptation processes can have serious consequences for ecological systems and can be considered as an index of environmental degradation 1 1 heavy reliance by apex predators on anthropogenic food subsidies is an indicator of ecosystem degradation newsome et al 2017 in fact they may have negative impacts on human well being in two ways the first concerns the direct damage due to the increased human animal interaction road accidents caused by crossing wildlife see e g sàenz de santa maría and tellerá 2015 in air accidents caused by flocks of birds see e g thorpe 2016 transmission of diseases see e g tompkins et al 2011 etc the second concerns the benefit to humans deriving from the observation of animal species in their natural habitats there is no doubt that it is better to observe a seagull fishing in the sea than to observe one eating in an urban waste dump or a bear moving in the woods than a bear feeding on food provided by tourists changes in the behaviour of individuals of animal species can also be induced by human activities aimed at protecting them for example cortés avizanda et al 2016 highlight the negative effects on the ecological balance due to the introduction of supplementary feeding stations vulture restaurants aimed at avoiding the extinction of large avian scavengers this paper aims to model the change in animal behaviour induced by human activity and the feedback effects that this change may have on human activity it provides an example of the classical approach of evolutionary games in the spirit of the seminal book evolution and the theory of games published by john maynard smith at 40 years from its publication in 1982 the context analysed is extremely simple in particular we only consider two interacting populations one of humans and one of animals as we will see in the next section the two populations play an evolutionary game in particular we assume that humans can adopt two alternative behaviours strategies one with a high environmental impact h i and the other with a low impact l i animals also may adopt two alternative behaviours they can behave in a typical t or non typical n t way the former corresponds to the natural strategy animals would typically adopt in the absence of human interference e g hunting prey while the latter can be seen as an adaptive behaviour adopted by animals to defend themselves from the negative consequences of human action pollution habitat destruction extinction of natural prey etc or to opportunistically benefit of resources that human activity may provide as a by product food shelters nesting sites etc in the model we assume that the relative performance of the n t behaviour compared to the t one increases as the share of humans adopting h i increases the analysis of our model shows that the coevolution of the strategies adopted by the two types of players humans and animals can generate a wide variety of equilibrium states in some of these the two populations specialize by adopting only one of the two possible strategies for example only h i and n t are adopted in the populations of humans and animals respectively while in others the coexistence of all available strategies can be observed to the best of our knowledge the first model that takes into account the effect of human behaviour on the typicality of animal behaviour is the work of antoci et al 2021 where an optimal economic growth model is proposed in which a social planner maximizes the utility of economic agents by taking into account the effects of their choices on the typicality of animal behaviour in such work the level of typicality of animal behaviour is measured by an index of typicality x which depends negatively on the amount of goods produced and consumed by economic agents and positively on the defensive expenditures implemented by the social planner in order to induce animals to behave typically in this context antoci et al 2021 show that there cannot exist an optimal trajectory along which the accumulated physical capital and the quantities of goods produced and consumed grow indefinitely in fact such a trajectory would imply a well being loss for humans resulting from the reduction in typicality of behaviour of animals that would not be compensated for by the growth in the quantity of goods produced and consumed in this paper we approach the study of the spread of non typical behaviour by animals through a disaggregated approach that is unlike in antoci et al 2021 we explicitly model the process of adoption of non typical behaviour by animals in response to human choices as indicated in the conclusions of this paper one of the possible further research step could be to integrate the two different approaches by introducing an equation modelling the process of adoption of alternative strategies by animals into an optimal economic growth model the following is a breakdown of the article s structure section 2 presents the set up of the model section 3 focuses on the equilibrium points of ecological dynamics and performs numerical simulations section 4 provides conclusions and appendix mathematical appendix contains the stability analysis of the equilibrium points 2 set up of the model let us consider a population game all humans and animals interact together with two populations one of animals belonging to a species s and one of humans each human has two available strategies a low environmental impact strategy l i to produce and consume low quantities of goods to adopt non polluting technologies to hunt without dogs etc and a high environmental impact strategy h i to produce and consume high quantities of goods to adopt polluting technologies to hunt with dogs etc individuals of species s can adopt two alternative behaviours strategies t and n t the t strategy represents typical behaviour such a behaviour performs better than the alternative one n t when a sufficiently high proportion of humans adopt the low impact l i strategy in the opposite case the n t strategy becomes more rewarding for the s species in other words individuals adopting n t behaviour are less vulnerable than those adopting t to the spread of the high impact strategy h i in the population of humans so the n t strategy can be interpreted as an adaptive behaviour adopted by individuals to defend themselves against the negative impact generated by the humans high impact strategy h i t and n t strategies can also be interpreted as choices of alternative places mountain vs valley forest vs city etc where to live to complete the description of the basic hypotheses that characterize the model let us also assume that humans at least those adopting the low impact l i strategy prefer s individuals adopting t to s individuals adopting n t for example they prefer seagulls fishing for sardines at sea to those eating in landfills we indicate with the variable x t the share of humans adopting the h i strategy at time t 0 and with the variable y t the share of individuals of the species s adopting the n t strategy at time t therefore 1 x t 0 and 1 y t 0 so 1 x t and 1 y x represent respectively the share of humans adopting the l i strategy and the share of animals adopting the t strategy let us assume that the payoffs of t and n t which can be interpreted as a fitness measure of t and n t are respectively expressed by the functions 1 π n t x y a x b y c y 2 2 π t x y d x e 1 y f 1 y 2 where b c d e f are strictly positive parameters while a is a parameter that may assume both positive and negative values seagulls that eat in landfills benefit from the arrival of more waste the negative effects due to congestion are modelled by the squared terms f 1 y 2 and c y 2 which may prevail over the positive effects represented by the terms e 1 y and b y when the shares 1 y and y are sufficiently high according to such a modelling choice the payoffs of n t and t strategies initially increase as their respective adoption shares increase and then possibly starts to decrease let assume a d this hypothesis models the lower vulnerability of n t adopters to the impact generated by humans adopting h i similarly let us assume that the payoffs of the h i and l i strategies are respectively expressed by the functions 3 π h i x y α β x 4 π l i x y γ δ x ɛ y where α γ ɛ 0 while the parameters β and δ may be both positive and negative they represent the effects of the spread of the h i strategy on the payoffs of humans adopting h i and l i respectively for simplicity we have assumed that only the payoff of humans adopting the low impact l i strategy is negatively influenced by the growth of the shares of individuals of the species s adopting the n t strategy ɛ 0 that is only the most ecologically motivated l i individuals are sensitive to the change in behaviour of the s species let us assume that the process of adoption of h i l i n t and t strategies is described by the well known replicator equations 5 x x 1 x π h i x y π l i x y 6 y y 1 y π n t x y π t x y where x and y represents the time derivatives of the functions x t and y t respectively and 7 π h i x y π l i x y α γ β δ x ɛ y 8 π n t x y π t x y f e d a x b e 2 f y f c y 2 measure the payoff difference between strategies h i and l i eq 7 and between strategies n t and t eq 8 the dynamical system 5 6 is based on social learning see greggor et al 2019 gruber et al 2019 if the payoff of strategy h i is higher than that of strategy l i i e π h i x y π l i x y 0 then the share x of humans adopting it increases i e x 0 the opposite holds when strategy l i performs better than h i similarly if the payoff of strategy n t is higher than that of strategy t i e π n t x y π t x y 0 then the share y of individuals adopting it increases i e y 0 the opposite holds when strategy t performs better than n t obviously the relative performance of strategies depends on the distribution x y of strategies in the two interacting populations for simplicity we rename parameters as follows γ α γ φ β δ ω ϵ a f c b d a c b e 2 f d f c so the payoff differences 7 and 8 become 9 π h i x y π l i x y γ φ x ω y 10 π n t x y π t x y a b x c y d y 2 where ω b 0 according to our assumptions while the remaining parameters may be either positive or negative parameters ω and b play a key role in our analysis parameter b measures the relative advantage of the n t strategy compared to t as the share x of humans adopting the high impact h i strategy increases the higher the value of b the higher is the relative advantage of animals adopting n t with respect to those adopting t the parameter ω measures the relative advantage of the high impact strategy h i compared to the l i strategy as the y share of individuals adopting the n t strategy increases in principle the payoffs of the h i and l i strategies might not depend on the distribution of the t and n t strategies in the animal population however in some cases this is not the case and individuals adopting the l i strategy are more vulnerable than those adopting the h i strategy to a spread of the n t strategy in the animal population consider for example the case where the h i strategy consists in hunting roe deer with the use of dogs while the l i strategy consists in hunting them without the use of dogs as a reaction to the use of dogs by hunters roe deer can adopt a strategy the n t strategy of the model which consists for example in choosing habitats that are less and less accessible to hunters without dogs so an increase in the share y of animals adopting the n t strategy increases the relative performance of the h i strategy with respect to the one of the l i strategy another simple example could be the following suppose h i is the underwater fishing strategy while l i strategy consists of fishing with the rod from the coast as spearfishing spreads the fish move away from the coast i e adopt the n t strategy and the more the fishing is done underwater the more the fish will move away from the coast generating an increase in the relative performance of strategy h i with respect to the one of the l i strategy finally consider the example where l i humans go to the countryside to see photograph animals while h i humans go hunting t animals have shorter escape distance i e they let humans approach them while n t animals have longer escape distance as soon as they sense the presence of humans they run away without letting humans approach them in this context it is reasonable to expect that l i humans are more affected by the increase in n t animals because they cannot photograph animals closely taking into account of these examples we assume that ω 0 holds that is the relative performance of humans adopting h i of strategy li increases as the share of animals adopting the non typical n t behaviour increases another parameter that plays a key role is the d parameter about which we have not made any hypothesis on sign it multiplies y 2 and therefore measures a congestion effect which becomes more and more relevant as y increases while it is negligible for y near to 0 by d we have indicated the difference between f the parameter that measures the congestion effect generated by the spread of the t strategy and c the parameter that measures the congestion effect generated by the spread of the n t strategy so the sign of d can be either positive or negative to fix ideas suppose that a population of seagulls can choose between the t strategy catch fish at sea and the n t strategy eat food in a landfill or move to the city a congestion effect may occur as seagulls tend to specialize in one of the two strategies but the two effects are not necessarily the same for example it could happen that the eating in landfill strategy is more affected by the congestion effect than the fishing at sea strategy note that in eq 10 for relatively low values of y the effect on payoff difference due to the value of the term c y prevails over the effect due to the quadratic term d y 2 in such a context if c 0 then an increase in y ceteris paribus increases the relative payoff of the n t strategy and thus the growth of y is self reinforcing vice versa if c 0 finally the parameter γ respectively a measures the difference between payoffs of strategies h i and l i respectively n t and t when x y 0 that is when all humans adopt strategy l i and all animals adopt strategy t even with regard to these two parameters we made no assumptions about their sign 3 dynamic regimes the dynamical system 5 6 is defined in the square q q x y 0 x 1 0 y 1 each point x y of the square q represents a specific distribution of the four strategies within the two populations considered the vertices of the square x y 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 are the states where each of the two populations specializes by adopting only one of the two possible behaviours for example in 0 0 we have that no human adopts the high impact strategy h i and no animal adopts the non typical n t behaviour while in 1 1 exactly the opposite happens such states are always equilibrium points of the dynamical system 5 6 this means that if the state x y coincides at the initial time t 0 with one of the four states listed above then both x and y will remain constantly equal to their respective initial values in each successive instant of time t 0 this property is due to the fact that the considered dynamical system is based on learning processes through which strategies that show a higher relative performance are imitated at the expense of the other ones in the states 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 only one type of behaviour is observed within each of the two populations and therefore the learning process is not activated according to the system 5 6 x 0 holds for x 0 x 1 and along the straight line 11 y γ ω φ ω x furthermore it holds x 0 above 11 and x 0 below it i e strategy h i performs better than strategy l i for high enough values of y analogously y 0 holds for y 0 y 1 and along the curve a parabola if d 0 12 x a b c b y d b y 2 by the assumption b 0 y 0 holds to the right of 12 while y 0 holds to the left i e strategy n t performs better than strategy t for high enough values of x other than the vertices 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 of q the equilibrium points of system 5 6 are 1 the intersection points when they exist between the line 11 and the sides of q with either y 0 or y 1 2 the intersection points when they exist between the curve 12 and the sides of q with either x 0 or x 1 3 the points when they exist internal to the square q and lying at the intersection between the line 11 and the curve 12 notice that at most two internal equilibrium points exist in such states all the available strategies coexist the stability analysis of equilibrium points is developed in the mathematical appendix according to proposition 1 in the appendix at most one internal equilibrium point can be attractive furthermore an attractive internal equilibrium point can exist only if φ 0 that is if the h i strategy becomes relatively less profitable than the l i strategy as it spreads through the human population see eq 9 the internal equilibrium e 1 the one with the higher share y of animals playing the n t strategy can be attractive only if d 0 that is if the spread of the n t strategy in the animal population generates a congestion effect that is higher than the congestion effect generated by the spread of the t strategy the internal equilibrium e 2 can be attractive in the opposite case d 0 a complete classification of all dynamic regimes that can be observed as parameter values change would be overly tedious so we focus our analysis to some numerical simulations fig 1 shows a dynamic regime generated by the parameter values given in the caption of such figure in which there exist several equilibrium points represented by full dots empty dots and empty squares however only two of these are locally attractive those represented by full dots and are therefore reachable by the trajectories of the dynamical system 5 6 one of these is internal to the square q and so all the strategies coexist in it no one of the two populations specializes in a single strategy that is heterogeneity of behaviours is observed the set of initial values of x and y from which trajectories converge to such an equilibrium point the basin of attraction of it is coloured red the second attractive equilibrium point 1 1 lies on the upper side of the square q its basin of attraction is coloured grey at such a state x 1 and y 1 hold that is all humans adopt the high impact strategy h i and all individuals of the species s adopt the non typical n t behaviour the dynamic regime showed in fig 1 is an example of path dependence the equilibrium point that will be achieved depends on the initial values of x and y that is on the initial distribution of behaviours in the two interacting populations if the initial shares x and y are high low enough then the dynamical system converges to the equilibrium point 1 1 respectively to the internal equilibrium point fig 2 a d show how the basins of attraction of the internal equilibrium point and of 1 1 vary as the parameter b varies in the context illustrated in fig 1 remember that b measures the relative advantage of the n t strategy with respect to t as the x share of humans adopting the h i strategy increases the higher the value of b the more the animals adopting the n t behaviour are favoured with respect to those adopting t and consequently n t tends to be adopted by an increasing number of individuals observe that as b increases the basin of attraction of the equilibrium 1 1 expands at the expenses of that of the internal equilibrium in fig 2 d 1 1 is the unique attractive equilibrium and therefore both populations always specialize in strategies h i and n t fig 3 illustrates another dynamic regime that may be observed under the replicator dynamics 5 6 notice that in such a context coexistence between strategies cannot be observed the unique attractive equilibrium points are 0 0 where only strategies l i and t are adopted and 1 1 where only strategies h i and n t are adopted the basin of attraction of 1 1 is in grey while that of 0 0 is in blue in such a dynamic regime a polarization of behaviour is observed and the coexistence of strategies cannot occur fig 4 a c show how the basins of attraction of 0 0 and 1 1 vary as the parameter b varies in the context illustrated in fig 3 observe that as b increases the basin of attraction of the equilibrium 1 1 expands at the expenses of that of the equilibrium 0 0 fig 5 illustrates a coexistence scenario there exist two attractive equilibrium points in the internal one all the strategies coexist in that lying in the lower side of the square q strategies h i and l i coexist in the population of humans while all individuals of the species s specialize in the typical t behaviour fig 6 illustrates a dynamic regime with four attractive equilibrium points with basins of attraction coloured in blue pink yellow and green depending on the initial distributions of the four strategies the dynamical system may converge to each of the four attractive equilibrium points figs 7 and 8 show the attractive equilibrium points that exist in correspondence of each pair of values of parameters b and ω in the yellow region of fig 7 a the symbols defined in the mathematical appendix only e x 0 is attractive in the light blue region only e x 0 and e 1 1 are attractive and in the blue region only e 1 and e x 0 are attractive figs 7 b and 8 a b can be interpreted similarly notice that fig 8 a b refers to the context φ 0 in which internal equilibrium points e 1 and e 2 cannot be attractive see proposition 1 in the appendix finally in figs 9 and 10 the colorbars indicate the values of x panels a and y panels b at the attractive internal equilibrium points e 1 and e 2 respectively notice that ceteris paribus the equilibrium value of the share y of animals adopting n t increases as the value of the parameter b increases 4 comments and concluding remarks in recent years great attention has been paid to the countless species on the verge of extinction as well as the potential for biodiversity loss human action either directly e g excessive hunting or fishing or indirectly e g habitat destruction puts these animals at risk however another effect due to human activity that appears to be equally essential is the loss of species specific behaviour indeed as a result of increased production and pollution many species have changed their behaviour and survival tactics members of animal species may have alternative behaviours strategies at their disposal strategies that they would typically adopt in the absence of human interferences e g hunting preys and alternative strategies that they would typically adopt in the presence of human interferences e g looking for food left over in woods country side or landfills the latter type of strategies can be viewed either as self protection devices allowing animal species to defend from the negative consequences of human action pollution habitat destruction extinction of natural preys etc or as opportunistic behaviours it may be easier to find food in rubbish dumps than in natural habitats while the natural strategies would be widely used in the absence of human activities the alternative strategies may become better performing when people are around to the best of our knowledge our paper represents the first work in the literature proposing an evolutionary model for examining how human action can change the typicality of animal species behaviour it examines a bio economic model that takes the species typicality into account formalized by assuming that members of the species have two alternative strategies at their disposal a typical strategy t and a non typical strategy n t similarly each member of the population of humans has two strategies at their disposal one strategy that generates a high environmental impact h i and one that generates a low environmental impact l i the analysis of this evolutionary game has shown that even in a very simple ecological context rich dynamic scenarios can emerge characterized by multiple attractive equilibrium points and therefore by path dependence the initial distribution of strategies determines the equilibrium point that will be achieved in the model two basic mechanisms are at work in conditioning the adoption process of strategies the first is a self reinforcing mechanism the diffusion of h i and n t strategies tends to increase the payoffs of these strategies relatively to those of the alternative strategies l i and t this mechanism can bring the ecological dynamics to the equilibrium of complete specialization x y 1 1 where the only strategies adopted are h i and n t the second mechanism concerns the congestion effect which increases as one of the two strategies t and n t spreads in the animal population this effect favours the existence of attractive equilibrium points where both t and n t strategies are adopted by a fraction of the animal population the interplay between these two mechanisms may generate the simultaneous presence of a coexistence equilibrium where all strategies coexist and a specialization equilibrium where the two populations specialize by adopting only one of the two possible strategies see e g figs 1 and 2 however in some cases the self reinforcing mechanism prevails and a polarization of behaviours is observed see e g figs 3 and 4 in such a case the only attractive equilibrium points are x y 0 0 where only strategies l i and t are adopted and x y 1 1 where only strategies h i and n t are adopted we are aware that the analytical results obtained depend on the assumptions made about the payoff functions however while a comprehensive examination of more possible formalizations would be fascinating it would be beyond the scope of this paper and should be left to future research in fact the purpose of the work is to propose a new research line and to highlight a policy issue that has been largely ignored thus far how to link the battle against biodiversity loss with the fight against species behavioural typicality loss both dimensions in our opinion must be considered in order to appropriately address the effects of human action this appears to be especially crucial if we wish to avoid unintended and undesirable changes in natural dynamics as well as the emergence of a fake natural system in which preserved animals lose their instincts and adopt unusual and possibly controlled behaviour subsequent developments in this research can follow three different directions 1 the first is the development of an optimal economic growth model where in addition to the equation describing the process of physical capital accumulation a replicator equation is introduced that describes the process of adoption of t and n t strategies by individuals of an animal species it is basically a matter of merging the aggregate approach followed by antoci et al 2021 where the adjustment of the share of adoption of the n t strategy took place instantaneously with the evolutionary approach followed in this paper where this adjustment takes place gradually in that it is driven by a learning process 2 the current model focused on the percentage of individuals adopting the n t strategy and does not give information on the total number of individuals belonging to the animal population considered in fact it is likely that the share of adoption of n t strategy is constrained by the carrying capacity of the ecosystem and can affect the vulnerability of this population to negative impacts deriving from human action therefore a further development could be an evolutionary model where in addition to the variables x and y considered in the model a third variable n is introduced that measures the number of individuals of the species in such a more complex model the carrying capacity n y should be considered as a function of the share y of individuals adopting the n t strategy and a similar assumption should be made to model the impact generated by humans adopting h i which should be considered as a function of y 3 the third way of developing the present framework is to build models of human animal interaction with two or more animal species each of which can choose between two or more strategies clearly this approach gives rise to complex models that are likely to generate very complex dynamics credit authorship contribution statement angelo antoci conceptualization methodology formal analysis writing original draft marco

as f φ x ω y γ 0 g a b x c y d y 2 0 the slopes of the tangent lines to the curves f and g at the point e i x i y i i 1 2 are respectively s f φ ω and s g b c 2 d y i now we prove the claim a of the proposition see fig 11 a if both the equilibrium points e 1 x 1 y 1 and e 2 x 2 y 2 lie on the rising branch of the curve g that is s f 0 and s g 0 see left panel of fig 11 a then φ 0 and c 2 d y i 0 hold b 0 and ω 0 by assumption so it is easy to check that at the equilibrium point e 1 t r j x i 1 x i φ y i 1 y i c 2 d y i 0 holds furthermore the inequality s f s g i e φ c 2 d y i b ω 0 is satisfied and therefore s i g n d e t j s i g n φ c 2 d y i b ω 0 this implies that the equilibrium point e 1 is a locally attractive point in the equilibrium point e 2 it holds s f s g and therefore s i g n d e t j 0 this implies that the equilibrium point e 2 is a saddle point in the case where the point e 2 lies in the decreasing branch of g see right panel in fig 11 a being s g 0 and s g s f it holds s i g n d e t j 0 this implies that the equilibrium point e 2 is a saddle point the statements b c and d of proposition 1 can be proved in a similar way 
24261,taking into account of a rapidly growing literature studying the negative effects of changes in animal behaviour induced by human activities on ecological dynamics biodiversity preservation and human well being we model the interaction between a population of humans and a population of animals by means of an evolutionary game in such a game we assume that humans can adopt two alternative behaviours strategies one with a high environmental impact h i and the other with a low impact l i animals also have two alternative behaviours they can behave in a typical t or non typical n t way the former corresponds to the natural strategy animals would typically adopt in the absence of human interference e g hunting prey while the latter can be seen as an adaptive behaviour adopted by animals to defend themselves from the negative consequences of human action or to opportunistically benefit of food resources that human activity may provide as a by product the analysis of our model shows that the adoption process of the strategies h i l i n t t can generate a great variety of dynamic regimes even if the ecological context we consider is very simple the main purpose of this work is to propose a new research line in ecological modelling and to highlight a policy issue that has been largely ignored thus far how to link the battle against biodiversity loss with the fight against species behavioural typicality loss keywords animal behaviour anthropogenic environmental changes typical behaviour evolutionary game data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction the mathematical models that analyse the impact of human activities on ecological dynamics see among many others antoci et al 2005 vasilieva 2015 focus on the analysis of their impact on the number of individuals of each species and on the coevolution of populations of different species interacting with each other these models do not explicitly take into account possible changes in animal behaviour induced by human activities and their consequences for ecological dynamics biodiversity and human well being although a rapidly growing literature is addressing these issues a classic example is that of the seagulls species who find today large quantities of anthropogenic foods in landfills and this often induce them to move toward big cities or their surrounding areas where landfills can be more easily found see e g auman et al 2011 parra torres et al 2020 carmona et al 2021 schell et al 2021 spelt et al 2021 graells et al 2022 sotillo et al 2022 however ecological literature illustrate several other examples some works focus on large carnivores gray wolves coyotes bears etc in that they are widely distributed their predatory behaviour strongly affects ecosystems and many of them live in close proximity to humans see among the others newsome et al 2017 ellington and gehrt 2019 petroelje et al 2019 zeller et al 2019 ciucci et al 2020 another example is the development of nocturnal crop foraging behaviour in communities of chimpanzees see krief et al 2014 mclennan et al 2017 gruber et al 2019 to avoid interaction with humans martınez abraın et al 2019 provide numerous examples showing the increase in the frequency of fearless behaviours in populations of mammals and birds in southern european countries due to relaxed persecution toward wildlife combined with the large scale abandonment of rural livelihoods during the last 3 4 decades plummer et al 2019 study the effects of feeding wild birds in urban areas of britain streicker and allgeier 2016 analyse the effects on foraging behaviour and rabies transmission by vampire bats due to the proliferation of livestock togera et al 2018 study the availability and distribution of food resources in urban areas as driver of wild boar movement patterns other examples can be found in oro et al 2013 and in the literature cited therein such behavioural adaptation processes can have serious consequences for ecological systems and can be considered as an index of environmental degradation 1 1 heavy reliance by apex predators on anthropogenic food subsidies is an indicator of ecosystem degradation newsome et al 2017 in fact they may have negative impacts on human well being in two ways the first concerns the direct damage due to the increased human animal interaction road accidents caused by crossing wildlife see e g sàenz de santa maría and tellerá 2015 in air accidents caused by flocks of birds see e g thorpe 2016 transmission of diseases see e g tompkins et al 2011 etc the second concerns the benefit to humans deriving from the observation of animal species in their natural habitats there is no doubt that it is better to observe a seagull fishing in the sea than to observe one eating in an urban waste dump or a bear moving in the woods than a bear feeding on food provided by tourists changes in the behaviour of individuals of animal species can also be induced by human activities aimed at protecting them for example cortés avizanda et al 2016 highlight the negative effects on the ecological balance due to the introduction of supplementary feeding stations vulture restaurants aimed at avoiding the extinction of large avian scavengers this paper aims to model the change in animal behaviour induced by human activity and the feedback effects that this change may have on human activity it provides an example of the classical approach of evolutionary games in the spirit of the seminal book evolution and the theory of games published by john maynard smith at 40 years from its publication in 1982 the context analysed is extremely simple in particular we only consider two interacting populations one of humans and one of animals as we will see in the next section the two populations play an evolutionary game in particular we assume that humans can adopt two alternative behaviours strategies one with a high environmental impact h i and the other with a low impact l i animals also may adopt two alternative behaviours they can behave in a typical t or non typical n t way the former corresponds to the natural strategy animals would typically adopt in the absence of human interference e g hunting prey while the latter can be seen as an adaptive behaviour adopted by animals to defend themselves from the negative consequences of human action pollution habitat destruction extinction of natural prey etc or to opportunistically benefit of resources that human activity may provide as a by product food shelters nesting sites etc in the model we assume that the relative performance of the n t behaviour compared to the t one increases as the share of humans adopting h i increases the analysis of our model shows that the coevolution of the strategies adopted by the two types of players humans and animals can generate a wide variety of equilibrium states in some of these the two populations specialize by adopting only one of the two possible strategies for example only h i and n t are adopted in the populations of humans and animals respectively while in others the coexistence of all available strategies can be observed to the best of our knowledge the first model that takes into account the effect of human behaviour on the typicality of animal behaviour is the work of antoci et al 2021 where an optimal economic growth model is proposed in which a social planner maximizes the utility of economic agents by taking into account the effects of their choices on the typicality of animal behaviour in such work the level of typicality of animal behaviour is measured by an index of typicality x which depends negatively on the amount of goods produced and consumed by economic agents and positively on the defensive expenditures implemented by the social planner in order to induce animals to behave typically in this context antoci et al 2021 show that there cannot exist an optimal trajectory along which the accumulated physical capital and the quantities of goods produced and consumed grow indefinitely in fact such a trajectory would imply a well being loss for humans resulting from the reduction in typicality of behaviour of animals that would not be compensated for by the growth in the quantity of goods produced and consumed in this paper we approach the study of the spread of non typical behaviour by animals through a disaggregated approach that is unlike in antoci et al 2021 we explicitly model the process of adoption of non typical behaviour by animals in response to human choices as indicated in the conclusions of this paper one of the possible further research step could be to integrate the two different approaches by introducing an equation modelling the process of adoption of alternative strategies by animals into an optimal economic growth model the following is a breakdown of the article s structure section 2 presents the set up of the model section 3 focuses on the equilibrium points of ecological dynamics and performs numerical simulations section 4 provides conclusions and appendix mathematical appendix contains the stability analysis of the equilibrium points 2 set up of the model let us consider a population game all humans and animals interact together with two populations one of animals belonging to a species s and one of humans each human has two available strategies a low environmental impact strategy l i to produce and consume low quantities of goods to adopt non polluting technologies to hunt without dogs etc and a high environmental impact strategy h i to produce and consume high quantities of goods to adopt polluting technologies to hunt with dogs etc individuals of species s can adopt two alternative behaviours strategies t and n t the t strategy represents typical behaviour such a behaviour performs better than the alternative one n t when a sufficiently high proportion of humans adopt the low impact l i strategy in the opposite case the n t strategy becomes more rewarding for the s species in other words individuals adopting n t behaviour are less vulnerable than those adopting t to the spread of the high impact strategy h i in the population of humans so the n t strategy can be interpreted as an adaptive behaviour adopted by individuals to defend themselves against the negative impact generated by the humans high impact strategy h i t and n t strategies can also be interpreted as choices of alternative places mountain vs valley forest vs city etc where to live to complete the description of the basic hypotheses that characterize the model let us also assume that humans at least those adopting the low impact l i strategy prefer s individuals adopting t to s individuals adopting n t for example they prefer seagulls fishing for sardines at sea to those eating in landfills we indicate with the variable x t the share of humans adopting the h i strategy at time t 0 and with the variable y t the share of individuals of the species s adopting the n t strategy at time t therefore 1 x t 0 and 1 y t 0 so 1 x t and 1 y x represent respectively the share of humans adopting the l i strategy and the share of animals adopting the t strategy let us assume that the payoffs of t and n t which can be interpreted as a fitness measure of t and n t are respectively expressed by the functions 1 π n t x y a x b y c y 2 2 π t x y d x e 1 y f 1 y 2 where b c d e f are strictly positive parameters while a is a parameter that may assume both positive and negative values seagulls that eat in landfills benefit from the arrival of more waste the negative effects due to congestion are modelled by the squared terms f 1 y 2 and c y 2 which may prevail over the positive effects represented by the terms e 1 y and b y when the shares 1 y and y are sufficiently high according to such a modelling choice the payoffs of n t and t strategies initially increase as their respective adoption shares increase and then possibly starts to decrease let assume a d this hypothesis models the lower vulnerability of n t adopters to the impact generated by humans adopting h i similarly let us assume that the payoffs of the h i and l i strategies are respectively expressed by the functions 3 π h i x y α β x 4 π l i x y γ δ x ɛ y where α γ ɛ 0 while the parameters β and δ may be both positive and negative they represent the effects of the spread of the h i strategy on the payoffs of humans adopting h i and l i respectively for simplicity we have assumed that only the payoff of humans adopting the low impact l i strategy is negatively influenced by the growth of the shares of individuals of the species s adopting the n t strategy ɛ 0 that is only the most ecologically motivated l i individuals are sensitive to the change in behaviour of the s species let us assume that the process of adoption of h i l i n t and t strategies is described by the well known replicator equations 5 x x 1 x π h i x y π l i x y 6 y y 1 y π n t x y π t x y where x and y represents the time derivatives of the functions x t and y t respectively and 7 π h i x y π l i x y α γ β δ x ɛ y 8 π n t x y π t x y f e d a x b e 2 f y f c y 2 measure the payoff difference between strategies h i and l i eq 7 and between strategies n t and t eq 8 the dynamical system 5 6 is based on social learning see greggor et al 2019 gruber et al 2019 if the payoff of strategy h i is higher than that of strategy l i i e π h i x y π l i x y 0 then the share x of humans adopting it increases i e x 0 the opposite holds when strategy l i performs better than h i similarly if the payoff of strategy n t is higher than that of strategy t i e π n t x y π t x y 0 then the share y of individuals adopting it increases i e y 0 the opposite holds when strategy t performs better than n t obviously the relative performance of strategies depends on the distribution x y of strategies in the two interacting populations for simplicity we rename parameters as follows γ α γ φ β δ ω ϵ a f c b d a c b e 2 f d f c so the payoff differences 7 and 8 become 9 π h i x y π l i x y γ φ x ω y 10 π n t x y π t x y a b x c y d y 2 where ω b 0 according to our assumptions while the remaining parameters may be either positive or negative parameters ω and b play a key role in our analysis parameter b measures the relative advantage of the n t strategy compared to t as the share x of humans adopting the high impact h i strategy increases the higher the value of b the higher is the relative advantage of animals adopting n t with respect to those adopting t the parameter ω measures the relative advantage of the high impact strategy h i compared to the l i strategy as the y share of individuals adopting the n t strategy increases in principle the payoffs of the h i and l i strategies might not depend on the distribution of the t and n t strategies in the animal population however in some cases this is not the case and individuals adopting the l i strategy are more vulnerable than those adopting the h i strategy to a spread of the n t strategy in the animal population consider for example the case where the h i strategy consists in hunting roe deer with the use of dogs while the l i strategy consists in hunting them without the use of dogs as a reaction to the use of dogs by hunters roe deer can adopt a strategy the n t strategy of the model which consists for example in choosing habitats that are less and less accessible to hunters without dogs so an increase in the share y of animals adopting the n t strategy increases the relative performance of the h i strategy with respect to the one of the l i strategy another simple example could be the following suppose h i is the underwater fishing strategy while l i strategy consists of fishing with the rod from the coast as spearfishing spreads the fish move away from the coast i e adopt the n t strategy and the more the fishing is done underwater the more the fish will move away from the coast generating an increase in the relative performance of strategy h i with respect to the one of the l i strategy finally consider the example where l i humans go to the countryside to see photograph animals while h i humans go hunting t animals have shorter escape distance i e they let humans approach them while n t animals have longer escape distance as soon as they sense the presence of humans they run away without letting humans approach them in this context it is reasonable to expect that l i humans are more affected by the increase in n t animals because they cannot photograph animals closely taking into account of these examples we assume that ω 0 holds that is the relative performance of humans adopting h i of strategy li increases as the share of animals adopting the non typical n t behaviour increases another parameter that plays a key role is the d parameter about which we have not made any hypothesis on sign it multiplies y 2 and therefore measures a congestion effect which becomes more and more relevant as y increases while it is negligible for y near to 0 by d we have indicated the difference between f the parameter that measures the congestion effect generated by the spread of the t strategy and c the parameter that measures the congestion effect generated by the spread of the n t strategy so the sign of d can be either positive or negative to fix ideas suppose that a population of seagulls can choose between the t strategy catch fish at sea and the n t strategy eat food in a landfill or move to the city a congestion effect may occur as seagulls tend to specialize in one of the two strategies but the two effects are not necessarily the same for example it could happen that the eating in landfill strategy is more affected by the congestion effect than the fishing at sea strategy note that in eq 10 for relatively low values of y the effect on payoff difference due to the value of the term c y prevails over the effect due to the quadratic term d y 2 in such a context if c 0 then an increase in y ceteris paribus increases the relative payoff of the n t strategy and thus the growth of y is self reinforcing vice versa if c 0 finally the parameter γ respectively a measures the difference between payoffs of strategies h i and l i respectively n t and t when x y 0 that is when all humans adopt strategy l i and all animals adopt strategy t even with regard to these two parameters we made no assumptions about their sign 3 dynamic regimes the dynamical system 5 6 is defined in the square q q x y 0 x 1 0 y 1 each point x y of the square q represents a specific distribution of the four strategies within the two populations considered the vertices of the square x y 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 are the states where each of the two populations specializes by adopting only one of the two possible behaviours for example in 0 0 we have that no human adopts the high impact strategy h i and no animal adopts the non typical n t behaviour while in 1 1 exactly the opposite happens such states are always equilibrium points of the dynamical system 5 6 this means that if the state x y coincides at the initial time t 0 with one of the four states listed above then both x and y will remain constantly equal to their respective initial values in each successive instant of time t 0 this property is due to the fact that the considered dynamical system is based on learning processes through which strategies that show a higher relative performance are imitated at the expense of the other ones in the states 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 only one type of behaviour is observed within each of the two populations and therefore the learning process is not activated according to the system 5 6 x 0 holds for x 0 x 1 and along the straight line 11 y γ ω φ ω x furthermore it holds x 0 above 11 and x 0 below it i e strategy h i performs better than strategy l i for high enough values of y analogously y 0 holds for y 0 y 1 and along the curve a parabola if d 0 12 x a b c b y d b y 2 by the assumption b 0 y 0 holds to the right of 12 while y 0 holds to the left i e strategy n t performs better than strategy t for high enough values of x other than the vertices 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 of q the equilibrium points of system 5 6 are 1 the intersection points when they exist between the line 11 and the sides of q with either y 0 or y 1 2 the intersection points when they exist between the curve 12 and the sides of q with either x 0 or x 1 3 the points when they exist internal to the square q and lying at the intersection between the line 11 and the curve 12 notice that at most two internal equilibrium points exist in such states all the available strategies coexist the stability analysis of equilibrium points is developed in the mathematical appendix according to proposition 1 in the appendix at most one internal equilibrium point can be attractive furthermore an attractive internal equilibrium point can exist only if φ 0 that is if the h i strategy becomes relatively less profitable than the l i strategy as it spreads through the human population see eq 9 the internal equilibrium e 1 the one with the higher share y of animals playing the n t strategy can be attractive only if d 0 that is if the spread of the n t strategy in the animal population generates a congestion effect that is higher than the congestion effect generated by the spread of the t strategy the internal equilibrium e 2 can be attractive in the opposite case d 0 a complete classification of all dynamic regimes that can be observed as parameter values change would be overly tedious so we focus our analysis to some numerical simulations fig 1 shows a dynamic regime generated by the parameter values given in the caption of such figure in which there exist several equilibrium points represented by full dots empty dots and empty squares however only two of these are locally attractive those represented by full dots and are therefore reachable by the trajectories of the dynamical system 5 6 one of these is internal to the square q and so all the strategies coexist in it no one of the two populations specializes in a single strategy that is heterogeneity of behaviours is observed the set of initial values of x and y from which trajectories converge to such an equilibrium point the basin of attraction of it is coloured red the second attractive equilibrium point 1 1 lies on the upper side of the square q its basin of attraction is coloured grey at such a state x 1 and y 1 hold that is all humans adopt the high impact strategy h i and all individuals of the species s adopt the non typical n t behaviour the dynamic regime showed in fig 1 is an example of path dependence the equilibrium point that will be achieved depends on the initial values of x and y that is on the initial distribution of behaviours in the two interacting populations if the initial shares x and y are high low enough then the dynamical system converges to the equilibrium point 1 1 respectively to the internal equilibrium point fig 2 a d show how the basins of attraction of the internal equilibrium point and of 1 1 vary as the parameter b varies in the context illustrated in fig 1 remember that b measures the relative advantage of the n t strategy with respect to t as the x share of humans adopting the h i strategy increases the higher the value of b the more the animals adopting the n t behaviour are favoured with respect to those adopting t and consequently n t tends to be adopted by an increasing number of individuals observe that as b increases the basin of attraction of the equilibrium 1 1 expands at the expenses of that of the internal equilibrium in fig 2 d 1 1 is the unique attractive equilibrium and therefore both populations always specialize in strategies h i and n t fig 3 illustrates another dynamic regime that may be observed under the replicator dynamics 5 6 notice that in such a context coexistence between strategies cannot be observed the unique attractive equilibrium points are 0 0 where only strategies l i and t are adopted and 1 1 where only strategies h i and n t are adopted the basin of attraction of 1 1 is in grey while that of 0 0 is in blue in such a dynamic regime a polarization of behaviour is observed and the coexistence of strategies cannot occur fig 4 a c show how the basins of attraction of 0 0 and 1 1 vary as the parameter b varies in the context illustrated in fig 3 observe that as b increases the basin of attraction of the equilibrium 1 1 expands at the expenses of that of the equilibrium 0 0 fig 5 illustrates a coexistence scenario there exist two attractive equilibrium points in the internal one all the strategies coexist in that lying in the lower side of the square q strategies h i and l i coexist in the population of humans while all individuals of the species s specialize in the typical t behaviour fig 6 illustrates a dynamic regime with four attractive equilibrium points with basins of attraction coloured in blue pink yellow and green depending on the initial distributions of the four strategies the dynamical system may converge to each of the four attractive equilibrium points figs 7 and 8 show the attractive equilibrium points that exist in correspondence of each pair of values of parameters b and ω in the yellow region of fig 7 a the symbols defined in the mathematical appendix only e x 0 is attractive in the light blue region only e x 0 and e 1 1 are attractive and in the blue region only e 1 and e x 0 are attractive figs 7 b and 8 a b can be interpreted similarly notice that fig 8 a b refers to the context φ 0 in which internal equilibrium points e 1 and e 2 cannot be attractive see proposition 1 in the appendix finally in figs 9 and 10 the colorbars indicate the values of x panels a and y panels b at the attractive internal equilibrium points e 1 and e 2 respectively notice that ceteris paribus the equilibrium value of the share y of animals adopting n t increases as the value of the parameter b increases 4 comments and concluding remarks in recent years great attention has been paid to the countless species on the verge of extinction as well as the potential for biodiversity loss human action either directly e g excessive hunting or fishing or indirectly e g habitat destruction puts these animals at risk however another effect due to human activity that appears to be equally essential is the loss of species specific behaviour indeed as a result of increased production and pollution many species have changed their behaviour and survival tactics members of animal species may have alternative behaviours strategies at their disposal strategies that they would typically adopt in the absence of human interferences e g hunting preys and alternative strategies that they would typically adopt in the presence of human interferences e g looking for food left over in woods country side or landfills the latter type of strategies can be viewed either as self protection devices allowing animal species to defend from the negative consequences of human action pollution habitat destruction extinction of natural preys etc or as opportunistic behaviours it may be easier to find food in rubbish dumps than in natural habitats while the natural strategies would be widely used in the absence of human activities the alternative strategies may become better performing when people are around to the best of our knowledge our paper represents the first work in the literature proposing an evolutionary model for examining how human action can change the typicality of animal species behaviour it examines a bio economic model that takes the species typicality into account formalized by assuming that members of the species have two alternative strategies at their disposal a typical strategy t and a non typical strategy n t similarly each member of the population of humans has two strategies at their disposal one strategy that generates a high environmental impact h i and one that generates a low environmental impact l i the analysis of this evolutionary game has shown that even in a very simple ecological context rich dynamic scenarios can emerge characterized by multiple attractive equilibrium points and therefore by path dependence the initial distribution of strategies determines the equilibrium point that will be achieved in the model two basic mechanisms are at work in conditioning the adoption process of strategies the first is a self reinforcing mechanism the diffusion of h i and n t strategies tends to increase the payoffs of these strategies relatively to those of the alternative strategies l i and t this mechanism can bring the ecological dynamics to the equilibrium of complete specialization x y 1 1 where the only strategies adopted are h i and n t the second mechanism concerns the congestion effect which increases as one of the two strategies t and n t spreads in the animal population this effect favours the existence of attractive equilibrium points where both t and n t strategies are adopted by a fraction of the animal population the interplay between these two mechanisms may generate the simultaneous presence of a coexistence equilibrium where all strategies coexist and a specialization equilibrium where the two populations specialize by adopting only one of the two possible strategies see e g figs 1 and 2 however in some cases the self reinforcing mechanism prevails and a polarization of behaviours is observed see e g figs 3 and 4 in such a case the only attractive equilibrium points are x y 0 0 where only strategies l i and t are adopted and x y 1 1 where only strategies h i and n t are adopted we are aware that the analytical results obtained depend on the assumptions made about the payoff functions however while a comprehensive examination of more possible formalizations would be fascinating it would be beyond the scope of this paper and should be left to future research in fact the purpose of the work is to propose a new research line and to highlight a policy issue that has been largely ignored thus far how to link the battle against biodiversity loss with the fight against species behavioural typicality loss both dimensions in our opinion must be considered in order to appropriately address the effects of human action this appears to be especially crucial if we wish to avoid unintended and undesirable changes in natural dynamics as well as the emergence of a fake natural system in which preserved animals lose their instincts and adopt unusual and possibly controlled behaviour subsequent developments in this research can follow three different directions 1 the first is the development of an optimal economic growth model where in addition to the equation describing the process of physical capital accumulation a replicator equation is introduced that describes the process of adoption of t and n t strategies by individuals of an animal species it is basically a matter of merging the aggregate approach followed by antoci et al 2021 where the adjustment of the share of adoption of the n t strategy took place instantaneously with the evolutionary approach followed in this paper where this adjustment takes place gradually in that it is driven by a learning process 2 the current model focused on the percentage of individuals adopting the n t strategy and does not give information on the total number of individuals belonging to the animal population considered in fact it is likely that the share of adoption of n t strategy is constrained by the carrying capacity of the ecosystem and can affect the vulnerability of this population to negative impacts deriving from human action therefore a further development could be an evolutionary model where in addition to the variables x and y considered in the model a third variable n is introduced that measures the number of individuals of the species in such a more complex model the carrying capacity n y should be considered as a function of the share y of individuals adopting the n t strategy and a similar assumption should be made to model the impact generated by humans adopting h i which should be considered as a function of y 3 the third way of developing the present framework is to build models of human animal interaction with two or more animal species each of which can choose between two or more strategies clearly this approach gives rise to complex models that are likely to generate very complex dynamics credit authorship contribution statement angelo antoci conceptualization methodology formal analysis writing original draft marco

hold b 0 and ω 0 by assumption so it is easy to check that at the equilibrium point e 1 t r j x i 1 x i φ y i 1 y i c 2 d y i 0 holds furthermore the inequality s f s g i e φ c 2 d y i b ω 0 is

s i g n d e t j 0 this implies that the equilibrium point e 2 is a saddle point in the case where the point e 2 lies in the decreasing branch of g see right panel in fig 11 a being s g 0 and s g s f it holds s i g n d e t j 0 this implies that the equilibrium point e 2 is a saddle point the statements b c and d of proposition 1 can be proved in a similar way 
24262,arctic rabies is an ongoing threat to human populations and domestic animals inpolar regions where arctic foxes vulpes lagopus are the main reservoir hosts human driven changes in resource availability are shifting the distribution of arctic foxes and these changes may affect the risk of rabies transmission and spread our understanding of the effects of broad scale movement strategies in arctic foxes and spatial distribution of resources on contact patterns among arctic foxes and their consequences on the dynamics of rabies epidemiology remains limited in part due to the difficulty of obtaining contact data from such remote and expansive regions in this perspective we built a spatially explicit agent based model coupled with hidden markov models to explore how arctic fox movement behavior combined with arctic fox population density resource availability and rabies transmission dynamics affects the risk of infectious contact between arctic foxes across heterogeneous landscapes the model was parameterized using a combination of unique field data collected in the canadian high arctic and published studies from other arctic regions a sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the effects of multiple model input parameters on contact rates among arctic foxes our results showed that cumulative contact rates per fox were driven by predictors related to rabies transmission dynamics and fox carrying capacity while unique contact rates per fox and unique infectious contact rates per rabid fox were best predicted by parameters associated with rabies transmission dynamics fox movement behavior and fox carrying capacity ultimately our study provides new insights into the ecological drivers of rabies transmission and may inspire further research on modelling cost effective rabies prevention strategies in the arctic keywords arctic rabies vulpes lagopus spatially explicit agent based model animal movement contact rate hidden markov model data availability data and code will be made available on request 1 introduction heterogeneity in the rate at which infectious individuals come into contact and transmit pathogens to susceptible individuals plays a key role in infectious disease dynamics wilson et al 2002 some hosts can contribute disproportionately to pathogen spread which can lead to super spreading events lloyd smith et al 2005 woolhouse et al 1997 proposed the 20 80 rule whereby 20 of the most infectious hosts in a given population are responsible for at least 80 of pathogen transmission because heterogeneity in pathogen transmission has major implications for disease management and prevention vanderwaal and ezenwa 2016 it is important to identify the mechanisms inducing individual variation in the probability of transmitting pathogens given contact differences in physiology and behavior among hosts can contribute to such variation in pathogen acquisition vanderwaal and ezenwa 2016 host behavior is an important component for directly transmitted diseases i e those requiring contact between a susceptible and an infectious individual in particular when space use patterns affect the contact risk among potential hosts johnson and hoverman 2014 vanderwaal and ezenwa 2016 while social interactions can induce large variation in contact rates between individuals and create situations that facilitate pathogen transmission in the landscape altizer et al 2003 movement patterns can also influence the number of contacts between individuals movement behavior can be characterized at different temporal and spatial scales benhamou 2014 at coarse temporal resolutions animal movement is often categorized into four strategies migration dispersal nomadism and sedentarism sensu bastille rousseau et al 2016 while at finer temporal scales movement can be classified as behavioral states e g resting searching foraging fryxell et al 2008 changes in movement behavior are driven by trade offs between the costs of moving e g energy loss risk of mortality and the benefits of resource acquisition bonte et al 2012 and these changes can affect infectious disease dynamics in wildlife while the interest of understanding the causes and ecosystem level consequences of broad scale animal movement strategies has led to the development of multiple modeling approaches reviewed in joo et al 2020 few studies have explored the effects of different broad scale host movement strategies on zoonotic pathogen transmission e g migration vs sedentarism pruvot et al 2016 rayl et al 2021 there are thus opportunities to use movement based behavioral analyses to explore pathogen transmission risk among individuals dougherty et al 2018 rabies is one of the most widespread zoonotic diseases that threaten human and animal health fooks et al 2014 this virus is responsible for approximately 59 000 human deaths worldwide and 8 6 billion us dollars in economic losses per year hampson et al 2015 several distinct strains of rabies virus circulate in multiple species of wild mammals baer 1991 warrell and warrell 2004 the arctic strain of rabies is observed throughout arctic and sub arctic regions where the virus remains enzootic in wildlife crandell 1991 thus posing a significant threat to public health mediouni et al 2020 a person can contract rabies following a bite by a rabid wild animal or a domestic dog that became infected as a result of contact with a rabid wild animal mørk and prestrud 2004 the arctic fox vulpes lagopus is regarded as the primary reservoir host for arctic rabies mørk and prestrud 2004 simon et al 2020 arctic foxes are both opportunistic predators and scavengers of a wide variety of prey and have a circumpolar distribution that spans inland and coastal habitats varying in rodent availability which induces differences in feeding strategies angerbjörn et al 2004 arctic foxes relying on rodents such as lemmings are highly dependent on cyclical rodent population pulses occurring every three to five years bêty et al 2002 consequently these lemming foxes can have large litters up to 19 cubs but show high variation in breeding success tannerfeldt and angerbjörn 1998 in contrast arctic foxes living in coastal habitats where cyclic rodents are absent like svalbard iceland and west greenland have access to relatively stable and predictable food resources among years and their diet is diversified consisting of many marine food items that are largely available in summer but limited in winter e g carcasses of marine mammals and seabirds crustaceans and fishes berteaux et al 2017 hersteinsson and macdonald 1996 prestrud 1992 consequently these foxes produce fewer cubs per litter and their reproduction patterns are more stable compared to lemming foxes tannerfeldt and angerbjörn 1998 resource availability also has a large influence on movement behavior of arctic foxes it has been suggested that lemming foxes may travel longer distances than coastal ones in response to food shortages angerbjörn et al 2004 in this context changes in arctic fox movement behavior could affect the risk of contact between individuals with implications for rabies virus transmission several rabies models often involving raccoons red foxes skunks and bats have been used to investigate the influence of host density host behavior including movement and habitat selection and landscape features i e landscape composition and configuration on rabies transmission and spread dynamics or contact risk brunker et al 2018 sararat et al 2022 smith et al 2002 tardy et al 2018 and to test rabies control strategies mcclure et al 2022 2020 newton et al 2019 however we lack an understanding of how arctic fox movement behavior affects arctic rabies transmission dynamics partly due to the difficulty of obtaining contact data from remote and expansive areas of arctic and sub arctic regions in addition the majority of existing arctic rabies models do not explicitly incorporate mechanistic links between arctic fox movement and landscape heterogeneity moran et al 2021 2022 simon et al 2019 which can lead to less accurate predictions of transmission events fofana and hurford 2017 we built a spatially explicit agent based model abm coupled with hidden markov models to explore how broad scale arctic fox movement strategies in concert with arctic fox population density spatial distribution of resources and rabies transmission dynamics affect the risk of virus transmission among arctic foxes across spatially heterogeneous landscapes the objective of this study was addressed in two steps first we identified different broad scale arctic fox movement strategies using multi year argos satellite data then we quantified the relative influence of multiple abm input parameters and explored their relationships with different metrics of contact rates through a global sensitivity analysis using the abm we simulated arctic fox populations varying in broad scale movement strategies and individual densities across theoretical landscapes that differed in spatial aggregation of resources 2 materials and methods 2 1 characterization of broad scale movement strategies we identified broad scale movement strategies in 41 satellite tracked arctic foxes using net squared displacement nsd statistics with a discrete latent state model a type of hidden markov model bastille rousseau et al 2016 see the subsection model parameterization for more details on telemetry data the approach combining nsd statistics and a latent state model consisted in calculating nsd values from argos derived locations for each individual and fitting the frequency distribution of the nsd values with a latent state model based on a mixture of two normal distributions and one pseudo uniform distribution bastille rousseau et al 2016 the nsd is calculated as the square of the euclidean distance between the first location of an individual and each subsequent location of its movement path bunnefeld et al 2011 turchin 1998 a latent state model defines three movement modes based on the frequency distribution of the nsd values two encamped modes 1 and 2 that correspond to different foraging areas where movements are slow and meandering and one exploratory mode 3 that is equivalent to a transitional movement mode allowing for fast and directed movements between these areas bastille rousseau et al 2016 the modes 1 and 2 are characterized by a normal distribution of the nsd values while the mode 3 is defined by a pseudo uniform distribution of the nsd values bastille rousseau et al 2016 the latent state model takes into consideration the temporal autocorrelation present in nsd time series and satisfies the markov property according to which the behavioral state at a given time depends on the state at the previous time which makes it possible to investigate the probabilities of switching between movement modes see bastille rousseau et al 2016 for the full expression of the likelihood of the latent state model the criteria used to differentiate movement strategies are based on a 3 3 matrix representing the probability of being in movement mode j at time t 1 given that the individual was in mode i at time t q i j for i j 1 2 3 and the number of transitions between each mode see bastille rousseau et al 2016 for further details a bayesian modeling framework based on markov chain monte carlomethods is used for estimating parameters bastille rousseau et al 2016 for each fox we ran a model using three markov chains and 5000 iterations when the model did not converge we reran the model by increasing the number of iterations up to 250 000 iterations the model was validated by visually comparing the nsd time series to those in bunnefeld et al 2011 double sigmoid function migration sigmoid function dispersal linear function nomadism and horizontal asymptotic function sedentarism see also fig 1 in bastille rousseau et al 2016 finally we tested how the characterization of movement strategies was sensitive to the starting date of the nsd time series using a clustering technique see bastille rousseau et al 2016 for more details we varied the start date over the first 70 days of locations by taking 10 windows of locations of 7 days and we ran the models with 25 000 iterations the analysis of movement strategies using nsd statistics with a latent state model was performed with the lsmnsd package version 0 0 0 9000 bastille rousseau et al 2016 in the r statistical software version 3 6 1 r development core team 2019 2 2 model overview in this section we provide a detailed abm description following the overview design concepts and details odd protocol grimm et al 2006 2010 2020 the model was implemented in r using the netlogor package version 0 3 7 bauduin et al 2019 2 2 1 purpose and patterns the abm is designed to simulate broad scale movement strategies of arctic foxes from hidden markov models hmms that were parameterized with telemetry location data and in which we incorporated covariates using this modeling framework in an epidemiological context the purpose of the abm is to identify the primary drivers of the risk of rabies transmission between arctic foxes among host specific movement and carrying capacity environmental resource availability and epidemiological predictors and to explore their relationships across spatially heterogeneous landscapes given that rabies transmission events are broadly dependent on mechanisms modulating contact rates we explored cumulative and unique contact patterns among simulated arctic foxes emerging from the mechanistic movement process implemented in the abm the integration of a rabies transmission process in the abm provides the possibility of evaluating the risk of rabies transmission between arctic foxes through the analysis of unique infectious contact rates per rabid individual 2 2 2 entities state variables and scales the abm integrates two layers representing the landscape and simulated arctic foxes two types of entities are thus included in the model landscape cells and arctic foxes that are modelled as mobile individuals occupying the cells state variables associated with each entity are either static fixed during a given simulation or dynamic updated at each time step and are listed in table 1 as experiments involving a range of large landscapes with controlled spatial distribution of resources are often difficult to carry out and replicate we generated a set of theoretical landscapes varying in spatial aggregation clustering of resources from mean zero and variance one gaussian random fields grfs with an exponential covariance function fig b 1 in appendix b similarly to forester et al 2009 we assumed that there is no nugget effect grfs have been used in several studies to model the spatial dependence of ecological processes such as animal movement e g aarts et al 2013 bracis et al 2015 dupont et al 2021 our theoretical landscapes consisted of a grid of 700 rows 700 columns cells with a cell resolution of 1 km which represents an area of 490 000 km² the scale parameter ϕ g that controls the level of autocorrelation between the grid cells varied from 10 to 250 ϕ g 10 25 50 150 and 250 high values of ϕ g generate landscapes composed of highly aggregated resources while at low values of ϕ g resources are randomly distributed in the landscape to improve the visual interpretation of the resulting resource gradient the grf values were scaled between 0 and 1 using a linear stretch method johnson et al 2004 that takes the form g x w x w min w max w min the term w x represents the grf values at each location x x y in the landscape and w min and w max correspond to the smallest and highest grf values respectively the values of g can be interpreted as estimating the probability that the spatial location is in a resource rich area tardy et al 2021 for each landscape we identified hotspots as areas of high resource availability where the values of g were above a threshold value h t g which varied from 0 6 to 0 8 high values of h t g reduce the number of hotspots in the landscape the center of each hotspot was defined as the location with the highest value of g lai et al 2015 the abm runs at discrete time steps of one hour 2 2 3 process overview and scheduling the arctic fox layer depends on the landscape layer based on two ecological processes that are described in the subsection submodels 1 arctic fox movement and 2 rabies transmission the abm evolves in a cell based setting bian 2003 in which the ecological processes act at the cell scale consequently the context dependencies i e conspecific density and resource availability operating in the movement process act at this scale fox individuals that are present in a given cell define a distinct open population i e experiencing recruitment through immigrations or losses through deaths and emigrations for simplicity we assumed that the populations of simulated arctic foxes were geographically closed i e no death immigration or emigration from outside the landscape all simulations were performed over a total period of 5000 h 208 days which corresponds to the sea ice period october 25 may 31 at each time step each simulated arctic fox can move to another cell according to movement rules that are defined from hmms once individual locations are updated rabies transmission success is evaluated between a susceptible fox and an infectious fox fig 1 the simulation ends when the maximum number of steps is reached i e 5000 steps to avoid having simulated arctic foxes moving all the time within the landscape 2 2 4 design concepts the current version of the abm does not include collectives basic principles given the ability of arctic foxes to detect food resources on sea ice lai et al 2015 the abm integrates a foraging movement process that involves two phases emigration from the den and transfer towards a hotspot in which context dependencies operate at the cell scale the foraging trip during the transfer phase is modelled using hmms that segment movement trajectories into different behavioral states based on time series of step lengths and turning angles langrock et al 2012 zucchini et al 2017 most input parameters of the simulated hmms were estimated from satellite tracked arctic fox location data associated with four movement strategies i e migration dispersal nomadism and sedentarism see the subsection characterization of broad scale movement strategies in the section results the hmms were used to calculate state switching probabilities as a function of covariates which allows modulating behavioral decisions of arctic foxes in response to environmental conditions the abm thus differs from other arctic rabies models moran et al 2021 2022 simon et al 2019 in that our model explicitly describes arctic fox movement behavior and its interaction with the environment emergence the simulated movement patterns associated with the four strategies i e migration dispersal nomadism and sedentarism are affected by landscape characteristics combined with stochasticity in the movement process this leads to the emergence of heterogeneous spatial distribution patterns among simulated arctic foxes giving rise to spatial heterogeneity in contact rates between individuals adaptation during the emigration phase simulated arctic foxes decide to leave their natal cell or den based on the number of conspecifics within the cell the probability of emigrating from the natal cell increases with increasing conspecific abundance when an arctic fox emigrates the individual enters the transfer phase and moves to a landscape cell determined by the hidden markov state process the latter is simulated at each time step from an estimated state transition probability matrix the probabilities of transitioning from one state to another depend on three covariates distance from the current location to a hotspot the time since departure from the den or natal cell and resource availability see the subsection submodels for more details on the movement process objectives simulated arctic foxes move towards foraging areas within the landscape based on the sequences of foraging trips observed in satellite tracked arctic foxes the movement trajectories of simulated foxes reflect a fitness seeking behavior with a larger amount of time spent in foraging rather than resource searching behavior see the subsection state sequences of foraging trips in the section results individuals can be constrained to forage in close proximity or away from their natal cell or den depending upon the hotspot locations learning simulated arctic foxes change their behavior over time as a function of their previous experiences these changes were modelled through simulated hmms in which the behavioral state process has a markov property such that the future state depends on the current state with the aim of predicting future movement fitted hmms that were used to parameterize the simulated hmms were applied in an unsupervised learning context to infer behavioral states from movement data in an unsupervised learning context behavioral state classification is based on step length and turning angle distributions and is not validated by direct observations of behaviors prediction in the simulated hmms of the abm the behavioral state process that is characterized by a transition probability matrix predicts the future state of simulated arctic foxes given their current state the choice of the next cell thus relies on the previous experience with the objective for foxes to reach a hotspot or return to their den after a certain period of time more information on the behavioral state process is given in the subsection submodels sensing simulated arctic foxes have knowledge of conspecific density and habitat quality in their natal cell individuals move according to what they perceive in the landscape and can detect the presence of hotspots within their perceptual range interaction intraspecific competition for resources is implicitly modelled in the abm density dependence in the emigration process operates at the cell scale where the presence of conspecifics is used as a cue for habitat quality individuals are more likely to leave their natal cell or den when conspecific density is high in the cell stochasticity the theoretical landscapes are generated from grfs which gives rise to stochasticity in the spatial distribution of resources some abm input parameters are drawn from probability distributions table 2 stochasticity is also introduced into the abm through the arctic fox movement and rabies transmission processes where the occurrence of an emigration or transmission event is determined by a bernoulli trial finally the hmms used in the arctic fox movement process are stochastic models where each behavioral state is defined by a random walk see the subsection submodels for more details on the simulated hmms observation all dynamic state variables of each simulated arctic fox are saved at the end of each time step in particular the location of the current cell the health state and the success of rabies transmission are used to calculate the number of cumulative and unique contacts for each arctic fox as well as the number of unique infectious contacts for each rabid individual within a given cell at each time step the average number of different contacts is saved after each simulation given that contacts can be distributed in different ways among individuals tardy et al 2018 e g five contacts for a given individual can be distributed as either five contacts with one conspecific or one contact with five different conspecifics we calculated the average number of cumulative contacts per arctic fox i e the average number of conspecifics that have been in direct contact with a simulated fox and the average number of unique contacts per arctic fox i e the average number of different conspecifics that have been in direct contact with a simulated fox we also computed the average number of unique infectious contacts per rabid arctic fox i e the average number of different conspecifics that have been exposed to rabies following a direct contact with a simulated infectious fox these metrics provide different information about contact events cumulative contact rates influence the probability of transmitting or contracting pathogens whereas unique contact rates inform on the risk of super spreading events tardy et al 2018 a direct contact between two simulated arctic foxes occurred when both foxes were present in the same cell at a given time finally we calculated the proportion of time spent in each behavioral state characterizing the simulated foraging trip of each migrating dispersing nomadic or sedentary arctic fox using the viberti algorithm see the subsection model parameterization for more details the average proportion of time spent in each state is saved after each simulation 2 2 5 initialization uninfected foxes are randomly distributed in the landscape cells with a number of individuals equal to k at least 100 cells apart from study area boundaries to avoid edge effects we modelled rabies transmission dynamics by allowing a proportion of infectious foxes η r to transmit the virus to their conspecifics infectious foxes displayed either a dumb or furious behavior see the subsection submodels for more details on the rabies transmission process the landscape cells in which each fox is located at the initial time are defined as natal cells or dens a hotspot was randomly assigned to each migrating and dispersing arctic fox the abm does not use input data to represent time varying processes 2 2 6 submodels in the abm we integrated two submodels corresponding to two ecological processes arctic fox movement and rabies transmission arctic fox movement each arctic fox has a probability of leaving its natal cell or den at a given time step t and this probability depends on the presence of conspecifics in the cell the emigration probability p e is given by the following function introduced by kun and scheuring 2006 p e d m a x e 1 e n i t k i b e a e where n i t represents the number of simulated arctic foxes in cell i at time t k i corresponds to the carrying capacity of foxes in cell i and d m a x e is the maximum emigration probability the parameters b e and a e define the inflection point of the density dependent emigration function and the slope at the inflection point of the function respectively a bernoulli trial determines if the arctic fox emigrates or not from its natal cell when the simulated fox does not emigrate from its natal cell i e when b e r n p e 0 the fox stays in its natal cell and assumes a resting state in the case where the fox emigrates from its natal cell i e when b e r n p e 1 we simulated fox movement from hmms whose most input parameters were estimated by fitting hmms to argos derived locations of arctic foxes having movement patterns indicative of four movement strategies i e migration dispersal nomadism and sedentarism table 2 full details on the telemetry location data can be found in the subsection model parameterization we assumed that the trajectories of migrating foxes consisted of four behavioral states sensu michelot et al 2017 1 outbound state o where movement is fast and highly directed from a den or natal cell to a resource rich area or hotspot 2 search state s where movement is moderately fast with some directional persistence near the hotspot 3 forage state f where movement is slow and non directed within the hotspot and 4 inbound state or return i where movement is fast and highly directed from the hotspot to the den fig 2 for arctic foxes displaying a dispersal strategy we considered three states to distinguish outbound search and forage behaviors without a return trip towards the den fig 2 finally we assumed that foxes in nomadic and sedentary movement strategies alternated between search and forage states and these strategies differed in terms of step lengths and turning angles with more concentrated movements around the den for the sedentary behavior fig 2 the arctic fox movement in the search and forage states was modelled using correlated random walks crws where turning angles were drawn from a von mises distribution with mean λ and concentration κ large κ values imply low variance of the von mises distribution and consequently high directional persistence we modelled the fox movement in the outbound and inbound states using biased random walks brws with attraction towards either the hotspot in the outbound state or the den in the inbound state by assuming that turning angles followed a von mises distribution with mean ϕ t and concentration κ where ϕ t arctan y p y t x p x t is the direction of the vector pointing from the current location x t y t to a focal point x p y p i e the hotspot or den for each state we used a gamma distribution to draw step lengths we used a non observable hidden state process s t o s f i to describe state switching dynamics the state process is governed by a first order markov chain and when combined with the observation process in which the behavioral states are modelled by the types of random walks conditional on the current state defines a hidden markov model zucchini et al 2017 for arctic fox movement assuming that the occurrence of a future state at time t 1 depends on the current state at time t the state process s t was characterized by transition probabilities as follows γ γ oo γ os 0 0 0 γ ss γ sf γ si 0 γ fs γ ff 0 0 0 0 γ ii where γ ij pr s t 1 j s t i for i j o s f i the probabilities that are non zero allow the process to switch from one state to another state we prevented some transitions by setting probabilities to zero the matrix γ was adjusted according to each movement strategy e g the matrix γ considered above corresponds to the migration strategy the transition probabilities were expressed as a function of three covariates i distance from the current location to a hotspot at time t d t to model the fact that migrating or dispersing foxes make fast and directed movements away from their den and tend to switch into other movement states once they reach a hotspot ii the time since departure from the den t t 0 to model the return towards the den and iii resource availability g in the landscape to integrate another key aspect of foraging behavior whereby individuals tend to switch from a searching state to a foraging state with increasing resource availability with tortuous and shorter movements in resource rich areas compared to resource poor areas the covariate d t influenced the probability of switching from the outbound state to the search state γ o s as follows γ os e η os 1 e η os where η os β 0 os β d t os d t the covariate t t 0 affected the probability of switching from the search state to the inbound state γ s i as there are several non zero probabilities from the search state i e γ s f and γ s i the transition probability γ s i depended on the covariate t t 0 through a multinomial logit link as follows γ si e η si 1 e η sf e η si where η si β 0 si β t t 0 si t t 0 the values of g that were considered fixed over time influenced the probabilities of switching from the search state to the forage state γ s f and from the forage state to the search state γ f s as follows γ sf e η sf 1 e η sf e η si and γ fs e η fs 1 e η fs where η sf β 0 sf β g sf g and η fs β 0 fs β g fs g the parameters β 0 o s β d t o s β 0 s i and β t t 0 s i as well as the parameters for the step length and turning angle distributions were estimated from the argos derived location data see the subsection model parameterization for further details on the fitted hmms for example this results in eight parameters for the gamma distributed steps and six parameters for the von mises distributed angles to estimate in the observation process of the four state hmms associated with the migration strategy table 2 the mean parameters of turning angles for the outbound and inbound states were fixed to a large positive number i e 100 to define the bias towards the hotspot or den mcclintock and michelot 2018 due to constraints of environmental data availability the range of possible values for the input parameters associated with the transition probabilities depending on the value of g i e β 0 s f β g s f β 0 f s and β g f s was chosen via a simple trial and error calibration procedure because precision was not necessary to evaluate the effects of movement strategies on contact rates among simulated arctic foxes the remaining elements of the transition probability matrix were obtained so that the rows of the matrix sum to one and thus varied with time the fitted hmm parameters were converted into hourly values to parameterize the simulated hmms of the abm a simulated foraging trip started in the outbound state for the migration and dispersal type movement strategies and in the search state for the nomadism and sedentarism type strategies at each time step the state process was simulated from the estimated transition probabilities and a turning angle and a step length were then simulated from the estimated von mises and gamma distributions respectively rabies transmission rabies transmission events are evaluated at each time step virus transmission which requires direct contact could occur between simulated arctic foxes when a susceptible fox i e unexposed to rabies and an infectious fox shared the same cell during the same time step the probability that a susceptible fox becomes infected i e exposed to the virus but not yet infectious was defined by p r t 1 1 ρ c ε i i t where i i t represents the number of infectious foxes in the same cell i at time t ρ c corresponds to the rabies transmission probability and ε defines the probability of encountering conspecifics a bernoulli trial determines the success of rabies transmission we varied the rabies transmission probability ρ c according to behavioral changes from rabies infection i e furious when the animal is dominated by aggressive behavior or dumb when the animal is characterized by increased paralysis mørk and prestrud 2004 the rabies transmission probability between a susceptible fox and a rabid fox increased when rabid foxes displayed aggressive behavior whereas the transmission probability decreased when rabid foxes had dumb behavior in the abm exposed arctic foxes became infectious after an incubation period υ given that high virulence of rabies contributes to very low levels of natural immunity blancou et al 2009 and serological surveys of arctic fox populations are rare but see ballard et al 2001 for an example we supposed that rabies was 100 lethal after an infectious period γ similarly to moran et al 2021 the incubation and infectious periods were simulated from an erlang distribution i e gamma distribution with an integer shape parameter krylova and earn 2013 2 3 model parameterization the abm input parameters associated with arctic fox carrying capacity and rabies transmission were defined from empirical and modeling studies on the arctic fox and rabies virus most input parameters related to the arctic fox movement process were estimated by fitting hmms to satellite tracked arctic fox location data in total 41 adult arctic foxes were initially captured on bylot island nunavut canada from 2009 to 2014 and were tracked with argos satellite collars that were programmed to transmit daily locations during one year raw satellite data were filtered and one location per day per individual was kept based on the smallest location error details on the capture procedure and telemetry data including duty cycles and filtering are given in lai et al 2017 we estimated missing daily locations 9 31 of total locations using continuous time correlated random walk models as described in johnson et al 2008 to reduce uncertainty inherent to movement data for our analyses we selected movement records that encompassed one complete winter season corresponding to the sea ice period october 25 may 31 table a 1 in appendix a the sea ice period is of particular interest to explore various movement behaviors of arctic foxes tarroux et al 2010 before performing the fitting of hmms we removed highly stationary location data based on one dimensional time series plots of the locations given that these data give little information and can increase numerical instability michelot et al 2017 for the process of fitting hmms to the telemetry location data a cluster analysis was performed using migrating and dispersing arctic fox locations to identify hotspot centroids we used the tadpole clustering algorithm implemented in the dtwclust package version 5 5 10 sardá espinosa 2019 in r and based on 10 clusters a cutoff distance of 1500 m and a window size of 1 day each cluster was visualized for all individuals and we selected one cluster for each individual to reflect the location of key activity centers hmm goodness of fit was evaluated for each movement strategy i e migration dispersal nomadism and sedentarism by checking the normality and temporal independence of pseudo residuals for step lengths and turning angles for simplicity and as explaining individual variation in transition probabilities was not our central goal we modelled the behavioral states of all individuals combined without considering individual level random effects in the hmms mcclintock 2021 the hmm fitting to the telemetry data was performed with the momentuhmm package version 1 5 1 mcclintock and michelot 2018 in r in this package the viterbi algorithm is used to determine the most likely sequence of behavioral states zucchini et al 2017 and the hmm parameters are estimated by likelihood maximization using a recursive algorithm called the forward algorithm zucchini et al 2017 which requires the specification of good starting values for step lengths and turning angles following the recommendations of michelot et al 2016 we fitted hmms with several sets of starting values n 50 that were generated from a uniform distribution and we selected the best fitting hmm with the largest likelihood 2 4 sensitivity analysis we performed a global sensitivity analysis sa to evaluate the sensitivity of arctic fox contact patterns to variations in abm input parameters a total of 14 input parameters were included in the sa table 2 level of autocorrelation between the landscape grid

probability of rabies transmission among arctic foxes having the dumb form of the virus ρ d weight for the probability of rabies transmission among arctic foxes having the furious form of the virus ω a and probability of encountering conspecifics ε we used a latin hypercube sampling scheme to sample 150 different parameter combinations from a uniform probability distribution satisfying the minimum value of 4 n 3 where n is the number of input parameters mckay et al 1979 because our abm included stochasticity in the spatial distribution of resources due to the stochastic algorithm of grfs we generated 10 replicated landscapes for each parameter combination resulting in a total of 1500 simulations similarly to our previous papers tardy et al 2021 2022 we built boosted regression tree brt models elith et al 2008 to assess the relative contribution of each input parameter in predicting abm output variables and to identify which of the parameters had the highest effect on these output variables we used the average number of cumulative contacts per arctic fox the average number of unique contacts per arctic fox and the average number of unique infectious contacts per rabid arctic fox as output variables a gaussian error structure was used for the loss function of the brt models the contact rates were log transformed in the brt models to achieve variance homogeneity and to obtain gaussian error distributions we tested several combinations of learning rate 0 01 0 005 0 001 tree complexity 1 5 and bag fraction 0 5 0 7 0 9 to determine optimal settings for the brt models we selected the parameter combination with the lowest 10 fold cross validation deviance to fit the final brt model we also evaluated the relative contribution of the input parameters based on their effect on the ecological processes that are implemented in the abm the input parameters belonged to four categories landscape carrying capacity of arctic foxes arctic fox movement and rabies transmission table 2 we visualized the relationships between the output variables and the most influential input parameters with partial dependence plots in which 95 confidence intervals were obtained from 500 bootstrap replicates we tested the significance of the strongest interactions using 100 bootstrap resampling iterations pinsky and byler 2015 the brt models were built from the dismo version 1 1 4 and ggbrt version 0 0 0 9000 packages in r hijmans et al 2020 jouffray et al 2019 3 results 3 1 broad scale movement strategies the analysis of the nsd time series of arctic foxes n 41 using nsd statistics with a latent state model showed inter individual variations in coarse scale movement strategies we found that 66 n 27 of arctic foxes were sedentary individuals with probabilities of switching from one movement mode to another of q 22 0 90 and q 33 0 90 the results also revealed that 12 n 5 of foxes had patterns of transition between the modes similar to nomadic strategy q 11 0 95 q 22 0 90 and q 33 0 85 and 12 n 5 of foxes displayed dispersal behavior q 11 0 95 q 22 0 95 and q 33 0 85 finally 10 n 4 of foxes showed migration behavior with transition probabilities of q 11 0 95 q 22 0 95 and q 33 0 85 together with the presence of transition back from the second encamped mode the classification of large scale movement strategies in arctic foxes was not sensitive to variation in the starting date of the nsd time series on average overall agreement for the classification of strategies was 91 range 72 100 at the daily level we found that 82 of monitoring days had 80 agreement range 28 100 among the iterations and 65 of days had 95 agreement range 9 100 3 2 state sequences of foraging trips given the fitted hmms for each movement strategy the analysis of pseudo residuals for the step lengths and turning angles showed that the pseudo residuals were approximately normally distributed fig c 1 c 4 in appendix c there was some autocorrelation in the pseudo residuals in particular for the step lengths from the 2 state hmm fitted to the argos tracking data of sedentary arctic foxes fig c 1 c 4 in appendix c which can suggest the need for adding more states or covariates however model complexity can make biological interpretation of states difficult and lead to unstable parameter estimation pohle et al 2017 our choice of the number of states was based on the results of the analysis of the nsd time series using nsd statistics with a latent state model as well as the ecology of arctic foxes and the constraints of available environmental data the fitted hmms revealed that sedentary arctic foxes spent 79 of their time foraging range 44 100 and 23 of their time searching for resource rich foraging areas range 1 56 nomadic arctic foxes were in the foraging state 80 of their time range 70 91 and in the searching state 20 of their time range 9 30 we found that migrating foxes allocated 39 of their time to foraging behavior range 5 59 25 of their time searching for resource rich foraging areas range 20 33 21 of their time to the inbound trip from the foraging area or hotspot to the den range 10 45 and 15 of their time to the outbound trip from the den to the foraging area range 5 30 dispersing foxes were in the outbound trip 41 of their time range 3 77 in the foraging state 40 of their time range 14 83 and in the searching state 19 of their time range 2 39 in addition the fitted hmms showed that the transition probabilities from outbound to search states for arctic foxes displaying migration and dispersal behaviors decreased with increasing distance to the hotspot migrating and dispersing arctic foxes tended to perform searching activities for resource rich areas when they were located at less than 400 km from these areas fig 3 a and b finally we observed that the transition probabilities from search to inbound states for arctic foxes having migration behavior increased when the time since departure from the den was high migrating foxes tended to start returning to their den after about 60 days fig 3 c these patterns were reproduced by the abm 3 3 contact rates among arctic foxes the brt models performed well for quantifying the relative contribution of each abm input parameter on contact rates among arctic foxes with 10 fold cross validation deviance explained ranging from 82 to 99 and with cross validated correlation ranging from 0 91 to 0 99 table d 1 in appendix d in the sections below we describe the relationships between contact rates among arctic foxes and the most influential input parameters 10

predictors a significant difference in unique contact rates was found between migration and dispersal strategies with higher unique contact rates per individual observed among dispersing arctic foxes fig 5 a two sided pairwise wilcoxon rank sum test with bonferroni correction w 35 811 and p 0 0001 there were also significant differences in unique contact rates between these two strategies and those associated with nomadism and sedentarism type movements fig 5 a two sided pairwise wilcoxon rank sum test with bonferroni correction w 98 641 and p 0 0001 for migration vs nomadism w 96 195 and

and animal health mørk and prestrud 2004 despite a growing body of literature covering the ecology of arctic foxes important knowledge gaps exist regarding the ecology of the arctic rabies virus which includes the influence of host behavior on rabies transmission events simon et al 2020 in particular the ecological processes modulating contact rates among arctic foxes are often speculative limiting our understanding of the consequences of environmental changes on rabies dynamics in the arctic we built the first spatially explicit agent based model for arctic fox rabies in which hmms were used to mechanistically simulate broad scale movement strategies migration dispersal nomadism and sedentarism in arctic foxes our results showed that rabies transmission dynamics and fox carrying capacity were key predictors of cumulative contact rates among arctic foxes while rabies transmission dynamics fox movement behavior and fox carrying capacity determined unique contact rates 4 1 contact patterns in arctic fox populations we found differences between cumulative and unique contact rates our results revealed that low prevalence of rabies among arctic foxes 0 0 2 and increased carrying capacities of arctic foxes 0 07 0 1 foxes km² resulted in high cumulative contact rates between arctic foxes with an increase in fox home range overlap tending to occur in areas where resources were clustered and scarce hotspots with resource availability values 0 78 in our study low prevalence of rabies allows maintaining arctic fox populations at high density levels preventing their extinction field studies showed that prevalence of rabies was low among arctic foxes 0 3 3 suggesting that the virus is not endemic in local arctic fox populations but is occasionally introduced by foxes migrating on sea ice prestrud et al 1992 from the abm simulations cumulative contact rates increased nonlinearly with arctic fox density and tended to saturate at higher individual densities indicating that rabies transmission among arctic foxes should be intermediate between density and frequency dependent transmission smith et al 2009 the nonlinear nature of the relationship between contact rates and individual density results from changes in state switching movement dynamics with resource availability our results showed a higher relative influence of the landscape on the number of cumulative contacts per fox compared to the number of unique contacts per fox landscape heterogeneity can produce scarce hotspots of resources and resource scarcity can lead to higher arctic fox densities around scavenged carcasses and thus create opportunities for pathogen transmission by close contact simon et al 2020 for example arctic foxes can congregate in large numbers in resource rich areas during extraterritorial foraging of adults in winter december february which can increase contact rates between individuals lai et al 2015 in addition our results revealed that low prevalence of rabies among arctic foxes 0 0 2 dispersal type movement strategy and increased carrying capacities of arctic foxes 0 07 0 1 foxes km² induced high unique contact rates between arctic foxes using the abm simulations we observed that unique contact rates increased among dispersing arctic foxes when they allocated 50 of their time to the outbound trip suggesting areas at highest risk for unique contacts between dispersing arctic foxes are those not too far away from dens the outbound trip which is characterized by fast and highly directed movements occurs when a fox leaves its den to search for new resources it then follows a transitional phase of searching activity where movement is moderately fast with some directional persistence near resource rich areas between the outbound state and the foraging state where movement is slow and non directed within resource rich areas dispersing arctic foxes investing more time in searching and foraging activities 50 of their time were more likely to have contact with different conspecifics this pattern was also observed for arctic foxes displaying a migration type movement strategy the second at risk strategy these foxes exhibited higher unique contact rates when they spent 40 of their time in the outbound state from the fitted hmms migrating and dispersing arctic foxes tended to engage in searching activities for resource rich areas when they were located less than 400 km from these areas despite a large number of studies showing the important role of animal migration in long distance spread of pathogens fritzsche mckay and hoye 2016 risely et al 2018 satterfield et al 2018 the demonstration of the impact of dispersal behavior on pathogen transmission remains limited boulinier et al 2016 our results suggest that the dispersal type movement strategy has the potential to act as a super spreading process as this strategy is likely to increase the number of unique contacts with other conspecifics compared to migration nomadism and sedentarism behaviors as observed for migrating host individuals teitelbaum et al 2018 it is expected that dispersing host individuals that visit multiple sites across a broad geographic range would be more likely to be exposed to a high number and diversity of pathogens owing to increased contacts with other host individuals shaw et al 2018 arctic foxes can move over long distances outside their home range lai et al 2017 tarroux et al 2010 for example an arctic fox travelled 4 415 km in four months between svalbard norway and ellesmere island canada fuglei and tarroux 2019 however our simulation results suggest that a dispersal strategy over such long distances is not the most critical for arctic rabies transmission it has been shown that reduced long distance movements of hosts could favor pathogen transmission by increasing host exposure to contaminated habitats where pathogens have accumulated in the environment over time hall et al 2014 finally we found that low prevalence of rabies among arctic foxes 0 0 2 increased carrying capacities of arctic foxes 0 07 0 1 foxes km² high infectious periods 4 7 days and long distance movement strategies i e migration and dispersal led to high unique infectious contact rates from rabid arctic foxes long infectious periods are required to favor infectious contacts and thus to maintain rabies even in populations at high arctic fox densities generally the infectious period of rabies varies between one and seven days and arctic foxes can die between one and three days after the onset of symptoms konovalov et al 1965 no significant difference in unique infectious contact patterns among arctic foxes was found between migration and dispersal strategies but these two strategies produced higher unique infectious contact rates compared to nomadism and sedentarism type movement strategies the trend observed in the unique infectious contact patterns among migrating and dispersing arctic foxes was similar to that found in the unique contact patterns with migrating and dispersing arctic foxes displaying higher unique infectious contact rates when they spent 40 and 50 of their time in the outbound trip respectively rather than in the other states unique infectious contact rates were amplified among dispersing arctic foxes when they invested more time in foraging activities 50 of their time while for migrating arctic foxes the chance to become infected after contact with a rabid conspecific increased when they allocated more time in both foraging and inbound trips 40 of their time to model the return to the den the state sequence alternates first with the foraging and searching trips and finally is forced to remain in the inbound trip until the end of a given simulation migrating arctic foxes increased their time spent in the inbound trip when they moved across several foraging areas and tended to cross previously visited areas in order to return to their den this can produce contact events with conspecifics that are located close to foraging areas our results show that consideration of the allocation of time to behavioral states is important for judging the risk of arctic rabies transmission in particular increased proportion of time engaged in foraging activities that align with reduced long distance movement strategies is likely to promote infectious contacts although several field and modeling studies have shown that the influence of resource availability can produce a large range of disease outcomes in foraging hosts reviewed in altizer et al 2018 becker et al 2015 rabies models incorporating behavioral state analysis provide an under explored avenue for investigating contact dynamics and rabies transmission 4 2 implications for arctic rabies management rabies management strategies that are traditionally used to prevent or control rabies virus circulation in wildlife include oral rabies vaccination orv trap vaccinate release population reduction and fertility control elmore et al 2017 sterner and smith 2006 our results revealed that contact rates between arctic foxes increased following a nonlinear saturating function of individual density suggesting that rabies transmission among arctic foxes should be intermediate between density and frequency dependent transmission consequently reduction in fox density may not be an optimal strategy as rabies transmission among arctic foxes is not only density dependent i e contact rates varying linearly with individual density rabies management under arctic conditions represents a challenge however orv has been shown to be effective for eliminating rabies among arctic foxes especially when areas containing high densities of foxes e g anthropogenic areas are targeted for bait distribution follmann et al 2011 2004 given that arctic foxes exhibit a high detection ability of localized food resources such as marine carrion on sea ice lai et al 2015 the use of feeding sites to deliver oral rabies vaccines may thus be an effective strategy on condition of minimizing risks to human and animal health e g exposure to pathogens becker et al 2015 civitello et al 2018 murray et al 2016 murray et al 2016 recommend to 1 provide nutritionally complete food for target host species 2 make food resources available at low densities for reduced time periods at unpredictable sites to avoid individual concentration which can increase pathogen transmission and 3 avoid feeding activities during epidemics host migration and birth pulses characterizing the spreading abilities of host individuals and in particular identifying super spreaders is of high interest for disease managers because control strategies targeting super spreaders will greatly increase the efficiency of control efforts compared to population level strategies lloyd smith et al 2005 we found that migrating and dispersing arctic foxes had more chance than nomadic and sedentary arctic foxes to act as super spreaders the multi annual cycles of lemming populations may shape large scale movements of arctic foxes angerbjorn et al 1999 norén et al 2011 in particular after a lemming peak a large number of lemming foxes may move over long distances across sea ice and immigrate into coastal habitats norén et al 2011 we expect that contact dynamics change when temporal fluctuations in prey resources are incorporated into the abm the cyclic nature of lemming populations is likely to affect the dynamics of rabies epizootics in a complex way for example simon et al 2019 found that strong demographic fluctuations in prey populations induced less regular and more intense rabies outbreaks with rabies epizootics not following the pattern of arctic fox density however there is little knowledge about seasonal variations in contact rates among arctic foxes simon et al 2020 in addition the main ecological drivers of large scale movements of arctic foxes are still unclear and more research is needed to identify them lai et al 2017 ideally denning sites for arctic foxes in inland lemming habitats should be targeted for future rabies control interventions using orv during the fall season before foxes potentially disperse or migrate to resource hotspots across sea ice the location of denning sites seems predictable as arctic foxes select preferentially south facing mounds or steep slopes sandy substrate and streamside cutbanks to excavate their dens szor et al 2008 however to date orv planning is challenging due to the difficulty to find active dens with fox presence in high arctic regions predicted probability maps of den site selection e g crupi et al 2020 davies et al 2016 would be useful for identifying sites with a high probability of fox den presence and supporting orv planning our abm describes density dependent transmission of an infectious pathogen within a single host species however arctic rabies can be maintained by a secondary reservoir species the red fox vulpes vulpes which has expanded its range into habitats occupied by the arctic fox elmhagen et al 2017 simon et al 2019 this range expansion can be attributed to an increase in food resources resulting from climate warming and increased human activities in the north elmhagen et al 2017 gallant et al 2020 hersteinsson and macdonald 1992 red foxes and arctic foxes compete for food and shelters which can lead to interference competition through aggression and predation by the red fox elmhagen et al 2002 pamperin et al 2006 rodnikova et al 2011 and thus increase the risk of rabies virus transmission between the two species our abm could be extended by incorporating multiple species and real landscapes to achieve a better understanding of the consequences of environmental changes on spread and transmission dynamics of rabies in the arctic the application of the abm to such a more complex system will be an important next step in this line of research data accessibility the argos data are

24262,arctic rabies is an ongoing threat to human populations and domestic animals inpolar regions where arctic foxes vulpes lagopus are the main reservoir hosts human driven changes in resource availability are shifting the distribution of arctic foxes and these changes may affect the risk of rabies transmission and spread our understanding of the effects of broad scale movement strategies in arctic foxes and spatial distribution of resources on contact patterns among arctic foxes and their consequences on the dynamics of rabies epidemiology remains limited in part due to the difficulty of obtaining contact data from such remote and expansive regions in this perspective we built a spatially explicit agent based model coupled with hidden markov models to explore how arctic fox movement behavior combined with arctic fox population density resource availability and rabies transmission dynamics affects the risk of infectious contact between arctic foxes across heterogeneous landscapes the model was parameterized using a combination of unique field data collected in the canadian high arctic and published studies from other arctic regions a sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the effects of multiple model input parameters on contact rates among arctic foxes our results showed that cumulative contact rates per fox were driven by predictors related to rabies transmission dynamics and fox carrying capacity while unique contact rates per fox and unique infectious contact rates per rabid fox were best predicted by parameters associated with rabies transmission dynamics fox movement behavior and fox carrying capacity ultimately our study provides new insights into the ecological drivers of rabies transmission and may inspire further research on modelling cost effective rabies prevention strategies in the arctic keywords arctic rabies vulpes lagopus spatially explicit agent based model animal movement contact rate hidden markov model data availability data and code will be made available on request 1 introduction heterogeneity in the rate at which infectious individuals come into contact and transmit pathogens to susceptible individuals plays a key role in infectious disease dynamics wilson et al 2002 some hosts can contribute disproportionately to pathogen spread which can lead to super spreading events lloyd smith et al 2005 woolhouse et al 1997 proposed the 20 80 rule whereby 20 of the most infectious hosts in a given population are responsible for at least 80 of pathogen transmission because heterogeneity in pathogen transmission has major implications for disease management and prevention vanderwaal and ezenwa 2016 it is important to identify the mechanisms inducing individual variation in the probability of transmitting pathogens given contact differences in physiology and behavior among hosts can contribute to such variation in pathogen acquisition vanderwaal and ezenwa 2016 host behavior is an important component for directly transmitted diseases i e those requiring contact between a susceptible and an infectious individual in particular when space use patterns affect the contact risk among potential hosts johnson and hoverman 2014 vanderwaal and ezenwa 2016 while social interactions can induce large variation in contact rates between individuals and create situations that facilitate pathogen transmission in the landscape altizer et al 2003 movement patterns can also influence the number of contacts between individuals movement behavior can be characterized at different temporal and spatial scales benhamou 2014 at coarse temporal resolutions animal movement is often categorized into four strategies migration dispersal nomadism and sedentarism sensu bastille rousseau et al 2016 while at finer temporal scales movement can be classified as behavioral states e g resting searching foraging fryxell et al 2008 changes in movement behavior are driven by trade offs between the costs of moving e g energy loss risk of mortality and the benefits of resource acquisition bonte et al 2012 and these changes can affect infectious disease dynamics in wildlife while the interest of understanding the causes and ecosystem level consequences of broad scale animal movement strategies has led to the development of multiple modeling approaches reviewed in joo et al 2020 few studies have explored the effects of different broad scale host movement strategies on zoonotic pathogen transmission e g migration vs sedentarism pruvot et al 2016 rayl et al 2021 there are thus opportunities to use movement based behavioral analyses to explore pathogen transmission risk among individuals dougherty et al 2018 rabies is one of the most widespread zoonotic diseases that threaten human and animal health fooks et al 2014 this virus is responsible for approximately 59 000 human deaths worldwide and 8 6 billion us dollars in economic losses per year hampson et al 2015 several distinct strains of rabies virus circulate in multiple species of wild mammals baer 1991 warrell and warrell 2004 the arctic strain of rabies is observed throughout arctic and sub arctic regions where the virus remains enzootic in wildlife crandell 1991 thus posing a significant threat to public health mediouni et al 2020 a person can contract rabies following a bite by a rabid wild animal or a domestic dog that became infected as a result of contact with a rabid wild animal mørk and prestrud 2004 the arctic fox vulpes lagopus is regarded as the primary reservoir host for arctic rabies mørk and prestrud 2004 simon et al 2020 arctic foxes are both opportunistic predators and scavengers of a wide variety of prey and have a circumpolar distribution that spans inland and coastal habitats varying in rodent availability which induces differences in feeding strategies angerbjörn et al 2004 arctic foxes relying on rodents such as lemmings are highly dependent on cyclical rodent population pulses occurring every three to five years bêty et al 2002 consequently these lemming foxes can have large litters up to 19 cubs but show high variation in breeding success tannerfeldt and angerbjörn 1998 in contrast arctic foxes living in coastal habitats where cyclic rodents are absent like svalbard iceland and west greenland have access to relatively stable and predictable food resources among years and their diet is diversified consisting of many marine food items that are largely available in summer but limited in winter e g carcasses of marine mammals and seabirds crustaceans and fishes berteaux et al 2017 hersteinsson and macdonald 1996 prestrud 1992 consequently these foxes produce fewer cubs per litter and their reproduction patterns are more stable compared to lemming foxes tannerfeldt and angerbjörn 1998 resource availability also has a large influence on movement behavior of arctic foxes it has been suggested that lemming foxes may travel longer distances than coastal ones in response to food shortages angerbjörn et al 2004 in this context changes in arctic fox movement behavior could affect the risk of contact between individuals with implications for rabies virus transmission several rabies models often involving raccoons red foxes skunks and bats have been used to investigate the influence of host density host behavior including movement and habitat selection and landscape features i e landscape composition and configuration on rabies transmission and spread dynamics or contact risk brunker et al 2018 sararat et al 2022 smith et al 2002 tardy et al 2018 and to test rabies control strategies mcclure et al 2022 2020 newton et al 2019 however we lack an understanding of how arctic fox movement behavior affects arctic rabies transmission dynamics partly due to the difficulty of obtaining contact data from remote and expansive areas of arctic and sub arctic regions in addition the majority of existing arctic rabies models do not explicitly incorporate mechanistic links between arctic fox movement and landscape heterogeneity moran et al 2021 2022 simon et al 2019 which can lead to less accurate predictions of transmission events fofana and hurford 2017 we built a spatially explicit agent based model abm coupled with hidden markov models to explore how broad scale arctic fox movement strategies in concert with arctic fox population density spatial distribution of resources and rabies transmission dynamics affect the risk of virus transmission among arctic foxes across spatially heterogeneous landscapes the objective of this study was addressed in two steps first we identified different broad scale arctic fox movement strategies using multi year argos satellite data then we quantified the relative influence of multiple abm input parameters and explored their relationships with different metrics of contact rates through a global sensitivity analysis using the abm we simulated arctic fox populations varying in broad scale movement strategies and individual densities across theoretical landscapes that differed in spatial aggregation of resources 2 materials and methods 2 1 characterization of broad scale movement strategies we identified broad scale movement strategies in 41 satellite tracked arctic foxes using net squared displacement nsd statistics with a discrete latent state model a type of hidden markov model bastille rousseau et al 2016 see the subsection model parameterization for more details on telemetry data the approach combining nsd statistics and a latent state model consisted in calculating nsd values from argos derived locations for each individual and fitting the frequency distribution of the nsd values with a latent state model based on a mixture of two normal distributions and one pseudo uniform distribution bastille rousseau et al 2016 the nsd is calculated as the square of the euclidean distance between the first location of an individual and each subsequent location of its movement path bunnefeld et al 2011 turchin 1998 a latent state model defines three movement modes based on the frequency distribution of the nsd values two encamped modes 1 and 2 that correspond to different foraging areas where movements are slow and meandering and one exploratory mode 3 that is equivalent to a transitional movement mode allowing for fast and directed movements between these areas bastille rousseau et al 2016 the modes 1 and 2 are characterized by a normal distribution of the nsd values while the mode 3 is defined by a pseudo uniform distribution of the nsd values bastille rousseau et al 2016 the latent state model takes into consideration the temporal autocorrelation present in nsd time series and satisfies the markov property according to which the behavioral state at a given time depends on the state at the previous time which makes it possible to investigate the probabilities of switching between movement modes see bastille rousseau et al 2016 for the full expression of the likelihood of the latent state model the criteria used to differentiate movement strategies are based on a 3 3 matrix representing the probability of being in movement mode j at time t 1 given that the individual was in mode i at time t q i j for i j 1 2 3 and the number of transitions between each mode see bastille rousseau et al 2016 for further details a bayesian modeling framework based on markov chain monte carlomethods is used for estimating parameters bastille rousseau et al 2016 for each fox we ran a model using three markov chains and 5000 iterations when the model did not converge we reran the model by increasing the number of iterations up to 250 000 iterations the model was validated by visually comparing the nsd time series to those in bunnefeld et al 2011 double sigmoid function migration sigmoid function dispersal linear function nomadism and horizontal asymptotic function sedentarism see also fig 1 in bastille rousseau et al 2016 finally we tested how the characterization of movement strategies was sensitive to the starting date of the nsd time series using a clustering technique see bastille rousseau et al 2016 for more details we varied the start date over the first 70 days of locations by taking 10 windows of locations of 7 days and we ran the models with 25 000 iterations the analysis of movement strategies using nsd statistics with a latent state model was performed with the lsmnsd package version 0 0 0 9000 bastille rousseau et al 2016 in the r statistical software version 3 6 1 r development core team 2019 2 2 model overview in this section we provide a detailed abm description following the overview design concepts and details odd protocol grimm et al 2006 2010 2020 the model was implemented in r using the netlogor package version 0 3 7 bauduin et al 2019 2 2 1 purpose and patterns the abm is designed to simulate broad scale movement strategies of arctic foxes from hidden markov models hmms that were parameterized with telemetry location data and in which we incorporated covariates using this modeling framework in an epidemiological context the purpose of the abm is to identify the primary drivers of the risk of rabies transmission between arctic foxes among host specific movement and carrying capacity environmental resource availability and epidemiological predictors and to explore their relationships across spatially heterogeneous landscapes given that rabies transmission events are broadly dependent on mechanisms modulating contact rates we explored cumulative and unique contact patterns among simulated arctic foxes emerging from the mechanistic movement process implemented in the abm the integration of a rabies transmission process in the abm provides the possibility of evaluating the risk of rabies transmission between arctic foxes through the analysis of unique infectious contact rates per rabid individual 2 2 2 entities state variables and scales the abm integrates two layers representing the landscape and simulated arctic foxes two types of entities are thus included in the model landscape cells and arctic foxes that are modelled as mobile individuals occupying the cells state variables associated with each entity are either static fixed during a given simulation or dynamic updated at each time step and are listed in table 1 as experiments involving a range of large landscapes with controlled spatial distribution of resources are often difficult to carry out and replicate we generated a set of theoretical landscapes varying in spatial aggregation clustering of resources from mean zero and variance one gaussian random fields grfs with an exponential covariance function fig b 1 in appendix b similarly to forester et al 2009 we assumed that there is no nugget effect grfs have been used in several studies to model the spatial dependence of ecological processes such as animal movement e g aarts et al 2013 bracis et al 2015 dupont et al 2021 our theoretical landscapes consisted of a grid of 700 rows 700 columns cells with a cell resolution of 1 km which represents an area of 490 000 km² the scale parameter ϕ g that controls the level of autocorrelation between the grid cells varied from 10 to 250 ϕ g 10 25 50 150 and 250 high values of ϕ g generate landscapes composed of highly aggregated resources while at low values of ϕ g resources are randomly distributed in the landscape to improve the visual interpretation of the resulting resource gradient the grf values were scaled between 0 and 1 using a linear stretch method johnson et al 2004 that takes the form g x w x w min w max w min the term w x represents the grf values at each location x x y in the landscape and w min and w max correspond to the smallest and highest grf values respectively the values of g can be interpreted as estimating the probability that the spatial location is in a resource rich area tardy et al 2021 for each landscape we identified hotspots as areas of high resource availability where the values of g were above a threshold value h t g which varied from 0 6 to 0 8 high values of h t g reduce the number of hotspots in the landscape the center of each hotspot was defined as the location with the highest value of g lai et al 2015 the abm runs at discrete time steps of one hour 2 2 3 process overview and scheduling the arctic fox layer depends on the landscape layer based on two ecological processes that are described in the subsection submodels 1 arctic fox movement and 2 rabies transmission the abm evolves in a cell based setting bian 2003 in which the ecological processes act at the cell scale consequently the context dependencies i e conspecific density and resource availability operating in the movement process act at this scale fox individuals that are present in a given cell define a distinct open population i e experiencing recruitment through immigrations or losses through deaths and emigrations for simplicity we assumed that the populations of simulated arctic foxes were geographically closed i e no death immigration or emigration from outside the landscape all simulations were performed over a total period of 5000 h 208 days which corresponds to the sea ice period october 25 may 31 at each time step each simulated arctic fox can move to another cell according to movement rules that are defined from hmms once individual locations are updated rabies transmission success is evaluated between a susceptible fox and an infectious fox fig 1 the simulation ends when the maximum number of steps is reached i e 5000 steps to avoid having simulated arctic foxes moving all the time within the landscape 2 2 4 design concepts the current version of the abm does not include collectives basic principles given the ability of arctic foxes to detect food resources on sea ice lai et al 2015 the abm integrates a foraging movement process that involves two phases emigration from the den and transfer towards a hotspot in which context dependencies operate at the cell scale the foraging trip during the transfer phase is modelled using hmms that segment movement trajectories into different behavioral states based on time series of step lengths and turning angles langrock et al 2012 zucchini et al 2017 most input parameters of the simulated hmms were estimated from satellite tracked arctic fox location data associated with four movement strategies i e migration dispersal nomadism and sedentarism see the subsection characterization of broad scale movement strategies in the section results the hmms were used to calculate state switching probabilities as a function of covariates which allows modulating behavioral decisions of arctic foxes in response to environmental conditions the abm thus differs from other arctic rabies models moran et al 2021 2022 simon et al 2019 in that our model explicitly describes arctic fox movement behavior and its interaction with the environment emergence the simulated movement patterns associated with the four strategies i e migration dispersal nomadism and sedentarism are affected by landscape characteristics combined with stochasticity in the movement process this leads to the emergence of heterogeneous spatial distribution patterns among simulated arctic foxes giving rise to spatial heterogeneity in contact rates between individuals adaptation during the emigration phase simulated arctic foxes decide to leave their natal cell or den based on the number of conspecifics within the cell the probability of emigrating from the natal cell increases with increasing conspecific abundance when an arctic fox emigrates the individual enters the transfer phase and moves to a landscape cell determined by the hidden markov state process the latter is simulated at each time step from an estimated state transition probability matrix the probabilities of transitioning from one state to another depend on three covariates distance from the current location to a hotspot the time since departure from the den or natal cell and resource availability see the subsection submodels for more details on the movement process objectives simulated arctic foxes move towards foraging areas within the landscape based on the sequences of foraging trips observed in satellite tracked arctic foxes the movement trajectories of simulated foxes reflect a fitness seeking behavior with a larger amount of time spent in foraging rather than resource searching behavior see the subsection state sequences of foraging trips in the section results individuals can be constrained to forage in close proximity or away from their natal cell or den depending upon the hotspot locations learning simulated arctic foxes change their behavior over time as a function of their previous experiences these changes were modelled through simulated hmms in which the behavioral state process has a markov property such that the future state depends on the current state with the aim of predicting future movement fitted hmms that were used to parameterize the simulated hmms were applied in an unsupervised learning context to infer behavioral states from movement data in an unsupervised learning context behavioral state classification is based on step length and turning angle distributions and is not validated by direct observations of behaviors prediction in the simulated hmms of the abm the behavioral state process that is characterized by a transition probability matrix predicts the future state of simulated arctic foxes given their current state the choice of the next cell thus relies on the previous experience with the objective for foxes to reach a hotspot or return to their den after a certain period of time more information on the behavioral state process is given in the subsection submodels sensing simulated arctic foxes have knowledge of conspecific density and habitat quality in their natal cell individuals move according to what they perceive in the landscape and can detect the presence of hotspots within their perceptual range interaction intraspecific competition for resources is implicitly modelled in the abm density dependence in the emigration process operates at the cell scale where the presence of conspecifics is used as a cue for habitat quality individuals are more likely to leave their natal cell or den when conspecific density is high in the cell stochasticity the theoretical landscapes are generated from grfs which gives rise to stochasticity in the spatial distribution of resources some abm input parameters are drawn from probability distributions table 2 stochasticity is also introduced into the abm through the arctic fox movement and rabies transmission processes where the occurrence of an emigration or transmission event is determined by a bernoulli trial finally the hmms used in the arctic fox movement process are stochastic models where each behavioral state is defined by a random walk see the subsection submodels for more details on the simulated hmms observation all dynamic state variables of each simulated arctic fox are saved at the end of each time step in particular the location of the current cell the health state and the success of rabies transmission are used to calculate the number of cumulative and unique contacts for each arctic fox as well as the number of unique infectious contacts for each rabid individual within a given cell at each time step the average number of different contacts is saved after each simulation given that contacts can be distributed in different ways among individuals tardy et al 2018 e g five contacts for a given individual can be distributed as either five contacts with one conspecific or one contact with five different conspecifics we calculated the average number of cumulative contacts per arctic fox i e the average number of conspecifics that have been in direct contact with a simulated fox and the average number of unique contacts per arctic fox i e the average number of different conspecifics that have been in direct contact with a simulated fox we also computed the average number of unique infectious contacts per rabid arctic fox i e the average number of different conspecifics that have been exposed to rabies following a direct contact with a simulated infectious fox these metrics provide different information about contact events cumulative contact rates influence the probability of transmitting or contracting pathogens whereas unique contact rates inform on the risk of super spreading events tardy et al 2018 a direct contact between two simulated arctic foxes occurred when both foxes were present in the same cell at a given time finally we calculated the proportion of time spent in each behavioral state characterizing the simulated foraging trip of each migrating dispersing nomadic or sedentary arctic fox using the viberti algorithm see the subsection model parameterization for more details the average proportion of time spent in each state is saved after each simulation 2 2 5 initialization uninfected foxes are randomly distributed in the landscape cells with a number of individuals equal to k at least 100 cells apart from study area boundaries to avoid edge effects we modelled rabies transmission dynamics by allowing a proportion of infectious foxes η r to transmit the virus to their conspecifics infectious foxes displayed either a dumb or furious behavior see the subsection submodels for more details on the rabies transmission process the landscape cells in which each fox is located at the initial time are defined as natal cells or dens a hotspot was randomly assigned to each migrating and dispersing arctic fox the abm does not use input data to represent time varying processes 2 2 6 submodels in the abm we integrated two submodels corresponding to two ecological processes arctic fox movement and rabies transmission arctic fox movement each arctic fox has a probability of leaving its natal cell or den at a given time step t and this probability depends on the presence of conspecifics in the cell the emigration probability p e is given by the following function introduced by kun and scheuring 2006 p e d m a x e 1 e n i t k i b e a e where n i t represents the number of simulated arctic foxes in cell i at time t k i corresponds to the carrying capacity of foxes in cell i and d m a x e is the maximum emigration probability the parameters b e and a e define the inflection point of the density dependent emigration function and the slope at the inflection point of the function respectively a bernoulli trial determines if the arctic fox emigrates or not from its natal cell when the simulated fox does not emigrate from its natal cell i e when b e r n p e 0 the fox stays in its natal cell and assumes a resting state in the case where the fox emigrates from its natal cell i e when b e r n p e 1 we simulated fox movement from hmms whose most input parameters were estimated by fitting hmms to argos derived locations of arctic foxes having movement patterns indicative of four movement strategies i e migration dispersal nomadism and sedentarism table 2 full details on the telemetry location data can be found in the subsection model parameterization we assumed that the trajectories of migrating foxes consisted of four behavioral states sensu michelot et al 2017 1 outbound state o where movement is fast and highly directed from a den or natal cell to a resource rich area or hotspot 2 search state s where movement is moderately fast with some directional persistence near the hotspot 3 forage state f where movement is slow and non directed within the hotspot and 4 inbound state or return i where movement is fast and highly directed from the hotspot to the den fig 2 for arctic foxes displaying a dispersal strategy we considered three states to distinguish outbound search and forage behaviors without a return trip towards the den fig 2 finally we assumed that foxes in nomadic and sedentary movement strategies alternated between search and forage states and these strategies differed in terms of step lengths and turning angles with more concentrated movements around the den for the sedentary behavior fig 2 the arctic fox movement in the search and forage states was modelled using correlated random walks crws where turning angles were drawn from a von mises distribution with mean λ and concentration κ large κ values imply low variance of the von mises distribution and consequently high directional persistence we modelled the fox movement in the outbound and inbound states using biased random walks brws with attraction towards either the hotspot in the outbound state or the den in the inbound state by assuming that turning angles followed a von mises distribution with mean ϕ t and concentration κ where ϕ t arctan y p y t x p x t is the direction of the vector pointing from the current location x t y t to a focal point x p y p i e the hotspot or den for each state we used a gamma distribution to draw step lengths we used a non observable hidden state process s t o s f i to describe state switching dynamics the state process is governed by a first order markov chain and when combined with the observation process in which the behavioral states are modelled by the types of random walks conditional on the current state defines a hidden markov model zucchini et al 2017 for arctic fox movement assuming that the occurrence of a future state at time t 1 depends on the current state at time t the state process s t was characterized by transition probabilities as follows γ γ oo γ os 0 0 0 γ ss γ sf γ si 0 γ fs γ ff 0 0 0 0 γ ii where γ ij pr s t 1 j s t i for i j o s f i the probabilities that are non zero allow the process to switch from one state to another state we prevented some transitions by setting probabilities to zero the matrix γ was adjusted according to each movement strategy e g the matrix γ considered above corresponds to the migration strategy the transition probabilities were expressed as a function of three covariates i distance from the current location to a hotspot at time t d t to model the fact that migrating or dispersing foxes make fast and directed movements away from their den and tend to switch into other movement states once they reach a hotspot ii the time since departure from the den t t 0 to model the return towards the den and iii resource availability g in the landscape to integrate another key aspect of foraging behavior whereby individuals tend to switch from a searching state to a foraging state with increasing resource availability with tortuous and shorter movements in resource rich areas compared to resource poor areas the covariate d t influenced the probability of switching from the outbound state to the search state γ o s as follows γ os e η os 1 e η os where η os β 0 os β d t os d t the covariate t t 0 affected the probability of switching from the search state to the inbound state γ s i as there are several non zero probabilities from the search state i e γ s f and γ s i the transition probability γ s i depended on the covariate t t 0 through a multinomial logit link as follows γ si e η si 1 e η sf e η si where η si β 0 si β t t 0 si t t 0 the values of g that were considered fixed over time influenced the probabilities of switching from the search state to the forage state γ s f and from the forage state to the search state γ f s as follows γ sf e η sf 1 e η sf e η si and γ fs e η fs 1 e η fs where η sf β 0 sf β g sf g and η fs β 0 fs β g fs g the parameters β 0 o s β d t o s β 0 s i and β t t 0 s i as well as the parameters for the step length and turning angle distributions were estimated from the argos derived location data see the subsection model parameterization for further details on the fitted hmms for example this results in eight parameters for the gamma distributed steps and six parameters for the von mises distributed angles to estimate in the observation process of the four state hmms associated with the migration strategy table 2 the mean parameters of turning angles for the outbound and inbound states were fixed to a large positive number i e 100 to define the bias towards the hotspot or den mcclintock and michelot 2018 due to constraints of environmental data availability the range of possible values for the input parameters associated with the transition probabilities depending on the value of g i e β 0 s f β g s f β 0 f s and β g f s was chosen via a simple trial and error calibration procedure because precision was not necessary to evaluate the effects of movement strategies on contact rates among simulated arctic foxes the remaining elements of the transition probability matrix were obtained so that the rows of the matrix sum to one and thus varied with time the fitted hmm parameters were converted into hourly values to parameterize the simulated hmms of the abm a simulated foraging trip started in the outbound state for the migration and dispersal type movement strategies and in the search state for the nomadism and sedentarism type strategies at each time step the state process was simulated from the estimated transition probabilities and a turning angle and a step length were then simulated from the estimated von mises and gamma distributions respectively rabies transmission rabies transmission events are evaluated at each time step virus transmission which requires direct contact could occur between simulated arctic foxes when a susceptible fox i e unexposed to rabies and an infectious fox shared the same cell during the same time step the probability that a susceptible fox becomes infected i e exposed to the virus but not yet infectious was defined by p r t 1 1 ρ c ε i i t where i i t represents the number of infectious foxes in the same cell i at time t ρ c corresponds to the rabies transmission probability and ε defines the probability of encountering conspecifics a bernoulli trial determines the success of rabies transmission we varied the rabies transmission probability ρ c according to behavioral changes from rabies infection i e furious when the animal is dominated by aggressive behavior or dumb when the animal is characterized by increased paralysis mørk and prestrud 2004 the rabies transmission probability between a susceptible fox and a rabid fox increased when rabid foxes displayed aggressive behavior whereas the transmission probability decreased when rabid foxes had dumb behavior in the abm exposed arctic foxes became infectious after an incubation period υ given that high virulence of rabies contributes to very low levels of natural immunity blancou et al 2009 and serological surveys of arctic fox populations are rare but see ballard et al 2001 for an example we supposed that rabies was 100 lethal after an infectious period γ similarly to moran et al 2021 the incubation and infectious periods were simulated from an erlang distribution i e gamma distribution with an integer shape parameter krylova and earn 2013 2 3 model parameterization the abm input parameters associated with arctic fox carrying capacity and rabies transmission were defined from empirical and modeling studies on the arctic fox and rabies virus most input parameters related to the arctic fox movement process were estimated by fitting hmms to satellite tracked arctic fox location data in total 41 adult arctic foxes were initially captured on bylot island nunavut canada from 2009 to 2014 and were tracked with argos satellite collars that were programmed to transmit daily locations during one year raw satellite data were filtered and one location per day per individual was kept based on the smallest location error details on the capture procedure and telemetry data including duty cycles and filtering are given in lai et al 2017 we estimated missing daily locations 9 31 of total locations using continuous time correlated random walk models as described in johnson et al 2008 to reduce uncertainty inherent to movement data for our analyses we selected movement records that encompassed one complete winter season corresponding to the sea ice period october 25 may 31 table a 1 in appendix a the sea ice period is of particular interest to explore various movement behaviors of arctic foxes tarroux et al 2010 before performing the fitting of hmms we removed highly stationary location data based on one dimensional time series plots of the locations given that these data give little information and can increase numerical instability michelot et al 2017 for the process of fitting hmms to the telemetry location data a cluster analysis was performed using migrating and dispersing arctic fox locations to identify hotspot centroids we used the tadpole clustering algorithm implemented in the dtwclust package version 5 5 10 sardá espinosa 2019 in r and based on 10 clusters a cutoff distance of 1500 m and a window size of 1 day each cluster was visualized for all individuals and we selected one cluster for each individual to reflect the location of key activity centers hmm goodness of fit was evaluated for each movement strategy i e migration dispersal nomadism and sedentarism by checking the normality and temporal independence of pseudo residuals for step lengths and turning angles for simplicity and as explaining individual variation in transition probabilities was not our central goal we modelled the behavioral states of all individuals combined without considering individual level random effects in the hmms mcclintock 2021 the hmm fitting to the telemetry data was performed with the momentuhmm package version 1 5 1 mcclintock and michelot 2018 in r in this package the viterbi algorithm is used to determine the most likely sequence of behavioral states zucchini et al 2017 and the hmm parameters are estimated by likelihood maximization using a recursive algorithm called the forward algorithm zucchini et al 2017 which requires the specification of good starting values for step lengths and turning angles following the recommendations of michelot et al 2016 we fitted hmms with several sets of starting values n 50 that were generated from a uniform distribution and we selected the best fitting hmm with the largest likelihood 2 4 sensitivity analysis we performed a global sensitivity analysis sa to evaluate the sensitivity of arctic fox contact patterns to variations in abm input parameters a total of 14 input parameters were included in the sa table 2 level of autocorrelation between the landscape grid

a and probability of encountering conspecifics ε we used a latin hypercube sampling scheme to sample 150 different parameter combinations from a uniform probability distribution satisfying the minimum value of 4 n 3 where n is the number of input parameters mckay et al 1979 because our abm included stochasticity in the spatial distribution of resources due to the stochastic algorithm of grfs we generated 10 replicated landscapes for each parameter combination resulting in a total of 1500 simulations similarly to our previous papers tardy et al 2021 2022 we built boosted regression tree brt models elith et al 2008 to assess the relative contribution of each input parameter in predicting abm output variables and to identify which of the parameters had the highest effect on these output variables we used the average number of cumulative contacts per arctic fox the average number of unique contacts per arctic fox and the average number of unique infectious contacts per rabid arctic fox as output variables a gaussian error structure was used for the loss function of the brt models the contact rates were log transformed in the brt models to achieve variance homogeneity and to obtain gaussian error distributions we tested several combinations of learning rate 0 01 0 005 0 001 tree complexity 1 5 and bag fraction 0 5 0 7 0 9 to determine optimal settings for the brt models we selected the parameter combination with the lowest 10 fold cross validation deviance to fit the final brt model we also evaluated the relative contribution of the input parameters based on their effect on the ecological processes that are implemented in the abm the input parameters belonged to four categories landscape carrying capacity of arctic foxes arctic fox movement and rabies transmission table 2 we visualized the relationships between the output variables and the most influential input parameters with partial dependence plots in which 95 confidence intervals were obtained from 500 bootstrap replicates we tested the significance of the strongest interactions using 100 bootstrap resampling iterations pinsky and byler 2015 the brt models were built from the dismo version 1 1 4 and ggbrt version 0 0 0 9000 packages in r hijmans et al 2020 jouffray et al 2019 3 results 3 1 broad scale movement strategies the analysis of the nsd time series of arctic foxes n 41 using nsd statistics with a latent state model showed inter individual variations in coarse scale movement strategies we found that 66 n 27 of arctic foxes were sedentary individuals with probabilities of switching from one movement mode to another of q 22 0 90 and q 33 0 90 the results also revealed that 12 n 5 of foxes had patterns of transition between the modes similar to nomadic strategy q 11 0 95 q 22 0 90 and q 33 0 85 and 12 n 5 of foxes displayed dispersal behavior q 11 0 95 q 22 0 95 and q 33 0 85 finally 10 n 4 of foxes showed migration behavior with transition probabilities of q 11 0 95 q 22 0 95 and q 33 0 85 together with the presence of transition back from the second encamped mode the classification of large scale movement strategies in arctic foxes was not sensitive to variation in the starting date of the nsd time series on average overall agreement for the classification of strategies was 91 range 72 100 at the daily level we found that 82 of monitoring days had 80 agreement range 28 100 among the iterations and 65 of days had 95 agreement range 9 100 3 2 state sequences of foraging trips given the fitted hmms for each movement strategy the analysis of pseudo residuals for the step lengths and turning angles showed that the pseudo residuals were approximately normally distributed fig c 1 c 4 in appendix c there was some autocorrelation in the pseudo residuals in particular for the step lengths from the 2 state hmm fitted to the argos tracking data of sedentary arctic foxes fig c 1 c 4 in appendix c which can suggest the need for adding more states or covariates however model complexity can make biological interpretation of states difficult and lead to unstable parameter estimation pohle et al 2017 our choice of the number of states was based on the results of the analysis of the nsd time series using nsd statistics with a latent state model as well as the ecology of arctic foxes and the constraints of available environmental data the fitted hmms revealed that sedentary arctic foxes spent 79 of their time foraging range 44 100 and 23 of their time searching for resource rich foraging areas range 1 56 nomadic arctic foxes were in the foraging state 80 of their time range 70 91 and in the searching state 20 of their time range 9 30 we found that migrating foxes allocated 39 of their time to foraging behavior range 5 59 25 of their time searching for resource rich foraging areas range 20 33 21 of their time to the inbound trip from the foraging area or hotspot to the den range 10 45 and 15 of their time to the outbound trip from the den to the foraging area range 5 30 dispersing foxes were in the outbound trip 41 of their time range 3 77 in the foraging state 40 of their time range 14 83 and in the searching state 19 of their time range 2 39 in addition the fitted hmms showed that the transition probabilities from outbound to search states for arctic foxes displaying migration and dispersal behaviors decreased with increasing distance to the hotspot migrating and dispersing arctic foxes tended to perform searching activities for resource rich areas when they were located at less than 400 km from these areas fig 3 a and b finally we observed that the transition probabilities from search to inbound states for arctic foxes having migration behavior increased when the time since departure from the den was high migrating foxes tended to start returning to their den after about 60 days fig 3 c these patterns were reproduced by the abm 3 3 contact rates among arctic foxes the brt models performed well for quantifying the relative contribution of each abm input parameter on contact rates among arctic foxes with 10 fold cross validation deviance explained ranging from 82 to 99 and with cross validated correlation ranging from 0 91 to 0 99 table d 1 in appendix d in the sections below we describe the relationships between contact rates among arctic foxes and the most influential input parameters 10

fig 5 a two sided pairwise wilcoxon rank sum test with bonferroni correction w 35 811 and p 0 0001 there were also significant differences in unique contact rates between these two strategies and

and animal health mørk and prestrud 2004 despite a growing body of literature covering the ecology of arctic foxes important knowledge gaps exist regarding the ecology of the arctic rabies virus which includes the influence of host behavior on rabies transmission events simon et al 2020 in particular the ecological processes modulating contact rates among arctic foxes are often speculative limiting our understanding of the consequences of environmental changes on rabies dynamics in the arctic we built the first spatially explicit agent based model for arctic fox rabies in which hmms were used to mechanistically simulate broad scale movement strategies migration dispersal nomadism and sedentarism in arctic foxes our results showed that rabies transmission dynamics and fox carrying capacity were key predictors of cumulative contact rates among arctic foxes while rabies transmission dynamics fox movement behavior and fox carrying capacity determined unique contact rates 4 1 contact patterns in arctic fox populations we found differences between cumulative and unique contact rates our results revealed that low prevalence of rabies among arctic foxes 0 0 2 and increased carrying capacities of arctic foxes 0 07 0 1 foxes km² resulted in high cumulative contact rates between arctic foxes with an increase in fox home range overlap tending to occur in areas where resources were clustered and scarce hotspots with resource availability values 0 78 in our study low prevalence of rabies allows maintaining arctic fox populations at high density levels preventing their extinction field studies showed that prevalence of rabies was low among arctic foxes 0 3 3 suggesting that the virus is not endemic in local arctic fox populations but is occasionally introduced by foxes migrating on sea ice prestrud et al 1992 from the abm simulations cumulative contact rates increased nonlinearly with arctic fox density and tended to saturate at higher individual densities indicating that rabies transmission among arctic foxes should be intermediate between density and frequency dependent transmission smith et al 2009 the nonlinear nature of the relationship between contact rates and individual density results from changes in state switching movement dynamics with resource availability our results showed a higher relative influence of the landscape on the number of cumulative contacts per fox compared to the number of unique contacts per fox landscape heterogeneity can produce scarce hotspots of resources and resource scarcity can lead to higher arctic fox densities around scavenged carcasses and thus create opportunities for pathogen transmission by close contact simon et al 2020 for example arctic foxes can congregate in large numbers in resource rich areas during extraterritorial foraging of adults in winter december february which can increase contact rates between individuals lai et al 2015 in addition our results revealed that low prevalence of rabies among arctic foxes 0 0 2 dispersal type movement strategy and increased carrying capacities of arctic foxes 0 07 0 1 foxes km² induced high unique contact rates between arctic foxes using the abm simulations we observed that unique contact rates increased among dispersing arctic foxes when they allocated 50 of their time to the outbound trip suggesting areas at highest risk for unique contacts between dispersing arctic foxes are those not too far away from dens the outbound trip which is characterized by fast and highly directed movements occurs when a fox leaves its den to search for new resources it then follows a transitional phase of searching activity where movement is moderately fast with some directional persistence near resource rich areas between the outbound state and the foraging state where movement is slow and non directed within resource rich areas dispersing arctic foxes investing more time in searching and foraging activities 50 of their time were more likely to have contact with different conspecifics this pattern was also observed for arctic foxes displaying a migration type movement strategy the second at risk strategy these foxes exhibited higher unique contact rates when they spent 40 of their time in the outbound state from the fitted hmms migrating and dispersing arctic foxes tended to engage in searching activities for resource rich areas when they were located less than 400 km from these areas despite a large number of studies showing the important role of animal migration in long distance spread of pathogens fritzsche mckay and hoye 2016 risely et al 2018 satterfield et al 2018 the demonstration of the impact of dispersal behavior on pathogen transmission remains limited boulinier et al 2016 our results suggest that the dispersal type movement strategy has the potential to act as a super spreading process as this strategy is likely to increase the number of unique contacts with other conspecifics compared to migration nomadism and sedentarism behaviors as observed for migrating host individuals teitelbaum et al 2018 it is expected that dispersing host individuals that visit multiple sites across a broad geographic range would be more likely to be exposed to a high number and diversity of pathogens owing to increased contacts with other host individuals shaw et al 2018 arctic foxes can move over long distances outside their home range lai et al 2017 tarroux et al 2010 for example an arctic fox travelled 4 415 km in four months between svalbard norway and ellesmere island canada fuglei and tarroux 2019 however our simulation results suggest that a dispersal strategy over such long distances is not the most critical for arctic rabies transmission it has been shown that reduced long distance movements of hosts could favor pathogen transmission by increasing host exposure to contaminated habitats where pathogens have accumulated in the environment over time hall et al 2014 finally we found that low prevalence of rabies among arctic foxes 0 0 2 increased carrying capacities of arctic foxes 0 07 0 1 foxes km² high infectious periods 4 7 days and long distance movement strategies i e migration and dispersal led to high unique infectious contact rates from rabid arctic foxes long infectious periods are required to favor infectious contacts and thus to maintain rabies even in populations at high arctic fox densities generally the infectious period of rabies varies between one and seven days and arctic foxes can die between one and three days after the onset of symptoms konovalov et al 1965 no significant difference in unique infectious contact patterns among arctic foxes was found between migration and dispersal strategies but these two strategies produced higher unique infectious contact rates compared to nomadism and sedentarism type movement strategies the trend observed in the unique infectious contact patterns among migrating and dispersing arctic foxes was similar to that found in the unique contact patterns with migrating and dispersing arctic foxes displaying higher unique infectious contact rates when they spent 40 and 50 of their time in the outbound trip respectively rather than in the other states unique infectious contact rates were amplified among dispersing arctic foxes when they invested more time in foraging activities 50 of their time while for migrating arctic foxes the chance to become infected after contact with a rabid conspecific increased when they allocated more time in both foraging and inbound trips 40 of their time to model the return to the den the state sequence alternates first with the foraging and searching trips and finally is forced to remain in the inbound trip until the end of a given simulation migrating arctic foxes increased their time spent in the inbound trip when they moved across several foraging areas and tended to cross previously visited areas in order to return to their den this can produce contact events with conspecifics that are located close to foraging areas our results show that consideration of the allocation of time to behavioral states is important for judging the risk of arctic rabies transmission in particular increased proportion of time engaged in foraging activities that align with reduced long distance movement strategies is likely to promote infectious contacts although several field and modeling studies have shown that the influence of resource availability can produce a large range of disease outcomes in foraging hosts reviewed in altizer et al 2018 becker et al 2015 rabies models incorporating behavioral state analysis provide an under explored avenue for investigating contact dynamics and rabies transmission 4 2 implications for arctic rabies management rabies management strategies that are traditionally used to prevent or control rabies virus circulation in wildlife include oral rabies vaccination orv trap vaccinate release population reduction and fertility control elmore et al 2017 sterner and smith 2006 our results revealed that contact rates between arctic foxes increased following a nonlinear saturating function of individual density suggesting that rabies transmission among arctic foxes should be intermediate between density and frequency dependent transmission consequently reduction in fox density may not be an optimal strategy as rabies transmission among arctic foxes is not only density dependent i e contact rates varying linearly with individual density rabies management under arctic conditions represents a challenge however orv has been shown to be effective for eliminating rabies among arctic foxes especially when areas containing high densities of foxes e g anthropogenic areas are targeted for bait distribution follmann et al 2011 2004 given that arctic foxes exhibit a high detection ability of localized food resources such as marine carrion on sea ice lai et al 2015 the use of feeding sites to deliver oral rabies vaccines may thus be an effective strategy on condition of minimizing risks to human and animal health e g exposure to pathogens becker et al 2015 civitello et al 2018 murray et al 2016 murray et al 2016 recommend to 1 provide nutritionally complete food for target host species 2 make food resources available at low densities for reduced time periods at unpredictable sites to avoid individual concentration which can increase pathogen transmission and 3 avoid feeding activities during epidemics host migration and birth pulses characterizing the spreading abilities of host individuals and in particular identifying super spreaders is of high interest for disease managers because control strategies targeting super spreaders will greatly increase the efficiency of control efforts compared to population level strategies lloyd smith et al 2005 we found that migrating and dispersing arctic foxes had more chance than nomadic and sedentary arctic foxes to act as super spreaders the multi annual cycles of lemming populations may shape large scale movements of arctic foxes angerbjorn et al 1999 norén et al 2011 in particular after a lemming peak a large number of lemming foxes may move over long distances across sea ice and immigrate into coastal habitats norén et al 2011 we expect that contact dynamics change when temporal fluctuations in prey resources are incorporated into the abm the cyclic nature of lemming populations is likely to affect the dynamics of rabies epizootics in a complex way for example simon et al 2019 found that strong demographic fluctuations in prey populations induced less regular and more intense rabies outbreaks with rabies epizootics not following the pattern of arctic fox density however there is little knowledge about seasonal variations in contact rates among arctic foxes simon et al 2020 in addition the main ecological drivers of large scale movements of arctic foxes are still unclear and more research is needed to identify them lai et al 2017 ideally denning sites for arctic foxes in inland lemming habitats should be targeted for future rabies control interventions using orv during the fall season before foxes potentially disperse or migrate to resource hotspots across sea ice the location of denning sites seems predictable as arctic foxes select preferentially south facing mounds or steep slopes sandy substrate and streamside cutbanks to excavate their dens szor et al 2008 however to date orv planning is challenging due to the difficulty to find active dens with fox presence in high arctic regions predicted probability maps of den site selection e g crupi et al 2020 davies et al 2016 would be useful for identifying sites with a high probability of fox den presence and supporting orv planning our abm describes density dependent transmission of an infectious pathogen within a single host species however arctic rabies can be maintained by a secondary reservoir species the red fox vulpes vulpes which has expanded its range into habitats occupied by the arctic fox elmhagen et al 2017 simon et al 2019 this range expansion can be attributed to an increase in food resources resulting from climate warming and increased human activities in the north elmhagen et al 2017 gallant et al 2020 hersteinsson and macdonald 1992 red foxes and arctic foxes compete for food and shelters which can lead to interference competition through aggression and predation by the red fox elmhagen et al 2002 pamperin et al 2006 rodnikova et al 2011 and thus increase the risk of rabies virus transmission between the two species our abm could be extended by incorporating multiple species and real landscapes to achieve a better understanding of the consequences of environmental changes on spread and transmission dynamics of rabies in the arctic the application of the abm to such a more complex system will be an important next step in this line of research data accessibility the argos data are

24263,invasive species pose a major threat to native species both through direct interactions such as competition for resources and indirect interactions such as when the invasive species acts as a reservoir host for a virulent pathogen recent research has indicated that the recovery of native predators can benefit native prey species that compete with invasive prey in circumstances where predation is more pronounced on the naïve invasive species we use the native red squirrel sciurus vulgaris invasive grey squirrel sciurus carolinensis and shared squirrelpox virus sqpv system in north wales uk as a case study system to assess the impact of a recovering native predator of both squirrel species the pine marten martes martes on community structure we develop a stochastic spatial model that represents the habitat structure distribution and connectivity in north wales and models the interactions of red and grey squirrels sqpv and pine marten to examine the indirect effect of native predator recovery on competitively linked native invasive prey species and a viral pathogen our model demonstrates the potential role of native predators in reversing the replacement of a threatened native prey through the regulation of the invasive prey species due to sustained predation and the resultant extirpation of a viral pathogen which otherwise catalyses the replacement of the native red squirrel by the invasive grey squirrel our findings have system specific applied conservation implications but moreover demonstrate the critical role of native predators in mitigating the impacts of invasive species and indirectly the infectious diseases they harbour keywords pine marten predation red grey squirrels north wales suppression of invasive species suppression of pathogen mathematical model data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the introduction of and invasion by non native species is recognised as a major threat to native species persistence and biodiversity simberloff 2011 bellard et al 2016 seebens et al 2017 replacement of native species can occur as a result of direct interactions such as through predation and interspecific competition for resources as well as through indirect effects such as when the invasive species acts as a reservoir host for a virulent pathogen of the native species bellard et al 2016 strauss et al 2012 the impact of introduced non native species and their pathogens on the population dynamics of native species communities has uncovered the importance of both direct and indirect interactions across trophic levels in driving system outcomes tompkins et al 2003 hilker and schmitz 2008 roberts and heesterbeek 2021 pathogens and predators are key elements in many different systems with their impact dependent on community configuration hatcher et al 2006 lafferty 2004 ritchie and johnson 2009 cortez and duffy 2020 competitively linked prey species can share both predators and pathogens meaning the presence and impact on one host prey species cannot be determined without understanding the indirect interactions that arise due to the presence of a different predator pathogen or prey species holt and bonsall 2017 for example declines in populations of the native water vole arvicola terrestris in the united kingdom have been demonstrated to be driven indirectly through apparent competition with an invasive competitor european rabbit oryctolagus cuniculus which serves as the staple prey item of their shared invasive predator american mink neovison vison oliver et al 2009 knowledge of the impacts of indirect effects between predators and competitors is growing however a key challenge remains in comprehending the effects of the combined indirect interactions between both predators and pathogens on prey the eurasian red squirrel sciurus vulgaris which is native to great britain and ireland is threatened by the introduced invasive north american grey squirrel sciurus carolinensis the red squirrel has become extinct in large parts of great britain and ireland and it is estimated that just over 80 of the remaining populations in great britain are in scotland with the rest found in isolated forests or offshore islands in england and wales mathews et al 2018 the decline of red squirrel populations has arisen due to the spread of and disease mediated competition with the north american grey squirrel which since its introduction at the turn of the 20th century has replaced red squirrels throughout most of england and wales and parts of scotland and ireland middleton 1930 white et al 2016 the competitive interactions between the two species can lead to increased stress in red squirrels reduced body size and fecundity as well as measurable reductions in local juvenile red squirrel recruitment rates wauters et al 2002 gurnell et al 2004 bertolino et al 2014 santicchia et al 2018 grey squirrels are a reservoir host of squirrelpox virus sqpv that is asymptomatic and endemic in grey squirrels but fatal to red squirrels chantrey et al 2014 the replacement of red squirrels has been reported to occur up to twenty five times faster in areas where sqpv is present tompkins et al 2003 rushton et al 2006 recent research has indicated that the recovery of native predators can benefit native prey species that compete with invasive prey in circumstances where predation is more pronounced on the naïve invasive species sheehy and lawton 2014 twining et al 2022b pine martens martes martes are generalist semi arboreal predators native to great britain and ireland that have been reported to prey upon grey squirrels at a greater frequency compared to red squirrels twining et al 2020c which is believed to occur due to evolutionary naïvety and a lack of anti predator behaviours in grey squirrels twining et al 2020a recent legal protection has led to the on going recovery of pine marten that has led to the recolonisation of much of their historical range in scotland and ireland this recovery has resulted in landscape scale declines of established grey squirrel populations that has allowed the re establishment of red squirrels in regions where they have previously been excluded sheehy and lawton 2014 twining et al 2022b 2020c sheehy et al 2018 bamber et al 2020 there remains a paucity of information on the impact of pine marten recovery on the prevalence of sqpv in squirrel populations but see roberts and heesterbeek 2021 current red squirrel conservation efforts aim to mitigate the impacts of grey squirrels on red squirrels gill et al 2019 schuchert et al 2014 saving scotland s red squirrels 2019 scotland 2012 they include targeted squirrel control to remove or reduce the density of established populations of grey squirrels gill et al 2019 schuchert et al 2014 to prevent further grey squirrel range expansion and reduce disease transmission white et al 2016 saving scotland s red squirrels 2019 conservation efforts also include the designation and management of stronghold forests that are intended to provide refuge for red squirrels against the incursion of grey squirrels scotland 2012 slade et al 2020 in wales like elsewhere the arrival and range expansion of grey squirrels led to widespread replacement of red squirrels mathews et al 2018 efforts to re introduce red squirrels have included translocations with releases occurring on anglesey an island off the north coast of wales see fig 1 after a programme of grey squirrel eradication monitoring and grey squirrel control guided by mathematical modelling is used to protect the re established red squirrel populations in wales jones et al 2017 red squirrels have also maintained a limited presence via the use of population reinforcement in an attempt to prevent extinction in a 5 000 hectare upland commercial conifer plantation in central north wales previous pine marten reinforcement translocations whereby 51 pine marten were captured in scotland and released into mid wales between 2015 and 2017 vincent wildlife trust unpub data sainsbury et al 2019 has resulted in regional population establishment in mid wales whilst a programme to release pine marten into north wales near the coastal city of bangor see fig 1 has recently begun the reinforcement of pine marten populations in wales could act to reduce sqpv prevalence and grey squirrel density and potentially lead to the predator mediated recovery of red squirrels mathematical models have successfully been used to elucidate the mechanisms that underpin red squirrel replacement highlighting that disease mediated competition from grey squirrels and predation by shared predators are key factors tompkins et al 2003 roberts and heesterbeek 2021 they have been adapted to inform conservation strategies to protect red squirrels suggesting that grey squirrel control which has been empirically shown to reduce sqpv prevalence schuchert et al 2014 may be insufficient to prevent the spatial spread of sqpv white et al 2016 furthermore models have been used to outline control strategies that can result in local grey squirrel extinction and prevent the re invasion of grey squirrels into red squirrel strongholds jones et al 2017 croft et al 2021 in this paper we extend established spatial modelling approaches that represent the interactions of red and grey squirrels and sqpv in realistic landscapes white et al 2016 jones et al 2017 to include the dynamics of pine marten and examine the indirect effect of pine marten predation on red and grey squirrel interactions and the prevalence and persistence of a viral pathogen sqpv in the prey populations the model system will incorporate habitat information from land cover datasets for north wales and will therefore be representative of realistic landscapes see fig 1 using the model we will examine the potential spread of pine marten from populations in mid wales as well as from populations introduced into north wales our aim will be to assess the likely impact of pine marten predation on red and grey squirrel abundance and the prevalence and persistence of sqpv in north wales while we recognise that model results are at best an approximation of reality they allow key scenarios to be tested and compared and can provide a starting point for wider scientific debate and further studies specifically the model results presented in this study will provide a key platform for informing applied conservation practice in great britain and ireland including guiding the decision to support the translocation of pine marten into north wales furthermore the findings from the model system are also applicable in general highlighting how the recovery of native predators may act to control invasive species and indirectly the infectious diseases they harbour 2 materials and methods 2 1 model framework the mathematical model adapts previous models of the red and grey squirrel system which used classical deterministic approaches tompkins et al 2003 to develop a spatial stochastic model in realistic landscapes white et al 2016 jones et al 2017 to include pine marten population dynamics the model simulates the demographics of red squirrels grey squirrels pine marten and sqpv infection along with intra and inter specific competition between squirrels and predation from pine marten on squirrels the model runs on an array of 1 km by 1 km grid squares linked by dispersal to approximate the real heterogeneous landscape of north wales the model uses land cover data in conjunction with carrying capacity estimates associated with specific tree species to estimate species carrying capacities in each grid square the deterministic model for the system upon which the stochastic model is based highlights the key population processes that we consider the deterministic system represents the population density and infection status with regard to sqpv for susceptible s r and infected i r red squirrels susceptible s g infected i g and recovered r g grey squirrels as well as the density of pine marten p the model is as follows 1 d s g d t a g t b s g β s g i g i r μ g s g p d i g d t β s g i g i r b i g γ i g μ g i

t a p b p p p p c c 1 k m 0 p p c c 1 k m the model framework that we use to represent the dynamics of red and grey squirrels and sqpv has been used in previous studies and yields results that are a good match with empirical data see white et al 2016 jones et al 2017 here a g t represents the periodic birth rate of grey squirrels which assumes births occur for only half of the year between march and september each year representing observed peak litter periods and periods with no breeding activity the term for a r t is equivalent to a g t with the subscripts for r and g interchanged note h r s r i r and h g s g i g r g represent the total populations for red and grey squirrels respectively the natural rate of adult mortality b 0 9 barkalow jr et al 1970 is assumed to be the same for both red and grey squirrels but the rates of maximum reproduction differ with red squirrel birth rate a r 3 and grey squirrel birth rate a g 3 4 tompkins et al 2003 the competitive effect of grey squirrels on red squirrels is denoted by c g 1 65 whilst that of red squirrels on grey squirrels is denoted by c r 0 61 highlighting the asymmetry in competitive outcome bryce et al 2002 sqpv is transmitted both within and between each squirrel species in a density dependent manner with transmission coefficient β 0 83 see section 2 3 below infected red squirrels die due to the disease at rate α 26 and infected greys recover at rate γ 13 tompkins et al 2003 the susceptibilities to crowding q r q g which are specific to each grid square are set to ensure the average density over one year is equal to the estimated carrying capacity in each grid square for that year with the carrying capacity being defined using tree species information that is given in table 2 see also section 2 2 below pine marten are generalist omnivores whose density is also driven by resource limitation pine martens like most mustelids display intra sexual territoriality with resident animals of the same sex having non overlapping stable home ranges o mahony 2014 birks 2020 consequently we assume pine marten density p can reach its local maximum value in any 1 km grid square which we denote p c c 1 k m with the carrying capacity of that square being dependent solely on habitat see table 2 thus we assume that as generalists pine marten density is not dependent on local squirrel availability for the pine marten birth rate we assume an average lifespan of 5 years with sexual maturity occurring after 2 years we assume a 50 50 sex ratio with an average annual litter size which ranges between 1 and 5 kits per litter of 2 birks 2020 this leads to 0 6 new borns per year per individual which translates into an annual birth rate of 0 47 we assume a 6 month breeding season and therefore the births occur at a constant rate a p 0 94 for 6 months and a p 0 for the rest of the year for the death rate we use the inverse of the average life span which yields a constant annual death rate due to all possible factors of b p 0 2 the predation rate of pine marten on grey squirrels μ g is defined such that a pine marten density of 0 36 km 2 will cause a 30 drop in grey squirrel density a conservative estimate given empirical evidence that grey squirrels can be eradicated by pine marten at densities that are found in scotland and ireland twining et al 2022b 2020c sheehy et al 2018 which gives a value of μ g 1 5 given the uncertainty in this value the predation rate will be altered with a lower value of μ g 0 75 and a high value of μ g 2 25 to explore the impact of the predation rate on the squirrel dynamics the average frequency of occurrence of red squirrels in pine marten diet 2 5 sheehy and lawton 2014 3 7 twining et al 2020c has been reported to be lower than that of grey squirrels 15 6 sheehy and lawton 2014 twining et al 2020c and therefore we set μ r 0 2 μ g to reflect the higher occurrence of grey squirrels in pine marten diet whilst we recognise that frequency of occurrence does not directly imply differences in predation rates we believe that the dietary data which is taken from a wide and representative sample that includes both allopatric and sympatric populations of red and grey squirrels at various densities is a suitable proxy for the difference in predation given the lack of quantitative data on the functional response of the pine marten to these two prey species predation is assumed to be unaffected by squirrel infection status all parameter values assume an annual time scale to generate the stochastic model table 1 the rates in the deterministic model are converted into probabilities of events that account for changes in individual grid square level abundance renshaw 1993 we also add squirrel and pine marten dispersal in the stochastic model to represent movement between grid squares for both squirrel species the model assumes density dependent dispersal such that squirrel dispersal increases as density increases see jones et al 2016 and table 1 legend for more details pine marten dispersal occurs on a 5 km by 5 km gridded scale which has a defined habitat dependent carrying capacity p c c that is the sum of the carrying capacities of the 25 1 km grid squares that are contained within the 5 km region see section 2 2 when the pine marten population exceeds p c c the excess individuals are assumed to disperse into one of the 8 neighbouring 5 km by 5 km regions if the pine marten density in the chosen destination region is at or above p c c the dispersing pine marten are assumed to die and are thus removed this ensures pine marten do not disperse continuously when densities are high across the landscape in addition to local dispersal we assume rare long distance dispersal that can occur at any time with dispersal rate d p 0 05 which was chosen to fit the pine marten expansion rate that has been observed in northern ireland j twining unpub data see also twining et al 2022b during the long range dispersal event pine marten can disperse to any grid square chosen at random within a 50 km radius this reflects observations in which tracked individuals who were previously released into mid wales have been recorded over 103 km away from the point of release after approximately 6 months mcnicol et al 2020 in the model we assume all grid squares outside the study area have zero carrying capacity consequently neither squirrel nor pine marten can disperse into these grid squares in the model anglesey and mainland wales are considered as different gridded maps with the transition between these maps being governed by a single grid square that is designated as the britannia bridge which represents the primary expansion route for grey squirrels onto anglesey movement between anglesey and the mainland requires squirrels martens to disperse via the grid square designated as the britannia bridge this ensures that the 5 km by 5 km pine marten regions do not overlap both anglesey and the mainland 2 2 carrying capacities to estimate plausible carrying capacities for each grid square we use the national forest inventory woodland wales 2018 dataset which includes information on whether the primary tree species in a given area is broadleaf or conifer the urban wales 2015 dataset which outlines the urban habitat as well as a major rivers dataset which locates the main rivers in wales to create a map detailing the proportion of each habitat type in a 1 km by 1 km grid square this information can be used in conjunction with fixed estimates of squirrel and pine marten density values for broadleaf and conifer habitat table 2 to generate carrying capacity estimates for each species for each 1 km grid square in the model see figure s1 in the supp info for carrying capacity maps we use constant estimates of pine marten and squirrel carrying capacity thereby ignoring factors such as seasonal variation and seed crop cycles that are inherent in the real system croft et al 2021 croft et al 2021 suggest this is appropriate for mixed species woodland where asynchrony in tree species masting maintains a more stable food resource and consequently reduces amplitude in squirrel density variation than would be expected in woodland with lower tree diversity this also allows us to compare different model scenarios without the added complication that variation in resources would impose on the dynamics the grid square level pine marten carrying capacity values are used to create the 5 km by 5 km carrying capacity values that in turn are used to trigger pine marten dispersal the broadleaf conifer and urban squirrel capacity values are the medium values from the anglesey study conducted by jones et al 2016 however in line with recent studies for scotland slade et al 2020 twining et al 2020c we assume red squirrels have a competitive advantage over grey squirrels in purely coniferous habitat mixed mainly broadleaf carrying capacity consists of 65 broadleaf capacity 35 conifer carrying capacity whilst mixed mainly conifer is 65 conifer capacity 35 broadleaf capacity the carrying capacity values for scrub have been set at a low value to indicate that whilst neither squirrels nor pine marten would reside in this habitat they will utilise it and move through it to reach other habitats jones et al 2016 caryl et al 2012 twining et al 2020b open land is any region that does not have a named feature the small pine marten carrying capacity associated with open land indicates that whilst pine marten cannot reside in these regions they can cross these areas and reach available habitat beyond them the britannia bridge is the only available dispersal route between the island of anglesey and mainland wales this grid square has been given the same carrying capacity as the urban regions to allow free movement of squirrels and pine marten all carrying capacity values can be found in table 2 2 3 initial conditions currently red squirrels are resident in an upland conifer plantation in central north wales and on the island of anglesey with some red squirrels dispersing from anglesey across the britannia bridge into the region surrounding the city of bangor see fig 1 grey squirrels are established across the entirety of north wales except the island of anglesey given the absence of detailed density data we assumed grey squirrels are not present in the conifer plantation thus the model results will simulate the replacement of red squirrels due to dispersal from nearby known grey squirrel populations the squirrel initial conditions in the model therefore assume that red squirrels are at their carrying capacity in the regions where they are sole residents red and grey squirrels are at half their carrying capacity in the area around the city of bangor where they both reside and grey squirrels are at their carrying capacity in all other regions of north wales as indicated in figure s2 in the supp info in the model we consider two scenarios for pine marten initial conditions the first assumes that pine marten resident in mid wales migrate north with the initial population located in suitable habitat in mid wales which is the southern edge of our study region set at a quarter of the carrying capacity figure s3 a the second initial condition assumes the potential release of 20 pine marten 10 pine marten released in consecutive years at the start of the model simulation into the area surrounding the city of bangor figure s3 c in addition to dispersal from mid wales the release site at bangor is chosen as there have been recent releases of pine marten into the area surrounding the city with the aim of conserving red squirrels on the island of anglesey results where pine marten have been released into the region surrounding bangor only figure s3 b as well as a long term scenario whereby pine marten have colonised the entirety of wales figure s3 d are included in the supplementary information to generate the sqpv initial conditions the model was simulated for 10 years with only grey squirrels present the value of β 0 83 was used as this leads to a seroprevalence of 74 in grey squirrels schuchert et al 2014 sainsbury et al 2000 in a homogeneous population of 80 individuals in a 1 km by 1 km grid square which is representative of grey squirrel density per km 2 in regions in north wales where sqpv has been reported schuchert et al 2014 sainsbury et al 2000 the initial condition of sqpv shown in figure s4 in the supp info indicates that the model predicts variability in the prevalence of sqpv which is strongly linked to grey squirrel density across north wales 2 4 model realisations each model realisation follows a gillespie algorithm gillespie 1977 here the time between events is an exponentially distributed random variable that can be determined as t e v e n t ln σ r where σ is a random number drawn from a uniform distribution between zero and one and r is the sum of the event rates as defined in table 1 see also renshaw 1993 the event see table 1 which occurs at each time step is also chosen at random based on the relative event rates with changes in density and the associated probabilities updated after each event we run each realisation for 40 model years and run 10 realisations of the stochastic model for each scenario that we test 3 results 3 1 pine marten migration from mid wales there is little expansion in pine marten range during the first 10 years of simulation as it takes time for pine marten abundance to increase to levels that trigger local dispersal fig 2 thereafter local and rare long distance dispersal leads to pine marten range expansion into north wales and subsequent increases in density within 30 years such wide scale and rapid expansion matches real world scenarios and has for example been observed in northern ireland twining et al 2022b as shown in fig 2 the model suggests that pine marten expansion into north wales will take time thus allowing grey squirrels the opportunity to out compete and replace red squirrels in north west wales which could lead to the re colonisation of the island of anglesey as would be the case if grey squirrel control efforts were stopped jones et al 2016 fig 3 pine martens fail to establish at high density on the island anglesey by the end of the 40 year model simulation likely due to a lack of suitable habitat on the island as well as a lack of connectivity between the island and the mainland consequently grey squirrels continue to expand and replace red squirrels on the island a comparison between fig 3 and results showing red and grey squirrel occupancy in the absence of pine marten figure s5 in the supp info indicate that red squirrel replacement on the island of anglesey is predicted to be reduced when pine marten are present the presence of pine marten leads to the reduction of grey squirrel density fig 4 particularly from year 30 of the simulation onwards which coincides with the increase in pine marten density that occurs following dispersal fig 2 the suppression of grey squirrel density due to pine marten presence allows red squirrels resident in large conifer plantations to expand their range into neighbouring forests where they previously were excluded this occurs for all three rates of pine marten predation with the expansion of the red occupied region increasing with increasing predation rate the higher predation rates also lead to a removal of grey squirrels from regions where there is not a concurrent increase in red squirrel occupancy due to the lack of adjacent red squirrel populations fig 4 b c 3 2 pine marten reinforcement in north wales and migration from mid wales the combined effect of pine marten release into both north and mid wales is that pine marten range expansion is predicted to be more rapid as the time frame for the northern populations of pine marten to reach their carrying capacity is reduced fig 5 in particular the range expansion of pine marten across the north coast and south from these populations is now pronounced compare figs 2 e and 5 e where pine marten establish and recover to sufficient density they reduce grey squirrel density fig 7 pine marten populations in the north west of wales and later on the island of anglesey reduce the impact of grey squirrel expansion onto anglesey therefore the model system predicts that the pine marten release into north wales as opposed to the migrating pine marten from mid wales is potentially key to safeguarding the red squirrel population in north wales and on the island of anglesey especially for medium and high predation rates fig 6 b c the release of pine marten into north wales is also predicted to support an increase in red squirrel expansion from the resident population in the large conifer plantation and at high predations rates to facilitate the establishment of red squirrel populations into regions where they are excluded when pine marten migrate from mid wales alone 3 3 the impact of pine marten on sqpv sqpv is currently endemic in the grey squirrel populations of north wales fig 8 outlines the predicted impact of pine marten predation on sqpv for the scenario where pine marten have been introduced into north wales as well as migrated from mid wales as pine marten expand their range and increase in density fig 5 predation of grey squirrels reduces the grey squirrel density fig 7 to levels that cannot support sqpv fig 8 higher predation rates lead to greater more rapid reductions in sqpv prevalence the model predicts that sqpv will be eradicated from north west wales and from the island of anglesey after 10 years after 20 years of model simulation there emerges two distinct regions where sqpv remains endemic one region stretches from the north coast to the west coast whilst the other region is in the north east of north wales adjacent to the border between england and wales sqpv is largely absent from the conifer plantation by year 20 in the model and by year 30 of the model simulation the majority of north wales is predicted to be sqpv free sqpv is largely eradicated under all three predation rate scenarios by year 40 of the simulation notice that extinction of sqpv does not require the extinction of grey squirrels compare figs 7 and 8 but instead requires that grey squirrel density is reduced below a threshold value pine marten predation could therefore have an additional ecosystem benefit in terms of disease management even when predation does not lead to species eradication 3 4 alternative model scenarios we undertook a model scenario in which pine marten were released into north wales only with no expansion from mid wales the results are shown in the supplementary information figures s6 s7 the results are similar to those in fig 6 although the potential red squirrel range expansion into mid wales is more rapid when pine marten dispersal also occurred from mid wales nevertheless this indicates that the release of pine marten into north wales could be key to safeguarding the red squirrel population on the island of anglesey and to supporting the range expansion of red squirrels across north wales we also tested different pine marten release strategies in north wales our default of 10 individuals in two consecutive years or 20 individuals in one year or 5 individuals in four consecutive years but this had a minimal impact on the results we also considered a scenario where pine marten have been introduced at their carrying capacity into all suitable regions of north wales to simulate the long term impact of pine marten on red and grey squirrel interactions figures s8 s9 s10 at the low predation rate of μ g 0 75 the impact of pine marten predation is predicted to be sufficient to safeguard the red squirrel population resident in the conifer plantation and support moderate expansion of the red squirrel range to the south of the plantation however low levels of predation cannot prevent the expansion of grey squirrels onto the island of anglesey at medium and high predation rates the higher frequency of predation by pine marten on grey squirrels protects red squirrels on anglesey and the model suggests that the majority of central north wales could be viable for red squirrel occupation model results indicate that grey squirrels will still dominate the border region between england and wales the eastern border of our study region as well as the western peninsula ll y ˆ n peninsula due to the fragmented habitat which provides limited access routes into the peninsula from the rest of north wales the results presented here are averages of the ten model realisations that were generated using the stochastic model the results should not be viewed as definitive predictions of pine marten and squirrel population dynamics in particular the initial pine marten dispersal can vary due to the assumed random nature of the long distance dispersal this variability results in different initial patterns of pine marten dispersal in different model realisations and these variations can have a greater or lesser impact on squirrel interactions dependent on the distance between pine marten and squirrel populations this can subsequently impact the timing of certain squirrel events such as the transition onto anglesey by grey squirrels similarly given the competitive interactions that occur at the boundary between red and grey squirrel populations the variation at these sites is naturally higher than in single species regions where competition between species does not occur nevertheless in the long term pine marten become established across the entirety of the study region in all realisations and so their impact on squirrels becomes consistent 4 discussion in this study we provide theoretical evidence through empirically devised mathematical modelling of the impacts of the recovery of a native predator on the densities of two competitively linked prey species along with the prevalence of a virulent pathogen that mediates the replacement of the native species by the invasive competitor in the absence of pine marten sqpv led to the loss of around 80 of the red squirrel mainland population in an area of north west wales in 2020 21 shuttleworth et al 2022 however the model findings indicate that the recovery of the pine marten could result in the eradication of sqpv from the landscape thus reducing the threat of replacement of red squirrels by the invasive grey squirrel we demonstrate a viable mechanism for this which occurs through the predation and regulation of the host reservoir below the threshold for pathogen persistence results from the spatially explicit mathematical model developed here indicate that pine marten recovery will benefit native red squirrels in wales reversing the typical outcome of disease mediated competition between the two prey species the model indicates that empirically supported higher predation by the native predator of grey squirrels compared to red squirrels could safeguard current red squirrel populations and allow red squirrels to expand their range in north wales as has been observed in both scotland and ireland thus the model results demonstrate that the potential impacts of native predator recovery on native prey are multi faceted occurring through several linked indirect pathways through the predation of an invasive competitor and the subsequent suppression and extirpation of a virulent pathogen that is a key factor in species replacement in consensus with real world empirical data from other ecosystems twining et al 2022b 2020c sheehy et al 2018 this modelling study indicates that the population recovery of pine marten can lead to reductions in grey squirrel density or extirpation of grey squirrels and the recovery and range expansion of red squirrels on a landscape scale the key mechanism that underpins this result is that pine marten prey upon grey squirrels at a higher frequency than red squirrels which has been observed in the field sheehy and lawton 2014 twining et al 2020c prey regulation and persistence is sensitive to the force of predation which can occur at the individual level through a predator s functional response holling 1959 or at the population level through predator aggregation solomon 1949 we see this in our model with the combination of the predation coefficient and predator density driving grey squirrel extirpation while the predation coefficient is difficult to estimate observations of the extirpation of grey squirrels following pine marten establishment twining et al 2022b 2020c sheehy et al 2018 offers support that the model results shown for medium and high predation rates are reflective of the real system the model also suggests that grey squirrel extirpation could occur more rapidly in regions where pine marten recovery is adjacent to source populations of red squirrels for example grey extirpation is pronounced in large areas of coniferous forest where predation combines with inter specific competition from red squirrels roberts and heesterbeek 2021 slade et al 2022 in general the model results concur with findings from field and observational studies in northern ireland and scotland that indicate that pine marten can reverse the typical competitive outcome between red and greys squirrels in forest habitats twining et al 2022b 2020c sheehy et al 2018 we acknowledge that model studies are abstractions of the real systems and should not be used as definitive predictive tools particularly due to the difficulty inherent in assigning constant values to variable quantities such as predation rates and carrying capacities however model studies can be used to understand the qualitative dynamics elucidate critical mechanisms and predict potential outcomes of complex species interactions the model study here suggests that the range expansion and increase in density of pine marten in the uk could have significant benefits for the conservation of red squirrels that are threatened by grey squirrels both through lowering the density of the invasive competitor and reducing the prevalence of disease sqpv in this example pine marten are generalist predators and so will prey upon both red and grey squirrels twining et al 2020c halliwell 1997 as well as other native species and therefore pine marten recovery could threaten red squirrel viability where populations are fragmented or in habitats such as commercial conifer plantations that support low abundance of alternate prey species twining et al 2022b our model study assumes pine marten predation rates that are constant across all habitat types model results suggest that for pine marten densities that are in line with those from field observations from great britain and ireland twining et al 2022b 2020c sheehy et al 2018 increasing levels of predation in the absence of grey squirrels will reduce red squirrel population density however the model results suggest red squirrels can persist in the presence of pine marten predation in all habitat types albeit at low densities in conifer dominated habitat including when pine marten have recovered to carrying capacity levels see figure s8 red squirrels have been observed to persist at significantly lower densities where they co occur with pine marten in scotland halliwell 1997 additionally empirical evidence from landscape scale monitoring and multi species occupancy modelling demonstrated a positive influence of pine marten recovery on red squirrel occurrence at a landscape scale this is especially evident in broadleaf habitats where pine marten allow red squirrels to recover following the local extirpation of grey squirrels twining et al 2022b 2020c even though pine martens reduce the occurrence of red squirrels in areas dominated by conifer plantations in northern ireland twining et al 2022b these differences may highlight an unrealistic assumption in our model with habitat mediation of the interactions between native predator and prey being likely linked to the seasonal abundance or lack of alternate resources resulting in potentially increased predation pressure at certain times in some habitats twining et al 2022b the threat to red squirrels in conifer plantations may be reduced in great britain where the presence of numerically dominant field voles microtus agrestis results in distinct dietary differences between ireland and great britain field voles which are often a key prey item in diet studies in great britain e g caryl et al 2012 undergo inter annual cycles in abundance whilst pine marten diet during nadirs in these cycles appear relatively similar caryl et al 2012 twining et al 2019 theoretical modelling suggests that peaks in vole population cycles may provide temporal refuges for both squirrel species thus mediating the impacts of pine marten recovery on both species slade et al 2022 whilst these hypotheses remains empirically unvalidated we can draw inference from the better studied invasive species despite the presence of field voles in scotland and their potential to diffuse the population impacts of pine marten recovery on both prey species slade et al 2022 a quantitative investigation in scotland has demonstrated that even low density marten populations depress the occurrence of invasive grey squirrels with local extirpation of grey squirrels predicted sheehy et al 2018 the ubiquity of the impacts of pine marten recovery on grey squirrels across both systems both in the presence and absence of field voles scotland and ireland respectively raises expectations for similarity in the impacts on red squirrels between the two systems given the potential risk to red squirrel viability in conifer dominated habitats there is a need for more research on the relative impacts of pine martens on red squirrels in different contexts and ecological communities prey species may harbour infectious pathogens which can persist at endemic levels if for instance prey density exceeds a threshold that can support the pathogen lloyd smith et al 2005 the population recovery of predators can result in the regulation of prey populations when predation occurs across a range of observed prey densities turchin 1995 we considered a variety of different sustained predation rates on prey host populations and the threshold for disease persistence and we demonstrate the capacity for native predators to have significant impacts on pathogen prevalence and persistence in certain scenarios moore et al 2010 in our study system grey squirrels are a reservoir for sqpv that has little effect on grey squirrel health but leads to a deleterious infection in red squirrels and has been demonstrated as a key driver of species replacement in great britain and ireland tompkins et al 2002 our model results indicate that pine marten predation could be sufficient to reduce grey squirrel density to levels that cannot support endemic sqpv the reduced risk of transmission of sqpv from grey squirrels to neighbouring re establishing red squirrels would prevent the potential crash of local red squirrel populations due to a sqpv epidemic outbreak chantrey et al 2014 white and lurz 2014 shuttleworth et al 2022 the model results therefore provide a key example of how the recovery and re establishment of native predators can have an impact on both invasive species and pathogen persistence this provides additional support to recent work suggesting that increased predator diversity and density can reduce parasite transmission thereby highlighting the importance of predator communities for disease dynamics and ecosystem stability rohr et al 2015 although theory typically envisages predators suppressing disease as we predict here there is also striking evidence of predators increasing the chance of a disease outbreak strauss et al 2016 a key mechanism in determining potential predator effects on disease has been suggested to be the coupling of predator prey population dynamics and the selectivity of predation duffy and hall 2008 if pathogen infected individuals are more vulnerable to predation dick et al 2010 tanner et al 2019 predators may dramatically reduce disease in host populations however the opposite can also be true if susceptible individuals are more prone to predation then predation could increase disease prevalence in a population hatcher and dunn 2011 in the absence of empirical data on the selectivity of predation in the model system we assumed equal predation of infected and susceptible individuals and with this estimate for the selectivity of predation predators still suppress the infection thus we observe that the potential of predators to positively or negatively impact disease are not equal and we demonstrate that it is more likely that predators will reduce disease as only in special contexts e g when infected prey become much less susceptible to predation which is likely a rare occurrence that predation will have the potential to increase disease prevalence our model results predict that it will take approximately 5 10 years for pine marten density to increase to levels that are sufficient to provide a source for local dispersal with limited long distance dispersal occurring during this period thereafter local and rare long range dispersal of pine marten provides new source populations which leads to further more rapid range expansion such that north wales is largely occupied by pine marten after approximately 25 30 years this is likely to be a conservative estimate with recolonisation of all 32 counties in ireland without additional reinforcement occurring within a shorter time frame carey et al 2007 lawton et al 2015 2020 twining et al 2022a when the natural expansion of pine marten from populations in mid wales in the south of our study region is supplemented by the targeted release of pine marten into north wales the range expansion of pine marten is more rapid our model results therefore lend support to the use of translocated and captive bred founders to increase the rate of recovery and dispersal and genetic variability of native predator populations that can form part of the conservation approach to reduce the impact of invasive species bamber et al 2020 our model findings provide key information such as the creation of a scenario framework and the identification of uncertainties on the potential impact of pine marten re introductions in north wales the findings have been used to support pine marten translocations in north wales which will contribute to the delivery of the regional squirrel management strategy pine marten recovery has the potential to contribute to grey squirrel decline assuming for example that changes in grey squirrel behaviour or some adaptive response to predator presence does not act to reduce the proportionally higher predation of grey squirrels compared to red squirrels then pine marten recovery potentially offers a long term sustainable mechanism that could reverse the fortunes of the red squirrel it is recognised that monitoring and where necessary coordinated grey squirrel control i e via trapping or shooting must continue the parallel detection and removal of animals that disperse onto the island of anglesey will also need to be maintained in these periods shuttleworth et al 2020 progressively therefore such interventions may become even more targeted e g at localised grey squirrel populations inhabiting key habitats where pine marten density may be low or their presence ephemeral or infrequent such as urban parkland for example this type of integrated conservation management offers a dynamic and cost effective landscape scale approach to predator mediated control of invasive species dunn and marzano 2015 5 conclusion in this study we demonstrate the potential role native predators may have in reversing the replacement of a threatened native prey species by an established invasive species our model highlights a potential mechanism regulation of the invasive prey species through sustained predation over a range of densities and the resultant extirpation of a viral pathogen which otherwise catalyses the replacement of the native species by the invasive species this body of research has not only key system specific applied implications to inform future conservation policy and management strategy but also demonstrates the critical role of native predators in mitigating the impacts of disease and invasive species as well as supporting ecosystem stability credit authorship contribution statement andrew slade conceptualization methodology

24263,invasive species pose a major threat to native species both through direct interactions such as competition for resources and indirect interactions such as when the invasive species acts as a reservoir host for a virulent pathogen recent research has indicated that the recovery of native predators can benefit native prey species that compete with invasive prey in circumstances where predation is more pronounced on the naïve invasive species we use the native red squirrel sciurus vulgaris invasive grey squirrel sciurus carolinensis and shared squirrelpox virus sqpv system in north wales uk as a case study system to assess the impact of a recovering native predator of both squirrel species the pine marten martes martes on community structure we develop a stochastic spatial model that represents the habitat structure distribution and connectivity in north wales and models the interactions of red and grey squirrels sqpv and pine marten to examine the indirect effect of native predator recovery on competitively linked native invasive prey species and a viral pathogen our model demonstrates the potential role of native predators in reversing the replacement of a threatened native prey through the regulation of the invasive prey species due to sustained predation and the resultant extirpation of a viral pathogen which otherwise catalyses the replacement of the native red squirrel by the invasive grey squirrel our findings have system specific applied conservation implications but moreover demonstrate the critical role of native predators in mitigating the impacts of invasive species and indirectly the infectious diseases they harbour keywords pine marten predation red grey squirrels north wales suppression of invasive species suppression of pathogen mathematical model data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the introduction of and invasion by non native species is recognised as a major threat to native species persistence and biodiversity simberloff 2011 bellard et al 2016 seebens et al 2017 replacement of native species can occur as a result of direct interactions such as through predation and interspecific competition for resources as well as through indirect effects such as when the invasive species acts as a reservoir host for a virulent pathogen of the native species bellard et al 2016 strauss et al 2012 the impact of introduced non native species and their pathogens on the population dynamics of native species communities has uncovered the importance of both direct and indirect interactions across trophic levels in driving system outcomes tompkins et al 2003 hilker and schmitz 2008 roberts and heesterbeek 2021 pathogens and predators are key elements in many different systems with their impact dependent on community configuration hatcher et al 2006 lafferty 2004 ritchie and johnson 2009 cortez and duffy 2020 competitively linked prey species can share both predators and pathogens meaning the presence and impact on one host prey species cannot be determined without understanding the indirect interactions that arise due to the presence of a different predator pathogen or prey species holt and bonsall 2017 for example declines in populations of the native water vole arvicola terrestris in the united kingdom have been demonstrated to be driven indirectly through apparent competition with an invasive competitor european rabbit oryctolagus cuniculus which serves as the staple prey item of their shared invasive predator american mink neovison vison oliver et al 2009 knowledge of the impacts of indirect effects between predators and competitors is growing however a key challenge remains in comprehending the effects of the combined indirect interactions between both predators and pathogens on prey the eurasian red squirrel sciurus vulgaris which is native to great britain and ireland is threatened by the introduced invasive north american grey squirrel sciurus carolinensis the red squirrel has become extinct in large parts of great britain and ireland and it is estimated that just over 80 of the remaining populations in great britain are in scotland with the rest found in isolated forests or offshore islands in england and wales mathews et al 2018 the decline of red squirrel populations has arisen due to the spread of and disease mediated competition with the north american grey squirrel which since its introduction at the turn of the 20th century has replaced red squirrels throughout most of england and wales and parts of scotland and ireland middleton 1930 white et al 2016 the competitive interactions between the two species can lead to increased stress in red squirrels reduced body size and fecundity as well as measurable reductions in local juvenile red squirrel recruitment rates wauters et al 2002 gurnell et al 2004 bertolino et al 2014 santicchia et al 2018 grey squirrels are a reservoir host of squirrelpox virus sqpv that is asymptomatic and endemic in grey squirrels but fatal to red squirrels chantrey et al 2014 the replacement of red squirrels has been reported to occur up to twenty five times faster in areas where sqpv is present tompkins et al 2003 rushton et al 2006 recent research has indicated that the recovery of native predators can benefit native prey species that compete with invasive prey in circumstances where predation is more pronounced on the naïve invasive species sheehy and lawton 2014 twining et al 2022b pine martens martes martes are generalist semi arboreal predators native to great britain and ireland that have been reported to prey upon grey squirrels at a greater frequency compared to red squirrels twining et al 2020c which is believed to occur due to evolutionary naïvety and a lack of anti predator behaviours in grey squirrels twining et al 2020a recent legal protection has led to the on going recovery of pine marten that has led to the recolonisation of much of their historical range in scotland and ireland this recovery has resulted in landscape scale declines of established grey squirrel populations that has allowed the re establishment of red squirrels in regions where they have previously been excluded sheehy and lawton 2014 twining et al 2022b 2020c sheehy et al 2018 bamber et al 2020 there remains a paucity of information on the impact of pine marten recovery on the prevalence of sqpv in squirrel populations but see roberts and heesterbeek 2021 current red squirrel conservation efforts aim to mitigate the impacts of grey squirrels on red squirrels gill et al 2019 schuchert et al 2014 saving scotland s red squirrels 2019 scotland 2012 they include targeted squirrel control to remove or reduce the density of established populations of grey squirrels gill et al 2019 schuchert et al 2014 to prevent further grey squirrel range expansion and reduce disease transmission white et al 2016 saving scotland s red squirrels 2019 conservation efforts also include the designation and management of stronghold forests that are intended to provide refuge for red squirrels against the incursion of grey squirrels scotland 2012 slade et al 2020 in wales like elsewhere the arrival and range expansion of grey squirrels led to widespread replacement of red squirrels mathews et al 2018 efforts to re introduce red squirrels have included translocations with releases occurring on anglesey an island off the north coast of wales see fig 1 after a programme of grey squirrel eradication monitoring and grey squirrel control guided by mathematical modelling is used to protect the re established red squirrel populations in wales jones et al 2017 red squirrels have also maintained a limited presence via the use of population reinforcement in an attempt to prevent extinction in a 5 000 hectare upland commercial conifer plantation in central north wales previous pine marten reinforcement translocations whereby 51 pine marten were captured in scotland and released into mid wales between 2015 and 2017 vincent wildlife trust unpub data sainsbury et al 2019 has resulted in regional population establishment in mid wales whilst a programme to release pine marten into north wales near the coastal city of bangor see fig 1 has recently begun the reinforcement of pine marten populations in wales could act to reduce sqpv prevalence and grey squirrel density and potentially lead to the predator mediated recovery of red squirrels mathematical models have successfully been used to elucidate the mechanisms that underpin red squirrel replacement highlighting that disease mediated competition from grey squirrels and predation by shared predators are key factors tompkins et al 2003 roberts and heesterbeek 2021 they have been adapted to inform conservation strategies to protect red squirrels suggesting that grey squirrel control which has been empirically shown to reduce sqpv prevalence schuchert et al 2014 may be insufficient to prevent the spatial spread of sqpv white et al 2016 furthermore models have been used to outline control strategies that can result in local grey squirrel extinction and prevent the re invasion of grey squirrels into red squirrel strongholds jones et al 2017 croft et al 2021 in this paper we extend established spatial modelling approaches that represent the interactions of red and grey squirrels and sqpv in realistic landscapes white et al 2016 jones et al 2017 to include the dynamics of pine marten and examine the indirect effect of pine marten predation on red and grey squirrel interactions and the prevalence and persistence of a viral pathogen sqpv in the prey populations the model system will incorporate habitat information from land cover datasets for north wales and will therefore be representative of realistic landscapes see fig 1 using the model we will examine the potential spread of pine marten from populations in mid wales as well as from populations introduced into north wales our aim will be to assess the likely impact of pine marten predation on red and grey squirrel abundance and the prevalence and persistence of sqpv in north wales while we recognise that model results are at best an approximation of reality they allow key scenarios to be tested and compared and can provide a starting point for wider scientific debate and further studies specifically the model results presented in this study will provide a key platform for informing applied conservation practice in great britain and ireland including guiding the decision to support the translocation of pine marten into north wales furthermore the findings from the model system are also applicable in general highlighting how the recovery of native predators may act to control invasive species and indirectly the infectious diseases they harbour 2 materials and methods 2 1 model framework the mathematical model adapts previous models of the red and grey squirrel system which used classical deterministic approaches tompkins et al 2003 to develop a spatial stochastic model in realistic landscapes white et al 2016 jones et al 2017 to include pine marten population dynamics the model simulates the demographics of red squirrels grey squirrels pine marten and sqpv infection along with intra and inter specific competition between squirrels and predation from pine marten on squirrels the model runs on an array of 1 km by 1 km grid squares linked by dispersal to approximate the real heterogeneous landscape of north wales the model uses land cover data in conjunction with carrying capacity estimates associated with specific tree species to estimate species carrying capacities in each grid square the deterministic model for the system upon which the stochastic model is based highlights the key population processes that we consider the deterministic system represents the population density and infection status with regard to sqpv for susceptible s r and infected i r red squirrels susceptible s g infected i g and recovered r g grey squirrels as well as the density of pine marten p the model is as follows 1 d s g d t a g t b s g β s g i g i r μ g s g p d i g d t β s g i g i r b i g γ i g μ g i

t a p b p p p p c c 1 k m 0 p p c c 1 k m the model framework that we use to represent the dynamics of red and grey squirrels and sqpv has been used in previous studies and yields results that are a good match with empirical data see white et al 2016 jones et al 2017 here a g t represents the periodic birth rate of grey squirrels which assumes births occur for only half of the year between march and september each year representing observed peak litter periods and periods with no breeding activity the term for a r t is equivalent to a g t with the subscripts for r and g interchanged note h r s r i r and h g s g i g r g represent the total populations for red and grey squirrels respectively the natural rate of adult mortality b 0 9 barkalow jr et al 1970 is assumed to be the same for both red and grey squirrels but the rates of maximum reproduction differ with red squirrel birth rate a r 3 and grey squirrel birth rate a g 3 4 tompkins et al 2003 the competitive effect of grey squirrels on red squirrels is denoted by c g 1 65 whilst that of red squirrels on grey squirrels is denoted by c r 0 61 highlighting the asymmetry in competitive outcome bryce et al 2002 sqpv is transmitted both within and between each squirrel species in a density dependent manner with transmission coefficient β 0 83 see section 2 3 below infected red squirrels die due to the disease at rate α 26 and infected greys recover at rate γ 13 tompkins et al 2003 the susceptibilities to crowding q r q g which are specific to each grid square are set to ensure the average density over one year is equal to the estimated carrying capacity in each grid square for that year with the carrying capacity being defined using tree species information that is given in table 2 see also section 2 2 below pine marten are generalist omnivores whose density is also driven by resource limitation pine martens like most mustelids display intra sexual territoriality with resident animals of the same sex having non overlapping stable home ranges o mahony 2014 birks 2020 consequently we assume pine marten density p can reach its local maximum value in any 1 km grid square which we denote p c c 1 k m with the carrying capacity of that square being dependent solely on habitat see table 2 thus we assume that as generalists pine marten density is not dependent on local squirrel availability for the pine marten birth rate we assume an average lifespan of 5 years with sexual maturity occurring after 2 years we assume a 50 50 sex ratio with an average annual litter size which ranges between 1 and 5 kits per litter of 2 birks 2020 this leads to 0 6 new borns per year per individual which translates into an annual birth rate of 0 47 we assume a 6 month breeding season and therefore the births occur at a constant rate a p 0 94 for 6 months and a p 0 for the rest of the year for the death rate we use the inverse of the average life span which yields a constant annual death rate due to all possible factors of b p 0 2 the predation rate of pine marten on grey squirrels μ g is defined such that a pine marten density of 0 36 km 2 will cause a 30 drop in grey squirrel density a conservative estimate given empirical evidence that grey squirrels can be eradicated by pine marten at densities that are found in scotland and ireland twining et al 2022b 2020c sheehy et al 2018 which gives a value of μ g 1 5 given the uncertainty in this value the predation rate will be altered with a lower value of μ g 0 75 and a high value of μ g 2 25 to explore the impact of the predation rate on the squirrel dynamics the average frequency of occurrence of red squirrels in pine marten diet 2 5 sheehy and lawton 2014 3 7 twining et al 2020c has been reported to be lower than that of grey squirrels 15 6 sheehy and lawton 2014 twining et al 2020c and therefore we set μ r 0 2 μ g to reflect the higher occurrence of grey squirrels in pine marten diet whilst we recognise that frequency of occurrence does not directly imply differences in predation rates we believe that the dietary data which is taken from a wide and representative sample that includes both allopatric and sympatric populations of red and grey squirrels at various densities is a suitable proxy for the difference in predation given the lack of quantitative data on the functional response of the pine marten to these two prey species predation is assumed to be unaffected by squirrel infection status all parameter values assume an annual time scale to generate the stochastic model table 1 the rates in the deterministic model are converted into probabilities of events that account for changes in individual grid square level abundance renshaw 1993 we also add squirrel and pine marten dispersal in the stochastic model to represent movement between grid squares for both squirrel species the model assumes density dependent dispersal such that squirrel dispersal increases as density increases see jones et al 2016 and table 1 legend for more details pine marten dispersal occurs on a 5 km by 5 km gridded scale which has a defined habitat dependent carrying capacity p c c that is the sum of the carrying capacities of the 25 1 km grid squares that are contained within the 5 km region see section 2 2 when the pine marten population exceeds p c c the excess individuals are assumed to disperse into one of the 8 neighbouring 5 km by 5 km regions if the pine marten density in the chosen destination region is at or above p c c the dispersing pine marten are assumed to die and are thus removed this ensures pine marten do not disperse continuously when densities are high across the landscape in addition to local dispersal we assume rare long distance dispersal that can occur at any time with dispersal rate d p 0 05 which was chosen to fit the pine marten expansion rate that has been observed in northern ireland j twining unpub data see also twining et al 2022b during the long range dispersal event pine marten can disperse to any grid square chosen at random within a 50 km radius this reflects observations in which tracked individuals who were previously released into mid wales have been recorded over 103 km away from the point of release after approximately 6 months mcnicol et al 2020 in the model we assume all grid squares outside the study area have zero carrying capacity consequently neither squirrel nor pine marten can disperse into these grid squares in the model anglesey and mainland wales are considered as different gridded maps with the transition between these maps being governed by a single grid square that is designated as the britannia bridge which represents the primary expansion route for grey squirrels onto anglesey movement between anglesey and the mainland requires squirrels martens to disperse via the grid square designated as the britannia bridge this ensures that the 5 km by 5 km pine marten regions do not overlap both anglesey and the mainland 2 2 carrying capacities to estimate plausible carrying capacities for each grid square we use the national forest inventory woodland wales 2018 dataset which includes information on whether the primary tree species in a given area is broadleaf or conifer the urban wales 2015 dataset which outlines the urban habitat as well as a major rivers dataset which locates the main rivers in wales to create a map detailing the proportion of each habitat type in a 1 km by 1 km grid square this information can be used in conjunction with fixed estimates of squirrel and pine marten density values for broadleaf and conifer habitat table 2 to generate carrying capacity estimates for each species for each 1 km grid square in the model see figure s1 in the supp info for carrying capacity maps we use constant estimates of pine marten and squirrel carrying capacity thereby ignoring factors such as seasonal variation and seed crop cycles that are inherent in the real system croft et al 2021 croft et al 2021 suggest this is appropriate for mixed species woodland where asynchrony in tree species masting maintains a more stable food resource and consequently reduces amplitude in squirrel density variation than would be expected in woodland with lower tree diversity this also allows us to compare different model scenarios without the added complication that variation in resources would impose on the dynamics the grid square level pine marten carrying capacity values are used to create the 5 km by 5 km carrying capacity values that in turn are used to trigger pine marten dispersal the broadleaf conifer and urban squirrel capacity values are the medium values from the anglesey study conducted by jones et al 2016 however in line with recent studies for scotland slade et al 2020 twining et al 2020c we assume red squirrels have a competitive advantage over grey squirrels in purely coniferous habitat mixed mainly broadleaf carrying capacity consists of 65 broadleaf capacity 35 conifer carrying capacity whilst mixed mainly conifer is 65 conifer capacity 35 broadleaf capacity the carrying capacity values for scrub have been set at a low value to indicate that whilst neither squirrels nor pine marten would reside in this habitat they will utilise it and move through it to reach other habitats jones et al 2016 caryl et al 2012 twining et al 2020b open land is any region that does not have a named feature the small pine marten carrying capacity associated with open land indicates that whilst pine marten cannot reside in these regions they can cross these areas and reach available habitat beyond them the britannia bridge is the only available dispersal route between the island of anglesey and mainland wales this grid square has been given the same carrying capacity as the urban regions to allow free movement of squirrels and pine marten all carrying capacity values can be found in table 2 2 3 initial conditions currently red squirrels are resident in an upland conifer plantation in central north wales and on the island of anglesey with some red squirrels dispersing from anglesey across the britannia bridge into the region surrounding the city of bangor see fig 1 grey squirrels are established across the entirety of north wales except the island of anglesey given the absence of detailed density data we assumed grey squirrels are not present in the conifer plantation thus the model results will simulate the replacement of red squirrels due to dispersal from nearby known grey squirrel populations the squirrel initial conditions in the model therefore assume that red squirrels are at their carrying capacity in the regions where they are sole residents red and grey squirrels are at half their carrying capacity in the area around the city of bangor where they both reside and grey squirrels are at their carrying capacity in all other regions of north wales as indicated in figure s2 in the supp info in the model we consider two scenarios for pine marten initial conditions the first assumes that pine marten resident in mid wales migrate north with the initial population located in suitable habitat in mid wales which is the southern edge of our study region set at a quarter of the carrying capacity figure s3 a the second initial condition assumes the potential release of 20 pine marten 10 pine marten released in consecutive years at the start of the model simulation into the area surrounding the city of bangor figure s3 c in addition to dispersal from mid wales the release site at bangor is chosen as there have been recent releases of pine marten into the area surrounding the city with the aim of conserving red squirrels on the island of anglesey results where pine marten have been released into the region surrounding bangor only figure s3 b as well as a long term scenario whereby pine marten have colonised the entirety of wales figure s3 d are included in the supplementary information to generate the sqpv initial conditions the model was simulated for 10 years with only grey squirrels present the value of β 0 83 was used as this leads to a seroprevalence of 74 in grey squirrels schuchert et al 2014 sainsbury et al 2000 in a homogeneous population of 80 individuals in a 1 km by 1 km grid square which is representative of grey squirrel density per km 2 in regions in north wales where sqpv has been reported schuchert et al 2014 sainsbury et al 2000 the initial condition of sqpv shown in figure s4 in the supp info indicates that the model predicts variability in the prevalence of sqpv which is strongly linked to grey squirrel density across north wales 2 4 model realisations each model realisation follows a gillespie algorithm gillespie 1977 here the time between events is an exponentially distributed random variable that can be determined as t e v e n t ln σ r where σ is a random number drawn from a uniform distribution between zero and one and r is the sum of the event rates as defined in table 1 see also renshaw 1993 the event see table 1 which occurs at each time step is also chosen at random based on the relative event rates with changes in density and the associated probabilities updated after each event we run each realisation for 40 model years and run 10 realisations of the stochastic model for each scenario that we test 3 results 3 1 pine marten migration from mid wales there is little expansion in pine marten range during the first 10 years of simulation as it takes time for pine marten abundance to increase to levels that trigger local dispersal fig 2 thereafter local and rare long distance dispersal leads to pine marten range expansion into north wales and subsequent increases in density within 30 years such wide scale and rapid expansion matches real world scenarios and has for example been observed in northern ireland twining et al 2022b as shown in fig 2 the model suggests that pine marten expansion into north wales will take time thus allowing grey squirrels the opportunity to out compete and replace red squirrels in north west wales which could lead to the re colonisation of the island of anglesey as would be the case if grey squirrel control efforts were stopped jones et al 2016 fig 3 pine martens fail to establish at high density on the island anglesey by the end of the 40 year model simulation likely due to a lack of suitable habitat on the island as well as a lack of connectivity between the island and the mainland consequently grey squirrels continue to expand and replace red squirrels on the island a comparison between fig 3 and results showing red and grey squirrel occupancy in the absence of pine marten figure s5 in the supp info indicate that red squirrel replacement on the island of anglesey is predicted to be reduced when pine marten are present the presence of pine marten leads to the reduction of grey squirrel density fig 4 particularly from year 30 of the simulation onwards which coincides with the increase in pine marten density that occurs following dispersal fig 2 the suppression of grey squirrel density due to pine marten presence allows red squirrels resident in large conifer plantations to expand their range into neighbouring forests where they previously were excluded this occurs for all three rates of pine marten predation with the expansion of the red occupied region increasing with increasing predation rate the higher predation rates also lead to a removal of grey squirrels from regions where there is not a concurrent increase in red squirrel occupancy due to the lack of adjacent red squirrel populations fig 4 b c 3 2 pine marten reinforcement in north wales and migration from mid wales the combined effect of pine marten release into both north and mid wales is that pine marten range expansion is predicted to be more rapid as the time frame for the northern populations of pine marten to reach their carrying capacity is reduced fig 5 in particular the range expansion of pine marten across the north coast and south from these populations is now pronounced compare figs 2 e and 5 e where pine marten establish and recover to sufficient density they reduce grey squirrel density fig 7 pine marten populations in the north west of wales and later on the island of anglesey reduce the impact of grey squirrel expansion onto anglesey therefore the model system predicts that the pine marten release into north wales as opposed to the migrating pine marten from mid wales is potentially key to safeguarding the red squirrel population in north wales and on the island of anglesey especially for medium and high predation rates fig 6 b c the release of pine marten into north wales is also predicted to support an increase in red squirrel expansion from the resident population in the large conifer plantation and at high predations rates to facilitate the establishment of red squirrel populations into regions where they are excluded when pine marten migrate from mid wales alone 3 3 the impact of pine marten on sqpv sqpv is currently endemic in the grey squirrel populations of north wales fig 8 outlines the predicted impact of pine marten predation on sqpv for the scenario where pine marten have been introduced into north wales as well as migrated from mid wales as pine marten expand their range and increase in density fig 5 predation of grey squirrels reduces the grey squirrel density fig 7 to levels that cannot support sqpv fig 8 higher predation rates lead to greater more rapid reductions in sqpv prevalence the model predicts that sqpv will be eradicated from north west wales and from the island of anglesey after 10 years after 20 years of model simulation there emerges two distinct regions where sqpv remains endemic one region stretches from the north coast to the west coast whilst the other region is in the north east of north wales adjacent to the border between england and wales sqpv is largely absent from the conifer plantation by year 20 in the model and by year 30 of the model simulation the majority of north wales is predicted to be sqpv free sqpv is largely eradicated under all three predation rate scenarios by year 40 of the simulation notice that extinction of sqpv does not require the extinction of grey squirrels compare figs 7 and 8 but instead requires that grey squirrel density is reduced below a threshold value pine marten predation could therefore have an additional ecosystem benefit in terms of disease management even when predation does not lead to species eradication 3 4 alternative model scenarios we undertook a model scenario in which pine marten were released into north wales only with no expansion from mid wales the results are shown in the supplementary information figures s6 s7 the results are similar to those in fig 6 although the potential red squirrel range expansion into mid wales is more rapid when pine marten dispersal also occurred from mid wales nevertheless this indicates that the release of pine marten into north wales could be key to safeguarding the red squirrel population on the island of anglesey and to supporting the range expansion of red squirrels across north wales we also tested different pine marten release strategies in north wales our default of 10 individuals in two consecutive years or 20 individuals in one year or 5 individuals in four consecutive years but this had a minimal impact on the results we also considered a scenario where pine marten have been introduced at their carrying capacity into all suitable regions of north wales to simulate the long term impact of pine marten on red and grey squirrel interactions figures s8 s9 s10 at the low predation rate of μ g 0 75 the impact of pine marten predation is predicted to be sufficient to safeguard the red squirrel population resident in the conifer plantation and support moderate expansion of the red squirrel range to the south of the plantation however low levels of predation cannot prevent the expansion of grey squirrels onto the island of anglesey at medium and high predation rates the higher frequency of predation by pine marten on grey squirrels protects red squirrels on anglesey and the model suggests that the majority of central north wales could be viable for red squirrel occupation model results indicate that grey squirrels will still dominate the border region between england and wales the eastern border of our study region as well as the western peninsula ll y ˆ n peninsula due to the fragmented habitat which provides limited access routes into the peninsula from the rest of north wales the results presented here are averages of the ten model realisations that were generated using the stochastic model the results should not be viewed as definitive predictions of pine marten and squirrel population dynamics in particular the initial pine marten dispersal can vary due to the assumed random nature of the long distance dispersal this variability results in different initial patterns of pine marten dispersal in different model realisations and these variations can have a greater or lesser impact on squirrel interactions dependent on the distance between pine marten and squirrel populations this can subsequently impact the timing of certain squirrel events such as the transition onto anglesey by grey squirrels similarly given the competitive interactions that occur at the boundary between red and grey squirrel populations the variation at these sites is naturally higher than in single species regions where competition between species does not occur nevertheless in the long term pine marten become established across the entirety of the study region in all realisations and so their impact on squirrels becomes consistent 4 discussion in this study we provide theoretical evidence through empirically devised mathematical modelling of the impacts of the recovery of a native predator on the densities of two competitively linked prey species along with the prevalence of a virulent pathogen that mediates the replacement of the native species by the invasive competitor in the absence of pine marten sqpv led to the loss of around 80 of the red squirrel mainland population in an area of north west wales in 2020 21 shuttleworth et al 2022 however the model findings indicate that the recovery of the pine marten could result in the eradication of sqpv from the landscape thus reducing the threat of replacement of red squirrels by the invasive grey squirrel we demonstrate a viable mechanism for this which occurs through the predation and regulation of the host reservoir below the threshold for pathogen persistence results from the spatially explicit mathematical model developed here indicate that pine marten recovery will benefit native red squirrels in wales reversing the typical outcome of disease mediated competition between the two prey species the model indicates that empirically supported higher predation by the native predator of grey squirrels compared to red squirrels could safeguard current red squirrel populations and allow red squirrels to expand their range in north wales as has been observed in both scotland and ireland thus the model results demonstrate that the potential impacts of native predator recovery on native prey are multi faceted occurring through several linked indirect pathways through the predation of an invasive competitor and the subsequent suppression and extirpation of a virulent pathogen that is a key factor in species replacement in consensus with real world empirical data from other ecosystems twining et al 2022b 2020c sheehy et al 2018 this modelling study indicates that the population recovery of pine marten can lead to reductions in grey squirrel density or extirpation of grey squirrels and the recovery and range expansion of red squirrels on a landscape scale the key mechanism that underpins this result is that pine marten prey upon grey squirrels at a higher frequency than red squirrels which has been observed in the field sheehy and lawton 2014 twining et al 2020c prey regulation and persistence is sensitive to the force of predation which can occur at the individual level through a predator s functional response holling 1959 or at the population level through predator aggregation solomon 1949 we see this in our model with the combination of the predation coefficient and predator density driving grey squirrel extirpation while the predation coefficient is difficult to estimate observations of the extirpation of grey squirrels following pine marten establishment twining et al 2022b 2020c sheehy et al 2018 offers support that the model results shown for medium and high predation rates are reflective of the real system the model also suggests that grey squirrel extirpation could occur more rapidly in regions where pine marten recovery is adjacent to source populations of red squirrels for example grey extirpation is pronounced in large areas of coniferous forest where predation combines with inter specific competition from red squirrels roberts and heesterbeek 2021 slade et al 2022 in general the model results concur with findings from field and observational studies in northern ireland and scotland that indicate that pine marten can reverse the typical competitive outcome between red and greys squirrels in forest habitats twining et al 2022b 2020c sheehy et al 2018 we acknowledge that model studies are abstractions of the real systems and should not be used as definitive predictive tools particularly due to the difficulty inherent in assigning constant values to variable quantities such as predation rates and carrying capacities however model studies can be used to understand the qualitative dynamics elucidate critical mechanisms and predict potential outcomes of complex species interactions the model study here suggests that the range expansion and increase in density of pine marten in the uk could have significant benefits for the conservation of red squirrels that are threatened by grey squirrels both through lowering the density of the invasive competitor and reducing the prevalence of disease sqpv in this example pine marten are generalist predators and so will prey upon both red and grey squirrels twining et al 2020c halliwell 1997 as well as other native species and therefore pine marten recovery could threaten red squirrel viability where populations are fragmented or in habitats such as commercial conifer plantations that support low abundance of alternate prey species twining et al 2022b our model study assumes pine marten predation rates that are constant across all habitat types model results suggest that for pine marten densities that are in line with those from field observations from great britain and ireland twining et al 2022b 2020c sheehy et al 2018 increasing levels of predation in the absence of grey squirrels will reduce red squirrel population density however the model results suggest red squirrels can persist in the presence of pine marten predation in all habitat types albeit at low densities in conifer dominated habitat including when pine marten have recovered to carrying capacity levels see figure s8 red squirrels have been observed to persist at significantly lower densities where they co occur with pine marten in scotland halliwell 1997 additionally empirical evidence from landscape scale monitoring and multi species occupancy modelling demonstrated a positive influence of pine marten recovery on red squirrel occurrence at a landscape scale this is especially evident in broadleaf habitats where pine marten allow red squirrels to recover following the local extirpation of grey squirrels twining et al 2022b 2020c even though pine martens reduce the occurrence of red squirrels in areas dominated by conifer plantations in northern ireland twining et al 2022b these differences may highlight an unrealistic assumption in our model with habitat mediation of the interactions between native predator and prey being likely linked to the seasonal abundance or lack of alternate resources resulting in potentially increased predation pressure at certain times in some habitats twining et al 2022b the threat to red squirrels in conifer plantations may be reduced in great britain where the presence of numerically dominant field voles microtus agrestis results in distinct dietary differences between ireland and great britain field voles which are often a key prey item in diet studies in great britain e g caryl et al 2012 undergo inter annual cycles in abundance whilst pine marten diet during nadirs in these cycles appear relatively similar caryl et al 2012 twining et al 2019 theoretical modelling suggests that peaks in vole population cycles may provide temporal refuges for both squirrel species thus mediating the impacts of pine marten recovery on both species slade et al 2022 whilst these hypotheses remains empirically unvalidated we can draw inference from the better studied invasive species despite the presence of field voles in scotland and their potential to diffuse the population impacts of pine marten recovery on both prey species slade et al 2022 a quantitative investigation in scotland has demonstrated that even low density marten populations depress the occurrence of invasive grey squirrels with local extirpation of grey squirrels predicted sheehy et al 2018 the ubiquity of the impacts of pine marten recovery on grey squirrels across both systems both in the presence and absence of field voles scotland and ireland respectively raises expectations for similarity in the impacts on red squirrels between the two systems given the potential risk to red squirrel viability in conifer dominated habitats there is a need for more research on the relative impacts of pine martens on red squirrels in different contexts and ecological communities prey species may harbour infectious pathogens which can persist at endemic levels if for instance prey density exceeds a threshold that can support the pathogen lloyd smith et al 2005 the population recovery of predators can result in the regulation of prey populations when predation occurs across a range of observed prey densities turchin 1995 we considered a variety of different sustained predation rates on prey host populations and the threshold for disease persistence and we demonstrate the capacity for native predators to have significant impacts on pathogen prevalence and persistence in certain scenarios moore et al 2010 in our study system grey squirrels are a reservoir for sqpv that has little effect on grey squirrel health but leads to a deleterious infection in red squirrels and has been demonstrated as a key driver of species replacement in great britain and ireland tompkins et al 2002 our model results indicate that pine marten predation could be sufficient to reduce grey squirrel density to levels that cannot support endemic sqpv the reduced risk of transmission of sqpv from grey squirrels to neighbouring re establishing red squirrels would prevent the potential crash of local red squirrel populations due to a sqpv epidemic outbreak chantrey et al 2014 white and lurz 2014 shuttleworth et al 2022 the model results therefore provide a key example of how the recovery and re establishment of native predators can have an impact on both invasive species and pathogen persistence this provides additional support to recent work suggesting that increased predator diversity and density can reduce parasite transmission thereby highlighting the importance of predator communities for disease dynamics and ecosystem stability rohr et al 2015 although theory typically envisages predators suppressing disease as we predict here there is also striking evidence of predators increasing the chance of a disease outbreak strauss et al 2016 a key mechanism in determining potential predator effects on disease has been suggested to be the coupling of predator prey population dynamics and the selectivity of predation duffy and hall 2008 if pathogen infected individuals are more vulnerable to predation dick et al 2010 tanner et al 2019 predators may dramatically reduce disease in host populations however the opposite can also be true if susceptible individuals are more prone to predation then predation could increase disease prevalence in a population hatcher and dunn 2011 in the absence of empirical data on the selectivity of predation in the model system we assumed equal predation of infected and susceptible individuals and with this estimate for the selectivity of predation predators still suppress the infection thus we observe that the potential of predators to positively or negatively impact disease are not equal and we demonstrate that it is more likely that predators will reduce disease as only in special contexts e g when infected prey become much less susceptible to predation which is likely a rare occurrence that predation will have the potential to increase disease prevalence our model results predict that it will take approximately 5 10 years for pine marten density to increase to levels that are sufficient to provide a source for local dispersal with limited long distance dispersal occurring during this period thereafter local and rare long range dispersal of pine marten provides new source populations which leads to further more rapid range expansion such that north wales is largely occupied by pine marten after approximately 25 30 years this is likely to be a conservative estimate with recolonisation of all 32 counties in ireland without additional reinforcement occurring within a shorter time frame carey et al 2007 lawton et al 2015 2020 twining et al 2022a when the natural expansion of pine marten from populations in mid wales in the south of our study region is supplemented by the targeted release of pine marten into north wales the range expansion of pine marten is more rapid our model results therefore lend support to the use of translocated and captive bred founders to increase the rate of recovery and dispersal and genetic variability of native predator populations that can form part of the conservation approach to reduce the impact of invasive species bamber et al 2020 our model findings provide key information such as the creation of a scenario framework and the identification of uncertainties on the potential impact of pine marten re introductions in north wales the findings have been used to support pine marten translocations in north wales which will contribute to the delivery of the regional squirrel management strategy pine marten recovery has the potential to contribute to grey squirrel decline assuming for example that changes in grey squirrel behaviour or some adaptive response to predator presence does not act to reduce the proportionally higher predation of grey squirrels compared to red squirrels then pine marten recovery potentially offers a long term sustainable mechanism that could reverse the fortunes of the red squirrel it is recognised that monitoring and where necessary coordinated grey squirrel control i e via trapping or shooting must continue the parallel detection and removal of animals that disperse onto the island of anglesey will also need to be maintained in these periods shuttleworth et al 2020 progressively therefore such interventions may become even more targeted e g at localised grey squirrel populations inhabiting key habitats where pine marten density may be low or their presence ephemeral or infrequent such as urban parkland for example this type of integrated conservation management offers a dynamic and cost effective landscape scale approach to predator mediated control of invasive species dunn and marzano 2015 5 conclusion in this study we demonstrate the potential role native predators may have in reversing the replacement of a threatened native prey species by an established invasive species our model highlights a potential mechanism regulation of the invasive prey species through sustained predation over a range of densities and the resultant extirpation of a viral pathogen which otherwise catalyses the replacement of the native species by the invasive species this body of research has not only key system specific applied implications to inform future conservation policy and management strategy but also demonstrates the critical role of native predators in mitigating the impacts of disease and invasive species as well as supporting ecosystem stability credit authorship contribution statement andrew slade conceptualization methodology

24264,complex systems are generally challenging to model due to many variables whose relationships and dependencies are often difficult and time consuming to comprehend simplifying complex systems can remove barriers to adaptation and application by marginalized stakeholders the main aim of the proposed research is to compare two simplification methods i e endogenisation encapsulation and order oriented reduction eeor and thematic maps development tmd in terms of maintaining system integrity a case study was conducted in the rechna doab region of pakistan this was a qualitative system dynamics model study which included 79 variables 32 duplicate or ghost variables and 15 loops eeor simplifies causal loop diagrams clds by removing exogenous variables and adjusting loops in successive steps in this study eeor eliminated 46 variables and 6 critical feedback loops during the simplification of the complex case study cld and did not maintain the system s integrity the main risk of this technique is eliminating variables without understanding their significance accordingly despite the goal of a better understanding eeor led to a loss of 60 of the final merged cld tmd divided the final integrated case study cld into four thematic sub modules agriculture environmental social and industrial and government subsidies each variable and loop were placed in their respective thematic sub modules this separation enhanced the understanding and evaluation of individual thematic sub modules when recombined into a single diagram these sub modules were able to represent the entire system without losing any information this research can help to simplify complex system models to help system understanding by novice stakeholders while maintaining the integrity of the system consequently this simplification approach can help further increase stakeholder engagement in participatory modelling exercises keywords causal loop diagram participatory modeling soil salinity data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction effective and meaningful stakeholder engagement is increasingly a key objective of policymakers in participatory planning it may be particularly helpful in decision making processes that deal with the complexity of sustainable management of socio ecological systems ses hlp 2021 undrr 2022 accordingly capturing stakeholder views mental models and experiences in a visual and easy to understand format is vital for understanding the complexity inherent in ses as they interact across social economic physical and environmental boundaries tariq et al 2021 fostering greater stakeholder engagement has been shown to significantly impact policy design and interventions for the sustainable management of ecological resources across several settings inam et al 2017 jones et al 2018 with the importance given to greater engagement among diverse stakeholder groups water resources management organisations in the european union and worldwide are reformulating their frameworks to involve stakeholders in the policy formation process rizzo et al 2021 using participatory approaches can assist in reducing the communication gap between stakeholders and supports adaptive management during the implementation of a policy or an intervention clare et al 2017 jones 2019 successful stakeholder engagement depends on the effective involvement of participants throughout the data collection and design process to capture their requirements jones 2019 various data acquisition methods are used to obtain stakeholders views such as pattern it mediated modelling php5 and causal loop diagrams clds belt 2004 devine wright 2020 mallery et al 2012 williams and hummelbrunner 2010 among these approaches pattern it mediated modelling and php5 are used to graphically capture data from stakeholder workshops to improve the understanding of a ses through a model however the graphical representation of these approaches is quite complex restricting some participants from contributing to the model alternatively clds can offer a more straightforward and easier to use graphical approach to enhance the understanding and analysis of complex systems perrone et al 2020 1 1 causal loop diagrams clds using clds can highlight the main variables and the cause and effect relationships between them that can reflect stakeholder s mental models which consist of variables and causal links with positive or negative polarity schaffernicht 2010 causal links join the independent variables to dependent variables by using positive or negative polarities linking the positive or negative multi variables with causal links produces feedback loops that indicate the ultimate effect of an action on a variable problem a positive polarity indicates the direct impact of the independent variable on the dependent variable williams and hummelbrunner 2010 for example if the cause increases the effect will also increase or if the cause decreases then the effect will also decrease alternatively a negative polarity indicates the inverse effect between independent and dependent variables i e if the cause escalates the effect will decrease or if the cause decreases then the effect will increase higgins 2013 clds are a flexible practical set of feedback driven tools for qualitative system analysis inam et al 2015 that can potentially play an important role in helping to resolve social economic issues through system modelling seki et al 2020 clds have been effectively utilised in various applications ranging from business management public health education policy water management planning and management and sustainable natural resources management inam et al 2017 kazak et al 2019 sahin et al 2020 in addition clds have been used in taxation finance management and other applications seki et al 2020 these diagrams are particularly useful in investigating the original feedback structures of a system and can help capture a problem variable s dynamic nature malard et al 2017 clds have long been used in system dynamics modeling to clarify relationships between variables in simulation models they have beenused in community based participatory modelling for sustainable management in agriculture and food security herrera 2018 clds can facilitate stakeholders discussions on the boundaries of the simulation model and focus on the mechanism of the problem behaviour and the critical components of the system under investigation herrera and kopainsky 2020 however clds have particular challenges that may complicate diagrams and result in a reduced understanding of the model particularly among those using the approach for the first time one of the most significant issues in the process is when all individual participant clds are merged into a single group cld diagram since this may result in a complicated diagram that is too complicated unclear for some stakeholders and does not contribute to greater understanding inam et al 2015 furthermore merging all the loops and variables can sometimes create a very complex cld diagram that can lead to confusion defeating one of the main purposes of using clds in the first place bureš 2017 moreover such complex clds can result in over complicated system dynamics models i e quantified models which are not necessarily a better outcome as this does not necessarily contribute to a greater understanding of the system curzio and fortis 2012 sometimes too many details can distract the focus from important points and can add unnecessary costs and delays to the project bureš 2017 elmaraghy et al 2012 additionally novice stakeholders may not be able to effectively contribute to the process as the complexity of the system increases viana 2017 workshop participants can sometimes lose interest in a modelling exercise if large and cumbersome clds or sd models are shared with them frannek et al 2016 1 2 cld simplification approaches accordingly any approach that can simplify clds and still capture diverse stakeholder views for a better understanding of systemic issues is useful there are different simplification methods for complex clds in the literature such as edge bundling folding the network indicated feedback loops and colouring allender et al 2015 du et al 2010 eberlein 1989 yao et al 2015 edge bundling is a technique for simplifying network diagrams by spotting the diagram s edge to make it bundle to eliminate visual clutter yao et al 2015 various studies have discussed the application of the edge bundling technique ellis and dix 2007 gansner et al 2011 holten and van wijk 2009 it does not simplify the diagram s processes for understanding rather it improves the graphical representation based on spotting at the diagram s edge apart from this folding the network is another approach to enhance diagram simplicity by replacing variables from one point to another but it may also remove essential system processes du et al 2010 some researchers have successfully implemented the folding strategy in various research fields costa et al 2007 xiao et al 2008 xuan and wu 2009 alternatively eberlein 1989 describes a theory to increase model simplification in terms of indicating the essential feedback loops in the linearised model according to selected dynamic behaviour eberlein 1989 this theory highlights the significance of drawing the clds digitally and supports the correct positioning of the loops in the system several suggested articles have utilised this approach to simplify feedback loop procedures davison 1966 eberlein 1989 eberlein and hines 1987 however this approach may impact the system s integrity and lead to incorrect outcomes finally colouring is a community based approach that simplifies the diagram by colour coding according to themes allender et al 2015 depending on the variables in the diagram different colours are applied to the complex cld throughout the process each variable type has a different colour which enables a clear representation of the diagram various scientific studies have used this approach to improve the visualisation of complex diagrams allender et al 2015 finegood et al 2010 hammond 2009 king et al 2011 although the complexity of the diagram remains unresolved colouring may significantly improve its readability and help divide the diagrams content into more straightforward and easy to understand sections the above approaches and their limitations demonstrate the significant research gap that this paper aims to address policies and interventions designed to address specific problems risk failing if relevant stakeholders views and opinions are not taken into account clare et al 2017 stakeholder groups that have traditionally been marginalized in decision making processes may decline to participate in participatory processes if complex and difficult to interpret clds are presented to them in interactions and workshop activities inam et al 2017 thus a better approach to simplify complex multi stakeholder clds is required for more meaningful stakeholder engagement that can translate into greater participation improved understanding and capturing of the mental maps of stakeholders and better integration of the perspectives of stakeholders in the policy making process for effective stakeholder engagement an overall picture and a small model are preferred for clarity allowing for a better understanding of a system forrester 2007 despite the need for clarity there is a lack of potential methods for simplifying a final merged cld consequently we compare two techniques to simplify clds the first is the eeor method and the second is the thematic maps development tmd method explored here for the first time these two strategies both seek to address the level of complexity of the diagram 1 3 endogenisation encapsulation and order oriented reduction eeor method the eeor technique consists of seven steps bures 2017 i use duplicate variables to prevent the crossing of linked relationships ii define the level of the complexity of the whole system under consideration iii identify and label all exogenous variables iv eliminate all selected exogenous variables endogenisation v label and then eliminate single input and single output variables siso and replace the links encapsulation vi label and then eliminate single input double output sido or double input single output diso variables order oriented reduction and vii number and name the loops to establish loop behaviour the eeor technique reduces the complexity of the group cld however it can in some cases also lead to the loss of important information variables loops and the system s integrity during the simplification process bureš 2017 1 4 thematic maps development tmd method the tmd method explored in this research can reduce the complexity of a cld while maintaining the system s integrity halbe 2009 inam et al 2015 the tmd method includes the following four steps i classification of the variables according to their nature i e social physical environmental etc ii identification and marking of overlapping variables that are common to one or more modules iii identification and labelling of loops to avoid mixing the variables during the removal process and iv reduction which involves dividing the complex cld into different sub modules as per the nature of the cld being considered such as agricultural environmental governmental social and economic models halbe 2009 inam et al 2015 partitioning a system into such sub modules or dimensions has also been considered beneficial in other contexts such as community disaster resilience at the local level to encourage stakeholder participation and engagement tariq et al 2021 such a separation allows for the details of the different aspects of the problem to be evaluated separately simplifying the model structure for future uses such as in the case of quantification it should be noted that the thematic sub models are still linked with each other by their common variables and no vital information or detail is lost thus maintaining the system s integrity the tmd method is designed to improve upon previous methods in the literature it combines elements from other approaches to allow for the simplification across topical dimensions of an ses that can be separated colour coded and collapsed expanded according to the context of its use hence the tmd method has the potential to simplify clds and can focus discussions in workshops on the dimensions or aspects of the problem considered by stakeholders individually as well as combined and result in more accessible and easier to read and use clds for more meaningful stakeholder engagement this paper compares both methods i e eeor and tmd to explore which one might be better suited to simplifying complex clds in a case study of soil salinity in the rechna doab basin in pakistan this research should be helpful to other researchers working in the fields of stakeholder engagement system dynamics and social ecological systems the case study uses data from previous research conducted by some of the co authors of this paper on the development of clds for soil salinity in the rechna doab basin of pakistan inam et al 2015 and builds on this previous research by applying the eeor and tmd methods the paper is organised as follows section 1 looked at several existing simplification techniques section 2 covers the study area in detail the details of the simplification approaches is discussed in section 3 and section 4 summarizes the results and provides a comparison of the two strategies while section 5 concludes with the significant findings and potential future work 2 study area the cld modelling study was conducted for the rechna doab basin pakistan to compare the two simplification methods the research area is located between two rivers making it more complex and resulting in a wide range of hydrological conditions inam et al 2015 due to variations in hydrological conditions this region has been well researched and is suitable for use in modelling exercises the area of the rechna doab translated locally as the land between two rivers is situated at the coordinates 30 37 28 n and 71 49 19 e and is located under the haveli canal command downstream of pakistan s ravi and chenab rivers shown in fig 1 it is situated at the inter fluvial basin of both rivers covering roughly 732 50 k m 2 the area is potentially cultivable land although 30 of the area is presently fallow due to high soil salinity levels rehman et al 1997 the mean size of the region s landholdings is 3 85ha inam et al 2015 due to the lack of surface water supply 75 of farmers use groundwater of marginal quality in the area rehman et al 1997 groundwater depth varies from 3 6 m with groundwater electrolyte concentrations beyond 1500 ppm in the middle portion of the basin in contrast the use of marginal quality groundwater has made the area salt affected better policies and good management practices could potentially reclaim this area according to estimates 26 2 of the total irrigated area of pakistan is saline but nearly 70 of this area is only moderately saline and can potentially be reclaimed kazmi et al 2012 it is a well documented region with many studies collecting field recorded data over a long period since the early 1960s many government organisations have actively monitored water table depths water quality and soil salinity in the region i e wapda irrigation department and land reclamation department inam et al 2015 3 methodology the eeor and tmd methods were applied to the study area one by one to address the complexity of the cld first the seven steps of the eeor method were applied to simplify a complex cld which is explained with a generic example below next the tmd method was used similarly to simplify a complex cld tmd is introduced here for the first time in this context and section 4 discusses its application in detail using diagrams in section 4 3 a comparison of the methods is provided including a discussion of the advantages and limitations 3 1 eeor method endogenisation encapsulation and order oriented reduction eeor method is used to simplify complex clds bureš 2017 the flowchart in fig 2 illustrates the step wise implementation of the eeor method based on the approach of bures 2017 a cld is a qualitative model used to study system processes and is based on capturing the many endogenous exogenous and auxiliary variables present in a system merged or group clds are more complex and are developed by combining individual stakeholder clds or combining all individual variables recorded during group stakeholder interviews schaffernicht 2010 when all these variables and stakeholder information are linked together in one cld diagram the diagram becomes more complex group clds join all these variables and can be classified into four possible configurations these are multi system input and multi system output mimo single input single output siso double input single output diso and single input double output sido variables as shown in fig 3 mimo variables are those which form the system structure and considerably impact system performance conroy and gupta 2015 in the first step the reduction may be performed from the least complex to more complex model components such as siso variable to diso and sido variables the degree of relative reduction entire cld complexity vs the highest order of eliminated variables is quite similar at all stages of complexity endogenisation is a process which identifies and removes all input and output system mimo variables in the encapsulation method all siso variables are labelled and removed simultaneously the last order based reduction step should be performed by eliminating diso and sido variables respectively the three critical processes endogenisation encapsulation and order based reduction are arranged according to their impact on system integrity if endogenisation can be done it should be completed before considering encapsulation likewise if encapsulation can be done then it must be performed instead of reduction the eeor method was divided into seven steps according to the order of the above three techniques to simplify the complex merged diagrams as the complexity of the clds will be reduced principally in an iterative manner the structures used as generic examples are described below for a better understanding as shown in fig 4 5 bureš 2017 3 1 1 using duplicate variables to construct a diagram complex clds consist of many variables and are very difficult to draw without the intersection of single links the understandability of the cld can generally be improved by using duplicate or so called ghost variables bureš 2017 if these duplicate variables are utilised they should be used as inputs to other variables using these ghost variables in this manner can reduce the complexity of the cld at the start of the process the number of ghost or duplicate variables such as stress level addictions and living space is encircled in the generic example as shown in fig 4 a the number of duplicate variables is reduced when these variables are replaced or removed 3 1 2 defining the level of complexity cld complexity can be described in different ways large grouped clds are often challenging to interpret because of their graphical complexity and hence might not achieve their stated purpose i e helping understand the system processes for deeper insight inam et al 2015 the level of cld complexity depends upon the number of loops attached to each variable hence the more mimo variables in the cld the greater the complexity fig 3 a shows that groundwater depletion is connected with mimo variables the level of complexity can be shown as follows 1 y f x 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 where y represents the independent variable named groundwater depletion and x1 x2 x3 and x4 denote dependent function variables such as recharge discharge life cycle crop yield water availability etc bures 2017 if y changes the value of dependent variables also changes as does the whole function which increases the complexity of the model this additional level of complexity makes it challenging to explain how much input variables affect the independent variable in the model and how much the output variables change in response making the clds harder to understand and use with stakeholders in contrast fig 3 b shows a simple system with a siso that is more straightforward to discuss with stakeholders enhancing the model s applicability and making it more effective for stakeholder engagement if the number of siso variables is greater than the number of mimo variables in the diagram the system becomes less complex and easier to understand on the other hand if the number of mimo variables is greater than the number of siso variables the system becomes more complex and harder to understand 3 1 3 labelling of all exogenous variables a large proportion of model variables are typically exogenous variables exogenous variables are those whose value is decided outside the model s boundary thus any change in a model due to outside factors results from these exogenous variables richardson 2011 these variables must be noted so that essential information is not lost during the simplification process in our generic example the exogenous variables are encircled such as pets economic threats the density of cars quality of residential life space sexual life parent s problem workload and the number of vehicles as shown in fig 4 b they will be eliminated in the next step 3 1 4 eliminate all selected variables endogenisation all exogenous variables must be identified before their elimination it is suggested to eliminate all variables in one step to avoid confusion caused by any new exogenous variables that could be generated as a product of this step blind branches describe the cause and effect relationship between exogenous variables part of the branch and other subsequent variables not connected to a feedback loop blind branches can be used to increase the speed of this step as well every blind branch ends in a variable that is a section of the feedback loop bureš 2017 finally we remove all the selected exogenous variables as shown in fig 4 c 3 1 5 label then eliminate siso variables and replace the links encapsulation once exogenous variables are erased the system behaviour is fully described by its structure sterman 2000 siso variables represent the transformation elements that induce change in the system dynamics from one point to another which can then be replaced by a structural change in the model mcglashan et al 2016 again in our model example we identify and encircle all siso variables such as work certainty irritation and responsibility as shown in fig 4 d and eliminate all these variables to see the resultant diagram in fig 5 a two issues must be noted during this phase first any new link polarities must be defined the new link polarity depends on the system s total number of negative polarities the signum technique can be used for this task as it results in only two values 0 or 1 to explain the type of link polarity bureš 2017 s second this method will remove any local feedback in which only two variables are included 3 1 6 label and then eliminate sido or diso variables order based reduction after the encapsulation process when all exogenous and siso variables disappear it is recommended to identify all sido and diso variables for example in fig 5 b variables like happiness health communication and arguments make the diagram more complex simultaneously eliminating all these variables can simplify the diagram as represented in fig 5 c thus the elimination process is completed according to order based reduction and the remaining final diagram is shown in fig 5 d 3 1 7 behavior of established loops the duplicate variables are then eventually merged in this step the feedback loops are given a name and numbered and their behaviour is established the resulting diagram is much simpler than the original ones final diagram shown in fig 5 d it concisely represents critical system feedback processes there are two feedback loops found in this respective diagram for example in loop 2 only three variables are needed to describe the dynamic process of that loop in our generic example 3 2 thematic maps development thematic maps show information about the relationship of a particular subject with another subject inam et al 2015 it represents the spatial distribution of an identifiable variable and provides an informational description of an area rather than data in detail perrone et al 2020 the tmd approach divides the merged clds into thematic sub modules showing the whole system s environmental social economic governance and agricultural components and any other modules defined by the research question this method classifies all the variables into thematic sub models according to the nature of the variable consequently this type of partition helps consider the information of various dimensions in isolation from other variables it also helps simplify the model structure for future estimation purposes for example the thematic sub module of agriculture only deals with the respective variables with the same units while the social sub module deals with variables such as change in migration and industrialisation the variables of the environmental thematic sub module for example groundwater quality irrigation and wastewater production describe the varying conditions of the environment due to soil salinity and the economic sub module considers the role of government subsidies for canal lining and modern irrigation techniques these thematic sub modules of complex causal loop diagrams can be connected with a common variable the tmd technique is used to simplify the complexity of diagrams in four steps as shown in fig 6 an example from our case study demonstrates the four steps of the technique 3 2 1 classification of variables in the first step we indicate and mark all variables according to their respective disciplines after marking all variables they are arranged into thematic sub modules different colours mark the variables to represent their respective thematic sub modules shown in fig 7 a for example the orchard growth variable is green indicating it is only related to the thematic sub module of agriculture the evaporation variable which can only be related to the environmental sub module is written in blue similarly every variable is placed into the four different thematic sub modules based on their nature 3 2 2 overlapping variable after the classification of variables the next important step is to mark the overlapping variables to maintain the integrity of the cld until it is decomposed into thematic sub modules overlapping variables are those in the cld that are common to all or some thematic sub modules and help connect the thematic sub modules the diagram s partition into thematic sub models becomes impossible without identifying the overlapping variables for example in our case study canal lining surface water availability and soil salinity are the overlapping variables common in all sub modules as shown in fig 7 the next step is identifying the loop shown in fig 7 b 3 2 3 identification of loops the next step is to identify the nature of loops according to the respective variables in this section it is essential to point out the loops and their respective variable type such as environmental agricultural government influence social and economic thematic sub modules after identifying these loops with their respective variables we can eliminate the remaining variables without losing crucial information and leave only those considered for insight and understanding this step results in selected loops of each sub module being included in the complex diagram which can be shown according to stakeholder desire or focus in this paper we focus on the agriculture sub module as an example other sub modules follow the same process but are omitted for brevity fig 7 b shows the identification of loops and variables of the agriculture thematic sub module and the arrows in red colour represent the loop of the respective thematic sub module three loops are identified and all other variables are eliminated in the next step during loop identification some variables are not related to the respective thematic sub module but are present in the loop as they are necessary for the loop completion of the sub module 3 2 4 reduction after identifying the loop the next process is partitioning the diagram into different thematic sub modules and eliminating variables of other disciplines that are not of interest the shadow or ghost variables are eventually merged into loops in this section these loops are completed for each sub module and are named according to the loop discipline all the loops of the sub modules are arranged by a given number and feedback loop process as examples the final versions of the agricultural and environmental thematic sub modules are shown in fig 8 for brevity only two sub modules are illustrated here it should be noted that all these thematic sub modules are connected through common or overlapping variables 4 results and discussion the two methods eeor and tmd discussed in the previous sections can each be employed to simplify any complex cld the development of group clds for modelling purposes has been widely used in many disciplines scott et al 2016 clds have become important in participatory systems modelling since the mid 1980s andersen and richardson 1997 peck 1998 various limitations of group modelling have been discussed in many studies e g andersen et al 2007 richardson 2013 rouwette et al 2011 however clds still represent a valuable tool for graphically showing relationships which can be improved by simplifying the methods shown in this study the following section demonstrates their applicability and validates the two methods with the help of a case study taken from a previous study conducted by several of the authors the case study was conducted in the rechna doab region of pakistan focusing on qualitative modelling through stakeholder built clds to address the problem of soil salinity and its management policies in the basin the original case study group cld was developed by merging all individual cld diagrams of eleven stakeholders into one group merged cld diagram inam et al 2015 as shown in fig 9 a this group built cld diagram contained 79 variables 32 duplicate variables and 15 different loops the diagrams were redrawn in the vensim software package ple version used for the modelling and simulation of system dynamics in the present study two methods were applied to the case study for cld simplification the eeor method and the tmd method the following sections discuss and compare both approaches including the advantages and limitations of each finally based on the case study results we recommend the best method for simplifying a complex cld 4 1 eeor endogenisation encapsulation and order oriented based reduction the eeor method is used first to simplify the complex final group cld in the case study eeor method follows a seven step process as discussed in the methodology section first the duplicate variables were used to reduce cross arrow links making the diagram easier to read and understand a total of 32 duplicate variables were used in the final diagram if duplicate or ghost variables are not used in the final cld it becomes more complex due to the mixing of arrows therefore the following duplicate variables were used in the case study cld technical guidance orchard growth electricity cost diesel cost eucalyptus forest growth ditch construction rainfall crop water requirement rainwater harvesting tube well installation industrial growth farmer income land use change soft loans groundwater quality survey evaporation water table depth ploughing advanced irrigation methods salt leaching seepage dams earthen dams and urbanisation as shown in fig 9 b second we defined the complexity of the final cld as the number of input variables attached to the main variable through causal links for example soil salinity is the main variable attached with four input and five output variables thus the level of complexity of the soil salinity variable is four degrees as shown in fig 9 b in step 3 the 22 exogenous variables of the case study cld were identified with the red colour as shown in fig 9 b however only a few are mentioned such as government subsidies advanced irrigation methods groundwater quality survey ploughing temperature and soil fertility in step 4 all highlighted exogenous variables were eliminated with a reduction of about 30 at this stage blind branches were used to eliminate additional variables and avoid confusion about the new generated exogenous variables the process of labelling and eliminating exogenous variables was repeated until the cld became endogenous and no exogenous variables remained in the complex diagram several iterations of the first step may be required to move from the endogenisation to the encapsulation step in step 5 a total of 20 siso variables were identified although only some variables were mentioned such as dams evaporation soft loans and soil fertility after identifying all the siso variables they were removed resulting in a reduction of 25 of the variables as shown in fig 10 a during the elimination of siso variables the polarity links were replaced between the respective variables the polarity links depend upon the number of links and the signum technique was used for this purpose as indicated previously in the sixth step we identified and marked all the sido and diso variables for removal order based reduction to reduce the overall complexity of the cld as shown in fig 10 a a total of 4 sido and diso variables were identified and subsequently eliminated by the order oriented reduction process to simplify the complex cld this process eliminated 5 of the variables from the original merged diagram finally the last step of the eeor process is to improve the system s understandability by establishing loop behaviour the duplicate variables are merged back into the diagram to complete the loops these loops are then numbered and named according to the nature of each loop the complexity of the cld was reduced after the removal of siso sido and diso variables as the process eliminated 46 variables during the simplification the group merged cld lost 60 of its original variables by removing some essential variables loops and processes fig 10 b is the final version diagram obtained via the eeor approach that includes thirty three variables nine loops and five duplicate variables the final version was obtained by removing many variables as per the eeor approach which affected the system integrity and critical feedback processes the final cld showed that surface water availability represents the main variable while stress level farmer income and groundwater pumping were the other significant variables the eeor method also identified several local and more complex critical feedback loops for instance crop water requirements and irrigation requirements represented the local loops while soil salinity growth of salt tolerant crops date planting labour cost farmer income organic fertilisation and reclamation formed a complex reinforcing feedback loop groundwater pumping water table depth and tube well pumping cost formed another balancing feedback loop in the diagram finally the growth of salt tolerant crops sudan gross dairy farming farmer income organic fertilisation and reclamation formed a complex balancing feedback loop it should be noted that the content of the final version of the cld was similar to the content of individual stakeholder cld diagrams but with higher complexity this final version of the diagram was still the product of the group model building based on the perspectives of the eleven people interviewed for validation the diagram in fig 10 b was shared with the original participants for feedback the participants reported that it adequately represented the overall system from their perspectives in this example the remaining mimo variables represented the key concepts that must be considered when considering family life related issues this verification supports the applicability and usability of the eeor method in practice 4 2 thematic maps development the tmd method was also applied to the same case study to simplify a complex cld that included 79 variables 32 duplicate variables and 15 loops of varied nature as shown in fig 9 a the main objective of the tmd method is to enhance the readability of grouped complex diagrams thematic maps are used to divide the complex diagram into sub divided groups according to their respective variables to enhance the understanding of the diagram forrest 2015 it is used to reduce the complexity and divide the final merged cld into thematic sub modules according to the nature of the variables it also interpolates the diagram into different sub groups to provide the best visual representation of the diagram for ease of use in understanding the underlying system structure bier and de souza 2017 using the four steps of the tmd approach the merged cld of the case study was first classified into four thematic sub modules agriculture social and industrial as well as environmental and government govt influence all the variables of the merged cld were classified according to the nature of the defined sub modules the number of variables is shown in fig 11 where they are placed into their respective modules for example the advanced irrigation method belongs to agriculture and is placed into the agriculture sub module similarly evaporation is related to the environmental sub module and ploughing is associated with the government influence sub module whereas the farmer awareness variable is placed in the social sub module each variable of the four thematic sub modules is viewed in its group so the final merged diagram was categorised by different colours and shapes graphically according to the legend as shown in fig 12 likewise the legend is classified based on the nature of the variables the variables of the agricultural thematic sub module are shown in green and red represents the variables of the environmental thematic sub module the variables given a rectangular outline represent the government influence thematic sub module the social and industrial thematic sub module variables are underlined in the second step all overlapping variables were identified and marked overlapping variables are those variables that are common in two or more thematic sub modules for example three overlapping variables in our case study were common to all four sub modules canal lining surface water availability and soil salinity additionally four overlapping variables were common to three sub modules leaching agriculture environmental and govt influence sub module irrigation water quality agriculture govt influence and social and industrial thematic sub modules crop water requirement and crop yield agricultural social industrial and environmental sub modules finally five overlapping variables had two sub modules in common land degradation investment farmer income cropped area agricultural social and industrial thematic sub modules and sulfuric acid application gov influence and environmental thematic sub modules for the third step we identified the loops of the respective thematic sub module before the partition of the merged cld multiple loops were observed in the merged diagram where every thematic sub module had different loops according to their nature as identified in table 1 due to manuscript length only one loop of every thematic module is identified and discussed in detail table 1 lists the loops of every thematic sub module in the model four loops of the different thematic sub modules in the merged cld are represented by the red arrows shown in fig 12 loop one represents the agriculture thematic sub module named the sudan grass loop similarly loop two belongs to the environmental thematic sub module called the irrigation requirement loop the third loop is related to the government influence thematic sub module and is named sulphuric acid application loop the fourth loop is associated with the social and industrial thematic sub module called the urbanisation loop some of the variables in the loop do not belong to the respective thematic sub module but are necessary for loop completion for example the irrigation requirement variable belongs to the social and industrial and the environmental thematic sub modules and is necessary for loop completion hence there is no need to remove this kind of variable however other variables need to be eliminated like the organic fertilisation variable in loop one which does not belong to the respective thematic sub module during the elimination the problem of link polarities was created for example organic fertilisation has two links with positive signs and by multiplying both positive signs the result is positive based on the math multiplication rule additionally even though the organic fertilisation variable is removed the farmer income variable is directly connected with the reclamation loop with a positive sign in the agriculture thematic sub module loop after the partition of the merged diagram this step does not eliminate the single variables or loops but divides the complex cld into different thematic sub modules according to their nature these sub modules when recombined into a single diagram can represent the complete system containing 79 variables 32 duplicate variables and 15 loops without losing any information among the four thematic sub modules the agriculture thematic module was chosen for detailed discussion in this study because it covers an essential physical process that plays a central role in the dynamics of local salinity in the rechna doab pakistan the final version clds of the other thematic sub modules are shown in appendix a b and c 4 2 1 qualitative analysis of the agriculture thematic sub module the agriculture thematic sub module consists of nine significant loops shown in fig 13 including the five sub processes of groundwater water availability reclamation land use and crop yield loop 1 the irrigation requirement loop represents the balancing effect of soil salinity on the irrigation water requirements the increase in soil salinity promotes the growth of salt tolerant crops it increases the growth of eucalyptus which causes reduced crop water requirement thereby increasing surface water supplies by decreasing irrigation water requirement the additional accessible water and improved irrigation water quality percolates the excessive salts reducing the soil salinity as shown in fig 13 loop 2 growth of eucalyptus loop on the other hand an increase in surface water availability increases the cropping intensity and crop season length and there is no available water for soil reclamation fig 13 loop 3 cropping intensity loop this behaviour illustrates the competition between two crops i e agronomic crops and salt tolerant crops the actual behaviour of the system can be shown by the interaction of these two loops with the one loop dominating the other by controlling the availability of the surface water lack of water can damage the fertility of the land and require a change in land use as shown in fig 13 loop 4 land use change land use and soil salinity were joined with time delay functions while changes in land values were not a significant factor due to their wide range of variety and their role in real estate on the other degraded lands farmers can consider the option of orchard or forest growth adopting this option could lead to a significant positive impact on farmer income this income increase through orchard growth or crop yield could help the farmer construct earthen ditches for flood control and rainwater harvesting as shown in fig 13 loop 5 ditch construction some farmers have an issue with the idea of converting the growth of sudan grass and the feasibility of converting agricultural land into dairy farming as shown in fig 13 loop 6 reclamation flood storage and a rainwater harvesting strategy would increase surface water availability decrease groundwater pumping and improve the amount of recharge farmers recommended growing the sudan grass on the highly saline land this practice can promote the development of a local dairy farming industry as shown in fig 13 loop 8 sudan grass growth which also increases farmer incomes canal lining is another option for increasing surface water availability increasing the surface water supply can raise the rice crops growth fig 13 loop 9 rice growth and improve soil leaching efficiency some stakeholders are against the idea of growing sudan grass and raise questions about the feasibility of converting agricultural land to dairy farming both options were mentioned in the model in fig 13 loop 6 reclamation and loop 8 sudan grass growth the area that needs particular attention is the promotion of farmer awareness by technical guidance some stakeholders believed that more resources should be used for awareness campaigns these campaigns could lead to farmers changing their behaviour and adopting technological measures e g advanced irrigation thus helping to improve crop yields fig 13 loop 5 ditch construction other stakeholders indicated that the main hurdle to adopting new technologies was the large number of smaller land holdings they also described the need for technical guidance for rainwater harvesting receiving government subsidies and reclamation techniques the government needs to execute initiatives for social awareness for capability building and measures to transfer power to stakeholders the comprehensive merged model includes three more thematic sub modules addressing the system s government influence social and industrial and environmental aspects however as mentioned earlier only the agriculture thematic sub module is discussed here 4 3 comparison of eeor and tmd methods this research explored two methods to simplify final merged clds and compared both methods with the help of a case study in rechna doab pakistan it should be noted that the current study is only related to qualitative modelling without considering quantitative modelling the first approach assessed was the eeor method which simplifies the merged cld in seven steps and the second approach assessed was the tmd method which has four steps for eeor in each of the seven steps we removed diagram variables like mimo siso sido and diso and made the diagram simpler at each step the procedure for simplification is not straightforward since variables are removed at each step to simplify the diagram without knowing the importance of the respective variable there are various limitations found in this method bureš 2017 removing variables in this manner may result in the loss of critical information and other feedback processes within the system leading to a loss in overall system integrity a total of 47 variables such as mimo siso sido and diso were excluded to simplify the complex cld for example 22 exogenous variables were labelled and removed which constitutes almost 30 of the variables of the merged cld without setting proper criteria as shown in fig 9 b in another step 24 siso sido and diso variables were labelled and removed which again constitutes around 30 of the variables as shown in fig 10 a due to the removal of around 60 of the variables many vital processes and loops were eliminated disturbing the system s integrity despite this limitation in the absence of other simplification methods the eeor method is still a good initial step for simplifying complex diagrams the second approach is the tmd method which was compared for the first time in this manuscript with the eeor method the tmd method is used to simplify complex hard to understand clds this simplification takes place in four steps in this method we divided the final merged cld into several thematic sub modules such as agriculture environmental social and industrial and government subsidies according to the variables type and nature each sub module represented its system and feedback process different variables were present in the final merged cld but they were placed into their respective thematic sub modules after partition making the cld easier to visualise since every variable was classified into respective sub modules e g all variables and loops related to the agriculture theme are placed into the agricultural thematic sub module this type of partition can increase understanding and enhance individual stakeholder engagement each stakeholder focused only on a relevant thematic sub module rather than the entire model there was no danger of the removal of critical variables and information from the diagram therefore this method maintained the integrity of the system the tmd final step divided the diagram and all the thematic sub modules were reconnected through the common variables and represented in the final merged cld the final cld included the complete set of variables 79 variables 32 duplicate variables and 15 loops this method maintained the critical loops and feedback processes and no information was lost applying the tmd method can help researchers visually present small easy to understand sub models to stakeholders for greater engagement and better insight into the system under consideration 5 conclusion complexity is a problem in many research disciplines and system dynamics is not an exception modelling complex phenomena is a complicated process and any tool that can help make sense of the complexity can aid our understanding of the modelled system even though stakeholder engagement in decision making is a priority in practice it is demanding to carry out due to the difficulty of understanding the modelled system processes two types of diagrams are predominant in system dynamics modelling stock and flow diagrams and causal loop diagrams this study seeked to address some of the difficulties that arise from using large combined group clds where the complexity is increased due to many variables and relationships between them this study compared two methods for simplifying complex clds the eeor and tmd methods the applied case study verified both methods applicability using a merged cld that included 79 variables 32 duplicate variables and 15 different loops the eeor method is iterative and grounded in three activities endogenisation encapsulation and order oriented based reduction in eeor 46 variables and 6 loops were removed from the complex integrated cld the final simplified cld lost 60 of its original form due to the removal of variables simplification using this method may in some cases lead to losing important information and feedback processes hence it may adversely affect the integrity of the system being investigated the tmd method can be used effectively to reduce the complexity of clds in this method the final complex cld was divided into different sub modules based on the variables nature and the diagram s requirement in our case study four thematic sub modules i e environment agriculture social and industrial and government subsidies were defined this separation allowed the modeller to evaluate the details of different aspects of the system simplification using the tmd method enables one to critically evaluate and focus on the system s relevant aspects during stakeholder discussions thus the sub modules can be recombined to produce the same initial complex cld yet maintain system integrity and retain critical information and feedback processes compared to the eeor method the thematic model approach also supports model quantification in later stages by providing help in understanding system structure however the tmd method resulted in interaction loss between different system aspects due to the removal exclusion of feedback loops despite these limitations the

24264,complex systems are generally challenging to model due to many variables whose relationships and dependencies are often difficult and time consuming to comprehend simplifying complex systems can remove barriers to adaptation and application by marginalized stakeholders the main aim of the proposed research is to compare two simplification methods i e endogenisation encapsulation and order oriented reduction eeor and thematic maps development tmd in terms of maintaining system integrity a case study was conducted in the rechna doab region of pakistan this was a qualitative system dynamics model study which included 79 variables 32 duplicate or ghost variables and 15 loops eeor simplifies causal loop diagrams clds by removing exogenous variables and adjusting loops in successive steps in this study eeor eliminated 46 variables and 6 critical feedback loops during the simplification of the complex case study cld and did not maintain the system s integrity the main risk of this technique is eliminating variables without understanding their significance accordingly despite the goal of a better understanding eeor led to a loss of 60 of the final merged cld tmd divided the final integrated case study cld into four thematic sub modules agriculture environmental social and industrial and government subsidies each variable and loop were placed in their respective thematic sub modules this separation enhanced the understanding and evaluation of individual thematic sub modules when recombined into a single diagram these sub modules were able to represent the entire system without losing any information this research can help to simplify complex system models to help system understanding by novice stakeholders while maintaining the integrity of the system consequently this simplification approach can help further increase stakeholder engagement in participatory modelling exercises keywords causal loop diagram participatory modeling soil

communication gap between stakeholders and supports adaptive management during the implementation of a policy or an intervention clare et al 2017 jones 2019 successful stakeholder engagement depends on the effective involvement of participants throughout the data collection and design process to capture their requirements jones 2019 various data acquisition methods are used to obtain stakeholders views such as pattern it mediated modelling php5 and causal loop diagrams clds belt 2004 devine wright 2020 mallery et al 2012 williams and hummelbrunner 2010 among these approaches pattern it mediated modelling and php5 are used to graphically capture data from stakeholder workshops to improve the understanding of a ses through a model however the graphical representation of these approaches is quite complex restricting some participants from contributing to the model alternatively clds can offer a more straightforward and easier to use graphical approach to enhance the understanding and analysis of complex systems perrone et al 2020 1 1 causal loop diagrams clds using clds can highlight the main variables and the cause and effect relationships between them that can reflect stakeholder s mental models which consist of variables and causal links with positive or negative polarity schaffernicht 2010 causal links join the independent variables to dependent variables by using positive or negative polarities linking the positive or negative multi variables with causal links produces feedback loops that indicate the ultimate effect of an action on a variable problem a positive polarity indicates the direct impact of the independent variable on the dependent variable williams and hummelbrunner 2010 for example if the cause increases the effect will also increase or if the cause decreases then the effect will also decrease alternatively a negative polarity indicates the inverse effect between independent and dependent variables i e if the cause escalates the effect will decrease or if the cause decreases then the effect will increase higgins 2013 clds are a flexible practical set of feedback driven tools for qualitative system analysis inam et al 2015 that can potentially play an important role in helping to resolve social economic issues through system modelling seki et al 2020 clds have been effectively utilised in various applications ranging from business management public health education policy water management planning and management and sustainable natural resources management inam et al 2017 kazak et al 2019 sahin et al 2020 in addition clds have been used in taxation finance management and other applications seki et al 2020 these diagrams are particularly useful in investigating the original feedback structures of a system and can help capture a problem variable s dynamic nature malard et al 2017 clds have long been used in system dynamics modeling to clarify relationships between variables in simulation models they have beenused in community based participatory modelling for sustainable management in agriculture and food security herrera 2018 clds can facilitate stakeholders discussions on the boundaries of the simulation model and focus on the mechanism of the problem behaviour and the critical components of the system under investigation herrera and kopainsky 2020 however clds have particular challenges that may complicate diagrams and result in a reduced understanding of the model particularly among those using the approach for the first time one of the most significant issues in the process is when all individual participant clds are merged into a single group cld diagram since this may result in a complicated diagram that is too complicated unclear for some stakeholders and does not contribute to greater understanding inam et al 2015 furthermore merging all the loops and variables can sometimes create a very complex cld diagram that can lead to confusion defeating one of the main purposes of using clds in the first place bureš 2017 moreover such complex clds can result in over complicated system dynamics models i e quantified models which are not necessarily a better outcome as this does not necessarily contribute to a greater understanding of the system curzio and fortis 2012 sometimes too many details can distract the focus from important points and can add unnecessary costs and delays to the project bureš 2017 elmaraghy et al 2012 additionally novice stakeholders may not be able to effectively contribute to the process as the complexity of the system increases viana 2017 workshop participants can sometimes lose interest in a modelling exercise if large and cumbersome clds or sd models are shared with them frannek et al 2016 1 2 cld simplification approaches accordingly any approach that can simplify clds and still capture diverse stakeholder views for a better understanding of systemic issues is useful there are different simplification methods for complex clds in the literature such as edge bundling folding the network indicated feedback loops and colouring allender et al 2015 du et al 2010 eberlein 1989 yao et al 2015 edge bundling is a technique for simplifying network diagrams by spotting the diagram s edge to make it bundle to eliminate visual clutter yao et al 2015 various studies have discussed the application of the edge bundling technique ellis and dix 2007 gansner et al 2011 holten and van wijk 2009 it does not simplify the diagram s processes for understanding rather it improves the graphical representation based on spotting at the diagram s edge apart from this folding the network is another approach to enhance diagram simplicity by replacing variables from one point to another but it may also remove essential system processes du et al 2010 some researchers have successfully implemented the folding strategy in various research fields costa et al 2007 xiao et al 2008 xuan and wu 2009 alternatively eberlein 1989 describes a theory to increase model simplification in terms of indicating the essential feedback loops in the linearised model according to selected dynamic behaviour eberlein 1989 this theory highlights the significance of drawing the clds digitally and supports the correct positioning of the loops in the system several suggested articles have utilised this approach to simplify feedback loop procedures davison 1966 eberlein 1989 eberlein and hines 1987 however this approach may impact the system s integrity and lead to incorrect outcomes finally colouring is a community based approach that simplifies the diagram by colour coding according to themes allender et al 2015 depending on the variables in the diagram different colours are applied to the complex cld throughout the process each variable type has a different colour which enables a clear representation of the diagram various scientific studies have used this approach to improve the visualisation of complex diagrams allender et al 2015 finegood et al 2010 hammond 2009 king et al 2011 although the complexity of the diagram remains unresolved colouring may significantly improve its readability and help divide the diagrams content into more straightforward and easy to understand sections the above approaches and their limitations demonstrate the significant research gap that this paper aims to address policies and interventions designed to address specific problems risk failing if relevant stakeholders views and opinions are not taken into account clare et al 2017 stakeholder groups that have traditionally been marginalized in decision making processes may decline to participate in participatory processes if complex and difficult to interpret clds are presented to them in interactions and workshop activities inam et al 2017 thus a better approach to simplify complex multi stakeholder clds is required for more meaningful stakeholder engagement that can translate into greater participation improved understanding and capturing of the mental maps of stakeholders and better integration of the perspectives of stakeholders in the policy making process for effective stakeholder engagement an overall picture and a small model are preferred for clarity allowing for a better understanding of a system forrester 2007 despite the need for clarity there is a lack of potential methods for simplifying a final merged cld consequently we compare two techniques to simplify clds the first is the eeor method and the second is the thematic maps development tmd method explored here for the first time these two strategies both seek to address the level of complexity of the diagram 1 3 endogenisation encapsulation and order oriented reduction eeor method the eeor technique consists of seven steps bures 2017 i use duplicate variables to prevent the crossing of linked relationships ii define the level of the complexity of the whole system under consideration iii identify and label all exogenous variables iv eliminate all selected exogenous variables endogenisation v label and then eliminate single input and single output variables siso and replace the links encapsulation vi label and then eliminate single input double output sido or double input single output diso variables order oriented reduction and vii number and name the loops to establish loop behaviour the eeor technique reduces the complexity of the group cld however it can in some cases also lead to the loss of important information variables loops and the system s integrity during the simplification process bureš 2017 1 4 thematic maps development tmd method the tmd method explored in this research can reduce the complexity of a cld while maintaining the system s integrity halbe 2009 inam et al 2015 the tmd method includes the following four steps i classification of the variables according to their nature i e social physical environmental etc ii identification and marking of overlapping variables that are common to one or more modules iii identification and labelling of loops to avoid mixing the variables during the removal process and iv reduction which involves dividing the complex cld into different sub modules as per the nature of the cld being considered such as agricultural environmental governmental social and economic models halbe 2009 inam et al 2015 partitioning a system into such sub modules or dimensions has also been considered beneficial in other contexts such as community disaster resilience at the local level to encourage stakeholder participation and engagement tariq et al 2021 such a separation allows for the details of the different aspects of the problem to be evaluated separately simplifying the model structure for future uses such as in the case of quantification it should be noted that the thematic sub models are still linked with each other by their common variables and no vital information or detail is lost thus maintaining the system s integrity the tmd method is designed to improve upon previous methods in the literature it combines elements from other approaches to allow for the simplification across topical dimensions of an ses that can be separated colour coded and collapsed expanded according to the context of its use hence the tmd method has the potential to simplify clds and can focus discussions in workshops on the dimensions or aspects of the problem considered by stakeholders individually as well as combined and result in more accessible and easier to read and use clds for more meaningful stakeholder engagement this paper compares both methods i e eeor and tmd to explore which one might be better suited to simplifying complex clds in a case study of soil salinity in the rechna doab basin in pakistan this research should be helpful to other researchers working in the fields of stakeholder engagement system dynamics and social ecological systems the case study uses data from previous research conducted by some of the co authors of this paper on the development of clds for soil salinity in the rechna doab basin of pakistan inam et al 2015 and builds on this previous research by applying the eeor and tmd methods the paper is organised as follows section 1 looked at several existing simplification techniques section 2 covers the study area in detail the details of the simplification approaches is discussed in section 3 and section 4 summarizes the results and provides a comparison of the two strategies while section 5 concludes with the significant findings and potential future work 2 study area the cld modelling study was conducted for the rechna doab basin pakistan to compare the two simplification methods the research area is located between two rivers making it more complex and resulting in a wide range of hydrological conditions inam et al 2015 due to variations in hydrological conditions this region has been well researched and is suitable for use in modelling exercises the area of the rechna doab translated locally as the land between two rivers is situated at the coordinates 30 37 28 n and 71 49 19 e and is located under the haveli canal command downstream of pakistan s ravi and chenab rivers shown in fig 1 it is situated at the inter fluvial basin of both rivers covering roughly 732 50 k m 2 the area is potentially cultivable land although 30 of the area is presently fallow due to high soil salinity levels rehman et al 1997 the mean size of the region s landholdings is 3 85ha inam et al 2015 due to the lack of surface water supply 75 of farmers use groundwater of marginal quality in the area rehman et al 1997 groundwater depth varies from 3 6 m with groundwater electrolyte concentrations beyond 1500 ppm in the middle portion of the basin in contrast the use of marginal quality groundwater has made the area salt affected better policies and good management practices could potentially reclaim this area according to estimates 26 2 of the total irrigated area of pakistan is saline but nearly 70 of this area is only moderately saline and can potentially be reclaimed kazmi et al 2012 it is a well documented region with many studies collecting field recorded data over a long period since the early 1960s many government organisations have actively monitored water table depths water quality and soil salinity in the region i e wapda irrigation department and land reclamation department inam et al 2015 3 methodology the eeor and tmd methods were applied to the study area one by one to address the complexity of the cld first the seven steps of the eeor method were applied to simplify a complex cld which is explained with a generic example below next the tmd method was used similarly to simplify a complex cld tmd is introduced here for the first time in this context and section 4 discusses its application in detail using diagrams in section 4 3 a comparison of the methods is provided including a discussion of the advantages and limitations 3 1 eeor method endogenisation encapsulation and order oriented reduction eeor method is used to simplify complex clds bureš 2017 the flowchart in fig 2 illustrates the step wise implementation of the eeor method based on the approach of bures 2017 a cld is a qualitative model used to study system processes and is based on capturing the many endogenous exogenous and auxiliary variables present in a system merged or group clds are more complex and are developed by combining individual stakeholder clds or combining all individual variables recorded during group stakeholder interviews schaffernicht 2010 when all these variables and stakeholder information are linked together in one cld diagram the diagram becomes more complex group clds join all these variables and can be classified into four possible configurations these are multi system input and multi system output mimo single input single output siso double input single output diso and single input double output sido variables as shown in fig 3 mimo variables are those which form the system structure and considerably impact system performance conroy and gupta 2015 in the first step the reduction may be performed from the least complex to more complex model components such as siso variable to diso and sido variables the degree of relative reduction entire cld complexity vs the highest order of eliminated variables is quite similar at all stages of complexity endogenisation is a process which identifies and removes all input and output system mimo variables in the encapsulation method all siso variables are labelled and removed simultaneously the last order based reduction step should be performed by eliminating diso and sido variables respectively the three critical processes endogenisation encapsulation and order based reduction are arranged according to their impact on system integrity if endogenisation can be done it should be completed before considering encapsulation likewise if encapsulation can be done then it must be performed instead of reduction the eeor method was divided into seven steps according to the order of the above three techniques to simplify the complex merged diagrams as the complexity of the clds will be reduced principally in an iterative manner the structures used as generic examples are described below for a better understanding as shown in fig 4 5 bureš 2017 3 1 1 using duplicate variables to construct a diagram complex clds consist of many variables and are very difficult to draw without the intersection of single links the understandability of the cld can generally be improved by using duplicate or so called ghost variables bureš 2017 if these duplicate variables are utilised they should be used as inputs to other variables using these ghost variables in this manner can reduce the complexity of the cld at the start of the process the number of ghost or duplicate variables such as stress level addictions and living space is encircled in the generic example as shown in fig 4 a the number of duplicate variables is reduced when these variables are replaced or removed 3 1 2 defining the level of complexity cld complexity can be described in different ways large grouped clds are often challenging to interpret because of their graphical complexity and hence might not achieve their stated purpose i e helping understand the system processes for deeper insight inam et al 2015 the level of cld complexity depends upon the number of loops attached to each variable hence the more mimo variables in the cld the greater the complexity fig 3 a shows that groundwater depletion is connected with mimo variables the level of complexity can be shown as follows 1 y f x 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 where y represents the independent variable named groundwater depletion and x1 x2 x3 and x4 denote dependent function variables such as recharge discharge life cycle crop yield water availability etc bures 2017 if y changes the value of dependent variables also changes as does the whole function which increases the complexity of the model this additional level of complexity makes it challenging to explain how much input variables affect the independent variable in the model and how much the output variables change in response making the clds harder to understand and use with stakeholders in contrast fig 3 b shows a simple system with a siso that is more straightforward to discuss with stakeholders enhancing the model s applicability and making it more effective for stakeholder engagement if the number of siso variables is greater than the number of mimo variables in the diagram the system becomes less complex and easier to understand on the other hand if the number of mimo variables is greater than the number of siso variables the system becomes more complex and harder to understand 3 1 3 labelling of all exogenous variables a large proportion of model variables are typically exogenous variables exogenous variables are those whose value is decided outside the model s boundary thus any change in a model due to outside factors results from these exogenous variables richardson 2011 these variables must be noted so that essential information is not lost during the simplification process in our generic example the exogenous variables are encircled such as pets economic threats the density of cars quality of residential life space sexual life parent s problem workload and the number of vehicles as shown in fig 4 b they will be eliminated in the next step 3 1 4 eliminate all selected variables endogenisation all exogenous variables must be identified before their elimination it is suggested to eliminate all variables in one step to avoid confusion caused by any new exogenous variables that could be generated as a product of this step blind branches describe the cause and effect relationship between exogenous variables part of the branch and other subsequent variables not connected to a feedback loop blind branches can be used to increase the speed of this step as well every blind branch ends in a variable that is a section of the feedback loop bureš 2017 finally we remove all the selected exogenous variables as shown in fig 4 c 3 1 5 label then eliminate siso variables and replace the links encapsulation once exogenous variables are erased the system behaviour is fully described by its structure sterman 2000 siso variables represent the transformation elements that induce change in the system dynamics from one point to another which can then be replaced by a structural change in the model mcglashan et al 2016 again in our model example we identify and encircle all siso variables such as work certainty irritation and responsibility as shown in fig 4 d and eliminate all these variables to see the resultant diagram in fig 5 a two issues must be noted during this phase first any new link polarities must be defined the new link polarity depends on the system s total number of negative polarities the signum technique can be used for this task as it results in only two values 0 or 1 to explain the type of link polarity bureš 2017 s second this method will remove any local feedback in which only two variables are included 3 1 6 label and then eliminate sido or diso variables order based reduction after the encapsulation process when all exogenous and siso variables disappear it is recommended to identify all sido and diso variables for example in fig 5 b variables like happiness health communication and arguments make the diagram more complex simultaneously eliminating all these variables can simplify the diagram as represented in fig 5 c thus the elimination process is completed according to order based reduction and the remaining final diagram is shown in fig 5 d 3 1 7 behavior of established loops the duplicate variables are then eventually merged in this step the feedback loops are given a name and numbered and their behaviour is established the resulting diagram is much simpler than the original ones final diagram shown in fig 5 d it concisely represents critical system feedback processes there are two feedback loops found in this respective diagram for example in loop 2 only three variables are needed to describe the dynamic process of that loop in our generic example 3 2 thematic maps development thematic maps show information about the relationship of a particular subject with another subject inam et al 2015 it represents the spatial distribution of an identifiable variable and provides an informational description of an area rather than data in detail perrone et al 2020 the tmd approach divides the merged clds into thematic sub modules showing the whole system s environmental social economic governance and agricultural components and any other modules defined by the research question this method classifies all the variables into thematic sub models according to the nature of the variable consequently this type of partition helps consider the information of various dimensions in isolation from other variables it also helps simplify the model structure for future estimation purposes for example the thematic sub module of agriculture only deals with the respective variables with the same units while the social sub module deals with variables such as change in migration and industrialisation the variables of the environmental thematic sub module for example groundwater quality irrigation and wastewater production describe the varying conditions of the environment due to soil salinity and the economic sub module considers the role of government subsidies for canal lining and modern irrigation techniques these thematic sub modules of complex causal loop diagrams can be connected with a common variable the tmd technique is used to simplify the complexity of diagrams in four steps as shown in fig 6 an example from our case study demonstrates the four steps of the technique 3 2 1 classification of variables in the first step we indicate and mark all variables according to their respective disciplines after marking all variables they are arranged into thematic sub modules different colours mark the variables to represent their respective thematic sub modules shown in fig 7 a for example the orchard growth variable is green indicating it is only related to the thematic sub module of agriculture the evaporation variable which can only be related to the environmental sub module is written in blue similarly every variable is placed into the four different thematic sub modules based on their nature 3 2 2 overlapping variable after the classification of variables the next important step is to mark the overlapping variables to maintain the integrity of the cld until it is decomposed into thematic sub modules overlapping variables are those in the cld that are common to all or some thematic sub modules and help connect the thematic sub modules the diagram s partition into thematic sub models becomes impossible without identifying the overlapping variables for example in our case study canal lining surface water availability and soil salinity are the overlapping variables common in all sub modules as shown in fig 7 the next step is identifying the loop shown in fig 7 b 3 2 3 identification of loops the next step is to identify the nature of loops according to the respective variables in this section it is essential to point out the loops and their respective variable type such as environmental agricultural government influence social and economic thematic sub modules after identifying these loops with their respective variables we can eliminate the remaining variables without losing crucial information and leave only those considered for insight and understanding this step results in selected loops of each sub module being included in the complex diagram which can be shown according to stakeholder desire or focus in this paper we focus on the agriculture sub module as an example other sub modules follow the same process but are omitted for brevity fig 7 b shows the identification of loops and variables of the agriculture thematic sub module and the arrows in red colour represent the loop of the respective thematic sub module three loops are identified and all other variables are eliminated in the next step during loop identification some variables are not related to the respective thematic sub module but are present in the loop as they are necessary for the loop completion of the sub module 3 2 4 reduction after identifying the loop the next process is partitioning the diagram into different thematic sub modules and eliminating variables of other disciplines that are not of interest the shadow or ghost variables are eventually merged into loops in this section these loops are completed for each sub module and are named according to the loop discipline all the loops of the sub modules are arranged by a given number and feedback loop process as examples the final versions of the agricultural and environmental thematic sub modules are shown in fig 8 for brevity only two sub modules are illustrated here it should be noted that all these thematic sub modules are connected through common or overlapping variables 4 results and discussion the two methods eeor and tmd discussed in the previous sections can each be employed to simplify any complex cld the development of group clds for modelling purposes has been widely used in many disciplines scott et al 2016 clds have become important in participatory systems modelling since the mid 1980s andersen and richardson 1997 peck 1998 various limitations of group modelling have been discussed in many studies e g andersen et al 2007 richardson 2013 rouwette et al 2011 however clds still represent a valuable tool for graphically showing relationships which can be improved by simplifying the methods shown in this study the following section demonstrates their applicability and validates the two methods with the help of a case study taken from a previous study conducted by several of the authors the case study was conducted in the rechna doab region of pakistan focusing on qualitative modelling through stakeholder built clds to address the problem of soil salinity and its management policies in the basin the original case study group cld was developed by merging all individual cld diagrams of eleven stakeholders into one group merged cld diagram inam et al 2015 as shown in fig 9 a this group built cld diagram contained 79 variables 32 duplicate variables and 15 different loops the diagrams were redrawn in the vensim software package ple version used for the modelling and simulation of system dynamics in the present study two methods were applied to the case study for cld simplification the eeor method and the tmd method the following sections discuss and compare both approaches including the advantages and limitations of each finally based on the case study results we recommend the best method for simplifying a complex cld 4 1 eeor endogenisation encapsulation and order oriented based reduction the eeor method is used first to simplify the complex final group cld in the case study eeor method follows a seven step process as discussed in the methodology section first the duplicate variables were used to reduce cross arrow links making the diagram easier to read and understand a total of 32 duplicate variables were used in the final diagram if duplicate or ghost variables are not used in the final cld it becomes more complex due to the mixing of arrows therefore the following duplicate variables were used in the case study cld technical guidance orchard growth electricity cost diesel cost eucalyptus forest growth ditch construction rainfall crop water requirement rainwater harvesting tube well installation industrial growth farmer income land use change soft loans groundwater quality survey evaporation water table depth ploughing advanced irrigation methods salt leaching seepage dams earthen dams and urbanisation as shown in fig 9 b second we defined the complexity of the final cld as the number of input variables attached to the main variable through causal links for example soil salinity is the main variable attached with four input and five output variables thus the level of complexity of the soil salinity variable is four degrees as shown in fig 9 b in step 3 the 22 exogenous variables of the case study cld were identified with the red colour as shown in fig 9 b however only a few are mentioned such as government subsidies advanced irrigation methods groundwater quality survey ploughing temperature and soil fertility in step 4 all highlighted exogenous variables were eliminated with a reduction of about 30 at this stage blind branches were used to eliminate additional variables and avoid confusion about the new generated exogenous variables the process of labelling and eliminating exogenous variables was repeated until the cld became endogenous and no exogenous variables remained in the complex diagram several iterations of the first step may be required to move from the endogenisation to the encapsulation step in step 5 a total of 20 siso variables were identified although only some variables were mentioned such as dams evaporation soft loans and soil fertility after identifying all the siso variables they were removed resulting in a reduction of 25 of the variables as shown in fig 10 a during the elimination of siso variables the polarity links were replaced between the respective variables the polarity links depend upon the number of links and the signum technique was used for this purpose as indicated previously in the sixth step we identified and marked all the sido and diso variables for removal order based reduction to reduce the overall complexity of the cld as shown in fig 10 a a total of 4 sido and diso variables were identified and subsequently eliminated by the order oriented reduction process to simplify the complex cld this process eliminated 5 of the variables from the original merged diagram finally the last step of the eeor process is to improve the system s understandability by establishing loop behaviour the duplicate variables are merged back into the diagram to complete the loops these loops are then numbered and named according to the nature of each loop the complexity of the cld was reduced after the removal of siso sido and diso variables as the process eliminated 46 variables during the simplification the group merged cld lost 60 of its original variables by removing some essential variables loops and processes fig 10 b is the final version diagram obtained via the eeor approach that includes thirty three variables nine loops and five duplicate variables the final version was obtained by removing many variables as per the eeor approach which affected the system integrity and critical feedback processes the final cld showed that surface water availability represents the main variable while stress level farmer income and groundwater pumping were the other significant variables the eeor method also identified several local and more complex critical feedback loops for instance crop water requirements and irrigation requirements represented the local loops while soil salinity growth of salt tolerant crops date planting labour cost farmer income organic fertilisation and reclamation formed a complex reinforcing feedback loop groundwater pumping water table depth and tube well pumping cost formed another balancing feedback loop in the diagram finally the growth of salt tolerant crops sudan gross dairy farming farmer income organic fertilisation and reclamation formed a complex balancing feedback loop it should be noted that the content of the final version of the cld was similar to the content of individual stakeholder cld diagrams but with higher complexity this final version of the diagram was still the product of the group model building based on the perspectives of the eleven people interviewed for validation the diagram in fig 10 b was shared with the original participants for feedback the participants reported that it adequately represented the overall system from their perspectives in this example the remaining mimo variables represented the key concepts that must be considered when considering family life related issues this verification supports the applicability and usability of the eeor method in practice 4 2 thematic maps development the tmd method was also applied to the same case study to simplify a complex cld that included 79 variables 32 duplicate variables and 15 loops of varied nature as shown in fig 9 a the main objective of the tmd method is to enhance the readability of grouped complex diagrams thematic maps are used to divide the complex diagram into sub divided groups according to their respective variables to enhance the understanding of the diagram forrest 2015 it is used to reduce the complexity and divide the final merged cld into thematic sub modules according to the nature of the variables it also interpolates the diagram into different sub groups to provide the best visual representation of the diagram for ease of use in understanding the underlying system structure bier and de souza 2017 using the four steps of the tmd approach the merged cld of the case study was first classified into four thematic sub modules agriculture social and industrial as well as environmental and government govt influence all the variables of the merged cld were classified according to the nature of the defined sub modules the number of variables is shown in fig 11 where they are placed into their respective modules for example the advanced irrigation method belongs to agriculture and is placed into the agriculture sub module similarly evaporation is related to the environmental sub module and ploughing is associated with the government influence sub module whereas the farmer awareness variable is placed in the social sub module each variable of the four thematic sub modules is viewed in its group so the final merged diagram was categorised by different colours and shapes graphically according to the legend as shown in fig 12 likewise the legend is classified based on the nature of the variables the variables of the agricultural thematic sub module are shown in green and red represents the variables of the environmental thematic sub module the variables given a rectangular outline represent the government influence thematic sub module the social and industrial thematic sub module variables are underlined in the second step all overlapping variables were identified and marked overlapping variables are those variables that are common in two or more thematic sub modules for example three overlapping variables in our case study were common to all four sub modules canal lining surface water availability and soil salinity additionally four overlapping variables were common to three sub modules leaching agriculture environmental and govt influence sub module irrigation water quality agriculture govt influence and social and industrial thematic sub modules crop water requirement and crop yield agricultural social industrial and environmental sub modules finally five overlapping variables had two sub modules in common land degradation investment farmer income cropped area agricultural social and industrial thematic sub modules and sulfuric acid application gov influence and environmental thematic sub modules for the third step we identified the loops of the respective thematic sub module before the partition of the merged cld multiple loops were observed in the merged diagram where every thematic sub module had different loops according to their nature as identified in table 1 due to manuscript length only one loop of every thematic module is identified and discussed in detail table 1 lists the loops of every thematic sub module in the model four loops of the different thematic sub modules in the merged cld are represented by the red arrows shown in fig 12 loop one represents the agriculture thematic sub module named the sudan grass loop similarly loop two belongs to the environmental thematic sub module called the irrigation requirement loop the third loop is related to the government influence thematic sub module and is named sulphuric acid application loop the fourth loop is associated with the social and industrial thematic sub module called the urbanisation loop some of the variables in the loop do not belong to the respective thematic sub module but are necessary for loop completion for example the irrigation requirement variable belongs to the social and industrial and the environmental thematic sub modules and is necessary for loop completion hence there is no need to remove this kind of variable however other variables need to be eliminated like the organic fertilisation variable in loop one which does not belong to the respective thematic sub module during the elimination the problem of link polarities was created for example organic fertilisation has two links with positive signs and by multiplying both positive signs the result is positive based on the math multiplication rule additionally even though the organic fertilisation variable is removed the farmer income variable is directly connected with the reclamation loop with a positive sign in the agriculture thematic sub module loop after the partition of the merged diagram this step does not eliminate the single variables or loops but divides the complex cld into different thematic sub modules according to their nature these sub modules when recombined into a single diagram can represent the complete system containing 79 variables 32 duplicate variables and 15 loops without losing any information among the four thematic sub modules the agriculture thematic module was chosen for detailed discussion in this study because it covers an essential physical process that plays a central role in the dynamics of local salinity in the rechna doab pakistan the final version clds of the other thematic sub modules are shown in appendix a b and c 4 2 1 qualitative analysis of the agriculture thematic sub module the agriculture thematic sub module consists of nine significant loops shown in fig 13 including the five sub processes of groundwater water availability reclamation land use and crop yield loop 1 the irrigation requirement loop represents the balancing effect of soil salinity on the irrigation water requirements the increase in soil salinity promotes the growth of salt tolerant crops it increases the growth of eucalyptus which causes reduced crop water requirement thereby increasing surface water supplies by decreasing irrigation water requirement the additional accessible water and improved irrigation water quality percolates the excessive salts reducing the soil salinity as shown in fig 13 loop 2 growth of eucalyptus loop on the other hand an increase in surface water availability increases the cropping intensity and crop season length and there is no available water for soil reclamation fig 13 loop 3 cropping intensity loop this behaviour illustrates the competition between two crops i e agronomic crops and salt tolerant crops the actual behaviour of the system can be shown by the interaction of these two loops with the one loop dominating the other by controlling the availability of the surface water lack of water can damage the fertility of the land and require a change in land use as shown in fig 13 loop 4 land use change land use and soil salinity were joined with time delay functions while changes in land values were not a significant factor due to their wide range of variety and their role in real estate on the other degraded lands farmers can consider the option of orchard or forest growth adopting this option could lead to a significant positive impact on farmer income this income increase through orchard growth or crop yield could help the farmer construct earthen ditches for flood control and rainwater harvesting as shown in fig 13 loop 5 ditch construction some farmers have an issue with the idea of converting the growth of sudan grass and the feasibility of converting agricultural land into dairy farming as shown in fig 13 loop 6 reclamation flood storage and a rainwater harvesting strategy would increase surface water availability decrease groundwater pumping and improve the amount of recharge farmers recommended growing the sudan grass on the highly saline land this practice can promote the development of a local dairy farming industry as shown in fig 13 loop 8 sudan grass growth which also increases farmer incomes canal lining is another option for increasing surface water availability increasing the surface water supply can raise the rice crops growth fig 13 loop 9 rice growth and improve soil leaching efficiency some stakeholders are against the idea of growing sudan grass and raise questions about the feasibility of converting agricultural land to dairy farming both options were mentioned in the model in fig 13 loop 6 reclamation and loop 8 sudan grass growth the area that needs particular attention is the promotion of farmer awareness by technical guidance some stakeholders believed that more resources should be used for awareness campaigns these campaigns could lead to farmers changing their behaviour and adopting technological measures e g advanced irrigation thus helping to improve crop yields fig 13 loop 5 ditch construction other stakeholders indicated that the main hurdle to adopting new technologies was the large number of smaller land holdings they also described the need for technical guidance for rainwater harvesting receiving government subsidies and reclamation techniques the government needs to execute initiatives for social awareness for capability building and measures to transfer power to stakeholders the comprehensive merged model includes three more thematic sub modules addressing the system s government influence social and industrial and environmental aspects however as mentioned earlier only the agriculture thematic sub module is discussed here 4 3 comparison of eeor and tmd methods this research explored two methods to simplify final merged clds and compared both methods with the help of a case study in rechna doab pakistan it should be noted that the current study is only related to qualitative modelling without considering quantitative modelling the first approach assessed was the eeor method which simplifies the merged cld in seven steps and the second approach assessed was the tmd method which has four steps for eeor in each of the seven steps we removed diagram variables like mimo siso sido and diso and made the diagram simpler at each step the procedure for simplification is not straightforward since variables are removed at each step to simplify the diagram without knowing the importance of the respective variable there are various limitations found in this method bureš 2017 removing variables in this manner may result in the loss of critical information and other feedback processes within the system leading to a loss in overall system integrity a total of 47 variables such as mimo siso sido and diso were excluded to simplify the complex cld for example 22 exogenous variables were labelled and removed which constitutes almost 30 of the variables of the merged cld without setting proper criteria as shown in fig 9 b in another step 24 siso sido and diso variables were labelled and removed which again constitutes around 30 of the variables as shown in fig 10 a due to the removal of around 60 of the variables many vital processes and loops were eliminated disturbing the system s integrity despite this limitation in the absence of other simplification methods the eeor method is still a good initial step for simplifying complex diagrams the second approach is the tmd method which was compared for the first time in this manuscript with the eeor method the tmd method is used to simplify complex hard to understand clds this simplification takes place in four steps in this method we divided the final merged cld into several thematic sub modules such as agriculture environmental social and industrial and government subsidies according to the variables type and nature each sub module represented its system and feedback process different variables were present in the final merged cld but they were placed into their respective thematic sub modules after partition making the cld easier to visualise since every variable was classified into respective sub modules e g all variables and loops related to the agriculture theme are placed into the agricultural thematic sub module this type of partition can increase understanding and enhance individual stakeholder engagement each stakeholder focused only on a relevant thematic sub module rather than the entire model there was no danger of the removal of critical variables and information from the diagram therefore this method maintained the integrity of the system the tmd final step divided the diagram and all the thematic sub modules were reconnected through the common variables and represented in the final merged cld the final cld included the complete set of variables 79 variables 32 duplicate variables and 15 loops this method maintained the critical loops and feedback processes and no information was lost applying the tmd method can help researchers visually present small easy to understand sub models to stakeholders for greater engagement and better insight into the system under consideration 5 conclusion complexity is a problem in many research disciplines and system dynamics is not an exception modelling complex phenomena is a complicated process and any tool that can help make sense of the complexity can aid our understanding of the modelled system even though stakeholder engagement in decision making is a priority in practice it is demanding to carry out due to the difficulty of understanding the modelled system processes two types of diagrams are predominant in system dynamics modelling stock and flow diagrams and causal loop diagrams this study seeked to address some of the difficulties that arise from using large combined group clds where the complexity is increased due to many variables and relationships between them this study compared two methods for simplifying complex clds the eeor and tmd methods the applied case study verified both methods applicability using a merged cld that included 79 variables 32 duplicate variables and 15 different loops the eeor method is iterative and grounded in three activities endogenisation encapsulation and order oriented based reduction in eeor 46 variables and 6 loops were removed from the complex integrated cld the final simplified cld lost 60 of its original form due to the removal of variables simplification using this method may in some cases lead to losing important information and feedback processes hence it may adversely affect the integrity of the system being investigated the tmd method can be used effectively to reduce the complexity of clds in this method the final complex cld was divided into different sub modules based on the variables nature and the diagram s requirement in our case study four thematic sub modules i e environment agriculture social and industrial and government subsidies were defined this separation allowed the modeller to evaluate the details of different aspects of the system simplification using the tmd method enables one to critically evaluate and focus on the system s relevant aspects during stakeholder discussions thus the sub modules can be recombined to produce the same initial complex cld yet maintain system integrity and retain critical information and feedback processes compared to the eeor method the thematic model approach also supports model quantification in later stages by providing help in understanding system structure however the tmd method resulted in interaction loss between different system aspects due to the removal exclusion of feedback loops despite these limitations the research described in this manuscript should be helpful for researchers who are working in the fields of stakeholder engagement system dynamics and social ecological systems credit author statement
