15995,soil colloids can affect the cotransport of nanoparticles and pollutants in this study the influencing mechanisms of organic fulvic acid fa and inorganic montmorillonite colloid mont on the cotransport of nhap and cd ii were investigated column experiments combined with derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo theory attachment efficiency calculation and two site kinetic retention model were applied to study the mechanisms results showed that the co existence of fa or mont made the transport of nhap improved by 58 75 and 33 59 respectively both of them could improve the stability of nhap particles and enhance electrostatic repulsion between nhap particles and sand retention of nhap in the sand was mainly caused by secondary energy minimum and physical straining the co existence of fa or mont changed the amount of adsorbed species of cd ii and decreased the retardation effect of nhap on cd ii transport with increasing fa concentration soluble fa cd and suspended nhap fa cd complexes in the system increased transport of soluble cd ii and total cd ii were strengthened due to the concentration effect of fa and the improved stability of nhap particles with increasing mont concentration the amount of soluble cd ii decreased but that of colloidal cd ii nhap cd and mont cd increased due to the stronger effect of colloidal cd ii change than that of the soluble cd ii change the transport of total cd ii was improved by 34 57 the findings of this study can help to understand the fate of nanoparticles and cd ii in natural water and soil graphical abstract image graphical

sewage treatment and soil remediation nano hydroxyapatite nhap has achieved high efficiency in the treatment of cadmium cd pollution in soil and water environment corami et al 2008 li et al 2019a however cd may be cotransported with nhap particles soil colloids can affect the stability of nhap and compete with nhap to adsorb cd soil organic colloids can also be adsorbed on the surface of nhap and influence the adsorption species of cd wu et al 2020 therefore the transport and fate of nhap and cd can be finally affected by soil colloids li et al 2019b ngueleu et al 2013 according to previous studies soil colloids can enhance the stability of nanoparticles nps dong et al 2016 tang and cheng 2018 promote the aggregation of nps cai et al 2014 wu and cheng 2016 and may also have no effect on the stability of nps li et al 2014 wang et al 2015 the effects are related to the properties of soil colloids and nps and the properties of the solution which include ph temperature ionic strength and ionic type erhayem and sohn 2014 tang and cheng 2018 when soil colloids coexisted with nps and pollutants the presence of soil colloids could affect both the stability of nps and the species distribution of pollutants huang et al 2012 li et al 2019a wu et al 2020 it is very important to figure out the species distribution of pollutants in the ternary system in advance for analyzing the migration characteristics of different species of pollutants numerous experimental and theoretical studies have focused on factors that influence the transport of colloids in fractured and porous media the influencing factors include the solution properties bradford et al 2012 colloid or medium properties chrysikopoulos and syngouna 2014 syngouna and chrysikopoulos 2012 and hydrodynamic conditions ryan and gschwend 1994 in the binary component systems with soil colloid or nps and pollutant the transport of pollutant might be promoted or inhibited when it was adsorbed on soil colloid or nps which was critically affected by the environmental conditions lin et al 2014 syngouna and chrysikopoulos 2013 wikiniyadhanee et al 2015 the transport of soil colloid or nps could be facilitated due to the competition of the adsorption deposition sites with pollutant on the surface of porous media shen et al 2015 yang et al 2016 the change of hydrophilicity hydrophobicity of soil colloid or nps due to pollutant adsorption could also be a reason zhao et al 2021 meanwhile the existence of pollutant might also reduce the transport of colloid when the colloidal suspension was used to leach the contaminated porous media jiang et al 2018 pollutant with high concentration could decrease colloidal stability and impede the transport of the colloid ge et al 2018 the effects of soil colloid on the transport of nps and pollutant in ternary component systems soil colloid nps pollutant were related to the properties of colloids and pollutants hydrodynamic and geochemical conditions the presence of soil colloid could enhance the stability of nps which reduces desorption of pollutant caused by nps aggregation and improves the transport of the pollutant fang et al 2016 li et al 2019a wang et al 2012 the existence of soil colloids could also inhibit the transport of nps and pollutant when soil colloids and nps had different charges he et al 2020 colloid transport theory has been originated from a combination of convection dispersion retardation theory of solute transport and colloid attachment theory marsily 1986 mcdowell boyer et al 1986 models to simulate colloid transport contain one dimensional two dimensional and three dimensional models sedimentation retention or other factors have been considered in the models bradford et al 2011 harvey and garabedian 1991 schijven and šimůnek 2002 the cotransport models have also been developed to simulate the transport of the colloids with pollutant katzourakis and chrysikopoulos 2014 even though many studies have been done on the influence of colloids on the transport of pollutants most of them focused on investigating the effects of one single type of colloids on the transport of pollutants yang et al 2016 soil colloids always coexisted and interacted with nps and pollutants in the environment the interactions between them and the binding modes affecting the cotransport of nps and different adsorption species of pollutants need to be further explored fulvic acid fa and montmorillonite colloid mont were the typical organic and inorganic colloids in soil and groundwater environment respectively their chargeability and surface functional groups were different phenolic carboxyl and nitrogen containing groups of fa were the main sites for binding heavy metal while the functional groups in mont might be al oh si oh ion exchange was often an important role for mont to adsorb heavy metals chotpantarat and kiatvarangkul 2018 li et al 2018 therefore fa and mont probably have different effects on nhap stability and cd adsorption consequently this may eventually influence the cotransport of nhap and cd the effects of fa or mont on the stability of nhap particles and on the interaction between nhap and cd ii have been studied wu and bi 2019 wu et al 2020 to our knowledge the comparative studies on the influencing mechanisms of fa and mont on the cotransport of nhap and cd have not been reported the aims of this study were i to determine the mechanisms controlling cotransport and retention of single colloids with cd ii and ii to explore the interactions among nhap cd ii and fa or mont affecting the cotransport and retention of nhap and different adsorption species of cd ii column experiments were carried out in this research to investigate the transport process zeta potential and hydrodynamic diameter hd were measured to calculate the interaction energy between particles and porous media derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo theory colloid filtration theory and two site kinetic retention model were applied to explore the transport and retention mechanisms the results of this study can provide a theoretical basis for the risk control and management of nanoparticles and heavy metal pollutants in the soil and water environment 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials nano hydroxyapatite with the particle size 100 nm was purchased from aladdin shanghai china cdcl2 2 5h2o 99 was obtained from tianjin fuchen chemical reagent factory mont was provided by hebei jinghang mineral products limited company fa produced by macklin was used and it had a purity of more than 85 the properties of nhap fa and mont can be found in our previous research wu et al 2020 the quartz sand 0 30 0 71 mm and ammonium molybdate 98 were obtained from the sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd l antimony potassium tartrate was purchased from shanghai macklin biochemical co ltd ascorbic acid 99 and potassium dihydrogen phosphate were provided by tci shanghai nitric acid and analytical grade nacl were supplied by beijing chemical works 2 2 material preparation the quartz sand was pretreated to remove metal hydroxide and organic coating impurities the treatment process was provided in section 1 in supplemental information si the scanning electron microscope energy dispersive spectrometer sem eds sigma 500 zeiss germany was applied to obtain the surface morphology and element composition of the quartz sand preparation of single component suspension of nhap fa or mont followed the procedure previously described by wu and bi 2019 stock suspensions of nhap and fa were directly prepared with ultrapure water for further utilization as for mont its stock suspension was obtained by gravity method the 4 5 g power of mont was dissolved in 500 ml ultrapure water and sonicated for 30 min then the supernatant was siphoned after being kept still for 24 h the rest of the liquid was evaporated and mont colloid concentration was calculated by the gravimetric method for binary nhap fa mont cd component systems the suspensions were stirred on a magnetic stirrer for at least 24 h after being prepared and ultrasonicated for 30 min the main function of magnetic stirring was to ensure the dispersion of colloidal particles and the adsorption equilibrium of cd ii the background solutions for all of the suspensions were 1 mm nacl the ph values of the suspensions were adjusted to 6 9 7 1 with 0 1 m naoh and 0 1 m hcl solutions after being prepared the procedure was the same as decribed abrove for the ternary nhap fa mont cd component systems except that cd ii was added after nhap fa or nhap mont suspensions being stirred for 24 h zeta potentials and hd of suspensions under different experimental conditions were measured by zetasizer zetasizer nano zs malvern england and nanobrook 90plus phase analysis light scattering nanobrook omni brookhaven germany respectively the measurements were performed after the suspensions being sonicated for 30 min and kept still for 1 h 2 3 column transport experiments the column transport experiments were conducted using glass columns with a diameter of 2 5 cm and a length of 10 cm screens were placed at the inlet and outlet ends of the column to hold the quartz sand the columns were set vertically previous research have shown that the rate of particle deposition could be greater for up flow than for down flow direction chrysikopoulos and syngouna 2014 in this study the up flow was chosen to eliminate trapped air effectively to better simulate the transport of particles in saturation zone deionized water was firstly applied to saturate the column at the flow rate of 1 70 ml min before the transport experiment then 4 8 pvs background solution 0 1 mm nacl were injected to equilibrate the column solution chemistry subsequently 4 8 pvs of the prepared suspension table 1 were injected followed by 4 8 pvs of background solution a total of 15 groups of experiments were designed and each group of experiments was carried out 2 3 times to verify the accuracy the total mass percentage recoveries in the column experiments of each component ranged from 85 to 105 concentrations of nhap fa and mont in effluent were analyzed by uv vis spectrophotometer uv 1800 shanghai at the wavelength of 300 nm 274 nm and 243 nm respectively two forms of cd ii obtained in the penetrated liquids one was the soluble cd ii and the other was the colloidal cd ii which was adsorbed onto the colloidal particles the total cd ii includes both the soluble and the colloidal cd ii concentrations of soluble and total cd ii section 2 in si in effluent were measured through inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer icp oes spectro blue germany it should be noted that the concentrations of nhap in ternary systems were obtained using the phosphomolybdate method murphy and riley 1962 chloride cl was chosen as the nonreactive tracer to study the characterization of the packed column the tracer experiment was conducted by injecting 4 8 pvs of ultrapure water followed by 4 8 pvs of tracer solution 1 mm nacl and then followed by 4 8 pvs of ultrapure water the concentrations of cl were measured through ion chromatography the fitting result of the breakthrough curve of cl was shown in fig s1 in order to determine the distribution of nhap or cd ii in the sand column after the experiments the sand in the columns were divided into 10 portions 1 cm length then they were transferred to centrifuge tubes and 20 ml of deionized water for nhap or 1 5 m hno3 for cd ii were added the centrifuge tubes were shaken for 12 h to remobilize nhap or cd ii from the sand surface the supernatants were taken out for testing after shaking the quartz sand at the entrance of the column in each experiment was collected for sem eds measurement 2 4 data analysis the interaction energies between particles and porous media were calculated by dlvo theory the total interaction energies v t o t are the sum of van der waals forces v v d w and the electric double layer forces v e d l 1 v t o t v v d w v e d l the experimental attachment efficiency α which represents the fraction of collisions resulting in attachment between particles and porous media was also obtained based on experimental data it can be calculated from the following equation tufenkji and elimelech 2004 2 α 2 3 d c 1 n l c η 0 l n c i c 0 where dc is the diameter of quartz sand l n the porosity lc is the length of the column l η0 is the single collector contact efficiency ci is the effluent concentration of particles m l 3 and c0 is the influent concentration of particles m l 3 the breakthrough curves btcs of nps under different conditions were simulated using the one dimensional convection dispersion equation with a two site kinetic retention model bradford et al 2003 schijven and šimůnek 2002 even though this model does not account for nanoparticle interaction with other pollutants good fitting results have been obtained from its application in some studies liu et al 2019 3 θ c t ρ b s 1 t ρ b s 2 t z θ d c z q c z where θ is the volumetric water content c is the concentration of colloidal particles in aqueous phase n l 3 t is the time t ρb is the bulk density of porous media m l 3 s1 and s2 are the solid particle concentrations related to retention site 1 and 2 respectively n m 1 z is the vertical transport distance l d is the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient l2 t 1 and q is the darcy velocity l t 1 the values of s1 and s2 were obtained by fitting the breakthrough curves in hydrus 1d model details of the equations and parameters were given in si section 3 3 results and discussion 3 1 cotransport of nhap and cd the individual transport and cotransport of nhap and cd ii were both studied results showed that the recoveries of nhap particles were quite low and about 85 of the particles were retained in the column the existing cd ii promoted the transport of nhap and the recovery of nhap was 5 higher than that in the single component system fig 1 a the recovery of cd ii could reach 95 in the single component system however when cd ii was adsorbed onto the surface of nhap particles its migration ability decreased greatly the recoveries of total cd ii and the soluble cd ii were only 15 and 11 respectively fig 1c a small amount of cd ii in the single component system was retained in the column since cd ii could be complexed with si o groups on the surface of quartz sand srilert and niruch 2018 however with co existing of nhap cd ii could be retained with nhap particles in the column which led to a reduction in cd ii recovery the slightly improved transport of nhap in the presence of cd ii was probably resulted from the adsorption of cd ii onto the surface of quartz sand which reduced the degree of charge heterogeneity of the porous media ryan and elimelech 1996 the retention profiles of nhap exhibited a hyperexponential shape fig 1b this might be related to the chemical heterogeneity of porous media and colloids surface charge heterogeneity and surface roughness of the porous media straining of colloids colloid aggregation secondary minimum hydrodynamic conditions and other factors bradford et al 2009 tong and johnson 2007 tufenkji and elimelech 2005 wang et al 2011 mitropoulou et al 2013 proved that straining was a critical process during the transport of colloids under a wide range of ionic strength for nacl from 0 1 to 1000 mm the ratios of nhap particle sizes to that of porous media were between 0 0023 and 0 0076 which were larger than the threshold value for straining 0 0017 bradford et al 2002 this indicated that nhap particles could be strained obviously in the inlet of the column white particle aggregates could be seen on the surface of the quartz sand from the sem eds images the elements of the aggregates contained ca and p which were the main elements of nhap fig 2 this indicated that nhap particles were strained at the entrance of the column experimental results also verified the straining effect fig s2 the retention profile of cd ii became more exponential when cd ii was adsorbed onto nhap particles fig 1d 3 2 effects of fa on the cotransport of nhap and cd 3 2 1 cotransport of fa and cd the transport of cd ii was reduced when it cotransported with 10 mg l fa and its recovery was reduced from 95 to 89 however fa with concentration of 50 mg l had little effect on the transport of cd ii at the same time results showed the presence of cd ii promoted the transport of fa the recoveries of fa increased from 61 to 89 at 10 mg l and 82 to 94 at 50 mg l fig 3 the retention profiles of fa and cd ii did not show exponential shape and were relatively flat fig s3 even though fa and quartz sand were both negatively charged and there was electrostatic repulsion between them fa could not achieve complete penetration the reason was that the phenolic hydroxyl and carboxyl groups on fa could complex with si o groups on the surface of quartz sand chotpantarat and kiatvarangkul 2018 li et al 2018 wu et al 2020 the recovery of fa had a great relationship with its input concentration the higher the concentration of fa the smaller the attachment efficiency of quartz sand to fa the main reason was that the effective attachment sites on the surface of quartz sand could be occupied quickly when the concentration of fa was high it could reduce the retention rate of fa in the column and increase the penetration kasel et al 2013 sun et al 2015 the addition of cd ii had a negligible effect on the charge of fa colloids thus the charge change was not the dominant factor influencing fa transport cd ii could complex with fa and attach to the surface of quartz sand in the form of fa cd complex wu et al 2020 which reduced its penetration the presence of cd ii enhanced fa transport and it was mainly caused by the competitive adsorption between cd ii and fa onto the surface of quartz sand the complexation of cd ii with phenolic hydroxyl and hydroxyl groups of fa could also reduce the binding of fa with si o groups on quartz sand 3 2 2 cotransport of nhap and cd influenced by fa the co existence of fa improved the transport of nhap and cd ii compared with nhap cd system with addition of 10 mg l and 50 mg l fa the recoveries of nhap increased from 15 to 73 and 90 respectively fig 4 a the recoveries of soluble cd ii increased from 11 to 33 and 37 and total cd ii increased from 15 to 76 and 77 respectively fig 4c according to wu et al 2020 species fa cd nhap cd nhap fa cd and cd ii existed in nhap fa cd systems when fa concentration increased from 10 to 50 mg l adsorbed amount of cd ii on solid phase nhap fa cd and nhap cd decreased but the soluble cd ii cd ii and fa cd increased more nhap fa cd complexes formed at higher fa concentration the stability of nhap particles was improved after fa was adsorbed on the surface of nhap particles wu et al 2020 this reduced the retention of nhap and improved the transport of total cd ii even though the retardation factor rf is often a space dependent parameter chrysikopoulos et al 1990 1992 in this study the rf values were compared in near the plateau period of the penetration curves under various experimental conditions to better explain the influence of colloids on cd ii transport compared with nhap cd binary component system the coefficient kd of cd ii in nhap fa cd ternary component systems decreased by 12 70 and 13 33 times rf decreased by 6 17 and 6 32 times and the velocity of groundwater u increased by 6 17 and 6 32 times for 10 mg l and 50 mg l fa respectively table s1 this indicated that the retardation effect of nhap on the transport of cd ii decreased in the presence of fa the electronegativity of the system was enhanced in the existence of fa so the electrostatic repulsion between nhap particles and quartz sand was strengthened at the same time the hd of the particles decreased table 1 and consequently reduced the ratio of nhap particles size to that of porous media fig s4 the retention of nhap particles in the sand column still showed an obvious decreasing trend from inlet to outlet figs 4b and s5 previous studies have investigated the transport and retention of colloid by dlvo theory adamczyk et al 1983 hahn and o meliae 2004 liu et al 2018 our calculated dlvo results indicated that whether fa existed or not the double layer repulsion dominated the interaction between nhap particles and quartz sand table 2 the values of the primary energy barrier φ max were so high that the kinetic energy between particles was not enough to exceed the φ max and the particles deposited on the surface of quartz sand however values of secondary minimum φ min2 were small and less than 1 5 kbt indicating that a small amount of particles could be trapped and retained in the column values of φ max and φ min2 between nhap particles and quartz sand increased in the presence of fa table 2 it indicated that the adsorption of fa could enhance the double layer repulsion between nhap particles and quartz sand and reduce the retention of nhap particles the barrier of adding 50 mg l fa was higher than that of adding 10 mg l fa resulting in higher recoveries of nhap particles at higher fa concentrations fig s6 previous studies had shown that humic acid could reduce the retention of nano and micro sized colloidal particles in porous media based on α values akbour et al 2002 davis et al 2002 kretzschmar and sticher 1997 the calculated α values between nhap and quartz sand decreased after adding fa and α10 fa 10 mg l was larger than α50 fa 50 mg l table 2 it indicated that the retention of nhap deceased with increasing fa concentration the two site kinetic retention model could well fit the breakthrough curves of nhap particles under various experimental conditions results indicated that nhap particles were more likely to stay on reversible sites k1 k2 table s2 with increasing fa concentration k1 and k2 decreased gradually which means that the presence of fa could reduce the retention of nhap particles both on reversible and irreversible retention sites liu et al 2019 the reduction was greater at higher fa concentration 3 3 effects of mont on the cotransport of nhap and cd 3 3 1 cotransport of mont and cd cd ii could transport in the form of soluble cd ii and colloidal cd ii mont cd complex when it cotransported with mont wu et al 2020 the plateau c c0 of total cd ii decreased from 0 99 to 0 90 and 0 93 and the recoveries decreased from 95 to 90 and 94 for adding 10 mg l and 50 mg l mont respectively fig 5 a it indicated that the presence of mont weakened the transport of cd ii under the experimental conditions results also showed the presence of cd ii could promote the transport of mont the recoveries of mont increased from 69 to 91 at 10 mg l and from 91 to 102 at 50 mg l fig 5b the retention profiles of cd ii influenced by mont did not show exponential shape and were relatively flat fig s7 the input concentration of mont could affect the α values of quartz sand to mont particles which could finally influence mont transport he et al 2019 li et al 2019a liang et al 2013 the greater the mont concentration the smaller the α values the number of attachment sites on the surface of quartz sand was limited when the concentration of mont was high the effective attachment sites on the surface of quartz sand could be occupied quickly it increased the penetration of mont and explained the phenomenon of higher recovery of cd ii at higher concentration of mont when cd ii cotransported with mont cd ii could be retained on the surface of quartz sand in the form of mont cd complex and this caused penetration reduction of cd ii however the presence of cd ii enhanced the transport of mont resulting from that adsorption of cd ii onto the surface of quartz sand reduced charge heterogeneity of the porous media ryan and elimelech 1996 the ratio of the size of mont particles to that of quartz sand was 0 0007 0 0021 it was smaller than or close to the threshold value for straining 0 0017 bradford et al 2002 so the retention profile did not show an obvious hyperexponential type 3 3 2 cotransport of nhap and cd influenced by mont the transport of nhap particles soluble cd ii and total cd ii was enhanced in the nhap mont cd systems compared with nhap cd systems fig 6 with addition of 10 mg l and 50 mg l mont the increased recoveries were 33 and 59 for nhap 24 and 18 for soluble cd ii and 34 and 57 for total cd ii respectively the retention profiles of nhap particles still exhibited a hyperexponential shape however the co existence of mont weakened the exponential shape of cd ii our previous research had already shown that cd ii mainly existed in the form of soluble cd ii and colloidal cd ii nhap cd and mont cd complex in nhap mont cd ternary component systems with increasing mont concentration hd of particles decreased the proportion of colloidal cd ii increased and the proportion of soluble cd ii decreased wu et al 2020 therefore the recovery of soluble cd ii was lower at higher mont concentration the smaller hd caused less straining of mont particles and higher recovery of colloidal cd ii compared with nhap cd system cd ii kd in nhap mont cd systems decreased by 3 73 and 11 34 times rf decreased by 2 73 and 5 80 times and u increased by 2 73 and 5 80 times for 10 mg l and 50 mg l mont respectively table s1 it showed that the retardation effect of nhap on the transport of cd ii decreased with coexistence of mont the presence of mont enhanced the electronegativity and reduced the hd of the particles table 1 therefore the electrostatic repulsion between nhap particles and quartz sand was strengthened at the same time the ratio of the size of nhap particles to that of porous media reduced which decreased the straining of nhap particles competition for retention sites between mont and nhap particles was also an important reason for the enhanced transport of nhap cai et al 2013 han et al 2016 the experimental phenomena and sem eds analysis verified the results figs s8 and s9 according to dlvo calculation results φ max and φ min2 between nhap particles and quartz sand increased in the presence of mont table 2 it indicated the double layer repulsion between them was enhanced fig s10 at the same time the values of α decreased after adding mont the value of α10 mont 10 mg l was larger than α50 mont 50 mg l which indicated the higher recovery of nhap at higher concentration of mont two site kinetic retention model could well fit the breakthrough curves of nhap particles in ternary system nhap mont cd table s2 the nhap particles preferred to stay on reversible sites k1 k2 parameters k1 and k2 decreased gradually with increasing mont concentration it indicated the existence of mont reduced the retention of nhap particles both on reversible and irreversible sites liu et al 2019 3 4 comparison of influencing mechanisms between fa and mont even though fa and mont have different chargeability and surface functional groups the addition of either of them could improve the transport of nhap and cd ii fa and mont could enhance the electronegativity of the system and strengthen the repulsion force between nhap particles and the porous media retention of nhap in the nhap fa cd or nhap mont cd systems was mainly caused by secondary energy minimum and physical straining the amount of adsorbed species of cd ii was changed by co existence of fa or mont soluble cd ii increased with increasing fa concentration but decreased with increasing mont concentration therefore transport of soluble cd ii was enhanced with higher fa concentration but weakened with higher mont concentration more colloidal nhap fa cd or mont cd complexes were formed at higher fa or mont concentration transport of total cd ii was enhanced since fa or mont colloid decreased retardation effect of nhap on cd ii transport 4 conclusions column transport experiments combined with dlvo theory attachment efficiency calculation and two site kinetic retention model were applied to study the effects of fa or mont on the cotransport of nhap and cd ii results showed that the co existence of fa or mont could improve both the transport of nhap and cd ii compared with nhap cd system the effects of fa or mont on the stability of nhap particles and on the species distribution of cd ii played an important role on the transport of nhap and cd ii fa or mont strengthened the repulsion force and decreased the attachment efficiency between nhap particles and porous media the concentration of fa or mont had a great influence on the distribution ratio of soluble cd ii and colloidal cd ii with increasing fa concentration the content of soluble cd ii and suspended nhap fa cd increased leading to the lower retention of soluble cd ii and total cd ii however the content of soluble cd ii decreased but that of colloidal cd ii nhap cd and mont cd increased with increasing mont concentration due to the effects of colloidal cd ii although the trasnport of soluble cd ii was weakened the penetration of total cd ii was enhanced these findings can provide a theoretical basis for the risk control and management of nanoparticles and heavy metal pollutants

15995,soil colloids can affect the cotransport of nanoparticles and pollutants in this study the influencing mechanisms of organic fulvic acid fa and inorganic montmorillonite colloid mont on the cotransport of nhap and cd ii were investigated column experiments combined with derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo theory attachment efficiency calculation and two site kinetic retention model were applied to study the mechanisms results showed that the co existence of fa or mont made the transport of nhap improved by 58 75 and 33 59 respectively both of them could improve the stability of nhap particles and enhance electrostatic repulsion between nhap particles and sand retention of nhap in the sand was mainly caused by secondary energy minimum and physical straining the co existence of fa or mont changed the amount of adsorbed species of cd ii and decreased the retardation effect of nhap on cd ii transport with increasing fa concentration soluble fa cd and suspended nhap fa cd complexes in the system increased transport of soluble cd ii and total cd ii were strengthened due to the concentration effect of fa and the improved stability of nhap particles with increasing mont concentration the amount of soluble cd ii decreased but that of colloidal cd ii nhap cd and mont cd increased due to the stronger effect of colloidal cd ii change than that of the soluble cd ii change the transport of total cd ii was improved by 34 57 the findings of this study can help to understand the fate of nanoparticles and cd ii in natural water and soil graphical abstract image graphical

hydrodynamic conditions ryan and gschwend 1994 in the binary component systems with soil colloid or nps and pollutant the transport of pollutant might be promoted or inhibited when it was adsorbed on soil colloid or nps which was critically affected by the environmental conditions lin et al 2014 syngouna and chrysikopoulos 2013 wikiniyadhanee et al 2015 the transport of soil colloid or nps could be facilitated due to the competition of the adsorption deposition sites with pollutant on the surface of porous media shen et al 2015 yang et al 2016 the change of hydrophilicity hydrophobicity of soil colloid or nps due to pollutant adsorption could also be a reason zhao et al 2021 meanwhile the existence of pollutant might also reduce the transport of colloid when the colloidal suspension was used to leach the contaminated porous media jiang et al 2018 pollutant with high concentration could decrease colloidal stability and impede the transport of the colloid ge et al 2018 the effects of soil colloid on the transport of nps and pollutant in ternary component systems soil colloid nps pollutant were related to the properties of colloids and pollutants hydrodynamic and geochemical conditions the presence of soil colloid could enhance the stability of nps which reduces desorption of pollutant caused by nps aggregation and improves the transport of the pollutant fang et al 2016 li et al 2019a wang et al 2012 the existence of soil colloids could also inhibit the transport of nps and pollutant when soil colloids and nps had different charges he et al 2020 colloid transport theory has been originated from a combination of convection dispersion retardation theory of solute transport and colloid attachment theory marsily 1986 mcdowell boyer et al 1986 models to simulate colloid transport contain one dimensional two dimensional and three dimensional models sedimentation retention or other factors have been considered in the models bradford et al 2011 harvey and garabedian 1991 schijven and šimůnek 2002 the cotransport models have also been developed to simulate the transport of the colloids with pollutant katzourakis and chrysikopoulos 2014 even though many studies have been done on the influence of colloids on the transport of pollutants most of them focused on investigating the effects of one single type of colloids on the transport of pollutants yang et al 2016 soil colloids always coexisted and interacted with nps and pollutants in the environment the interactions between them and the binding modes affecting the cotransport of nps and different adsorption species of pollutants need to be further explored fulvic acid fa and montmorillonite colloid mont were the typical organic and inorganic colloids in soil and groundwater environment respectively their chargeability and surface functional groups were different phenolic carboxyl and nitrogen containing groups of fa were the main sites for binding heavy metal while the functional groups in mont might be al oh si oh ion exchange was often an important role for mont to adsorb heavy metals chotpantarat and kiatvarangkul 2018 li et al 2018 therefore fa and mont probably have different effects on nhap stability and cd adsorption consequently this may eventually influence the cotransport of nhap and cd the effects of fa or mont on the stability of nhap particles and on the interaction between nhap and cd ii have been studied wu and bi 2019 wu et al 2020 to our knowledge the comparative studies on the influencing mechanisms of fa and mont on the cotransport of nhap and cd have not been reported the aims of this study were i to determine the mechanisms controlling cotransport and retention of single colloids with cd ii and ii to explore the interactions among nhap cd ii and fa or mont affecting the cotransport and retention of nhap and different adsorption species of cd ii column experiments were carried out in this research to investigate the transport process zeta potential and hydrodynamic diameter hd were measured to calculate the interaction energy between particles and porous media derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo theory colloid filtration theory and two site kinetic retention model were applied to explore the transport and retention mechanisms the results of this study can provide a theoretical basis for the risk control and management of nanoparticles and heavy metal pollutants in the soil and water environment 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials nano hydroxyapatite with the particle size 100 nm was purchased from aladdin shanghai china cdcl2 2 5h2o 99 was obtained from tianjin fuchen chemical reagent factory mont was provided by hebei jinghang mineral products limited company fa produced by macklin was used and it had a purity of more than 85 the properties of nhap fa and mont can be found in our previous research wu et al 2020 the quartz sand 0 30 0 71 mm and ammonium molybdate 98 were obtained from the sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd l antimony potassium tartrate was purchased from shanghai macklin biochemical co ltd ascorbic acid 99 and potassium dihydrogen phosphate were provided by tci shanghai nitric acid and analytical grade nacl were supplied by beijing chemical works 2 2 material preparation the quartz sand was pretreated to remove metal hydroxide and organic coating impurities the treatment process was provided in section 1 in supplemental information si the scanning electron microscope energy dispersive spectrometer sem eds sigma 500 zeiss germany was applied to obtain the surface morphology and element composition of the quartz sand preparation of single component suspension of nhap fa or mont followed the procedure previously described by wu and bi 2019 stock suspensions of nhap and fa were directly prepared with ultrapure water for further utilization as for mont its stock suspension was obtained by gravity method the 4 5 g power of mont was dissolved in 500 ml ultrapure water and sonicated for 30 min then the supernatant was siphoned after being kept still for 24 h the rest of the liquid was evaporated and mont colloid concentration was calculated by the gravimetric method for binary nhap fa mont cd component systems the suspensions were stirred on a magnetic stirrer for at least 24 h after being prepared and ultrasonicated for 30 min the main function of magnetic stirring was to ensure the dispersion of colloidal particles and the adsorption equilibrium of cd ii the background solutions for all of the suspensions were 1 mm nacl the ph values of the suspensions were adjusted to 6 9 7 1 with 0 1 m naoh and 0 1 m hcl solutions after being prepared the procedure was the same as decribed abrove for the ternary nhap fa mont cd component systems except that cd ii was added after nhap fa or nhap mont suspensions being stirred for 24 h zeta potentials and hd of suspensions under different experimental conditions were measured by zetasizer zetasizer nano zs malvern england and nanobrook 90plus phase analysis light scattering nanobrook omni brookhaven germany respectively the measurements were performed after the suspensions being sonicated for 30 min and kept still for 1 h 2 3 column transport experiments the column transport experiments were conducted using glass columns with a diameter of 2 5 cm and a length of 10 cm screens were placed at the inlet and outlet ends of the column to hold the quartz sand the columns were set vertically previous research have shown that the rate of particle deposition could be greater for up flow than for down flow direction chrysikopoulos and syngouna 2014 in this study the up flow was chosen to eliminate trapped air effectively to better simulate the transport of particles in saturation zone deionized water was firstly applied to saturate the column at the flow rate of 1 70 ml min before the transport experiment then 4 8 pvs background solution 0 1 mm nacl were injected to equilibrate the column solution chemistry subsequently 4 8 pvs of the prepared suspension table 1 were injected followed by 4 8 pvs of background solution a total of 15 groups of experiments were designed and each group of experiments was carried out 2 3 times to verify the accuracy the total mass percentage recoveries in the column experiments of each component ranged from 85 to 105 concentrations of nhap fa and mont in effluent were analyzed by uv vis spectrophotometer uv 1800 shanghai at the wavelength of 300 nm 274 nm and 243 nm respectively two forms of cd ii obtained in the penetrated liquids one was the soluble cd ii and the other was the colloidal cd ii which was adsorbed onto the colloidal particles the total cd ii includes both the soluble and the colloidal cd ii concentrations of soluble and total cd ii section 2 in si in effluent were measured through inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer icp oes spectro blue germany it should be noted that the concentrations of nhap in ternary systems were obtained using the phosphomolybdate method murphy and riley 1962 chloride cl was chosen as the nonreactive tracer to study the characterization of the packed column the tracer experiment was conducted by injecting 4 8 pvs of ultrapure water followed by 4 8 pvs of tracer solution 1 mm nacl and then followed by 4 8 pvs of ultrapure water the concentrations of cl were measured through ion chromatography the fitting result of the breakthrough curve of cl was shown in fig s1 in order to determine the distribution of nhap or cd ii in the sand column after the experiments the sand in the columns were divided into 10 portions 1 cm length then they were transferred to centrifuge tubes and 20 ml of deionized water for nhap or 1 5 m hno3 for cd ii were added the centrifuge tubes were shaken for 12 h to remobilize nhap or cd ii from the sand surface the supernatants were taken out for testing after shaking the quartz sand at the entrance of the column in each experiment was collected for sem eds measurement 2 4 data analysis the interaction energies between particles and porous media were calculated by dlvo theory the total interaction energies v t o t are the sum of van der waals forces v v d w and the electric double layer forces v e d l 1 v t o t v v d w v e d l the experimental attachment efficiency α which represents the fraction of collisions resulting in attachment between particles and porous media was also obtained based on experimental data it can be calculated from the following equation tufenkji and elimelech 2004 2 α 2 3 d c 1 n l c η 0 l n c i c 0 where dc is the diameter of quartz sand l n the porosity lc is the length of the column l η0 is the single collector contact efficiency ci is the effluent concentration of particles m l 3 and c0 is the influent concentration of particles m l 3 the breakthrough curves btcs of nps under different conditions were simulated using the one dimensional convection dispersion equation with a two site kinetic retention model bradford et al 2003 schijven and šimůnek 2002 even though this model does not account for nanoparticle interaction with other pollutants good fitting results have been obtained from its application in some studies liu et al 2019 3 θ c t ρ b s 1 t ρ b s 2 t z θ d c z q c z where θ is the volumetric water content c is the concentration of colloidal particles in aqueous phase n l 3 t is the time t ρb is the bulk density of porous media m l 3 s1 and s2 are the solid particle concentrations related to retention site 1 and 2 respectively n m 1 z is the vertical transport distance l d is the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient l2 t 1 and q is the darcy velocity l t 1 the values of s1 and s2 were obtained by fitting the breakthrough curves in hydrus 1d model details of the equations and parameters were given in si section 3 3 results and discussion 3 1 cotransport of nhap and cd the individual transport and cotransport of nhap and cd ii were both studied results showed that the recoveries of nhap particles were quite low and about 85 of the particles were retained in the column the existing cd ii promoted the transport of nhap and the recovery of nhap was 5 higher than that in the single component system fig 1 a the recovery of cd ii could reach 95 in the single component system however when cd ii was adsorbed onto the surface of nhap particles its migration ability decreased greatly the recoveries of total cd ii and the soluble cd ii were only 15 and 11 respectively fig 1c a small amount of cd ii in the single component system was retained in the column since cd ii could be complexed with si o groups on the surface of quartz sand srilert and niruch 2018 however with co existing of nhap cd ii could be retained with nhap particles in the column which led to a reduction in cd ii recovery the slightly improved transport of nhap in the presence of cd ii was probably resulted from the adsorption of cd ii onto the surface of quartz sand which reduced the degree of charge heterogeneity of the porous media ryan and elimelech 1996 the retention profiles of nhap exhibited a hyperexponential shape fig 1b this might be related to the chemical heterogeneity of porous media and colloids surface charge heterogeneity and surface roughness of the porous media straining of colloids colloid aggregation secondary minimum hydrodynamic conditions and other factors bradford et al 2009 tong and johnson 2007 tufenkji and elimelech 2005 wang et al 2011 mitropoulou et al 2013 proved that straining was a critical process during the transport of colloids under a wide range of ionic strength for nacl from 0 1 to 1000 mm the ratios of nhap particle sizes to that of porous media were between 0 0023 and 0 0076 which were larger than the threshold value for straining 0 0017 bradford et al 2002 this indicated that nhap particles could be strained obviously in the inlet of the column white particle aggregates could be seen on the surface of the quartz sand from the sem eds images the elements of the aggregates contained ca and p which were the main elements of nhap fig 2 this indicated that nhap particles were strained at the entrance of the column experimental results also verified the straining effect fig s2 the retention profile of cd ii became more exponential when cd ii was adsorbed onto nhap particles fig 1d 3 2 effects of fa on the cotransport of nhap and cd 3 2 1 cotransport of fa and cd the transport of cd ii was reduced when it cotransported with 10 mg l fa and its recovery was reduced from 95 to 89 however fa with concentration of 50 mg l had little effect on the transport of cd ii at the same time results showed the presence of cd ii promoted the transport of fa the recoveries of fa increased from 61 to 89 at 10 mg l and 82 to 94 at 50 mg l fig 3 the retention profiles of fa and cd ii did not show exponential shape and were relatively flat fig s3 even though fa and quartz sand were both negatively charged and there was electrostatic repulsion between them fa could not achieve complete penetration the reason was that the phenolic hydroxyl and carboxyl groups on fa could complex with si o groups on the surface of quartz sand chotpantarat and kiatvarangkul 2018 li et al 2018 wu et al 2020 the recovery of fa had a great relationship with its input concentration the higher the concentration of fa the smaller the attachment efficiency of quartz sand to fa the main reason was that the effective attachment sites on the surface of quartz sand could be occupied quickly when the concentration of fa was high it could reduce the retention rate of fa in the column and increase the penetration kasel et al 2013 sun et al 2015 the addition of cd ii had a negligible effect on the charge of fa colloids thus the charge change was not the dominant factor influencing fa transport cd ii could complex with fa and attach to the surface of quartz sand in the form of fa cd complex wu et al 2020 which reduced its penetration the presence of cd ii enhanced fa transport and it was mainly caused by the competitive adsorption between cd ii and fa onto the surface of quartz sand the complexation of cd ii with phenolic hydroxyl and hydroxyl groups of fa could also reduce the binding of fa with si o groups on quartz sand 3 2 2 cotransport of nhap and cd influenced by fa the co existence of fa improved the transport of nhap and cd ii compared with nhap cd system with addition of 10 mg l and 50 mg l fa the recoveries of nhap increased from 15 to 73 and 90 respectively fig 4 a the recoveries of soluble cd ii increased from 11 to 33 and 37 and total cd ii increased from 15 to 76 and 77 respectively fig 4c according to wu et al 2020 species fa cd nhap cd nhap fa cd and cd ii existed in nhap fa cd systems when fa concentration increased from 10 to 50 mg l adsorbed amount of cd ii on solid phase nhap fa cd and nhap cd decreased but the soluble cd ii cd ii and fa cd increased more nhap fa cd complexes formed at higher fa concentration the stability of nhap particles was improved after fa was adsorbed on the surface of nhap particles wu et al 2020 this reduced the retention of nhap and improved the transport of total cd ii even though the retardation factor rf is often a space dependent parameter chrysikopoulos et al 1990 1992 in this study the rf values were compared in near the plateau period of the penetration curves under various experimental conditions to better explain the influence of colloids on cd ii transport compared with nhap cd binary component system the coefficient kd of cd ii in nhap fa cd ternary component systems decreased by 12 70 and 13 33 times rf decreased by 6 17 and 6 32 times and the velocity of groundwater u increased by 6 17 and 6 32 times for 10 mg l and 50 mg l fa respectively table s1 this indicated that the retardation effect of nhap on the transport of cd ii decreased in the presence of fa the electronegativity of the system was enhanced in the existence of fa so the electrostatic repulsion between nhap particles and quartz sand was strengthened at the same time the hd of the particles decreased table 1 and consequently reduced the ratio of nhap particles size to that of porous media fig s4 the retention of nhap particles in the sand column still showed an obvious decreasing trend from inlet to outlet figs 4b and s5 previous studies have investigated the transport and retention of colloid by dlvo theory adamczyk et al 1983 hahn and o meliae 2004 liu et al 2018 our calculated dlvo results indicated that whether fa existed or not the double layer repulsion dominated the interaction between nhap particles and quartz sand table 2 the values of the primary energy barrier φ max were so high that the kinetic energy between particles was not enough to exceed the φ max and the particles deposited on the surface of quartz sand however values of secondary minimum φ min2 were small and less than 1 5 kbt indicating that a small amount of particles could be trapped and retained in the column values of φ max and φ min2 between nhap particles and quartz sand increased in the presence of fa table 2 it indicated that the adsorption of fa could enhance the double layer repulsion between nhap particles and quartz sand and reduce the retention of nhap particles the barrier of adding 50 mg l fa was higher than that of adding 10 mg l fa resulting in higher recoveries of nhap particles at higher fa concentrations fig s6 previous studies had shown that humic acid could reduce the retention of nano and micro sized colloidal particles in porous media based on α values akbour et al 2002 davis et al 2002 kretzschmar and sticher 1997 the calculated α values between nhap and quartz sand decreased after adding fa and α10 fa 10 mg l was larger than α50 fa 50 mg l table 2 it indicated that the retention of nhap deceased with increasing fa concentration the two site kinetic retention model could well fit the breakthrough curves of nhap particles under various experimental conditions results indicated that nhap particles were more likely to stay on reversible sites k1 k2 table s2 with increasing fa concentration k1 and k2 decreased gradually which means that the presence of fa could reduce the retention of nhap particles both on reversible and irreversible retention sites liu et al 2019 the reduction was greater at higher fa concentration 3 3 effects of mont on the cotransport of nhap and cd 3 3 1 cotransport of mont and cd cd ii could transport in the form of soluble cd ii and colloidal cd ii mont cd complex when it cotransported with mont wu et al 2020 the plateau c c0 of total cd ii decreased from 0 99 to 0 90 and 0 93 and the recoveries decreased from 95 to 90 and 94 for adding 10 mg l and 50 mg l mont respectively fig 5 a it indicated that the presence of mont weakened the transport of cd ii under the experimental conditions results also showed the presence of cd ii could promote the transport of mont the recoveries of mont increased from 69 to 91 at 10 mg l and from 91 to 102 at 50 mg l fig 5b the retention profiles of cd ii influenced by mont did not show exponential shape and were relatively flat fig s7 the input concentration of mont could affect the α values of quartz sand to mont particles which could finally influence mont transport he et al 2019 li et al 2019a liang et al 2013 the greater the mont concentration the smaller the α values the number of attachment sites on the surface of quartz sand was limited when the concentration of mont was high the effective attachment sites on the surface of quartz sand could be occupied quickly it increased the penetration of mont and explained the phenomenon of higher recovery of cd ii at higher concentration of mont when cd ii cotransported with mont cd ii could be retained on the surface of quartz sand in the form of mont cd complex and this caused penetration reduction of cd ii however the presence of cd ii enhanced the transport of mont resulting from that adsorption of cd ii onto the surface of quartz sand reduced charge heterogeneity of the porous media ryan and elimelech 1996 the ratio of the size of mont particles to that of quartz sand was 0 0007 0 0021 it was smaller than or close to the threshold value for straining 0 0017 bradford et al 2002 so the retention profile did not show an obvious hyperexponential type 3 3 2 cotransport of nhap and cd influenced by mont the transport of nhap particles soluble cd ii and total cd ii was enhanced in the nhap mont cd systems compared with nhap cd systems fig 6 with addition of 10 mg l and 50 mg l mont the increased recoveries were 33 and 59 for nhap 24 and 18 for soluble cd ii and 34 and 57 for total cd ii respectively the retention profiles of nhap particles still exhibited a hyperexponential shape however the co existence of mont weakened the exponential shape of cd ii our previous research had already shown that cd ii mainly existed in the form of soluble cd ii and colloidal cd ii nhap cd and mont cd complex in nhap mont cd ternary component systems with increasing mont concentration hd of particles decreased the proportion of colloidal cd ii increased and the proportion of soluble cd ii decreased wu et al 2020 therefore the recovery of soluble cd ii was lower at higher mont concentration the smaller hd caused less straining of mont particles and higher recovery of colloidal cd ii compared with nhap cd system cd ii kd in nhap mont cd systems decreased by 3 73 and 11 34 times rf decreased by 2 73 and 5 80 times and u increased by 2 73 and 5 80 times for 10 mg l and 50 mg l mont respectively table s1 it showed that the retardation effect of nhap on the transport of cd ii decreased with coexistence of mont the presence of mont enhanced the electronegativity and reduced the hd of the particles table 1 therefore the electrostatic repulsion between nhap particles and quartz sand was strengthened at the same time the ratio of the size of nhap particles to that of porous media reduced which decreased the straining of nhap particles competition for retention sites between mont and nhap particles was also an important reason for the enhanced transport of nhap cai et al 2013 han et al 2016 the experimental phenomena and sem eds analysis verified the results figs s8 and s9 according to dlvo calculation results φ max and φ min2 between nhap particles and quartz sand increased in the presence of mont table 2 it indicated the double layer repulsion between them was enhanced fig s10 at the same time the values of α decreased after adding mont the value of α10 mont 10 mg l was larger than α50 mont 50 mg l which indicated the higher recovery of nhap at higher concentration of mont two site kinetic retention model could well fit the breakthrough curves of nhap particles in ternary system nhap mont cd table s2 the nhap particles preferred to stay on reversible sites k1 k2 parameters k1 and k2 decreased gradually with increasing mont concentration it indicated the existence of mont reduced the retention of nhap particles both on reversible and irreversible sites liu et al 2019 3 4 comparison of influencing mechanisms between fa and mont even though fa and mont have different chargeability and surface functional groups the addition of either of them could improve the transport of nhap and cd ii fa and mont could enhance the electronegativity of the system and strengthen the repulsion force between nhap particles and the porous media retention of nhap in the nhap fa cd or nhap mont cd systems was mainly caused by secondary energy minimum and physical straining the amount of adsorbed species of cd ii was changed by co existence of fa or mont soluble cd ii increased with increasing fa concentration but decreased with increasing mont concentration therefore transport of soluble cd ii was enhanced with higher fa concentration but weakened with higher mont concentration more colloidal nhap fa cd or mont cd complexes were formed at higher fa or mont concentration transport of total cd ii was enhanced since fa or mont colloid decreased retardation effect of nhap on cd ii transport 4 conclusions column transport experiments combined with dlvo theory attachment efficiency calculation and two site kinetic retention model were applied to study the effects of fa or mont on the cotransport of nhap and cd ii results showed that the co existence of fa or mont could improve both the transport of nhap and cd ii compared with nhap cd system the effects of fa or mont on the stability of nhap particles and on the species distribution of cd ii played an important role on the transport of nhap and cd ii fa or mont strengthened the repulsion force and decreased the attachment efficiency between nhap particles and porous media the concentration of fa or mont had a great influence on the distribution ratio of soluble cd ii and colloidal cd ii with increasing fa concentration the content of soluble cd ii and suspended nhap fa cd increased leading to the lower retention of soluble cd ii and total cd ii however the content of soluble cd ii decreased but that of colloidal cd ii nhap cd and mont cd increased with increasing mont concentration due to the effects of colloidal cd ii although the trasnport of soluble cd ii was weakened the penetration of total cd ii was enhanced these findings can provide a theoretical basis for the risk control and management of nanoparticles and heavy metal pollutants

15996,gypsum scaling via crystallization is a major obstacle limiting the applications of membrane based technologies and heat exchangers in engineered systems herein we perform the first comparative investigation on the impacts of natural organic matter suwannee river humic acid srha and colloidal particles on the gypsum crystallization process in terms of induction time and crystal morphology results show that the presence of srha significantly increases the induction time of gypsum crystallization specifically at a solution saturation index of 4 92 the induction time increases 6 5 fold in the presence of 6 mg l srha compared to the case without srha srha also alters the morphology of the formed calcium sulfate crystals resulting in a polygon like shape differing from the characteristic needle like shape of gypsum in the absence of additives these changes in crystal morphology are attributed to the adsorption of srha on the gypsum crystal surface blocking the active sites for gypsum growth in contrast in the presence of colloidal particles the observed induction time of gypsum crystallization either decreases or increases depending on the competitive interplay between the enhancement effect in the nucleation step and the inhibition effect in the subsequent crystal growth step furthermore the formed gypsum crystals in the presence of colloidal particles exhibit a needle like morphology similar to the crystals formed in the absence of any additives our study provides fundamental understanding of gypsum crystallization in feedwaters containing natural organic matter and colloidal particles highlighting the importance of feedwater composition in gypsum scaling graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords inorganic scaling gypsum crystallization gypsum nucleation induction time suwannee river humic acid srha colloidal particles 1 introduction during the past few decades freshwater scarcity has become one of most critical global challenges threatening human survival grant et al 2012 mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 to expand the clean water supply membrane based technologies such as reverse osmosis have been increasingly applied to desalinate seawater industrial wastewaters and brackish groundwaters elimelech and phillip 2011 mcginnis and elimelech 2008 however mineral scaling e g gypsum calcite and barite is a major obstacle limiting the cost effective application of these water treatment technologies tong et al 2019 mineral scaling refers to the precipitation of sparingly soluble salts in solution when their solubility product is exceeded during operation this phenomenon reduces the freshwater productivity of membrane systems and requires chemical and mechanical cleaning operations thereby increasing energy consumption and overall cost mineral scaling is the result of crystallization of ion species in aqueous solutions via precipitation reaction yin et al 2021 the crystallization process includes two stages namely the nucleation stage and the subsequent crystal growth stage according to the classic nucleation theory cnt nucleation can be divided into homogeneous nucleation occurring in the bulk solution and heterogeneous nucleation occurring on a foreign surface e g membrane or particle surfaces van driessche et al 2016 furthermore heterogeneous nucleation takes place more easily than homogeneous nucleation since it has a lower activation energy barrier horseman et al 2021 both homogeneous and heterogeneous nucleation contribute to the formation of mineral scales during membrane desalination processes antony et al 2011 shaffer et al 2017 in the crystal growth stage the primary nuclei become larger through a classic growth route by the attachment of solute species atoms and ions to the nuclei surface s nucleating sites as well as a nonclassic route by oriented attachment or aggregation of a wider range of precursor particles nuclei nanosized crystals and fully developed crystals de yoreo et al 2015 de yoreo and vekilov 2003 ossorio et al 2017 van driessche et al 2016 gypsum calcium sulfate dihydrate caso4 2h2o is one of the most common inorganic scales in membrane desalination systems and heat exchangers gypsum crystallization is affected by other coexisting dissolved species in aqueous solutions such as other ionic species melliti et al 2021 sheikholeslami 2003 xu et al 2019 polymers amjad 1988 amjad and hooley 1986 hasson et al 2011 rabizadeh et al 2019 yin et al 2021 yu et al 2020 and natural organic matter nom benecke et al 2018 le gouellec and elimelech 2002 lin et al 2021 for example it has been shown that poly acrylic acid paa a common antiscalant used in industry significantly inhibits the formation of gypsum crystals rabizadeh et al 2019 notably paa with a molecular weight of 2000 da paa2k decreases the crystallization rate of gypsum to a greater extent than paa with 100 000 da molecular weight paa100k since paa2k may adsorb more strongly on gypsum surface than paa100k it has also been reported that natural organic matter e g humic acid inhibits the formation of gypsum during reverse osmosis desalination benecke et al 2018 and reduces the size of formed gypsum crystals during nanofiltration le gouellec and elimelech 2002 in another recent study it was shown that dissolved humic acid ha in the feedwater delayed gypsum scaling and membrane wetting during membrane distillation md yan et al 2021 similar results for md have recently been reported where ha reduced membrane gypsum scaling and wetting by the formation of a compact protective gypsum ha layer on the membrane surface which prevented scale penetration into the membrane pores wang et al 2022 the possible mechanistic impacts of polymeric inhibitors or nom on gypsum crystallization include i the functional groups of polymers may chelate the ions e g ca2 for gypsum thus making the ions unavailable for scaling i e increasing the solubility of ions ii polymers or nom adsorb on the gypsum crystal surface and block the active sites for crystal growth and iii the adsorption of polymers or nom molecules on crystals may impart electrostatic and or steric repulsion which prevents crystals from aggregating rabizadeh et al 2019 turek et al 2017 gypsum crystallization is also influenced by colloidal or suspended matter in the solution choi et al 2019 hao et al 2019 mady and kelland 2020 wang et al 2010 compared to studies on the effects of dissolved species e g nom on gypsum scaling the effects of colloidal and suspended matter in feedwater have been investigated to a much lesser extent resulting in a limited understanding of their impact on inorganic scaling in a recent study seed particles were added to solutions during the pretreatment step to shorten crystallization induction time by inducing heterogeneous nucleation on seed particles thus promoting the precipitation of sparingly soluble salts choi et al 2019 in another study nano microdust particles in the aqueous medium decreased the induction time for gypsum crystallization compared to the case when the nano microdust in the solution was reduced by membrane filtration oshchepkov et al 2020 however it has also been reported that various types of nanomaterials or nanoparticles were developed as inhibitors or antiscalants for gypsum crystallization mady and kelland 2020 sheikhi et al 2018 for example synthesized carbon quantum dots cqds inhibit the formation of gypsum crystals significantly via chelation with ca2 and the interruption of crystal growth inducted by cqds particles hao et al 2019 these results demonstrate that different types of particles in solution might either promote or inhibit gypsum crystallization natural organic matter and colloidal particles are ubiquitous in feed waters used in engineering systems such as desalination technologies and cooling towers in power plants as discussed above nom and suspended particles significantly influence gypsum crystallization via different mechanisms some of which are not fully understood hence a systematic comparative understanding of the impact of nom and particles will provide valuable insights to further elucidate the mechanisms of inorganic scaling which will lead to the development of more efficient strategies for crystalline scale mitigation in this study we compare the impacts of nom and colloidal particles with different functional surface groups on gypsum crystallization the different behaviors of gypsum crystallization induced by nom and colloidal particles are investigated by comparing the induction times and morphologies of the formed gypsum during gypsum crystallization experiments we also elucidate the mechanisms of gypsum crystallization in the presence of natural organic matter and colloidal particles our study provides fundamental insights to understand gypsum crystallization in different aqueous environments we also reveal for the first time that the overall impact of colloidal particles on gypsum crystallization is the combined result of enhancement during the nucleation stage and inhibition during the crystal growth stage 2 materials and

of the particles 6 mg l in different solution conditions was calculated from the electrophoretic mobility using the smoluchowski equation cao and elimelech 2021 ohshima 2006 electrophoretic mobility measurements were carried out with a nanobrook omni brookhaven instruments for the measurements in the milli q water solution the samples were prepared by adding the particles from a stock solution to milli q water to obtain the final particle concentration of 6 mg l for the electrophoretic mobility measurements in a saturated solution of cacl2 and na2so4 si 6 34 the samples were prepared by mixing the particles with the solution of cacl2 and na2so4 at the desired concentration to achieve an si of 6 34 the measurements were conducted immediately after the sample preparation to avoid the formation of gypsum crystals in the saturated solution 2 4 gypsum crystallization experiments gypsum crystallization experiments at different supersaturation conditions were conducted in a 200ml disposable polypropylene cup solo urbana il for model solutions table s1 in the absence or presence of either nom srha or colloidal particles briefly equal volumes 50 ml of cacl2 2h2o and na2so4 solutions at certain concentrations with or without srha or particles were added simultaneously into the polypropylene container acting as a batch reactor using 50 ml serological pipets the mixed solution was stirred using a 3 cm octagonal teflon coated magnetic stir bar at a rate of 200 rpm unless otherwise noted after completing each experiment the stir bar was cleaned carefully with a brush rinsed with ample milli q water and then dried in the oven 60 induction time t ind is one of the most important parameters to describe a crystallization process it is defined as the time elapsed from the moment when the supersaturation condition is achieved to the moment when the formed crystals are detected in the solution as this definition implies the value of t ind depends on the resolution of the technique used for detecting the formed crystals wang et al 2010 here the induction time was determined by monitoring the intensity of transmitted light of the sample solution using a uv vis spectrophotometer 50 bio cary briefly a small amount 0 9 ml of the mixed solution was taken out of the batch reactor for optical transmittance measurements at a wavelength range of 400 800 nm by uv vis spectroscopy at predetermined time intervals after completing each optical transmittance measurement the sample solution was transferred immediately to the batch reactor the onset of the decrease a decline of 0 5 as the criterion of the averaged light transmittance in the wavelength range of 400 500 nm was defined as the induction time for gypsum crystallization notably light transmittance in the range of 400 500 nm was chosen for data analysis since the change of light transmittance due to the formation of gypsum crystals at lower wavelengths is more significant than that at higher wavelengths wang et al 2010 2 5 characterization of the gypsum crystals to characterize the morphologies of formed gypsum crystals at different aqueous environments 1 ml of the mixed solution was taken from the batch reactor at different experimental times and then was filtered through a polycarbonate track etch membrane with a 0 1 μm pore size using a vacuum filtration setup after filtration 4 ml methanol was filtered through the membrane to remove residual feed solution to prevent additional gypsum formation on the surface of crystals deposited on the membrane surface during the previous filtration step the final membrane was then dried in air at room temperature for sem imaging a small 1 cm2 piece of sample was cut from the dried membrane and coated with a 3 nm thick layer of iridium leica ace600 high vacuum sputter sem images were obtained using hitachi su8230 uhr cold field emission scanning electron microscope sem hitachi high technologies america inc the sem microscope was operated in ultrahigh resolution mode with an accelerating voltage of 10 kv and an emission current of 10 μa the crystalline features of the formed gypsum at different conditions were characterized using powder x ray diffraction xrd rigaku smartlab with cu kα monochromatic radiation xrd patterns were recorded in the angular range of 10 60 with a scan speed of 10 degree min at 40 kv voltage 44 ma current and ambient temperature for sample preparation in the case of gypsum crystallization experiment si 4 92 without adding ha or particles the mixed solution was transferred from the batch reactor to 50 ml centrifuge tubes after a reaction time of 2 hours then the solution was centrifuged for 15 minutes at 10 000 rpm sorvall rc6 plus superspeed centrifuge thermo scientific the solid product obtained after centrifugation was rinsed with 1 ml methanol and dried in air at room temperature a similar sample preparation process was used for gypsum crystallization experiments si 4 92 in the presence of added srha or colloidal particles the times for transferring the mixed solution to centrifuge tubes for gypsum crystallization experiments in the presence of srha and particles were after reaction times of approximately 14 and 4 hours respectively notably different reaction times were used during the above sample preparations because gypsum crystallization experiments with or without ha or particles resulted in different induction times thus we need different reaction times to obtain the appropriate amount of solid product for xrd characterization the local chemical environment of ca element of the formed gypsum was investigated using x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps analysis the xps spectra were collected in a phi versaprobe ii spectrometer with a monochromatic 1486 7 ev al kα x ray source all spectra were referenced to c 1s signal at 284 8 ev from the adventitious carbon and quantified using casaxps version 2 3 24 3 results and discussion 3 1 induction time for gypsum crystallization according to the classic nucleation theory induction time is related to solution supersaturation condition temperature and the presence of interfaces as follows choi et al 2019 he et al 1994 5 log t ind a 16 π γ ln 3 v m 2 n a f θ 3 2 3 r t 3 1 log si 2 where a is a dimensionless constant γ ln is the surface energy of gypsum crystals j m2 v m is the molecular volume of gypsum v m 74 69 cm3 mol n a is avogadro s number mol 1 r is the gas constant j mol 1 k 1 t is the absolute temperature k and f θ is a wetting function serving as a correction factor to account for heterogeneous nucleation söhnel and mullin 1988 for homogeneous nucleation f θ 1 while for heterogeneous nucleation f θ 1 based on eq 5 a plot of log t ind versus 1 log si 2 reveals the dependence of the observed gypsum crystallization induction time on the degree of gypsum supersaturation in the absence of additives fig 1 a data are summarized in table s2 the plot demonstrates that induction time decreases with increasing saturation index si i e moving to the left in the horizontal axis moreover the plot exhibits two distinct linear regions with different slopes as also observed in other studies choi et al 2019 he et al 1994 reznik et al 2012 at high values of gypsum supersaturation conditions e g si 6 12 as shown as the linear region with a steeper slope green color shade homogeneous nucleation is the dominant mechanism for the formation of gypsum crystals this result suggests that homogeneous nucleation would play an important role in membrane scaling when elevated supersaturation is attained at high water recoveries based on eq 5 the gypsum water surface energy γ ln is 17 1 mj m2 calculated from the slope of the steeper line when f θ 1 this value is comparable to values 10 22 mj m2 reported in other gypsum crystallization studies choi et al 2019 reznik et al 2012 at lower values of gypsum supersaturation conditions e g si 6 12 the linear region with a more moderate slope in fig 1a heterogeneous nucleation is the dominant mechanism in the gypsum nucleation stage this heterogeneous nucleation is probably induced by the surface of the polypropylene cups and the stirrer used in the experiments and or inevitable impurities in the solution oshchepkov et al 2020 sear 2006 representative profiles of the change in light transmittance of the solutions versus time at different gypsum saturation conditions are shown in fig 1b these profiles indicate that the intensity of light transmittance at high gypsum saturation conditions decreases much faster than that at lower gypsum saturation conditions this observation is reasonable since the intensity of light transmittance is inversely proportional to the number and size of the crystals formed overall our results indicate that the crystallization rate is proportional to the saturation index si van driessche et al 2016 3 2 impact of suwannee river humic acid on gypsum crystallization next we investigated the impact of suwannee river humic acid srha on gypsum crystallization at different supersaturation conditions srha served as a model for natural organic matter which is ubiquitous in feed waters for engineered systems such as seawater and brackish water reverse osmosis desalination srha has been used extensively as a model natural organic matter in a wide range of studies such as particle aggregation saleh et al 2010 and membrane fouling boo et al 2018 because it was extracted from a surface water source and is well characterized averett et al 1994 redwood et al 2005 based on the above discussion gypsum crystallization is expected to be dominated by homogeneous crystallization at high supersaturation conditions si 6 12 and heterogeneous crystallization at si 6 12 thus three different saturation conditions i e si 6 34 5 75 and 4 92 were chosen for gypsum crystallization experiments in the presence of srha we quantified the impact of crystallization by determining the relative induction time defined as the induction time in the presence of additives here srha compared to that in the absence of additives as shown in fig 2 the relative induction time for gypsum crystallization at a given si condition increases greatly with increased shra concentration for example for si of 6 34 the relative induction time increases from 1 to 3 3 when the srha concentration increases from 0 to 6 mg l respectively this observation indicates that srha exhibits a strong inhibitory effect on gypsum crystallization which is generally consistent with observations reported in the literature benecke et al 2018 hamdona and hadad 2008 yin et al 2021 we attribute the inhibition of crystallization to srha adsorption onto the surface of gypsum nuclei or crystals and subsequent blocking of active growth sites benecke et al 2018 dobberschütz et al 2018 sheikholeslami 2003 the adsorption of shra is likely enhanced by the interaction of carboxyl groups of srha with calcium ions embedded on the gypsum surface israelachvili 2015 yin et al 2021 the inhibition effect induced by srha becomes more significant for lower saturation conditions fig 2 for example the relative induction time increases from 3 3 to 6 5 when si decreases from 6 34 to 4 92 respectively in the presence of 6 mg l srha according to classic nucleation theory nucleation rate is proportional to the supersaturation degree moreover heterogeneous nucleation is dominant over homogeneous nucleation during gypsum crystallization at relatively moderate si conditions si 6 12 as a result a smaller number of gypsum nuclei or crystals are formed in the solution at a lower si condition and their growth process is influenced to a larger extent at a given srha concentration compared to the case at higher si the above results suggest that in real world applications srha may play a more important role at the initial stages of gypsum scaling when supersaturation condition is just reached compared to the later stages when a high level of supersaturation is attained such as in high recovery brackish water desalination 3 3 impact of colloidal particles on gypsum crystallization to study the effect of particles on gypsum crystallization we used four different types of commercial polystyrene latex particles amidine modified al sulfate modified sl carboxyl modified cl and unmodified latex ps the size and properties of these particles are summarized in table 1 because of their well defined properties polystyrene latex particles have been used as a model for colloidal and suspended particles in aquatic environments alimi et al 2018 elimelech 1991 peydayesh et al 2021 we further note that various types of carbon based particulate materials have also been used as antiscalants for mineral scaling hao et al 2019 mady and kelland 2020 as depicted in fig 3 a at a relatively high supersaturation condition si 6 34 the relative induction time decreases with increasing concentration of colloidal particles over the range of 0 to 6 mg l this relationship indicates that colloidal particles can promote the gypsum crystallization process we attribute this promotion effect to the additional sites for heterogeneous nucleation of gypsum provided by the colloidal particles choi et al 2019 at an intermediate supersaturation condition si 5 75 fig 3b as the particle concentration increases the relative induction times for the cases in the presence of the ps sl and cl particles first decrease reaching a minimum at particle concentration between 1 and 2 mg l and then increase continuously as we observe these three types of particles promote gypsum crystallization at low particle concentrations while inhibiting the crystallization process at relatively high particle concentrations at a relatively low supersaturation condition si 4 92 fig 3c the relative induction times increase significantly with increasing particle concentration indicating that colloidal particles promote the gypsum crystallization process over the entire particle concentration range these results suggest that suspended particles or particulate antiscalants may have different impacts on gypsum scaling as supersaturation conditions change during different stages of the water treatment operation notably for the crystallization experiments in the presence of al particles the relative induction time changes in a different way for each of the three supersaturation conditions compared to the cases with the other three types of particles these observed differences in the behavior of induction times with al particles compared to the other three types of particles indicate that the surface charge of particles plays a more important role in affecting gypsum crystallization than the functional groups on the particle surface as we can see in table 1 the al particles are positively charged while the other particles are negatively charged we discuss the mechanisms of crystallization in the presence of particles and srha in detail in the following subsections 3 4 morphology and crystalline features of gypsum crystals the morphological features of the formed gypsum crystals in the absence or presence of srha or colloidal particles were characterized by sem fig 4 for the control gypsum crystallization experiments in the absence of additives si 4 92 the formed gypsum crystals exhibit a characteristic needle like shape with a large length to width ratio of at least 20 fig 4a c both the number and size of crystals increase as time passes furthermore the xrd pattern of gypsum crystals formed in the control experiments exhibits characteristic peaks that correspond to the 020 021 040 and 041 crystal facets fig 5 a rabizadeh et al 2020 in contrast when srha 6 mg l was present in solution the formed gypsum crystals had a polygon like shape including hexagon and pentagon with a small length to width ratio of approximately 2 fig 4d f these observations indicate that srha molecules distorted the formation of gypsum crystals markedly via changing the favorable direction of crystal growth yin et al 2021 this distortion of srha on gypsum crystal growth can be further proved by xrd analysis as shown in fig 5a the intensity of characteristic peaks for the 020 and 040 facets of gypsum crystals is remarkably reduced this finding is likely attributed to the preferential adsorption of srha on these facets resulting in morphology change of the formed gypsum via inhibition of the crystal growth at the corresponding orientations yin et al 2021 notably the xps spectra of ca element in the formed gypsum display no shift in the binding energies of ca 2p1 2 and ca 2p3 2 in the absence or presence of srha and particles fig 5b this result implies that although srha adsorbs onto the gypsum surface causing morphological distortion of the crystal no chemical binding occurs between calcium and srha molecules in addition over time the number and size of gypsum crystals increase fig 4d f although this rate of increase is much smaller than that in the control gypsum crystallization experiments fig 4a c these results indicate that srha can inhibit gypsum scaling although it has the potential to cause fouling in membrane based desalination processes guan et al 2018 considering that rigid colloidal particles cannot adsorb onto or cover the gypsum crystal surface as the flexible ha molecules we assume that colloidal particles with different functional groups would have a similar effect on the morphology of the formed gypsum crystals thus we chose unmodified surfactant free polystyrene ps particles as representative colloidal particles the results showed that when ps colloidal particles 6 mg l were added to the solution the formed gypsum crystals had a needle like shape similar to crystals formed in the control gypsum crystallization experiments fig 4g i these results clearly indicate that colloidal particles do not change the morphology of crystals and the preferable orientation of crystal growth the formed gypsum crystals present an xrd pattern similar to that formed in the control experiments fig 5a collectively the above observations on gypsum morphology and crystalline features suggest that the srha alters the crystal morphology and crystal growth orientations and suppresses the gypsum crystallization rate significantly on the other hand colloidal particles exhibit a much weaker effect understanding these different impacts of srha and colloidal particles on gypsum crystallization is important since the morphology crystalline features and the mass related to crystallization rate of gypsum precipitates specifically contribute to scaling and performance deterioration of desalination membranes and other engineered systems wang et al 2021 3 5 proposed gypsum crystallization mechanisms gypsum crystallization involves nucleation and subsequent crystal growth the nucleation step involves homogeneous nucleation in the bulk solution and heterogeneous nucleation on surfaces the formed nuclei or nanosized crystals grow to micrometer sized crystal particles through the attachment of solutes on the surface nucleating sites and the oriented attachment or aggregation of various precursor particles nuclei nanosized crystals and fully developed crystals stawski et al 2016 van driessche et al 2016 during gypsum crystallization experiments in the absence of additives needle like crystals are formed due to the integration of solute species on surface growth sites especially the dominant integration in the most reactive facets mbogoro et al 2017 further the oriented attachment of relatively small gypsum crystal particles also plays an important role in the gypsum growth stage as illustrated in fig 6 a one needle like gypsum crystal results from the directional attachment or assembly of several individual sub crystals for gypsum crystallization experiments in the presence of srha polygon like crystals are formed due to the disruption by srha molecules the more negative zeta potential of gypsum in the presence of srha indicates the adsorption of srha on the gypsum surface which is likely due to the affinity of carboxyl groups of srha to calcium ions embedded on the gypsum surface yin et al 2021 following adsorption the srha molecules block the active growth sites thus preventing the attachment of ion species further the crystal growth along the orientations of the most reactive facets is suppressed resulting in distinct polygon like shaped crystals rather than the characteristic needle like shape in additive free experiments fig 6b as observed in fig 6b the formed gypsum crystal surface possesses rough step edges or stacked layers markedly different from the relatively smooth surface seen in the additive free gypsum crystallization experiments these findings are generally consistent with previous studies in which macromolecules containing carboxylic functional groups inhibited gypsum crystallization and altered the morphologies of the formed crystals popov et al 2016 rahman 2013 yin et al 2021 the promotion effect of colloidal particles on gypsum crystallization at a relatively high si condition fig 3a can be attributed to heterogeneous nucleation induced by the added colloidal particles as depicted in fig s1a the particles provide additional sites for heterogeneous nucleation which is more energy favorable than homogeneous nucleation in the bulk solution choi et al 2019 van driessche et al 2016 further the formed gypsum on the surface of particles might detach from the particle surface into the bulk solution during the gypsum growth stage since no gypsum colloidal particle hybrid composites are observed in the sem images notably the al particles have a weaker impact on gypsum crystallization compared to the other three types of particles a possible reason for this observation is the stronger electrostatic interactions between the positively charged al particles and negatively charged gypsum crystals compared to those with the other three types of negatively charged particles sl cl and ps surface charge is summarized in table 1 as a result the detachment of gypsum nuclei or crystals from al particle surfaces to the bulk solution is less likely to occur than that with the other three types of particles this hypothesis is consistent with the results of the change in light transmittance fig s1b the light transmittance proportional to number and size of particles in the case of al particles decreases more slowly than that in the case of sl particles which may indicate that a smaller number of gypsum crystals are formed in the bulk solution in the presence of al particles compared to that in the case of sl particles wang et al 2010 the inhibition effect of colloidal particles on the observed induction time of gypsum crystallization is attributed to the interruption of the oriented aggregation of gypsum crystals fig 6c as discussed above the oriented attachment or aggregation of gypsum crystals plays an important role during the gypsum growth stage the added colloidal particles collide with gypsum crystals and interfere with the oriented aggregation of gypsum crystals by providing a steric like repulsion between them thus gypsum growth is inhibited leading to a longer induction time an inhibitory effect of added particles on crystal growth has also been reported in a previous study hao et al 2019 this inhibition mechanism induced by colloidal particles is further verified by gypsum crystallization experiments under different stirring speed conditions fig s2 with increasing stirring speed the induction time increases only slightly in the absence of colloidal particles while it increases significantly in the presence of colloidal particles we attribute the latter observation to the increased collision rate between colloidal particles and gypsum crystals at higher stirring speeds thus enhancing the disruption of added particles on the oriented attachment of gypsum crystals we note that this inhibition of gypsum crystallization is also observed with larger particles 5 μm in diameter at higher particle mass concentrations than the small size particles fig s3 based on the above discussion we conclude that the overall impact of colloidal particles on gypsum crystallization is determined by the combined enhancement effect in the nucleation step and the inhibition effect in the subsequent crystal growth step for example at a relatively high si si 6 34 the induction time is shortened since the enhancement effect in the nucleation stage is dominant fig 3a while at lower si si 5 75 or 4 92 the overall crystallization induction time is increased because the inhibition effect on crystal growth induced by colloidal particles becomes more significant 4 conclusion we performed the first comparison of the impact of natural organic matter specifically srha and colloidal particles on gypsum crystallization srha with its abundant carboxyl groups not only prolongs the observed induction time of gypsum crystallization but also changes the morphology and crystal growth orientation of the formed gypsum crystals due to the adsorption of srha molecules on the gypsum surface these results suggest that scaling control may be achieved by tailoring the molecular structure of polymeric antiscalants to achieve strong adsorption on crystalline scale surfaces in contrast colloidal particles do not change the crystal morphology but alter the observed induction time of gypsum crystallization in a more complex way the overall impact of colloidal particles on the gypsum crystallization induction time is determined by a competition between the enhancement effect during the nucleation step via heterogeneous nucleation and the inhibition effect in the subsequent crystal growth step through the disruption of oriented attachment of gypsum crystals therefore it might be necessary to consider these two opposite impacts when evaluating the performance of novel particulate antiscalants at different saturation conditions the effect of particulate antiscalants on gypsum crystallization is also related to their size distribution we note however that both natural organic matter and colloidal particles induce surface fouling in membrane desalination and other engineered systems lee et al 2005 quay et al 2018 future studies on the combined effects of fouling and scaling should be conducted to optimize the fouling and scaling control methods overall our study provides fundamental insights into the mechanisms of gypsum scale formation with different feedwaters that can lead to the development of novel antiscalants and scale

15996,gypsum scaling via crystallization is a major obstacle limiting the applications of membrane based technologies and heat exchangers in engineered systems herein we perform the first comparative investigation on the impacts of natural organic matter suwannee river humic acid srha and colloidal particles on the gypsum crystallization process in terms of induction time and crystal morphology results show that the presence of srha significantly increases the induction time of gypsum crystallization specifically at a solution saturation index of 4 92 the induction time increases 6 5 fold in the presence of 6 mg l srha compared to the case without srha srha also alters the morphology of the formed calcium sulfate crystals resulting in a polygon like shape differing from the characteristic needle like shape of gypsum in the absence of additives these changes in crystal morphology are attributed to the adsorption of srha on the gypsum crystal surface blocking the active sites for gypsum growth in contrast in the presence of colloidal particles the observed induction time of gypsum crystallization either decreases or increases depending on the competitive interplay between the enhancement effect in the nucleation step and the inhibition effect in the subsequent crystal growth step furthermore the formed gypsum crystals in the presence of colloidal particles exhibit a needle like morphology similar to the crystals formed in the absence of any additives our study provides fundamental understanding of gypsum crystallization in feedwaters containing natural organic matter and colloidal particles highlighting the importance of feedwater composition in gypsum scaling graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords inorganic scaling gypsum crystallization gypsum nucleation induction time suwannee river humic acid srha colloidal particles 1 introduction during the past few decades freshwater scarcity has become one of most critical global challenges threatening human survival grant et al 2012 mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 to expand the clean water supply membrane based technologies such as reverse osmosis have been increasingly applied to desalinate seawater industrial wastewaters and brackish groundwaters elimelech and phillip 2011 mcginnis and elimelech 2008 however mineral scaling e g gypsum calcite and barite is a major obstacle limiting the cost effective application of these water treatment technologies tong et al 2019 mineral scaling refers to the precipitation of sparingly soluble salts in solution when their solubility product is exceeded during operation this phenomenon reduces the freshwater productivity of membrane systems and requires chemical and mechanical cleaning operations thereby increasing energy consumption and overall cost mineral scaling is the result of crystallization of ion species in aqueous solutions via precipitation reaction yin et al 2021 the crystallization process includes two stages namely the nucleation stage and the subsequent crystal growth stage according to the classic nucleation theory cnt nucleation can be divided into homogeneous nucleation occurring in the bulk solution and heterogeneous nucleation occurring on a foreign surface e g membrane or particle surfaces van driessche et al 2016 furthermore heterogeneous nucleation takes place more easily than homogeneous nucleation since it has a lower activation energy barrier horseman et al 2021 both homogeneous and heterogeneous nucleation contribute to the formation of mineral scales during membrane desalination processes antony et al 2011 shaffer et al 2017 in the crystal growth stage the primary nuclei become larger through a classic growth route by the attachment of solute species atoms and ions to the nuclei surface s nucleating sites as well as a nonclassic route by oriented attachment or aggregation of a wider range of precursor particles nuclei nanosized crystals and fully developed crystals de yoreo et al 2015 de yoreo and vekilov 2003 ossorio et al 2017 van driessche et al 2016 gypsum calcium sulfate dihydrate caso4 2h2o is one of the most common inorganic scales in membrane desalination systems and heat exchangers gypsum crystallization is affected by other coexisting dissolved species in aqueous solutions such as other ionic species melliti et al 2021 sheikholeslami 2003 xu et al 2019 polymers amjad 1988 amjad and hooley 1986 hasson et al 2011 rabizadeh et al 2019 yin et al 2021 yu et al 2020 and natural organic matter nom benecke et al 2018 le gouellec and elimelech 2002 lin et al 2021 for example it has been shown that poly acrylic acid paa a common antiscalant used in industry significantly inhibits the formation of gypsum crystals rabizadeh et al 2019 notably paa with a molecular weight of 2000 da paa2k decreases the crystallization rate of gypsum to a greater extent than paa with 100 000 da molecular weight paa100k since paa2k may adsorb more strongly on gypsum surface than paa100k it has also been reported that natural organic matter e g humic acid inhibits the formation of gypsum during reverse osmosis desalination benecke et al 2018 and reduces the size of formed gypsum crystals during nanofiltration le gouellec and elimelech 2002 in another recent study it was shown that dissolved humic acid ha in the feedwater delayed gypsum scaling and membrane wetting during membrane distillation md yan et al 2021 similar results for md have recently been reported where ha reduced membrane gypsum scaling and wetting by the formation of a compact protective gypsum ha layer on the membrane surface which prevented scale penetration into the membrane pores wang et al 2022 the possible mechanistic impacts of polymeric inhibitors or nom on gypsum crystallization include i the functional groups of polymers may chelate the ions e g ca2 for gypsum thus making the ions unavailable for scaling i e increasing the solubility of ions ii polymers or nom adsorb on the gypsum crystal surface and block the active sites for crystal growth and iii the adsorption of polymers or nom molecules on crystals may impart electrostatic and or steric repulsion which prevents crystals from aggregating rabizadeh et al 2019 turek et al 2017 gypsum crystallization is also influenced by colloidal or suspended matter in the solution choi et al 2019 hao et al 2019 mady and kelland 2020 wang et al 2010 compared to studies on the effects of dissolved species e g nom on gypsum scaling the effects of colloidal and suspended matter in feedwater have been investigated to a much lesser extent resulting in a limited understanding of their impact on inorganic scaling in a recent study seed particles were added to solutions during the pretreatment step to shorten crystallization induction time by inducing heterogeneous nucleation on seed particles thus promoting the precipitation of sparingly soluble salts choi et al 2019 in another study nano microdust particles in the aqueous medium decreased the induction time for gypsum crystallization compared to the case when the nano microdust in the solution was reduced by membrane filtration oshchepkov et al 2020 however it has also been reported that various types of nanomaterials or nanoparticles were developed as inhibitors or antiscalants for gypsum crystallization mady and kelland 2020 sheikhi et al 2018 for example synthesized carbon quantum dots cqds inhibit the formation of gypsum crystals significantly via chelation with ca2 and the interruption of crystal growth inducted by cqds particles hao et al 2019 these results demonstrate that different types of particles in solution might either promote or inhibit gypsum crystallization natural organic matter and colloidal particles are ubiquitous in feed waters used in engineering systems such as desalination technologies and cooling towers in power plants as discussed above nom and suspended particles significantly influence gypsum crystallization via different mechanisms some of which are not fully understood hence a systematic comparative understanding of the impact of nom and particles will provide valuable insights to further elucidate the mechanisms of inorganic scaling which will lead to the development of more efficient strategies for crystalline scale mitigation in this study we compare the impacts of nom and colloidal particles with different functional surface groups on gypsum crystallization the different behaviors of gypsum crystallization induced by nom and colloidal particles are investigated by comparing the induction times and morphologies of the formed gypsum during gypsum crystallization experiments we also elucidate the mechanisms of gypsum crystallization in the presence of natural organic matter and colloidal particles our study provides fundamental insights to understand gypsum crystallization in different aqueous environments we also reveal for the first time that the overall impact of colloidal particles on gypsum crystallization is the combined result of enhancement during the nucleation stage and inhibition during the crystal growth stage 2 materials and

of the particles 6 mg l in different solution conditions was calculated from the electrophoretic mobility using the smoluchowski equation cao and elimelech 2021 ohshima 2006 electrophoretic mobility measurements were carried out with a nanobrook omni brookhaven instruments for the measurements in the milli q water solution the samples were prepared by adding the particles from a stock solution to milli q water to obtain the final particle concentration of 6 mg l for the electrophoretic mobility measurements in a saturated solution of cacl2 and na2so4 si 6 34 the samples were prepared by mixing the particles with the solution of cacl2 and na2so4 at the desired concentration to achieve an si of 6 34 the measurements were conducted immediately after the sample preparation to avoid the formation of gypsum crystals in the saturated solution 2 4 gypsum crystallization experiments gypsum crystallization experiments at different supersaturation conditions were conducted in a 200ml disposable polypropylene cup solo urbana il for model solutions table s1 in the absence or presence of either nom srha or colloidal particles briefly equal volumes 50 ml of cacl2 2h2o and na2so4 solutions at certain concentrations with or without srha or particles were added simultaneously into the polypropylene container acting as a batch reactor using 50 ml serological pipets the mixed solution was stirred using a 3 cm octagonal teflon coated magnetic stir bar at a rate of 200 rpm unless otherwise noted after completing each experiment the stir bar was cleaned carefully with a brush rinsed with ample milli q water and then dried in the oven 60 induction time t ind is one of the most important parameters to describe a crystallization process it is defined as the time elapsed from the moment when the supersaturation condition is achieved to the moment when the formed crystals are detected in the solution as this definition implies the value of t ind depends on the resolution of the technique used for detecting the formed crystals wang et al 2010 here the induction time was determined by monitoring the intensity of transmitted light of the sample solution using a uv vis spectrophotometer 50 bio cary briefly a small amount 0 9 ml of the mixed solution was taken out of the batch reactor for optical transmittance measurements at a wavelength range of 400 800 nm by uv vis spectroscopy at predetermined time intervals after completing each optical transmittance measurement the sample solution was transferred immediately to the batch reactor the onset of the decrease a decline of 0 5 as the criterion of the averaged light transmittance in the wavelength range of 400 500 nm was defined as the induction time for gypsum crystallization notably light transmittance in the range of 400 500 nm was chosen for data analysis since the change of light transmittance due to the formation of gypsum crystals at lower wavelengths is more significant than that at higher wavelengths wang et al 2010 2 5 characterization of the gypsum crystals to characterize the morphologies of formed gypsum crystals at different aqueous environments 1 ml of the mixed solution was taken from the batch reactor at different experimental times and then was filtered through a polycarbonate track etch membrane with a 0 1 μm pore size using a vacuum filtration setup after filtration 4 ml methanol was filtered through the membrane to remove residual feed solution to prevent additional gypsum formation on the surface of crystals deposited on the membrane surface during the previous filtration step the final membrane was then dried in air at room temperature for sem imaging a small 1 cm2 piece of sample was cut from the dried membrane and coated with a 3 nm thick layer of iridium leica ace600 high vacuum sputter sem images were obtained using hitachi su8230 uhr cold field emission scanning electron microscope sem hitachi high technologies america inc the sem microscope was operated in ultrahigh resolution mode with an accelerating voltage of 10 kv and an emission current of 10 μa the crystalline features of the formed gypsum at different conditions were characterized using powder x ray diffraction xrd rigaku smartlab with cu kα monochromatic radiation xrd patterns were recorded in the angular range of 10 60 with a scan speed of 10 degree min at 40 kv voltage 44 ma current and ambient temperature for sample preparation in the case of gypsum crystallization experiment si 4 92 without adding ha or particles the mixed solution was transferred from the batch reactor to 50 ml centrifuge tubes after a reaction time of 2 hours then the solution was centrifuged for 15 minutes at 10 000 rpm sorvall rc6 plus superspeed centrifuge thermo scientific the solid product obtained after centrifugation was rinsed with 1 ml methanol and dried in air at room temperature a similar sample preparation process was used for gypsum crystallization experiments si 4 92 in the presence of added srha or colloidal particles the times for transferring the mixed solution to centrifuge tubes for gypsum crystallization experiments in the presence of srha and particles were after reaction times of approximately 14 and 4 hours respectively notably different reaction times were used during the above sample preparations because gypsum crystallization experiments with or without ha or particles resulted in different induction times thus we need different reaction times to obtain the appropriate amount of solid product for xrd characterization the local chemical environment of ca element of the formed gypsum was investigated using x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps analysis the xps spectra were collected in a phi versaprobe ii spectrometer with a monochromatic 1486 7 ev al kα x ray source all spectra were referenced to c 1s signal at 284 8 ev from the adventitious carbon and quantified using casaxps version 2 3 24 3 results and discussion 3 1 induction time for gypsum crystallization according to the classic nucleation theory induction time is related to solution supersaturation condition temperature and the presence of interfaces as follows choi et al 2019 he et al 1994 5 log t ind a 16 π γ ln 3 v m 2 n a f θ 3 2 3 r t 3 1 log si 2 where a is a dimensionless constant γ ln is the surface energy of gypsum crystals j m2 v m is the molecular volume of gypsum v m 74 69 cm3 mol n a is avogadro s number mol 1 r is the gas constant j mol 1 k 1 t is the absolute temperature k and f θ is a wetting function serving as a correction factor to account for heterogeneous nucleation söhnel and mullin 1988 for homogeneous nucleation f θ 1 while for heterogeneous nucleation f θ 1 based on eq 5 a plot of log t ind versus 1 log si 2 reveals the dependence of the observed gypsum crystallization induction time on the degree of gypsum supersaturation in the absence of additives fig 1 a data are summarized in table s2 the plot demonstrates that induction time decreases with increasing saturation index si i e moving to the left in the horizontal axis moreover the plot exhibits two distinct linear regions with different slopes as also observed in other studies choi et al 2019 he et al 1994 reznik et al 2012 at high values of gypsum supersaturation conditions e g si 6 12 as shown as the linear region with a steeper slope green color shade homogeneous nucleation is the dominant mechanism for the formation of gypsum crystals this result suggests that homogeneous nucleation would play an important role in membrane scaling when elevated supersaturation is attained at high water recoveries based on eq 5 the gypsum water surface energy γ ln is 17 1 mj m2 calculated from the slope of the steeper line when f θ 1 this value is comparable to values 10 22 mj m2 reported in other gypsum crystallization studies choi et al 2019 reznik et al 2012 at lower values of gypsum supersaturation conditions e g si 6 12 the linear region with a more moderate slope in fig 1a heterogeneous nucleation is the dominant mechanism in the gypsum nucleation stage this heterogeneous nucleation is probably induced by the surface of the polypropylene cups and the stirrer used in the experiments and or inevitable impurities in the solution oshchepkov et al 2020 sear 2006 representative profiles of the change in light transmittance of the solutions versus time at different gypsum saturation conditions are shown in fig 1b these profiles indicate that the intensity of light transmittance at high gypsum saturation conditions decreases much faster than that at lower gypsum saturation conditions this observation is reasonable since the intensity of light transmittance is inversely proportional to the number and size of the crystals formed overall our results indicate that the crystallization rate is proportional to the saturation index si van driessche et al 2016 3 2 impact of suwannee river humic acid on gypsum crystallization next we investigated the impact of suwannee river humic acid srha on gypsum crystallization at different supersaturation conditions srha served as a model for natural organic matter which is ubiquitous in feed waters for engineered systems such as seawater and brackish water reverse osmosis desalination srha has been used extensively as a model natural organic matter in a wide range of studies such as particle aggregation saleh et al 2010 and membrane fouling boo et al 2018 because it was extracted from a surface water source and is well characterized averett et al 1994 redwood et al 2005 based on the above discussion gypsum crystallization is expected to be dominated by homogeneous crystallization at high supersaturation conditions si 6 12 and heterogeneous crystallization at si 6 12 thus three different saturation conditions i e si 6 34 5 75 and 4 92 were chosen for gypsum crystallization experiments in the presence of srha we quantified the impact of crystallization by determining the relative induction time defined as the induction time in the presence of additives here srha compared to that in the absence of additives as shown in fig 2 the relative induction time for gypsum crystallization at a given si condition increases greatly with increased shra concentration for example for si of 6 34 the relative induction time increases from 1 to 3 3 when the srha concentration increases from 0 to 6 mg l respectively this observation indicates that srha exhibits a strong inhibitory effect on gypsum crystallization which is generally consistent with observations reported in the literature benecke et al 2018 hamdona and hadad 2008 yin et al 2021 we attribute the inhibition of crystallization to srha adsorption onto the surface of gypsum nuclei or crystals and subsequent blocking of active growth sites benecke et al 2018 dobberschütz et al 2018 sheikholeslami 2003 the adsorption of shra is likely enhanced by the interaction of carboxyl groups of srha with calcium ions embedded on the gypsum surface israelachvili 2015 yin et al 2021 the inhibition effect induced by srha becomes more significant for lower saturation conditions fig 2 for example the relative induction time increases from 3 3 to 6 5 when si decreases from 6 34 to 4 92 respectively in the presence of 6 mg l srha according to classic nucleation theory nucleation rate is proportional to the supersaturation degree moreover heterogeneous nucleation is dominant over homogeneous nucleation during gypsum crystallization at relatively moderate si conditions si 6 12 as a result a smaller number of gypsum nuclei or crystals are formed in the solution at a lower si condition and their growth process is influenced to a larger extent at a given srha concentration compared to the case at higher si the above results suggest that in real world applications srha may play a more important role at the initial stages of gypsum scaling when supersaturation condition is just reached compared to the later stages when a high level of supersaturation is attained such as in high recovery brackish water desalination 3 3 impact of colloidal particles on gypsum crystallization to study the effect of particles on gypsum crystallization we used four different types of commercial polystyrene latex particles amidine modified al sulfate modified sl carboxyl modified cl and unmodified latex ps the size and properties of these particles are summarized in table 1 because of their well defined properties polystyrene latex particles have been used as a model for colloidal and suspended particles in aquatic environments alimi et al 2018 elimelech 1991 peydayesh et al 2021 we further note that various types of carbon based particulate materials have also been used as antiscalants for mineral scaling hao et al 2019 mady and kelland 2020 as depicted in fig 3 a at a relatively high supersaturation condition si 6 34 the relative induction time decreases with increasing concentration of colloidal particles over the range of 0 to 6 mg l this relationship indicates that colloidal particles can promote the gypsum crystallization process we attribute this promotion effect to the additional sites for heterogeneous nucleation of gypsum provided by the colloidal particles choi et al 2019 at an intermediate supersaturation condition si 5 75 fig 3b as the particle concentration increases the relative induction times for the cases in the presence of the ps sl and cl particles first decrease reaching a minimum at particle concentration between 1 and 2 mg l and then increase continuously as we observe these three types of particles promote gypsum crystallization at low particle concentrations while inhibiting the crystallization process at relatively high particle concentrations at a relatively low supersaturation condition si 4 92 fig 3c the relative induction times increase significantly with increasing particle concentration indicating that colloidal particles promote the gypsum crystallization process over the entire particle concentration range these results suggest that suspended particles or particulate antiscalants may have different impacts on gypsum scaling as supersaturation conditions change during different stages of the water treatment operation notably for the crystallization experiments in the presence of al particles the relative induction time changes in a different way for each of the three supersaturation conditions compared to the cases with the other three types of particles these observed differences in the behavior of induction times with al particles compared to the other three types of particles indicate that the surface charge of particles plays a more important role in affecting gypsum crystallization than the functional groups on the particle surface as we can see in table 1 the al particles are positively charged while the other particles are negatively charged we discuss the mechanisms of crystallization in the presence of particles and srha in detail in the following subsections 3 4 morphology and crystalline features of gypsum crystals the morphological features of the formed gypsum crystals in the absence or presence of srha or colloidal particles were characterized by sem fig 4 for the control gypsum crystallization experiments in the absence of additives si 4 92 the formed gypsum crystals exhibit a characteristic needle like shape with a large length to width ratio of at least 20 fig 4a c both the number and size of crystals increase as time passes furthermore the xrd pattern of gypsum crystals formed in the control experiments exhibits characteristic peaks that correspond to the 020 021 040 and 041 crystal facets fig 5 a rabizadeh et al 2020 in contrast when srha 6 mg l was present in solution the formed gypsum crystals had a polygon like shape including hexagon and pentagon with a small length to width ratio of approximately 2 fig 4d f these observations indicate that srha molecules distorted the formation of gypsum crystals markedly via changing the favorable direction of crystal growth yin et al 2021 this distortion of srha on gypsum crystal growth can be further proved by xrd analysis as shown in fig 5a the intensity of characteristic peaks for the 020 and 040 facets of gypsum crystals is remarkably reduced this finding is likely attributed to the preferential adsorption of srha on these facets resulting in morphology change of the formed gypsum via inhibition of the crystal growth at the corresponding orientations yin et al 2021 notably the xps spectra of ca element in the formed gypsum display no shift in the binding energies of ca 2p1 2 and ca 2p3 2 in the absence or presence of srha and particles fig 5b this result implies that although srha adsorbs onto the gypsum surface causing morphological distortion of the crystal no chemical binding occurs between calcium and srha molecules in addition over time the number and size of gypsum crystals increase fig 4d f although this rate of increase is much smaller than that in the control gypsum crystallization experiments fig 4a c these results indicate that srha can inhibit gypsum scaling although it has the potential to cause fouling in membrane based desalination processes guan et al 2018 considering that rigid colloidal particles cannot adsorb onto or cover the gypsum crystal surface as the flexible ha molecules we assume that colloidal particles with different functional groups would have a similar effect on the morphology of the formed gypsum crystals thus we chose unmodified surfactant free polystyrene ps particles as representative colloidal particles the results showed that when ps colloidal particles 6 mg l were added to the solution the formed gypsum crystals had a needle like shape similar to crystals formed in the control gypsum crystallization experiments fig 4g i these results clearly indicate that colloidal particles do not change the morphology of crystals and the preferable orientation of crystal growth the formed gypsum crystals present an xrd pattern similar to that formed in the control experiments fig 5a collectively the above observations on gypsum morphology and crystalline features suggest that the srha alters the crystal morphology and crystal growth orientations and suppresses the gypsum crystallization rate significantly on the other hand colloidal particles exhibit a much weaker effect understanding these different impacts of srha and colloidal particles on gypsum crystallization is important since the morphology crystalline features and the mass related to crystallization rate of gypsum precipitates specifically contribute to scaling and performance deterioration of desalination membranes and other engineered systems wang et al 2021 3 5 proposed gypsum crystallization mechanisms gypsum crystallization involves nucleation and subsequent crystal growth the nucleation step involves homogeneous nucleation in the bulk solution and heterogeneous nucleation on surfaces the formed nuclei or nanosized crystals grow to micrometer sized crystal particles through the attachment of solutes on the surface nucleating sites and the oriented attachment or aggregation of various precursor particles nuclei nanosized crystals and fully developed crystals stawski et al 2016 van driessche et al 2016 during gypsum crystallization experiments in the absence of additives needle like crystals are formed due to the integration of solute species on surface growth sites especially the dominant integration in the most reactive facets mbogoro et al 2017 further the oriented attachment of relatively small gypsum crystal particles also plays an important role in the gypsum growth stage as illustrated in fig 6 a one needle like gypsum crystal results from the directional attachment or assembly of several individual sub crystals for gypsum crystallization experiments in the presence of srha polygon like crystals are formed due to the disruption by srha molecules the more negative zeta potential of gypsum in the presence of srha indicates the adsorption of srha on the gypsum surface which is likely due to the affinity of carboxyl groups of srha to calcium ions embedded on the gypsum surface yin et al 2021 following adsorption the srha molecules block the active growth sites thus preventing the attachment of ion species further the crystal growth along the orientations of the most reactive facets is suppressed resulting in distinct polygon like shaped crystals rather than the characteristic needle like shape in additive free experiments fig 6b as observed in fig 6b the formed gypsum crystal surface possesses rough step edges or stacked layers markedly different from the relatively smooth surface seen in the additive free gypsum crystallization experiments these findings are generally consistent with previous studies in which macromolecules containing carboxylic functional groups inhibited gypsum crystallization and altered the morphologies of the formed crystals popov et al 2016 rahman 2013 yin et al 2021 the promotion effect of colloidal particles on gypsum crystallization at a relatively high si condition fig 3a can be attributed to heterogeneous nucleation induced by the added colloidal particles as depicted in fig s1a the particles provide additional sites for heterogeneous nucleation which is more energy favorable than homogeneous nucleation in the bulk solution choi et al 2019 van driessche et al 2016 further the formed gypsum on the surface of particles might detach from the particle surface into the bulk solution during the gypsum growth stage since no gypsum colloidal particle hybrid composites are observed in the sem images notably the al particles have a weaker impact on gypsum crystallization compared to the other three types of particles a possible reason for this observation is the stronger electrostatic interactions between the positively charged al particles and negatively charged gypsum crystals compared to those with the other three types of negatively charged particles sl cl and ps surface charge is summarized in table 1 as a result the detachment of gypsum nuclei or crystals from al particle surfaces to the bulk solution is less likely to occur than that with the other three types of particles this hypothesis is consistent with the results of the change in light transmittance fig s1b the light transmittance proportional to number and size of particles in the case of al particles decreases more slowly than that in the case of sl particles which may indicate that a smaller number of gypsum crystals are formed in the bulk solution in the presence of al particles compared to that in the case of sl particles wang et al 2010 the inhibition effect of colloidal particles on the observed induction time of gypsum crystallization is attributed to the interruption of the oriented aggregation of gypsum crystals fig 6c as discussed above the oriented attachment or aggregation of gypsum crystals plays an important role during the gypsum growth stage the added colloidal particles collide with gypsum crystals and interfere with the oriented aggregation of gypsum crystals by providing a steric like repulsion between them thus gypsum growth is inhibited leading to a longer induction time an inhibitory effect of added particles on crystal growth has also been reported in a previous study hao et al 2019 this inhibition mechanism induced by colloidal particles is further verified by gypsum crystallization experiments under different stirring speed conditions fig s2 with increasing stirring speed the induction time increases only slightly in the absence of colloidal particles while it increases significantly in the presence of colloidal particles we attribute the latter observation to the increased collision rate between colloidal particles and gypsum crystals at higher stirring speeds thus enhancing the disruption of added particles on the oriented attachment of gypsum crystals we note that this inhibition of gypsum crystallization is also observed with larger particles 5 μm in diameter at higher particle mass concentrations than the small size particles fig s3 based on the above discussion we conclude that the overall impact of colloidal particles on gypsum crystallization is determined by the combined enhancement effect in the nucleation step and the inhibition effect in the subsequent crystal growth step for example at a relatively high si si 6 34 the induction time is shortened since the enhancement effect in the nucleation stage is dominant fig 3a while at lower si si 5 75 or 4 92 the overall crystallization induction time is increased because the inhibition effect on crystal growth induced by colloidal particles becomes more significant 4 conclusion we performed the first comparison of the impact of natural organic matter specifically srha and colloidal particles on gypsum crystallization srha with its abundant carboxyl groups not only prolongs the observed induction time of gypsum crystallization but also changes the morphology and crystal growth orientation of the formed gypsum crystals due to the adsorption of srha molecules on the gypsum surface these results suggest that scaling control may be achieved by tailoring the molecular structure of polymeric antiscalants to achieve strong adsorption on crystalline scale surfaces in contrast colloidal particles do not change the crystal morphology but alter the observed induction time of gypsum crystallization in a more complex way the overall impact of colloidal particles on the gypsum crystallization induction time is determined by a competition between the enhancement effect during the nucleation step via heterogeneous nucleation and the inhibition effect in the subsequent crystal growth step through the disruption of oriented attachment of gypsum crystals therefore it might be necessary to consider these two opposite impacts when evaluating the performance of novel particulate antiscalants at different saturation conditions the effect of particulate antiscalants on gypsum crystallization is also related to their size distribution we note however that both natural organic matter and colloidal particles induce surface fouling in membrane desalination and other engineered systems lee et al 2005 quay et al 2018 future studies on the combined effects of fouling and scaling should be conducted to optimize the fouling and scaling control methods overall our study provides fundamental insights into the mechanisms of gypsum scale formation with different feedwaters that can lead to the development of novel antiscalants and scale

15997,sidestream partial nitritation and deammonification pn a of high strength ammonia wastewater is a well established technology its expansion to the mainstream is however mainly impeded by poor retention of anaerobic ammonia oxidizing bacteria anaob insufficient repression of nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob and difficult control of soluble chemical oxygen demand and nitrite levels at the municipal wastewater treatment plant in strass austria the microbial consortium was exhaustively monitored at full scale over one and a half year with regular transfer of sidestream demon biomass and further retention and enrichment of granular anammox biomass via hydrocyclone operation routine process parameters were surveyed and the response and evolution of the microbiota was followed by molecular tools ex situ activity tests and further anaob quantification through particle tracking and heme measurement after eight months of operation the first anaerobic simultaneous depletion of ammonia and nitrite was observed ex situ together with a direction to higher nitrite generation 68 of total nox n as compared to nitrate under aerobic conditions our dissolved oxygen do scheme allowed for transient anoxic conditions and had a strong influence on nitrite levels and the nob community where nitrobacter eventually dominated nitrospira the establishment of a minor but stable anaob biomass was accompanied by the rise of chloroflexi and distinct emergence of chlorobi a trend not seen in the sidestream system interestingly the most pronounced switch in the microbial community and noticeable nob repression occurred during unfavorable conditions i e the cold winter season and high organic load further abatement of nob was achieved through bioaugmentation of aerobic ammonia oxidizing bacteria aeraob from the sidestream demon tank performance of the sidestream pn a was not impaired by this operational scheme and the average volumetric nitrogen removal rate of the

performing mainstream treatment through high rate a stage and low rate b stage biological stages and it is designed for a population equivalent pe load of 167 000 nitrification denitrification the wwtp is located in a typical tourist region leading to sudden and significant increases in pe loads especially peaking during the winter holiday season to alleviate this problem the demon process was implemented for sidestream treatment of ammonia rich ad sludge liquor in 2004 to test the full scale approach of mainstream deammonification the plant was adapted to allow for biomass transfer between side and mainstream sludge liquor sl and biological stage b respectively see figure s1 or wett et al 2015 fig 1 demon biomass transfer to the mainstream was performed in two ways firstly semi continuously and in varying amounts in the form of mixed liquor seeding anaob and aeraom biomass with no size selection depending on biomass availability fig 1 secondly on a regular basis through the

analysis of dgge data were performed to screen for significant differences and to monitor the evolution of the microbial communities for detailed information on each specific statistical test and respective data set that was analysed please refer to the supplementary material 3 results 3 1 general evaluation of the process scheme basic data on the influent characteristics and environmental conditions are depicted in fig 1 and figure s2 daily values and table s1 and can be summarized as follows the average temperature during the sampling period was 14 1 3 1 c with a minimum value of 8 1 c and maximum of 19 c the ph was 7 31 0 31 and 7 74 0 25 in the mainstream and demon sidestream respectively mean electrical conductivity in the b stage was 0 72 0 14 ms cm 1 while it was significantly higher in the sl reactor 3 01 0 52 ms cm 1 the 1 domms measurement indicated a stronger presence of higher molecular size compounds in the sl as compared to b with values of 3 58 0 62 and 10 8 3 24 respectively influent load during the sampling campaign ranged from 17 133 to 108 400 m3 d 1 with a mean of 29 490 10 752 m3 d 1 the cod and bod5 influent loads were 15 773 4826 kg d 1 and 7930 2379 kg d 1 respectively total nitrogen concentration was 39 2 11 5 mg l 1 peaking at 69 mg l 1 fig 2 a total of 3010 m3 of sidestream biomass was bioaugmented to the mainstream in 73 events of 15 to 90 m3 per day fig 2 summarizes the b stage influent concentrations cod load cod n total n nh4 n and no3 n influent that were measured in the intermittent clarifier higher organic samplings 5 and 11 13 and nitrogen concentrations samplings 11 13 as well as a peak in nitrate at time point 9 can be seen higher total nitrogen concentrations and loads in the influent caused a response mainly in the oxidised nitrogen species with a slight temporal shift fig 3 ammonia effluent concentrations remained stable over the whole period with average values of 2 9 1 4 mg l 1 and extreme values of 0 3 and 10 6 mg l 1 this indicates that a stable nitrification performance was achieved that had to cope with sudden load pulses e g holiday season around sampling b12 nitrite levels were very low from time point b1 to b10 and showed a tenfold increase around sampling point b11 and b12 from 0 32 to 4 05 mg l 1 until they decreased around b14 and stabilized at initial values around sampling b16 finally nitrate was the most fluctuating nitrogen species reaching highest values during sampling period b8 to b10 and b12 concentrations ranged around 4 1 3 9 mg l 1 with extremes of 1 0 and 14 4 mg l 1 decrease in nitrate concentration co occurs with nitrite increase in the period between day 200 and 250 and nitrite overshoots nitrate at the point of time when the christmas load peak was received b12 nitrogen removal efficiency n re and ammonium removal efficiency nh4 n re of the mainstream averaged 84 1 11 1 and 68 6 15 1 respectively with highest values achieved at b1 and during samplings b11 b14 see supplementary table s7 the mainstream volumetric nitrogen removal rate reached 58 4 24 5 g n m 3 d 1 and biomass specific nrr 13 9 5 2 mg n g 1 tss d 1 respectively a clear increase in nrr from sampling b10 to b15 was detectable and maxima reached 104 g n m 3 d 1 at b14 and 27 5 mg n g 1 tss d 1 at b15 respectively table s7 3 2 particle tracking based on the characteristic reddish color of the anaob granules particle tracking allowed for a detailed insight into the bioaugmentation of the mainstream with demon biomass and the retention strategy through hydrocyclone operation podmirseg et al 2015 figure s3 throughout the sampling period anaob biomass was increased and successfully maintained in the mainstream the initial b1 anammox abundance in the mainstream was 0 33 0 42 particles ml 1 with a total cross section area of 0 031 0 05 mm2 ml 1 detected anammox granules could only be assigned to the smallest size categories 1 and 2 until sampling b4 a constant increase of anammox biomass area was noticed followed by a stabilization phase b5 b9 and a subsequent strong increase b10 12 until the anammox biomass reached its peak at sampling time b12 with 6 17 granules ml 1 and 3 02 mm2 ml 1 respectively here 24 of all granules could be attributed to size categories 3 5 15 2 category 3 5 29 category 4 and 3 57 category 5 the particle number peaked at sampling b13 with 23 7 granules ml 1 but due to fewer big granules only 2 77 in categories 3 5 the overall anammox biomass area dropped considerably in the end b17 15 6 9 03 granules were detected per ml and the granules cross section area ranged around 0 4 0 29 mm2 ml 1 similar to the stabilization phase b5 b9 finally 3 18 of the granules were within size categories 3 5 compared to the control sampling b1 prior to bioaugmentation anammox biomass area was increased 17 times until b17 and even 97 times at the peak b12 similarly for granule abundance a 47 fold and even 72 fold increase compared to control levels was achieved at b17 and b13 respectively the hydrocyclone clearly selected for bigger granules in the underflow as i no granules of size category 5 were detected in the b of fraction or very few at the sl stage ii the smallest size category was most abundant in the overflow fraction followed by the sample origin b or sl and eventually the underflow fraction and last iii particle concentrations were considerably higher in the underflow table s5 3 3 activity measurements ex situ anaerobic and aerobic activity measurements of the b stage were conducted to shed light onto the evolution of the potential nitrogen turnover rates the potential activity of specific groups and pathways that can occur simultaneously could be determined following the underlying principles firstly concerning anoxic incubation the potential ammonification of dissolved organic nitrogen leads to an increase nh4 n and activity of anaob to a decrease of ammonium nh4 n both anaob and denitrifier activity lower nitrite concentration no2 n and anaob activity slightly increases nitrate concentration no3 n while potential denitrifier activity leads to nitrate decrease no3 n secondly aerobic incubation permits aeraob activity with nitrite no2 n and nob activity with concomitant nitrate increase no3 n here nitrite accumulation points out imbalances in the activity of the nitrifier community measurements were carried out starting from sampling point 5 day 105 initially the anaerobic activity measurements showed concurrent nitrite and nitrate removal nox n 0 75 mg n g 1 tss h 1 and ammonium increase at low levels fig 4 left these low rates were preserved under temporary nitrite generation b8 b10 after sampling b10 the trends changed drastically towards clearly reduced ammonium generation except for b13 and even net ammonium removal at samplings b12 b14 and b15 nitrite depletion rates increased 5 to even 24 fold the average depletion rate of interval b5 b10 in general after b12 nitrite depletion was significantly higher than nitrate removal ratio on average 4 6 to 1 the highest removal rates for all nitrogen species were 0 05 mg nh4 n g 1 tss h 1 b15 3 84 mg no2 n g 1 tss h 1 b15 and 1 13 mg no3 n g 1 tss h 1 b15 the first simultaneous net ammonium and nitrite removal was detected at sampling b12 the general trends for aerobic activity measurements can also be grouped into the first six b5 b10 and the last six b12 b17 sampling points fig 4 right at the beginning full conversion of ammonium towards nitrate was observed 1 24 mg nh4 n g 1 tss h 1 to 1 43 mg no3 n g 1 tss h 1 these average ammonium oxidation rates remained relatively stable with eventual accessorily nitrite depletion however at sampling point b12 the general picture changed and nitrate generation was repressed on average for the last five sampling times b13 b17 ammonium depletion doubled a drastic increase in nitrite generation was recorded and nitrate generation was cut in half the highest removal rates for ammonium and generation of nitrite were 5 59 mg n g 1 tss h 1 b15 and 5 37 mg n g 1 tss h 1 b15 respectively and the lowest production of no3 n was encountered at sampling b16 0 6 mg n g 1 tss h 1 for the first time at sampling b12 and thereafter except for sampling b13 more ammonium was converted to nitrite compared to nitrate with average values of 68 3 16 total nox n and the highest generation of nitrite with 83 2 total nox n at b15 3 4 heme quantification an additional non molecular quantification strategy for the anaob biomass the heme measurement podmirseg et al 2015 was chosen selected samples of the b stage showed a range of 0 12 to 1 13 0 07 µmol l 1 heme with an initial small peak right after the bioaugmentation had started b2 and followed by an eventual increase at the samplings b10 and b11 figure s6 the final value b17 was comparable to that from sampling b2 heme content in sl uf averaged 42 25 µmol l 1 with lowest and highest values of 13 and 71 3 µmol l 1 respectively figure s6 due to reproducible operation conditions of the hydrocyclone the evolution of the relative heme abundance of b uf and b samples should follow a similar trend therefore and also because of b sample shortage b uf heme was compared with anaob gene abundance 16s rrna gene copy numbers figure s7 and anaob cross section area of b uf samples particle tracking fig 5 correlation analyses rendered significant coefficients of r 0 52 and r 0 77 for both pairs respectively p 0 05 see table s6 and general trends were comparable among investigated parameters with the exception of anaob gene abundance already showing one extra peak at b4 whereas in general an increase of all parameters was occurring around sampling b10 b13 further significant and positive correlation of heme could be detected for anaob area b aeraob and no2 n concentrations in the mainstream with values of 0 681 0 553 and 0 657 respectively table s6 3 5 quantification of involved nitrifiers the quantitative community dynamics of the most important groups i e anaob aeraob nob nb and ns and total bacteria are shown in fig 6 the total bacterial abundance remained stable with some minor drops during low strain phases and averaged 1 1 109 6 2 108 gene copies ml 1 in the mainstream the aeraob population exhibited a similar pattern until population constantly rose from b11 onwards and eventually reached 46 fold values of the b1 aeraob population anaob abundance initially b1 was below the detection limit of 1 2 104 gene copies ml 1 it increased thereafter with the characteristic drop during the low strain phase as described for the earlier mentioned groups from sampling b12 onwards anaob levels stabilised around 2 38 105 7 35 104 gene copies ml 1 the sl anaob values were constantly higher 7 32 106 3 10 106 gene copies ml 1 the nitrobacter population remained relatively stable over time in the mainstream and dominated the sidestream nob community with on average 7 4 fold higher gene copy values than nitrospira in the mainstream the predominance over nitrospira was persistent apart from sampling b11 and b12 where nitrospira experienced a drastic increase to values of 2 6 107 3 96 106 gene copies ml 1 b11 followed by an even more pronounced decline and stabilization at low levels from b14 onwards best evaluation of nitrifier dynamics can be achieved by pairwise comparison of the relative abundances as given in fig 7 and figure s4 the ratio between aeraob and anaob ranged between 2 3 b4 and 375 b7 with lowest values and thus highest anaob numbers for the b stage at samplings b4 2 3 b5 7 6 b12 7 8 and b15 14 3 respectively in the sidestream a clearly narrower and stable ratio of aeraob anaob with an average value of 0 7 0 7 sl1 sl17 was observed the ratio of gene copy numbers of aeraob to nob changed from an initial value of 0 6 b1 to a subsequently aeraob dominated community b2 b6 7 37 7 84 from b7 b10 again nob were dominant 0 57 0 21 thereafter the ratio increased 26 6 41 peaking at b16 with 113 1 and eventually comparable to the sidestream when looking at the nob community in more detail a general dominance of nb was detected throughout the sampling period with two exceptions namely sampling b5 nb ns of 0 93 and the sudden ns increase at the sampling b11 nb ns of 0 30 and b12 nb ns of 0 27 after sampling b12 the nb dominance was even more pronounced nb ns of 38 1 14 4 in the sidestream a constant predominance of nb was observed nb ns of 7 43 4 08 although at lower ratios as discovered in b13 b17 a more thorough discussion of obtained results is given in the supplementary material 3 6 qualitative consortium analysis in the mainstream the bacterial community was mainly composed of proteobacteria bacteroidetes actinobacteria chloroflexi saccharibacteria planctomyces firmicutes and nitrospirae in descending relative abundance fig 8 the number of these eight core phyla was only exceeded at b11 b12 and b15 17 with the emergence or strong increase of chlorobi chloroflexi synergistes and spirochaetes the sidestream exhibited a similar but more stable core population the appearance of novel phyla or rise of chloroflexi was however not observed instead a relatively higher share of saccharibacteria was noted the anaob population was clearly dominated by candidatus brocadia fulgida monitoring the evolution of key groups via dgge rendered the following main outcomes i samples of time point b1 control always grouped into a separate cluster figure s10 and figure s11 ii banding patterns for nb and aeraob were different for sidestream and mainstream samples figure s10 and figure s11 iii nb showed the highest diversity band number peaking at b13 figure s12 the supplementary material gives more details on the qualitative consortium analyses also refer to figure s8 and figure s9 3 7 community evolution over time the principal component analysis fig 9 depicted a clustering of sampling phases that was not essentially driven by ambient temperatures e g samples of warm or cold seasons did not group together but rather by the duration of the bioaugmentation campaign itself i e clusters b1 b2 b6 b7 b10 b11 b12 b13 b17 the group that is obviously located against the general trend of moving from the left to the right on axis 1 over time is sampling b7 b10 which is characterised by decreasing ambient temperatures and influent load see fig 1 the most influential microbial parameters for sample differentiation were nitrospira anaob aeraob qpcr copy numbers and anaob area this general sample evolution was also corroborated by a pca ordination on replicate samples and including only the variables ph ec 1 domms α250 α365 see figure s13 the β diversity based on sequencing data shows a similar pattern see figure s14 the control sampling prior to seeding b1 aligns on the first axis with the sidestream samples sl1 2 sl11 12 whilst the earlier samplings b3 5 and b7 10 group closely together and eventually later samplings b11 12 and b15 17 distinctively move apart on the first axis that is accounting for 72 5 of the total variance figure s14 this clustering is basically due to higher relative numbers of saccharibacteria within sidestream communities shift on axis 2 and higher α diversity along with a rising dominance of chlorobi and chloroflexi in mainstream samples at the later sampling events i e drastic shift on the first coordinate positive correlations were found for parameters anaob b uf area with no2 nb ns and heme concentration with 0 65 0 63 and 0 78 respectively table s6 furthermore aeraob was positively correlated to anaob 0 73 and negatively to nitrobacter 0 62 and no3 0 69 extended results can be found in the supplementary material in table s6 4 discussion 4 1 process changes after implementation of mainstream deammonification this full scale and long term bioaugmentation campaign of demon sidestream biomass to the mainstream combined with the testing of different do regimes i e carousel type aeration leading to a do range of 0 00 to 0 55 mg l 1 for more information on this do regimes refer to wett et al 2015 led to a clear shift from conventional nitrification to partial nitritation within approximately eight months the regular transfer of sidestream biomass did not affect the operation of the demon tank indeed values of the preceding year could even be exceeded with 96 as to 95 of mean ammonium elimination ex situ activity tests indicate that nitrate formation was inhibited under experimental conditions in addition it is noteworthy to point out the simultaneous anaerobic ammonia and nitrite depletion although concomitant ammonia removal seems to be neglectable of course ammonia and nitrite concentrations of the mainstream were not as high as in the ex situ activity measurements but elevated effluent nitrite levels after sampling b11 that prevailed until b15 indicate that nitrite shunt activities had also taken place in situ in the mainstream a recent study on a three year lasting seeding of anaob biomass towards the mainstream of a full scale wwtp in denmark without additional retention of anaob biomass in the mainstream could only attribute ca 1 contribution of anammox activity to the total nitrogen removal and no direction towards nitritation denitritation was achieved kamp et al 2019 in the study presented here and as reflected by the simultaneous depletion of nitrite and ammonia fig 4 the seeding and especially retention of anaob via hydrocyclones had a clear impact on the microbial community without negatively affecting the performance of neither mainstream nor sidestream this is especially intriguing as simultaneous depletion of both nitrogen species was observed at ambient temperatures clearly below 15 c a range generally considered unfavorable for deammonification cao et al 2017 in fact the volumetric nrr but also biomass specific nrr could even be increased throughout the monitoring campaign see table s7 4 2 microbial community dynamics the effect of sidestream bioaugmentation to the mainstream is also reflected in the microbial consortium the sampling campaign covered several seasons and in the case of the wwtp aiz also tourism affected phases under standard conditions i e conventional mainstream nitrification denitrification microbial consortia are rather expected to group according to the same operating conditions i e seasons in this study samples from the same season did not cluster together fig 9 suggesting that a more substantial change took place a study on seasonal changes in waste activated sludge of a wwtp in a temperate climate zone by johnston et al 2019 reported significant differences between the waste activated sludge was microbiota of the same seasons of two consecutive years still same seasons in that case summer were more similar to each other than to any other season combined however with a general annual drift of the was community johnston et al 2019 in our study samples from same seasons were clearly separated and apart from b7 b10 autumn a constant drift over time was noticeable that is therefore most probably attributed to the bioaugmentation according to sequencing data the most obvious change occurred around b11 b12 when considerable populations of chloroflexi and chlorobi were increased or appeared respectively see also figure s14 the group of planctomycetes showed also a higher abundance at these time points pointing at a combined enrichment of all three groups through the seeding process a trend that was perceivable for approximately eight months until the end of the monitoring campaign this trend was not observed in the sidestream and this points at the emergence of a very specialized microbial consortium adapted to anoxic conditions most probably fostered through the specific aeration regime in the mainstream and the increase of granular biomass also harbouring anoxic niches a simultaneous enrichment of anaob together with members of chloroflexi under mainstream conditions was also observed in a partial nitritation anammox experiment yang et al 2018 and close interaction of both groups is further suggested by ali et al 2020 annavajhala et al 2018 a prior lab experiment with the same demon seeding source also identified chloroflexi as important player especially in granular anammox biomass park et al 2010a this microbial group is thought to feed on cell decay of autotrophs and their filamentous cell shape is believed to facilitate the generation and or maintenance of the granular structures kragelund et al 2011 in our study a very dominant cluster of the class anaerolineae with one otu comprising even 10 5 of all reads at b15 17 was detected this group of semi syntrophic narihiro et al 2012 fermentative bacteria can be considered as core class of anaerobic digestion processes the exact role or specific conditions within the mainstream that lead to the clear emergence of this class needs to be further investigated according to xia and coworkers it is the high ability to generate type iv pili that makes anaerolineae potent candidates for cell adhesion necessary for biofilm generation and direct interspecies electron transfer diet xia et al 2016 members of the chlorobi that were detected in the mainstream from b11 onwards might have played a pivotal role in the degradation of extracellular polymeric substances eps typically present in and bonding the anammox granules wang et al 2020 these eps could act as secure carbon source for these heterotrophs and in return members of the chlorobi could help to reduce nitrate produced by anaob to nitrite thus improving overall conditions for anaob growth and metabolic activity annavajhala et al 2018 lawson et al 2017 park et al 2010b it is intriguing however that this group was hardly detectable in the sidestream 0 15 but out of the 30 chlorobi associated otus one single otu that could be phylogenetically assigned to the class of sja 28 accounted for over 20 of total reads at b15 17 the exact role of this important player within the mainstream microbiota needs to be further elucidated possibly especially mainstream conditions fostered this group but also members of the ignavibacteriacea acidobacteria synergistes or spirochaetes that were not detectable in sl eventually emerged in the b stage in contrast planctomycetes and chloroflexi were clearly present in the sl samples the group of planctomycetes was also present at a considerable abundance at b1 raising the question of an autochthonous presence of anaob in the was this finding is corroborated by the particle tracking and heme quantification that were able to detect although at very low numbers concentrations granules heme respectively in the b1 sample to our experience background heme concentrations of wwtp that are not influenced by an on site anammox process range around 0 08 µmol l 1 whereas 0 85 µmol l 1 although measured in the b uf1 and not b1 sample were detected at wwtp aiz this higher natural presence of anaob can be explained by the on site installation of the demon tank already in 2004 and partial treatment of sidestream excess sludge via the mainstream still the initial anaob population of the mainstream was negligible regarding nitrogen removal processes and a real change occurred only once the regular seeding and hydrocyclone retention was started this fact is also confirmed by the fact that b1 samples of all investigated groups aeraob anaob ns and nb form a separate cluster in the dgge analyses at the first time point 4 3 bioaugmentation effect on key players of the nitrogen cycle in the mainstream the most obvious fact was the increase in the aeraob nob ratio after b12 that further increased and remained at elevated levels until the end of the sampling campaign this ratio was then comparable with the one encountered in the sl and ratios 1 can according to our findings be considered essential for partial nitritation interestingly at the first occurrence of simultaneous ammonia and nitrite depletion activity measurement b12 fig 4 the ratio aeraob nob was only 1 1 a population shift towards aeraob was already observed earlier in the monitoring campaign around b2 b6 however at these stages not coinciding with higher nitrite levels in the mainstream the anaob abundance qpcr based was also clearly increased at these earlier stages even though such increase was accompanied by low heme concentration in b uf samples figure s7 pointing towards a still less active or less adapted anaob biomass ali et al 2013 podmirseg et al 2015 another difference between these two phases relied on high temperature and low strain phase for the earlier time points b2 b6 as compared to low temperatures and high strain phase at sampling b11 b12 possibly facilitating nitrite accumulation in the mainstream and thus deammonification ex situ activity measurements that could have further proved if an earlier direction towards nitrification occured however were only included from sampling b5 onwards the higher nitrite levels were eventually achieved through an operating mode that allowed for transient anoxic conditions along the flow path wett et al 2015 also earlier modeling approaches confirmed that a rather rapid transition between high and low do conditions instead of constant low do levels eventually leads to nob repression wett et al 2013 it can definitely be stated that the microbial group that was most affected by the operating scheme in the mainstream was the nob this effect took place at b12 and manifested itself in a drastic drop of nitrospira whereas the nitrobacter population remained stable our findings corroborate an extensive lab scale study that compared microbial communities in partial nitritation and conventional nitrification systems zhao et al 2018 also there a shift towards partial nitritation is accompanied by a dominance of nitrobacter whereas conventional operational schemes allow for an equilibrium of both genera zhao et al 2018 this shift might be explained by the physiological differences of both nobs as nitrospira exhibit high substrate affinity and slow growth rate and nitrobacter show low substrate affinity and higher growth rate park et al 2017 favouring the dominance of the latter especially at elevated nitrite concentrations i e around b12 this eventual predominance of nb was accompanied by an increase in nb diversity at stable cell numbers probably environmental conditions fostered the emergence of more adapted nitrobacter strains as opposed to sidestream systems facing high levels of free ammonia fa the range of fa within the mainstream 0 16 0 2 mg fa l 1 might not have been high enough to act as further nob suppressing factor cao et al 2017 poot et al 2016 it remains uncertain if a concomitant activity of comammox within the mainstream system took place so far this group has been linked to an oligotrophy but recent findings suggest a very high habitat versatility and non neglectable role of comammox bacteria especially at lower ammonia nitrogen and do levels annavajhala et al 2018 kits et al 2017 luo et al 2022 yung hsien and jer horng 2021 in this study 16s rrna gene analysis for comammox nitrospira related otus did not allow for phylogenetic classification down to species level thus a detection of distinct comammox bacteria was impeded but should be a focus of future studies candidatus nitrotoga a cold adapted nob of the group of betaproteobacteria that can also be enriched from activated sludge of wwtp with very similar average annual temperatures was not detected in our study alawi et al 2007 the question remains if the dominance of nitrobacter within the nob population is the key to the direction of the mainstream towards combined nob suppression and nitritation deammonification or if this was only one possible approach that was valid for our study design and further intensified through the higher nb abundance of the seeding source nevertheless and summarizing the combination of successful nob suppression and bioaugmentation of anaob aeraob from the sidestream to the mainstream raised the potential of the microbiota to increased nitrite generation of up to 86 of total nox n b16 after a time of eight months starting at ca b12 4 4 evaluation of the anaob enrichment strategy the success of the two chosen enrichment and retention strategies i e frequent transfer of excess biomass from the sidestream sl of and mainstream hydrocyclone operation could be demonstrated via all monitored parameters qpcr heme quantification particle tracking and partly via the activity measurements they all exhibited a very similar pattern corroborating a trend with peaks around b12 b14 and elevated values thereafter it would be an interesting task to compare anaob related gene expression profiles as shown previously park et al 2010b 2015 with heme concentration to see to which extent activity and not only presence is captured by this parameter although anaob granule size varied significantly it showed a constant increase of relative abundance for the mid size fractions 0 1 0 2 and 0 2 0 3 mm over time it has been stated by several authors that not the granule size but rather the total number of granules and especially the smaller granules with large surface area render the process more effective cao et al 2017 this might be due to faster proliferation larger mass transfer and general activity of suspended or free anaob biomass cao et al 2017 in contrast to this other authors stated that larger granules especially when shielded with an aeraob rim bear higher anammox activity rates than small aggregates nielsen et al 2005 vlaeminck et al 2010 due to the relatively high doubling time of approximately eleven days under ideal conditions and 25 days at temperatures below 20 c xu et al 2015 sole seeding of biomass from sidestream to mainstream does not seem to have enough impact on anaob retention comparing results of other full scale studies the implementation of the hydrocyclone or similar retention devices e g screens is regarded a prerequisite for biomass maintenance in the mainstream han et al 2016 kamp et al 2019 this might have been the right combination of anaob selecting factors that eventually led to the establishment of a distinct anaob population accompanied by an increase in the volumetric nrr even throughout the colder winter season as reflected by comparison of mean volumetric nrr values of the first phase b1 b10 42 6 13 3 g m 3 d 1 and the second phase b11 b17 81 0 17 9 g m 3 d 1 of this monitoring campaign focusing on the quantification results it seems for the system studied that anaob abundance of approximately 1 13 0 07 µmol heme l 1 or ca 105 anaob 16s rrna gene copies per ml 1 are necessary for a direction towards a noticeable deammonification activity within the mainstream equally a relative abundance of anaob of at least 0 1 of the total bacterial population was necessary to observe simultaneous ammonia and nitrite depletion and reduced nitrate generation potential 5 conclusion the initial microbial community of the mainstream responded to operational changes and displayed a noticeable switch in its functional potential as displayed via ex situ activity tests the abundance of the anaob population was eventually large enough to detect deammonification at later time points and seeding from sidestream to mainstream had a positive effect on overall nitrogen removal efficiency volumetric and biomass specific nrr experienced nearly a doubling in the mainstream pointing at a robust process performance at reduced aeration costs due to the optimized carousel type aeration regime suppression of nob was expressed by elevated nitrite concentrations and went along with simoultaneous anaob activity significant heme no2 correlation in our study ns related nob out competition was basically achieved by continued feeding of sidestream biomass enriched in aeraob and nb interestingly the repression of nob occurred under unfavorable plant operational conditions i e cold winter season and high organic load thus a combination of both the bioaugmentation strategy combined with the prevailing higher ammonia and nitrite concentrations might have further promoted this observed switch more research is needed on potential enrichment approaches of anaob biomass in the mainstream e g hydrocyclone versus screen impact on the microbiota and fine tuning of selective suppression promotion of specific microbial players combined with a monitoring of functional gene expressions patterns in addition

15997,sidestream partial nitritation and deammonification pn a of high strength ammonia wastewater is a well established technology its expansion to the mainstream is however mainly impeded by poor retention of anaerobic ammonia oxidizing bacteria anaob insufficient repression of nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob and difficult control of soluble chemical oxygen demand and nitrite levels at the municipal wastewater treatment plant in strass austria the microbial consortium was exhaustively monitored at full scale over one and a half year with regular transfer of sidestream demon biomass and further retention and enrichment of granular anammox biomass via hydrocyclone operation routine process parameters were surveyed and the response and evolution of the microbiota was followed by molecular tools ex situ activity tests and further anaob quantification through particle tracking and heme measurement after eight months of operation the first anaerobic simultaneous depletion of ammonia and nitrite was observed ex situ together with a direction to higher nitrite generation 68 of total nox n as compared to nitrate under aerobic conditions our dissolved oxygen do scheme allowed for transient anoxic conditions and had a strong influence on nitrite levels and the nob community where nitrobacter eventually dominated nitrospira the establishment of a minor but stable anaob biomass was accompanied by the rise of chloroflexi and distinct emergence of chlorobi a trend not seen in the sidestream system interestingly the most pronounced switch in the microbial community and noticeable nob repression occurred during unfavorable conditions i e the cold winter season and high organic load further abatement of nob was achieved through bioaugmentation of aerobic ammonia oxidizing bacteria aeraob from the sidestream demon tank performance of the sidestream pn a was not impaired by this operational scheme and the average volumetric nitrogen removal rate of the mainstream even doubled in the second half of the monitoring campaign we conclude that a combination of both regular sidestream demon biomass transfer and granular srt increase via hydrocyclone

a half year full scale monitoring campaign introducing the deammonification process to the mainstream of a municipal wwtp to allow for an ideal initiation of the deammonification process in the low rate biological stage b stage constant seeding of anaob and aeraom biomass from the sidestream demon i e sludge liquor sl was performed and the retention time of granular anaob biomass in the mainstream was increased by a density selecting hydrocyclone the direction towards a nitritation anammox rather than a nitrification denitrification process was further promoted through a specific aeration regime in the mainstream that is summarized together with other operational characteristics in wett et al 2015 in principle varying dissolved oxygen do levels due to intermittent aeration regime favor aeraom over nob due to their different oxygen affinities their different nitrite half saturation characteristics and temperature sensitivities enable the control of competition between nob and anaob a comprehensive microbiological monitoring campaign was undertaken collecting not only basic process data but also investigating qualitative and quantitative effects of the novel operational scheme on the microbial consortium we used quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis dgge amplicon sequencing particle tracking and a novel heme quantification kit for on site anaob abundance and activity measurement here we focused on the following points i the effect of demon biomass seeding on mainstream microbial diversity and activity ii the efficiency of this novel operational scheme to inhibit nob and thus facilitate mainstream deammonification and iii the suitability and contribution of hydrocyclone retention to maintain a constant anammox biomass in the mainstream 2 material and methods 2 1 wastewater treatment plant characteristics and operational scheme the wwtp aiz in strass austria http aiz at is a net energy positive plant performing mainstream treatment through high rate a stage and low rate b stage biological stages and it is designed for a population equivalent pe load of 167 000 nitrification denitrification the wwtp is located in a typical tourist region leading to sudden and significant increases in pe loads especially peaking during the winter holiday season to alleviate this problem the demon process was implemented for sidestream treatment of ammonia rich ad sludge liquor in 2004 to test the full scale approach of mainstream deammonification the plant was adapted to allow for biomass transfer between side and mainstream sludge liquor sl and biological stage b respectively see figure s1 or wett et al 2015 fig 1 demon biomass transfer to the mainstream was performed in two ways firstly semi continuously and in varying amounts in the form of mixed liquor seeding anaob and aeraom biomass with no size selection depending on biomass availability fig 1 secondly on a regular basis through the transfer of the overflow of low density hydrocyclone fraction usually 1 h of cyclone operation per sequencing batch reactor sbr cycle 4 sbr cycles day of the demon tank mostly aeraom anaob and little nob increase of anammox sludge retention time in the mainstream was achieved through the installation of a hydrocyclone in the return sludge line to keep the high density fraction containing anammox granules in the basin for a further optimization of the process conditions towards a nitritation and mainstream deammonification process oxygen competition aeraob and nob and nitrite competition anaob and nob were controlled details can be found in wett et al 2015 a detailed summary on influent parameters volumetric cod and biological oxygen demand bod5 loads seeding load from the side to the

analysis of dgge data were performed to screen for significant differences and to monitor the evolution of the microbial communities for detailed information on each specific statistical test and respective data set that was analysed please refer to the supplementary material 3 results 3 1 general evaluation of the process scheme basic data on the influent characteristics and environmental conditions are depicted in fig 1 and figure s2 daily values and table s1 and can be summarized as follows the average temperature during the sampling period was 14 1 3 1 c with a minimum value of 8 1 c and maximum of 19 c the ph was 7 31 0 31 and 7 74 0 25 in the mainstream and demon sidestream respectively mean electrical conductivity in the b stage was 0 72 0 14 ms cm 1 while it was significantly higher in the sl reactor 3 01 0 52 ms cm 1 the 1 domms measurement indicated a stronger presence of higher molecular size compounds in the sl as compared to b with values of 3 58 0 62 and 10 8 3 24 respectively influent load during the sampling campaign ranged from 17 133 to 108 400 m3 d 1 with a mean of 29 490 10 752 m3 d 1 the cod and bod5 influent loads were 15 773 4826 kg d 1 and 7930 2379 kg d 1 respectively total nitrogen concentration was 39 2 11 5 mg l 1 peaking at 69 mg l 1 fig 2 a total of 3010 m3 of sidestream biomass was bioaugmented to the mainstream in 73 events of 15 to 90 m3 per day fig 2 summarizes the b stage influent concentrations cod load cod n total n nh4 n and no3 n influent that were measured in the intermittent clarifier higher organic samplings 5 and 11 13 and nitrogen concentrations samplings 11 13 as well as a peak in nitrate at time point 9 can be seen higher total nitrogen concentrations and loads in the influent caused a response mainly in the oxidised nitrogen species with a slight temporal shift fig 3 ammonia effluent concentrations remained stable over the whole period with average values of 2 9 1 4 mg l 1 and extreme values of 0 3 and 10 6 mg l 1 this indicates that a stable nitrification performance was achieved that had to cope with sudden load pulses e g holiday season around sampling b12 nitrite levels were very low from time point b1 to b10 and showed a tenfold increase around sampling point b11 and b12 from 0 32 to 4 05 mg l 1 until they decreased around b14 and stabilized at initial values around sampling b16 finally nitrate was the most fluctuating nitrogen species reaching highest values during sampling period b8 to b10 and b12 concentrations ranged around 4 1 3 9 mg l 1 with extremes of 1 0 and 14 4 mg l 1 decrease in nitrate concentration co occurs with nitrite increase in the period between day 200 and 250 and nitrite overshoots nitrate at the point of time when the christmas load peak was received b12 nitrogen removal efficiency n re and ammonium removal efficiency nh4 n re of the mainstream averaged 84 1 11 1 and 68 6 15 1 respectively with highest values achieved at b1 and during samplings b11 b14 see supplementary table s7 the mainstream volumetric nitrogen removal rate reached 58 4 24 5 g n m 3 d 1 and biomass specific nrr 13 9 5 2 mg n g 1 tss d 1 respectively a clear increase in nrr from sampling b10 to b15 was detectable and maxima reached 104 g n m 3 d 1 at b14 and 27 5 mg n g 1 tss d 1 at b15 respectively table s7 3 2 particle tracking based on the characteristic reddish color of the anaob granules particle tracking allowed for a detailed insight into the bioaugmentation of the mainstream with demon biomass and the retention strategy through hydrocyclone operation podmirseg et al 2015 figure s3 throughout the sampling period anaob biomass was increased and successfully maintained in the mainstream the initial b1 anammox abundance in the mainstream was 0 33 0 42 particles ml 1 with a total cross section area of 0 031 0 05 mm2 ml 1 detected anammox granules could only be assigned to the smallest size categories 1 and 2 until sampling b4 a constant increase of anammox biomass area was noticed followed by a stabilization phase b5 b9 and a subsequent strong increase b10 12 until the anammox biomass reached its peak at sampling time b12 with 6 17 granules ml 1 and 3 02 mm2 ml 1 respectively here 24 of all granules could be attributed to size categories 3 5 15 2 category 3 5 29 category 4 and 3 57 category 5 the particle number peaked at sampling b13 with 23 7 granules ml 1 but due to fewer big granules only 2 77 in categories 3 5 the overall anammox biomass area dropped considerably in the end b17 15 6 9 03 granules were detected per ml and the granules cross section area ranged around 0 4 0 29 mm2 ml 1 similar to the stabilization phase b5 b9 finally 3 18 of the granules were within size categories 3 5 compared to the control sampling b1 prior to bioaugmentation anammox biomass area was increased 17 times until b17 and even 97 times at the peak b12 similarly for granule abundance a 47 fold and even 72 fold increase compared to control levels was achieved at b17 and b13 respectively the hydrocyclone clearly selected for bigger granules in the underflow as i no granules of size category 5 were detected in the b of fraction or very few at the sl stage ii the smallest size category was most abundant in the overflow fraction followed by the sample origin b or sl and eventually the underflow fraction and last iii particle concentrations were considerably higher in the underflow table s5 3 3 activity measurements ex situ anaerobic and aerobic activity measurements of the b stage were conducted to shed light onto the evolution of the potential nitrogen turnover rates the potential activity of specific groups and pathways that can occur simultaneously could be determined following the underlying principles firstly concerning anoxic incubation the potential ammonification of dissolved organic nitrogen leads to an increase nh4 n and activity of anaob to a decrease of ammonium nh4 n both anaob and denitrifier activity lower nitrite concentration no2 n and anaob activity slightly increases nitrate concentration no3 n while potential denitrifier activity leads to nitrate decrease no3 n secondly aerobic incubation permits aeraob activity with nitrite no2 n and nob activity with concomitant nitrate increase no3 n here nitrite accumulation points out imbalances in the activity of the nitrifier community measurements were carried out starting from sampling point 5 day 105 initially the anaerobic activity measurements showed concurrent nitrite and nitrate removal nox n 0 75 mg n g 1 tss h 1 and ammonium increase at low levels fig 4 left these low rates were preserved under temporary nitrite generation b8 b10 after sampling b10 the trends changed drastically towards clearly reduced ammonium generation except for b13 and even net ammonium removal at samplings b12 b14 and b15 nitrite depletion rates increased 5 to even 24 fold the average depletion rate of interval b5 b10 in general after b12 nitrite depletion was significantly higher than nitrate removal ratio on average 4 6 to 1 the highest removal rates for all nitrogen species were 0 05 mg nh4 n g 1 tss h 1 b15 3 84 mg no2 n g 1 tss h 1 b15 and 1 13 mg no3 n g 1 tss h 1 b15 the first simultaneous net ammonium and nitrite removal was detected at sampling b12 the general trends for aerobic activity measurements can also be grouped into the first six b5 b10 and the last six b12 b17 sampling points fig 4 right at the beginning full conversion of ammonium towards nitrate was observed 1 24 mg nh4 n g 1 tss h 1 to 1 43 mg no3 n g 1 tss h 1 these average ammonium oxidation rates remained relatively stable with eventual accessorily nitrite depletion however at sampling point b12 the general picture changed and nitrate generation was repressed on average for the last five sampling times b13 b17 ammonium depletion doubled a drastic increase in nitrite generation was recorded and nitrate generation was cut in half the highest removal rates for ammonium and generation of nitrite were 5 59 mg n g 1 tss h 1 b15 and 5 37 mg n g 1 tss h 1 b15 respectively and the lowest production of no3 n was encountered at sampling b16 0 6 mg n g 1 tss h 1 for the first time at sampling b12 and thereafter except for sampling b13 more ammonium was converted to nitrite compared to nitrate with average values of 68 3 16 total nox n and the highest generation of nitrite with 83 2 total nox n at b15 3 4 heme quantification an additional non molecular quantification strategy for the anaob biomass the heme measurement podmirseg et al 2015 was chosen selected samples of the b stage showed a range of 0 12 to 1 13 0 07 µmol l 1 heme with an initial small peak right after the bioaugmentation had started b2 and followed by an eventual increase at the samplings b10 and b11 figure s6 the final value b17 was comparable to that from sampling b2 heme content in sl uf averaged 42 25 µmol l 1 with lowest and highest values of 13 and 71 3 µmol l 1 respectively figure s6 due to reproducible operation conditions of the hydrocyclone the evolution of the relative heme abundance of b uf and b samples should follow a similar trend therefore and also because of b sample shortage b uf heme was compared with anaob gene abundance 16s rrna gene copy numbers figure s7 and anaob cross section area of b uf samples particle tracking fig 5 correlation analyses rendered significant coefficients of r 0 52 and r 0 77 for both pairs respectively p 0 05 see table s6 and general trends were comparable among investigated parameters with the exception of anaob gene abundance already showing one extra peak at b4 whereas in general an increase of all parameters was occurring around sampling b10 b13 further significant and positive correlation of heme could be detected for anaob area b aeraob and no2 n concentrations in the mainstream with values of 0 681 0 553 and 0 657 respectively table s6 3 5 quantification of involved nitrifiers the quantitative community dynamics of the most important groups i e anaob aeraob nob nb and ns and total bacteria are shown in fig 6 the total bacterial abundance remained stable with some minor drops during low strain phases and averaged 1 1 109 6 2 108 gene copies ml 1 in the mainstream the aeraob population exhibited a similar pattern until population constantly rose from b11 onwards and eventually reached 46 fold values of the b1 aeraob population anaob abundance initially b1 was below the detection limit of 1 2 104 gene copies ml 1 it increased thereafter with the characteristic drop during the low strain phase as described for the earlier mentioned groups from sampling b12 onwards anaob levels stabilised around 2 38 105 7 35 104 gene copies ml 1 the sl anaob values were constantly higher 7 32 106 3 10 106 gene copies ml 1 the nitrobacter population remained relatively stable over time in the mainstream and dominated the sidestream nob community with on average 7 4 fold higher gene copy values than nitrospira in the mainstream the predominance over nitrospira was persistent apart from sampling b11 and b12 where nitrospira experienced a drastic increase to values of 2 6 107 3 96 106 gene copies ml 1 b11 followed by an even more pronounced decline and stabilization at low levels from b14 onwards best evaluation of nitrifier dynamics can be achieved by pairwise comparison of the relative abundances as given in fig 7 and figure s4 the ratio between aeraob and anaob ranged between 2 3 b4 and 375 b7 with lowest values and thus highest anaob numbers for the b stage at samplings b4 2 3 b5 7 6 b12 7 8 and b15 14 3 respectively in the sidestream a clearly narrower and stable ratio of aeraob anaob with an average value of 0 7 0 7 sl1 sl17 was observed the ratio of gene copy numbers of aeraob to nob changed from an initial value of 0 6 b1 to a subsequently aeraob dominated community b2 b6 7 37 7 84 from b7 b10 again nob were dominant 0 57 0 21 thereafter the ratio increased 26 6 41 peaking at b16 with 113 1 and eventually comparable to the sidestream when looking at the nob community in more detail a general dominance of nb was detected throughout the sampling period with two exceptions namely sampling b5 nb ns of 0 93 and the sudden ns increase at the sampling b11 nb ns of 0 30 and b12 nb ns of 0 27 after sampling b12 the nb dominance was even more pronounced nb ns of 38 1 14 4 in the sidestream a constant predominance of nb was observed nb ns of 7 43 4 08 although at lower ratios as discovered in b13 b17 a more thorough discussion of obtained results is given in the supplementary material 3 6 qualitative consortium analysis in the mainstream the bacterial community was mainly composed of proteobacteria bacteroidetes actinobacteria chloroflexi saccharibacteria planctomyces firmicutes and nitrospirae in descending relative abundance fig 8 the number of these eight core phyla was only exceeded at b11 b12 and b15 17 with the emergence or strong increase of chlorobi chloroflexi synergistes and spirochaetes the sidestream exhibited a similar but more stable core population the appearance of novel phyla or rise of chloroflexi was however not observed instead a relatively higher share of saccharibacteria was noted the anaob population was clearly dominated by candidatus brocadia fulgida monitoring the evolution of key groups via dgge rendered the following main outcomes i samples of time point b1 control always grouped into a separate cluster figure s10 and figure s11 ii banding patterns for nb and aeraob were different for sidestream and mainstream samples figure s10 and figure s11 iii nb showed the highest diversity band number peaking at b13 figure s12 the supplementary material gives more details on the qualitative consortium analyses also refer to figure s8 and figure s9 3 7 community evolution over time the principal component analysis fig 9 depicted a clustering of sampling phases that was not essentially driven by ambient temperatures e g samples of warm or cold seasons did not group together but rather by the duration of the bioaugmentation campaign itself i e clusters b1 b2 b6 b7 b10 b11 b12 b13 b17 the group that is obviously located against the general trend of moving from the left to the right on axis 1 over time is sampling b7 b10 which is characterised by decreasing ambient temperatures and influent load see fig 1 the most influential microbial parameters for sample differentiation were nitrospira anaob aeraob qpcr copy numbers and anaob area this general sample evolution was also corroborated by a pca ordination on replicate samples and including only the variables ph ec 1 domms α250 α365 see figure s13 the β diversity based on sequencing data shows a similar pattern see figure s14 the control sampling prior to seeding b1 aligns on the first axis with the sidestream samples sl1 2 sl11 12 whilst the earlier samplings b3 5 and b7 10 group closely together and eventually later samplings b11 12 and b15 17 distinctively move apart on the first axis that is accounting for 72 5 of the total variance figure s14 this clustering is basically due to higher relative numbers of saccharibacteria within sidestream communities shift on axis 2 and higher α diversity along with a rising dominance of chlorobi and chloroflexi in mainstream samples at the later sampling events i e drastic shift on the first coordinate positive correlations were found for parameters anaob b uf area with no2 nb ns and heme concentration with 0 65 0 63 and 0 78 respectively table s6 furthermore aeraob was positively correlated to anaob 0 73 and negatively to nitrobacter 0 62 and no3 0 69 extended results can be found in the supplementary material in table s6 4 discussion 4 1 process changes after implementation of mainstream deammonification this full scale and long term bioaugmentation campaign of demon sidestream biomass to the mainstream combined with the testing of different do regimes i e carousel type aeration leading to a do range of 0 00 to 0 55 mg l 1 for more information on this do regimes refer to wett et al 2015 led to a clear shift from conventional nitrification to partial nitritation within approximately eight months the regular transfer of sidestream biomass did not affect the operation of the demon tank indeed values of the preceding year could even be exceeded with 96 as to 95 of mean ammonium elimination ex situ activity tests indicate that nitrate formation was inhibited under experimental conditions in addition it is noteworthy to point out the simultaneous anaerobic ammonia and nitrite depletion although concomitant ammonia removal seems to be neglectable of course ammonia and nitrite concentrations of the mainstream were not as high as in the ex situ activity measurements but elevated effluent nitrite levels after sampling b11 that prevailed until b15 indicate that nitrite shunt activities had also taken place in situ in the mainstream a recent study on a three year lasting seeding of anaob biomass towards the mainstream of a full scale wwtp in denmark without additional retention of anaob biomass in the mainstream could only attribute ca 1 contribution of anammox activity to the total nitrogen removal and no direction towards nitritation denitritation was achieved kamp et al 2019 in the study presented here and as reflected by the simultaneous depletion of nitrite and ammonia fig 4 the seeding and especially retention of anaob via hydrocyclones had a clear impact on the microbial community without negatively affecting the performance of neither mainstream nor sidestream this is especially intriguing as simultaneous depletion of both nitrogen species was observed at ambient temperatures clearly below 15 c a range generally considered unfavorable for deammonification cao et al 2017 in fact the volumetric nrr but also biomass specific nrr could even be increased throughout the monitoring campaign see table s7 4 2 microbial community dynamics the effect of sidestream bioaugmentation to the mainstream is also reflected in the microbial consortium the sampling campaign covered several seasons and in the case of the wwtp aiz also tourism affected phases under standard conditions i e conventional mainstream nitrification denitrification microbial consortia are rather expected to group according to the same operating conditions i e seasons in this study samples from the same season did not cluster together fig 9 suggesting that a more substantial change took place a study on seasonal changes in waste activated sludge of a wwtp in a temperate climate zone by johnston et al 2019 reported significant differences between the waste activated sludge was microbiota of the same seasons of two consecutive years still same seasons in that case summer were more similar to each other than to any other season combined however with a general annual drift of the was community johnston et al 2019 in our study samples from same seasons were clearly separated and apart from b7 b10 autumn a constant drift over time was noticeable that is therefore most probably attributed to the bioaugmentation according to sequencing data the most obvious change occurred around b11 b12 when considerable populations of chloroflexi and chlorobi were increased or appeared respectively see also figure s14 the group of planctomycetes showed also a higher abundance at these time points pointing at a combined enrichment of all three groups through the seeding process a trend that was perceivable for approximately eight months until the end of the monitoring campaign this trend was not observed in the sidestream and this points at the emergence of a very specialized microbial consortium adapted to anoxic conditions most probably fostered through the specific aeration regime in the mainstream and the increase of granular biomass also harbouring anoxic niches a simultaneous enrichment of anaob together with members of chloroflexi under mainstream conditions was also observed in a partial nitritation anammox experiment yang et al 2018 and close interaction of both groups is further suggested by ali et al 2020 annavajhala et al 2018 a prior lab experiment with the same demon seeding source also identified chloroflexi as important player especially in granular anammox biomass park et al 2010a this microbial group is thought to feed on cell decay of autotrophs and their filamentous cell shape is believed to facilitate the generation and or maintenance of the granular structures kragelund et al 2011 in our study a very dominant cluster of the class anaerolineae with one otu comprising even 10 5 of all reads at b15 17 was detected this group of semi syntrophic narihiro et al 2012 fermentative bacteria can be considered as core class of anaerobic digestion processes the exact role or specific conditions within the mainstream that lead to the clear emergence of this class needs to be further investigated according to xia and coworkers it is the high ability to generate type iv pili that makes anaerolineae potent candidates for cell adhesion necessary for biofilm generation and direct interspecies electron transfer diet xia et al 2016 members of the chlorobi that were detected in the mainstream from b11 onwards might have played a pivotal role in the degradation of extracellular polymeric substances eps typically present in and bonding the anammox granules wang et al 2020 these eps could act as secure carbon source for these heterotrophs and in return members of the chlorobi could help to reduce nitrate produced by anaob to nitrite thus improving overall conditions for anaob growth and metabolic activity annavajhala et al 2018 lawson et al 2017 park et al 2010b it is intriguing however that this group was hardly detectable in the sidestream 0 15 but out of the 30 chlorobi associated otus one single otu that could be phylogenetically assigned to the class of sja 28 accounted for over 20 of total reads at b15 17 the exact role of this important player within the mainstream microbiota needs to be further elucidated possibly especially mainstream conditions fostered this group but also members of the ignavibacteriacea acidobacteria synergistes or spirochaetes that were not detectable in sl eventually emerged in the b stage in contrast planctomycetes and chloroflexi were clearly present in the sl samples the group of planctomycetes was also present at a considerable abundance at b1 raising the question of an autochthonous presence of anaob in the was this finding is corroborated by the particle tracking and heme quantification that were able to detect although at very low numbers concentrations granules heme respectively in the b1 sample to our experience background heme concentrations of wwtp that are not influenced by an on site anammox process range around 0 08 µmol l 1 whereas 0 85 µmol l 1 although measured in the b uf1 and not b1 sample were detected at wwtp aiz this higher natural presence of anaob can be explained by the on site installation of the demon tank already in 2004 and partial treatment of sidestream excess sludge via the mainstream still the initial anaob population of the mainstream was negligible regarding nitrogen removal processes and a real change occurred only once the regular seeding and hydrocyclone retention was started this fact is also confirmed by the fact that b1 samples of all investigated groups aeraob anaob ns and nb form a separate cluster in the dgge analyses at the first time point 4 3 bioaugmentation effect on key players of the nitrogen cycle in the mainstream the most obvious fact was the increase in the aeraob nob ratio after b12 that further increased and remained at elevated levels until the end of the sampling campaign this ratio was then comparable with the one encountered in the sl and ratios 1 can according to our findings be considered essential for partial nitritation interestingly at the first occurrence of simultaneous ammonia and nitrite depletion activity measurement b12 fig 4 the ratio aeraob nob was only 1 1 a population shift towards aeraob was already observed earlier in the monitoring campaign around b2 b6 however at these stages not coinciding with higher nitrite levels in the mainstream the anaob abundance qpcr based was also clearly increased at these earlier stages even though such increase was accompanied by low heme concentration in b uf samples figure s7 pointing towards a still less active or less adapted anaob biomass ali et al 2013 podmirseg et al 2015 another difference between these two phases relied on high temperature and low strain phase for the earlier time points b2 b6 as compared to low temperatures and high strain phase at sampling b11 b12 possibly facilitating nitrite accumulation in the mainstream and thus deammonification ex situ activity measurements that could have further proved if an earlier direction towards nitrification occured however were only included from sampling b5 onwards the higher nitrite levels were eventually achieved through an operating mode that allowed for transient anoxic conditions along the flow path wett et al 2015 also earlier modeling approaches confirmed that a rather rapid transition between high and low do conditions instead of constant low do levels eventually leads to nob repression wett et al 2013 it can definitely be stated that the microbial group that was most affected by the operating scheme in the mainstream was the nob this effect took place at b12 and manifested itself in a drastic drop of nitrospira whereas the nitrobacter population remained stable our findings corroborate an extensive lab scale study that compared microbial communities in partial nitritation and conventional nitrification systems zhao et al 2018 also there a shift towards partial nitritation is accompanied by a dominance of nitrobacter whereas conventional operational schemes allow for an equilibrium of both genera zhao et al 2018 this shift might be explained by the physiological differences of both nobs as nitrospira exhibit high substrate affinity and slow growth rate and nitrobacter show low substrate affinity and higher growth rate park et al 2017 favouring the dominance of the latter especially at elevated nitrite concentrations i e around b12 this eventual predominance of nb was accompanied by an increase in nb diversity at stable cell numbers probably environmental conditions fostered the emergence of more adapted nitrobacter strains as opposed to sidestream systems facing high levels of free ammonia fa the range of fa within the mainstream 0 16 0 2 mg fa l 1 might not have been high enough to act as further nob suppressing factor cao et al 2017 poot et al 2016 it remains uncertain if a concomitant activity of comammox within the mainstream system took place so far this group has been linked to an oligotrophy but recent findings suggest a very high habitat versatility and non neglectable role of comammox bacteria especially at lower ammonia nitrogen and do levels annavajhala et al 2018 kits et al 2017 luo et al 2022 yung hsien and jer horng 2021 in this study 16s rrna gene analysis for comammox nitrospira related otus did not allow for phylogenetic classification down to species level thus a detection of distinct comammox bacteria was impeded but should be a focus of future studies candidatus nitrotoga a cold adapted nob of the group of betaproteobacteria that can also be enriched from activated sludge of wwtp with very similar average annual temperatures was not detected in our study alawi et al 2007 the question remains if the dominance of nitrobacter within the nob population is the key to the direction of the mainstream towards combined nob suppression and nitritation deammonification or if this was only one possible approach that was valid for our study design and further intensified through the higher nb abundance of the seeding source nevertheless and summarizing the combination of successful nob suppression and bioaugmentation of anaob aeraob from the sidestream to the mainstream raised the potential of the microbiota to increased nitrite generation of up to 86 of total nox n b16 after a time of eight months starting at ca b12 4 4 evaluation of the anaob enrichment strategy the success of the two chosen enrichment and retention strategies i e frequent transfer of excess biomass from the sidestream sl of and mainstream hydrocyclone operation could be demonstrated via all monitored parameters qpcr heme quantification particle tracking and partly via the activity measurements they all exhibited a very similar pattern corroborating a trend with peaks around b12 b14 and elevated values thereafter it would be an interesting task to compare anaob related gene expression profiles as shown previously park et al 2010b 2015 with heme concentration to see to which extent activity and not only presence is captured by this parameter although anaob granule size varied significantly it showed a constant increase of relative abundance for the mid size fractions 0 1 0 2 and 0 2 0 3 mm over time it has been stated by several authors that not the granule size but rather the total number of granules and especially the smaller granules with large surface area render the process more effective cao et al 2017 this might be due to faster proliferation larger mass transfer and general activity of suspended or free anaob biomass cao et al 2017 in contrast to this other authors stated that larger granules especially when shielded with an aeraob rim bear higher anammox activity rates than small aggregates nielsen et al 2005 vlaeminck et al 2010 due to the relatively high doubling time of approximately eleven days under ideal conditions and 25 days at temperatures below 20 c xu et al 2015 sole seeding of biomass from sidestream to mainstream does not seem to have enough impact on anaob retention comparing results of other full scale studies the implementation of the hydrocyclone or similar retention devices e g screens is regarded a prerequisite for biomass maintenance in the mainstream han et al 2016 kamp et al 2019 this might have been the right combination of anaob selecting factors that eventually led to the establishment of a distinct anaob population accompanied by an increase in the volumetric nrr even throughout the colder winter season as reflected by comparison of mean volumetric nrr values of the first phase b1 b10 42 6 13 3 g m 3 d 1 and the second phase b11 b17 81 0 17 9 g m 3 d 1 of this monitoring campaign focusing on the quantification results it seems for the system studied that anaob abundance of approximately 1 13 0 07 µmol heme l 1 or ca 105 anaob 16s rrna gene copies per ml 1 are necessary for a direction towards a noticeable deammonification activity within the mainstream equally a relative abundance of anaob of at least 0 1 of the total bacterial population was necessary to observe simultaneous ammonia and nitrite depletion and reduced nitrate generation potential 5 conclusion the initial microbial community of the mainstream responded to operational changes and displayed a noticeable switch in its functional potential as displayed via ex situ activity tests the abundance of the anaob population was eventually large enough to detect deammonification at later time points and seeding from sidestream to mainstream had a positive effect on overall nitrogen removal efficiency volumetric and biomass specific nrr experienced nearly a doubling in the mainstream pointing at a robust process performance at reduced aeration costs due to the optimized carousel type aeration regime suppression of nob was expressed by elevated nitrite concentrations and went along with simoultaneous anaob activity significant heme no2 correlation in our study ns related nob out competition was basically achieved by continued feeding of sidestream biomass enriched in aeraob and nb interestingly the repression of nob occurred under unfavorable plant operational conditions i e cold winter season and high organic load thus a combination of both the bioaugmentation strategy combined with the prevailing higher ammonia and nitrite concentrations might have further promoted this observed switch more research is needed on potential enrichment approaches of anaob biomass in the mainstream e g hydrocyclone versus screen impact on the microbiota and fine tuning of selective suppression promotion of specific microbial players combined with a monitoring of functional gene expressions patterns in addition the role of comammox within these settings needs further elucidation author contribution statement the study design was developed by bw mh aiz wwtp smp mgb and hi sampling performed by smp mgb mm and

15998,mineralization coupled with neutralization is a dual function technology for disposing acidic iron rich waters which can recover the valuable iron in the form of secondary mineral and concurrently purify the wastewater in this study a modified technology for treating high fe wastewater sulfur acid spent pickling liquor 62 g fe l was proposed based on the specific investigation of the mineralization behaviors in fe concentration range of 20 70 g l results showed that high so4 2 fe2 molar ratio 2 0 tended to trigger gelation phenomena at fe concentrations above 30 g l fe specie distribution suggested that the insufficient polymerization among fe oh complexes might be responsible for the gelation phenomena since the strong fe so4 coordination almost completely suppressed the fex oh y 3x y form a general terms of fe3 hydrolysates and their polymers modified mineralization strategies were proposed including pretreatment with dilution or bacl2 cacl2 precipitation of which cacl2 pretreatment was a versatile and low cost method following cacl2 pretreatment chemical mineralization converted above 90 of iron into secondary mineral which therefore drastically reduced the alkali consumption from 164 2 g l to 1 4 g l and sludge yield from 328 1 g l to 2 4 g l in subsequent neutralization treatment the resultant mineral was identified as schwertmannite and exhibited efficient adsorption capacity toward arsenite 364 2 mg g the modified chemical mineralization alkaline neutralization is a cost effective technology for the treatment of the acidic iron rich waters in practical applications several regulating strategies should be further explored to improve the mineral purity and the mineralization conditions must be optimized according to the fe and so4 2 concentrations in wastewater graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords chemical mineralization strongly acidic wastewater alkali neutralization secondary iron mineral arsenite adsorption 1 introduction acidic iron rich waters are the by products of a variety of industrial operations such as mining and stainless steel processing they are generally characterized by extremely low ph elevated concentrations of metals fe al mn and possibly other toxic heavy metals such as cr cu pb ni etc johnson and hallberg 2005 regel rosocka 2010 the acidic water has become a serious global issue owing to its hazardous impact on ecological environment and human health mineralization coupled with neutralization is an alternative technology with low economic cost and high social benefit to dispose such wastewater jin et al 2020 wang et al 2019b wang et al 2021b acid mine drainage amd is a typical acidic water rich in iron and sulfate which is produced by the biological and abiotic oxidation of iron pyrite mineral park et al 2019 for the treatment of amd mineralization neutralization strategy achieves dual goals of resource recovery and wastewater purification wang et al 2019b wang et al 2021b 1 mineralization procedure effectively converts more than 90 of iron and about 50 of sulfate into iron oxy hydroxysulfate minerals mainly jarosite or schwertmannite which are valuable functional materials and possess wide applications in the field of environmental remediation 2 neutralization treatment eliminates the residual metal ions and neutralizes the acidity of solution which only requires a small amount of alkali the neutralization efficiency is closely associated with the removal efficiency of iron ion during mineralization process wang et al 2021b therefore mineralization is the core process determining the environmental value of the secondary mineral and the treatment cost of the mineralization neutralization technology mineralization process can be triggered by biological or chemical procedures the former is mainly mediated by fe2 oxidizing bacteria jin et al 2020 wang et al 2019a wang et al 2021b while the latter usually involves a hydrogen peroxide h2o2 driven reaction wang et al 2019b compared with biological strategy chemical mineralization requires less reaction time to achieve a more than 90 removal efficiency of iron chemical mineralization is initiated by h2o2 which involved two reactions 1 fe2 is oxidized into fe3 and 2 fe3 hydrolyzes and precipitates with so4 2 to form a secondary mineral zhang et al 2018 the type of resulting iron mineral can be regulated by altering the reaction environment such as solution ph and the concentration of monovalent cation bai et al 2012 generally schwertmannite is an optimal mineral specie because it has a wide prospect of applications in environmental fields as heterogeneous fenton catalyst adsorbent and soil remediation agent li et al 2021 meng et al 2021 wang et al 2021a yang et al 2017 in addition the morphology and properties of schwertmannite can be further optimized by altering the supply rate of h2o2 for example a slow addition mode facilitates the formation of a mineral with smaller size and higher specific surface area zhang et al 2019 mineralization neutralization has been proved to be a novel technology to remediate amd and its application in other acidic wastewater treatment is worthy of further exploration spent pickling liquor is a kind of strongly acidic wastewater which contains much higher acidity and metal concentrations than amd spent pickling liquor is generally produced in the steel processing industry where the pickling step is indispensable to obtain a high quality steel surface for further processing agrawal and sahu 2009 sulfur acid and hydrochloric acid are usually used to remove oxides on the surface of metal and the acid solution is considered spent when its concentration decreases by 75 85 regel rosocka 2010 the iron concentration in a typical spent pickling liquor reaches 80 250 g l accompanied by an acid concentration of 30 200 g l regel rosocka 2010 yang et al 2019 spent pickling liquor is considered hazardous waste according to both european union eu and environmental protection agency epa legislation jarosz krzemińska et al 2015 from the viewpoint of environment protection and economic benefit recovery of valuable resources is necessary and vital for the treatment of spent pickling liquor a number of technologies have been reported to recover the acid or metal ions including membrane separation pyrometallurgy evaporation precipitation neutralization ion exchange and crystallization regel rosocka 2010 several studies also attempted to utilize the spent pickling liquor as iron precursor to synthesize iron based materials i e composite polymeric ferric aluminum sulfate chloride coagulant magnetic biochar and a series of modified nanoscale zero valent irons which were further applied in environmental wastewater and soil remediation fang et al 2010 lian et al 2019 wang et al 2014 yang et al 2019 yi et al 2019 considering that iron is the main metal ion in spent pickling liquor mineralization neutralization technology may be feasible for metal recovery and wastewater purification the sulfur acid spent pickling liquor is used to investigate the mineralization neutralization technology in this study which is based on the following two considerations 1 sulfur acid is commonly used for pickling and is more difficult to be recovered than hydrochloric acid regel rosocka 2010 2 sulfate ion is requisite to form schwertmannnite during mineralization process zhang et al 2018 therefore the objectives of this study were to 1 investigate the mineralization behaviors in the acidic solution containing high concentrations of fe2 and so4 2 2 explore appropriate pretreatment methods to satisfy the mineralization demand in sulfur acid pickling waste liquor 3 evaluate the environmental application of the resultant secondary iron mineral as an adsorbent and 4 analyze the economic benefit of the modified mineralization neutralization technology the outcomes of this study would expand the application of mineralization technology in acidic fe and so4 2 rich wastewater and provide a near zero discharge technology for the treatment of the spent pickling

procedures the ph of the fe2 containing solution was firstly adjusted to 2 5 a certain volume of h2o2 molar ratio of h2o2 fe2 was 0 8 was added to the above solution in a slow addition mode divide h2o2 into six equal volumes and add one portion every 30 min the mixture solution was shaken at 180 rpm for 24 h 25 c throughout the reaction the solution ph was maintained at 2 5 by adjusting with 0 1 m h2so4 or naoh pure feso4 solution was used to investigate the mineralization conditions at high concentrations of fe 20 70 g l to test the effect of so4 2 concentration on mineralization efficiency nh4 2so4 was added to feso4 solution to obtain a so4 2 fe2 molar ratio range of 1 0 4 0 the concentrations of fe2 and fe3 were measured at predetermined time intervals and the mineralization phenomenon was directly observed by naked eyes 2 3 treatment of spent pickling liquor with modified mineralization neutralization method based on the mineralization behaviors at high fe concentrations the sulfuric acid spent pickling liquor was firstly subjected to pretreatment via two methods 1 diluted with deionized water and 2 precipitated with bacl2 or cacl2 for dilution

were set at 80 120 160 200 and 320 g l and cacl2 were 40 80 120 and 160 g l respectively after adding bacl2 or cacl2 to the pickling liquor the mixture was shaken at 180 rpm for 1 h and then centrifuged at 6000 g for 10 min to separate the precipitate a volume of 5 ml solution was withdrawn from the supernatant and filtered through a 0 45 µm membrane to analyze the water quality parameters the precipitate formed during pretreatment process was rinsed three times with deionized water and collected after vacuum dried at 60 c for 24 h the supernatant was further subjected to chemical mineralization treatment prior to mineralization treatment solution ph was firstly adjusted to 2 5 with 1 0 m and 0 1 m naoh a certain volume of h2o2 h2o2 fe2 molar ratio at 0 8 was slowly added to the pickling liquor 200 ml in six batches every 30 min the mixture was shaken at 180 rpm for 24 h and the solution ph was maintained at 2 5 during the entire reaction process after that the resultant mineral was separated with a filter paper respectively rinsed three times with dilute h2so4 solution ph 2 0 and deionized water and completely dried at 60 c for 24 h the concentrations of residual metal ions in supernatant were assayed after filtration through a 0 45 µm membrane the weight of secondary mineral and the consumption of alkali were recorded in each treatment after chemical mineralization treatment 100 ml of supernatant was withdrawn and subjected to alkali neutralization test a naoh solution 1 0 m was added dropwise to adjust solution ph to about 7 5 in addition the raw pickling liquor was also tested as a control the resultant neutralized sludge was filtered and rinsed with deionized water the consumption of alkali was recorded and the yield of dried sludge was weighed the water quality parameters of the effluent were analyzed after filtration through a 0 45 µm membrane 2 4 adsorption tests the adsorption abilities of the secondary minerals toward as iii

schwertmannite synthesized from feso4 h2o2 system sch ck initial fe2 concentration was 62 g l adsorption was conducted by adding 0 01 g mineral to 40 ml as iii containing solution with concentration range of 10 400 mg l the mixture was shaken for 24 h in a reciprocating shaker at 180 rpm 25 c solution ph was controlled at 7 0 during the entire reaction process after 24 h the solution was filtered through a 0 45 µm membrane to determine the residual as iii concentration two adsorption isotherms langmuir and freundlich models were used to fit the adsorption data and calculate the maximum

model output 3 results and discussion 3 1 mineralization behaviors at high fe concentrations 3 1 1 effect of so4 2 fe2 molar ratio on chemical mineralization a series of mineralization experiments were conducted in different initial fe2 solutions with varying molar ratios of so4 2 fe2 the presence of nh4 ion originated from nh4 2so4 would not affect the formation process of schwertmannite mineral bai et al 2012 results showed that the initial fe2 concentration and so4 2 fe2 molar ratio greatly influenced the mineralization behaviors under the current experimental condition solution ph was maintained at 2 5 and h2o2 was slowly added in six batches at high fe2 concentrations 30 g l secondary precipitates were finally generated in the solutions with low so4 2 fe2 molar ratios whereas the reaction solutions with high so4 2 fe2 ratios appeared gelation phenomena fig 1 as for gelation of solution initial fe concentration was 50 g l the reaction mixture became sticky at 3 h and turned into a viscous gel at 4 h fig s2 the viscous solution inhibited the formation of secondary iron mineral in addition the gelation phenomena were more likely to occur at higher fe2 concentration even though the molar ratio of so4 2 fe2 was slightly lower for example gelation began to appear at so4 2 fe2 ratio of 2 0 in 50 g l of fe2 solution whereas the ratio of 1 5 could induce gelation at fe2 concentration of 60 g l fig s3 from these results we concluded that the molar ratio of so4 2 fe directly influenced the mineralization behaviors in the solutions with high iron concentrations 30 g l and the threshold value corresponding to the lowest so4 2 fe ratio for gelation formation gradually decreased as the iron concentration elevated in addition the supply speed of h2o2 also had a significant influence on the gelation formation when h2o2 was quickly poured into feso4 solution so4 2 fe2 ratio was 1 0 with concentration higher than 50 g fe l the reaction solution started to gelate at 4 h fig s4 the supply speed of h2o2 was directly related to the oxidation conversion of fe2 to fe3 zhang et al 2019 a rapid addition of h2o2 would induce a large amount of fe3 ion to accumulate in solution according to the formation mechanism of secondary minerals we inferred that the enrichment of fe3 ions might be responsible for the gelation formation 3 1 2 mechanism involved in gelation phenomena chemical mineralization in feso4 solution mainly involves two reactions 1 the oxidation of fe2 and 2 the hydrolysis and precipitation of fe3 schoepfer and burton 2021 in feso4 h2o2 system at ph 2 5 schwertmannite is the predominant mineral phase instead of the other secondary iron minerals such as jarosite and ferrihydrite caraballo et al 2013 schwertmannite is a structurally distorted akaganéite and double chains of edge sharing feo6 octahedra form tunnel structure 0 5 nm where sulfate ions are presumably located majzlan and myneni 2005 wang et al 2015 in solution with ph 1 0 fe3 ion tends to hydrolyze into fe oh 2 or fe oh 2 forms flynn jr 1984 the resultant hydrolysates transform into hydroxo complexes and then polymerize into polynuclear complexes such as fe2 oh 3 3 or fe3 oh 2 7 zhang et al 2018 the akaganéite structure was the energetically preferred coordination form after a series of olation and oxolation reactions regenspurg et al 2004 sulfate further shares o ions with the feo6 octahedra by specific interactions which thus resulting in the distorted akaganéite structure of schwertmannite blgham et al 1990 regenspurg et al 2004 in general the fe3 hydrolysates and their polymers collectively referred to fex oh y 3x y species were the precursors of feo6 octahedra and their percentages directly determined the formation efficiency of schwertmannite feng et al 2021 to elaborate the mineralization behaviors at high fe concentrations fe3 species plotted with solution ph was calculated under different initial concentrations and so4 2 fe3 molar ratios fig 2 obviously various fe species coexisted in solution including fe3 feso4 fe so4 2 and fex oh y 3x y at ph below 2 5 most of dissolved fe3 coordinated with so4 2 at high fe3 concentration 20 g l feso4 was the main specie at ph lower than 3 0 whereas the percentage of fe so4 2 significantly exceeded feso4 when threefold so4 2 existed in solution fig 2a these results indicated that the coordination between fe3 and so4 2 was very strong therefore oh needed to compete with sulfate for coordination sites to form fe3 hydroxy polymers and subsequent fe3 hydroxides as shown in fig 2 the initial fe3 concentration and so4 2 fe3 ratio had significant influences on the distribution percentage of fex oh y 3x y form specifically as the molar ratio of so4 2 fe3 increased from 1 1 to 3 1 fex oh y 3x y specie was completely inhibited at ph 3 5 in 20 g l of fe3 solution fig 2a whereas its percentage was slightly decreased in dilute fe3 solution 2 g l fig 2b in other words the presence of the abundant fe so4 complexes greatly inhibited the polymerization reactions of fe3 hydrolysates finally viscous gel was formed in such solution due to the lack of adequate ostwald ripening reactions however the increase of so4 2 fe3 ratio did not dramatically inhibit the fex oh y 3x y specie in dilute fe3 solution 2 0 g l fig 2b therefore secondary iron minerals could be successfully formed after chemical mineralization reactions in general since fe3 tended to coordinate with so4 2 ion in high fe and so4 2 solution the insufficient polymerization reaction among fe oh complexes might be the main reason responsible for the gelation phenomena 3 2 modified mineralization neutralization method for the treatment of sulfur acid spent pickling liquor 3 2 1 chemical mineralization following dilution or precipitation pretreatment for chemical mineralization in high fe solution dilution is a feasible method to expand the workable so4 2 fe2 ratio by reducing the initial fe2 concentration the raw spent pickling liquor was subjected to 2 3 6 and 10 fold dilution respectively and then conducted with chemical mineralization treatments as shown in fig 3 a the conversion efficiency of fe2 was very high and fe2 was completely oxidized to fe3 within 2 h in the raw water and 2 fold dilution sets fe concentration could not be detected after 2 h due to the formation of viscous solutions gelation phenomenon occurred in the raw spent pickling liquor when direct mineralization was conducted by adding slowly h2o2 and maintaining ph at 2 5 fig s5 the mineralization behaviors in feso4 nh4 2so4 solution fig 1 clearly demonstrated that the initial fe2 concentration must be lower than 30 g l to be effectively mineralized in a solution with so4 2 fe2 ratio of 2 3 the value in pickling liquor therefore the raw spent pickling liquor should be diluted at least 3 times fig 3b further presented the corresponding fe precipitation efficiency obviously maintaining solution ph at 2 5 greatly improved the mineralization efficiency 82 at 6 h compared with the mineralization process without ph adjustment about 30 wang et al 2019b the mineralization efficiencies in 6 times and 10 times diluted wastewaters were significantly higher than that of 3 fold dilution indicating that a higher dilution factor was more conducive to chemical mineralization these results clearly showed that the mineralization efficiency after dilution pretreatment was greatly affected by the dilution factor which was directly determined by the concentrations of fe2 and so4 2 in the raw pickling liquor although dilution pretreatment was a simple and low cost method to meet the demand of chemical mineralization it inevitably multiplied the processing volume for further mineralization process therefore dilution pretreatment was not recommended as a versatile pretreatment method prior to chemical mineralization based on the mineralization behaviors at different fe concentrations fig 1a another alternative method is to directly reduce the concentration of so4 2 in the spent pickling liquor which can be realized by precipitating so4 2 with bacl2 ba2 so4 2 baso4 or cacl2 ca2 so4 2 caso4 the solubility product constant k sp of baso4 precipitate is much lower than that of caso4 1 1 10 10 vs 6 1 10 5 at 25 c rumble 2021 indicating that ba2 is more likely to precipitate with so4 2 ion however fig 4 clearly showed that a lower dose of cacl2 80 g l was sufficient to achieve the mineralization requirement whereas at least 120 g l of bacl2 was necessary for obtaining the similar result the higher precipitation efficiency of cacl2 over the equal dosed bacl2 was attributed to its lower molecular weight therefore more so4 2 was precipitated by a larger molar concentration of ca2 ion the so4 2 fe2 ratio decreased from 2 3 to 2 0 1 2 1 0 and 0 9 respectively by adding 80 320 g l of bacl2 fig 4a whereas a dose of 40 160 g l of cacl2 reduced the ratio to 2 0 1 4 1 3 and 1 0 respectively fig 4b as expected gelation phenomena appeared after reaction for 4 h in the sets of so4 2 fe2 ratio higher than 2 0 raw water 80 g l bacl2 and 40 g l cacl2 in other sets ochreous precipitates finally formed after 24 h almost 100 of fe and approximate 50 of so4 2 were removed from the pickling liquor in the form of secondary mineral fig 4 for chemical mineralization in this pickling wastewater at least 120 g l bacl2 or 80 g l cacl2 was required to reduce the so4 2 concentration considering the precipitation efficiency and reagent price cacl2 was more suitable as the pretreatment reagent than bacl2 3 2 2 promoting effect on subsequent alkali neutralization alkali was aimed to neutralize solution acidity and precipitate the residual metal ions devi et al 2014 compared with lime sodium hydroxide has a higher neutralization efficiency because the precipitation reaction between ca2 and so4 2 so4 2 ca2 caso4 will greatly increase the lime consumption johnson and hallberg 2005 after the raw pickling waste liquor was directly neutralized to ph 7 5 fe concentration decreased from 62 47 to 3 34 g l and so4 2 reduced from 243 1 to 162 2 g l table 1 the concentrations of the other metal ions greatly reduced below 0 01 g l except for mn 1 68 g l and ni 0 12 g l it was because mn2 precipitated as mn oh 2 at solution ph above about 8 5 corresponding to its solubility product constant k sp of 2 06 10 13 tang et al 2015 the amount of alkali required for direct neutralization was as high as 164 2 g l and 328 1 g l of neutralized sludge was generated after neutralization treatment table 2 compared with direct neutralization the neutralization efficiency was greatly improved after chemical mineralization treatments the concentrations of metal ions after mineralization treatments were very low table 1 mineralization following bacl2 or cacl2 pretreatments reduced the fe concentration from 62 5 g l to less than 0 5 g l whereas the residual fe after dilution pretreatment was slightly higher 1 0 g l table 1 in addition more than half of the so4 2 were removed from the pickling liquor and the cr ni mn cu and si concentrations were also drastically reduced after mineralization neutralization treatment the concentrations of ni and mn were slightly lower than those in direct neutralization table 1 to neutralize the effluents after mineralization treatments only 1 4 1 6 g l of alkali was consumed in bacl2 or cacl2 pretreatment sets whereas a weight of 32 3 g l was required in dilution pretreatment set table 2 the amounts of neutralized sludges were 2 4 10 9 g l which were drastically lower than that produced by direct neutralization 328 1 g l table 2 the neutralized sludges contained high contents of fe 67 mg g cr 38 mg g ni 40 mg g mn 8 3 mg g and cu 0 5 mg g table 2 the neutralized sludges were listed as hazardous wastes hw17 surface processing waste according to the national hazardous waste directory 2021 edition issued by the ministry of ecology and environment of the people s republic of china therefore the mineralization neutralization treatment would greatly reduce the subsequent disposal costs toward the hazardous wastes 3 2 3 elimination mechanisms of the pollutants table 1 demonstrated that the concentrations of pollutants suffered drastic declines after chemical mineralization which might be eliminated via two pathways 1 adsorption onto the precipitates generated during the pretreatment process and 2 co precipitation with the secondary iron mineral during mineralization period to specifically analyze the elimination mechanism of each contaminant ion their distribution in pretreated precipitate iron mineral neutralized sludge and effluent were calculated and shown in fig 5 obviously fe was mainly removed from the pickling liquor in the form of secondary mineral and about 58 of so4 2 was eliminated by co precipitation with fe for the metal ions in spent pickling liquor they were mainly co precipitated with the secondary iron mineral and a small part was eliminated by the precipitation pretreatment si was mainly removed by mineralization treatment these results clearly indicated that the pollutants in pickling liquor were mostly removed in mineralization process and the subsequent neutralization procedure mainly contributed to the elevation of solution ph 3 3 environmental application of the secondary mineral 3 3 1 identification and the structural characteristics the iron minerals obtained during chemical mineralization treatments were identified as schwertmannite with reference to the standard xrd pattern pdf 47 1775 fig s6 the resultant schwertmannites were red brown in appearance but the minerals formed from chemical mineralization following bacl2 sch ba and cacl2 sch ca pretreatments had darker color compared with that synthesized in feso4 solution sch ck fig 6 in addition the morphological characteristics of sch ba and sch ca were distinctly different from sch ck sem images of sch ck showed many loose particles with uneven sizes fig s7 which was comprised of abundant uniform nanoparticles fig 6a previous studies demonstrated that chemosynthetic schwertmannite had a uniform spheroidal structure with size range of 0 6 0 9 µm wang et al 2021a zhang et al 2018 but the supply speed of h2o2 and solution ph during reaction process would greatly influence the morphology of resultant mineral feng et al 2021 liu et al 2015 zhang et al 2019 zhou et al 2021 generally ph regulation decreased the particle size and thus increased the specific surface area while a slow h2o2 addition facilitated the formation of needles on the spherical surface and improved mineral crystallinity in this study the high initial fe2 concentration 62 g l promoted the rapid accumulation of the mineral nucleus which might inhibit the formation of needle like structure on particle surface even though the final morphology of sch ck was irregular particle it had high specific surface area 229 9 m2 g and pore volume 0 27 cm3 g fig 6a however sch ba and sch ca were composed of many irregular flakes or blocks fig 6b and c with smooth and dense surface morphology fig s7 accordingly their corresponding specific surface areas and pore volumes were rather low 0 6 0 7 m2 g and 0 002 0 003 cm3 g respectively the elemental compositions of sch ba and sch ca demonstrated that cr ni mn cu and si in spent pickling liquor were co precipitated with the secondary mineral and their contents reached 45 69 7 9 10 14 0 3 0 4 and 0 2 0 3 mg g respectively fig s8 undoubtedly the coprecipitation reactions of these ions were also responsible for the morphology change of the secondary minerals 3 3 2 adsorption ability toward as iii schwertmannite is reported to be an excellent adsorbent for metal oxyanions especially as iii as v and cr vi regenspurg and peiffer 2005 wang et al 2021c the environmental application of the secondary minerals obtained from mineralization process was evaluated by their adsorption performances for as iii as shown in fig 7 a sch ck sch ba and sch ca exhibited similar adsorption behaviors in the as iii range of 10 400 mg l the adsorption data fitted better with langmuir isotherm fig 7b indicating that the adsorption process was dominated by monolayer sorption dou et al 2013 the maximum adsorption capacity q max of sch ck calculated by langmuir model 339 8 mg g was much higher than that reported in previous literatures 110 218 mg g liao et al 2011 song et al 2015 it was well known that the mechanism of as iii adsorption on schwertmannite included the substitution of structural so4 2 and the coordination with surface hydroxyl groups antelo et al 2012 burton et al 2009 regenspurg and peiffer 2005 therefore the high adsorption ability of sch ck might be attributed to its large specific surface area 229 9 m2 g which provided abundant active sites for as iii sorption unexpectedly although sch ba and sch ca minerals had rather small specific surface areas 0 6 0 7 m2 g and pore volumes 0 002 0 003 cm3 g fig 6 their maximum adsorption capacities were basically same as sch ck 337 9 and 364 2 mg g respectively fig 7b the fe s molar ratios of sch ba and sch ca calculated from the elemental composition in fig s8 were 3 17 and 2 82 respectively which were much lower than that of sch ck 4 6 this result indicated that sch ba and sch ca minerals had a much higher so4 2 content than sch ck previous study reported that the relatively high sulfate content was indicative of the presence of inner and outer sphere complexes and the latter sulfate played a more relevant role in the anion exchange mechanism antelo et al 2012 under neutral and alkaline conditions the mechanism of anion exchange reactions with the structural sulfate played a more dominant role for as iii adsorption burton et al 2009 wang et al 2021c therefore the high so4 2 contents mainly endowed sch ba and sch ca minerals with high efficiency adsorption abilities toward as iii in addition it was worth noting that the toxic cr embedded in sch ba and sch ca minerals did not significantly release during adsorption process corresponding to concentration lower than 5 µg l based on the above analyses one possibility to utilize the resulting secondary minerals is to treat as iii pollution as an adsorbent 3 4 economic evaluation of the mineralization neutralization technology to evaluate the economic benefits of the chemical mineralization alkali neutralization technology the reagent input and product output were analyzed throughout the entire treatment process fig 8 results showed that the reagents consumed by mineralization neutralization treatment were largely concentrated in mineralization process including bacl2 cacl2 pretreatment agent h2o2 and alkali whereas the dosages of alkali used for neutralization were extremely low from the perspective of reagent consumption mineralization neutralization method seemed to be expensive however the main products schwertmannite and pretreated precipitates had high economic values which could offset part of disposal costs the pretreated sludges were identified as baso4 112 g l and caso4 80 g l precipitates fig s9 with high purity fig s10 which possessed high application values and could be used as soil conditioner or paints li et al 2019 shainberg et al 1989 the secondary schwertmannite mineral 213 219 g l was proved to be an effective adsorbent for as iii fig 7 it had a high market value about 1500 3000 cny ton with fe powder and magnetite as references and its application could be further extended to fenton catalysis and soil remediation li et al 2021 yang et al 2017 furthermore the low yield of neutralized sludge 2 4 10 9 g l would greatly reduce the subsequent disposal cost toward hazard solid wastes about 1000 3000 cny for disposing 1 ton of waste considering the economic values of secondary products and the treatment cost of neutralized sludge mineralization neutralization technology has a high economy efficiency cacl2 pretreatment was a versatile and low cost method to meet the mineralization condition in comparison to dilution and bacl2 precipitation to further reduce the cost of reagents lime slurry might be an alternative pretreatment reagent to replace alkali and partial cacl2 because it could elevate solution ph and precipitate part of so4 2 at the same time zhang et al 2021 our experiments proved that a mixture of 60 g l of cao and 50 g l cacl2 could make the pickling solution meet the mineralization condition therefore the economy efficiency of mineralization neutralization technology can be further improved by reducing the costs of pretreatment reagent in mineralization process 4 conclusions modified mineralization neutralization was a cost effective method to treat the sulfur acid spent pickling solution in iron rich solutions with concentration higher than 30 g l high so4 2 fe2 molar ratio 2 0 usually inhibited the mineralization process by inducing gelation phenomena pretreatment with cacl2 was a common and low cost method to meet the mineralization condition by precipitation with so4 2 ion chemical mineralization converted more than 90 of iron in spent pickling liquor into secondary schwertmannite in the subsequent neutralization treatment a small amount of alkali was enough to neutralize solution acidity and precipitate residual metal ions the final products including secondary iron mineral and cacl2 pretreated precipitate mainly gypsum possessed high economic and environmental values the modified chemical mineralization alkaline neutralization is an available technology for the treatment of the acidic iron rich waters for practical application the mineralization conditions must be further optimized according to fe and so4 2 concentrations in wastewater in addition several regulating strategies should be explored to reduce the metal impurities contents in resultant schwertmannite mineral so that its environmental application can be further extended to fenton catalysis and soil remediation credit authorship contribution statement xiaomeng

15998,mineralization coupled with neutralization is a dual function technology for disposing acidic iron rich waters which can recover the valuable iron in the form of secondary mineral and concurrently purify the wastewater in this study a modified technology for treating high fe wastewater sulfur acid spent pickling liquor 62 g fe l was proposed based on the specific investigation of the mineralization behaviors in fe concentration range of 20 70 g l results showed that high so4 2 fe2 molar ratio 2 0 tended to trigger gelation phenomena at fe concentrations above 30 g l fe specie distribution suggested that the insufficient polymerization among fe oh complexes might be responsible for the gelation phenomena since the strong fe so4 coordination almost completely suppressed the fex oh y 3x y form a general terms of fe3 hydrolysates and their polymers modified mineralization strategies were proposed including pretreatment with dilution or bacl2 cacl2 precipitation of which cacl2 pretreatment was a versatile and low cost method following cacl2 pretreatment chemical mineralization converted above 90 of iron into secondary mineral which therefore drastically reduced the alkali consumption from 164 2 g l to 1 4 g l and sludge yield from 328 1 g l to 2 4 g l in subsequent neutralization treatment the resultant mineral was identified as schwertmannite and exhibited efficient adsorption capacity toward arsenite 364 2 mg g the modified chemical mineralization alkaline neutralization is a cost effective technology for the treatment of the acidic iron rich waters in practical applications several regulating strategies should be further explored to improve the mineral purity and the mineralization conditions must be optimized according to the fe and so4 2 concentrations in wastewater graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords chemical mineralization strongly acidic wastewater alkali neutralization secondary iron mineral arsenite adsorption 1 introduction acidic iron rich waters are the by products of a variety of industrial operations such as mining and stainless steel processing they are generally characterized by extremely low ph elevated concentrations of metals fe al mn and possibly other toxic heavy metals such as cr cu pb ni etc johnson and hallberg 2005 regel rosocka 2010 the acidic water has become a serious global issue owing to its hazardous impact on ecological environment and human health mineralization coupled with neutralization is an alternative technology with low economic cost and high social benefit to dispose such wastewater jin et al 2020 wang et al 2019b wang et al 2021b acid mine drainage amd is a typical acidic water rich in iron and sulfate which is produced by the biological and abiotic oxidation of iron pyrite mineral park et al 2019 for the treatment of amd mineralization neutralization strategy achieves dual goals of resource recovery and wastewater purification wang et al 2019b wang et al 2021b 1 mineralization procedure effectively converts more than 90 of iron and about 50 of sulfate into iron oxy hydroxysulfate minerals mainly jarosite or schwertmannite which are valuable functional materials and possess wide applications in the field of environmental remediation 2 neutralization treatment eliminates the residual metal ions and neutralizes the acidity of solution which only requires a small amount of alkali the neutralization efficiency is closely associated with the removal efficiency of iron ion during mineralization process wang et al 2021b therefore mineralization is the core process determining the environmental value of the secondary mineral and the treatment cost of the mineralization neutralization technology mineralization process can be triggered by biological or chemical procedures the former is mainly mediated by fe2 oxidizing bacteria jin et al 2020 wang et al 2019a wang et al 2021b while the latter usually involves a hydrogen peroxide h2o2 driven reaction wang et al 2019b compared with biological strategy chemical mineralization requires less reaction time to achieve a more than 90 removal efficiency of iron chemical mineralization is initiated by h2o2 which involved two reactions 1 fe2 is oxidized into fe3 and 2 fe3 hydrolyzes and precipitates with so4 2 to form a secondary mineral zhang et al 2018 the type of resulting iron mineral can be regulated by altering the reaction environment such as solution ph and the concentration of monovalent cation bai et al 2012 generally schwertmannite is an optimal mineral specie because it has a wide prospect of applications in environmental fields as heterogeneous fenton catalyst adsorbent and soil remediation agent li et al 2021 meng et al 2021 wang et al 2021a yang et al 2017 in addition the morphology and properties of schwertmannite can be further optimized by altering the supply rate of h2o2 for example a slow addition mode facilitates the formation of a mineral with smaller size and higher specific surface area zhang et al 2019 mineralization neutralization has been proved to be a novel technology to remediate amd and its application in other acidic wastewater treatment is worthy of further exploration spent pickling liquor is a kind of strongly acidic wastewater which contains much higher acidity and metal concentrations than amd spent pickling liquor is generally produced in the steel processing industry where the pickling step is indispensable to obtain a high quality steel surface for further processing agrawal and sahu 2009 sulfur acid and hydrochloric acid are usually used to remove oxides on the surface of metal and the acid solution is considered spent when its concentration decreases by 75 85 regel rosocka 2010 the iron concentration in a typical spent pickling liquor reaches 80 250 g l accompanied by an acid concentration of 30 200 g l regel rosocka 2010 yang et al 2019 spent pickling liquor is considered hazardous waste according to both european union eu and environmental protection agency epa legislation jarosz krzemińska et al 2015 from the viewpoint of environment protection and economic benefit recovery of valuable resources is necessary and vital for the treatment of spent pickling liquor a number of technologies have been reported to recover the acid or metal ions including membrane separation pyrometallurgy evaporation precipitation neutralization ion exchange and crystallization regel rosocka 2010 several studies also attempted to utilize the spent pickling liquor as iron precursor to synthesize iron based materials i e composite polymeric ferric aluminum sulfate chloride coagulant magnetic biochar and a series of modified nanoscale zero valent irons which were further applied in environmental wastewater and soil remediation fang et al 2010 lian et al 2019 wang et al 2014 yang et al 2019 yi et al 2019 considering that iron is the main metal ion in spent pickling liquor mineralization neutralization technology may be feasible for metal recovery and wastewater purification the sulfur acid spent pickling liquor is used to investigate the mineralization neutralization technology in this study which is based on the following two considerations 1 sulfur acid is commonly used for pickling and is more difficult to be recovered than hydrochloric acid regel rosocka 2010 2 sulfate ion is requisite to form schwertmannnite during mineralization process zhang et al 2018 therefore the objectives of this study were to 1 investigate the mineralization behaviors in the acidic solution containing high concentrations of fe2 and so4 2 2 explore appropriate pretreatment methods to satisfy the mineralization demand in sulfur acid pickling waste liquor 3 evaluate the environmental application of the resultant secondary iron mineral as an adsorbent and 4 analyze the economic benefit of the modified mineralization neutralization technology the outcomes of this study would expand the application of mineralization technology in acidic fe and so4 2 rich wastewater and provide a near zero discharge technology for the treatment of the spent pickling

amount of fe3 and the so4 2 concentration was up to 243 g l the molar ratio of so4 2 fe was 2 3 2 2 chemical mineralization in high fe solutions chemical mineralization was conducted as the following procedures the ph of the fe2 containing solution was firstly adjusted to 2 5 a certain volume of h2o2 molar ratio of h2o2 fe2 was 0 8 was added to the above solution in a slow addition mode divide h2o2 into six equal volumes and add one portion every 30 min the mixture solution was shaken at 180 rpm for 24 h 25 c throughout the reaction the solution ph was maintained at 2 5 by adjusting with 0 1 m h2so4 or naoh pure feso4 solution was used to investigate the mineralization conditions at high concentrations of fe 20 70 g l to test the effect of so4 2 concentration on mineralization efficiency nh4 2so4 was added to feso4 solution to obtain a so4 2 fe2 molar ratio range of 1 0 4 0 the concentrations of fe2 and fe3 were measured at predetermined time intervals and the mineralization phenomenon was directly observed by naked eyes 2 3 treatment of spent pickling liquor with modified mineralization neutralization method based on the mineralization behaviors at high fe concentrations the sulfuric acid spent pickling liquor was firstly subjected to pretreatment via two methods 1 diluted with deionized water and 2 precipitated with bacl2 or cacl2 for dilution pretreatment the waste liquor was diluted 2 3 6 and 10 times respectively pretreatment with bacl2 or cacl2 was conducted in 500 ml conical flasks containing 200 ml pickling liquor the doses of bacl2 were set at 80 120 160 200 and 320 g l and cacl2 were 40 80 120 and 160 g l respectively after adding bacl2 or cacl2 to the pickling liquor the mixture was shaken at 180 rpm for 1 h and then centrifuged at 6000 g for 10 min to separate the precipitate a volume of 5 ml solution was withdrawn from the supernatant and filtered through a 0 45 µm membrane to analyze the water quality parameters the precipitate formed during pretreatment process was rinsed three times with deionized water and collected after vacuum dried at 60 c for 24 h the supernatant was further subjected to chemical mineralization treatment prior to mineralization treatment solution ph was firstly adjusted to 2 5 with 1 0 m and 0 1 m naoh a certain volume of h2o2 h2o2 fe2 molar ratio at 0 8 was slowly added to the pickling liquor 200 ml in six batches every 30 min the mixture was shaken at 180 rpm for 24 h and the solution ph was maintained at 2 5 during the entire reaction process after that the resultant mineral was separated with a filter paper respectively rinsed three times with dilute h2so4 solution ph 2 0 and deionized water and completely dried at 60 c for 24 h the concentrations of residual metal ions in supernatant were assayed after filtration through a 0 45 µm membrane the weight of secondary mineral and the consumption of alkali were recorded in each treatment after chemical mineralization treatment 100 ml of supernatant was withdrawn and subjected to alkali neutralization test a naoh solution 1 0 m was added dropwise to adjust solution ph to about 7 5 in addition the raw pickling liquor was also tested as a control the resultant neutralized sludge was filtered and rinsed with deionized water the consumption of alkali was recorded and the yield of dried sludge was weighed the water quality parameters of the effluent were analyzed after filtration through a 0 45 µm membrane 2 4 adsorption tests the adsorption abilities of the secondary minerals toward as iii

schwertmannite synthesized from feso4 h2o2 system sch ck initial fe2 concentration was 62 g l adsorption was conducted by adding 0 01 g mineral to 40 ml as iii containing solution with concentration range of 10 400 mg l the mixture was shaken for 24 h in a reciprocating shaker at 180 rpm 25 c solution ph was controlled at 7 0 during the entire reaction process after 24 h the solution was filtered through a 0 45 µm membrane to determine the residual as iii concentration two adsorption isotherms langmuir and freundlich models were used to fit the adsorption data and calculate the maximum

was performed on a tristar ii 3020 surface area pore size analyzer macmillan usa operated at 77 k the specific surface area was calculated based on brunauer emmett teller bet method 2 6 calculation of fe species fe species were calculated with visual minteq version 3 1 software concentrations of the major ions fe3 fe2 and so4 2 were introduced in the modeling programs under a temperature of 25 c precipitation and aqueous reactions were provided by the standard databases in the chemical equilibrium program the predominance diagrams of fe species versus ph dependencies were plotted based on the model output 3 results and discussion 3 1 mineralization behaviors at high fe concentrations 3 1 1 effect of so4 2 fe2 molar ratio on chemical mineralization a series of mineralization experiments were conducted in different initial fe2 solutions with varying molar ratios of so4 2 fe2 the presence of nh4 ion originated from nh4 2so4 would not affect the formation process of schwertmannite mineral bai et al 2012 results showed that the initial fe2 concentration and so4 2 fe2 molar ratio greatly influenced the mineralization behaviors under the current experimental condition solution ph was maintained at 2 5 and h2o2 was slowly added in six batches at high fe2 concentrations 30 g l secondary precipitates were finally generated in the solutions with low so4 2 fe2 molar ratios whereas the reaction solutions with high so4 2 fe2 ratios appeared gelation phenomena fig 1 as for gelation of solution initial fe concentration was 50 g l the reaction mixture became sticky at 3 h and turned into a viscous gel at 4 h fig s2 the viscous solution inhibited the formation of secondary iron mineral in addition the gelation phenomena were more likely to occur at higher fe2 concentration even though the molar ratio of so4 2 fe2 was slightly lower for example gelation began to appear at so4 2 fe2 ratio of 2 0 in 50 g l of fe2 solution whereas the ratio of 1 5 could induce gelation at fe2 concentration of 60 g l fig s3 from these results we concluded that the molar ratio of so4 2 fe directly influenced the mineralization behaviors in the solutions with high iron concentrations 30 g l and the threshold value corresponding to the lowest so4 2 fe ratio for gelation formation gradually decreased as the iron concentration elevated in addition the supply speed of h2o2 also had a significant influence on the gelation formation when h2o2 was quickly poured into feso4 solution so4 2 fe2 ratio was 1 0 with concentration higher than 50 g fe l the reaction solution started to gelate at 4 h fig s4 the supply speed of h2o2 was directly related to the oxidation conversion of fe2 to fe3 zhang et al 2019 a rapid addition of h2o2 would induce a large amount of fe3 ion to accumulate in solution according to the formation mechanism of secondary minerals we inferred that the enrichment of fe3 ions might be responsible for the gelation formation 3 1 2 mechanism involved in gelation phenomena chemical mineralization in feso4 solution mainly involves two reactions 1 the oxidation of fe2 and 2 the hydrolysis and precipitation of fe3 schoepfer and burton 2021 in feso4 h2o2 system at ph 2 5 schwertmannite is the predominant mineral phase instead of the other secondary iron minerals such as jarosite and ferrihydrite caraballo et al 2013 schwertmannite is a structurally distorted akaganéite and double chains of edge sharing feo6 octahedra form tunnel structure 0 5 nm where sulfate ions are presumably located majzlan and myneni 2005 wang et al 2015 in solution with ph 1 0 fe3 ion tends to hydrolyze into fe oh 2 or fe oh 2 forms flynn jr 1984 the resultant hydrolysates transform into hydroxo complexes and then polymerize into polynuclear complexes such as fe2 oh 3 3 or fe3 oh 2 7 zhang et al 2018 the akaganéite structure was the energetically preferred coordination form after a series of olation and oxolation reactions regenspurg et al 2004 sulfate further shares o ions with the feo6 octahedra by specific interactions which thus resulting in the distorted akaganéite structure of schwertmannite blgham et al 1990 regenspurg et al 2004 in general the fe3 hydrolysates and their polymers collectively referred to fex oh y 3x y species were the precursors of feo6 octahedra and their percentages directly determined the formation efficiency of schwertmannite feng et al 2021 to elaborate the mineralization behaviors at high fe concentrations fe3 species plotted with solution ph was calculated under different initial concentrations and so4 2 fe3 molar ratios fig 2 obviously various fe species coexisted in solution including fe3 feso4 fe so4 2 and fex oh y 3x y at ph below 2 5 most of dissolved fe3 coordinated with so4 2 at high fe3 concentration 20 g l feso4 was the main specie at ph lower than 3 0 whereas the percentage of fe so4 2 significantly exceeded feso4 when threefold so4 2 existed in solution fig 2a these results indicated that the coordination between fe3 and so4 2 was very strong therefore oh needed to compete with sulfate for coordination sites to form fe3 hydroxy polymers and subsequent fe3 hydroxides as shown in fig 2 the initial fe3 concentration and so4 2 fe3 ratio had significant influences on the distribution percentage of fex oh y 3x y form specifically as the molar ratio of so4 2 fe3 increased from 1 1 to 3 1 fex oh y 3x y specie was completely inhibited at ph 3 5 in 20 g l of fe3 solution fig 2a whereas its percentage was slightly decreased in dilute fe3 solution 2 g l fig 2b in other words the presence of the abundant fe so4 complexes greatly inhibited the polymerization reactions of fe3 hydrolysates finally viscous gel was formed in such solution due to the lack of adequate ostwald ripening reactions however the increase of so4 2 fe3 ratio did not dramatically inhibit the fex oh y 3x y specie in dilute fe3 solution 2 0 g l fig 2b therefore secondary iron minerals could be successfully formed after chemical mineralization reactions in general since fe3 tended to coordinate with so4 2 ion in high fe and so4 2 solution the insufficient polymerization reaction among fe oh complexes might be the main reason responsible for the gelation phenomena 3 2 modified mineralization neutralization method for the treatment of sulfur acid spent pickling liquor 3 2 1 chemical mineralization following dilution or precipitation pretreatment for chemical mineralization in high fe solution dilution is a feasible method to expand the workable so4 2 fe2 ratio by reducing the initial fe2 concentration the raw spent pickling liquor was subjected to 2 3 6 and 10 fold dilution respectively and then conducted with chemical mineralization treatments as shown in fig 3 a the conversion efficiency of fe2 was very high and fe2 was completely oxidized to fe3 within 2 h in the raw water and 2 fold dilution sets fe concentration could not be detected after 2 h due to the formation of viscous solutions gelation phenomenon occurred in the raw spent pickling liquor when direct mineralization was conducted by adding slowly h2o2 and maintaining ph at 2 5 fig s5 the mineralization behaviors in feso4 nh4 2so4 solution fig 1 clearly demonstrated that the initial fe2 concentration must be lower than 30 g l to be effectively mineralized in a solution with so4 2 fe2 ratio of 2 3 the value in pickling liquor therefore the raw spent pickling liquor should be diluted at least 3 times fig 3b further presented the corresponding fe precipitation efficiency obviously maintaining solution ph at 2 5 greatly improved the mineralization efficiency 82 at 6 h compared with the mineralization process without ph adjustment about 30 wang et al 2019b the mineralization efficiencies in 6 times and 10 times diluted wastewaters were significantly higher than that of 3 fold dilution indicating that a higher dilution factor was more conducive to chemical mineralization these results clearly showed that the mineralization efficiency after dilution pretreatment was greatly affected by the dilution factor which was directly determined by the concentrations of fe2 and so4 2 in the raw pickling liquor although dilution pretreatment was a simple and low cost method to meet the demand of chemical mineralization it inevitably multiplied the processing volume for further mineralization process therefore dilution pretreatment was not recommended as a versatile pretreatment method prior to chemical mineralization based on the mineralization behaviors at different fe concentrations fig 1a another alternative method is to directly reduce the concentration of so4 2 in the spent pickling liquor which can be realized by precipitating so4 2 with bacl2 ba2 so4 2 baso4 or cacl2 ca2 so4 2 caso4 the solubility product constant k sp of baso4 precipitate is much lower than that of caso4 1 1 10 10 vs 6 1 10 5 at 25 c rumble 2021 indicating that ba2 is more likely to precipitate with so4 2 ion however fig 4 clearly showed that a lower dose of cacl2 80 g l was sufficient to achieve the mineralization requirement whereas at least 120 g l of bacl2 was necessary for obtaining the similar result the higher precipitation efficiency of cacl2 over the equal dosed bacl2 was attributed to its lower molecular weight therefore more so4 2 was precipitated by a larger molar concentration of ca2 ion the so4 2 fe2 ratio decreased from 2 3 to 2 0 1 2 1 0 and 0 9 respectively by adding 80 320 g l of bacl2 fig 4a whereas a dose of 40 160 g l of cacl2 reduced the ratio to 2 0 1 4 1 3 and 1 0 respectively fig 4b as expected gelation phenomena appeared after reaction for 4 h in the sets of so4 2 fe2 ratio higher than 2 0 raw water 80 g l bacl2 and 40 g l cacl2 in other sets ochreous precipitates finally formed after 24 h almost 100 of fe and approximate 50 of so4 2 were removed from the pickling liquor in the form of secondary mineral fig 4 for chemical mineralization in this pickling wastewater at least 120 g l bacl2 or 80 g l cacl2 was required to reduce the so4 2 concentration considering the precipitation efficiency and reagent price cacl2 was more suitable as the pretreatment reagent than bacl2 3 2 2 promoting effect on subsequent alkali neutralization alkali was aimed to neutralize solution acidity and precipitate the residual metal ions devi et al 2014 compared with lime sodium hydroxide has a higher neutralization efficiency because the precipitation reaction between ca2 and so4 2 so4 2 ca2 caso4 will greatly increase the lime consumption johnson and hallberg 2005 after the raw pickling waste liquor was directly neutralized to ph 7 5 fe concentration decreased from 62 47 to 3 34 g l and so4 2 reduced from 243 1 to 162 2 g l table 1 the concentrations of the other metal ions greatly reduced below 0 01 g l except for mn 1 68 g l and ni 0 12 g l it was because mn2 precipitated as mn oh 2 at solution ph above about 8 5 corresponding to its solubility product constant k sp of 2 06 10 13 tang et al 2015 the amount of alkali required for direct neutralization was as high as 164 2 g l and 328 1 g l of neutralized sludge was generated after neutralization treatment table 2 compared with direct neutralization the neutralization efficiency was greatly improved after chemical mineralization treatments the concentrations of metal ions after mineralization treatments were very low table 1 mineralization following bacl2 or cacl2 pretreatments reduced the fe concentration from 62 5 g l to less than 0 5 g l whereas the residual fe after dilution pretreatment was slightly higher 1 0 g l table 1 in addition more than half of the so4 2 were removed from the pickling liquor and the cr ni mn cu and si concentrations were also drastically reduced after mineralization neutralization treatment the concentrations of ni and mn were slightly lower than those in direct neutralization table 1 to neutralize the effluents after mineralization treatments only 1 4 1 6 g l of alkali was consumed in bacl2 or cacl2 pretreatment sets whereas a weight of 32 3 g l was required in dilution pretreatment set table 2 the amounts of neutralized sludges were 2 4 10 9 g l which were drastically lower than that produced by direct neutralization 328 1 g l table 2 the neutralized sludges contained high contents of fe 67 mg g cr 38 mg g ni 40 mg g mn 8 3 mg g and cu 0 5 mg g table 2 the neutralized sludges were listed as hazardous wastes hw17 surface processing waste according to the national hazardous waste directory 2021 edition issued by the ministry of ecology and environment of the people s republic of china therefore the mineralization neutralization treatment would greatly reduce the subsequent disposal costs toward the hazardous wastes 3 2 3 elimination mechanisms of the pollutants table 1 demonstrated that the concentrations of pollutants suffered drastic declines after chemical mineralization which might be eliminated via two pathways 1 adsorption onto the precipitates generated during the pretreatment process and 2 co precipitation with the secondary iron mineral during mineralization period to specifically analyze the elimination mechanism of each contaminant ion their distribution in pretreated precipitate iron mineral neutralized sludge and effluent were calculated and shown in fig 5 obviously fe was mainly removed from the pickling liquor in the form of secondary mineral and about 58 of so4 2 was eliminated by co precipitation with fe for the metal ions in spent pickling liquor they were mainly co precipitated with the secondary iron mineral and a small part was eliminated by the precipitation pretreatment si was mainly removed by mineralization treatment these results clearly indicated that the pollutants in pickling liquor were mostly removed in mineralization process and the subsequent neutralization procedure mainly contributed to the elevation of solution ph 3 3 environmental application of the secondary mineral 3 3 1 identification and the structural characteristics the iron minerals obtained during chemical mineralization treatments were identified as schwertmannite with reference to the standard xrd pattern pdf 47 1775 fig s6 the resultant schwertmannites were red brown in appearance but the minerals formed from chemical mineralization following bacl2 sch ba and cacl2 sch ca pretreatments had darker color compared with that synthesized in feso4 solution sch ck fig 6 in addition the morphological characteristics of sch ba and sch ca were distinctly different from sch ck sem images of sch ck showed many loose particles with uneven sizes fig s7 which was comprised of abundant uniform nanoparticles fig 6a previous studies demonstrated that chemosynthetic schwertmannite had a uniform spheroidal structure with size range of 0 6 0 9 µm wang et al 2021a zhang et al 2018 but the supply speed of h2o2 and solution ph during reaction process would greatly influence the morphology of resultant mineral feng et al 2021 liu et al 2015 zhang et al 2019 zhou et al 2021 generally ph regulation decreased the particle size and thus increased the specific surface area while a slow h2o2 addition facilitated the formation of needles on the spherical surface and improved mineral crystallinity in this study the high initial fe2 concentration 62 g l promoted the rapid accumulation of the mineral nucleus which might inhibit the formation of needle like structure on particle surface even though the final morphology of sch ck was irregular particle it had high specific surface area 229 9 m2 g and pore volume 0 27 cm3 g fig 6a however sch ba and sch ca were composed of many irregular flakes or blocks fig 6b and c with smooth and dense surface morphology fig s7 accordingly their corresponding specific surface areas and pore volumes were rather low 0 6 0 7 m2 g and 0 002 0 003 cm3 g respectively the elemental compositions of sch ba and sch ca demonstrated that cr ni mn cu and si in spent pickling liquor were co precipitated with the secondary mineral and their contents reached 45 69 7 9 10 14 0 3 0 4 and 0 2 0 3 mg g respectively fig s8 undoubtedly the coprecipitation reactions of these ions were also responsible for the morphology change of the secondary minerals 3 3 2 adsorption ability toward as iii schwertmannite is reported to be an excellent adsorbent for metal oxyanions especially as iii as v and cr vi regenspurg and peiffer 2005 wang et al 2021c the environmental application of the secondary minerals obtained from mineralization process was evaluated by their adsorption performances for as iii as shown in fig 7 a sch ck sch ba and sch ca exhibited similar adsorption behaviors in the as iii range of 10 400 mg l the adsorption data fitted better with langmuir isotherm fig 7b indicating that the adsorption process was dominated by monolayer sorption dou et al 2013 the maximum adsorption capacity q max of sch ck calculated by langmuir model 339 8 mg g was much higher than that reported in previous literatures 110 218 mg g liao et al 2011 song et al 2015 it was well known that the mechanism of as iii adsorption on schwertmannite included the substitution of structural so4 2 and the coordination with surface hydroxyl groups antelo et al 2012 burton et al 2009 regenspurg and peiffer 2005 therefore the high adsorption ability of sch ck might be attributed to its large specific surface area 229 9 m2 g which provided abundant active sites for as iii sorption unexpectedly although sch ba and sch ca minerals had rather small specific surface areas 0 6 0 7 m2 g and pore volumes 0 002 0 003 cm3 g fig 6 their maximum adsorption capacities were basically same as sch ck 337 9 and 364 2 mg g respectively fig 7b the fe s molar ratios of sch ba and sch ca calculated from the elemental composition in fig s8 were 3 17 and 2 82 respectively which were much lower than that of sch ck 4 6 this result indicated that sch ba and sch ca minerals had a much higher so4 2 content than sch ck previous study reported that the relatively high sulfate content was indicative of the presence of inner and outer sphere complexes and the latter sulfate played a more relevant role in the anion exchange mechanism antelo et al 2012 under neutral and alkaline conditions the mechanism of anion exchange reactions with the structural sulfate played a more dominant role for as iii adsorption burton et al 2009 wang et al 2021c therefore the high so4 2 contents mainly endowed sch ba and sch ca minerals with high efficiency adsorption abilities toward as iii in addition it was worth noting that the toxic cr embedded in sch ba and sch ca minerals did not significantly release during adsorption process corresponding to concentration lower than 5 µg l based on the above analyses one possibility to utilize the resulting secondary minerals is to treat as iii pollution as an adsorbent 3 4 economic evaluation of the mineralization neutralization technology to evaluate the economic benefits of the chemical mineralization alkali neutralization technology the reagent input and product output were analyzed throughout the entire treatment process fig 8 results showed that the reagents consumed by mineralization neutralization treatment were largely concentrated in mineralization process including bacl2 cacl2 pretreatment agent h2o2 and alkali whereas the dosages of alkali used for neutralization were extremely low from the perspective of reagent consumption mineralization neutralization method seemed to be expensive however the main products schwertmannite and pretreated precipitates had high economic values which could offset part of disposal costs the pretreated sludges were identified as baso4 112 g l and caso4 80 g l precipitates fig s9 with high purity fig s10 which possessed high application values and could be used as soil conditioner or paints li et al 2019 shainberg et al 1989 the secondary schwertmannite mineral 213 219 g l was proved to be an effective adsorbent for as iii fig 7 it had a high market value about 1500 3000 cny ton with fe powder and magnetite as references and its application could be further extended to fenton catalysis and soil remediation li et al 2021 yang et al 2017 furthermore the low yield of neutralized sludge 2 4 10 9 g l would greatly reduce the subsequent disposal cost toward hazard solid wastes about 1000 3000 cny for disposing 1 ton of waste considering the economic values of secondary products and the treatment cost of neutralized sludge mineralization neutralization technology has a high economy efficiency cacl2 pretreatment was a versatile and low cost method to meet the mineralization condition in comparison to dilution and bacl2 precipitation to further reduce the cost of reagents lime slurry might be an alternative pretreatment reagent to replace alkali and partial cacl2 because it could elevate solution ph and precipitate part of so4 2 at the same time zhang et al 2021 our experiments proved that a mixture of 60 g l of cao and 50 g l cacl2 could make the pickling solution meet the mineralization condition therefore the economy efficiency of mineralization neutralization technology can be further improved by reducing the costs of pretreatment reagent in mineralization process 4 conclusions modified mineralization neutralization was a cost effective method to treat the sulfur acid spent pickling solution in iron rich solutions with concentration higher than 30 g l high so4 2 fe2 molar ratio 2 0 usually inhibited the mineralization process by inducing gelation phenomena pretreatment with cacl2 was a common and low cost method to meet the mineralization condition by precipitation with so4 2 ion chemical mineralization converted more than 90 of iron in spent pickling liquor into secondary schwertmannite in the subsequent neutralization treatment a small amount of alkali was enough to neutralize solution acidity and precipitate residual metal ions the final products including secondary iron mineral and cacl2 pretreated precipitate mainly gypsum possessed high economic and environmental values the modified chemical mineralization alkaline neutralization is an available technology for the treatment of the acidic iron rich waters for practical application the mineralization conditions must be further optimized according to fe and so4 2 concentrations in wastewater in addition several regulating strategies should be explored to reduce the metal impurities contents in resultant schwertmannite mineral so that its environmental application can be further extended to fenton catalysis and soil remediation credit authorship contribution statement xiaomeng

15999,urbanised beaches are regularly impacted by faecal pollution but management actions to resolve the causes of contamination are often obfuscated by the inability of standard faecal indicator bacteria fib analyses to discriminate sources of faecal material or detect other microbial hazards including antibiotic resistance genes args we aimed to determine the causes spatial extent and point sources of faecal contamination within rose bay a highly urbanised beach within sydney australia s largest city using molecular microbiological approaches sampling was performed across a network of transects originating at 9 stormwater drains located on rose bay beach over the course of a significant 67 5 mm rainfall event whereby samples were taken 6 days prior to any rain on the day of initial rainfall 3 8 mm three days later after 43 mm of rain and then four days after any rain quantitative pcr qpcr was used to target marker genes from bacteria i e lachnospiraceae and bacteroides that have been demonstrated to be specific to human faeces sewage along with gene sequences from heliobacter and bacteriodes that are specific to bird and dog faeces respectively and args suli teta qnrs dfra1 and vanb 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing was also used to discriminate microbial signatures of faecal contamination prior to the rain event low fib levels mean 2 4 cfu 100 ml were accompanied by generally low levels of the human and animal faecal markers with the exception of one transect potentially indicative of a dry weather sewage leak following 43 mm of rain levels of both human faecal markers increased significantly in stormwater drain and seawater samples with highest levels of these markers pinpointing several stormwater drains as sources of sewage contamination during this time sewage contamination was observed up to 1000 m from shore and was significantly and positively correlated with often highly elevated levels of the args dfra1 qnrs suli and vanb significantly elevated levels of the dog faecal marker in stormwater drains at this time also indicated that rainfall led to increased input of dog faecal material from the surrounding catchment using 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing several indicator taxa for stormwater contamination such as arcobacter spp and comamonadaceae spp were identified and the bayesian sourcetracker tool was used to model the relative impact of specific stormwater drains on the surrounding environment revealing a heterogeneous contribution of discrete stormwater drains during different periods of the rainfall event with the microbial signature of one particular drain contributing up to 50 of bacterial community in the seawater directly adjacent by applying a suite of molecular microbiological approaches we have precisely

particularly when located within urbanised settings these environments often experience reduced water quality which can sometimes cause substantial public health risks mclellan et al 2015 contamination of coastal waters can often simultaneously be derived from diverse sources including urban and industrial runoff nevers et al 2018 faeces from native nguyen et al 2018 and domesticated animals green et al 2014b and sewage mclellan et al 2015 however pinpointing the principal causes of contamination and subsequent degradation of water quality can often be challenging impeding effective management urban stormwater which is washed into coastal environments in large volumes after rainfall events tsihrintzis and hamid 2001 can contain potential pathogens delivered into the environment from numerous sources such as the surfaces of built infrastructure soils and animal faeces mclellan et al 2015 stormwater pipes are also often contiguous to sewerage infrastructure and can experience sewage inputs during dry weather due to pipe blockages and leaks and following rainfall during wet weather sewer over flow events as a result untreated sewage can often be introduced to aquatic environments through stormwater infrastructure olds et al 2018 contamination of urbanised beaches by sewage is a major public health concern who 2009 because sewage is enriched in pathogens including viruses such as rotavirus norovirus and adenovirus strubbia et al 2019 protistan parasites such as giardia duodenalis and cryptosporidium efstratiou et al 2017 and bacteria such as escherichia coli anastasi et al 2012 and arcobacter species fisher et al 2014 the global economic impact of human illness linked to faecal contamination of coastal waters has been estimated to exceed 12 billion a year shuval 2003 in addition to pathogens sewage and impacted water infrastructure also contains other microbiological hazards including high levels of antibiotic resistant microbes karkman et al 2019 widespread use of antibiotics in medicine and agricultural settings kunin et al 1973 results in large quantities of these chemicals in wastewater which are difficult to remove during wastewater treatment ahmed et al 2015a as a result microbial assemblages inhabiting human waste streams are exposed to consistently high levels of antibiotics michael et al 2013 resulting in selection for antibiotic resistance bougnom et al 2019 in addition antimicrobial resistance can also accumulate in the guts of medicated patients who then shed resistant bacteria into sewage steinbakk et al 1992 these resistant bacteria can be introduced into coastal environments during stormwater and sewage over flows carney et al 2019 where they can pose a public health risk leonard et al 2018 faecal contamination of aquatic habitats can also originate from agricultural dwight et al 2005 domestic ervin et al 2014 and native animals araújo et al 2014 and can enter the environment in urban and agricultural lewis et al 2019 runoff or via animals excreting their faeces directly into the environment araújo et al 2014 lewis et al 2019 while often not given the same attention as sewage contamination high levels of contamination by animal faeces can also potentially pose a human health hazard because animal faeces also harbour both pathogens sobsey et al 2011 and antibiotic resistance bacteria ortega paredes et al 2019 most coastal water quality monitoring programs quantify the presence of faecal contamination in the environment using standardised approaches to enumerate specific microbes referred to as faecal indicator bacteria fib fib include bacterial species e g e coli clostridium perfringens and enterococci who 2009 that reside in the faeces of warm blooded animals layton et al 2010 but rarely exist in significant numbers within uncontaminated waters meaning they can be used as indicators of faecal contamination byappanahalli et al 2012 fib based assessments of coastal water quality however have two significant limitations firstly most fib are not restricted to human faeces sewage but are present in the faeces of many other warm blooded animals byappanahalli et al 2012 which can create ambiguity around the true source of faecal contamination i e human vs animal within an environment the second limitation of fib methods is that they are insensitive to other microbial hazards in the environment including endemic aquatic pathogens fisher et al 2014 antibiotic resistance genes args carney et al 2019 and other emerging pathogens present in wastewater infrastructure mclellan and roguet 2019 these limitations can both obfuscate the source of contamination and overlook potential health hazards to overcome the shortcomings of fib analyses microbial source tracking mst approaches have been increasingly adopted to deliver more precise information on the sources of faecal contamination in natural environments ahmed et al 2020 mst typically employs molecular microbiological methods such as quantitative pcr qpcr feng et al 2018 green et al 2014a 2014b 2012 templar et al 2016 and more recently dna sequencing approaches brumfield et al 2021 newton et al 2013a to quantify specific microbial marker genes whilst one potential caveat of dna based approaches is that they may sometimes detect a signal from unviable cells potentially leading to over estimates of impact they have continuously been able to unambiguously identify sources of faecal contamination within an environment ahmed et al 2020 2019 alm et al 2018 green et al 2019 li et al 2021b shrestha et al 2020 urbanised coastal ecosystems are regularly negatively impacted by a wide variety of contamination sources which can enter the environment from multiple potential sources and it is often very difficult for managers to pinpoint both the cause and point sources of contamination here we used an urbanised beach as a model environment to demonstrate the utility of microbial source tracking and dna sequencing approaches to elucidate the source i e animal faeces vs sewage and location of faecal contamination our principal goals were to determine the source and location of input of faecal contamination using a combination of fib and mst qpcr techniques and then to detail the spatial and temporal distribution of contamination using 16s rrna amplicon sequencing 2 methods 2 1 sampling sites rose bay is an urban beach located in the sydney harbour estuary and near to the centre of sydney which is australia s largest city with a population of over 5 million people this site was targeted based on consistently poor water quality ratings according to regularly high fib levels within the regional water quality monitoring program beachwatch dpie 2020 the beach receives stormwater runoff from nine drain networks which feed directly onto the beach and is also a popular dog walking beach water samples were collected from a network of 10 transects comprising a total of 41 sampling locations fig 1 which were chosen according to proximity to potential points of contamination these included sampling points within the outlets of 9 stormwater drains which are mainly conduits for urban stormwater but in some instances may be impacted by wet weather sewer overflow events water samples were collected from points located along transects originating at points adjacent to each of these drains to examine the extent of dispersal of contamination from drains into rose bay surface seawater samples were collected along the transect from immediately adjacent to drains at the shoreline in water of 50 cm depth x 1 250 m offshore x 2 and 500 m offshore x 3 samples were also collected from a suite of reference points including the beachwatch routine monitoring site located at the western end of rose bay and a deep water transect across the entrance to rose bay x 4 located 1000 m offshore and used here to determine the broader spatial extent of faecal pollution from rose bay and the background contamination in sydney harbour finally samples were also collected from a control site within nielsen park sydney harbour national park which is located 2 km from rose bay has no urban stormwater infrastructure and dogs are prohibited on the beach sampling was conducted over the course a significant rainfall

mst markers quantitative pcr qpcr targeting the bacterial 16s rrna gene using the bact1369f and prok1492r primer pair and the tm1389f probe was used to provide a measure of bacterial abundance within each sample suzuki et al 2000 to detect the presence of human faeces we employed two qpcr analyses including the hf183 assay templar et al 2016 which targets human gut microbiome associated hf183 bacteroidales cluster and the lachno3 assay feng et al 2018 which targets human gut microbiome associated lachnospiraceae to detect faeces from dogs we used the dg3 assay green et al 2014b which targets dog specific bacteroidales and to detect faeces from birds we used the gfd assay green et al 2012 which targets bird specific heliobacter table 1 supplementary material qpcr was also used to quantify a suite of antibiotic resistance genes args that have previously been detected in high abundances at two sydney beaches exposed to wet weather associated sewage incursions carney et al 2019 including the genes suli which confers resistance to sulfonamide antibiotics in gram negative bacteria huovinen et al 1995 teta which encodes an inner membrane protein antiporter allard and bertrand 1991 which aids resistance to tetracycline qnrs encodes a pentapeptide protein that defends dna gyrase and topoisomerase iv from inhibition by quinolone berglund et al 2014 dfra1 which encodes a dihydrofolate reductase that confers resistance to the antibiotic trimethoprim lombardo et al 2016 and vanb which encodes resistance to vancomycin berglund et al 2014 which is a last line of defence antibiotic berglund et al 2014 each qpcr assay was performed using a bio rad cfx384 touch real time pcr detection system for qpcr assay details see table 1 supplementary material for each qpcr run gene copies were calculated for each target using a 6 7 point standard curve using bio rad s cfx maestrotm software version 1 1 standard curves were generated from known concentrations of a synthesised dna fragment of each targeted gene with a standard curve run with each plate samples outside of the calibration curve were considered below the limit of detection and included in the analysis as 0 each dna fragment for the standard curve was checked using mega7 to ensure they matched both primers the probe if applicable and target gene and blasted in the ncbi database to ensure it was from the correct target gene along with standard curves a no template control ntc was added to each qpcr run for further details on qpcr analysis see supplementary material section 1 1 2 5 16s sequencing and analysis to characterise bacterial community composition in seawater and stormwater drain samples the v3 v4 region of the bacterial 16s rrna gene was amplified using the 341f 805r primer set suzuki et al 2000 with the following cycling conditions 95 c for 3 min followed by 25 cycles of 95 c for 30 s 55 c for 30 s 72 c for 30 s and then 72 c for 5 min with a final hold at 4 c illumina 2013 amplicons were subsequently sequenced using the illumina miseq platform 300 bp paired end analysis at the ramaciotti institute of genomics university of new south wales for sequencing analysis details refer to supplementary material raw sequences were uploaded to ncbi bioproject id prjna766238 paired r1 and r2 reads were subsequently processed using the dada2 pipeline callahan et al 2016 reads with any n bases were removed and bacterial v3 v4 primers were truncated using cutadapt martin 2011 reads were trimmed to remove low quality terminal ends trunc r1 280 r2 250 to produce the highest number of merged reads after learning error rate and removing chimaeric sequences we used the dada2 removebimeradenovo program at the default threshold stringent minfoldparentoverabundance 1 asvs were annotated against the silva v138 database with a 50 probability cut off the asv table was subsequently filtered to remove asvs not assigned as kingdom bacteria as well as any asvs classified as chloroplast or mitochondria finally the dataset was rarefied to 30 000 reads using vegan dixon 2003 2 6 statistical analysis to test for differences in abiotic variables enterococci counts and qpcr copies 100 ml the nonparametric kruskal wallis test was used followed by mann whitney pairwise comparisons with bonferroni corrected p values correlations between enterococci counts and data derived from qpcr assays were determined using spearman s rs with bonferroni corrected p values these statisics were performed in past version 4 hammer et al 2001 to test for differences in microbial community composition and alpha diversity 16s rrna data between samples we used the adonis function from vegan dixon 2003 and the pairwise adonis function from the pairwiseadonis arbizu 2020 r package to determine which asvs were responsible for the dissimilarity between dry weather before and after rain event and wet weather both days of rain performed a simper analysis on square root transformed data to determine which asvs represented indicator taxa for drain communities the multipatt function within the indicspecies package de caceres and jansen 2018 was implemented using the drain and seawater communities identified asvs with an average relative abundance 0 01 were filtered from the resulting dataset finally we used the 16s rrna bacterial community profiles as a tracer of contamination from each stormwater drain experienced at the beachwatch reference site by applying the predict function within the r package sourcetracker knights et al 2011 this was performed by measuring the extent of microbial signature from source samples which included each of the stormwater drains as well as a seawater community control rose bay entrance 1 km offshore within a sink sample the beachwatch site we also used the output of sourcetracker to calculate and display the spatial extent of impact from specific stormwater drains across rose bay in this case the source samples were again drains and the sink samples were the rose bay seawater samples we analysed the contribution of drain 5 during dry weather drain 5 after 3 8 mm of rain drain 3 after 43 mm of rain and drain 6 post rain event for each analysis we created a grid with a high resolution of co ordinates 53 578 points and used the r package raster r hijmans et al 2010 to predict the data at these 53 578 points which were then plotted onto the map of rose bay for further details on indicator species and sourcetracker analysis see r scripts on github https github com nwilliams96 rose bay wet weather 2019 to test for differences between the contribution of individual drains on the beachwatch site and then differences between the contribution of single drains at the rose bay seawater sites

impacted salinity levels nearshore which were significantly lower p 0 01 when compared to samples that were taken 500 m offshore on the 27 8 19 second day of sampling a total of 3 8 mm of rainfall was recorded and on the 30 8 19 third day of sampling 43 mm of rain was recorded following this rain inputs of significantly p 0 01 more turbid mean 18 3 ntu 9 04 n 8 and fresh mean 3ppt 0 05 n 8 stormwater led to significant drops p 0 01 in both salinity and optical density of note after 43 mm of rain the samples nearshore were most impacted by stormwater with the salinity at these sites being significantly lower p 0 01 than sites 250 m and 500 m offshore with a mixing ratio of 1 34 one part freshwater to 34 parts seawater three days after the rain event 3 9 19 with 4 9 stormwater drains still running the salinity nearshore was again significantly lower nearshore p 0 01 compared to sites 250 m and 500 m offshore inputs of stormwater also led to a significant rise p 0 01 in chlorophyll filterable reactive phosphorus and total dissolved phosphate levels in contrast to the patterns observed within rose bay the rainfall event did not lead to a significant change within any of the tested environmental variables at the control site at nielsen park three days after the rain event levels of total phosphate in rose bay decreased significantly p 0 01 relative to during the rainfall event levels of nitrate nitrite total dissolved nitrogen and total nitrogen did not change significantly when comparing samples taken before the rain event 21 8 19 to samples taken during

those observed within the nielsen bay control site except for hf183 in the drain 9 transect highest seawater concentrations of these human faecal markers were always observed in samples immediately adjacent to drains fig 2b c this pattern was in line with the significantly higher p 0 01 concentrations of both human faecal marker genes hf183 mean 6 09 104 1 12 105 copies 100 ml n 12 lachno3 mean

increased by 17 fold relative to seawater samples taken before the rain event 21 8 19 with highest concentrations observed in samples adjacent to drain 5 consistent with patterns observed in the enterococci counts concentrations of both markers were generally very low beyond the immediate shoreline i e 250 m offshore further significant p 0 01 increases of both human faecal markers occurred within drains and adjacent seawater samples following a larger 43 mm 30 8 19 rainfall event across all drain samples concentrations of lachno3 and hf183 increased significantly p 0 01 by 109 and 76 times relative to conditions before the rain event on the 21 8 19 with highest concentrations of both markers observed within drain 3 fig 2b c the high concentrations of human faecal markers in drain

concentrations of human faecal markers recorded during this study period were observed while clear gradients in both lachno3 and hf183 were observed across the transect adjacent to drain 3 in most other transects there was an immediate decay in human faecal marker levels beyond the sample collected from immediately proximate to the drain which was consistent with the patterns observed in the

increased significantly p 0 01 within the stormwater drain samples with highest levels observed within drains 6 and 8 fig 3 a b c there was however no statistically distinguishable impact of rain on abr gene levels either 250 m 500 m or 1000 m offshore on this day however the number of samples that args were detected within increased with sul1detected in 46 n 14 30 of samples qnrs in 70 n 21 30

the proportion of samples this gene was detected in increasing from 1 n 1 30 to 16 n 5 30 of samples fig 3e notably following this rainfall event vanb was detected in drain 9 following 43 mm of rain levels of all abrs within the drains increased by an order of magnitude within rose bay seawater samples however the abrs followed one of two trends i increasing by an order of magnitude qnrs and vanb or ii remaining statistically indistinguishable from the preceding measurements teta and suli fig 3a e the only abr gene that did not follow one of these trends was dfra1 with levels decreasing by two orders of magnitude after heavy rain spatially patterns varied between genes with suli detected in 48 n 14 30 of samples and teta detected in one less sample relative to the preceding samling day in contrast qnrs dfra1 and vanb were all detected in a higher proportion 83 n 25 30 20 n 6 30 and 6 n 2 30 respectively of seawater samples compared to the preceding sampling day the highest levels of all antibiotic resistance genes except teta were observed within drain 3 and along the seawater sample transect adjacent to it where for example vanb was observed up to 500 m offshore fig 3c three days after the rain event levels of most of the abr genes except teta and dfra1 dropped significantly within the drains p 0 01 but remained high in the nearshore seawater samples as well as in samples collected 250 m and 500 m offshore with levels statistically indistinguishable from those recorded during the rainfall event in contrast to the other abr genes teta levels displayed a similar spatial

significantly between dry before the rain event and wet weather conditions 43 mm on the 30 8 19 fig 4 a the most abundant asvs in seawater samples were members of sar11 clade i the sar86 clade and an actinomarinales the dissimilarity in seawater bacterial communities observed between dry before the rain event and wet weather conditions 3 8 mm rain on the 27 8 19 and 43 mm on the 30 8 19 was primarily driven by a significant f 22 5 p 0 01 decrease in the relative abundance of sar11 clade i following rain and a concomitant increase in an asv classified as pseudarcobacter defluvii significant differences in the composition of bacterial communities inhabiting the stormwater drains relative to the seawater samples f 14 5 p 0 01 were also apparent fig 4b within stormwater drains the most abundant asvs included the same pseudarcobacter defluvii asv noted above a member of the spirosomaceae family and flavobacterium succinicans the dissimilarity in bacterial communities within the drains and seawater communities was largely driven by the same pseudarcobacter defluvii asv mentioned above and a member of the spirosomaceae family which were both over represented within the drain samples and a sar 11 clade i asv that was over represented in the seawater samples additionally the bacterial community also differed significantly between each individual drain f 5 5 p 0 01 3 5

this time drain indicator asvs were also detected at 11 of the sites located 250 m and 500 m offshore no drain indicator asvs were detected at the control site after 43 mm of rain the occurrence of drain indicator asvs increased further with these indicator organisms now detected in 66 n 20 30 of seawater samples these indicator organisms were most prevalant in the nearshore samples 3 1 and 4 1 where their cumulative relative abundance was 0 1 and 0 7 respectively with highest levels again observed in the near shore samples the drain indicator asvs were mainly restricted to transects 3 4 5 8 and 9 extending from nearshore to 500 m offshore supplementary figure 3 c of note the drain indicator taxa were detected in one site 1000 m offshore and up to 500 m offshore at the control site three days after the rainfall event the occurrence of drain indicator asvs remained high within rose bay seawater samples where they were detected in 87 n 25 29 of samples these asvs were detected in all nearshore samples and up to 500 m offshore along transects 3 5 and 10 3 5 3 impact of microbial signature from drain communities on rose bay to estimate the influence of each stormwater drain on water quality at the beachwatch reference site bw 2 supplementary figure 3 we used sourcetracker knights et al 2011 to examine the relative contribution of the microbial signature from each drain within at this reference sampling point used by local monitoring programs the relative contribution of the microbial signature from each drain on bw 2 mostly consisted of the rose bay entrance microbial community 99 which in this test was our control however our main focus was the change in impact from the drains which differed significantly over the time course of this study f 37 69 p 0 01 before the rain event 21 8 19 the microbial signature from drain 4 was 3 times higher than the cumulative contribution of the other running drains supplementary figure 3 a after 3 8 mm of rain the impact of all stormwater drains on the bw 2 bacterial community mean 0 001 0 0015 n 12 was significantly higher p 0 01 relative to dry weather conditions before the rain event mean 0 005 0 003 n 12 the relative impact of the drains also shifted with drain 5 now contributing between 1 and 4 times more than any of the other drains supplementary figure 3 b after the more significant rainfall event when 43 mm of rain fell the microbial signature of drains 3 5 and 9 had the largest impact on the bw 2 bacterial assemblage supplementary figure 3 c the overall level of impact from the drains on bw 2 did not change significantly 3 days after the rainfall event the impact source however shifted from drain 3 drain 5 and drain 9 to drains 4 and 6 which now had the largest level of impact on bw 2 supplementary figure 3 d to investigate the spatial impact of specific stormwater drains on rose bay over the course of the rainfall event we again used sourcetracker knights et al 2011 to investigate the contribution of the microbial assemblages within specific drains used here as a source on the microbial community within each sample within rose bay sink for each day of the study the specific drain chosen was the drain that had the highest levels of the lachno3 marker which equated to drain 5 before the rain event 21 8 19 and after 3 8 mm of rain drain 3 after 43 mm of rain and drain 6 after the rainfall event six days before the rain event 21 8 19 the microbial signature of drain 5 impacted all nearshore samples and samples located 250 m offshore but only impacted 50 n 4 8 of samples located 500 m offshore fig 6 a after 3 8 mm of rain the extent of impact from drain 5 increased to 93 n 28 30 of sites within rose bay impacting all but one site 500 m offshore and reaching two sites 1000 m offshore whilst the impact of this drain increased spatially mean 0 002 0 002 n 80 the contribution was significantly lower p 0 01 relative to dry weather conditions before the rain event mean 0 001 0 0007 n 92 fig 6b after 43 mm of rain the impact of the microbial signature from drain 3 reached 1000 m offshore fig 6 c and was significantly greater p 0 01 than the microbial impact from drain 5 relative to conditions before the rain event 21 8 19 and after 3 8 mm of rain 27 8 19 indeed using this approach it was apparent that the impact of drain 3 at this time was the greatest of any drain throughout the entire study period four days following the rainfall event the spatial impact of drain 6 on rose bay extended 500 m offshore fig 6d but had a significantly lower p 0 01 level of impact than drain 3 during heavy rain 4 discussion 4 1 what is the principal cause of faecal contamination at rose bay urban beaches are often characterised by poor water quality which has implications for human and ecosystem health mclellan et al 2015 routine fib monitoring has indicated that water quality at rose bay has been regularly impacted by faecal contamination for at least the last 7 years dpie 2020 oeh 2013 yet the causes and point sources of this contamination have not been identified by applying a suite of molecular microbiological approaches we have revealed significant levels of markers for human faeces indicative of sewage contamination during both dry weather periods before and after rainfall events which increased further during rain 3 8 mm rain on the 27 8 19 and 43 mm on the 30 8 19 to levels that are comparable to and sometimes higher than other aquatic environments known to be impacted by raw sewage liang et al 2021 this was paired with intermittent impacts from dog faeces in dry weather pre and post rain event detected only in nearshore and not drain samples indicating that it was sourced from dog faeces on the beach rather than the catchment serviced by the stormwater drains and most likely from runoff in the catchment during wet weather 3 8 mm rain on the 27 8 19 and 43 mm on the 30 8 19 due to the large amount of dg3 present within the drains before the rainfall event 21 8 19 enterococci levels within the seawater samples were generally low indicating good water quality but these levels became substantially elevated following rainfall the single exception to this pattern was the sample collected adjacent to drain 5 5 1 where enterococci levels were 180 cfu 100 ml notably these levels were higher than those recorded in the adjacent drain during this time both human markers were highly elevated relative to all other samples within drain 5 however the dog faecal marker was also elevated at site 5 1 but absent with the drain 5 sample these patterns imply one of two explanations for the moderate enterococci levels observed in this nearshore site 1 a combination of sewage and dog faecal material sourced from drain 5 has impacted this location 2 dog faecal material sourced from the beach has contributed to the moderately high enterococci levels measured at this location given that comparable levels of dg3 were recorded at other near shore sites 3 1 4 1 5 1 6 1 9 1 10 1 that did not exhibit elevated enterococci levels at this time we propose that the elevated enterococci levels within this sample were the result of a combinatory effect of human sewage from drain 5 and dog faecal material this potential dry weather sewage overflow resulted in levels of hf183 within the seawater that were in some cases higher than those that have elsewhere been estimated to indicate a significant health risk from sewage borne pathogens boehm and soller 2020 the sourcetracker analysis fig 6 a showed that the microbial signature from drain 5 was the strongest around transects 3 5 6 7 and offshore towards neilson park this aligns with locations that also had a higher level of hf183 therefore a sewage leak within drain 5 is a possible explanation for high background levels of hf183 before the rain event following a 43 mm rain on the 30 8 19 mean bacterial abundances within drains as estimated by 16s rrna qpcr increased by an order of magnitude and were over an order of magnitude higher than seawater bacterial abundances preceding the rainfall event when this stormwater entered rose bay in a mixing ratio of 1 34 levels of bacteria increased by 95 and 23 within rose bay seawater this pattern was confirmed by our sourcetracker analysis which revealed that the bacterial assemblages within seawater samples surrounding drain 3 were comprised of between 10 and 50 bacteria from drain 3 enterococci levels also increased significantly within both stormwater drain samples and seawater samples immediately adjacent to some drains within the drain and seawater samples where the highest enterococci levels occurred i e drain 3 and adjacent seawater samples drains 4 8 and 10 increases in both human faecal markers and the dog faecal marker were observed in drain 3 a substantial peak in both human faecal markers was observed with the elevated seawater enterococci levels spanning the drain 3 transect into rose bay also mirrored by increases in the human faecal markers we conclude that drain 3 and the surrounding waters within rose bay experience the most pronounced influence of sewage during rainfall events where levels of hf183 sometimes reached four orders of magnitude higher than those predicted to indicate a human health risk from sewage boehm and soller 2020 however in this drain as well as several of the other drains experiencing high enterococci levels during the rainfall event specifically drains 4 5 6 and 8 significant peaks in the dog faeces marker co occurred with peaks in the human faecal markers this indicates that both sewage and dog faeces potentially contribute to the high enterococci levels observed in stormwater drains during rainfall at rose bay which is a pattern consistent with reports from other coastal environments ahmed et al 2020 we posit that this pattern of concentration in and near to the stormwater drains is likely indicative of dog faeces being washed into the stormwater system from the surrounding catchment rather than significant levels of dog faeces being washed from the beach into the seawater at rose bay using 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing data we revealed the occurrence of a set of indicator bacteria which were present at a high relative abundance relative to seawater within stormwater samples but became detectable within seawater samples after rainfall notably these indicator bacteria including pseudarcobacter are known to be members of the bacterial communities inhabiting sewage mclellan et al 2015 providing further evidence for the impact of sewage within rose bay some of these taxa were intermittently detected within nearshore seawater samples before the rain event 21 8 19 but following the major rainfall event examined here were observed up to 1000 m offshore providing evidence for a spatially pronounced influence of sewage contamination across rose bay after rain while coastal environments can also be subject to faecal contamination from native animals in particular water birds jarma et al 2021 the marker for avian faeces did not display a statistically significant correlation to total enterococci counts nor an increase associated with either rainfall or proximity to drains furthermore given that i the levels of this bird faecal marker were not higher in rose bay than the control site and ii bird faecal marker levels in the seawater were always within the range of those observed in other coastal habitats pre rainfall ahmed et al 2020 we conclude that bird faeces played a minimal role in driving the elevated total enterococci levels observed during rainfall this however does not negate the possible health risks associated with a high level of bird faeces it has been demonstrated that the guts of birds can be colonised by antimicrobial resistant bacteria arb when birds ingest food from polluted water sources containing antimicrobial bacteria franklin et al 2020 this can then make them environmental reservoirs and vectors for arb and args ahlstrom et al 2018 bonnedahl and järhult 2014 and vectors for dissemination of args in the environment furhtermore it has been shown that bird faeces can contain human bacterial pathogens benskin et al 2009 cumulatively our results indicate that sewage input and input of dog faeces into rose bay contribute to high enterococci counts during periods of significant rainfall the main points of input of both forms of faecal material are stormwater drains which appear to experience contamination from sewage and in some cases dog faecal material from the catchment 4 2 what are the primary points of contamination within rose bay prior research has concluded that stormwater drains are responsible for input of sewage into recreationally used coastal environments during both dry and wet weather converse et al 2011 parker et al 2010 sauer et al 2011 sercu et al 2011 2009 given the elevated levels of both fib and the human faecal mst markers within stormwater drains during both dry before and after rainfall and wet weather 3 8 mm rain on the 27 8 19 and 43 mm on the 30 8 19 it is clear that the network of stormwater drains at rose bay are the key source of seawater contamination rather than the surrounding beach environment however some drains had a greater influence than others with the level of impact also varying according to whether sampling was conducted during dry before and after the rain event or wet weather 3 8 mm rain on the 27 8 19 and 43 mm on the 30 8 19 periods before the rain event on the 21 8 19 drain 5 exhibited elevated levels of both of the human faecal markers with these levels increasing further and extending into the adjacent seawater sample after the first moderate 3 8 mm rainfall event we suggest that these patterns are potentially indicative of a dry weather sewage leak into drain 5 which may have contributed to the slightly elevated enterococci levels within the 5 1 seawater sample before the rain event indeed at site sw5 1 levels of the lachno3 marker were 1 1 105 copies 100 ml prior to the rainfall event and the lachno3 and hf183 markers reached 1 98 107 copies 100 ml and 2 45 106 copies 100 ml respectively after 3 8 mm of rain while these levels are an order of magnitude lower observed in raw sewage sauer et al 2011 li et al 2021a they are high relative to concentrations observed in other coastal environments liang et al 2021 rothenheber and jones 2018 it is not uncommon for dry weather sewage leaks to occur within stormwater drains sercu et al 2009 and notably drain 5 is adjacent to a sewage pumping station behind rose bay beach which may contribute to high background levels of both sewage markers at neilson park and is potentially worthy of further examination these patterns are supported by our analysis of the 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing data using sourcetracker which highlighted drain 5 as the greatest point of impact on the beachwatch reference sample after 3 8 mm of rain this impact was not only high at the beachwatch site but extended 1000 m offshore both before the rain event and after 3 8 mm of rain additionally the 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing data also revealed the highest levels of sewage associated indicator species at site 5 1 both before the rain event and after 3 8 mm of rain following the major rainfall event highly elevated enterococci levels occurred in all drains with highest levels within drains 3 4 8 and 10 notably the rose bay seawater samples adjacent to several of these drains also showed highly elevated enterococci levels indicating a substantial impact on seawater quality in rose bay both human faecal markers were highly elevated within each of these drains and adjacent seawater samples with drains 3 and 10 clearly hotspots of sewage contamination in drain 3 hf183 reaching levels an order of magnitude lower than what has been previously detected in raw sewage hf183 sauer et al 2011 li et al 2021a a similar pattern was observed upon inspection of the 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing data whereby the sourcetracker data revealed drains 3 and 9 as the input points that had the highest impact on the beachwatch reference sample on this day this data also revealed that drain 3 had the highest impact on seawater samples across the entirety of rose bay given that concentrations of the human faecal markers became significantly elevated within these drains following the major rainfall event we suggest that drains 3 and 9 potentially represent sites most influenced by wet weather sewage overflows this is supported by the sourcetracker data whereby we observed these two drains as having the highest impact on the beachwatch site during the heavy rain event supplementary figure 3 c 4 3 spatiotemporal dynamics of contamination the sampling design employed during this study permitted a detailed investigation of the spatial and temporal patterns of multiple markers for faecal contamination over the course a rainfall event this analysis revealed that fib levels within rose bay increase significantly following rainfall and with proximity to stormwater drains with this pattern largely driven by sewage contamination of the drains with a further contribution from dog faecal material likely sourced from the catchment serviced by these drains while previous studies have shown increases of faecal contamination from either sewage or animal sources during rainfall events ahmed et al 2020 shrestha et al 2020 only few studies newton et al 2013 have assessed the spatial extent of impact for the most part high levels of the human and dog faecal markers were restricted to near shore samples drain 3 displayed highly elevated levels of the human faecal markers across several samples extending away from the shoreline and when used as a source when 16s rrna bacterial community data was employed as a tracer contributed to up to 50 of the bacterial communities within sink samples up to 500 m offshore along transects 3 and 4 this is indicative of a substantial influence of drain 3 on water quality within rose bay following rainfall four days after the major rainfall event slightly elevated levels of both human faecal markers persisted within the environment there are two potential explanations for this pattern i the lachnospiraceae and bacteriodes targeted by their respective assays can persist for longer periods than fib in the environment as shown by ahmed et al 2020 or ii the dna based rather than culture dependant approach used to quantify these markers detect unviable bacteria that would not grow via a culture based approach 4 4 other microbiological hazards in rose bay our results indicate that rose bay is extensively impacted by sewage contamination likely linked to sewage overflows into stormwater drains which may consequently create several hazardous microbiological implications over the course of the experiment we observed evidence for increased levels of args in the environment following rainfall which is consistent with recent studies in other urbanised beaches that are impacted by sewage contamination carney et al 2019 the putative links between elevated arg occurrence and sewage contamination akiyama and savin 2010 auguet et al 2017 gaviria figueroa et al 2019 was confirmed here by significant correlations between the hf183 human faecal marker and args dfra1 qnrs suli and vanb notably we observed levels of qnrs that were over two orders of magnitude higher than those previously reported within wastewater paulus et al 2019 and levels of vanb that were over 3 times higher than those observed at other highly contaminated beaches in sydney carney et al 2019 this emerging occurrence of high levels of args at rose bay represents a largely uncharacterised but potentially significant leonard et al 2018 health risk for swimmers 4 5 bacterial community analysis provides another powerful tool to analyse coastal water quality we coupled 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing with the bayesian sourcetracker package knights et al 2011 which uses bayesian statistics to predict the percentage of source microbial communities within selected sink samples sourcetracker has previously been used to track the occurrence of sewage bacterial communities in the environment newton et al 2013 and discern the relative contribution of faecal contamination from different sources including sewage plants and animals ahmed et al 2015b brown et al 2017 similarly to our study neave et al 2014 used sourcetracker to analyse the microbial signature from different inputs including a sewage outfall and a number of lakes sources at different beach sites sinks however to the best of our knowledge ours is the first study to use this approach to i track the spatiotemporal dynamics of specific bacterial signatures for individual stormwater drains and ii use this data to quantify the relative strength of the microbial signature from different stormwater drains additionally we coupled 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing with the indicspecies r package de caceres and jansen 2018 to identify specific microbial indicators of the water within stormwater drains and rose bay seawater samples this analysis revealed that several of the bacteria that could be characterised as indicators for stormwater drains were often aligned with organisms previously identified as indicators of sewage e g arcobacter mclellan et al 2015 one of the most prevalent indicator taxa was pseudarcobacter defluvii which was formerly known as arcobacter defluvii pérez cataluña et al 2018 pseudarcobacter defluvii has been isolated from sewage collado et al 2011 with strains of this organism isolated from sewage shown to be potential human pathogens levican et al 2013 furthermore our microbial indicator analysis also revealed other previously unrecognised putative markers for contamination of urbanised coastal habitats these included four comamonadaceae asvs and a spirosomaceae asv comamonadaceae are a family of bacteria which have also been reported as a core member of sewage sludge xu et al 2017 where they can make up to 10 of the cumulative relative abundance of effluent yasir 2021 while spirosomaceae has also been isolated from sewage sludge in korea lu et al 2007 implying that these asvs are likely sewage markers we acknowledge that this was indeed a single rain event with only four time points and that while our results are reflective of what happened at this time they may not be generalisable to rose bay at all times and in all rain events however in light of the outcomes of our analysis of 16s rrna community profiles we argue that dna sequencing data provides a powerful and largely untapped means to trace the extent and impact of water contamination in aquatic ecosystems this has the potential to augment other fib and mst approaches 5 conclusions many urban beaches are characterised by poor water quality because of often undefined sources of faecal contamination by employing molecular microbiological tools including mst assays and dna sequencing we have delivered a precise assessment of the causes and sources of contamination at an intermittently contaminated beach within sydney harbour australia whilst traditional fib methods indicated high levels of faecal contamination we used mst approaches to precisely identify the likely source of this contamination i e sewage vs animal our analysis demonstrated that rose bay is moderately impacted by dog and human faeces during dry weather both before and after the rainfall event but heavily impacted by human faeces sewage during wet weather after 3 8 mm and 43 mm rain additionally we identified the relative impact of individual stormwater drains on seawater quality by combining mst assays with dna sequencing techniques to trace the spatial and temporal dynamics of contamination this confirms that in cases where consistently high levels of fib are recorded by regular monitoring practises but the source of contamination remains ambiguous mst tools like those used here provide a powerful means for informing subsequent remediation and management efforts finally we identified the spatial and temporal dynamics of microbiological hazards associated with contamination including an increased occurrence of antibiotic resistance these more nuanced insights into the contributing factors to poor water quality at this highly urbanised coastal environment will inform efforts to resolve the causes of contamination and subsequently help to safeguard public health author contributions nathan l r williamsa nachshon sibonia

15999,urbanised beaches are regularly impacted by faecal pollution but management actions to resolve the causes of contamination are often obfuscated by the inability of standard faecal indicator bacteria fib analyses to discriminate sources of faecal material or detect other microbial hazards including antibiotic resistance genes args we aimed to determine the causes spatial extent and point sources of faecal contamination within rose bay a highly urbanised beach within sydney australia s largest city using molecular microbiological approaches sampling was performed across a network of transects originating at 9 stormwater drains located on rose bay beach over the course of a significant 67 5 mm rainfall event whereby samples were taken 6 days prior to any rain on the day of initial rainfall 3 8 mm three days later after 43 mm of rain and then four days after any rain quantitative pcr qpcr was used to target marker genes from bacteria i e lachnospiraceae and bacteroides that have been demonstrated to be specific to human faeces sewage along with gene sequences from heliobacter and bacteriodes that are specific to bird and dog faeces respectively and args suli teta qnrs dfra1 and vanb 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing was also used to discriminate microbial signatures of faecal contamination prior to the rain event low fib levels mean 2 4 cfu 100 ml were accompanied by generally low levels of the human and animal faecal markers with the exception of one transect potentially indicative of a dry weather sewage leak following 43 mm of rain levels of both human faecal markers increased significantly in stormwater drain and seawater samples with highest levels of these markers pinpointing several stormwater drains as sources of sewage contamination during this time sewage contamination was observed up to 1000 m from shore and was significantly and positively correlated with often highly elevated levels of the args dfra1 qnrs suli and vanb significantly elevated levels of the dog faecal marker in stormwater drains at this time also indicated that rainfall led to increased input of dog faecal material from the surrounding catchment using 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing several indicator taxa for stormwater contamination such as arcobacter spp and comamonadaceae spp were identified and the bayesian sourcetracker tool was used to model the relative impact of specific stormwater drains on the surrounding environment revealing a heterogeneous contribution of discrete stormwater drains during different periods of the rainfall event with the microbial signature of one particular drain contributing up to 50 of bacterial community in the seawater directly adjacent by applying a suite of molecular microbiological approaches we have precisely

particularly when located within urbanised settings these environments often experience reduced water quality which can sometimes cause substantial public health risks mclellan et al 2015 contamination of coastal waters can often simultaneously be derived from diverse sources including urban and industrial runoff nevers et al 2018 faeces from native nguyen et al 2018 and domesticated animals green et al 2014b and sewage mclellan et al 2015 however pinpointing the principal causes of contamination and subsequent degradation of water quality can often be challenging impeding effective management urban stormwater which is washed into coastal environments in large volumes after rainfall events tsihrintzis and hamid 2001 can contain potential pathogens delivered into the environment from numerous sources such as the surfaces of built infrastructure soils and animal faeces mclellan et al 2015 stormwater pipes are also often contiguous to sewerage infrastructure and can experience sewage inputs during dry weather due to pipe blockages and leaks and following rainfall during wet weather sewer over flow events as a result untreated sewage can often be introduced to aquatic environments through stormwater infrastructure olds et al 2018 contamination of urbanised beaches by sewage is a major public health concern who 2009 because sewage is enriched in pathogens including viruses such as rotavirus norovirus and adenovirus strubbia et al 2019 protistan parasites such as giardia duodenalis and cryptosporidium efstratiou et al 2017 and bacteria such as escherichia coli anastasi et al 2012 and arcobacter species fisher et al 2014 the global economic impact of human illness linked to faecal contamination of coastal waters has been estimated to exceed 12 billion a year shuval 2003 in addition to pathogens sewage and impacted water infrastructure also contains other microbiological hazards including high levels of antibiotic resistant microbes karkman et al 2019 widespread use of antibiotics in medicine and agricultural settings kunin et al 1973 results in large quantities of these chemicals in wastewater which are difficult to remove during wastewater treatment ahmed et al 2015a as a result microbial assemblages inhabiting human waste streams are exposed to consistently high levels of antibiotics michael et al 2013 resulting in selection for antibiotic resistance bougnom et al 2019 in addition antimicrobial resistance can also accumulate in the guts of medicated patients who then shed resistant bacteria into sewage steinbakk et al 1992 these resistant bacteria can be introduced into coastal environments during stormwater and sewage over flows carney et al 2019 where they can pose a public health risk leonard et al 2018 faecal contamination of aquatic habitats can also originate from agricultural dwight et al 2005 domestic ervin et al 2014 and native animals araújo et al 2014 and can enter the environment in urban and agricultural lewis et al 2019 runoff or via animals excreting their faeces directly into the environment araújo et al 2014 lewis et al 2019 while often not given the same attention as sewage contamination high levels of contamination by animal faeces can also potentially pose a human health hazard because animal faeces also harbour both pathogens sobsey et al 2011 and antibiotic resistance bacteria ortega paredes et al 2019 most coastal water quality monitoring programs quantify the presence of faecal contamination in the environment using standardised approaches to enumerate specific microbes referred to as faecal indicator bacteria fib fib include bacterial species e g e coli clostridium perfringens and enterococci who 2009 that reside in the faeces of warm blooded animals layton et al 2010 but rarely exist in significant numbers within uncontaminated waters meaning they can be used as indicators of faecal contamination byappanahalli et al 2012 fib based assessments of coastal water quality however have two significant limitations firstly most fib are not restricted to human faeces sewage but are present in the faeces of many other warm blooded animals byappanahalli et al 2012 which can create ambiguity around the true source of faecal contamination i e human vs animal within an environment the second limitation of fib methods is that they are insensitive to other microbial hazards in the environment including endemic aquatic pathogens fisher et al 2014 antibiotic resistance genes args carney et al 2019 and other emerging pathogens present in wastewater infrastructure mclellan and roguet 2019 these limitations can both obfuscate the source of contamination and overlook potential health hazards to overcome the shortcomings of fib analyses microbial source tracking mst approaches have been increasingly adopted to deliver more precise information on the sources of faecal contamination in natural environments ahmed et al 2020 mst typically employs molecular microbiological methods such as quantitative pcr qpcr feng et al 2018 green et al 2014a 2014b 2012 templar et al 2016 and more recently dna sequencing approaches brumfield et al 2021 newton et al 2013a to quantify specific microbial marker genes whilst one potential caveat of dna based approaches is that they may sometimes detect a signal from unviable cells potentially leading to over estimates of impact they have continuously been able to unambiguously identify sources of faecal contamination within an environment ahmed et al 2020 2019 alm et al 2018 green et al 2019 li et al 2021b shrestha et al 2020 urbanised coastal ecosystems are regularly negatively impacted by a wide variety of contamination sources which can enter the environment from multiple potential sources and it is often very difficult for managers to pinpoint both the cause and point sources of contamination here we used an urbanised beach as a model environment to demonstrate the utility of microbial source tracking and dna sequencing approaches to elucidate the source i e animal faeces vs sewage and location of faecal contamination our principal goals were to determine the source and location of input of faecal contamination using a combination of fib and mst qpcr techniques and then to detail the spatial and temporal distribution of contamination using 16s rrna amplicon sequencing 2 methods 2 1 sampling sites rose bay is an urban beach located in the sydney harbour estuary and near to the centre of sydney which is australia s largest city with a population of over 5 million people this site was targeted based on consistently poor water quality ratings according to regularly high fib levels within the regional water quality monitoring program beachwatch dpie 2020 the beach receives stormwater runoff from nine drain networks which feed directly onto the beach and is also a popular dog walking beach water samples were collected from a network of 10 transects comprising a total of 41 sampling locations fig 1 which were chosen according to proximity to potential points of contamination these included sampling points within the outlets of 9 stormwater drains which are mainly conduits for urban stormwater but in some instances may be impacted by wet weather sewer overflow events water samples were collected from points located along transects originating at points adjacent to each of these drains to examine the extent of dispersal of contamination from drains into rose bay surface seawater samples were collected along the transect from immediately adjacent to drains at the shoreline in water of 50 cm depth x 1 250 m offshore x 2 and 500 m offshore x 3 samples were also collected from a suite of reference points including the beachwatch routine monitoring site located at the western end of rose bay and a deep water transect across the entrance to rose bay x 4 located 1000 m offshore and used here to determine the broader spatial extent of faecal pollution from rose bay and the background contamination in sydney harbour finally samples were also collected from a control site within nielsen park sydney harbour national park which is located 2 km from rose bay has no urban stormwater infrastructure and dogs are prohibited on the beach sampling was conducted over the course a significant rainfall event which involved a total of 69 8 mm of rain falling over a period of five days including 43 mm within one 24 hour period samples were collected from the locations described above on four occasions

sufficient flow to be sampled on the 21 8 19 nor did drain 7 on the 27 8 19 or drains 2 5 7 9 and 10 on the 3 8 19 2 2 sample processing and analyses water samples were collected using 10 l pre sterilised plastic containers and filtered through 47 mm 0 22 µm pore size membrane filters millipore durapore pvdf 22um wh pl using a peristaltic pump 100 rpm within 2 hrs of sample collection before each sample was filtered 250 ml 10 bleach was run through the pump followed by 500 ml miliq water and then 1 l of sample filters were stored at 80 c until dna was extracted using the powerwater dna isolation kit qiagen dna extractions were performed in batches of either 48 or 96 with every batch including 3 kit blanks which were subsequently included in all qpcr analyses physiochemical

mst markers quantitative pcr qpcr targeting the bacterial 16s rrna gene using the bact1369f and prok1492r primer pair and the tm1389f probe was used to provide a measure of bacterial abundance within each sample suzuki et al 2000 to detect the presence of human faeces we employed two qpcr analyses including the hf183 assay templar et al 2016 which targets human gut microbiome associated hf183 bacteroidales cluster and the lachno3 assay feng et al 2018 which targets human gut microbiome associated lachnospiraceae to detect faeces from dogs we used the dg3 assay green et al 2014b which targets dog specific bacteroidales and to detect faeces from birds we used the gfd assay green et al 2012 which targets bird specific heliobacter table 1 supplementary material qpcr was also used to quantify a suite of antibiotic resistance genes args that have previously been detected in high abundances at two sydney beaches exposed to wet weather associated sewage incursions carney et al 2019 including the genes suli which confers resistance to sulfonamide antibiotics in gram negative bacteria huovinen et al 1995 teta which encodes an inner membrane protein antiporter allard and bertrand 1991 which aids resistance to tetracycline qnrs encodes a pentapeptide protein that defends dna gyrase and topoisomerase iv from inhibition by quinolone berglund et al 2014 dfra1 which encodes a dihydrofolate reductase that confers resistance to the antibiotic trimethoprim lombardo et al 2016 and vanb which encodes resistance to vancomycin berglund et al 2014 which is a last line of defence antibiotic berglund et al 2014 each qpcr assay was performed using a bio rad cfx384 touch real time pcr detection system for qpcr assay details see table 1 supplementary material for each qpcr run gene copies were calculated for each target using a 6 7 point standard curve using bio rad s cfx maestrotm software version 1 1 standard curves were generated from known concentrations of a synthesised dna fragment of each targeted gene with a standard curve run with each plate samples outside of the calibration curve were considered below the limit of detection and included in the analysis as 0 each dna fragment for the standard curve was checked using mega7 to ensure they matched both primers the probe if applicable and target gene and blasted in the ncbi database to ensure it was from the correct target gene along with standard curves a no template control ntc was added to each qpcr run for further details on qpcr analysis see supplementary material section 1 1 2 5 16s sequencing and analysis to characterise bacterial community composition in seawater and stormwater drain samples the v3 v4 region of the bacterial 16s rrna gene was amplified using the 341f 805r primer set suzuki et al 2000 with the following cycling conditions 95 c for 3 min followed by 25 cycles of 95 c for 30 s 55 c for 30 s 72 c for 30 s and then 72 c for 5 min with a final hold at 4 c illumina 2013 amplicons were subsequently sequenced using the illumina miseq platform 300 bp paired end analysis at the ramaciotti institute of genomics university of new south wales for sequencing analysis details refer to supplementary material raw sequences were uploaded to ncbi bioproject id prjna766238 paired r1 and r2 reads were subsequently processed using the dada2 pipeline callahan et al 2016 reads with any n bases were removed and bacterial v3 v4 primers were truncated using cutadapt martin 2011 reads were trimmed to remove low quality terminal ends trunc r1 280 r2 250 to produce the highest number of merged reads after learning error rate and removing chimaeric sequences we used the dada2 removebimeradenovo program at the default threshold stringent minfoldparentoverabundance 1 asvs were annotated against the silva v138 database with a 50 probability cut off the asv table was subsequently filtered to remove asvs not assigned as kingdom bacteria as well as any asvs classified as chloroplast or mitochondria finally the dataset was rarefied to 30 000 reads using vegan dixon 2003 2 6 statistical analysis to test for differences in abiotic variables enterococci counts and qpcr copies 100 ml the nonparametric kruskal wallis test was used followed by mann whitney pairwise comparisons with bonferroni corrected p values correlations between enterococci counts and data derived from qpcr assays were determined using spearman s rs with bonferroni corrected p values these statisics were performed in past version 4 hammer et al 2001 to test for differences in microbial community composition and alpha diversity 16s rrna data between samples we used the adonis function from vegan dixon 2003 and the pairwise adonis function from the pairwiseadonis arbizu 2020 r package to determine which asvs were responsible for the dissimilarity between dry weather before and after rain event and wet weather both days of rain performed a simper analysis on square root transformed data to determine which asvs represented indicator taxa for drain communities the multipatt function within the indicspecies package de caceres and jansen 2018 was implemented using the drain and seawater communities identified asvs with an average relative abundance 0 01 were filtered from the resulting dataset finally we used the 16s rrna bacterial community profiles as a tracer of contamination from each stormwater drain experienced at the beachwatch reference site by applying the predict function within the r package sourcetracker knights et al 2011 this was performed by measuring the extent of microbial signature from source samples which included each of the stormwater drains as well as a seawater community control rose bay entrance 1 km offshore within a sink sample the beachwatch site we also used the output of sourcetracker to calculate and display the spatial extent of impact from specific stormwater drains across rose bay in this case the source samples were again drains and the sink samples were the rose bay seawater samples we analysed the contribution of drain 5 during dry weather drain 5 after 3 8 mm of rain drain 3 after 43 mm of rain and drain 6 post rain event for each analysis we created a grid with a high resolution of co ordinates 53 578 points and used the r package raster r hijmans et al 2010 to predict the data at these 53 578 points which were then plotted onto the map of rose bay for further details on indicator species and sourcetracker analysis see r scripts on github https github com nwilliams96 rose bay wet weather 2019 to test for differences between the contribution of individual drains on the beachwatch site and then differences between the contribution of single drains at the rose bay seawater sites we used the nonparametric kruskal wallis test followed by dunn s post hoc pairwise comparisons with bonferroni corrected p values hammer et al 2001 drain 3 21 8 19 27 8 19 drain 9 27 8 19 and drain 10

impacted salinity levels nearshore which were significantly lower p 0 01 when compared to samples that were taken 500 m offshore on the 27 8 19 second day of sampling a total of 3 8 mm of rainfall was recorded and on the 30 8 19 third day of sampling 43 mm of rain was recorded following this rain inputs of significantly p 0 01 more turbid mean 18 3 ntu 9 04 n 8 and fresh mean 3ppt 0 05 n 8 stormwater led to significant drops p 0 01 in both salinity and optical density of note after 43 mm of rain the samples nearshore were most impacted by stormwater with the salinity at these sites being significantly lower p 0 01 than sites 250 m and 500 m offshore with a mixing ratio of 1 34 one part freshwater to 34 parts seawater three days after the rain event 3 9 19 with 4 9 stormwater drains still running the salinity nearshore was again significantly lower nearshore p 0 01 compared to sites 250 m and 500 m offshore inputs of stormwater also led to a significant rise p 0 01 in chlorophyll filterable reactive phosphorus and total dissolved phosphate levels in contrast to the patterns observed within rose bay the rainfall event did not lead to a significant change within any of the tested environmental variables at the control site at nielsen park three days after the rain event levels of total phosphate in rose bay decreased significantly p 0 01 relative to during the rainfall event levels of nitrate nitrite total dissolved nitrogen and total nitrogen did not change significantly when comparing samples taken before the rain event 21 8 19 to samples taken during

those observed within the nielsen bay control site except for hf183 in the drain 9 transect highest seawater concentrations of these human faecal markers were always observed in samples immediately adjacent to drains fig 2b c this pattern was in line with the significantly higher p 0 01 concentrations of both human faecal marker genes hf183 mean 6 09 104 1 12 105 copies 100 ml n 12 lachno3 mean

concentrations of human faecal markers recorded during this study period were observed while clear gradients in both lachno3 and hf183 were observed across the transect adjacent to drain 3 in most other transects there was an immediate decay in human faecal marker levels beyond the sample collected from immediately proximate to the drain which was consistent with the patterns observed in the

increased significantly p 0 01 within the stormwater drain samples with highest levels observed within drains 6 and 8 fig 3 a b c there was however no statistically distinguishable impact of rain on abr gene levels either 250 m 500 m or 1000 m offshore on this day however the number of samples that args were detected within increased with sul1detected in 46 n 14 30 of samples qnrs in 70 n 21 30 of samples and teta in 100 n 30 30 of samples fig 3a b and d rainfall also did not impact dfra1 levels within the drains but did however impact the spatial dynamics of dfra1 in seawater samples with the proportion of samples this gene was detected in increasing from 1 n 1 30 to 16 n 5 30 of samples fig 3e notably following this rainfall event vanb was detected in drain 9 following 43 mm of rain levels of all abrs within the drains increased by an order of magnitude within rose bay seawater samples however the abrs followed one of two trends i increasing by an order of magnitude qnrs and vanb or ii remaining statistically indistinguishable from the preceding measurements teta and suli fig 3a e the only abr gene that did not follow one of these trends was dfra1 with levels decreasing by two orders of magnitude after heavy rain spatially patterns varied between genes with suli detected in 48 n 14 30 of samples and teta detected in one less sample relative to the preceding samling day in contrast qnrs dfra1 and vanb were all detected in a higher proportion 83 n 25 30 20 n 6 30 and 6 n 2 30 respectively of seawater samples compared to the preceding sampling day the highest levels of all antibiotic resistance genes except teta were observed within drain 3 and along the seawater sample transect adjacent to it where for example vanb was observed up to 500 m offshore fig 3c three days after the rain event levels of most of the abr genes except teta and dfra1 dropped significantly within the drains p 0 01 but remained high in the nearshore seawater samples as well as in samples collected 250 m and 500 m offshore with levels statistically indistinguishable from those recorded during the rainfall event in contrast to the other abr genes teta levels displayed a similar spatial pattern to those observed during heavy rainfall whereby levels of this gene within the drain and nearshore samples were significantly higher p 0 01 than those within in the samples taken 250 m 500 m

significantly between dry before the rain event and wet weather conditions 43 mm on the 30 8 19 fig 4 a the most abundant asvs in seawater samples were members of sar11 clade i the sar86 clade and an actinomarinales the dissimilarity in seawater bacterial communities observed between dry before the rain event and wet weather conditions 3 8 mm rain on the 27 8 19 and 43 mm on the 30 8 19 was primarily driven by a significant f 22 5 p 0 01 decrease in the relative abundance of sar11 clade i following rain and a concomitant increase in an asv classified as pseudarcobacter defluvii significant differences in the composition of bacterial communities inhabiting the stormwater drains relative to the seawater samples f 14 5 p 0 01 were also apparent fig 4b within stormwater drains the most abundant asvs included the same pseudarcobacter defluvii asv noted above a member of the spirosomaceae family and flavobacterium succinicans the dissimilarity in bacterial communities within the drains and seawater communities was largely driven by the same pseudarcobacter defluvii asv mentioned above and a member of the spirosomaceae family which were both over represented within the drain samples and a sar 11 clade i asv that was over represented in the seawater samples additionally the bacterial community also differed significantly between each individual drain f 5 5 p 0 01 3 5

abundance of less than 0 1 within the drain samples 6 asvs remained including the same pseudarcobacter and spirosomaceae asvs that were most responsible for the significant differences between drain and seawater bacterial communities as well as 4 comamonadaceae asvs during dry weather prior to the rainfall event these drain indicator asvs were detected in only 23 n 7 30 of rose bay seawater samples where their cumulative relative abundance was a mean of 0 05 0 08 n 14 most of these detections 85 n 6 7 were in the nearshore samples fig 5 a with highest relative abundances observed in 5 1 0 19 drain indicator asvs were detected at one other site 10 3 500 m offshore no drain indicator asvs were detected within samples 250 m or 1000 m offshore nor were they detected at the control site following 3 8 mm of rain the occurrence of drain indicator asvs in seawater samples increased significantly with these asvs now detectable in 60 n 18 30 of rose bay seawater samples again the prevalence of drain indicator asvs was highest in the nearshore samples where they were detected within all samples except 7 1 mean cumulative relative abundance 0 09 0 02 n 37 the highest levels of drain indicator asvs were recorded at site 5 1 where the cumulative relative abundance of 1 2 was two orders of magnitude higher than the mean of all other nearshore samples mean 0 09 0 14 n 7 during this time drain indicator asvs were also detected at 11 of the sites located 250 m and 500 m offshore no drain indicator asvs were detected at the control site after 43 mm of rain the occurrence of drain indicator asvs increased further with these indicator organisms now detected in 66 n 20 30 of seawater samples these indicator organisms were most prevalant in the nearshore samples 3 1 and 4 1 where their cumulative relative abundance was 0 1 and 0 7 respectively with highest levels again observed in the near shore samples the drain indicator asvs were mainly restricted to transects 3 4 5 8 and 9 extending from nearshore to 500 m offshore supplementary figure 3 c of note the drain indicator taxa were detected in one site 1000 m offshore and up to 500 m offshore at the control site three days after the rainfall event the occurrence of drain indicator asvs remained high within rose bay seawater samples where they were detected in 87 n 25 29 of samples these asvs were detected in all nearshore samples and up to 500 m offshore along transects 3 5 and 10 3 5 3 impact of microbial signature from drain communities on rose bay to estimate the influence of each stormwater drain on water quality at the beachwatch reference site bw 2 supplementary figure 3 we used sourcetracker knights et al 2011 to examine the relative contribution of the microbial signature from each drain within at this reference sampling point used by local monitoring programs the relative contribution of the microbial signature from each drain on bw 2 mostly consisted of the rose bay entrance microbial community 99 which in this test was our control however our main focus was the change in impact from the drains which differed significantly over the time course of this study f 37 69 p 0 01 before the rain event 21 8 19 the microbial signature from drain 4 was 3 times higher than the cumulative contribution of the other running drains supplementary figure 3 a after 3 8 mm of rain the impact of all stormwater drains on the bw 2 bacterial community mean 0 001 0 0015 n 12 was significantly higher p 0 01 relative to dry weather conditions before the rain event mean 0 005 0 003 n 12 the relative impact of the drains also shifted with drain 5 now contributing between 1 and 4 times more than any of the other drains supplementary figure 3 b after the more significant rainfall event when 43 mm of rain fell the microbial signature of drains 3 5 and 9 had the largest impact on the bw 2 bacterial assemblage supplementary figure 3 c the overall level of impact from the drains on bw 2 did not change significantly 3 days after the rainfall event the impact source however shifted from drain 3 drain 5 and drain 9 to drains 4 and 6 which now had the largest level of impact on bw 2 supplementary figure 3 d to investigate the spatial impact of specific stormwater drains on rose bay over the course of the rainfall event we again used sourcetracker knights et al 2011 to investigate the contribution of the microbial assemblages within specific drains used here as a source on the microbial community within each sample within rose bay sink for each day of the study the specific drain chosen was the drain that had the highest levels of the lachno3 marker which equated to drain 5 before the rain event 21 8 19 and after 3 8 mm of rain drain 3 after 43 mm of rain and drain 6 after the rainfall event six days before the rain event 21 8 19 the microbial signature of drain 5 impacted all nearshore samples and samples located 250 m offshore but only impacted 50 n 4 8 of samples located 500 m offshore fig 6 a after 3 8 mm of rain the extent of impact from drain 5 increased to 93 n 28 30 of sites within rose bay impacting all but one site 500 m offshore and reaching two sites 1000 m offshore whilst the impact of this drain increased spatially mean 0 002 0 002 n 80 the contribution was significantly lower p 0 01 relative to dry weather conditions before the rain event mean 0 001 0 0007 n 92 fig 6b after 43 mm of rain the impact of the microbial signature from drain 3 reached 1000 m offshore fig 6 c and was significantly greater p 0 01 than the microbial impact from drain 5 relative to conditions before the rain event 21 8 19 and after 3 8 mm of rain 27 8 19 indeed using this approach it was apparent that the impact of drain 3 at this time was the greatest of any drain throughout the entire study period four days following the rainfall event the spatial impact of drain 6 on rose bay extended 500 m offshore fig 6d but had a significantly lower p 0 01 level of impact than drain 3 during heavy rain 4 discussion 4 1 what is the principal cause of faecal contamination at rose bay urban beaches are often characterised by poor water quality which has implications for human and ecosystem health mclellan et al 2015 routine fib monitoring has indicated that water quality at rose bay has been regularly impacted by faecal contamination for at least the last 7 years dpie 2020 oeh 2013 yet the causes and point sources of this contamination have not been identified by applying a suite of molecular microbiological approaches we have revealed significant levels of markers for human faeces indicative of sewage contamination during both dry weather periods before and after rainfall events which increased further during rain 3 8 mm rain on the 27 8 19 and 43 mm on the 30 8 19 to levels that are comparable to and sometimes higher than other aquatic environments known to be impacted by raw sewage liang et al 2021 this was paired with intermittent impacts from dog faeces in dry weather pre and post rain event detected only in nearshore and not drain samples indicating that it was sourced from dog faeces on the beach rather than the catchment serviced by the stormwater drains and most likely from runoff in the catchment during wet weather 3 8 mm rain on the 27 8 19 and 43 mm on the 30 8 19 due to the large amount of dg3 present within the drains before the rainfall event 21 8 19 enterococci levels within the seawater samples were generally low indicating good water quality but these levels became substantially elevated following rainfall the single exception to this pattern was the sample collected adjacent to drain 5 5 1 where enterococci levels were 180 cfu 100 ml notably these levels were higher than those recorded in the adjacent drain during this time both human markers were highly elevated relative to all other samples within drain 5 however the dog faecal marker was also elevated at site 5 1 but absent with the drain 5 sample these patterns imply one of two explanations for the moderate enterococci levels observed in this nearshore site 1 a combination of sewage and dog faecal material sourced from drain 5 has impacted this location 2 dog faecal material sourced from the beach has contributed to the moderately high enterococci levels measured at this location given that comparable levels of dg3 were recorded at other near shore sites 3 1 4 1 5 1 6 1 9 1 10 1 that did not exhibit elevated enterococci levels at this time we propose that the elevated enterococci levels within this sample were the result of a combinatory effect of human sewage from drain 5 and dog faecal material this potential dry weather sewage overflow resulted in levels of hf183 within the seawater that were in some cases higher than those that have elsewhere been estimated to indicate a significant health risk from sewage borne pathogens boehm and soller 2020 the sourcetracker analysis fig 6 a showed that the microbial signature from drain 5 was the strongest around transects 3 5 6 7 and offshore towards neilson park this aligns with locations that also had a higher level of hf183 therefore a sewage leak within drain 5 is a possible explanation for high background levels of hf183 before the rain event following a 43 mm rain on the 30 8 19 mean bacterial abundances within drains as estimated by 16s rrna qpcr increased by an order of magnitude and were over an order of magnitude higher than seawater bacterial abundances preceding the rainfall event when this stormwater entered rose bay in a mixing ratio of 1 34 levels of bacteria increased by 95 and 23 within rose bay seawater this pattern was confirmed by our sourcetracker analysis which revealed that the bacterial assemblages within seawater samples surrounding drain 3 were comprised of between 10 and 50 bacteria from drain 3 enterococci levels also increased significantly within both stormwater drain samples and seawater samples immediately adjacent to some drains within the drain and seawater samples where the highest enterococci levels occurred i e drain 3 and adjacent seawater samples drains 4 8 and 10 increases in both human faecal markers and the dog faecal marker were observed in drain 3 a substantial peak in both human faecal markers was observed with the elevated seawater enterococci levels spanning the drain 3 transect into rose bay also mirrored by increases in the human faecal markers we conclude that drain 3 and the surrounding waters within rose bay experience the most pronounced influence of sewage during rainfall events where levels of hf183 sometimes reached four orders of magnitude higher than those predicted to indicate a human health risk from sewage boehm and soller 2020 however in this drain as well as several of the other drains experiencing high enterococci levels during the rainfall event specifically drains 4 5 6 and 8 significant peaks in the dog faeces marker co occurred with peaks in the human faecal markers this indicates that both sewage and dog faeces potentially contribute to the high enterococci levels observed in stormwater drains during rainfall at rose bay which is a pattern consistent with reports from other coastal environments ahmed et al 2020 we posit that this pattern of concentration in and near to the stormwater drains is likely indicative of dog faeces being washed into the stormwater system from the surrounding catchment rather than significant levels of dog faeces being washed from the beach into the seawater at rose bay using 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing data we revealed the occurrence of a set of indicator bacteria which were present at a high relative abundance relative to seawater within stormwater samples but became detectable within seawater samples after rainfall notably these indicator bacteria including pseudarcobacter are known to be members of the bacterial communities inhabiting sewage mclellan et al 2015 providing further evidence for the impact of sewage within rose bay some of these taxa were intermittently detected within nearshore seawater samples before the rain event 21 8 19 but following the major rainfall event examined here were observed up to 1000 m offshore providing evidence for a spatially pronounced influence of sewage contamination across rose bay after rain while coastal environments can also be subject to faecal contamination from native animals in particular water birds jarma et al 2021 the marker for avian faeces did not display a statistically significant correlation to total enterococci counts nor an increase associated with either rainfall or proximity to drains furthermore given that i the levels of this bird faecal marker were not higher in rose bay than the control site and ii bird faecal marker levels in the seawater were always within the range of those observed in other coastal habitats pre rainfall ahmed et al 2020 we conclude that bird faeces played a minimal role in driving the elevated total enterococci levels observed during rainfall this however does not negate the possible health risks associated with a high level of bird faeces it has been demonstrated that the guts of birds can be colonised by antimicrobial resistant bacteria arb when birds ingest food from polluted water sources containing antimicrobial bacteria franklin et al 2020 this can then make them environmental reservoirs and vectors for arb and args ahlstrom et al 2018 bonnedahl and järhult 2014 and vectors for dissemination of args in the environment furhtermore it has been shown that bird faeces can contain human bacterial pathogens benskin et al 2009 cumulatively our results indicate that sewage input and input of dog faeces into rose bay contribute to high enterococci counts during periods of significant rainfall the main points of input of both forms of faecal material are stormwater drains which appear to experience contamination from sewage and in some cases dog faecal material from the catchment 4 2 what are the primary points of contamination within rose bay prior research has concluded that stormwater drains are responsible for input of sewage into recreationally used coastal environments during both dry and wet weather converse et al 2011 parker et al 2010 sauer et al 2011 sercu et al 2011 2009 given the elevated levels of both fib and the human faecal mst markers within stormwater drains during both dry before and after rainfall and wet weather 3 8 mm rain on the 27 8 19 and 43 mm on the 30 8 19 it is clear that the network of stormwater drains at rose bay are the key source of seawater contamination rather than the surrounding beach environment however some drains had a greater influence than others with the level of impact also varying according to whether sampling was conducted during dry before and after the rain event or wet weather 3 8 mm rain on the 27 8 19 and 43 mm on the 30 8 19 periods before the rain event on the 21 8 19 drain 5 exhibited elevated levels of both of the human faecal markers with these levels increasing further and extending into the adjacent seawater sample after the first moderate 3 8 mm rainfall event we suggest that these patterns are potentially indicative of a dry weather sewage leak into drain 5 which may have contributed to the slightly elevated enterococci levels within the 5 1 seawater sample before the rain event indeed at site sw5 1 levels of the lachno3 marker were 1 1 105 copies 100 ml prior to the rainfall event and the lachno3 and hf183 markers reached 1 98 107 copies 100 ml and 2 45 106 copies 100 ml respectively after 3 8 mm of rain while these levels are an order of magnitude lower observed in raw sewage sauer et al 2011 li et al 2021a they are high relative to concentrations observed in other coastal environments liang et al 2021 rothenheber and jones 2018 it is not uncommon for dry weather sewage leaks to occur within stormwater drains sercu et al 2009 and notably drain 5 is adjacent to a sewage pumping station behind rose bay beach which may contribute to high background levels of both sewage markers at neilson park and is potentially worthy of further examination these patterns are supported by our analysis of the 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing data using sourcetracker which highlighted drain 5 as the greatest point of impact on the beachwatch reference sample after 3 8 mm of rain this impact was not only high at the beachwatch site but extended 1000 m offshore both before the rain event and after 3 8 mm of rain additionally the 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing data also revealed the highest levels of sewage associated indicator species at site 5 1 both before the rain event and after 3 8 mm of rain following the major rainfall event highly elevated enterococci levels occurred in all drains with highest levels within drains 3 4 8 and 10 notably the rose bay seawater samples adjacent to several of these drains also showed highly elevated enterococci levels indicating a substantial impact on seawater quality in rose bay both human faecal markers were highly elevated within each of these drains and adjacent seawater samples with drains 3 and 10 clearly hotspots of sewage contamination in drain 3 hf183 reaching levels an order of magnitude lower than what has been previously detected in raw sewage hf183 sauer et al 2011 li et al 2021a a similar pattern was observed upon inspection of the 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing data whereby the sourcetracker data revealed drains 3 and 9 as the input points that had the highest impact on the beachwatch reference sample on this day this data also revealed that drain 3 had the highest impact on seawater samples across the entirety of rose bay given that concentrations of the human faecal markers became significantly elevated within these drains following the major rainfall event we suggest that drains 3 and 9 potentially represent sites most influenced by wet weather sewage overflows this is supported by the sourcetracker data whereby we observed these two drains as having the highest impact on the beachwatch site during the heavy rain event supplementary figure 3 c 4 3 spatiotemporal dynamics of contamination the sampling design employed during this study permitted a detailed investigation of the spatial and temporal patterns of multiple markers for faecal contamination over the course a rainfall event this analysis revealed that fib levels within rose bay increase significantly following rainfall and with proximity to stormwater drains with this pattern largely driven by sewage contamination of the drains with a further contribution from dog faecal material likely sourced from the catchment serviced by these drains while previous studies have shown increases of faecal contamination from either sewage or animal sources during rainfall events ahmed et al 2020 shrestha et al 2020 only few studies newton et al 2013 have assessed the spatial extent of impact for the most part high levels of the human and dog faecal markers were restricted to near shore samples drain 3 displayed highly elevated levels of the human faecal markers across several samples extending away from the shoreline and when used as a source when 16s rrna bacterial community data was employed as a tracer contributed to up to 50 of the bacterial communities within sink samples up to 500 m offshore along transects 3 and 4 this is indicative of a substantial influence of drain 3 on water quality within rose bay following rainfall four days after the major rainfall event slightly elevated levels of both human faecal markers persisted within the environment there are two potential explanations for this pattern i the lachnospiraceae and bacteriodes targeted by their respective assays can persist for longer periods than fib in the environment as shown by ahmed et al 2020 or ii the dna based rather than culture dependant approach used to quantify these markers detect unviable bacteria that would not grow via a culture based approach 4 4 other microbiological hazards in rose bay our results indicate that rose bay is extensively impacted by sewage contamination likely linked to sewage overflows into stormwater drains which may consequently create several hazardous microbiological implications over the course of the experiment we observed evidence for increased levels of args in the environment following rainfall which is consistent with recent studies in other urbanised beaches that are impacted by sewage contamination carney et al 2019 the putative links between elevated arg occurrence and sewage contamination akiyama and savin 2010 auguet et al 2017 gaviria figueroa et al 2019 was confirmed here by significant correlations between the hf183 human faecal marker and args dfra1 qnrs suli and vanb notably we observed levels of qnrs that were over two orders of magnitude higher than those previously reported within wastewater paulus et al 2019 and levels of vanb that were over 3 times higher than those observed at other highly contaminated beaches in sydney carney et al 2019 this emerging occurrence of high levels of args at rose bay represents a largely uncharacterised but potentially significant leonard et al 2018 health risk for swimmers 4 5 bacterial community analysis provides another powerful tool to analyse coastal water quality we coupled 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing with the bayesian sourcetracker package knights et al 2011 which uses bayesian statistics to predict the percentage of source microbial communities within selected sink samples sourcetracker has previously been used to track the occurrence of sewage bacterial communities in the environment newton et al 2013 and discern the relative contribution of faecal contamination from different sources including sewage plants and animals ahmed et al 2015b brown et al 2017 similarly to our study neave et al 2014 used sourcetracker to analyse the microbial signature from different inputs including a sewage outfall and a number of lakes sources at different beach sites sinks however to the best of our knowledge ours is the first study to use this approach to i track the spatiotemporal dynamics of specific bacterial signatures for individual stormwater drains and ii use this data to quantify the relative strength of the microbial signature from different stormwater drains additionally we coupled 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing with the indicspecies r package de caceres and jansen 2018 to identify specific microbial indicators of the water within stormwater drains and rose bay seawater samples this analysis revealed that several of the bacteria that could be characterised as indicators for stormwater drains were often aligned with organisms previously identified as indicators of sewage e g arcobacter mclellan et al 2015 one of the most prevalent indicator taxa was pseudarcobacter defluvii which was formerly known as arcobacter defluvii pérez cataluña et al 2018 pseudarcobacter defluvii has been isolated from sewage collado et al 2011 with strains of this organism isolated from sewage shown to be potential human pathogens levican et al 2013 furthermore our microbial indicator analysis also revealed other previously unrecognised putative markers for contamination of urbanised coastal habitats these included four comamonadaceae asvs and a spirosomaceae asv comamonadaceae are a family of bacteria which have also been reported as a core member of sewage sludge xu et al 2017 where they can make up to 10 of the cumulative relative abundance of effluent yasir 2021 while spirosomaceae has also been isolated from sewage sludge in korea lu et al 2007 implying that these asvs are likely sewage markers we acknowledge that this was indeed a single rain event with only four time points and that while our results are reflective of what happened at this time they may not be generalisable to rose bay at all times and in all rain events however in light of the outcomes of our analysis of 16s rrna community profiles we argue that dna sequencing data provides a powerful and largely untapped means to trace the extent and impact of water contamination in aquatic ecosystems this has the potential to augment other fib and mst approaches 5 conclusions many urban beaches are characterised by poor water quality because of often undefined sources of faecal contamination by employing molecular microbiological tools including mst assays and dna sequencing we have delivered a precise assessment of the causes and sources of contamination at an intermittently contaminated beach within sydney harbour australia whilst traditional fib methods indicated high levels of faecal contamination we used mst approaches to precisely identify the likely source of this contamination i e sewage vs animal our analysis demonstrated that rose bay is moderately impacted by dog and human faeces during dry weather both before and after the rainfall event but heavily impacted by human faeces sewage during wet weather after 3 8 mm and 43 mm rain additionally we identified the relative impact of individual stormwater drains on seawater quality by combining mst assays with dna sequencing techniques to trace the spatial and temporal dynamics of contamination this confirms that in cases where consistently high levels of fib are recorded by regular monitoring practises but the source of contamination remains ambiguous mst tools like those used here provide a powerful means for informing subsequent remediation and management efforts finally we identified the spatial and temporal dynamics of microbiological hazards associated with contamination including an increased occurrence of antibiotic resistance these more nuanced insights into the contributing factors to poor water quality at this highly urbanised coastal environment will inform efforts to resolve the causes of contamination and subsequently help to safeguard public health author contributions nathan l r williamsa nachshon sibonia
