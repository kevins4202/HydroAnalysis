3205,in cold boreal regions for rivers with small to medium sized watersheds under natural hydrological regimes the risk of spring flooding is determined by peak flow intensity rather than flood volume nonetheless short term forecasting of peak flow intensity is subject to a lot of uncertainty and depends largely on ongoing specific snowmelt conditions this study proposes a simple operational model based on the generalized additive model gam to forecast short term spring freshet peak flow the model uses hydrological and meteorological data publicly available on a daily basis the model was tested on five rivers in the province of québec canada with drainage basins varying between 350 km2 and 1707 km2 the model results forecasted peak flows were compared to those obtained using the generalized linear model glm and a distributed deterministic hydrological model hydrotel currently used for flow forecasting of several rivers in the province the peak flow was forecasted accurately with relatively few variables mainly a combination of river flow and rate of flow increase a few days before peak flow previous air temperature rain accumulation and snow accumulation nonetheless the best combinations of predictive variables were river specific the gam model using an automatic fitting and easily accessible daily data can be implemented by any stakeholder keywords peak flow flood forecast gam distributed hydrological model boreal hydrology spring runoff 1 introduction nearly one third of forested areas in the world are constituted of boreal forests gauthier et al 2015 the boreal area extends in large areas of canada scandinavia and russia and hydrological studies show similar traits in snowmelt runoff generated spring floods in all these regions woo et al 2008 in boreal climate watersheds receive mainly solid precipitation throughout the winter for most watersheds above a certain size snow accumulation generates the annual maximum floods during the spring freshet buttle et al 2016 with typical spring flood hydrographs foster et al 2018 for sweden the flood volume depends on snow water equivalent in the watershed and spring precipitations various procedures have been proposed to predict snowmelt ranging from snowmelt conceptual models using temperature index methods to advanced process based and multi layered energy budget models or hybrids between these approaches debele et al 2010 raleigh and lundquist 2012 bowling et al 2003 verdhen et al 2014 snowmelt models are coupled with runoff models for flow simulation massmann 2019 simple conceptual snowmelt runoff models based on temperature and volume balance simaityte et al 2008 wang and russell 2016 showed acceptable performance on mean flow and flood volume for large watersheds where snowmelt lasts longer and is therefore more predictable but the challenge remains peak flow estimation these models are therefore not suitable for small watersheds massmann 2019 although more elaborate physical and conceptual hydrological models have demonstrated good predictive capabilities for different flood situations they usually require various types of datasets and complex calibration fortin et al 1997 krauße et al 2012 agnihotri and coulibaly 2020 for example mac hbv and sac sma models require the determination of soil infiltration rate different soil water storages and depletion rates agnihotri and coulibaly 2020 their operational use is therefore generally restricted to large institutions for small to medium sized rivers that are vulnerable to flooding the value of peak flow intensity is in many instances more critical than the volume of the flood as peak flood duration varies from hours to a few days short term peak flow intensity forecasts are deemed very useful by managers however spring flood peak flow can be difficult to forecast peak flow intensity is indeed governed by the melting rate and rain input on melting snow barnhart et al 2016 snowmelt is itself an irregular process dependent on several hydro climatic factors that interact with each other including the ripening state of the snow cover and mainly temperature and precipitation li and simonovic 2002 these factors are specific to the current season and vary from year to year in the province of quebec a scientific commission on dam management nicolet 1997 making post hoc analysis of a major flood event recommended the implementation of a hydrological forecasting system as a preventive dam management tool for watersheds where management issues justify it currently the centre d expertise hydrique du québec cehq is prioritizing the use of a distributed deterministic hydrological model hydrotel turcotte et al 2004 for flood simulations and forecasting on new watersheds the hydrotel model produces continuous flow forecasts and is used for short term flood forecasts including snowmelt generated floods turcotte et al 2007 however the implementation calibration and operation of such a model requires a significant investment turcotte 2010 that is impossible for small municipalities or managers of hydraulic works and small dams to overcome the relatively demanding implementation of distributed hydrological models empirical approaches have gained in popularity among them are statistical or mathematical models using multiple linear regressions mlr girard et al 2004 adamowski et al 2012 generalized linear models glm nelder and wedderburn 1972 artificial neural networks ann latt and wittenberg 2014 maier and dandy 2000 sahoo and ray 2006 toukourou et al 2009 or combinations of them abdellatif et al 2013 mlr is a general linear model that assumes the relation between the dependant variable discharge or its logarithm and predictive physiological meteorological variables is linear which is most often ill adapted for such complex processes the glm generalizes linear regression by allowing the linear model to be related to the response variable via a link function and permitting the variance of each measurement to be a function of its predicted value with glm response variables can have error distribution models different from the normal distribution for instance binomial or poisson an extension to glm is the generalized additive model gam which relaxes the restriction that the relationship must be a simple weighted sum and assumes instead that the outcome can be modeled by a sum of arbitrary functions of predictors the core of a gam is still a sum of predictor effects but allows non linear relationships between the predictive variables and the response hastie and tibshirani 1986 glm was used in rainfall simulation yang et al 2005 george et al 2016 but more scarcely in flow simulation hofrichter et al 2006 the use of a non linear model is justified by the fact that hydrological processes are naturally non linear kundzewicz and napiorkowski 1986 latt and wittenberg 2014 for flood frequency analysis pandey and nguyen 1999 compared a variety of regional flood quantile estimation methods and found that non linear estimation methods outperformed the log linear model several non linear methods of regional flood quantile estimation have been proposed during the last decade see for instance durocher et al 2016 and ouali et al 2016 2017 desai and ouarda 2021 the gam model has been shown to be efficient for regional flood and low flow frequency analysis in the context of quebec s hydrology msilini et al 2022 ouarda et al 2018 this model has also been used successfully to predict water temperature with air temperature and river flow as input variables laanaya et al 2017 nonetheless to our knowledge gam has not yet been used for peak flood forecast the objective of the study is to present a simple and potentially operational model to forecast spring flood peak flow intensity on a short term one to three days for that the study aims to i highlight which are the main predictive variables for peak flow from an easily accessible set of data ii verify if the gam model is able to represent the relationship between peak flows and the selected predictors and compare its performance to the simple glm model iii apply the gam model for real time forecasting of peak flows on a daily time step and compare its performance to a distributed hydrological model hydrotel 2 case study and data 2 1 rivers meteorological and snow stations peak flood forecasts were evaluated on five rivers located in the boreal environment of the laurentian uplands of the canadian shield in the province of quebec canada fig 1 the rivers pikauba croche cyriac montmorency and malbaie were selected because they are under natural hydrological regimes and the five of them are gauged with hydrometric stations operated by the centre d expertise hydrique du québec cehq providing historical daily flow records from at least 1995 the drainage characteristics of the five hydrometric stations are given in table 1 the surface deposit of the five watersheds is largely composed of glacial till mrnf québec 2004 the upper section of the cyriac river valley is composed of organic deposits contrary to the other rivers and the malbaie river presents a steep sided valley with outcropping bedrock on most of its length the four rivers pikauba cyriac montmorency and malbaie take their source in the same mountainous region of the laurentide wildlife reserve réserve faunique des laurentides with their highest elevation being around 1050 m 1080 m the region receives the highest precipitation of the province with a mean of 1580 mm an snow 620 mm an the croche river watershed is located on lower land and receives a mean annual precipitation of 920 mm snow 250 mm an prairie climate centre 2021 melcc 2021a the five watersheds receive mainly solid precipitation snow in winter and no significant melting episode is experienced before the spring freshet the spring freshet is essentially due to snowmelt but can occasionally be affected by rain on snow events an example of the five rivers typical spring hydrographs is given in fig 2 for three of the studied rivers montmorency croche and malbaie rivers potential flooding has been identified as a major risk since they show vulnerable residential sectors melcc 2021b four meteorological and four snow stations located near or on the watersheds of the rivers under study were used for the analysis tables 2 and 3 fig 1 they have historical data from at least 1995 and are currently in operation the meteorological stations provide historical daily data of temperature precipitation rain and snow and degree day of heating the snow stations provide snow water equivalent swe measured sporadically during winter and more frequently a few weeks before the freshet the maximum snow water equivalent mswe measured corresponds to the total amount of water stored in the watershed before the melting starts this maximum value represents a point measure that can differ slightly from the actual maximum swe value one meteorological and one snow station were associated with each watershed after a correlation analysis with hydrometric data the maximum length of concomitant data between hydrometric meteorological and snow stations between 1995 and 2020 is given in table 6 for each river and is used in the analysis 2 2 potential predictive variables for spring freshet several potential predictors of the annual maximum daily spring flow were tested each of them a priori linked to snow quantities within the watershed and or to melting conditions the choice of variables was carried out based on previous experience with working with the rivers of the region data availability previous work with hydrological deterministic models and literature review all variables had to be easily accessible by non specialists and available in real time during the flood watch period minimum 24 h two types of variables were analysed those relating to the hydrograph characteristics the flow data table 4 and those related to climate and meteorological data table 5 the potential predictive data related to hydrograph characteristics were the start of melting the time between the start of melting and the peak the river flow and the rate of flow increase the rate of flow increase was used as an indicator of the melting rate which is unmonitored to keep the intuitive link to the physical processes the expression melting rate was used throughout the study instead of rate of flow increase the potential predictive climatic data were the mean temperature and rain few days before the peak flow monthly temperature and rain monthly degree day of heating 18c and maximum snow water equivalent in addition to these variables the mean monthly north atlantic oscillation nao index was considered as a potential predictor of peak flow indeed winter conditions in northeastern canada quebec and labrador are influenced by large scale atmospheric circulation and especially nao sveinsson et al 2008 for each year of the historical data the date and maximum peak flow of the spring freshet were known from the hydrometric stations it was thus possible to extract the potential predictive variables with different lead time before the peak flow to be able to assess a forecast at least 24 h before the flood peak real time climatic data were available at a daily time step except mswe and nao 3 methodology 3 1 generalized linear models glm the relationship between the peak flow and the different variables was firstly analysed using the generalized linear model glm as a baseline simple method for general linear models the residuals are assumed to be normally distributed if it is not the case it turns out that the relationship between a given response variable y and the model parameters is no longer linear however if the distribution of residuals is one from the exponential family such as binomial poisson negative binomial or gamma distributions there exists some function of mean of y which has linear relationship with model parameters this function is called link function in other words glm loosens the assumption of normality and allows a variety of other distributions given a response variable y and p predictive variables x 1 x 2 x p the glm model is written as follows 1 g e y β 0 β 1 x 1 β 2 x 2 β p x p where g is the parametric link function which allows for extension of the gaussian distribution to the exponential family and which connects the average of the dependent variable to a set of predictive variables β i i 1 p are the p coefficients to be estimated in the model and e y is the expected value of the response variable 3 2 generalized additive model gam given the non linearity of peak floods and predictive variables the generalized additive model gam was used to analyse the relationship between the daily peak flow of the spring freshet and the predictors gam is a nonparametric model and represents an extended version of the generalized linear model glm mccullagh and nelder 2019 this model replaces the linear predictor in glm with an additive one and can model the continuous data as a nonlinear smoothing function regression splines that can take a variety of forms dominici et al 2002 in this study the penalized cubic regression splines were used as smoothing functions to avoid overfitting by reducing the magnitude of the coefficients of the spline terms also referred to as penalized splines wood 2006 a gaussian distribution family is used for the response variable marra and wood 2011 as in this specific case the peak flow series distributions were not significantly different from the normal distribution for the five rivers this model is written as follows 2 g e y β 0 s 1 x 1 s 2 x 2 s p x p where the link function g is a function that links the dependant variable mean to a set of explanatory variables e y is the expectation of the dependent variable y daily peak flows x i are the predictive variables of the regression splines and β 0 is the intercept the implementation of this model requires the estimation of the smooth non linear functions s 1 x i i 1 p for each predictive variable x i gam requires the tuning of three main parameters i the basis dimension k which is the maximum possible number of degrees of freedom allowed for a smooth term in the model it allows gam to have great flexibility in curve fitting the generalized cross validation gcv was chosen as a smoothness selection method to assess k values pya and wood 2016 the obtained gcv score in gam can be used as the aic and smaller values indicate better fitting models wood 2017 k equals 3 or 4 in this study ii a form of smoothing splines in this case penalized cubic regression splines bs cr are used they are computationally efficient because they are defined using a basis of relatively modest size k wood 2017 in this procedure generalized cross validation gcv is used to automatically select the degree of smoothing the best model was then selected through the application of the explained deviance criterion the gcv score and the akaike information criterion aic akaike 1973 which provides a balance between the model fit and the number of parameters used and iii gamma which is a parameter generally used to increase the level of penalization when set above 1 by multiplying the effective degree of freedom in the gcv for the purpose of this study the value of 1 was used for gamma 3 3 distributed hydrological model hydrotel hydrotel is a physical process based distributed model that simulates river flow using different hydrological processes that is snow cover estimation evapotranspiration infiltration surface runoff and kinematic wave routing bouda et al 2014 turcotte et al 2007 fortin et al 2001 hydrological conditions prevailing on the watershed and weather forecasts temperature and precipitation are used as input and the model runs continuous simulations of flow 0 6 days at a 3 h time step hydrotel has been used for several years for short term flow forecasting in the province of quebec turcotte et al 2004 the model outputs have been available since 2016 for four of the five studied rivers for the croche river the hydrotel flood forecasts have been available only since 2020 for the present study the spring freshet peak flows forecasted by the hydrotel model were extracted from these output data provided by the cehq to assess the performance of the gam approach everyday a 6 day hydrograph at a 3 h time step is forecasted by hydrotel starting at 9 am the day of the forecast in order to compare results on the same time step than the gam model hydrotel outputs were averaged daily to transform 3 h peak flow values into daily peak flows the same basis of comparison an identical forecast lead time 24 h or 48 h was used for gam and hydrotel although the hydrotel model could provide a 6 day forecast for example for a 24 h forecast the hydrotel value was constituted of the mean daily flow forecasted for the next day of the prediction fig 3 the intent was not to evaluate the hydrotel model but to use its forecasted peak flow as a reference for gam model as its outputs are publicly available and are already in use for flood watch hence hydrotel was not calibrated and run specifically for the present study fore reference purposes the calibration process applied to the montmorency river was described in rousseau et al 2008 3 4 statistical models calibration and evaluation procedure a extraction of measured peak flows and potential predictive variables the annual maximum daily spring freshet peak flow and its date were extracted from the historical series of each river gauging station for each year of the historical record the potential predictive data were extracted some of the predictive variables were extracted at different delays from the peak date see tables 4 and 5 b pre selection of variables before implementing the statistical models a pre selection of variables was carried out by testing linear and rank correlation with the peak flow data and the swe some non significant variables a combination of low regression coefficient p value 0 05 and bad visual correlation with either flow or mswe were eliminated from the analysis the remaining pre selected variables were used for the following step of the selection c variables selection the selection of the different sets of predictive variables was assessed by a sensitivity analysis using a backward elimination the method consists in entering all the predictive variables then removing the ones with the lowest contribution to model accuracy based on the smallest value of the akaike information criterion aic the highest adjusted r2 and the highest explained deviance d martin and hall 2016 calculated as follows 3 aic 2 p 2 l n l h 4 adjusted r 2 1 1 r 2 n 1 n s 1 d 1 l l l l 0 5 where p is the number of model parameters and l h is the maximum value of the likelihood function of the model n is the total size sample number of year s is the number of predictors l is the maximum value of the likelihood function of the saturated model one free parameter per observation l is the maximum value for the likelihood of the fitted model and l 0 the maximum value of the likelihood function of the model with intercept only aic uses the parsimony principle it allows for the selection of the smallest set of predictive variables leading to the largest amount of variability to avoid complex model overfitting vandekerckhove et al 2015 boyce et al 2002 an eliminated variable that lead to reduction of the aic is considered as a non significant variable for gam or glm we assessed variable importance based on the f value and t value for gam and glm respectively wood 2013 d model calibration and performance evaluation the performance evaluation of statistical models was conducted using a leave one out cross validation loocv procedure on each year of the available periods since datasets are relatively small a loocv was preferred to other cross validation methods k fold split sample in the loocv method one data point one year is set apart from the n data of the dataset the statistical model is then applied to the remaining n 1 data for the automated parameter calibration the calibrated model is then run on the remaining year the procedure is conducted for all the years of the dataset the gam model performance was investigated in two steps first by comparing the forecasted peak flows with glm output on the full length of available maximum peak flow data then by comparing its performance to hydrotel used as a reference on the five years of data available for hydrotel output for each river the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 the relative root mean square error rrmse and relative bias rbias were used to compare the performances of the statistical models the closer to one the value of nse and the closer to zero the value of rrmse and rbias the better the performance of the model to assess the performance of the gam model in comparison to hydrotel model rrmse and rbias were calculated on the five available concomitant years given the low number of data nse was not used for the comparison with hydrotel as it is rather appropriate for continuous data the following equations were used 6 nse 1 i 1 n p i o i 2 i 1 n o o i 2 7 rrmse i 1 n p i o i 2 n o 8 rbias i 1 n p i o i n o where o is the observed daily peak flow o is the mean observed flow during n number of years i and pi is the i th predicted peak flow e real time operational model the applicability of the gam model was tested for real time forecasts with a day by day simulation as if the actual peak date was unknown simulations were conducted for the forecast of 2017 and 2018 spring freshet peak flow for pikauba river and 2018 peak flow for montmorency and cyriac rivers for each predictive variable the suitable lead time was previously selected on the historical series of peak flows for which we knew peak flow dates the proposed model is an adaptative model in which at each date a new forecast is produced based on the recent information the next day a new forecast is produced on adapted information for example for operational use in real time at day d we can extract the two day delay river flow q 2 at d 1 to predict the peak flow at d 1 and go on to the next day for each river the model was calibrated on the previous years dataset that is the model is not recalibrated on a daily basis during the flood season as the model is built only on annual maximum daily peak flow values it can only be recalibrated at the end of the spring flood season when the maximum flow value is known for the current season it is hence important to wait until the end of the spring flood season before retraining the model open source packages all programming was done using r software implementation of gam and glm was carried under mgcv package wood 2006 and stats package r core team 2020 respectively 4 results 4 1 peak flow forecast with statistical models glm and gam 4 1 1 significant predictive variables the meteorological station and the snow station showing the best correlation with hydrometric data were associated with each watershed table 6 l étape meteorological station was associated with four rivers i e the pikauba cyriac montmorency and malbaie rivers the roberval station was associated with the croche river three snow stations have been selected chicoutimi kiskissink and la galette as a first step linear and rank correlations with flow data and swe showed that the following variables were not significantly correlated for any rivers and were discarded the start of the melting date delay from the peak and monthly rainfall accumulation for monthly temperature and nao only the mean temperature of march and april were weakly correlated with the peak flows and the mean nao of march or april were weakly correlated with the swe of some rivers and were retained all other variables were retained to be tested with the statistical models table s1 in supp data as a second step from these datasets the combination of variables giving the lowest aic was found to be different amongst the rivers however the following variables were overall significant to predict the freshet peak flow with both statistical models glm and gam for the five studied rivers with some specificities with their duration and delay from the peak table 6 maximum snow cover water equivalent melting rate a few days before the flood peak daily river flow a few days before the flood peak mean air temperature a few days before the flood peak april or march mean air temperature rainfall accumulation a few days before the flood peak with the gam model five predictive variables were selected for the pikauba montmorency and malbaie rivers and only four predictors were selected for the croche and cyriac rivers the results of gam fitting on the predictive variables of the pikauba river are illustrated in fig 4 as an example see supp data for the fitting to other rivers the melting rate and the antecedent river flow were significant predictive variables for the five rivers with gam and glm model and showed a positive correlation with the peak flow the only difference between rivers was the duration of significant period to consider before flood peak the mswe on the watershed was also significant for the five rivers with gam but not for montmorency and malbaie rivers for glm this variable globally showed a weak positive correlation with peak flow mean air temperature measured a few days before the flood peak was a significant predictive variable for most rivers it is negatively correlated to peak flow intensity the significance of monthly temperature for march or april depended on the models and the rivers it was significant for the pikauba cyriac and montmorency rivers rainfall accumulation a few days before the flood peak was a significant predictive variable for the cyriac montmorency and malbaie rivers but not for the pikauba and croche rivers the cumulative impact of rainfall and temperature on river flow can be observed on the hydrographs of the 2018 freshet fig 2 several flow peaks were noticeable for the cyriac montmorency and malbaie rivers while fewer peaks were observable for the pikauba river and croche river nao was not selected as a predictive variable for any river the relative importance of the predictive variables varies from one river to another but the melting rate and the antecedent river flow were among the most important variables to forecast peak flow supp data table s2 the relative importance of rain and temperature was highly variable among the rivers and with the models swe was generally the least important predictive variable the forecast lead time was determined by the smaller delay of the selected set of variables for the four rivers pikauba cyriac montmorency and malbaie there had to be a 1 day delay variable in the predictive set to be significant usually the melting rate this meant that the rivers peak flow could only be forecasted at a 24 h lead time for the croche river it was possible to use the melting rate with a 1 day or a 2 day delay meaning that the peak flow could be forecasted with a 48 h and a 24 h lead time table 6 with the selected variables on a 24 h forecast the adjusted r2 and the deviance showed the highest values with gam for the pikauba croche cyriac and montmorency rivers adjusted r2 values ranged between 0 81 and 0 97 and deviance values were between 88 7 and 98 3 table 6 the results of the fitting on the malbaie river were weaker of the five rivers with a r2 value of 0 74 and an explained deviance of 79 7 the glm models showed lower adjusted r2 and deviance than gam models for the five rivers with especially low values on cyriac and montmorency rivers 4 1 2 peak flow forecasts with glm and gam model the results of gam forecasted flow compared to the measured spring freshet peak flows are illustrated in fig 5 the relative rmse varied between 18 6 and 7 3 for gam models and between 23 5 and 21 1 for the glm models table 6 for three rivers gam exhibited lower rrmse and rbias than glm and similar values for the malbaie river nse values varied from 0 59 to 0 93 for gam and from 0 47 to 0 81 for glm gam showed higher nse values than glm for three rivers the croche cyriac and montmorency rivers close values for the pikauba and identical values for the malbaie river for which variables showed a linear relationship with peak flow fig s5 supp data bias remained low for both models with the largest value of 2 6 for a 48 h forecast on the croche river with gam and 2 1 on the cyriac river with glm the gam model performance showed an improvement with the decrease of forecast lead time for the croche river with a rrmse of 21 3 for 48 h and 7 3 for 24 h based on the relative rmse relative bias and nse the gam model can be concluded to lead to a better performance than the glm model for the prediction of the annual freshet peak flow 4 2 comparison of peak flow forecast between gam and distributed model hydrotel the peak flows forecasted by the gam model were compared with the results of the hydrotel model from 2016 to 2020 using the same forecast lead time 24 h or 48 h table 7 for the four rivers with enough data to allow comparison gam model exhibited a lower relative rmse than hydrotel model with values ranging from 5 7 to 14 1 for gam and from 11 4 to 39 5 for hydrotel relative bias was lower for the gam model than for hydrotel for two of the four rivers no systematic bias was observed for the 24 h forecast of either model 4 3 real time peak flow forecast evaluation of gam and hydrotel real time peak flow forecast simulations were conducted with the gam model and were compared to hydrotel 24 h forecast fig 6 to allow for comparison figures show the measured river flows and the forecasted peak flows for the same dates on a daily time step and a 24 h lead time for both models the gam model allowed for a good forecast of the peak flow within 24 to 48 h the hydrotel model 24 h forecasts showed more variability on day to day basis than gam model forecasts as gam model was fitted on previous flood peaks only it showed higher flow than observed before the flood peak itself since the statistical model considers previous catchment conditions and not weather forecast it was not able to predict the recession following the peak therefore the model overestimated the flow rates once the actual peak had passed the overall maximum flood peak forecasted by hydrotel regardless of the lead time tended to converge towards the actual peak as the lead time to the actual peak flood decreased however hydrotel showed important daily variability and tended to highly overestimate the actual flood with a forecast horizon of 3 to 5 days before the peak 5 discussion 5 1 contextualization of the significant predictive variables for peak flow the selection of the significant variables was based on statistical model performance for each river while accounting for parsimony regarding the number of explicative variables in comparison to process based hydrological models flood peak could be forecasted from a pool of six variables the best combinations of predictive variables including the appropriate delay from the peak were river specific and were dependent on the hydrological context of the watersheds however the main significant variables for the forecast of peak flow are likely generalizable given the similarity in the physical processes of snowmelt runoff in forested watershed this is similar to the way temperature index snowmelt models using river flow can be applied successfully in several watershed configurations massmann 2019 the exact combination of variables and their relevant lag from peak flow must be set for each watershed 5 1 1 maximum snow water equivalent the mswe was among the significant predictive variables for the five rivers however although this variable is highly correlated with the total volume of the spring hydrograph which was not forecasted in the present study the mswe was one of the least important variables to forecast the peak flow table s2 supp data indeed a late spring snowstorm can generate a high water equivalent but this fresh snow might take time to ripen and for a given volume slower melting leads to a smaller flood peak than faster melting of a ripe snowpack this was observed for the montmorency and malbaie rivers which showed the highest elevation difference from the head of the basin to the outlet leading to a delayed melting of the upper part covered with fresher snow accentuated when rivers are flowing from north to south woo et al 2008 furthermore as meteorological variables are driving the melting process they modulate the influence of the amount of snow li and simonovic 2002 the peak flow intensity is strongly influenced by the meteorological conditions prevailing a few days before the peak rather than directly by the quantity of snow accumulation on the watershed hence for small or medium size watersheds the mswe is an indicator of the incoming peak flow but does not govern the peak flow intensity 5 1 2 previous river flow and melting rate as river flow is autocorrelated integration of the river flow and the rate of increase of the flow hydrograph proxy for melting rate for the few previous days improved significantly the peak flow forecast for the five rivers it was observed for most rivers that river flow and melting rate were significant for several delays for example 1 and 2 days before the peak in the present study only one delay was selected for each variable future work should consider the use of several significant delays for the same variable type when this variable is of importance as was done in fernando and jayawardena 1998 consequently some other variables of lesser importance should be removed to avoid overfitting the combination of an autoregressive flow model with a deterministic hydrological model was shown to bring efficient improvement in flood peak prediction arheimer et al 2011 5 1 3 air temperature air temperature triggers the melting process as it can be observed in fig 2 where the flood hydrograph starts with the positive mean air temperature this illustrates well why temperature based or degree day models can be useful for snowmelt evaluation agnihotri and coulibaly 2020 massmann 2019 in the present study where focus is on peak flow the impact of air temperature was river specific the correlation was positive for the pikauba and malbaie rivers and negative for the croche and montmorency rivers it can be hypothesised that the meteorological station l étape located at an elevation of 791 m was representative of the air temperature for the pikauba and the upper part of the malbaie watersheds located on high elevations and showing respectively north west and north east orientations on the other hand as the montmorency watershed shows a south orientation the actual mean air temperature might be higher than the recorded temperature at l étape and the melting starts earlier leading to a lower melting rate barnhart et al 2016 hence the station high temperature was likely associated to late peak flows when the melting is already advanced and the peak intensity is susceptible to be lower the same explanation might apply for the croche river and the roberval station which is at a low elevation but located at nearly a 100 km north of the watershed centroid furthermore the runoff and infiltration processes have been shown to be distinct for different slope orientation possibly linked to the difference in vegetation buttle et al 2000 with the gam model the peak flows of three of the rivers were better predicted with a 5 day mean temperature whereas for two rivers croche and malbaie it was the 3 day mean temperature that was the most efficient this result seems counter intuitive as these two rivers have the largest catchment areas watershed configuration and distance between the watershed and the meteorological station might explain this difference the monthly temperatures of march and april influence both snow accumulation and the ripening state of the snow cover for example for the pikauba river for which the mean date of flood peak is may 13th the correlation was negative between the temperature in april and the peak flow indeed in april the mean temperature can be positive implying that the melting of the snow cover has already started a colder april temperature means better preserved snow cover and fewer early partial melting events on this relatively high elevation watershed on the other hand for the cyriac river the relationship was positive with the temperature in march the temperatures in march are colder than those in april and remain negative henceforth a warmer temperature in march means more snowfall while a colder temperature means less snowfall davis et al 1999 5 1 4 previous rainfall rainfall accumulation preceding the peak flow was not a predictive variable for the pikauba and croche rivers for the pikauba river the flood wave is attenuated by the many head lakes of the watershed the croche river watershed which also has a head lake shows in addition the lowest slope of the five rivers and the river is significantly meandering in a large valley allowing attenuation of rainfall runoff the impact of rainfall on the watershed is specific to the watershed configuration furthermore rainfall can represent local events and although the stations showing the best correlation with the flow data were selected the stations were located outside the watersheds that is especially the case for the croche the cyriac and the malbaie rivers which may imply that some rainfall events could have been missed adding regional information by aggregating the meteorological and snow data from other stations could significantly improve flow results as shown by vaze et al 2011 with lumped datasets while still keeping the same accessible data sources and a simple methodology however as boreal regions are globally low populated areas data can be limited 5 1 5 north atlantic oscillation nao was not a predictor of peak flow the monthly nao index was not a significant predictor for peak flow for any of the five rivers although march and april nao were slightly correlated with swe this result supports the findings of mazouz et al 2013 who showed that seasonal nao and atlantic multi decadal oscillation mao were correlated to some flood characteristics duration timing frequency and variation but not peak magnitude for rivers in quebec with similar watershed sizes the relatively small catchment area and short duration of spring flood of the studied rivers might explain why the monthly nao index was not a direct predictive factor of the short term peak flow although it might influence water equivalent of snow cover nevertheless march and april nao were slightly correlated with swe it would be relevant to test also monthly mao or monthly arctic oscillation ao which is related to nao thiombiano et al 2017 for peak flow forecasting or for other flood characteristics 5 2 statistical models successfully predicted daily peak flow both statistical models glm and gam were able to forecast the maximum peak flow from few hydrological variables as expected because of the non linearity of predictive variables gam lead to a better performance than glm the relative rmse value obtained for the gam model equal or below 18 6 and nse between 0 59 and 0 93 compared favorably with the results of other hydrological models for peak flow forecasting see for instance westrick et al 2002 mean error of 31 for the most accurate peak flow forecasts agnihotri and coulibaly 2020 mean nse varying between 0 55 and 0 70 for the most accurate models or vaze et al 2011 67 of nse higher than 0 5 on peak flow forecast with a single meteorological station although the proposed statistical model assumes that daily values of temperature and precipitation from one meteorological station are representative of the condition of the entire watershed and despite the range of watershed sizes of the tested rivers factor 5 the gam model was well suited for the five rivers a higher relative rmse was found for the cyriac river which has also the smallest watershed area and might show more variability testing the model on a wider range of watershed size would allow to assess if there is an optimal range of use during the pre selection process it was noted that linear and rank correlations can be non significant for variables that are significant for the gam model due to the non linearity of the relationships between peak flow and the predictive variables linear and rank correlations should be used cautiously to discard variables and the selection should mainly be done using gam nonetheless as our datasets were relatively small there was a risk of overfitting the data hence for more robust models users should take advantage of reassessing the variables selection and recalibrate the model after a few years of use when more data are available the normal distribution was adopted in the present work because it provides a good fit to the station data and avoids the complexity of other models however the glm and gam models can be applied with other distributions normality is not a limiting factor for their application future work should adopt other distributions with different data sets to demonstrate and evaluate the generality of the proposed methodology 5 3 comparison of gam model with distributed model hydrotel limitations and perspectives the gam statistical model showed smaller rrmse and bias than hydrotel for a 24 h forecast specifically conducted on peak flow this was partly expected as hydrotel was not designed to provide short term flood peak forecast but rather to provide a predicted hydrograph and a longer term forecast than gam including a confidence level which is useful for decision makers hydrotel is calibrated to minimize the error between observed and simulated flow all year long which can generate bias on the prediction of extreme events farmer and vogel 2016 in contrast the gam model was specifically adjusted on spring maximum peak flow this brings a limitation of its use as the model is calibrated only to forecast peak flow it should be used only during the spring freshet when the melting has already started and as long as a qualitatively significant snow cover remains on the watershed which requires human observations it applies on rivers where there is a risk of flooding and where there is a known flow threshold for which an emergency plan must be launched decisions about a possible intervention have to be taken regarding the current hydrological conditions in addition to the model and calibrated in regard to false alarms hence a more extensive testing of day to day forecasts should be conducted to assess the predicted variability for a given flood or the probability of having a false alarm the real time testing though seems to show a stability in the prediction fig 6 and results on historical data for the tested rivers showed few highly overestimated peak flows fig 5 the comparison of the real time forecasts at the same time step showed that the gam model could be used advantageously especially in basins for which no deterministic hydrologic model is implemented the gam model gave a realistic order of magnitude of the upcoming flood although forecast is done for a short term period of 24 h or 48 h it can be used as a decision support to launch emergency measures peak flow intensity was overestimated by hydrotel for 3 to 5 day lead time possibly due to the use of weather forecasts as inputs which are still imprecise beyond three days although it could be argued that overestimating the flood brings a safety factor by triggering a flood watch when time comes to implement emergency measures the systematic positive bias can represent significant costs and inconveniences such as some emergency structural reinforcement the installation of temporary dikes or the evacuation of residences this systematic bias can also lead managers to get used to having lesser than expected floods and to take a passive attitude towards the flood to come future work could focus on the integration of meteorological forecasts in the gam model which might lead to the increase of the forecasting lead time which was rather short for the selected rivers in that case the forecast data of the global environmental multiscale model gem from the canadian meteorological centre mailhot et al 2006 should be used and might require complex data processing that would derogate from the more simple approach proposed herein the current gam model was dedicated to only forecast the peak flow and it does not simulate the whole hydrograph including the flow recession the model is based on the growth of the hydrograph and the antecedent flow which only increases as the flood peak approaches thus the present forecasting model must be accompanied by a subjective observation of the weather forecast and an observation of the water level to assess the recession phase it could be interesting to verify whether the addition of auto regressive flow or the volume runoff since the onset of snowmelt could make it possible to determine the recession phase and thus avoid overestimating the flow after the actual peak in its current form the model still requires human interpretation using the neighboring rivers to forecast the peak timing as the spring freshet is often synchronized in a region with delays between rivers known by local stakeholders an identical approach with gam model should be tested in future work for the forecast of the peak timing using similar predictive variables and auto regressive flow and rain bidwell and griffiths 1994 climate indices mazouz et al 2013 and or the cumulative flood volume already passed coupled to mswe for smaller watersheds higher frequency forecast could be obtained by using the hourly flow available at hydrometric stations however hourly air temperature data are not easily available and diurnal air temperature is highly variable in spring 6 conclusion the objective of this study was to implement an operational model to forecast spring flood peak flow for medium sized watersheds from easily accessible data and with minimal manipulation the model forecasts had to be reliable so they could be used to make decisions on triggering emergency measures for rivers vulnerable to flooding peak flow intensity can be assessed with few watershed characteristics and meteorological data the two statistical models tested glm and gam had the capacity to take into account the different predictive variables given the non linearity of hydrological phenomena the gam model moderately more complex than glm was better suited to forecast the peak flow this statistical model based on the current hydrograph characteristics and past weather conditions provided a good short term peak flow forecast the value of the expected discharge for 24 h lead time compared favorably with the distributed model hydrotel used as a reference the gam model was well suited to the whole range of medium sized watersheds tested the datasets used in the present study are relatively short the model would hence gain from being re calibrated after a few years by adding the more recent spring flood data of the studied rivers all variables used are accessible via the internet within a 24 h notice allowing forecasting at this minimum time step the best set of predictive variables is specific to each river however its selection can be automated and remains much simpler than implementing a more complex hydrological model the relatively simple implementation of gam makes it attractive when a more complex hydrological model is not already implemented and it makes it useable by any stakeholder during flood watch to help decision making although the distributed model hydrotel was also implemented on each studied watershed the gam model forecasts can be a complementary tool for emergency planning as they show less variability then hydrotel forecasts in the present study the flow value and rate of increase of the hydrograph were used as predictive variables as peak flow is auto correlated to river flow and all the rivers were gauged future efforts should be dedicated to use neighboring or comparable gauged river flow as an input variable instead of the same river flow as it is frequently done for flood quantile estimation at ungauged basin ouarda et al 2000 melcc 2021c with this extension the model could allow forecasting peak flows at ungauged rivers and would be even more relevant as shown by arheimer et al 2011 the model performance would benefit from any improvements in the different elements on the chain data source with the integration of multiple meteorological stations variable selectivity including auto regressive data and a more extensive testing of real time forecasts the proposed model does not allow to forecast peak timing and flow recession but the use of the gam model to forecast peak timing is an avenue for future work future work should also focus on quantifying the real advantages of using more complex models such as gam and the trade off between reduced bias and increased estimation variance associate to over parameterization future research efforts may also focus on the comparison of the gam model to other commonly used forecasting approaches such as the non parametric k nearest neighbor k nn model and explore daily and or hourly time series approach since there can be lags of unknown duration between important peak flow events in a time series recurrent neural networks rnn and more specifically long short term memory lstm which is an optimization of rnn that was shown to be well suited for making prediction based on time series data xu et al 2020 the combination of models using neural networks could be explored to obtain forecasts for different time horizons tsakiri et al 2018 the emerging functional data analysis fda approach could be applied to the same basins studied in the present work fda has been shown in recent studies to lead to reliable forecasts for a number of hydro climatic variables see for instance

3205,in cold boreal regions for rivers with small to medium sized watersheds under natural hydrological regimes the risk of spring flooding is determined by peak flow intensity rather than flood volume nonetheless short term forecasting of peak flow intensity is subject to a lot of uncertainty and depends largely on ongoing specific snowmelt conditions this study proposes a simple operational model based on the generalized additive model gam to forecast short term spring freshet peak flow the model uses hydrological and meteorological data publicly available on a daily basis the model was tested on five rivers in the province of québec canada with drainage basins varying between 350 km2 and 1707 km2 the model results forecasted peak flows were compared to those obtained using the generalized linear model glm and a distributed deterministic hydrological model hydrotel currently used for flow forecasting of several rivers in the province the peak flow was forecasted accurately with relatively few variables mainly a combination of river flow and rate of flow increase a few days before peak flow previous air temperature rain accumulation and snow accumulation nonetheless the best combinations of predictive variables were river specific the gam model using an automatic fitting and easily accessible daily data can be implemented by any stakeholder keywords peak flow flood forecast gam distributed hydrological model boreal hydrology spring runoff 1 introduction nearly one third of forested areas in the world are constituted of boreal forests gauthier et al 2015 the boreal area extends in large areas of canada scandinavia and russia and hydrological studies show similar traits in snowmelt runoff generated spring floods in all these regions woo et al 2008 in boreal climate watersheds receive mainly solid precipitation throughout the winter for most watersheds above a certain size snow accumulation generates the annual maximum floods during the spring freshet buttle et al 2016 with typical spring flood hydrographs foster et al 2018 for sweden the flood volume depends on snow water equivalent in the watershed and spring precipitations various procedures have been proposed to predict snowmelt ranging from snowmelt conceptual models using temperature index methods to advanced process based and multi layered energy budget models or hybrids between these approaches debele et al 2010 raleigh and lundquist 2012 bowling et al 2003 verdhen et al 2014 snowmelt models are coupled with runoff models for flow simulation massmann 2019 simple conceptual snowmelt runoff models based on temperature and volume balance simaityte et al 2008 wang and russell 2016 showed acceptable performance on mean flow and flood volume for large watersheds where snowmelt lasts longer and is therefore more predictable but the challenge remains peak flow estimation these models are therefore not suitable for small watersheds massmann 2019 although more elaborate physical and conceptual hydrological models have demonstrated good predictive capabilities for different flood situations they usually require various types of datasets and complex calibration fortin et al 1997 krauße et al 2012 agnihotri and coulibaly 2020 for example mac hbv and sac sma models require the determination of soil infiltration rate different soil water storages and depletion rates agnihotri and coulibaly 2020 their operational use is therefore generally restricted to large institutions for small to medium sized rivers that are vulnerable to flooding the value of peak flow intensity is in many instances more critical than the volume of the flood as peak flood duration varies from hours to a few days short term peak flow intensity forecasts are deemed very useful by managers however spring flood peak flow can be difficult to forecast peak flow intensity is indeed governed by the melting rate and rain input on melting snow barnhart et al 2016 snowmelt is itself an irregular process dependent on several hydro climatic factors that interact with each other including the ripening state of the snow cover and mainly temperature and precipitation li and simonovic 2002 these factors are specific to the current season and vary from year to year in the province of quebec a scientific commission on dam management nicolet 1997 making post hoc analysis of a major flood event recommended the implementation of a hydrological forecasting system as a preventive dam management tool for watersheds where management issues justify it currently the centre d expertise hydrique du québec cehq is prioritizing the use of a distributed deterministic hydrological model hydrotel turcotte et al 2004 for flood simulations and forecasting on new watersheds the hydrotel model produces continuous flow forecasts and is used for short term flood forecasts including snowmelt generated floods turcotte et al 2007 however the implementation calibration and operation of such a model requires a significant investment turcotte 2010 that is impossible for small municipalities or managers of hydraulic works and small dams to overcome the relatively demanding implementation of distributed hydrological models empirical approaches have gained in popularity among them are statistical or mathematical models using multiple linear regressions mlr girard et al 2004 adamowski et al 2012 generalized linear models glm nelder and wedderburn 1972 artificial neural networks ann latt and wittenberg 2014 maier and dandy 2000 sahoo and ray 2006 toukourou et al 2009 or combinations of them abdellatif et al 2013 mlr is a general linear model that assumes the relation between the dependant variable discharge or its logarithm and predictive physiological meteorological variables is linear which is most often ill adapted for such complex processes the glm generalizes linear regression by allowing the linear model to be related to the response variable via a link function and permitting the variance of each measurement to be a function of its predicted value with glm response variables can have error distribution models different from the normal distribution for instance binomial or poisson an extension to glm is the generalized additive model gam which relaxes the restriction that the relationship must be a simple weighted sum and assumes instead that the outcome can be modeled by a sum of arbitrary functions of predictors the core of a gam is still a sum of predictor effects but allows non linear relationships between the predictive variables and the response hastie and tibshirani 1986 glm was used in rainfall simulation yang et al 2005 george et al 2016 but more scarcely in flow simulation hofrichter et al 2006 the use of a non linear model is justified by the fact that hydrological processes are naturally non linear kundzewicz and napiorkowski 1986 latt and wittenberg 2014 for flood frequency analysis pandey and nguyen 1999 compared a variety of regional flood quantile estimation methods and found that non linear estimation methods outperformed the log linear model several non linear methods of regional flood quantile estimation have been proposed during the last decade see for instance durocher et al 2016 and ouali et al 2016 2017 desai and ouarda 2021 the gam model has been shown to be efficient for regional flood and low flow frequency analysis in the context of quebec s hydrology msilini et al 2022 ouarda et al 2018 this model has also been used successfully to predict water temperature with air temperature and river flow as input variables laanaya et al 2017 nonetheless to our knowledge gam has not yet been used for peak flood forecast the objective of the study is to present a simple and potentially operational model to forecast spring flood peak flow intensity on a short term one to three days for that the study aims to i highlight which are the main predictive variables for peak flow from an easily accessible set of data ii verify if the gam model is able to represent the relationship between peak flows and the selected predictors and compare its performance to the simple glm model iii apply the gam model for real time forecasting of peak flows on a daily time step and compare its performance to a distributed hydrological model hydrotel 2 case study and data 2 1 rivers meteorological and snow stations peak flood forecasts were evaluated on five rivers located in the boreal environment of the laurentian uplands of the canadian shield in the province of quebec canada fig 1 the rivers pikauba croche cyriac montmorency and malbaie were selected because they are under natural hydrological regimes and the five of them are gauged with hydrometric stations operated by the centre d expertise hydrique du québec cehq providing historical daily flow records from at least 1995 the drainage characteristics of the five hydrometric stations are given in table 1 the surface deposit of the five watersheds is largely composed of glacial till mrnf québec 2004 the upper section of the cyriac river valley is composed of organic deposits contrary to the other rivers and the malbaie river presents a steep sided valley with outcropping bedrock on most of its length the four rivers pikauba cyriac montmorency and malbaie take their source in the same mountainous region of the laurentide wildlife reserve réserve faunique des laurentides with their highest elevation being around 1050 m 1080 m the region receives the highest precipitation of the province with a mean of 1580 mm an snow 620 mm an the croche river watershed is located on lower land and receives a mean annual precipitation of 920 mm snow 250 mm an prairie climate centre 2021 melcc 2021a the five watersheds receive mainly solid precipitation snow in winter and no significant melting episode is experienced before the spring freshet the spring freshet is essentially due to snowmelt but can occasionally be affected by rain on snow events an example of the five rivers typical spring hydrographs is given in fig 2 for three of the studied rivers montmorency croche and malbaie rivers potential flooding has been identified as a major risk since they show vulnerable residential sectors melcc 2021b four meteorological and four snow stations located near or on the watersheds of the rivers under study were used for the analysis tables 2 and 3 fig 1 they have historical data from at least 1995 and are currently in operation the meteorological stations provide historical daily data of temperature precipitation rain and snow and degree day of heating the snow stations provide snow water equivalent swe measured sporadically during winter and more frequently a few weeks before the freshet the maximum snow water equivalent mswe measured corresponds to the total amount of water stored in the watershed before the melting starts this maximum value represents a point measure that can differ slightly from the actual maximum swe value one meteorological and one snow station were associated with each watershed after a correlation analysis with hydrometric data the maximum length of concomitant data between hydrometric meteorological and snow stations between 1995 and 2020 is given in table 6 for each river and is used in the analysis 2 2 potential predictive variables for spring freshet several potential predictors of the annual maximum daily spring flow were tested each of them a priori linked to snow quantities within the watershed and or to melting conditions the choice of variables was carried out based on previous experience with working with the rivers of the region data availability previous work with hydrological deterministic models and literature review all variables had to be easily accessible by non specialists and available in real time during the flood watch period minimum 24 h two types of variables were analysed those relating to the hydrograph characteristics the flow data table 4 and those related to climate and meteorological data table 5 the potential predictive data related to hydrograph characteristics were the start of melting the time between the start of melting and the peak the river flow and the rate of flow increase the rate of flow increase was used as an indicator of the melting rate which is unmonitored to keep the intuitive link to the physical processes the expression melting rate was used throughout the study instead of rate of flow increase the potential predictive climatic data were the mean temperature and rain few days before the peak flow monthly temperature and rain monthly degree day of heating 18c and maximum snow water equivalent in addition to these variables the mean monthly north atlantic oscillation nao index was considered as a potential predictor of peak flow indeed winter conditions in northeastern canada quebec and labrador are influenced by large scale atmospheric circulation and especially nao sveinsson et al 2008 for each year of the historical data the date and maximum peak flow of the spring freshet were known from the hydrometric stations it was thus possible to extract the potential predictive variables with different lead time before the peak flow to be able to assess a forecast at least 24 h before the flood peak real time climatic data were available at a daily time step except mswe and nao 3 methodology 3 1 generalized linear models glm the relationship between the peak flow and the different variables was firstly analysed using the generalized linear model glm as a baseline simple method for general linear models the residuals are assumed to be normally distributed if it is not the case it turns out that the relationship between a given response variable y and the model parameters is no longer linear however if the distribution of residuals is one from the exponential family such as binomial poisson negative binomial or gamma distributions there exists some function of mean of y which has linear relationship with model parameters this function is called link function in other words glm loosens the assumption of normality and allows a variety of other distributions given a response variable y and p predictive variables x 1 x 2 x p the glm model is written as follows 1 g e y β 0 β 1 x 1 β 2 x 2 β p x p where g is the parametric link function which allows for extension of the gaussian distribution to the exponential family and which connects the average of the dependent variable to a set of predictive variables β i i 1 p are the p coefficients to be estimated in the model and e y is the expected value of the response variable 3 2 generalized additive model gam given the non linearity of peak floods and predictive variables the generalized additive model gam was used to analyse the relationship between the daily peak flow of the spring freshet and the predictors gam is a nonparametric model and represents an extended version of the generalized linear model glm mccullagh and nelder 2019 this model replaces the linear predictor in glm with an additive one and can model the continuous data as a nonlinear smoothing function regression splines that can take a variety of forms dominici et al 2002 in this study the penalized cubic regression splines were used as smoothing functions to avoid overfitting by reducing the magnitude of the coefficients of the spline terms also referred to as penalized splines wood 2006 a gaussian distribution family is used for the response variable marra and wood 2011 as in this specific case the peak flow series distributions were not significantly different from the normal distribution for the five rivers this model is written as follows 2 g e y β 0 s 1 x 1 s 2 x 2 s p x p where the link function g is a function that links the dependant variable mean to a set of explanatory variables e y is the expectation of the dependent variable y daily peak flows x i are the predictive variables of the regression splines and β 0 is the intercept the implementation of this model requires the estimation of the smooth non linear functions s 1 x i i 1 p for each predictive variable x i gam requires the tuning of three main parameters i the basis dimension k which is the maximum possible number of degrees of freedom allowed for a smooth term in the model it allows gam to have great flexibility in curve fitting the generalized cross validation gcv was chosen as a smoothness selection method to assess k values pya and wood 2016 the obtained gcv score in gam can be used as the aic and smaller values indicate better fitting models wood 2017 k equals 3 or 4 in this study ii a form of smoothing splines in this case penalized cubic regression splines bs cr are used they are computationally efficient because they are defined using a basis of relatively modest size k wood 2017 in this procedure generalized cross validation gcv is used to automatically select the degree of smoothing the best model was then selected through the application of the explained deviance criterion the gcv score and the akaike information criterion aic akaike 1973 which provides a balance between the model fit and the number of parameters used and iii gamma which is a parameter generally used to increase the level of penalization when set above 1 by multiplying the effective degree of freedom in the gcv for the purpose of this study the value of 1 was used for gamma 3 3 distributed hydrological model hydrotel hydrotel is a physical process based distributed model that simulates river flow using different hydrological processes that is snow cover estimation evapotranspiration infiltration surface runoff and kinematic wave routing bouda et al 2014 turcotte et al 2007 fortin et al 2001 hydrological conditions prevailing on the watershed and weather forecasts temperature and precipitation are used as input and the model runs continuous simulations of flow 0 6 days at a 3 h time step hydrotel has been used for several years for short term flow forecasting in the province of quebec turcotte et al 2004 the model outputs have been available since 2016 for four of the five studied rivers for the croche river the hydrotel flood forecasts have been available only since 2020 for the present study the spring freshet peak flows forecasted by the hydrotel model were extracted from these output data provided by the cehq to assess the performance of the gam approach everyday a 6 day hydrograph at a 3 h time step is forecasted by hydrotel starting at 9 am the day of the forecast in order to compare results on the same time step than the gam model hydrotel outputs were averaged daily to transform 3 h peak flow values into daily peak flows the same basis of comparison an identical forecast lead time 24 h or 48 h was used for gam and hydrotel although the hydrotel model could provide a 6 day forecast for example for a 24 h forecast the hydrotel value was constituted of the mean daily flow forecasted for the next day of the prediction fig 3 the intent was not to evaluate the hydrotel model but to use its forecasted peak flow as a reference for gam model as its outputs are publicly available and are already in use for flood watch hence hydrotel was not calibrated and run specifically for the present study fore reference purposes the calibration process applied to the montmorency river was described in rousseau et al 2008 3 4 statistical models calibration and evaluation procedure a extraction of measured peak flows and potential predictive variables the annual maximum daily spring freshet peak flow and its date were extracted from the historical series of each river gauging station for each year of the historical record the potential predictive data were extracted some of the predictive variables were extracted at different delays from the peak date see tables 4 and 5 b pre selection of variables before implementing the statistical models a pre selection of variables was carried out by testing linear and rank correlation with the peak flow data and the swe some non significant variables a combination of low regression coefficient p value 0 05 and bad visual correlation with either flow or mswe were eliminated from the analysis the remaining pre selected variables were used for the following step of the selection c variables selection the selection of the different sets of predictive variables was assessed by a sensitivity analysis using a backward elimination the method consists in entering all the predictive variables then removing the ones with the lowest contribution to model accuracy based on the smallest value of the akaike information criterion aic the highest adjusted r2 and the highest explained deviance d martin and hall 2016 calculated as follows 3 aic 2 p 2 l n l h 4 adjusted r 2 1 1 r 2 n 1 n s 1 d 1 l l l l 0 5 where p is the number of model parameters and l h is the maximum value of the likelihood function of the model n is the total size sample number of year s is the number of predictors l is the maximum value of the likelihood function of the saturated model one free parameter per observation l is the maximum value for the likelihood of the fitted model and l 0 the maximum value of the likelihood function of the model with intercept only aic uses the parsimony principle it allows for the selection of the smallest set of predictive variables leading to the largest amount of variability to avoid complex model overfitting vandekerckhove et al 2015 boyce et al 2002 an eliminated variable that lead to reduction of the aic is considered as a non significant variable for gam or glm we assessed variable importance based on the f value and t value for gam and glm respectively wood 2013 d model calibration and performance evaluation the performance evaluation of statistical models was conducted using a leave one out cross validation loocv procedure on each year of the available periods since datasets are relatively small a loocv was preferred to other cross validation methods k fold split sample in the loocv method one data point one year is set apart from the n data of the dataset the statistical model is then applied to the remaining n 1 data for the automated parameter calibration the calibrated model is then run on the remaining year the procedure is conducted for all the years of the dataset the gam model performance was investigated in two steps first by comparing the forecasted peak flows with glm output on the full length of available maximum peak flow data then by comparing its performance to hydrotel used as a reference on the five years of data available for hydrotel output for each river the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 the relative root mean square error rrmse and relative bias rbias were used to compare the performances of the statistical models the closer to one the value of nse and the closer to zero the value of rrmse and rbias the better the performance of the model to assess the performance of the gam model in comparison to hydrotel model rrmse and rbias were calculated on the five available concomitant years given the low number of data nse was not used for the comparison with hydrotel as it is rather appropriate for continuous data the following equations were used 6 nse 1 i 1 n p i o i 2 i 1 n o o i 2 7 rrmse i 1 n p i o i 2 n o 8 rbias i 1 n p i o i n o where o is the observed daily peak flow o is the mean observed flow during n number of years i and pi is the i th predicted peak flow e real time operational model the applicability of the gam model was tested for real time forecasts with a day by day simulation as if the actual peak date was unknown simulations were conducted for the forecast of 2017 and 2018 spring freshet peak flow for pikauba river and 2018 peak flow for montmorency and cyriac rivers for each predictive variable the suitable lead time was previously selected on the historical series of peak flows for which we knew peak flow dates the proposed model is an adaptative model in which at each date a new forecast is produced based on the recent information the next day a new forecast is produced on adapted information for example for operational use in real time at day d we can extract the two day delay river flow q 2 at d 1 to predict the peak flow at d 1 and go on to the next day for each river the model was calibrated on the previous years dataset that is the model is not recalibrated on a daily basis during the flood season as the model is built only on annual maximum daily peak flow values it can only be recalibrated at the end of the spring flood season when the maximum flow value is known for the current season it is hence important to wait until the end of the spring flood season before retraining the model open source packages all programming was done using r software implementation of gam and glm was carried under mgcv package wood 2006 and stats package r core team 2020 respectively 4 results 4 1 peak flow forecast with statistical models glm and gam 4 1 1 significant predictive variables the meteorological station and the snow station showing the best correlation with hydrometric data were associated with each watershed table 6 l étape meteorological station was associated with four rivers i e the pikauba cyriac montmorency and malbaie rivers the roberval station was associated with the croche river three snow stations have been selected chicoutimi kiskissink and la galette as a first step linear and rank correlations with flow data and swe showed that the following variables were not significantly correlated for any rivers and were discarded the start of the melting date delay from the peak and monthly rainfall accumulation for monthly temperature and nao only the mean temperature of march and april were weakly correlated with the peak flows and the mean nao of march or april were weakly correlated with the swe of some rivers and were retained all other variables were retained to be tested with the statistical models table s1 in supp data as a second step from these datasets the combination of variables giving the lowest aic was found to be different amongst the rivers however the following variables were overall significant to predict the freshet peak flow with both statistical models glm and gam for the five studied rivers with some specificities with their duration and delay from the peak table 6 maximum snow cover water equivalent melting rate a few days before the flood peak daily river flow a few days before the flood peak mean air temperature a few days before the flood peak april or march mean air temperature rainfall accumulation a few days before the flood peak with the gam model five predictive variables were selected for the pikauba montmorency and malbaie rivers and only four predictors were selected for the croche and cyriac rivers the results of gam fitting on the predictive variables of the pikauba river are illustrated in fig 4 as an example see supp data for the fitting to other rivers the melting rate and the antecedent river flow were significant predictive variables for the five rivers with gam and glm model and showed a positive correlation with the peak flow the only difference between rivers was the duration of significant period to consider before flood peak the mswe on the watershed was also significant for the five rivers with gam but not for montmorency and malbaie rivers for glm this variable globally showed a weak positive correlation with peak flow mean air temperature measured a few days before the flood peak was a significant predictive variable for most rivers it is negatively correlated to peak flow intensity the significance of monthly temperature for march or april depended on the models and the rivers it was significant for the pikauba cyriac and montmorency rivers rainfall accumulation a few days before the flood peak was a significant predictive variable for the cyriac montmorency and malbaie rivers but not for the pikauba and croche rivers the cumulative impact of rainfall and temperature on river flow can be observed on the hydrographs of the 2018 freshet fig 2 several flow peaks were noticeable for the cyriac montmorency and malbaie rivers while fewer peaks were observable for the pikauba river and croche river nao was not selected as a predictive variable for any river the relative importance of the predictive variables varies from one river to another but the melting rate and the antecedent river flow were among the most important variables to forecast peak flow supp data table s2 the relative importance of rain and temperature was highly variable among the rivers and with the models swe was generally the least important predictive variable the forecast lead time was determined by the smaller delay of the selected set of variables for the four rivers pikauba cyriac montmorency and malbaie there had to be a 1 day delay variable in the predictive set to be significant usually the melting rate this meant that the rivers peak flow could only be forecasted at a 24 h lead time for the croche river it was possible to use the melting rate with a 1 day or a 2 day delay meaning that the peak flow could be forecasted with a 48 h and a 24 h lead time table 6 with the selected variables on a 24 h forecast the adjusted r2 and the deviance showed the highest values with gam for the pikauba croche cyriac and montmorency rivers adjusted r2 values ranged between 0 81 and 0 97 and deviance values were between 88 7 and 98 3 table 6 the results of the fitting on the malbaie river were weaker of the five rivers with a r2 value of 0 74 and an explained deviance of 79 7 the glm models showed lower adjusted r2 and deviance than gam models for the five rivers with especially low values on cyriac and montmorency rivers 4 1 2 peak flow forecasts with glm and gam model the results of gam forecasted flow compared to the measured spring freshet peak flows are illustrated in fig 5 the relative rmse varied between 18 6 and 7 3 for gam models and between 23 5 and 21 1 for the glm models table 6 for three rivers gam exhibited lower rrmse and rbias than glm and similar values for the malbaie river nse values varied from 0 59 to 0 93 for gam and from 0 47 to 0 81 for glm gam showed higher nse values than glm for three rivers the croche cyriac and montmorency rivers close values for the pikauba and identical values for the malbaie river for which variables showed a linear relationship with peak flow fig s5 supp data bias remained low for both models with the largest value of 2 6 for a 48 h forecast on the croche river with gam and 2 1 on the cyriac river with glm the gam model performance showed an improvement with the decrease of forecast lead time for the croche river with a rrmse of 21 3 for 48 h and 7 3 for 24 h based on the relative rmse relative bias and nse the gam model can be concluded to lead to a better performance than the glm model for the prediction of the annual freshet peak flow 4 2 comparison of peak flow forecast between gam and distributed model hydrotel the peak flows forecasted by the gam model were compared with the results of the hydrotel model from 2016 to 2020 using the same forecast lead time 24 h or 48 h table 7 for the four rivers with enough data to allow comparison gam model exhibited a lower relative rmse than hydrotel model with values ranging from 5 7 to 14 1 for gam and from 11 4 to 39 5 for hydrotel relative bias was lower for the gam model than for hydrotel for two of the four rivers no systematic bias was observed for the 24 h forecast of either model 4 3 real time peak flow forecast evaluation of gam and hydrotel real time peak flow forecast simulations were conducted with the gam model and were compared to hydrotel 24 h forecast fig 6 to allow for comparison figures show the measured river flows and the forecasted peak flows for the same dates on a daily time step and a 24 h lead time for both models the gam model allowed for a good forecast of the peak flow within 24 to 48 h the hydrotel model 24 h forecasts showed more variability on day to day basis than gam model forecasts as gam model was fitted on previous flood peaks only it showed higher flow than observed before the flood peak itself since the statistical model considers previous catchment conditions and not weather forecast it was not able to predict the recession following the peak therefore the model overestimated the flow rates once the actual peak had passed the overall maximum flood peak forecasted by hydrotel regardless of the lead time tended to converge towards the actual peak as the lead time to the actual peak flood decreased however hydrotel showed important daily variability and tended to highly overestimate the actual flood with a forecast horizon of 3 to 5 days before the peak 5 discussion 5 1 contextualization of the significant predictive variables for peak flow the selection of the significant variables was based on statistical model performance for each river while accounting for parsimony regarding the number of explicative variables in comparison to process based hydrological models flood peak could be forecasted from a pool of six variables the best combinations of predictive variables including the appropriate delay from the peak were river specific and were dependent on the hydrological context of the watersheds however the main significant variables for the forecast of peak flow are likely generalizable given the similarity in the physical processes of snowmelt runoff in forested watershed this is similar to the way temperature index snowmelt models using river flow can be applied successfully in several watershed configurations massmann 2019 the exact combination of variables and their relevant lag from peak flow must be set for each watershed 5 1 1 maximum snow water equivalent the mswe was among the significant predictive variables for the five rivers however although this variable is highly correlated with the total volume of the spring hydrograph which was not forecasted in the present study the mswe was one of the least important variables to forecast the peak flow table s2 supp data indeed a late spring snowstorm can generate a high water equivalent but this fresh snow might take time to ripen and for a given volume slower melting leads to a smaller flood peak than faster melting of a ripe snowpack this was observed for the montmorency and malbaie rivers which showed the highest elevation difference from the head of the basin to the outlet leading to a delayed melting of the upper part covered with fresher snow accentuated when rivers are flowing from north to south woo et al 2008 furthermore as meteorological variables are driving the melting process they modulate the influence of the amount of snow li and simonovic 2002 the peak flow intensity is strongly influenced by the meteorological conditions prevailing a few days before the peak rather than directly by the quantity of snow accumulation on the watershed hence for small or medium size watersheds the mswe is an indicator of the incoming peak flow but does not govern the peak flow intensity 5 1 2 previous river flow and melting rate as river flow is autocorrelated integration of the river flow and the rate of increase of the flow hydrograph proxy for melting rate for the few previous days improved significantly the peak flow forecast for the five rivers it was observed for most rivers that river flow and melting rate were significant for several delays for example 1 and 2 days before the peak in the present study only one delay was selected for each variable future work should consider the use of several significant delays for the same variable type when this variable is of importance as was done in fernando and jayawardena 1998 consequently some other variables of lesser importance should be removed to avoid overfitting the combination of an autoregressive flow model with a deterministic hydrological model was shown to bring efficient improvement in flood peak prediction arheimer et al 2011 5 1 3 air temperature air temperature triggers the melting process as it can be observed in fig 2 where the flood hydrograph starts with the positive mean air temperature this illustrates well why temperature based or degree day models can be useful for snowmelt evaluation agnihotri and coulibaly 2020 massmann 2019 in the present study where focus is on peak flow the impact of air temperature was river specific the correlation was positive for the pikauba and malbaie rivers and negative for the croche and montmorency rivers it can be hypothesised that the meteorological station l étape located at an elevation of 791 m was representative of the air temperature for the pikauba and the upper part of the malbaie watersheds located on high elevations and showing respectively north west and north east orientations on the other hand as the montmorency watershed shows a south orientation the actual mean air temperature might be higher than the recorded temperature at l étape and the melting starts earlier leading to a lower melting rate barnhart et al 2016 hence the station high temperature was likely associated to late peak flows when the melting is already advanced and the peak intensity is susceptible to be lower the same explanation might apply for the croche river and the roberval station which is at a low elevation but located at nearly a 100 km north of the watershed centroid furthermore the runoff and infiltration processes have been shown to be distinct for different slope orientation possibly linked to the difference in vegetation buttle et al 2000 with the gam model the peak flows of three of the rivers were better predicted with a 5 day mean temperature whereas for two rivers croche and malbaie it was the 3 day mean temperature that was the most efficient this result seems counter intuitive as these two rivers have the largest catchment areas watershed configuration and distance between the watershed and the meteorological station might explain this difference the monthly temperatures of march and april influence both snow accumulation and the ripening state of the snow cover for example for the pikauba river for which the mean date of flood peak is may 13th the correlation was negative between the temperature in april and the peak flow indeed in april the mean temperature can be positive implying that the melting of the snow cover has already started a colder april temperature means better preserved snow cover and fewer early partial melting events on this relatively high elevation watershed on the other hand for the cyriac river the relationship was positive with the temperature in march the temperatures in march are colder than those in april and remain negative henceforth a warmer temperature in march means more snowfall while a colder temperature means less snowfall davis et al 1999 5 1 4 previous rainfall rainfall accumulation preceding the peak flow was not a predictive variable for the pikauba and croche rivers for the pikauba river the flood wave is attenuated by the many head lakes of the watershed the croche river watershed which also has a head lake shows in addition the lowest slope of the five rivers and the river is significantly meandering in a large valley allowing attenuation of rainfall runoff the impact of rainfall on the watershed is specific to the watershed configuration furthermore rainfall can represent local events and although the stations showing the best correlation with the flow data were selected the stations were located outside the watersheds that is especially the case for the croche the cyriac and the malbaie rivers which may imply that some rainfall events could have been missed adding regional information by aggregating the meteorological and snow data from other stations could significantly improve flow results as shown by vaze et al 2011 with lumped datasets while still keeping the same accessible data sources and a simple methodology however as boreal regions are globally low populated areas data can be limited 5 1 5 north atlantic oscillation nao was not a predictor of peak flow the monthly nao index was not a significant predictor for peak flow for any of the five rivers although march and april nao were slightly correlated with swe this result supports the findings of mazouz et al 2013 who showed that seasonal nao and atlantic multi decadal oscillation mao were correlated to some flood characteristics duration timing frequency and variation but not peak magnitude for rivers in quebec with similar watershed sizes the relatively small catchment area and short duration of spring flood of the studied rivers might explain why the monthly nao index was not a direct predictive factor of the short term peak flow although it might influence water equivalent of snow cover nevertheless march and april nao were slightly correlated with swe it would be relevant to test also monthly mao or monthly arctic oscillation ao which is related to nao thiombiano et al 2017 for peak flow forecasting or for other flood characteristics 5 2 statistical models successfully predicted daily peak flow both statistical models glm and gam were able to forecast the maximum peak flow from few hydrological variables as expected because of the non linearity of predictive variables gam lead to a better performance than glm the relative rmse value obtained for the gam model equal or below 18 6 and nse between 0 59 and 0 93 compared favorably with the results of other hydrological models for peak flow forecasting see for instance westrick et al 2002 mean error of 31 for the most accurate peak flow forecasts agnihotri and coulibaly 2020 mean nse varying between 0 55 and 0 70 for the most accurate models or vaze et al 2011 67 of nse higher than 0 5 on peak flow forecast with a single meteorological station although the proposed statistical model assumes that daily values of temperature and precipitation from one meteorological station are representative of the condition of the entire watershed and despite the range of watershed sizes of the tested rivers factor 5 the gam model was well suited for the five rivers a higher relative rmse was found for the cyriac river which has also the smallest watershed area and might show more variability testing the model on a wider range of watershed size would allow to assess if there is an optimal range of use during the pre selection process it was noted that linear and rank correlations can be non significant for variables that are significant for the gam model due to the non linearity of the relationships between peak flow and the predictive variables linear and rank correlations should be used cautiously to discard variables and the selection should mainly be done using gam nonetheless as our datasets were relatively small there was a risk of overfitting the data hence for more robust models users should take advantage of reassessing the variables selection and recalibrate the model after a few years of use when more data are available the normal distribution was adopted in the present work because it provides a good fit to the station data and avoids the complexity of other models however the glm and gam models can be applied with other distributions normality is not a limiting factor for their application future work should adopt other distributions with different data sets to demonstrate and evaluate the generality of the proposed methodology 5 3 comparison of gam model with distributed model hydrotel limitations and perspectives the gam statistical model showed smaller rrmse and bias than hydrotel for a 24 h forecast specifically conducted on peak flow this was partly expected as hydrotel was not designed to provide short term flood peak forecast but rather to provide a predicted hydrograph and a longer term forecast than gam including a confidence level which is useful for decision makers hydrotel is calibrated to minimize the error between observed and simulated flow all year long which can generate bias on the prediction of extreme events farmer and vogel 2016 in contrast the gam model was specifically adjusted on spring maximum peak flow this brings a limitation of its use as the model is calibrated only to forecast peak flow it should be used only during the spring freshet when the melting has already started and as long as a qualitatively significant snow cover remains on the watershed which requires human observations it applies on rivers where there is a risk of flooding and where there is a known flow threshold for which an emergency plan must be launched decisions about a possible intervention have to be taken regarding the current hydrological conditions in addition to the model and calibrated in regard to false alarms hence a more extensive testing of day to day forecasts should be conducted to assess the predicted variability for a given flood or the probability of having a false alarm the real time testing though seems to show a stability in the prediction fig 6 and results on historical data for the tested rivers showed few highly overestimated peak flows fig 5 the comparison of the real time forecasts at the same time step showed that the gam model could be used advantageously especially in basins for which no deterministic hydrologic model is implemented the gam model gave a realistic order of magnitude of the upcoming flood although forecast is done for a short term period of 24 h or 48 h it can be used as a decision support to launch emergency measures peak flow intensity was overestimated by hydrotel for 3 to 5 day lead time possibly due to the use of weather forecasts as inputs which are still imprecise beyond three days although it could be argued that overestimating the flood brings a safety factor by triggering a flood watch when time comes to implement emergency measures the systematic positive bias can represent significant costs and inconveniences such as some emergency structural reinforcement the installation of temporary dikes or the evacuation of residences this systematic bias can also lead managers to get used to having lesser than expected floods and to take a passive attitude towards the flood to come future work could focus on the integration of meteorological forecasts in the gam model which might lead to the increase of the forecasting lead time which was rather short for the selected rivers in that case the forecast data of the global environmental multiscale model gem from the canadian meteorological centre mailhot et al 2006 should be used and might require complex data processing that would derogate from the more simple approach proposed herein the current gam model was dedicated to only forecast the peak flow and it does not simulate the whole hydrograph including the flow recession the model is based on the growth of the hydrograph and the antecedent flow which only increases as the flood peak approaches thus the present forecasting model must be accompanied by a subjective observation of the weather forecast and an observation of the water level to assess the recession phase it could be interesting to verify whether the addition of auto regressive flow or the volume runoff since the onset of snowmelt could make it possible to determine the recession phase and thus avoid overestimating the flow after the actual peak in its current form the model still requires human interpretation using the neighboring rivers to forecast the peak timing as the spring freshet is often synchronized in a region with delays between rivers known by local stakeholders an identical approach with gam model should be tested in future work for the forecast of the peak timing using similar predictive variables and auto regressive flow and rain bidwell and griffiths 1994 climate indices mazouz et al 2013 and or the cumulative flood volume already passed coupled to mswe for smaller watersheds higher frequency forecast could be obtained by using the hourly flow available at hydrometric stations however hourly air temperature data are not easily available and diurnal air temperature is highly variable in spring 6 conclusion the objective of this study was to implement an operational model to forecast spring flood peak flow for medium sized watersheds from easily accessible data and with minimal manipulation the model forecasts had to be reliable so they could be used to make decisions on triggering emergency measures for rivers vulnerable to flooding peak flow intensity can be assessed with few watershed characteristics and meteorological data the two statistical models tested glm and gam had the capacity to take into account the different predictive variables given the non linearity of hydrological phenomena the gam model moderately more complex than glm was better suited to forecast the peak flow this statistical model based on the current hydrograph characteristics and past weather conditions provided a good short term peak flow forecast the value of the expected discharge for 24 h lead time compared favorably with the distributed model hydrotel used as a reference the gam model was well suited to the whole range of medium sized watersheds tested the datasets used in the present study are relatively short the model would hence gain from being re calibrated after a few years by adding the more recent spring flood data of the studied rivers all variables used are accessible via the internet within a 24 h notice allowing forecasting at this minimum time step the best set of predictive variables is specific to each river however its selection can be automated and remains much simpler than implementing a more complex hydrological model the relatively simple implementation of gam makes it attractive when a more complex hydrological model is not already implemented and it makes it useable by any stakeholder during flood watch to help decision making although the distributed model hydrotel was also implemented on each studied watershed the gam model forecasts can be a complementary tool for emergency planning as they show less variability then hydrotel forecasts in the present study the flow value and rate of increase of the hydrograph were used as predictive variables as peak flow is auto correlated to river flow and all the rivers were gauged future efforts should be dedicated to use neighboring or comparable gauged river flow as an input variable instead of the same river flow as it is frequently done for flood quantile estimation at ungauged basin ouarda et al 2000 melcc 2021c with this extension the model could allow forecasting peak flows at ungauged rivers and would be even more relevant as shown by arheimer et al 2011 the model performance would benefit from any improvements in the different elements on the chain data source with the integration of multiple meteorological stations variable selectivity including auto regressive data and a more extensive testing of real time forecasts the proposed model does not allow to forecast peak timing and flow recession but the use of the gam model to forecast peak timing is an avenue for future work future work should also focus on quantifying the real advantages of using more complex models such as gam and the trade off between reduced bias and increased estimation variance associate to over parameterization future research efforts may also focus on the comparison of the gam model to other commonly used forecasting approaches such as the non parametric k nearest neighbor k nn model and explore daily and or hourly time series approach since there can be lags of unknown duration between important peak flow events in a time series recurrent neural networks rnn and more specifically long short term memory lstm which is an optimization of rnn that was shown to be well suited for making prediction based on time series data xu et al 2020 the combination of models using neural networks could be explored to obtain forecasts for different time horizons tsakiri et al 2018 the emerging functional data analysis fda approach could be applied to the same basins studied in the present work fda has been shown in recent studies to lead to reliable forecasts for a number of hydro climatic variables see for instance

3206,vegetation patches grow on permeable beds but the effects of bed permeability on the hydrodynamic characteristics of channels with vegetation patches are rarely discussed in this study emergent rigid cylinders are used to represent a vegetation patch and porous media are utilized to represent the sediment multiple groups of conditions with various bed permeabilities are simulated the results show that when the bed permeability is high a jet flow forms downstream of the patch with increasing bed permeability the velocity distribution of the karman vortex block is closer to the level in front of the patch and the peak value of the turbulent kinetic energy increases and extends downstream however when the bed permeability is low the hydrodynamic characteristics in a channel with a vegetation patch hccvps change negligibly with the bed permeability the bed permeability has a threshold effect on the hccvps a further discussion suggests that the permeability reynolds number rek is suitable for characterizing the bed permeability and its threshold effect the magnitude of the rek threshold that corresponds to the change in hydrodynamic characteristics is 1 these new results also explain the process differences in sediment transport and patch expansion under different bed permeability conditions keywords bed permeability vegetation patch hydrodynamic characteristics numerical simulation permeability reynolds number 1 introduction vegetation is widely distributed in natural rivers lakes wetlands and coastal areas furthermore it plays an essential role in aquatic ecosystems by changing the flow structure shan et al 2019 affecting the transport of sediment and nutrients cornacchia et al 2019 curran and hession 2013 and changing the morphology of the bed surface wu et al 2021 in the field vegetation is mainly present in patches with finite length and width liu and shan 2019 the flow separates along the lateral boundary of each patch and the longitudinal velocity increases along both sides of the patch and decreases inside the patch kitsikoudis et al 2020 yamasaki et al 2021 then a stable wake region and karman vortex street region form downstream of the patch liu et al 2018 the velocity and turbulent energy in the stable wake region decrease and sedimentation naturally occurs box et al 2019 liu and nepf 2016 in addition the karman vortex street causes the velocity and turbulence energy peak to approach those of the upstream of the patch gu et al 2019 most of the studies that are cited above are based on the assumption that the bed permeability is extremely low it has been observed that the slip velocity is nonzero above a permeable bed there is a velocity gradient across the interface breugem et al 2006 suga et al 2010 the karman constant that corresponds to the average velocity distribution above a permeable bed is significantly lower than that above an impermeable bed zippe and graf 1983 the turbulent structure near the surface of a bed with high permeability penetrates the sediment jouybari and lundstrom 2021 and intense energy transfer occurs near the interface manes et al 2009 moreover the shear stress above a permeable bed is greater than that above an impermeable bed kim et al 2018b suga et al 2011 manes et al 2011 found that the turbulence structure near a bed changes with the bed permeability we can naturally imagine that the bed permeability affects the hydrodynamic characteristics in a channel with a vegetation patch hccvps the bed permeabilities of mountain rivers and constructed wetlands are high and there are plant patches afzalimehr and dey 2009 chui et al 2011 comiti et al 2011 johnes et al 2020 in these cases on which areas should we focus and what effects does the bed permeability have on the hccvps coincidentally the presence of a vegetation patch can produce a pressure difference on the bed surface which is similar to the impact of the bed topography the mechanism of vegetation driven material exchange under the condition of a permeable bed is similar to that of the bed topography driving hyporheic exchange through experiments blois et al 2014 compared the flow field differences under various bed permeabilities furthermore flow velocity and reynolds stress distribution differences in the flow separation zone on the leeward side of the topography were observed according to sinha et al 2017 when the bed permeability is high the leeward side of the terrain has jet flow upward from the sediment layer which changes the flow characteristics of the flow separation zone and lifts the shear layer away from the bed compared with the studies of blois et al 2014 and sinha et al 2017 we need to focus more attention on the downstream side of the vegetation patch when the bed permeability is high the flow velocity and turbulent energy distribution on the downstream side of the vegetation patch may differ significantly from those in previous studies currently there is a lack of research on how the hccvps change under different bed permeability conditions the hccvps significantly affect sediment transport liu and nepf 2016 nutrient absorption of vegetation cornacchia et al 2019 patch expansion and other processes yamasaki et al 2021 studying the hccvps under various bed permeability conditions and their influence on the above processes will provide new insights into the hydrodynamic and water quality coupling modeling of open channel flows that contain vegetation and provide a reference on the hyporheic exchange that is driven by vegetation patches thus the purpose of this investigation is to clarify the effects of bed permeability on the hccvps the remainder of this manuscript is organized as follows first we introduce our numerical simulation method in section 2 via comparison with previous flume tests and direct numerical simulation results the accuracy of the mathematical model that is established in this paper and the corresponding model setting are verified in section 3 1 in combination with flow field traces near the vegetation patch in section 3 2 the influence range and degree of bed permeability on the hccvps are determined special attention is given to the downstream side of the patch the flow velocity distributions and turbulent kinetic energy distributions of measurement lines under various bed permeability conditions are presented in section 3 3 the permeability reynolds number rek is used to characterize the influence of the bed permeability the rek threshold that is related to the change in flow hydraulic characteristics is discussed in sections 4 1 and 4 2 finally the limitations of this study and the application of the results are explained in section 4 3 2 methodology the vegetation patch can present in a gravel bed when there is sand or silt layer under the gravel layer below the swi jahadi et al 2019 in addition various submerged plants grow in river channels beaches and other places containing emergent vegetation patches riis and biggs 2003 some studies regarded submerged plants as special beds and generalized them with porous media brito et al 2016 hadadpour et al 2019 hoffmann 2004 the equivalent bed corresponding to submerged plants can be approximated as a sediment layer the corresponding actual situations studied in this paper include the following two types one is the gravel channel with emergent vegetation patches and the other is the channel with emergent vegetation patches on the special bed for the convenience of explanation equivalent beds corresponding to submerged plants and gravel beds are uniformly referred to as sediment in the following paper fig 1 presents a schematic diagram of the mathematical model the numerical simulation calculation area and boundary conditions are illustrated in fig 1a the length of the area that contained the sediment layer was 6 m and 5 m adjustment sections were added before and after the depth of the overlying water was 0 3 m the flow was always subcritical fr 1 in this case it was reasonable to treat the top face as a frictionless rigid lid alfrink and van rijn 1983 and numerically made it a symmetry boundary considering the sediment depth in previous studies on the permeable bed blois et al 2014 voermans et al 2018 and hyporheic exchange depth driven by vegetation yuan et al 2021 and the height of submerged plants kalra et al 2017 the simulated sediment depth was selected as 0 3 m the inlet of the model was defined as the velocity inlet boundary the outlet boundary was the pressure outlet we supposed that the flow in the sediment was replenished and driven by the overlying water approximately seven million grids were used for each simulation condition based on grid independence testing the arrangement of the vegetation patch is shown in fig 1b the diameter d of a single plant rod was 1 cm in this paper the volume fraction of the vegetation guaranteed the formation of a karman vortex street kim et al 2018a scholars used dense spheres to represent the sediment layer han et al 2018 kim and kang 2020 which required a significant computational load therefore porous media were applied to represent the sediment layer lee et al 2020 ren et al 2019 many studies utilized rans to calculate the overlying water and used darcy s law and continuity equation to compute the porous media cardenas and wilson 2007 yuan et al 2021 moreover they treated the swi as a nonslip boundary the overlying water and sediment were coupled through the pressure distribution on the sediment water interface swi based on the numerical simulation method above we made various improvements porous media were utilized to represent the sediment the sediment layer was divided into two zones by porosity namely a porous medium region with uniform porosity ϕ 0 and a transition region with porosity that varied from 1 to ϕ 0 as illustrated in fig 1c the interface of the transition zone and overlying water was set to the interior thereby ensuring the continuity of the velocity and stress table 1 shows the parameter settings of porous media and the flow velocity conditions of overlying water under different bed types based on the literature research in table 1 we set five inlet flow velocity conditions from 0 1 m s to 0 5 m s which were varied at intervals of 0 1 m s the sediment particle size in the porous media was selected as 5 mm and a total of 9 cases with porosities of 0 1 0 9 were considered with 0 1 interval variation which corresponded to nine bed permeabilities in the field thus the hydraulic conductivity k1 of the sediment layer studied in this paper ranged from 1 68 10 3 to 9 93 101 m s in addition the interface between the transition zone and the overlying water was set as a wall and five groups of incoming flow conditions were calculated accordingly we used the realizable k ε model to calculate the whole flow field the realizable k ε model is likely to provide superior performance for flows involving rotation boundary layers under strong adverse pressure gradients separation and recirculation it was assumed that the turbulence was isothermal and incompressible the flow field for the overlying water was determined by solving the steady reynolds averaged continuity and momentum equations 1 u i x i 0 2 u i t u j u i x j 1 ρ p x i ν 2 u i x j x j u i u j x j f

5 and η s k ε the model constants are c2 1 9 σ k 1 0 and σ ε 1 2 when calculating the sediment layer we enabled porous medium options and suppressed the effect of turbulence in the medium the porous medium was assumed to be homogeneous isotropic and saturated with a single phase fluid the model transported the turbulence quantities through the porous medium in addition the generation of turbulence was set to zero in the medium in essence only one momentum equation depicted the model containing the overlying water and sediment the source term for sediment layer in the eq 2 is expressed in eq 5 flow velocity within the porous medium can be modeled by the darcy s equation however the darcy s equation only simply characterizes linear seepage processes in porous mediums with the increase of fluctuations in the porous medium the seepage process might be nonlinear the inertia force term forchheimer term accounts for the deviation from linearity which is essential for large filtration velocity luo et al 2022 meanwhile the effective viscosity was introduced to assess the influence of the porous media on the diffusion term in the momentum equation here the brinkman correction was adopted to calculate the effective viscosity as expressed in eq 6 5 s i μ α v i c 3 1 2 ρ v v i in which si is the source term for the ith x y z momentum equation the first term on the

overlying water were significantly changed if the thin transition layer between the overlying water and the homogeneous porous medium region is not considered the turbulence level near the swi will be overestimated kuwata and suga 2013 there is a transition zone in the sediment layer where the porosity changes from 1 to ϕ 0 referring to the research results of al aabidy et al 2020 the thickness of the transition region was set as 2dp and the porosity of the transition region was calculated by eq 10 10 ϕ ϕ 0 1 ϕ 0 exp 4 z 0 z d p where ϕ 0 is the porosity of the uniform porous medium and z0 represents the height of the swi 3 results 3 1 model validation the flume test results of gao et al 2021 and the direct numerical simulation results of breugem et al 2006 were verified both of which used the same model setting method as the above in addition we also changed some model settings for calculation such as the transition layer did not suppress the impact of turbulence and the entire sediment layer did not consider the inertia force term fig 2 illustrates the test flume and survey line arrangement in gao et al 2021 the thickness of the sediment layer was 0 2 m the median particle size of the sediment layer was 1 cm and the porosity was 0 3 it can reflect the applicability of the model in this paper when the hydraulic conductivity k1 is about 0 3 m s the experimental conditions with an average velocity u0 of 0 3 m s and an average water depth of 0 4 m above the swi were selected the simulated and measured values of the velocity and turbulence kinetic energy tke of typical survey lines along the vertical distribution are presented in fig 3 a and fig 3b respectively when using the model setting method in this paper the simulated velocity and turbulent kinetic energy are in satisfactory agreement with the measured values it is advisable to consider the inertial resistance term in the sediment layer simulation the velocity simulation results under the impermeable bed assumption differ significantly from the measured values near the swi the simulation results for the turbulence kinetic energy distribution under the impermeable bed assumption differ noticeably from the measured values moreover if the turbulence in the transition layer is not suppressed the calculated tke in the area near the swi differs significantly from the measured value to further validate the applicability of the model to various permeability conditions the model setting method was adopted in this paper to verify the direct numerical simulation results of breugem et al 2006 the experimental conditions with a spherical particle size of 0 53 cm and a porosity of 0 95 were selected it can represent the feasibility of the model in this paper when the bed permeability is pretty high fig 4 compares the results that were obtained using the four numerical simulation methods based on the comparison of velocity distribution and tke distribution the simulated values obtained by the proposed model setting method are in satisfactory agreement with dns results if the turbulence in the sediment layer is not suppressed the tke obtained by simulation has a significant deviation compared with the dns results moreover fig 5 shows the comparison between the calculation results of the model in this paper when the permeability is low and the results when the interface is impervious the simulation condition with an average velocity u0 of 0 3 m s and a porosity of 0 1 was selected the position of the measuring line was at x l 12 5 we can find that the two results are in good agreement in summary the model settings that are adopted in this paper are reasonable the treatments of the interface and the sediment layer are relatively accurate 3 2 flow field with traces and vorticity field referring to the results of zong and nepf 2012 we selected the area range of x l 7 5 25 l is the length of the vegetation patch which is 0 2 m to study the vegetation patch is located in the region of x l 10 11 fig 6 shows the flow fields in the study area under four typical simulation conditions and the same incoming flow conditions which are visually represented by traces a pressure difference is formed on the interface before and after the vegetation patch furthermore the pressure difference drives the exchange between the overlying water and the sediment layer the higher the bed permeability is the faster the exchange between the overlying water and sediment layer is and the higher the average velocity value in the sediment layer as the flow passes over the vegetation patch it creates an area of low pressure the pore water in the sediment layer flows from the low pressure area to the overlying water and the flow path is similar to the path of hyporheic exchange that is driven by the bed topography cardenas and wilson 2007 with increasing bed permeability the active exchange zone of the overlying water expands obviously along the vertical direction and the velocity near the swi increases when the bed permeability exceeds a threshold the positive vertical velocity above the swi on the downstream side of the vegetation patch increases and jet flow forms blois et al 2014 the longitudinal distribution of the pressure on the swi is shown in fig 7 when the bed permeability is low the pressure difference between the front and back of the patch is significant the pressure of the patch downstream gradually increases along the longitudinal direction and the active exchange area is concentrated in the patch area with increasing permeability the pressure difference before and after the patch decreases the pressure of the patch downstream gradually decreases along the longitudinal direction and the active exchange area expands along the flow direction the bed permeability determines the flow resistance in the sediment layer and changes the pressure distribution on the swi which affects the hccvps the simulation scenario that corresponds to re 9 104 was considered as an example there is an approximate rule that is similar to the above under different reynolds numbers vorticity originates from a velocity gradient in the flow field and is a kinematic physical quantity that describes swirling flow which plays a vital role in vortex motion fig 8 shows the y vorticity of the longitudinal section y 0 15 m under various bed permeability conditions when the bed permeability is low the viscous force near the swi induces a velocity gradient difference the y vorticity near the swi is large the vortex size is small and the vorticity of the overlying water far from the swi is small and uniform when the bed permeability exceeds a threshold a large vorticity in the area near the swi develops downward furthermore a jet flow forms on the downstream side of the vegetation patch and the flow turbulence intensifies which results in large scale whirlpools consequently the vorticity of the overlying water in the wake region increases 3 3 velocity distribution and turbulent kinetic energy distribution to further examine the hccvps differences under various bed permeability conditions the simulation scenario that corresponds to re 9 104 was considered as an example and the simulation results under other flow rates are presented in the supplementary data fig 9 illustrates the longitudinal distribution of the average velocity with depth the velocity in fig 9 refers to the average velocity between z h 0 and 1 at a specified point x on the longitudinal section y 0 15 m for the front area of the vegetation patch the higher the bed permeability is the lower the velocity is which is related to the exchange between the overlying water and the sediment the flow from the overlying water into the sediment layer is larger with higher bed permeability according to the research results of zong and nepf 2012 the area from the tail of the vegetation patch to the inflection point of the longitudinal distribution of the velocity can be preliminarily classified as a stable wake region the length of the stable wake zone is similar among the simulated conditions and the end of the stable wake zone is located near x l 20 interestingly when da 1 91 10 9 7 72 10 7 the longitudinal distribution of the velocity remains unchanged with changes in permeability when da is greater than 7 72 10 7 the velocity recovers faster to the level at the front of the patch with increasing bed permeability fig 10 shows the vertical distribution of the velocity on various survey lines located on the longitudinal section y 0 15 m we observe that the influence of the bed permeability on the velocity distribution in front of the vegetation patch is concentrated at z h 0 2 the main difference lies in the slip velocity when da 1 91 10 9 7 72 10 7 the vertical distribution of the velocity is very similar and the simulation scenario that corresponds to da 8 5 10 8 is represented here the bed permeability mainly affects the velocity distribution downstream of the vegetation patch when da is greater than 7 72 10 7 the velocity above the swi adjacent to the downstream patch decreases with increasing bed permeability the higher the bed permeability is the faster the velocity distribution in the karman vortex block recovers to the level in front of the vegetation patch the distribution of turbulent kinetic energy in the longitudinal section y 0 15 m is shown in fig 11 the bed permeability mainly affects the distribution of the turbulent energy downstream of the patch but not upstream on the downstream side of the patch the turbulent kinetic energy near the swi increases significantly when the bed permeability exceeds a threshold and the peak value of the turbulent kinetic energy increases and extends downstream with increasing bed permeability for the simulated condition with re 9 0 104 the da threshold is approximately 7 72 10 7 the longitudinal distribution of the turbulent kinetic energy is similar when da 1 91 10 9 2 74 10 7 when x l is 20 the turbulent kinetic energy near the swi is tiny thereby indicating that the position that corresponds to x l 20 is the end of the stable wake region in the karman vortex block the turbulent kinetic energy near the top of the overlying water decreases with increasing bed permeability 4 discussion 4 1 characterizing the hccvps changes by rek the analysis results in section 3 show that bed permeability affects mainly the flow structure downstream of the vegetation patch under the same incoming flow conditions the flow structure remains unchanged with changes in the bed permeability when it is less than a threshold value above this threshold the flow structure changes significantly with changes in the bed permeability although the darcy number can represent the bed permeability it is not easy to obtain a universal threshold in practical applications because it depends on the thickness h of the sediment layer the permeability reynolds number rek can represent the influence of the bed permeability breugem et al 2006 and consider the turbulent flow characteristics near the swi it is also a critical evaluation index for studying the turbulent characteristics at the swi grant et al 2018 and identifying the dominant mechanism of material transport and diffusion near the swi voermans et al 2017 which can be calculated by eq 11 it is more appropriate to obtain the threshold value of rek to characterize the threshold effect of the bed permeability as discussed above when rek is small the swi is approximately an impermeable wall whereas when rek is large the swi can be classified as a highly permeable bed surface a flow with a vegetation patch is generally divided into four partitions upstream of the patch the patch region the stable wake region and the karman vortex block according to the vorticity field typical velocity distribution and turbulence kinetic energy distribution near the swi the stable wake region changes more significantly with the bed permeability than other zones and its range is easier to obtain moreover the flow structure in the stable wake region plays an essential role in predicting patch expansion and sediment transport therefore the quantity rek that is adopted in this paper is the average permeability reynolds number in the stable wake region 11 r e k u k 1 2 υ where u is the friction velocity and the average turbulence kinetic energy of 0 1 h above the swi is used to estimate u k represents the actual permeability and can be approximated by α in the porous media here the range of the stable wake region that is used to estimate u is x l 12 5 20 and the turbulence in this region can be approximately considered to be generated by the bed surface stapleton and huntley 1995 in this equation u 0 19 t k e 1 2 the intervals of the rek thresholds that are related to hydraulic characteristics such as the velocity distribution and turbulent kinetic energy distribution in the wake area of the vegetation patch are listed in table 2 under the same incoming flow conditions rek increases with increasing da considering the simulation scenario that corresponds to re 9 0 104 as an example the interval of threshold da is 2 74 10 7 7 72 10 7 and the interval of corresponding threshold rek is 2 38 4 15 in general the rek threshold is of the magnitude of 1 as shown in table 2 when rek is lower than the threshold value the flow structure remains unchanged with changes in the bed permeability when rek is higher than the threshold value the flow structure changes with changes in the bed permeability 4 2 the magnitude and influencing factors of rek threshold the flow resistance of the vegetation is related to the hydrodynamic characteristics in the channel box et al 2021 mancheño et al 2021 the frictional resistance and shape resistance of the vegetation patch under various simulation conditions were extracted and the average drag coefficient cd of the stem in the vegetation patch was calculated using eq 12 the relationship between the average stem resistance and rek is shown in fig 12 the shaded part represents the magnitude of rek threshold i e rek o 1 when rek o 1 the flow resistance remains unchanged when rek o 1 the flow resistance decreases significantly with increasing rek the change degree of the flow resistance under the same inflow and different bed permeabilities can partially represent the change degree of the corresponding flow structure 12 f d 1 2 c d ρ a v u 0 2 where f d is the plant resistance a v is the characteristic reference area and u 0 is the mean velocity of the incoming flow we changed the vegetation density and set the distance d between adjacent stems to 0 1 m fig 13 shows the relationship between the flow resistance of the vegetation and rek at this density the rek threshold still is of the magnitude of 1 when rek o 1 the flow resistance remains unchanged when rek o 1 the flow resistance significantly decreases with increasing rek according to figs 12 and 13 when rek exceeds the threshold the slope of cd changing with rek is related to the velocity the red arrow shows the change of the rek threshold with the velocity the higher the velocity the higher the rek threshold we can infer from the slope of the red arrows that the rek threshold is related to the plant density and increases with increasing plant density under the same incoming flow velocity conditions suga et al 2017 found that low speed and high speed stripes that are similar to solid wall turbulence are observed near the wall when rek is small but when rek is large the observed turbulence structure differs significantly from that of a solid wall according to voermans et al 2017 when rek exceeds a threshold of approximately 1 2 the turbulent stress begins to dominate the shear stress at the swi the velocity conditions in voermans et al 2017 s study were 0 03 0 115 m s when the average velocity is 0 1 m s the rek threshold for two vegetation densities determined in this research is between 1 and 2 when describing solute transport diffusion a commonly used rek threshold is o 1 grant et al 2018 voermans et al 2018 turbulent diffusion is considered dominant when rek is greater than o 1 while molecular diffusion is dominant when rek is less than o 1 in conclusion the magnitude of rek threshold that corresponds to changes in the hydrodynamic characteristics in the wake area of the vegetation patch is consistent with that of previous studies without plants our results suggest that when rek is less than the threshold value of the corresponding conditions previous research results can approximate the hccvps and the methods that were used in previous studies to calculate flow resistance with vegetation are still valid however when we preliminarily judge that rek exceeds the critical threshold under corresponding conditions we should conduct experimental or numerical simulation research on the hydraulic characteristics and resistance characteristics of water flow with vegetation patches and utilize on site observations if possible 4 3 limitations of this study and the application of the results most patches grow on clay or sandy riverbeds with very low bed permeability at this point the hydrodynamic characteristics of surface water flow are little affected by groundwater the corresponding actual situations in this paper include gravelly channels containing emergent plant patches and channels containing multi layer plants the numerical simulation results can reflect the hydrodynamic characteristics of an isolated emergent plant patch strip with a permeable bed in a natural river system the interaction between vegetation patches de lima et al 2015 and the size of vegetation patches yu et al 2021 will change the hydrodynamic characteristics of the wake area however the magnitude of rek threshold obtained in this paper which represents the influence of bed permeability on the hydrodynamic characteristics in a channel with a vegetation patch is universal we used realizable k ε model to modeling the surface flow the rans model has been shown to have difficulty predicting increasingly complex or fine scale turbulence features models like detached eddy simulation des and large eddy simulation les were developed to depict the turbulent flow structure better rigid cylinders were used to represent emergent vegetation gu et al 2019 in previous studies this simplification was commonly utilized nevertheless the effects of leaves and branches on flow were ignored in our research the flexibility of the stems were neglected we can imagine that complex vegetation canopy can notably impact the turbulence structures and consequently lead to more complex flow pattern in the patch wake area caroppi et al 2022 moreover we assumed that the sediment was homogenous and essentially treated as a source term in the model thus the depiction of groundwater flow is not accurate enough furthermore we supposed that the stress was continuous at the swi and suppressed the turbulence near the swi however the bed roughness and the turbulent characteristics of some areas below the swi should be taken into account the stress jump conditions at the swi may be more appropriate de lemos 2005 in this paper we can obtain the hydrodynamic characteristics of overlying water comparatively accurately by setting the transition layer and applying the darcy brinkman forchheimer model in the sediment layer but the model can still be improved in the future in the study of flow in an area that is covered by vegetation patches more attention is given to sediment transport which impacts the habitat near the riverbed pomeroy et al 2017 when the bed permeability is low the velocity distribution and turbulent kinetic energy distribution of the permeable bed downstream of plant patches are close to those of the impermeable bed and sediment settlement easily occurs in the stable wake area when the bed permeability is high jet flows form on the downstream side adjacent to the plant patches and the turbulent kinetic energy near the swi is significantly increased the sediment does not easily settle and the riverbed may even experience erosion the accelerated flow near patch edges can reduce sediment deposition erode river channels and inhibit the lateral expansion of patches bouma et al 2009 follett and nepf 2012 in contrast the reduced velocity in the patch wake area can promote sediment deposition liu and shan 2019 provide shelter for the growth of new plants and promote the growth of patches along the direction of water flow chen et al 2012 yamasaki et al 2021 yamasaki et al 2019 predicted the expansion process of plant patches by selecting the velocity as the discriminant condition when the bed permeability is high and rek exceeds the threshold value the turbulence in the stable wake zone is enhanced it is no longer suitable to judge only according to velocity and a comprehensive evaluation should be carried out based on the shear stress of the bed this work serves as a starting point for future research 5 conclusions this paper used emergent rigid cylinders to represent a vegetation patch porous media were used to characterize sediment layers and the swi was treated as a permeable interface multiple groups of permeabilities were simulated and the following conclusions were drawn 1 the bed permeability determines the exchange area between the overlying water and the sediment layer changes the velocity and turbulent kinetic energy distributions near the swi and affects mainly the flow structure downstream of the vegetation patch 2 the permeability reynolds number rek can be used to determine the threshold effect of the bed permeability on the hydrodynamic characteristics in a channel with a vegetation patch when rek is less than the threshold value for the corresponding conditions the hccvps do not change with the bed permeability when rek is greater than the threshold value for the corresponding conditions the hccvps change significantly with the bed permeability a jet flow from the downstream side of the plant patch and the turbulent kinetic energy near the bed surface increases significantly in the wake region compared with that at low permeability 3 the rek threshold is related to the plant density and incoming flow velocity the magnitude of the rek threshold value that corresponds to the changes in hydrodynamic characteristics is 1 in practical applications when we preliminarily judge that rek is less than the critical threshold under corresponding conditions the hccvps approximately follow the results of previous research otherwise the hydraulic characteristics and resistance characteristics of water flow with vegetation patches should be tested or numerically simulated and field observations should be used if possible attention should also be focused on sediment transport patch expansion

3206,vegetation patches grow on permeable beds but the effects of bed permeability on the hydrodynamic characteristics of channels with vegetation patches are rarely discussed in this study emergent rigid cylinders are used to represent a vegetation patch and porous media are utilized to represent the sediment multiple groups of conditions with various bed permeabilities are simulated the results show that when the bed permeability is high a jet flow forms downstream of the patch with increasing bed permeability the velocity distribution of the karman vortex block is closer to the level in front of the patch and the peak value of the turbulent kinetic energy increases and extends downstream however when the bed permeability is low the hydrodynamic characteristics in a channel with a vegetation patch hccvps change negligibly with the bed permeability the bed permeability has a threshold effect on the hccvps a further discussion suggests that the permeability reynolds number rek is suitable for characterizing the bed permeability and its threshold effect the magnitude of the rek threshold that corresponds to the change in hydrodynamic characteristics is 1 these new results also explain the process differences in sediment transport and patch expansion under different bed permeability conditions keywords bed permeability vegetation patch hydrodynamic characteristics numerical simulation permeability reynolds number 1 introduction vegetation is widely distributed in natural rivers lakes wetlands and coastal areas furthermore it plays an essential role in aquatic ecosystems by changing the flow structure shan et al 2019 affecting the transport of sediment and nutrients cornacchia et al 2019 curran and hession 2013 and changing the morphology of the bed surface wu et al 2021 in the field vegetation is mainly present in patches with finite length and width liu and shan 2019 the flow separates along the lateral boundary of each patch and the longitudinal velocity increases along both sides of the patch and decreases inside the patch kitsikoudis et al 2020 yamasaki et al 2021 then a stable wake region and karman vortex street region form downstream of the patch liu et al 2018 the velocity and turbulent energy in the stable wake region decrease and sedimentation naturally occurs box et al 2019 liu and nepf 2016 in addition the karman vortex street causes the velocity and turbulence energy peak to approach those of the upstream of the patch gu et al 2019 most of the studies that are cited above are based on the assumption that the bed permeability is extremely low it has been observed that the slip velocity is nonzero above a permeable bed there is a velocity gradient across the interface breugem et al 2006 suga et al 2010 the karman constant that corresponds to the average velocity distribution above a permeable bed is significantly lower than that above an impermeable bed zippe and graf 1983 the turbulent structure near the surface of a bed with high permeability penetrates the sediment jouybari and lundstrom 2021 and intense energy transfer occurs near the interface manes et al 2009 moreover the shear stress above a permeable bed is greater than that above an impermeable bed kim et al 2018b suga et al 2011 manes et al 2011 found that the turbulence structure near a bed changes with the bed permeability we can naturally imagine that the bed permeability affects the hydrodynamic characteristics in a channel with a vegetation patch hccvps the bed permeabilities of mountain rivers and constructed wetlands are high and there are plant patches afzalimehr and dey 2009 chui et al 2011 comiti et al 2011 johnes et al 2020 in these cases on which areas should we focus and what effects does the bed permeability have on the hccvps coincidentally the presence of a vegetation patch can produce a pressure difference on the bed surface which is similar to the impact of the bed topography the mechanism of vegetation driven material exchange under the condition of a permeable bed is similar to that of the bed topography driving hyporheic exchange through experiments blois et al 2014 compared the flow field differences under various bed permeabilities furthermore flow velocity and reynolds stress distribution differences in the flow separation zone on the leeward side of the topography were observed according to sinha et al 2017 when the bed permeability is high the leeward side of the terrain has jet flow upward from the sediment layer which changes the flow characteristics of the flow separation zone and lifts the shear layer away from the bed compared with the studies of blois et al 2014 and sinha et al 2017 we need to focus more attention on the downstream side of the vegetation patch when the bed permeability is high the flow velocity and turbulent energy distribution on the downstream side of the vegetation patch may differ significantly from those in previous studies currently there is a lack of research on how the hccvps change under different bed permeability conditions the hccvps significantly affect sediment transport liu and nepf 2016 nutrient absorption of vegetation cornacchia et al 2019 patch expansion and other processes yamasaki et al 2021 studying the hccvps under various bed permeability conditions and their influence on the above processes will provide new insights into the hydrodynamic and water quality coupling modeling of open channel flows that contain vegetation and provide a reference on the hyporheic exchange that is driven by vegetation patches thus the purpose of this investigation is to clarify the effects of bed permeability on the hccvps the remainder of this manuscript is organized as follows first we introduce our numerical simulation method in section 2 via comparison with previous flume tests and direct numerical simulation results the accuracy of the mathematical model that is established in this paper and the corresponding model setting are verified in section 3 1 in combination with flow field traces near the vegetation patch in section 3 2 the influence range and degree of bed permeability on the hccvps are determined special attention is given to the downstream side of the patch the flow velocity distributions and turbulent kinetic energy distributions of measurement lines under various bed permeability conditions are presented in section 3 3 the permeability reynolds number rek is used to characterize the influence of the bed permeability the rek threshold that is related to the change in flow hydraulic characteristics is discussed in sections 4 1 and 4 2 finally the limitations of this study and the application of the results are explained in section 4 3 2 methodology the vegetation patch can present in a gravel bed when there is sand or silt layer under the gravel layer below the swi jahadi et al 2019 in addition various submerged plants grow in river channels beaches and other places containing emergent vegetation patches riis and biggs 2003 some studies regarded submerged plants as special beds and generalized them with porous media brito et al 2016 hadadpour et al 2019 hoffmann 2004 the equivalent bed corresponding to submerged plants can be approximated as a sediment layer the corresponding actual situations studied in this paper include the following two types one is the gravel channel with emergent vegetation patches and the other is the channel with emergent vegetation patches on the special bed for the convenience of explanation equivalent beds corresponding to submerged plants and gravel beds are uniformly referred to as sediment in the following paper fig 1 presents a schematic diagram of the mathematical model the numerical simulation calculation area and boundary conditions are illustrated in fig 1a the length of the area that contained the sediment layer was 6 m and 5 m adjustment sections were added before and after the depth of the overlying water was 0 3 m the flow was always subcritical fr 1 in this case it was reasonable to treat the top face as a frictionless rigid lid alfrink and van rijn 1983 and numerically made it a symmetry boundary considering the sediment depth in previous studies on the permeable bed blois et al 2014 voermans et al 2018 and hyporheic exchange depth driven by vegetation yuan et al 2021 and the height of submerged plants kalra et al 2017 the simulated sediment depth was selected as 0 3 m the inlet of the model was defined as the velocity inlet boundary the outlet boundary was the pressure outlet we supposed that the flow in the sediment was replenished and driven by the overlying water approximately seven million grids were used for each simulation condition based on grid independence testing the arrangement of the vegetation patch is shown in fig 1b the diameter d of a single plant rod was 1 cm in this paper the volume fraction of the vegetation guaranteed the formation of a karman vortex street kim et al 2018a scholars used dense spheres to represent the sediment layer han et al 2018 kim and kang 2020 which required a significant computational load therefore porous media were applied to represent the sediment layer lee et al 2020 ren et al 2019 many studies utilized rans to calculate the overlying water and used darcy s law and continuity equation to compute the porous media cardenas and wilson 2007 yuan et al 2021 moreover they treated the swi as a nonslip boundary the overlying water and sediment were coupled through the pressure distribution on the sediment water interface swi based on the numerical simulation method above we made various improvements porous media were utilized to represent the sediment the sediment layer was divided into two zones by porosity namely a porous medium region with uniform porosity ϕ 0 and a transition region with porosity that varied from 1 to ϕ 0 as illustrated in fig 1c the interface of the transition zone and overlying water was set to the interior thereby ensuring the continuity of the velocity and stress table 1 shows the parameter settings of porous media and the flow velocity conditions of overlying water under different bed types based on the literature research in table 1 we set five inlet flow velocity conditions from 0 1 m s to 0 5 m s which were varied at intervals of 0 1 m s the sediment particle size in the porous media was selected as 5 mm and a total of 9 cases with porosities of 0 1 0 9 were considered with 0 1 interval variation which corresponded to nine bed permeabilities in the field thus the hydraulic conductivity k1 of the sediment layer studied in this paper ranged from 1 68 10 3 to 9 93 101 m s in addition the interface between the transition zone and the overlying water was set as a wall and five groups of incoming flow conditions were calculated accordingly we used the realizable k ε model to calculate the whole flow field the realizable k ε model is likely to provide superior performance for flows involving rotation boundary layers under strong adverse pressure gradients separation and recirculation it was assumed that the turbulence was isothermal and incompressible the

5 and η s k ε the model constants are c2 1 9 σ k 1 0 and σ ε 1 2 when calculating the sediment layer we enabled porous medium options and suppressed the effect of turbulence in the medium the porous medium was assumed to be homogeneous isotropic and saturated with a single phase fluid the model transported the turbulence quantities through the porous medium in addition the generation of turbulence was set to zero in the medium in essence only one momentum equation depicted the model containing the overlying water and sediment the source term for sediment layer in the eq 2 is expressed in eq 5 flow velocity within the porous medium can be modeled by the darcy s equation however the darcy s equation only simply characterizes linear seepage processes in porous mediums with the increase of fluctuations in the porous medium the seepage process might be nonlinear the inertia force term forchheimer term accounts for the deviation from linearity which is essential for large filtration velocity luo et al 2022 meanwhile the effective viscosity was introduced to assess the influence of the porous media on the diffusion term in the momentum equation here the brinkman correction was adopted to calculate the effective viscosity as expressed in eq 6 5 s i μ α v i c 3 1 2 ρ v v i in which si is the source term for the ith x y z momentum equation the first term on the right side of eq 5 is the viscous force term and the second term is the inertia force term μ is the dynamic viscosity coefficient pa s v is the velocity m s α represents the permeability m2 and c3 represents the inertia force term α and c3 can be obtained by the kozeny carman equation as presented in eq 7 and eq 8 respectively dp is the sediment particle size and ϕ is the porosity the darcy

overlying water were significantly changed if the thin transition layer between the overlying water and the homogeneous porous medium region is not considered the turbulence level near the swi will be overestimated kuwata and suga 2013 there is a transition zone in the sediment layer where the porosity changes from 1 to ϕ 0 referring to the research results of al aabidy et al 2020 the thickness of the transition region was set as 2dp and the porosity of the transition region was calculated by eq 10 10 ϕ ϕ 0 1 ϕ 0 exp 4 z 0 z d p where ϕ 0 is the porosity of the uniform porous medium and z0 represents the height of the swi 3 results 3 1 model validation the flume test results of gao et al 2021 and the direct numerical simulation results of breugem et al 2006 were verified both of which used the same model setting method as the above in addition we also changed some model settings for calculation such as the transition layer did not suppress the impact of turbulence and the entire sediment layer did not consider the inertia force term fig 2 illustrates the test flume and survey line arrangement in gao et al 2021 the thickness of the sediment layer was 0 2 m the median particle size of the sediment layer was 1 cm and the porosity was 0 3 it can reflect the applicability of the model in this paper when the hydraulic conductivity k1 is about 0 3 m s the experimental conditions with an average velocity u0 of 0 3 m s and an average water depth of 0 4 m above the swi were selected the simulated and measured values of the velocity and turbulence kinetic energy tke of typical survey lines along the vertical distribution are presented in fig 3 a and fig 3b respectively when using the model setting method in this paper the simulated velocity and turbulent kinetic energy are in satisfactory agreement with the measured values it is advisable to consider the inertial resistance term in the sediment layer simulation the velocity simulation results under the impermeable bed assumption differ significantly from the measured values near the swi the simulation results for the turbulence kinetic energy distribution under the impermeable bed assumption differ noticeably from the measured values moreover if the turbulence in the transition layer is not suppressed the calculated tke in the area near the swi differs significantly from the measured value to further validate the applicability of the model to various permeability conditions the model setting method was adopted in this paper to verify the direct numerical simulation results of breugem et al 2006 the experimental conditions with a spherical particle size of 0 53 cm and a porosity of 0 95 were selected it can represent the feasibility of the model in this paper when the bed permeability is pretty high fig 4 compares the results that were obtained using the four numerical simulation methods based on the comparison of velocity distribution and tke distribution the simulated values obtained by the proposed model setting method are in satisfactory agreement with dns results if the turbulence in the sediment layer is not suppressed the tke obtained by simulation has a significant deviation compared with the dns results moreover fig 5 shows the comparison between the calculation results of the model in this paper when the permeability is low and the results when the interface is impervious the simulation condition with an average velocity u0 of 0 3 m s and a porosity of 0 1 was selected the position of the measuring line was at x l 12 5 we can find that the two results are in good agreement in summary the model settings that are adopted in this paper are reasonable the treatments of the interface and the sediment layer are relatively accurate 3 2 flow field with traces and vorticity field referring to the results of zong and nepf 2012 we selected the area range of x l 7 5 25 l is the length of the vegetation patch which is 0 2 m to study the vegetation patch is located in the region of x l 10 11 fig 6 shows the flow fields in the study area under four typical simulation conditions and the same incoming flow conditions which are visually represented by traces a pressure difference is formed on the interface before and after the vegetation patch furthermore the pressure difference drives the exchange between the overlying water and the sediment layer the higher the bed permeability is the faster the exchange between the overlying water and sediment layer is and the higher the average velocity value in the sediment layer as the flow passes over the vegetation patch it creates an area of low pressure the pore water in the sediment layer flows from the low pressure area to the overlying water and the flow path is similar to the path of hyporheic exchange that is driven by the bed topography cardenas and wilson 2007 with increasing bed permeability the active exchange zone of the overlying water expands obviously along the vertical direction and the velocity near the swi increases when the bed permeability exceeds a threshold the positive vertical velocity above the swi on the downstream side of the vegetation patch increases and jet flow forms blois et al 2014 the longitudinal distribution of the pressure on the swi is shown in fig 7 when the bed permeability is low the pressure difference between the front and back of the patch is significant the pressure of the patch downstream gradually increases along the longitudinal direction and the active exchange area is concentrated in the patch area with increasing permeability the pressure difference before and after the patch decreases the pressure of the patch downstream gradually decreases along the longitudinal direction and the active exchange area expands along the flow direction the bed permeability determines the flow resistance in the sediment layer and changes the pressure distribution on the swi which affects the hccvps the simulation scenario that corresponds to re 9 104 was considered as an example there is an approximate rule that is similar to the above under different reynolds numbers vorticity originates from a velocity gradient in the flow field and is a kinematic physical quantity that describes swirling flow which plays a vital role in vortex motion fig 8 shows the y vorticity of the longitudinal section y 0 15 m under various bed permeability conditions when the bed permeability is low the viscous force near the swi induces a velocity gradient difference the y vorticity near the swi is large the vortex size is small and the vorticity of the overlying water far from the swi is small and uniform when the bed permeability exceeds a threshold a large vorticity in the area near the swi develops downward furthermore a jet flow forms on the downstream side of the vegetation patch and the flow turbulence intensifies which results in large scale whirlpools consequently the vorticity of the overlying water in the wake region increases 3 3 velocity distribution and turbulent kinetic energy distribution to further examine the hccvps differences under various bed permeability conditions the simulation scenario that corresponds to re 9 104 was considered as an example and the simulation results under other flow rates are presented in the supplementary data fig 9 illustrates the longitudinal distribution of the average velocity with depth the velocity in fig 9 refers to the average velocity between z h 0 and 1 at a specified point x on the longitudinal section y 0 15 m for the front area of the vegetation patch the higher the bed permeability is the lower the velocity is which is related to the exchange between the overlying water and the sediment the flow from the overlying water into the sediment layer is larger with higher bed permeability according to the research results of zong and nepf 2012 the area from the tail of the vegetation patch to the inflection point of the longitudinal distribution of the velocity can be preliminarily classified as a stable wake region the length of the stable wake zone is similar among the simulated conditions and the end of the stable wake zone is located near x l 20 interestingly when da 1 91 10 9 7 72 10 7 the longitudinal distribution of the velocity remains unchanged with changes in permeability when da is greater than 7 72 10 7 the velocity recovers faster to the level at the front of the patch with increasing bed permeability fig 10 shows the vertical distribution of the velocity on various survey lines located on the longitudinal section y 0 15 m we observe that the influence of the bed permeability on the velocity distribution in front of the vegetation patch is concentrated at z h 0 2 the main difference lies in the slip velocity when da 1 91 10 9 7 72 10 7 the vertical distribution of the velocity is very similar and the simulation scenario that corresponds to da 8 5 10 8 is represented here the bed permeability mainly affects the velocity distribution downstream of the vegetation patch when da is greater than 7 72 10 7 the velocity above the swi adjacent to the downstream patch decreases with increasing bed permeability the higher the bed permeability is the faster the velocity distribution in the karman vortex block recovers to the level in front of the vegetation patch the distribution of turbulent kinetic energy in the longitudinal section y 0 15 m is shown in fig 11 the bed permeability mainly affects the distribution of the turbulent energy downstream of the patch but not upstream on the downstream side of the patch the turbulent kinetic energy near the swi increases significantly when the bed permeability exceeds a threshold and the peak value of the turbulent kinetic energy increases and extends downstream with increasing bed permeability for the simulated condition with re 9 0 104 the da threshold is approximately 7 72 10 7 the longitudinal distribution of the turbulent kinetic energy is similar when da 1 91 10 9 2 74 10 7 when x l is 20 the turbulent kinetic energy near the swi is tiny thereby indicating that the position that corresponds to x l 20 is the end of the stable wake region in the karman vortex block the turbulent kinetic energy near the top of the overlying water decreases with increasing bed permeability 4 discussion 4 1 characterizing the hccvps changes by rek the analysis results in section 3 show that bed permeability affects mainly the flow structure downstream of the vegetation patch under the same incoming flow conditions the flow structure remains unchanged with changes in the bed permeability when it is less than a threshold value above this threshold the flow structure changes significantly with changes in the bed permeability although the darcy number can represent the bed permeability it is not easy to obtain a universal threshold in practical applications because it depends on the thickness h of the sediment layer the permeability reynolds number rek can represent the influence of the bed permeability breugem et al 2006 and consider the turbulent flow characteristics near the swi it is also a critical evaluation index for studying the turbulent characteristics at the swi grant et al 2018 and identifying the dominant mechanism of material transport and diffusion near the swi voermans et al 2017 which can be calculated by eq 11 it is more appropriate to obtain the threshold value of rek to characterize the threshold effect of the bed permeability as discussed above when rek is small the swi is approximately an impermeable wall whereas when rek is large the swi can be classified as a highly permeable bed surface a flow with a vegetation patch is generally divided into four partitions upstream of the patch the patch region the stable wake region and the karman vortex block according to the vorticity field typical velocity distribution and turbulence kinetic energy distribution near the swi the stable wake region changes more significantly with the bed permeability than other zones and its range is easier to obtain moreover the flow structure in the stable wake region plays an essential role in predicting patch expansion and sediment transport therefore the quantity rek that is adopted in this paper is the average permeability reynolds number in the stable wake region 11 r e k u k 1 2 υ where u is the friction velocity and the average turbulence kinetic energy of 0 1 h above the swi is used to estimate u k represents the actual permeability and can be approximated by α in the porous media here the range of the stable wake region that is used to estimate u is x l 12 5 20 and the turbulence in this region can be approximately considered to be generated by the bed surface stapleton and huntley 1995 in this equation u 0 19 t k e 1 2 the intervals of the rek thresholds that are related to hydraulic characteristics such as the velocity distribution and turbulent kinetic energy distribution in the wake area of the vegetation patch are listed in table 2 under the same incoming flow conditions rek increases with increasing da considering the simulation scenario that corresponds to re 9 0 104 as an example the interval of threshold da is 2 74 10 7 7 72 10 7 and the interval of corresponding threshold rek is 2 38 4 15 in general the rek threshold is of the magnitude of 1 as shown in table 2 when rek is lower than the threshold value the flow structure remains unchanged with changes in the bed permeability when rek is higher than the threshold value the flow structure changes with changes in the bed permeability 4 2 the magnitude and influencing factors of rek threshold the flow resistance of the vegetation is related to the hydrodynamic characteristics in the channel box et al 2021 mancheño et al 2021 the frictional resistance and shape resistance of the vegetation patch under various simulation conditions were extracted and the average drag coefficient cd of the stem in the vegetation patch was calculated using eq 12 the relationship between the average stem resistance and rek is shown in fig 12 the shaded part represents the magnitude of rek threshold i e rek o 1 when rek o 1 the flow resistance remains unchanged when rek o 1 the flow resistance decreases significantly with increasing rek the change degree of the flow resistance under the same inflow and different bed permeabilities can partially represent the change degree of the corresponding flow structure 12 f d 1 2 c d ρ a v u 0 2 where f d is the plant resistance a v is the characteristic reference area and u 0 is the mean velocity of the incoming flow we changed the vegetation density and set the distance d between adjacent stems to 0 1 m fig 13 shows the relationship between the flow resistance of the vegetation and rek at this density the rek threshold still is of the magnitude of 1 when rek o 1 the flow resistance remains unchanged when rek o 1 the flow resistance significantly decreases with increasing rek according to figs 12 and 13 when rek exceeds the threshold the slope of cd changing with rek is related to the velocity the red arrow shows the change of the rek threshold with the velocity the higher the velocity the higher the rek threshold we can infer from the slope of the red arrows that the rek threshold is related to the plant density and increases with increasing plant density under the same incoming flow velocity conditions suga et al 2017 found that low speed and high speed stripes that are similar to solid wall turbulence are observed near the wall when rek is small but when rek is large the observed turbulence structure differs significantly from that of a solid wall according to voermans et al 2017 when rek exceeds a threshold of approximately 1 2 the turbulent stress begins to dominate the shear stress at the swi the velocity conditions in voermans et al 2017 s study were 0 03 0 115 m s when the average velocity is 0 1 m s the rek threshold for two vegetation densities determined in this research is between 1 and 2 when describing solute transport diffusion a commonly used rek threshold is o 1 grant et al 2018 voermans et al 2018 turbulent diffusion is considered dominant when rek is greater than o 1 while molecular diffusion is dominant when rek is less than o 1 in conclusion the magnitude of rek threshold that corresponds to changes in the hydrodynamic characteristics in the wake area of the vegetation patch is consistent with that of previous studies without plants our results suggest that when rek is less than the threshold value of the corresponding conditions previous research results can approximate the hccvps and the methods that were used in previous studies to calculate flow resistance with vegetation are still valid however when we preliminarily judge that rek exceeds the critical threshold under corresponding conditions we should conduct experimental or numerical simulation research on the hydraulic characteristics and resistance characteristics of water flow with vegetation patches and utilize on site observations if possible 4 3 limitations of this study and the application of the results most patches grow on clay or sandy riverbeds with very low bed permeability at this point the hydrodynamic characteristics of surface water flow are little affected by groundwater the corresponding actual situations in this paper include gravelly channels containing emergent plant patches and channels containing multi layer plants the numerical simulation results can reflect the hydrodynamic characteristics of an isolated emergent plant patch strip with a permeable bed in a natural river system the interaction between vegetation patches de lima et al 2015 and the size of vegetation patches yu et al 2021 will change the hydrodynamic characteristics of the wake area however the magnitude of rek threshold obtained in this paper which represents the influence of bed permeability on the hydrodynamic characteristics in a channel with a vegetation patch is universal we used realizable k ε model to modeling the surface flow the rans model has been shown to have difficulty predicting increasingly complex or fine scale turbulence features models like detached eddy simulation des and large eddy simulation les were developed to depict the turbulent flow structure better rigid cylinders were used to represent emergent vegetation gu et al 2019 in previous studies this simplification was commonly utilized nevertheless the effects of leaves and branches on flow were ignored in our research the flexibility of the stems were neglected we can imagine that complex vegetation canopy can notably impact the turbulence structures and consequently lead to more complex flow pattern in the patch wake area caroppi et al 2022 moreover we assumed that the sediment was homogenous and essentially treated as a source term in the model thus the depiction of groundwater flow is not accurate enough furthermore we supposed that the stress was continuous at the swi and suppressed the turbulence near the swi however the bed roughness and the turbulent characteristics of some areas below the swi should be taken into account the stress jump conditions at the swi may be more appropriate de lemos 2005 in this paper we can obtain the hydrodynamic characteristics of overlying water comparatively accurately by setting the transition layer and applying the darcy brinkman forchheimer model in the sediment layer but the model can still be improved in the future in the study of flow in an area that is covered by vegetation patches more attention is given to sediment transport which impacts the habitat near the riverbed pomeroy et al 2017 when the bed permeability is low the velocity distribution and turbulent kinetic energy distribution of the permeable bed downstream of plant patches are close to those of the impermeable bed and sediment settlement easily occurs in the stable wake area when the bed permeability is high jet flows form on the downstream side adjacent to the plant patches and the turbulent kinetic energy near the swi is significantly increased the sediment does not easily settle and the riverbed may even experience erosion the accelerated flow near patch edges can reduce sediment deposition erode river channels and inhibit the lateral expansion of patches bouma et al 2009 follett and nepf 2012 in contrast the reduced velocity in the patch wake area can promote sediment deposition liu and shan 2019 provide shelter for the growth of new plants and promote the growth of patches along the direction of water flow chen et al 2012 yamasaki et al 2021 yamasaki et al 2019 predicted the expansion process of plant patches by selecting the velocity as the discriminant condition when the bed permeability is high and rek exceeds the threshold value the turbulence in the stable wake zone is enhanced it is no longer suitable to judge only according to velocity and a comprehensive evaluation should be carried out based on the shear stress of the bed this work serves as a starting point for future research 5 conclusions this paper used emergent rigid cylinders to represent a vegetation patch porous media were used to characterize sediment layers and the swi was treated as a permeable interface multiple groups of permeabilities were simulated and the following conclusions were drawn 1 the bed permeability determines the exchange area between the overlying water and the sediment layer changes the velocity and turbulent kinetic energy distributions near the swi and affects mainly the flow structure downstream of the vegetation patch 2 the permeability reynolds number rek can be used to determine the threshold effect of the bed permeability on the hydrodynamic characteristics in a channel with a vegetation patch when rek is less than the threshold value for the corresponding conditions the hccvps do not change with the bed permeability when rek is greater than the threshold value for the corresponding conditions the hccvps change significantly with the bed permeability a jet flow from the downstream side of the plant patch and the turbulent kinetic energy near the bed surface increases significantly in the wake region compared with that at low permeability 3 the rek threshold is related to the plant density and incoming flow velocity the magnitude of the rek threshold value that corresponds to the changes in hydrodynamic characteristics is 1 in practical applications when we preliminarily judge that rek is less than the critical threshold under corresponding conditions the hccvps approximately follow the results of previous research otherwise the hydraulic characteristics and resistance characteristics of water flow with vegetation patches should be tested or numerically simulated and field observations should be used if possible attention should also be focused on sediment transport patch expansion

3207,an accurate assessment of terrestrial ecosystem transpiration t is important to understand the vegetation atmosphere feedbacks under climate change solar induced chlorophyll fluorescence sif shows great potential to estimate t because of its mechanical linkage with photosynthesis and stomatal conductance however a global and spatially estimation of terrestrial t based on remotely sensed sif remains unresolved and novel strategies are challenged to entail a precise partition of t from evapotranspiration et across various biomes here with far red sif from sentinel 5 precursor satellite and ground observations for a total of 30 sites encompassing ten primary plant functional types pfts we extend a sif driven semi mechanism canopy conductance gc model for different plant functional types pfts and use the optimized penman monteith model pmopt to calculate t and t et we reveal that the relationship between sif and the product of gc and 0 5 power of vapor pressure deficit gc vpd0 5 is tighter than the relationship between sif and ecosystem productivity the sif gc vpd0 5 linear regressions show improved r2 and increased magnitude in slopes across pfts when aggregating daily to 16 day our t et results show high correlations with the results of the ball berry leuning model combined with pmopt at the site scale r2 0 69 and with the results calculated by leaf area index in a previous study at the pft scale 0 70 we further determine the global mean t et 0 57 0 14 close to the ensemble mean of global averaged t et 0 55 using 36 different methods the global t estimated using the sif based approach is compared with two other remote sensing products our method provides a valuable tool for t and et estimation using remote sensing data and is critical to understanding ecohydrological processes under climate change keywords evapotranspiration partitioning transpiration estimation solar induced chlorophyll fluorescence stomatal conductance penman monteith model 1 introduction terrestrial evapotranspiration et a fundamental component of the terrestrial ecosystem water cycle substantially influences climate change water availability and land surface energy balance milly et al 2005 trenberth et al 2009 zeng et al 2017 the proportion of global precipitation returning to the atmosphere via et is close to 60 higher in arid and semi arid zones mu et al 2011 different components of et interception evaporation i evaporation e and transpiration t react to climatic changes atmospheric composition and land use differently wei et al 2017 t is the primary component in et that involves soil moisture uptake from the root and water vapor loss through plant stomates schlesinger and jasechko 2014 as t is directly linked to photosynthesis via stomatal conductance gs it has long been acknowledged that quantification of t plays a crucial role in water resource management crop yield estimation water cycle and climate change however it is still challenging to partition et into its subcomponents at the regional and global scales significant variations in the ratio of t to et t et have been reported from 47 10 in the mediterranean shrubland with low leaf area index lai to 70 14 in the tropical rainforest with high lai schlesinger and jasechko 2014 wang et al 2014 global estimates of t et vary from 35 to 80 derived from different methods coenders gerrits et al 2014 the high uncertainties of et components partition hinder our understanding of et subcomponents authentic variation characteristics and their interactions in the carbon and water cycle of terrestrial ecosystems several methods for partitioning t from et have been used including direct and indirect methods from the plot to the ecosystem scale kool et al 2014 stoy et al 2019 at the plot scale these mainly include the sap flow method the gas exchange chambers method the micro lysimeter method and the isotopic method sun et al 2019 these approaches can only determine the t et within a limited range and would create considerable uncertainty when extrapolating to ecosystem scale kool et al 2014 ways for partitioning e and t at the ecosystem scale generally combine ecosystem scale observations with satellite based algorithms which can upscale e and t from ecosystem scale to regional or global scale these approaches include empirical models based on the relationship between lai and t et wang et al 2014 wei et al 2017 thermal imaging marshall et al 2016 water use efficiency wue combined with optimality theory assumption plants minimize water loss per unit carbon dioxide co2 gain nelson et al 2018 scott and biederman 2017 zhou et al 2016 flux variance similarity scanlon and kustas 2010 and conditional eddy covariance method zahn et al 2022 the first two methods that use leaf attributes of the ecosystem from satellite observations can capture the trend of t et over all ecosystems nevertheless there are still significant variations in t et among ecosystems when leaf attributes are comparable sun et al 2019 the latter two methods which rely on plant carbon water coupling characteristics can precisely partition t from et across all ecosystems however they require a reliable estimation of vegetation productivity gpp or canopy conductance gc especially when applied at the regional or global scales in conjunction with remote sensing techniques nelson et al 2020 remote sensing approaches have also been widely used in global et estimation wang and dickinson 2012 these approaches mainly contain 1 surface energy balance seb

including surface water balance and atmospheric water balance such as the wb with model tree ensemble wb mte developed by zeng et al 2014 3 penman monteith pm method such as the moderate resolution

gfet mte developed by jung et al 2010 and 8 assimilation method such as the north american land data assimilation system nldas developed by xia et al 2012 the common disadvantage of seb wb ts vi and mep is only available for clear sky the drawbacks of wb include its inability to compute gridded et values directly and its poor spatiotemporal resolution the simplification of physical processes is a restriction shared by both pt and eml pm can overcome these flaws after acquiring high quality meteorological forcing and improving the gc estimate zhang et al 2016a however gc is closely coupled with photosynthesis and improving estimations of gc needs optimizing gpp modelling spaceborne solar induced chlorophyll fluorescence sif has emerged as an essential technique for optimizing gpp estimation joiner et al 2011 li et al 2018 sun et al 2017 satellite sensors used for sif retrieval in terrestrial vegetation include the meteorological operational satellite global ozone monitoring experiment 2 sensor the orbiting carbon observatory the sentinel 5 precursor tropospheric monitoring instrument tropomi and other sensors mohammed et al 2019 tropomi observations offer an excellent spatial and temporal resolution which improves global estimates of gpp over previous satellite sif data zhang et al 2019c sif has been used to estimate gc and t because it has a tight physical relationship with gpp damm et al 2018 lu et al 2018 maes et al 2020 pagan et al 2019 shan et al 2019 the sif t connection is dominated by air temperature and intrinsic wue maes et al 2020 and also is affected by photosynthetically active radiation par vapor pressure deficit vpd and lai lu et al 2018 moreover sif based t retrieval models including a wue based model and a conductance based model have been constructed from the standpoint of plant physiology feng et al 2021 shan et al 2021 these sif based models perform well at the site scale however these sif based models are challenged to apply for quantifying t et and to employ in different ecosystems on the global scale the main objective of this study is to quantify t et on the global scale by using the sif constrained gc model specifically we aim to 1 develop a plant functional type pft specific sif driven semi mechanism gc model denoted as gc sif model 2 partition et across different pfts worldwide combing the pm equation and sif

sif data denoted as gcsif see 2 3 2 for details third gcsite and gcsif combined with the optimized pm model pmopt were used to calculate t denoted as tsite and tsif respectively for all sites see 2 3

terrestrial t was obtained using the gc sif model and the pmopt as well as sif and other relevant data at a 16 day temporal resolution represented as daily global t estimation finally the global t estimates were compared to current state of the art t estimates such as gleam and pml v2 a detailed flowchart for data processing is shown in fig 1 2 2 dataset 2 2 1 far red sif data from tropomi sif from the sentinel 5 precursor satellite was retrieved by using a singular value decomposition technique in the window of 743 758 nm and normalized to the sif at 740 nm köhler et al 2018 it was almost

february 2018 to july 2019 to avoid cloud impacts we first filtered out the original sif with cloud fractions 0 2 second the instantaneous sif was transformed to daily means using the day length correction factor before our investigation frankenberg et al 2011 the daily mean sif for each site was determined as the average of all available observations within a 10 km radius buffer centered by the site location which can well capture the footprint of ec flux fig a1 the ungridded daily mean sif was aggregated to 0 1 0 1 gridded daily sif data to estimate global t during the 2018 growing season the 16 day sif was further aggregated by averaging daily mean sif ungridded and gridded over the 16 days when data was available for at least five days 2 2 2 ec flux dataset we collected a total of 30 ec flux sites after checking the availability of data to match the period of sif distributed over america europe australia and china fig 2 and table a1 and all these sites have data

a standard processing was carried out for the original flux data including u filtering gap filling and flux partitioning wutzler et al 2018 specifically a day time carbon flux partitioning algorithm was used for calculating gpp lasslop et al 2010 second measured data without gap filling was employed in this study except for standard processing of flux data third half hourly data were averaged into hourly data to standardize the calculation process fourth observations with negative rn gpp le and vpd were eliminated fifth we used day time observations from 6 00 to 18 00 data availability after quality control is given in table a2 at each site in this study daily values were computed only for days with at least 8 measured hour measurements and 16 day values were calculated only for the 16 days with at least 3 recorded day measurements 2 2 3 era5 land data for the global t estimation we used the fifth european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf reanalysis for land hourly dataset era5 land as auxiliary data which is the latest global land surface climate reanalysis dataset with 0 1 0 1 resolution ecmwf 2017 the uncertainty of era5 land was defined by the ensemble of

were obtained from google earth engine gee modis collection 6 products from february 2018 to july 2019 the mcd15a3h 006 lai and fpar i e fraction of par absorbed by vegetation dataset myneni et al 2015 have a spatial resolution of 500 m and a temporal resolution of 4 day which were used to calculate gcsite the mcd12q1 006 land cover dataset at 500 m spatial resolution is annual land cover types friedl et al 2010 and the year 2018 was used in this study the international geosphere biosphere programme classification scheme was used to provide pft specific information the mod16a2 006 et dataset in 2018 was applied to magnify t et from pft to global mu et al 2011 a savitzky golay filter was utilized for each pixel to eliminate noise contaminations for lai and fpar data savitzky and golay 1964 the quality control was checked using the quality assurance layer and pixels not contaminated by clouds and aerosols were selected as reliable observations the lai and fpar around each flux tower site were extracted by averaging all available observations within a 1 km radius around the site location to estimate t for different pfts the land cover data was aggregated to 0 1 0 1 resolution by counting the proportions of different land cover types in each grid from the original 500 m resolution and the dominant biome type was assigned to this 0 1 0 1 grid cell similarly the lai and fpar datasets were also aggregated to 0 1 0 1 resolution to keep the spatial resolution consistent with all other datasets 2 2 5 gleam data and pml v2 data gleam and pml v2 are widely used remote sensed products of et retrieved by pt and pm which have dataset of different et components when this study is in progress gleam and pml v2 are available from 2018 to 2019 thus the gleam v3 3b data miralles et al 2011 martens et al 2017 and the pml v2 data zhang et al 2019a were compared to validate our estimation of t in this study the daily gleam data was available from https www gleam eu and provided on a 0 25 0 25 latitude longitude grid the pml v2 data was collected from gee with a spatial resolution of 500 m and a temporal resolution of 8 day the gleam data of each flux tower site was directly extracted by its location the pml v2 data of each flux tower site was extracted by the same strategies as modis lai data the gleam data were linearly interpolated to 0 1 0 1 resolution and the pml v2 data were averagely aggregated to 0 1 0 1 resolution to compare their spatial patterns with our results 2 3 methods 2 3 1 gc estimation we used the bbl model a modified version of the ball berry model to estimate hourly leaf gs and then gc was obtained within a big leaf model framework sellers et al 1992 the bbl model is a biochemical model characterizing plants carbon water coupling processes in which gs is expressed as a function of environmental parameters and net assimilation rate a n leuning 1995 lohammer et al 1980 the bbl model was given as follows 6 g s 1 6 m a n c s γ 1 d s d 0 g 0 where g s was in unit of m s 1 or mol m 2 s 1 a n was in unit of μmol m 2 s 1 c s was co2 at the leaf surface ppm γ was the co2 compensation point ppm which was set to 40 for c3 plants and 2 for c4 grassland d s was humidity deficit at the leaf surface kpa d 0 was set to 0 35 as an empirically fitted parameter representing the sensitivity of stomata to changes in d s kpa leuning 1995 m and g0 were the slope and minimum conductance calculated from empirical data provided in table 1 respectively the unit of g s was converted from mol m 2 s 1 to m s 1 after a multiplication of the coefficient v m v m was calculated according to the following equation 7 v m 8 314 t air 273 15 1000 p finally we replaced g0 with a multiplication of lai and g0 gpp with a n atmosphere co2 with c s and vpd with d s to upscale all parameters from leaf to canopy scale different gc models have little influence on the results of gc after we compared the daily mean stomatal conductance calculated by the bbl model and the ball berry medlyn model bbm fig a2 lin et al 2015 medlyn et al 2011 2 3 2 the gc sif model development and calibration shan et al 2021 developed a sif driven semi mechanism gc model combining theories on the photosynthetic pathway and optimal stomatal behavior and validated by hourly canopy sif and concurrent eddy covariance flux observations at both forest and crop ecosystems the form of this model was expressed as follows 8 g c vpd 0 5 a s i f b where sif was in mw m 2 nm 1 sr 1 a and b were the slope and intercept which provided the constraint for the relationships between gc and sif for each pft we extended this model to 10 different pfts worldwide using least squares regression and repeated k fold cross validation at the 16 day temporal resolution we repeated 4 times k fold cross validation for each pft with k value of 10 the results for each pft including model slope model intercept mean square error mse root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae and goodness of fit r2 were computed by averaging the results of all the repeated k fold cross validation 2 3 3 transpiration estimation the pm equation was used to estimate t the original pm equation and relevant formulas were as follows 9 le δ r n g ρ a c p v p d r a δ γ 1 r s r a 10 δ 4098 17 e sat t air 237 3 2 11 ρ a 28 9654 p e sat d e w 18 016 e sat d e w 8 314 273 15 t air 12 c p 1005 1 0 622 e sat d e

pressure temperature relationship in kpa c 1 ρ a was the mean air density at constant pressure in kg m 3 c p was the specific heat of the air in j kg 1 c 1 r a was the aerodynamic resistance in s m 1 γ is the psychrometric constant in kpa c 1 r s was the surface resistance in s m 1 and g s was the surface conductance in m s 1 or mol m 2 s 1 the pm equation was originally used to calculate et and was modified to determine t after considering energy distribution between dry and wet surfaces energy preferred evaporating liquid water on the wet surface similar to the parallel circuit system since the evaporation resistance of the wet surface was considerably lower than that of dry surface as illustrated in fig 3 moreover g s had to be substituted with gc while calculating t as a result the pmopt equation for calculating t was as follows 16 λ t 1 f wet δ r n g ρ a c p v p d r a δ γ 1 1 g c r a 17 f wet 0 0 r h 70 rh 4 70 r h 100 where λ t was the latent heat flux from t in w m 2 λ was the latent heat of vaporization 2 45 mj kg 1 f wet was the wet surface fraction from the fisher et al 2008 et model fisher et al 2008 all abbreviations are listed in supplemental table b1 2 3 4 comparison with previous t et estimations first t et estimated from both the bbl model and the gc sif model were evaluated using the pearson correlation analysis at the site scale second we used correlation analysis to examine the relationship between our tsif et finding and prior multi site t et results collected by wei et al 2017 wei et al 2017 collected the values of t e i et and pft type from 64 individual ground sties since these ground sites are different from the sites in our study we can only compare our results with wei s results at pft scale third to further explore the performance of our gc sif model we estimated the global mean tsif et of terrestrial ecosystem for the 2018 growing season using tsif et values at the pft scale and the method from schlesinger and jasechko 2014 combined with modis ecozone et mu et al 2011 and land cover product friedl et al 2010 table 3 finally we compared our global tsif et result to t et values using other methodologies reported in the previous literature 3 results 3 1 calibration and validation of the gc sif model we first examined the relationship between sif and both gpp and gcsite vpd0 5 for all sites over the growing season at both daily and 16 day temporal scale fig 4 in general the linear relationship can be observed between daily sif and gpp with r2 of 0 50 fig 4a the sif gpp relationship presents an increasing linearity and an improvement after aggregating from daily to 16 days r2 increased to 0 56 fig 4b for the majority of sites sif shows significantly positive correlations with gpp p 0 05 21 out of 30 sites at the 16 day temporal scale table a3 and the mean site based r between sif and gpp is 0 62 the correlation between gcsite vpd0 5 and sif is less scattered and more linear compared with the sif gpp relationship with an improved r2 of 0 69 for daily scale fig 4c and r2 of 0 76 for 16 day temporal scales fig 4d for all sites at the individual site 23 of 30 sites demonstrate significant p 0 05 associations between sif and gcsite vpd0 5 table a3 the mean site based r between sif and gcsite vpd0 5 is 0 48 most of these sites 12 19 sites show a stronger linear correlation between sif and gcsite vpd0 5 than between sif and gpp in short the relationship between sif and gcsite vpd0 5 at the 16 day scale is strongest among these four relationships we further explored the performance of the sif gcsite vpd0 5 linear regressions at both daily and 16 day scales for each biome fig 5 the regression models vary significantly across pfts and the r2 ranges from 0 03 for osh to 0 6 for grac4 at daily scale the regressions show improved r2 r2 ranges from 0 28 for osh to 0 83 for grac4 and increased magnitude in slopes across pfts when aggregating daily to 16 day correlations between 16 day sif and gcsite vpd0 5 are generally high r 0 75 for grac4 csh wsa sav enf mf and dbf ebf but low 0 75 r 0 5 for gra as well as osh according to the significant correlation between sif and gcsite vpd0 5 we calculated the slope and intercept per pft in the gc sif model table 2 the results show that the slopes of csh and osh are the greatest and lowest respectively the best performance of the model was observed for grac4 r2 0 88 while the worst was obtained for osh r2 0 41 similar to r2 between sif and gcsite vpd0 5 the model slopes for gra and osh are lower than those for other pfts finally the values of a and b in the gc sif model across different pfts are obtained 3 2 t et comparation tsif et at the site scale was calculated using the simulated tsif and the observed et fig 6 tsif et ratio is the greatest for mf 0 90 which is limited to a single site the lowest tsif et ratio is for gra 0 39 dbf is the pft with the second greatest tsif et 0 85 for individual sites the fr pue ebf site has the highest tsif et 0 98 of all the sites while the lowest tsif et value 0 30 is seen at the cn xil gra site interestingly for evergreen forests enf s mean tsif et 0 78 is close to that of ebf 0 78 due to a high vegetation coverage for csh an average tsif et ratio of 0 78 is observed the mean tsif et values in wsa sav and osh are 0 65 0 69 and 0 57 respectively moreover there is a substantial difference in the tsif et for c3 grasslands and c4 grasslands with different co2 assimilation pathways with grac3 having a mean tsif et value of 0 39 and grac4 having a mean tsif et value of 0 73 both the bbl model fig a3 and the gc sif model provide comparable t et values for pfts but the ranking of tsite et for pfts with high vegetation coverage is not entirely consistent mf ebf dbf csh grac4 enf wsa sav osh gra tsite et is highly correlated with tsif et r2 0 69p 0 001 fig 7 a in addition our tsif et values were further compared with the t et values from wei et al 2017 using data from earlier research fig 7b the r2 between our pft mean tsif et values and pft mean t et from wei et al 2017 is 0 70 a significant correlation p 0 037 the r2 for pft median value is 0 86 p 0 08 these two comparative studies demonstrate the potential of the gc sif model in tsif et estimation across a wide variety of pfts gra has the lowest mean and median t et values while forests including enf dbf and ebf the last two are referred to bf have the highest mean and median t et values sav wsa and shrublands osh and csh all have mean and median t et values around 0 6 with a large standard deviation but pattern of the mean t et values for sav wsa and shrublands are different in our results than in wei s results in a word our tsif et values are well validated by tsite et and t et from wei et al 2017 to further explore the performance of our gc sif model we estimated the global mean tsif et of terrestrial ecosystem for the 2018 growing season using tsif et values at the pft scale and the method from schlesinger and jasechko 2014 combined with modis et and landcover product table 3 our growing season global mean tsif et value is 0 57 0 14 global mean t et values calculated by different methods vary from 0 24 to 0 86 whereas our result falls within this range and close to their mean value global mean t et values computed using climate models isotopes lai based models remote sensing models and wue based models are 0 50 0 60 0 59 0 61 and 0 62 the uncertainties measured as standard deviation sd also vary widely across models ranging from 0 03 to 0 33 while our global tsif et has an sd of 0 14 moreover we evaluated the global mean t et 0 55 0 07 for 2018 using pml v2 data thus our growing season global mean tsif et value is comparable to the average of global mean t et values from other methods 3 3 global t estimation with the gc sif model our t estimates based on the gc sif model were compared to those from gleam and pml v2 products at the site scale fig 8 et simulated by pml v2 and gleam are strongly correlated with et measured from ec flux tower with the r values of 0 85 and 0 79 the correlations between the t from pml v2 and both tsite and tsif are more significant than those between the et from pml v2 and the et from the flux tower while the correlations between the t from gleam and both tsite and tsif are less than those between the et from gleam and the et from the flux tower moreover for most sites the t estimated by gleam is higher than tsite and tsif the global spatial pattern of the average daily tsif for the 2018 growing season is shown in fig 9 the daily mean tsif value varies between 0 and 3 mm day 1 globally fig 9 the growing season mean tsif shows the high values tsif 1 5 mm day 1 in the tropical rain forest area including the amazon basin and the congo river basins and the temperate broad leaved forest area including southeastern united states southern europe and southern china the intermediate tsif values range from 0 8 mm day 1 to 1 5 mm day 1 in the crop area e g central united states sahel area central and eastern europe south asia and eastern china and the enf area e g southern canada northern europe and northeastern china the low values tsif 0 8 mm day 1 are in the arid and semi arid areas as well as the areas with high latitude and altitude which are characterized by sparse vegetation our global tsif mapping can exhibit the spatial pattern of terrestrial ecosystem t globally which is consistent with the current global t estimates this consistency is simultaneously confirmed by the strong correlation with the pml v2 product r2 0 61 rmse 0 60 mm day 1 and the gleam product r2 0 56 rmse 0 75 mm day 1 on a per pixel basis fig 10 in most places the magnitudes of t from gleam products are higher than our results the t of pml v2 product exceeds our findings only in the areas with high t intensity t 1 5 mm day 1 mostly distributed in the tropics in the arid and semi arid areas as well as some crop areas the t of pml v2 and gleam products is lower than our results 4 discussion accurate assessment of the contribution of t to et is critical for understanding terrestrial ecosystem carbon and water cycle good et al 2015 wei et al 2018 this study constructed a gc sif model to simulate gc and t based on satellite sif data the model is used to estimate the global mean t et and t values for the growing season of the year 2018 4 1 influencing factors of partitioning t from et based on sif our study shows that sif links closely with gpp at different temporal scales fig 4 consistent with previous findings guanter et al 2014 yang et al 2015 the mechanic linkage between photosynthesis and sif provides a valuable opportunity to estimate t since gpp and t are coupled through stomatal function stoy et al 2019 however sif cannot directly and exclusively estimate t owing to the impact of confounding factors such as micro meteorological conditions plant physiological characteristics and canopy structure damm et al 2018 maes et al 2020 a lucubration of the sif t relationship prompts researchers to develop two techniques for t retrieval via sif including the sif gc empirical relationship based model shan et al 2019 and the mechanism model feng et al 2021 shan et al 2021 we adopt the mechanism framework proposed by shan et al 2021 to connect sif with gc eq 8 this framework is a semi mechanistic model for estimating gc by combining theories on the photosynthetic pathway and optimal stomatal behavior the results indicate that the relationship between sif and gc vpd0 5 has improved performance over that between sif and gpp fig 4 accounting for the enhancement of vpd on the correlation of sif gc with an increase in vpd the stomatal closure reduces the diffusion of co2 into the mesophyll causing imbalances between carboxylation and the harvest of light then reduces gpp and sif paul limoges et al 2018 other mechanism models suggest that vpd may also optimize t retrieval through sif feng et al 2021 since vpd is a key parameter in the pm model and contributes to the explanation of large variability in the sif t relationship at the ecosystem scale jonard et al 2020 considering that the sif gc vpd0 5 connection varies with pfts shan et al 2021 we calculated the model parameters a and b of the equation for each pfts fig 5 and table 2 we find that the model slope of grac4 is much greater than that of gra which might be attributed to different photosynthetic strategies of c3 and c4 plants table 2 this may be because the gpp of c4 plants is more sensitive to sif than that of c3 plants li et al 2018 liu et al 2017 and c3 plants are more likely to exhibit a positive et response than c4 plants massmann et al 2019 different pfts within c3 plants differ in sif lai and response to stress and water stress stability in forests is much larger than in grasslands isbell et al 2015 zhang et al 2019c as a result a calibration of the gc sif model is also required for independent pfts of c3 plants our results show that the sif gc vpd0 5 correlations are relatively weak in gra and osh because gpp sif and vpd in these pfts with low vegetation coverage are generally more vulnerable to environmental factors the lower model slopes in these pfts are probably due to a lower m value in the bbl model table 1 the m value varied among pfts especially for forests due to the possibility that the big leaf model applied in forests with a high lai generally underestimates gpp sprintsin et al 2012 the precipitation interception process has an important effect on the accuracy of t partitioning from et the inaccurate description of the interception process is one of the major reasons for the general underestimate of t et by climate models lian et al 2018 in addition the large difference in t et values from two isotope methods reported are mainly due to the disparate interception evaporation fluxes they used good et al 2015 jasechko et al 2013 as for pm mod model previous studies indicate its interception evaporation is much greater than that from other global et products i e gleam and pt jpl miralles et al 2016 this is because the rs of the wet canopy is underestimated in the pm mod model yue et al 2021 zhang et al 2019a in this study our treatment of i is partially consistent with the pm mod model by distinguishing wet and dry surfaces but we simply remove the energy of interception evaporation independent of the resistance implying that our treatment of the interception process has less effect on the partitioning of t from et moreover our results show that the correlation between sif and gc vpd0 5 is more robust at a coarser temporal scale figs 4 5 which is similar to previous works on the more linear relationship between gpp and sif from short to longer time scales frankenberg et al 2011 yang et al 2017 this temporal aggregation effect is also observed in the sif t relationship in the temperate forest ecosystem lu et al 2018 which suggests that both sif and gc vpd0 5 are sensitive to other environmental factors in different ways 4 2 comparison with other independent et partitioning products we compare t et across different pfts at the site scale and find a trend toward a higher t et for pfts with higher vegetation coverage figs 6 7 this trend coincides with the nonlinear relationship between t et and lai found by wang et al 2014 and wei et al 2017 however this trend has been challenged in high lai ecosystems with a close t et value 0 78 for enf and ebf figs 6 7 the underlying mechanism is that more precipitation interception of broad leaved forests results in an increased i than that of coniferous forests during the growing season van dijk et al 2015 for grasslands significant differences in t et are observed between our study and wei et al 2017 primarily derived from photosynthetic pathways the t et of grac3 is much lower than that of grac4 fig 6 compared with grac3 grac4 has a very low γ and can sustain photosynthesis with very low gc under conditions of high atmospheric water demand and limited water availability brooks and farquhar 1985 this may cause c4 plants to maintain low gc and t and to continue emitting sif under water stress our study and wei et al 2017 indicate that the t et for sav wsa and shrublands osh and csh is about 0 6 with a large standard deviation fig 7 statistically the large standard deviation is due to the small sample size and the occurrence of outliers fig 7 the large standard deviation causes the pft mean pattern of sav wsa and shrublands to be opposite to the pft median pattern and the pft median pattern is in line with wei et al 2017 if using more sites in the future comparison it is expected the discrepancy of pft mean pattern in t et ratio for sav wsa and shrublands between our and wei s results may not exist ecologically the large standard deviation may be because in sav wsa and shrublands surface landscape heterogeneity affects the fraction of absorbed par by leaves and further eco hydrological processes particularly t kobayashi et al 2012 besides the large standard deviation may also be due to the distinct patterns of carbon water coupling between herbaceous and woody plants in sav wsa and shrublands wei et al 2017 moreover sav wsa and shrublands are usually vegetated sparsely which may result in a situation where e predominates over t we collected the results of global mean t et derived from 36 different methods table 3 the estimated global mean t et is 50 for most methods our global mean t et value of 0 57 closes to the ensemble mean of global t et 0 549 from these different methods climate models generally underestimate the global mean t et due to the inaccuracies in their representation of canopy light use and root water uptake processes lian et al 2018 hydrological processes based climate models such as parflow clm maxwell and condon 2016 and t c fatichi and pappas 2017 generally calculate a greater t et than the other models global mean t et values derived from isotopes lai based models remote sensing models and wue based models are all around 0 6 which are slightly higher than our results the lower value in our study may be because we compare t et on different timescales growing season with sufficient precipitation generally leads to an increased i and hence a drop in t et particularly for forests the lower t et in our study may also be a consequence of the neglect of the impact of c4 plants and crops when upscaling t et to the global terrestrial ecosystem they generally have a greater t et value than c3 plants the greater t et achieved using isotope method may be due to the significant uncertainties of isotopic ratios under weak turbulence conditions wei et al 2015 or the overestimation of t in cases of hydrologic decoupling brooks et al 2010 the greater t et value derived using lai based model especially the method of wang et al 2014 is most likely attributed to the inadequacy of the statistical method used to calculate global average which is simply an arithmetic average of all observations the global per pixel calculation method wei et al 2017 and the weighted average method this study schlesinger and jasechko 2014 are more acceptable there are two possible explanations for the greater t et value calculated by li et al 2019 in the wue based model the statistical method used and the omission of i when compared to remote sensing models our method produces comparable global mean t et values as pt jpt and pml v2 whereas gleam pml and gerrits s model generate larger global mean t et values and pm mod has a lower global mean t et value gleam and gerrits s model have approximate estimation of t and et mianabadi et al 2019 a comparative study finds that pt jpt is the closest to the actual t et value while gleam pm mod overestimates underestimates t et based on field observations talsma et al 2018 another reason for underestimating t et by pm mod is that it significantly overestimates i as shown in section 4 1 gleam substantially underestimates soil evaporation but slightly overestimates t resulting in a high accuracy of et estimates talsma et al 2018 this perspective coincides with our findings that the t estimates in gleam are systematically greater than our global simulations figs 8 10 the most possible reason why pml has a larger global mean t et value than our result is that pml overestimate t since the gc of pml is calculated through empirical equations based on lai and par without considering water and heat stresses leuning et al 2008 thus based on pml the pml v2 optimizes the original gc module into the ball berry model with carbon water coupling characteristics gan et al 2018 the pml v2 has been proved to perform better in estimating gpp and et zhang et al 2019b the estimation of t illustrates that our result is consistent with pml v2 at the site scale fig 8 nevertheless when compared to pml v2 our global patterns of t indicate that it is larger in the tropics and lower in the drylands fig 10 the explanation may include the following aspects 1 the relationship between sif and the modeled gpp varies in these two regions 2 we estimate t by treating c4 plants as c3 plants 3 the available energy for t in our model is different from pml v2 4 3 implications and limitations our study may have important implications for assessing regional and global water flux under climate change this new framework reveals that satellite sif may be utilized to precisely estimate t et and monitor the spatio temporal variations in terrestrial t at the regional and global scale combined with meteorological data figs 7 9 the t et value calculated using sif can help to resolve whether t et is constrained by vegetation characteristics and environmental factors fatichi and pappas 2017 niu et al 2019 paschalis et al 2018 wei et al 2017 in addition previous empirical techniques employing vegetation indexes or lai can produce t but hardly capture the temporal variations of t since they are limited to environmental conditions and ecosystems zhang et al 2016a our sif based approach is useful to resolve this shortcoming because sif is more sensitive than other remotely sensed vegetation parameters to plant photosynthetic and water heat stresses song et al 2018 yoshida et al 2015 a remotely sensed et model with better performance can be developed in association with appropriate remote sensing models for i and e this could be used to improve the simulation accuracy of the global water and energy cycle however there are still some limitations in this study first our method may be inapplicable in the condition of carbon water decoupling for example forests may decouple photosynthesis and t in response to heat extremes and sufficient water availability de kauwe et al 2019 the trade off between leaf water potential regulation and stomatal behavior may influence the effect of vpd on the sif gc relationship martinez vilalta and garcia forner 2017 second the classification of pfts is inadequate and needs further refined the remote sensing methods for t retrieval such as pm mod generally divide the global ecosystem into 11 or more pfts mu et al 2011 our model examines 10 pfts and did not distinguish crops or wetlands moreover we do not consider the proportion of c4 grasslands in our global t simulation due to lack of accurate global map of c4 plants even though we have developed models for c4 grasslands third the validation of our model may be limited by the source of validated data while we validated our results from satellite sif data using ec flux tower and other remote sensing products the flux tower t et is achieved by simulation not by independent field measurements such as the isotope method 5 conclusion our results show that sif has a stronger relationship with gc vpd0 5 than gpp and the sif gc vpd0 5 linear regression at the 16 day scale are tighter and sharper than at the daily scale based on the regression we developed the sif driven semi mechanism gc model on various pfts and use the pmopt model to calculate t and t et correlations between tsif et and t et values from other independent techniques are excellent at both site and global scale after the implementation of our gc sif model we estimate the global mean t et of the terrestrial ecosystem for growing season in 2018 0 57 0 14 that is close to the mean t et value 0 55 of the current models from other 36 methods ultimately we simulate global t for the 2018 growing season at the resolution of 0 1 0 1 and compare it to two commonly used remote sensing retrieval products our model provides a valuable complement to remote sensing based t and et retrieval and has critical implications for assessing eco hydrological processes under climate change more consideration about condition of carbon water decoupling different pfts and source

3207,an accurate assessment of terrestrial ecosystem transpiration t is important to understand the vegetation atmosphere feedbacks under climate change solar induced chlorophyll fluorescence sif shows great potential to estimate t because of its mechanical linkage with photosynthesis and stomatal conductance however a global and spatially estimation of terrestrial t based on remotely sensed sif remains unresolved and novel strategies are challenged to entail a precise partition of t from evapotranspiration et across various biomes here with far red sif from sentinel 5 precursor satellite and ground observations for a total of 30 sites encompassing ten primary plant functional types pfts we extend a sif driven semi mechanism canopy conductance gc model for different plant functional types pfts and use the optimized penman monteith model pmopt to calculate t and t et we reveal that the relationship between sif and the product of gc and 0 5 power of vapor pressure deficit gc vpd0 5 is tighter than the relationship between sif and ecosystem productivity the sif gc vpd0 5 linear regressions show improved r2 and increased magnitude in slopes across pfts when aggregating daily to 16 day our t et results show high correlations with the results of the ball berry leuning model combined with pmopt at the site scale r2 0 69 and with the results calculated by leaf area index in a previous study at the pft scale 0 70 we further determine the global mean t et 0 57 0 14 close to the ensemble mean of global averaged t et 0 55 using 36 different methods the global t estimated using the sif based approach is compared with two other remote sensing products our method provides a valuable tool for t and et estimation using remote sensing data and is critical to understanding ecohydrological processes under climate change keywords evapotranspiration partitioning transpiration estimation solar induced chlorophyll fluorescence stomatal conductance penman monteith model 1 introduction terrestrial evapotranspiration et a fundamental component of the terrestrial ecosystem water cycle substantially influences climate change water availability and land surface energy balance milly et al 2005 trenberth et al 2009 zeng et al 2017 the proportion of global precipitation returning to the atmosphere via et is close to 60 higher in arid and semi arid zones mu et al 2011 different components of et interception evaporation i evaporation e and transpiration t react to climatic changes atmospheric composition and land use differently wei et al 2017 t is the primary component in et that involves soil moisture uptake from the root and water vapor loss through plant stomates schlesinger and jasechko 2014 as t is directly linked to photosynthesis via stomatal conductance gs it has long been acknowledged that quantification of t plays a crucial role in water resource management crop yield estimation water cycle and climate change however it is still challenging to partition et into its subcomponents at the regional and global scales significant variations in the ratio of t to et t et have been reported from 47 10 in the mediterranean shrubland with low leaf area index lai to 70 14 in the tropical rainforest with high lai schlesinger and jasechko 2014 wang et al 2014 global estimates of t et vary from 35 to 80 derived from different methods coenders gerrits et al 2014 the high uncertainties of et components partition hinder our understanding of et subcomponents authentic variation characteristics and their interactions in the carbon and water cycle of terrestrial ecosystems several methods for partitioning t from et have been used including direct and indirect methods from the plot to the ecosystem scale kool et al 2014 stoy et al 2019 at the plot scale these mainly include the sap flow method the gas exchange chambers method the micro lysimeter method and the isotopic method sun et al 2019 these approaches can only determine the t et within a limited range and would create considerable uncertainty when extrapolating to ecosystem scale kool et al 2014 ways for partitioning e and t at the ecosystem scale generally combine ecosystem scale observations with satellite based algorithms which can upscale e and t from ecosystem scale to regional or global scale these approaches include empirical models based on the relationship between lai and t et wang et al 2014 wei et al 2017 thermal imaging marshall et al 2016 water use efficiency wue combined with optimality theory assumption plants minimize water loss per unit carbon dioxide co2 gain nelson et al 2018 scott and biederman 2017 zhou et al 2016 flux variance similarity scanlon and kustas 2010 and conditional eddy covariance method zahn et al 2022 the first two methods that use leaf attributes of the ecosystem from satellite observations can capture the trend of t et over all ecosystems nevertheless there are still significant variations in t et among ecosystems when leaf attributes are comparable sun et al 2019 the latter two methods which rely on plant carbon water coupling characteristics can precisely partition t from et across all ecosystems however they require a reliable estimation of vegetation productivity gpp or canopy conductance gc especially when applied at the regional or global scales in conjunction with remote sensing techniques nelson et al 2020 remote sensing approaches have also been widely used in global et estimation wang and dickinson 2012 these approaches mainly contain 1 surface energy balance seb based method including single source seb model and dual source seb model such as the operational simplified surface energy balance ssebop developed by senay et al 2013 2 water balance wb based method including surface water balance and atmospheric water balance such as the wb with model tree ensemble wb mte developed by zeng et al 2014 3 penman monteith pm method such as the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis et product pm mod developed by mu et al 2011 and the penman monteith leuning model pml and pml v2 developed by zhang et al 2016b 2019b 4 priestley taylor pt method such as the global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam developed by martens et al 2017 5 surface temperature vegetation index space ts vi method such as the surface energy balance system sebs developed by su 2002 6 maximum entropy production method mep applied to global estimation by huang et al 2017 7 empirical or machine learning eml method such as the gridded fluxnet et with model tree ensemble gfet mte developed by jung et al 2010 and 8 assimilation method such as the north american land data assimilation system nldas developed by xia et al 2012 the common disadvantage of seb wb ts vi and mep is only available for clear sky the drawbacks of wb include its inability to compute gridded et values directly and its poor spatiotemporal resolution the simplification of physical processes is a restriction shared by both pt and eml pm can overcome these flaws after acquiring high quality meteorological forcing and improving the gc estimate zhang et al 2016a however gc is closely coupled with photosynthesis and improving estimations of gc needs optimizing gpp modelling spaceborne solar induced chlorophyll fluorescence sif has emerged as an essential technique for optimizing gpp estimation joiner et al 2011 li et al 2018 sun et al 2017 satellite sensors used for sif retrieval in terrestrial vegetation include the meteorological operational satellite global ozone monitoring experiment 2 sensor the orbiting carbon observatory the sentinel 5 precursor tropospheric monitoring instrument tropomi and other sensors mohammed et al 2019 tropomi observations offer an excellent spatial and temporal resolution which improves global estimates of gpp over previous satellite sif data zhang et al 2019c sif has been used to estimate gc and t because it has a tight physical relationship with gpp damm et al 2018 lu et al 2018 maes et al 2020 pagan et al 2019 shan et al 2019 the sif t connection is dominated by air temperature and intrinsic wue maes et al 2020 and also is affected by photosynthetically active radiation par vapor pressure deficit vpd and lai lu et al 2018 moreover sif based t retrieval models including a wue based model and a conductance based model have been constructed from the standpoint of plant physiology feng et al 2021 shan et al 2021 these sif based models perform well at the site scale however these sif based models are challenged to apply for quantifying t et and to employ in different ecosystems on the global scale the main objective of this study is to quantify t et on the global scale by using the sif constrained gc model specifically we aim to 1 develop a plant functional type pft specific sif driven semi mechanism gc model denoted as gc sif model 2 partition et across different pfts worldwide combing the pm equation and sif constrained gc 3 apply the gc sif model to global t estimation in the 2018 growing season 2 materials and methods 2 1 workflow first we calculated gc at 30 eddy covariance ec flux tower sites using the ball berry leuning bbl model denoted as gcsite covering ten different pfts see 2 3 1 for details second gcsite was used to calculate and validate the gc sif model and simulate gc based on tropomi sif data denoted as gcsif see 2 3 2 for details third gcsite and gcsif combined with the optimized pm model pmopt were used to calculate t denoted as tsite and tsif respectively for all sites see 2 3 3 for details fourth the results of tsif and tsif et were compared to previous studies at the ecosystem scale and on the global scale see 2 3 4 for details fifth a global and spatial estimation of terrestrial t was obtained using the gc sif model and the pmopt as well as sif and other relevant data at a 16 day temporal resolution represented as daily global t estimation finally the global t estimates were compared to current state of the art t estimates such as gleam and pml v2 a detailed flowchart for data processing is shown in fig 1 2 2 dataset 2 2 1 far red sif data from tropomi sif from the sentinel 5 precursor satellite was retrieved by using a singular value decomposition technique in the window of 743 758 nm and normalized to the sif at 740 nm köhler et al 2018 it was almost daily continuous global coverage with a spatial resolution of 7 km 3 5 km at the nadir and 7 km 14 5 km at the edge of the swath it was available from february 2018 and our study period ran from february 2018 to july 2019 to avoid cloud impacts we first filtered out the original sif with cloud fractions 0 2 second the instantaneous sif was transformed to daily means using the day length correction factor before our investigation frankenberg et al 2011 the daily mean sif for each site was determined as the average of all available observations within a 10 km radius buffer centered by the site location which can well capture the footprint of ec flux fig a1 the ungridded daily mean sif was aggregated to 0 1 0 1 gridded daily sif data to estimate global t during the 2018 growing season the 16 day sif was further aggregated by averaging daily mean sif ungridded and gridded over the 16 days when data was available for at least five days 2 2 2 ec flux dataset we collected a total of 30 ec flux sites after checking the availability of data to match the period of sif distributed over america europe australia and china fig 2 and table a1 and all these sites have data records covering at least one entire growing season from february 2018 to july 2019 the growing season was defined as the five consecutive months with the highest ecosystem productivity in a year as determined by a multi year average of the recent five years the 30 flux sites contain 10 different pfts comprising 3 evergreen needle forests enf sites 3 evergreen broadleaf forests ebf sites 3 deciduous broadleaf forests dbf sites 1 mixed forest mf site 3 closed shrublands csh sites 4 open shrublands osh sites 3 woody savannas wsa sites 3 savannas sav sites 4 c3 grasslands gra sites 3 c4 grasslands grac4 sites flux data and relevant auxiliary data were available at ameriflux https ameriflux lbl gov european eddy fluxes database cluster https www europe fluxdata eu ozflux https data

auxiliary data contained net radiation rn unit w m 2 surface pressure p unit kpa 2 m temperature tair unit c soil temperature unit c co2 concentration co2 unit parts per million ppm friction velocity u unit m s 1 wind speed u unit m s 1 canopy height hc unit m measurement height hm unit m and air relative humidity rh unitless if rn was not directly available rn was calculated by the following formula 1 r n r ns r nl r s r s r l r l where r ns r nl r s r s r l r l were surface net solar radiation surface net thermal radiation downward solar radiation upward solar radiation downward thermal radiation and upward thermal radiation in w m 2 respectively vpd could substitute for rh because rh and tair were used to compute vpd by tetens s formula 2 vpd e sat 1 r h 3 e sat 0 61078 e 17 27 t air t air 237 3 where vpd was in kpa and esat is saturated vapour pressure in kpa the following processes aimed to make a rigorous quality check to identify reliable half hour flux observations first a standard processing was carried out for the original flux data including u filtering gap filling and flux partitioning wutzler et al 2018 specifically a day time carbon flux partitioning algorithm was used for calculating gpp lasslop et al 2010 second measured data without gap filling was employed in this study except for standard processing of flux data third half hourly data were averaged into hourly data to standardize the calculation process fourth observations with negative rn gpp le and vpd were eliminated fifth we used day time observations from 6 00 to 18 00 data availability after quality control is given in table a2 at each site in this study daily values were computed only for days with at least 8 measured hour measurements and 16 day values were calculated only for the 16 days with at least 3 recorded day measurements 2 2 3 era5 land data for the global t estimation we used the fifth european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf reanalysis for land hourly dataset era5 land as auxiliary data which is the latest global land surface climate reanalysis dataset with 0 1 0 1 resolution ecmwf 2017 the uncertainty of era5 land was defined by the ensemble of data assimilations system which confirms that the data was reliable from february 2018 to july 2019 the hourly era5 land variables used in this study included tair unit k 2 m dewpoint temperature tdew unit k r ns unit j m 2 r nl unit j m 2 and p unit pa the units of all variables were converted to be consistent with the site flux dataset the tdew was used to calculate the vpd in kpa by the

in kpa rn was calculated by the eq 1 data with negative rn and vpd was excluded the hourly data was aggregated to daily data by averaging day time data from 6 00 to 18 00 2 2 4 modis data modis data were obtained from google earth engine gee modis collection 6 products from february 2018 to july 2019 the mcd15a3h 006 lai and fpar i e fraction of par absorbed by vegetation dataset myneni et al 2015 have a spatial resolution of 500 m and a temporal resolution of 4 day which were used to calculate gcsite the mcd12q1 006 land cover dataset at 500 m spatial resolution is annual land cover types friedl et al 2010 and the year 2018 was used in this study the international geosphere biosphere programme classification scheme was used to provide pft specific information the mod16a2 006 et dataset in 2018 was applied to magnify t et from pft to global mu et al 2011 a savitzky golay filter was utilized for each pixel to eliminate noise contaminations for lai and fpar data savitzky and golay 1964 the quality control was checked using the quality assurance layer and pixels not contaminated by clouds and aerosols were selected as reliable observations the lai and fpar around each flux tower site were extracted by averaging all available observations within a 1 km radius around the site location to estimate t for different pfts the land cover data was aggregated to 0 1 0 1 resolution by counting the proportions of different land cover types in each grid from the original 500 m resolution and the dominant biome type was assigned to this 0 1 0 1 grid cell similarly the lai and fpar datasets were also aggregated to 0 1 0 1 resolution to keep the spatial resolution consistent with all other datasets 2 2 5 gleam data and pml v2 data gleam and pml v2 are widely used remote sensed products of et retrieved by pt and pm which have dataset of different et components when this study is in progress gleam and pml v2 are available from 2018 to 2019 thus the gleam v3 3b data miralles et al 2011 martens et al 2017 and the pml v2 data zhang et al 2019a were compared to validate our estimation of t in this study the daily gleam data was available from https www gleam eu and provided on a 0 25 0 25 latitude longitude grid the pml v2 data was collected from gee with a spatial resolution of 500 m and a temporal resolution of 8 day the gleam data of each flux tower site was directly extracted by its location the pml v2 data of each flux tower site was extracted by the same strategies as modis lai data the gleam data were linearly interpolated to 0 1 0 1 resolution and the pml v2 data were averagely aggregated to 0 1 0 1 resolution to compare their spatial patterns with our results 2 3 methods 2 3 1 gc estimation we used the bbl model a modified version of the ball berry model to estimate hourly leaf gs and then gc was obtained within a big leaf model framework sellers et al 1992 the bbl model is a biochemical model characterizing plants carbon water coupling processes in which gs is expressed as a function of environmental parameters and net assimilation rate a n leuning 1995 lohammer et al 1980 the bbl model was given as follows 6 g s 1 6 m a n c s γ 1 d s d 0 g 0 where g s was in unit of m s 1 or mol m 2 s 1 a n was in unit of μmol m 2 s 1 c s was co2 at the leaf surface ppm γ was the co2 compensation point ppm which was set to 40 for c3 plants and 2 for c4 grassland d s was humidity deficit at the leaf surface kpa d 0 was set to 0 35 as an empirically fitted parameter representing the sensitivity of stomata to changes in d s kpa leuning 1995 m and g0 were the slope and minimum conductance calculated from empirical data provided in table 1 respectively the unit of g s was converted from mol m 2 s 1 to m s 1 after a multiplication of the coefficient v m v m was calculated according to the following equation 7 v m 8 314 t air 273 15 1000 p finally we replaced g0 with a multiplication of lai and g0 gpp with a n atmosphere co2 with c s and vpd with d s to upscale all parameters from leaf to canopy scale different gc models have little influence on the results of gc after we compared the daily mean stomatal conductance calculated by the bbl model and the ball berry medlyn model bbm fig a2 lin et al 2015 medlyn et al 2011 2 3 2 the gc sif model development and calibration shan et al 2021 developed a sif driven semi mechanism gc model combining theories on the photosynthetic pathway and optimal stomatal behavior and validated by hourly canopy sif and concurrent eddy covariance flux observations at both forest and crop ecosystems the form of this model was expressed as follows 8 g c vpd 0 5 a s i f b where sif was in mw m 2 nm 1 sr 1 a and b were the slope and intercept which provided the constraint for the relationships between gc and sif for each pft we extended this model to 10 different pfts worldwide using least squares regression and repeated k fold cross validation at the 16 day temporal resolution we repeated 4 times k fold cross validation for each pft with k value of 10 the results for each pft including model slope model intercept mean square error mse root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae and goodness of fit r2 were computed by averaging the results of all the repeated k fold cross validation 2 3 3 transpiration estimation the pm equation was used to estimate t the original pm equation and relevant formulas were as follows 9 le δ r n g ρ a c p v p d r a δ γ 1 r s r a 10 δ 4098 17 e sat t air 237 3 2 11 ρ a 28 9654 p e sat d e w 18 016 e sat d e w 8 314 273 15 t air 12 c p 1005 1 0 622 e sat d e

pressure temperature relationship in kpa c 1 ρ a was the mean air density at constant pressure in kg m 3 c p was the specific heat of the air in j kg 1 c 1 r a was the aerodynamic resistance in s m 1 γ is the psychrometric constant in kpa c 1 r s was the surface resistance in s m 1 and g s was the surface conductance in m s 1 or mol m 2 s 1 the pm equation was originally used to calculate et and was modified to determine t after considering energy distribution between dry and wet surfaces energy preferred evaporating liquid water on the wet surface similar to the parallel circuit system since the evaporation resistance of the wet surface was considerably lower than that of dry surface as illustrated in fig 3 moreover g s had to be substituted with gc while calculating t as a result the pmopt equation for calculating t was as follows 16 λ t 1 f wet δ r n g ρ a c p v p d r a δ γ 1 1 g c r a 17 f wet 0 0 r h 70 rh 4 70 r h 100 where λ t was the latent heat flux from t in w m 2 λ was the latent heat of vaporization 2 45 mj kg 1 f wet was the wet surface fraction from the fisher et al 2008 et model fisher et al 2008 all abbreviations are listed in supplemental table b1 2 3 4 comparison with previous t et estimations first t et estimated from both the bbl model and the gc sif model were evaluated using the pearson correlation analysis at the site scale second we used correlation analysis to examine the relationship between our tsif et finding and prior multi site t et results collected by wei et al 2017 wei et al 2017 collected the values of t e i et and pft type from 64 individual ground sties since these ground sites are different from the sites in our study we can only compare our results with wei s results at pft scale third to further explore the performance of our gc sif model we estimated the global mean tsif et of terrestrial ecosystem for the 2018 growing season using tsif et values at the pft scale and the method from schlesinger and jasechko 2014 combined with modis ecozone et mu et al 2011 and land cover product friedl et al 2010 table 3 finally we compared our global tsif et result to t et values using other methodologies reported in the previous literature 3 results 3 1 calibration and validation of the gc sif model we first examined the relationship between sif and both gpp and gcsite vpd0 5 for all sites over the growing season at both daily and 16 day temporal scale fig 4 in general the linear relationship can be observed between daily sif and gpp with r2 of 0 50 fig 4a the sif gpp relationship presents an increasing linearity and an improvement after aggregating from daily to 16 days r2 increased to 0 56 fig 4b for the majority of sites sif shows significantly positive correlations with gpp p 0 05 21 out of 30 sites at the 16 day temporal scale table a3 and the mean site based r between sif and gpp is 0 62 the correlation between gcsite vpd0 5 and sif is less scattered and more linear compared with the sif gpp relationship with an improved r2 of 0 69 for daily scale fig 4c and r2 of 0 76 for 16 day temporal scales fig 4d for all sites at the individual site 23 of 30 sites demonstrate significant p 0 05 associations between sif and gcsite vpd0 5 table a3 the mean site based r between sif and gcsite vpd0 5 is 0 48 most of these sites 12 19 sites show a stronger linear correlation between sif and gcsite vpd0 5 than between sif and gpp in short the relationship between sif and gcsite vpd0 5 at the 16 day scale is strongest among these four relationships we further explored the performance of the sif gcsite vpd0 5 linear regressions at both daily and 16 day scales for each biome fig 5 the regression models vary significantly across pfts and the r2 ranges from 0 03 for osh to 0 6 for grac4 at daily scale the regressions show improved r2 r2 ranges from 0 28 for osh to 0 83 for grac4 and increased magnitude in slopes across pfts when aggregating daily to 16 day correlations between 16 day sif and gcsite vpd0 5 are generally high r 0 75 for grac4 csh wsa sav enf mf and dbf ebf but low 0 75 r 0 5 for gra as well as osh according to the significant correlation between sif and gcsite vpd0 5 we calculated the slope and intercept per pft in the gc sif model table 2 the results show that the slopes of csh and osh are the greatest and lowest respectively the best performance of the model was observed for grac4 r2 0 88 while the worst was obtained for osh r2 0 41 similar to r2 between sif and gcsite vpd0 5 the model slopes for gra and osh are lower than those for other pfts finally the values of a and b in the gc sif model across different pfts are obtained 3 2 t et comparation tsif et at the site scale was calculated using the simulated tsif and the observed et fig 6 tsif et ratio is the greatest for mf 0 90 which is limited to a single site the lowest tsif et ratio is for gra 0 39 dbf is the pft with the second greatest tsif et 0 85 for individual sites the fr pue ebf site has the highest tsif et 0 98 of all the sites while the lowest tsif et value 0 30 is seen at the cn xil gra site interestingly for evergreen forests enf s mean tsif et 0 78 is close to that of ebf 0 78 due to a high vegetation coverage for csh an average tsif et ratio of 0 78 is observed the mean tsif et values in wsa sav and osh are 0 65 0 69 and 0 57 respectively moreover there is a substantial difference in the tsif et for c3 grasslands and c4 grasslands with different co2 assimilation pathways with grac3 having a mean tsif et value of 0 39 and grac4 having a mean tsif et value of 0 73 both the bbl model fig a3 and the gc sif model provide comparable t et values for pfts but the ranking of tsite et for pfts with high vegetation coverage is not entirely consistent mf ebf dbf csh grac4 enf wsa sav osh gra tsite et is highly correlated with tsif et r2 0 69p 0 001 fig 7 a in addition our tsif et values were further compared with the t et values from wei et al 2017 using data from earlier research fig 7b the r2 between our pft mean tsif et values and pft mean t et from wei et al 2017 is 0 70 a significant correlation p 0 037 the r2 for pft median value is 0 86 p 0 08 these two comparative studies demonstrate the potential of the gc sif model in tsif et estimation across a wide variety of pfts gra has the lowest mean and median t et values while forests including enf dbf and ebf the last two are referred to bf have the highest mean and median t et values sav wsa and shrublands osh and csh all have mean and median t et values around 0 6 with a large standard deviation but pattern of the mean t et values for sav wsa and shrublands are different in our results than in wei s results in a word our tsif et values are well validated by tsite et and t et from wei et al 2017 to further explore the performance of our gc sif model we estimated the global mean tsif et of terrestrial ecosystem for the 2018 growing season using tsif et values at the pft scale and the method from schlesinger and jasechko 2014 combined with modis et and landcover product table 3 our growing season global mean tsif et value is 0 57 0 14 global mean t et values calculated by different methods vary from 0 24 to 0 86 whereas our result falls within this range and close to their mean value global mean t et values computed using climate models isotopes lai based models remote sensing models and wue based models are 0 50 0 60 0 59 0 61 and 0 62 the uncertainties measured as standard deviation sd also vary widely across models ranging from 0 03 to 0 33 while our global tsif et has an sd of 0 14 moreover we evaluated the global mean t et 0 55 0 07 for 2018 using pml v2 data thus our growing season global mean tsif et value is comparable to the average of global mean t et values from other methods 3 3 global t estimation with the gc sif model our t estimates based on the gc sif model were compared to those from gleam and pml v2 products at the site scale fig 8 et simulated by pml v2 and gleam are strongly correlated with et measured from ec flux tower with the r values of 0 85 and 0 79 the correlations between the t from pml v2 and both tsite and tsif are more significant than those between the et from pml v2 and the et from the flux tower while the correlations between the t from gleam and both tsite and tsif are less than those between the et from gleam and the et from the flux tower moreover for most sites the t estimated by gleam is higher than tsite and tsif the global spatial pattern of the average daily tsif for the 2018 growing season is shown in fig 9 the daily mean tsif value varies between 0 and 3 mm day 1 globally fig 9 the growing season mean tsif shows the high values tsif 1 5 mm day 1

china the intermediate tsif values range from 0 8 mm day 1 to 1 5 mm day 1 in the crop area e g central united states sahel area central and eastern europe south asia and eastern china and the enf area e g southern canada northern europe and northeastern china the low values tsif 0 8 mm day 1 are in the arid and semi arid areas as well as the areas with high latitude and altitude which are characterized by sparse vegetation our global tsif mapping can exhibit the spatial pattern of terrestrial ecosystem t globally which is consistent with the current global t estimates this consistency is simultaneously confirmed by the strong correlation with the pml v2 product r2 0 61 rmse 0 60 mm day 1 and the gleam product r2 0 56 rmse 0 75 mm day 1 on a per pixel basis fig 10 in most places the magnitudes of t from gleam products are higher than our results the t of pml v2 product exceeds our findings only in the areas with high t intensity t 1 5 mm day 1 mostly distributed in the tropics in the arid and semi arid areas as well as some crop areas the t of pml v2 and gleam products is lower than our results 4 discussion accurate assessment of the contribution of t to et is critical for understanding terrestrial ecosystem carbon and water cycle good et al 2015 wei et al 2018 this study constructed a gc sif model to simulate gc and t based on satellite sif data the model is used to estimate the global mean t et and t values for the growing season of the year 2018 4 1 influencing factors of partitioning t from et based on sif our study shows that sif links closely with gpp at different temporal scales fig 4 consistent with previous findings guanter et al 2014 yang et al 2015 the mechanic linkage between photosynthesis and sif provides a valuable opportunity to estimate t since gpp and t are coupled through stomatal function stoy et al 2019 however sif cannot directly and exclusively estimate t owing to the impact of confounding factors such as micro meteorological conditions plant physiological characteristics and canopy structure damm et al 2018 maes et al 2020 a lucubration of the sif t relationship prompts researchers to develop two techniques for t retrieval via sif including the sif gc empirical relationship based model shan et al 2019 and the mechanism model feng et al 2021 shan et al 2021 we adopt the mechanism framework proposed by shan et al 2021 to connect sif with gc eq 8 this framework is a semi mechanistic model for estimating gc by combining theories on the photosynthetic pathway and optimal stomatal behavior the results indicate that the relationship between sif and gc vpd0 5 has improved performance over that between sif and gpp fig 4 accounting for the enhancement of vpd on the correlation of sif gc with an increase in vpd the stomatal closure reduces the diffusion of co2 into the mesophyll causing imbalances between carboxylation and the harvest of light then reduces gpp and sif paul limoges et al 2018 other mechanism models suggest that vpd may also optimize t retrieval through sif feng et al 2021 since vpd is a key parameter in the pm model and contributes to the explanation of large variability in the sif t relationship at the ecosystem scale jonard et al 2020 considering that the sif gc vpd0 5 connection varies with pfts shan et al 2021 we calculated the model parameters a and b of the equation for each pfts fig 5 and table 2 we find that the model slope of grac4 is much greater than that of gra which might be attributed to different photosynthetic strategies of c3 and c4 plants table 2 this may be because the gpp of c4 plants is more sensitive to sif than that of c3 plants li et al 2018 liu et al 2017 and c3 plants are more likely to exhibit a positive et response than c4 plants massmann et al 2019 different pfts within c3 plants differ in sif lai and response to stress and water stress stability in forests is much larger than in grasslands isbell et al 2015 zhang et al 2019c as a result a calibration of the gc sif model is also required for independent pfts of c3 plants our results show that the sif gc vpd0 5 correlations are relatively weak in gra and osh because gpp sif and vpd in these pfts with low vegetation coverage are generally more vulnerable to environmental factors the lower model slopes in these pfts are probably due to a lower m value in the bbl model table 1 the m value varied among pfts especially for forests due to the possibility that the big leaf model applied in forests with a high lai generally underestimates gpp sprintsin et al 2012 the precipitation interception process has an important effect on the accuracy of t partitioning from et the inaccurate description of the interception process is one of the major reasons for the general underestimate of t et by climate models lian et al 2018 in addition the large difference in t et values from two isotope methods reported are mainly due to the disparate interception evaporation fluxes they used good et al 2015 jasechko et al 2013 as for pm mod model previous studies indicate its interception evaporation is much greater than that from other global et products i e gleam and pt jpl miralles et al 2016 this is because the rs of the wet canopy is underestimated in the pm mod model yue et al 2021 zhang et al 2019a in this study our treatment of i is partially consistent with the pm mod model by distinguishing wet and dry surfaces but we simply remove the energy of interception evaporation independent of the resistance implying that our treatment of the interception process has less effect on the partitioning of t from et moreover our results show that the correlation between sif and gc vpd0 5 is more robust at a coarser temporal scale figs 4 5 which is similar to previous works on the more linear relationship between gpp and sif from short to longer time scales frankenberg et al 2011 yang et al 2017 this temporal aggregation effect is also observed in the sif t relationship in the temperate forest ecosystem lu et al 2018 which suggests that both sif and gc vpd0 5 are sensitive to other environmental factors in different ways 4 2 comparison with other independent et partitioning products we compare t et across different pfts at the site scale and find a trend toward a higher t et for pfts with higher vegetation coverage figs 6 7 this trend coincides with the nonlinear relationship between t et and lai found by wang et al 2014 and wei et al 2017 however this trend has been challenged in high lai ecosystems with a close t et value 0 78 for enf and ebf figs 6 7 the underlying mechanism is that more precipitation interception of broad leaved forests results in an increased i than that of coniferous forests during the growing season van dijk et al 2015 for grasslands significant differences in t et are observed between our study and wei et al 2017 primarily derived from photosynthetic pathways the t et of grac3 is much lower than that of grac4 fig 6 compared with grac3 grac4 has a very low γ and can sustain photosynthesis with very low gc under conditions of high atmospheric water demand and limited water availability brooks and farquhar 1985 this may cause c4 plants to maintain low gc and t and to continue emitting sif under water stress our study and wei et al 2017 indicate that the t et for sav wsa and shrublands osh and csh is about 0 6 with a large standard deviation fig 7 statistically the large standard deviation is due to the small sample size and the occurrence of outliers fig 7 the large standard deviation causes the pft mean pattern of sav wsa and shrublands to be opposite to the pft median pattern and the pft median pattern is in line with wei et al 2017 if using more sites in the future comparison it is expected the discrepancy of pft mean pattern in t et ratio for sav wsa and shrublands between our and wei s results may not exist ecologically the large standard deviation may be because in sav wsa and shrublands surface landscape heterogeneity affects the fraction of absorbed par by leaves and further eco hydrological processes particularly t kobayashi et al 2012 besides the large standard deviation may also be due to the distinct patterns of carbon water coupling between herbaceous and woody plants in sav wsa and shrublands wei et al 2017 moreover sav wsa and shrublands are usually vegetated sparsely which may result in a situation where e predominates over t we collected the results of global mean t et derived from 36 different methods table 3 the estimated global mean t et is 50 for most methods our global mean t et value of 0 57 closes to the ensemble mean of global t et 0 549 from these different methods climate models generally underestimate the global mean t et due to the inaccuracies in their representation of canopy light use and root water uptake processes lian et al 2018 hydrological processes based climate models such as parflow clm maxwell and condon 2016 and t c fatichi and pappas 2017 generally calculate a greater t et than the other models global mean t et values derived from isotopes lai based models remote sensing models and wue based models are all around 0 6 which are slightly higher than our results the lower value in our study may be because we compare t et on different timescales growing season with sufficient precipitation generally leads to an increased i and hence a drop in t et particularly for forests the lower t et in our study may also be a consequence of the neglect of the impact of c4 plants and crops when upscaling t et to the global terrestrial ecosystem they generally have a greater t et value than c3 plants the greater t et achieved using isotope method may be due to the significant uncertainties of isotopic ratios under weak turbulence conditions wei et al 2015 or the overestimation of t in cases of hydrologic decoupling brooks et al 2010 the greater t et value derived using lai based model especially the method of wang et al 2014 is most likely attributed to the inadequacy of the statistical method used to calculate global average which is simply an arithmetic average of all observations the global per pixel calculation method wei et al 2017 and the weighted average method this study schlesinger and jasechko 2014 are more acceptable there are two possible explanations for the greater t et value calculated by li et al 2019 in the wue based model the statistical method used and the omission of i when compared to remote sensing models our method produces comparable global mean t et values as pt jpt and pml v2 whereas gleam pml and gerrits s model generate larger global mean t et values and pm mod has a lower global mean t et value gleam and gerrits s model have approximate estimation of t and et mianabadi et al 2019 a comparative study finds that pt jpt is the closest to the actual t et value while gleam pm mod overestimates underestimates t et based on field observations talsma et al 2018 another reason for underestimating t et by pm mod is that it significantly overestimates i as shown in section 4 1 gleam substantially underestimates soil evaporation but slightly overestimates t resulting in a high accuracy of et estimates talsma et al 2018 this perspective coincides with our findings that the t estimates in gleam are systematically greater than our global simulations figs 8 10 the most possible reason why pml has a larger global mean t et value than our result is that pml overestimate t since the gc of pml is calculated through empirical equations based on lai and par without considering water and heat stresses leuning et al 2008 thus based on pml the pml v2 optimizes the original gc module into the ball berry model with carbon water coupling characteristics gan et al 2018 the pml v2 has been proved to perform better in estimating gpp and et zhang et al 2019b the estimation of t illustrates that our result is consistent with pml v2 at the site scale fig 8 nevertheless when compared to pml v2 our global patterns of t indicate that it is larger in the tropics and lower in the drylands fig 10 the explanation may include the following aspects 1 the relationship between sif and the modeled gpp varies in these two regions 2 we estimate t by treating c4 plants as c3 plants 3 the available energy for t in our model is different from pml v2 4 3 implications and limitations our study may have important implications for assessing regional and global water flux under climate change this new framework reveals that satellite sif may be utilized to precisely estimate t et and monitor the spatio temporal variations in terrestrial t at the regional and global scale combined with meteorological data figs 7 9 the t et value calculated using sif can help to resolve whether t et is constrained by vegetation characteristics and environmental factors fatichi and pappas 2017 niu et al 2019 paschalis et al 2018 wei et al 2017 in addition previous empirical techniques employing vegetation indexes or lai can produce t but hardly capture the temporal variations of t since they are limited to environmental conditions and ecosystems zhang et al 2016a our sif based approach is useful to resolve this shortcoming because sif is more sensitive than other remotely sensed vegetation parameters to plant photosynthetic and water heat stresses song et al 2018 yoshida et al 2015 a remotely sensed et model with better performance can be developed in association with appropriate remote sensing models for i and e this could be used to improve the simulation accuracy of the global water and energy cycle however there are still some limitations in this study first our method may be inapplicable in the condition of carbon water decoupling for example forests may decouple photosynthesis and t in response to heat extremes and sufficient water availability de kauwe et al 2019 the trade off between leaf water potential regulation and stomatal behavior may influence the effect of vpd on the sif gc relationship martinez vilalta and garcia forner 2017 second the classification of pfts is inadequate and needs further refined the remote sensing methods for t retrieval such as pm mod generally divide the global ecosystem into 11 or more pfts mu et al 2011 our model examines 10 pfts and did not distinguish crops or wetlands moreover we do not consider the proportion of c4 grasslands in our global t simulation due to lack of accurate global map of c4 plants even though we have developed models for c4 grasslands third the validation of our model may be limited by the source of validated data while we validated our results from satellite sif data using ec flux tower and other remote sensing products the flux tower t et is achieved by simulation not by independent field measurements such as the isotope method 5 conclusion our results show that sif has a stronger relationship with gc vpd0 5 than gpp and the sif gc vpd0 5 linear regression at the 16 day scale are tighter and sharper than at the daily scale based on the regression we developed the sif driven semi mechanism gc model on various pfts and use the pmopt model to calculate t and t et correlations between tsif et and t et values from other independent techniques are excellent at both site and global scale after the implementation of our gc sif model we estimate the global mean t et of the terrestrial ecosystem for growing season in 2018 0 57 0 14 that is close to the mean t et value 0 55 of the current models from other 36 methods ultimately we simulate global t for the 2018 growing season at the resolution of 0 1 0 1 and compare it to two commonly used remote sensing retrieval products our model provides a valuable complement to remote sensing based t and et retrieval and has critical implications for assessing eco hydrological processes under climate change more consideration about condition of carbon water decoupling different pfts and source

3208,infiltration and associated soil hydraulic properties such as field saturated hydraulic conductivity kfs sorptivity s or saturated soil water content θs are measured after wildland fires to assess risks of water related hazards and water supply impairment yet the statistical power of these data to distinguish between burned and unburned infiltration is seldom assessed despite the typically small number of total measurements n here parametric and nonparametric statistical approaches are used to assess the primary influences on the statistical power and whether the n is sufficient to achieve a representative power of 0 9 about half of the studies examined did not achieve a power 0 9 at the as sampled n suggesting the need for post fire infiltration studies to collect more measurements effect size was the primary control on power and therefore the n needed to achieve a given power because effect size tends to decrease with time since fire n generally needs to increase with time since fire in infiltration studies power estimates were similar for parametric and nonparametric analyses comparisons between infiltration methods suggested that steady state rainfall simulation produced a greater power for a given n relative to both tension infiltrometers and constant or falling head permeameters the greater power of the steady state rainfall simulation method was the result of smaller variability compared to the tension infiltrometers and constant or falling head permeameters the substantial variability of post fire tension infiltrometer measurements may complicate using these data in meta analyses this work further suggests that synthesis or meta analysis studies of post fire soil hydraulic properties may be more robust if data are weighted by statistical power the differences in statistical power between infiltration measurement methods require further demonstration for a broader range of datasets before extrapolation beyond the datasets considered here keywords number of samples wildfire hydraulic properties statistical power hydraulic conductivity sorptivity 1 introduction infiltration is one of the most common

ebel et al 2012 nyman et al 2010 further examination of the review of infiltration studies and associated kfs estimates from ebel 2019 shows that different measurement methods also exhibit kfs differences in measurement variability as quantified by the coefficient of variation cv defined as the standard deviation normalized by the mean fig 1 a for example tension infiltrometer kfs had a median cv of 1 32 and constant or falling head permeameter kfs had a median cv of 0 19 whereas steady state rainfall simulation kfs had a median of cv of 0 32 fig 1a the fire science community is still investigating the significance of these potential differences in variability between infiltration measurement methods however we know from prior work in unburned conditions that increased soil variability can complicate measurement efforts e g mader 1963 because of disparities between methods in the time needed to prepare and complete infiltration measurements these different methods typically do not conduct the same number of measurements n with the more time consuming simulated rainfall measurements often having a smaller n fig 1b the number of measurements of infiltration needed to discern differences between burned and unburned soil conditions is crucial information regardless of the measurement method used or the scale of characterization confidence in assessing infiltration differences resulting from wildland fire can be quantified by knowing the statistical power associated with a given n or by selecting n to achieve a desired power post fire infiltration measurement studies typically collect a small n because of limited site access the potentially long duration of individual infiltration measurements and financial constraints fig 1b in the post fire kfs meta analysis by ebel 2019 some published post fire infiltration studies have had n for only burned measurements as small as 1 wildfire or 2 prescribed fire fig 1b several studies have also examined the temporal trends in post fire infiltration to assess recovery to pre fire conditions cerdà 1998 ebel 2020b ebel et al 2022 larson nash et al 2018 robichaud et al 2016 shakesby et al 1993 these studies individually used a relatively constant n in each temporal sampling typically 20 30 total measurements i e the sum of burned and unburned n was not adjusted for the changing magnitude and variability of infiltration and associated soil hydraulic properties as soil potentially recovers towards an unburned condition there is a long history in the field of soil science of assessing the n needed to achieve a certain statistical confidence prior efforts have however focused largely on unburned conditions i e soils unaffected by fire for long time periods these unburned soil sampling examinations have considered soil physical properties e g jacob and klute 1956 keisling et al 1977 soil organic matter e g schulte et al 1991 soil nutrients e g cameron et al 1971 emerging contaminants e g back 2007 yu and flury 2021 and soil hydraulic properties e g mason et al 1957 salemi et al 2020 by contrast surprisingly little attention in the post fire community has been devoted to assessing n or statistical power in post fire infiltration studies nyman et al 2010 examined decreases in the sample mean kfs with increases in sample size and white et al 2017 investigated post fire water repellency using stabilization of the cv with increasing sample size to show the importance of high post fire variability only one study after fire that examined the statistical power relative to n for post fire infiltration was noted by robichaud et al 2008 who estimated power using parametric methods this work aims at key gaps remaining for post fire infiltration assessment of the number of measurements needed for comparison of different infiltration methods consideration of time since fire comparing parametric and nonparametric statistical methods and including sites in different geographical locations the objectives of this work are to 1 estimate statistical power at the as sampled n for post fire infiltration measurements and associated soil hydraulic properties kfs s θs 2 present evidence to determine if these efforts are statistically sufficient to characterize differences in soil hydraulic properties between burned and unburned soils 3 examine the effects of soil hydraulic property data magnitudes and variabilities on power at a given n and the associated implications and 4 determine the adequacy of selected studies in terms of power of current approaches using constant n over time to assess post fire infiltration recovery of soil hydraulic properties parametric and nonparametric statistical analysis of previously collected post fire infiltration datasets provides the underpinning for assessing power and n in this work 2 methods the primary considerations estimating statistical power for a given n for environmental science measurements are outlined clearly in helsel et al 2020 and are briefly restated here in the case of post wildfire infiltration and associated soil hydraulic properties we are most often interested in determining if there is a difference between burned and unburned conditions but other group differences of interest can include burn severity geology vegetation post fire management activities and temporal trends e g a difference between infiltration in separate years after a fire the assessment of statistical adequacy of n relates to a decision to reject or accept a null hypothesis h 0 based upon the results of a statistical test relative to a chosen acceptable error rate defined by power and significance level α table 1 summarizes the essential information needed to estimate the n needed to achieve a desired power using parametric e g student s t test and nonparametric e g wilcoxon rank sum statistical approaches based upon hypothesis tests using methods outlined in helsel et al 2020 there are commonalities between the information needed for the parametric and nonparametric methods table 1 more measurements are needed i e increased n for 1 a smaller significance level α for the hypothesis test 2 a greater power for the hypothesis test or 3 a smaller minimum signal to detect between the sample groups i e the effect size table 1 the following sections of the methods present two approaches outlined in helsel et al 2020 to choose or calculate the α power minimum signal for detection and n using one parametric and one nonparametric statistical approach the selection of α is a decision by the researcher of an acceptable type i error rate a typical α value is 0 05 or 0 01 e g helsel et al 2020 which is the probability of rejecting h 0 when h 0 is actually true the statistical power is 1 β where β is the probability of a type ii error amounting to not rejecting h 0 when h 0 is actually false the β is typically selected by the researcher depending on the acceptability of a type ii error rate a representative value for β is 0 1 resulting in a power of 0 9 helsel et al 2020 the statistical confidence 1 α and the power represent the probability of the researcher making the correct decision with regards to rejecting or not rejecting h 0 2 1 parametric method parametric statistical methods have the drawback of assuming an underlying statistical distribution to the data however a lower n is typically needed to achieve a selected power compared to the nonparametric test the soil hydraulic property kfs is typically assumed to be log normally distributed e g freeze and cherry 1979 talsma and hallam 1980 an assumption which can be tested post fire and for other soil hydraulic properties using for example the shapiro wilk test shapiro and wilk 1965 the parametric two sample t test which assumes normality is used here to investigate the power at a given n for post fire soil hydraulic properties for this test the minimum signal to be detected δ σ which is a measure of the effect size requires an estimate of the variability in the data σ which can be calculated using the pooled standard deviation σp helsel et al 2020 1 σ p n 1 s x 2 m 1 s y 2 n m 2 where n and m are the number of samples in each dataset and s x 2 and s y 2 are the sample variances in the two datasets the δ quantifies difference between the two groups the log transformed data are used in equation 1 if the data are assumed log normally distributed or the researcher determines that the log transform brings the data closer to a normal distribution than the original data the formula for approximating n for the two sample t test for a given power is helsel et al 2020 noether 1987 2 n z 1 α z 1 β δ σ 2 where z is a quantile of the standard normal distribution corresponding to the significance points for 1 α and power note that n in equation 2 is for each group individually when n is reported here for the parametric analysis the n represents the burned and unburned measurements together i e 2x the n in equation 2 equation 2 can also be used to calculate the power at a given n δ σ and α the function pwr t2n test from the pwr package champely 2020 in the programming language r r core team 2021 was used to estimate the power of a two sample t test or alternatively determine the n needed to obtain a selected power the cohen s d i e δ σp cohen 1988 of the log transformed data was used as a measure of the effect size where δ is the difference in the sample means of the two groups in the case of log normally distributed data when the logs of the data are taken the two sample t test compares the difference in the mean log transformed data which is the same as testing whether the ratio of the geometric means of the two populations of non transformed data equals 1 the application of the procedure is outlined in helsel et al 2020 section 13 1 the two sample t test was selected for consistency with prior work in unburned areas examining statistical power e g jacob and klute 1956 mason et al 1957 and because the method is widely used readily available and easy to understand 2 2 nonparametric method nonparametric tests do not assume that the data follow a specific distribution these methods do however require an estimate of the minimum detectable signal p that the researcher needs to distinguish analogous to the δ σ for the parametric tests in the nonparametric tests p is the probability that a random sample from one group is greater than a random sample in the other group the procedure to estimate power or n is described by noether 1987 and the equation to approximate n is based on the two group wilcoxon rank sum test helsel et al 2020 3 n z 1 α z 1 β p 0 5 2 12 c 1 c where c is the proportion of data in the first group equal to m 1 n the m 1 denotes the number of measurements in the first group of data and m 2 denotes the number of measurements in the second group of data the value of n is the total number of measurements i e the sum of m 1 and m 2 here that is the burned and unburned measurements helsel et al 2020 in the two group wilcoxon rank sum test h 0 is that the probability of a random sample from one group is greater than a random sample of the other group one half of the time i e that p equals 0 5 thinking of p as analogous to δ σ the h 0 can also be viewed as the ratio of the geometric means of the two groups being equal to 1 as noted by helsel et al 2020 if the ratio of the geometric means is 1 5 then it can be interpreted as the data in the first group typically being 50 percent greater than the data in the second group the wilcoxon rank sum test is done here on the log transformed soil hydraulic property data if an alternate monotonic transformation of the data was used the wilcoxon rank sum test would be a test for a difference in the ratio of medians between the two groups using the method outlined by helsel et al 2020 p can be estimated using the probability function for a normal distribution using the pnorm function in r r core team 2021 using a difference in the means of the two log transformed data groups and the standard deviation of the difference in the log transforms of the two groups see section 13 3 1 in helsel et al 2020 alternatively the procedure in this work uses the script power wmw included in the supplementary material of helsel et al 2020 to estimate n for a selected α β and ratio of geometric means it is worth noting that the log transformation of the data occurs as the default within the script power wmw from helsel et al 2020 and using an alternate data transformation would require a user to edit the source code depending on what data are available i e all data or summary statistics

groups would be used as rg the wilcoxon rank sum test was selected for nonparametric analysis because it is commonly used and available in many open source statistical packages e g r core team 2021 2 3 datasets used for calculations post fire infiltration and calculated soil hydraulic property data are typically reported as summary statistics the full datasets needed to evaluate power or n for transformed data in parametric analyses or nonparametric analyses are often unavailable although there are some exceptions and recent studies have published full datasets furthermore many studies only evaluate infiltration at burned sites which excludes necessary unburned data or a similar comparison to estimate either power or the n required to distinguish a difference to a desired confidence level selected datasets where the needed information for soil hydraulic properties to evaluate n or power for use in this work are briefly described below and summarized in tables 2 and 3 2 3 1 benavides solorio and macdonald 2001 dataset the work by benavides solorio and macdonald 2001 used steady state simulated rainfall on small plots see table 2 in colorado usa that could be used to approximate kfs the pre fire vegetation was primarily conifer forest benavides solorio and macdonald 2001 infiltration measurements were based upon the difference between applied simulated rainfall and measured runoff and were conducted at two locations the bobcat fire site wildfire in 2000 and the lower flowers site prescribed fire in 1999 for the bobcat and lower flowers sites the high and moderate burn severity data were aggregated to represent the burned condition and the low severity and unburned data were aggregated to represent the unburned condition table 2 the data are available in table 2 of benavides solorio and macdonald 2001 2 3 2 cerdà 1998 dataset the infiltration measurements from cerdà 1998 were conducted for four temporal snapshots for 5 3 years after a wildfire in spain see table 2 the vegetation was a mosaic of shrubs termed matorral vegetation cerdà 1998 steady state simulated rainfall on small plots was used to approximate kfs the final set of infiltration measurements at 5 3 years post fire was used as the control to represent long unburned conditions table 2 consistent with the conclusion from cerdà 1998 that infiltration had recovered to long unburned conditions by that time the data are available in table 5 of cerdà 1998 2 3 3 chief et al 2008 dataset in the study by chief et al 2008 constant and falling head permeameters were used for intact soil samples collected from burned and unburned areas that were analyzed in the laboratory to measure infiltration and kfs see table 2 the soil samples were collected from broadleaf woodland chaparral and conifer forest sites in the area of the 2003 aspen fire wildfire chief et al 2008 the summary statistics of the log transformed kfs data are available in table 2 of chief et al 2008 because the full dataset was not available only the parametric power analysis was used for this dataset 2 3 4 ebel 2020b dataset the infiltration measurements from ebel 2020b were collected in situ from burned and unburned soils by using a tension infiltrometer for four temporal snapshots within 7 years after the wildfire table 2 the pre fire vegetation was coniferous forest and the sites were in the area of the 2010 fourmile canyon fire wildfire in colorado usa ebel 2020b the infiltration measurements were used to estimate kfs and s ebel 2020b the unburned kfs and s was aggregated across all years because of a lack of statistical differences between years ebel 2020b and then compared to the burned measurements from each year table 2 the kfs and s data are available from ebel 2020a at https doi org 10 5066 p9rcnfd9 2 3 5 ebel and moody 2020 dataset the infiltration data from ebel and moody 2020 were measured by using a tension infiltrometer in the laboratory on intact burned and unburned soil cores moody et al 2019 the pre fire vegetation was mixed chaparral and the sites were within the area of the 2017 thomas fire wildfire in california usa moody et al 2019 the infiltration measurements table 2 were used to estimate kfs and s ebel and moody 2020 the saturated volumetric soil water content θs was measured at the same sites using immersion saturation followed by oven drying as part of the procedure to measure drying soil water retention curves ebel and moody 2020 the kfs s and θs data are available from ebel and moody 2019 at https doi org 10 5066 p9dy6xjs 3 results 3 1 comparisons of selected post fire infiltration datasets differences in variability between kfs estimates from the three infiltration measurement methods showed by σp represented the greatest contrast between the selected datasets fig 2 table 3 the median σp for tension infiltrometer measurements is about twice the median σp for constant and falling head permeameter measurements and about 4 times the median σp for steady state rainfall simulation measurements for kfs fig 2 table 3 the rg for tension infiltrometer measurements tends to be greater and more variable than constant and falling head permeameter measurements and steady state rainfall simulation measurements for kfs fig 2 table 3 effect size as measured in the parametric analysis by using cohen s d tends to be greatest for steady state rainfall simulation methods fig 2 table 3 the p as a function of rg for kfs is more steeply sloped meaning that the p approaches 1 more rapidly with increasing rg for the steady state rainfall simulations relative to the tension infiltrometer measurements fig 3 cohen s d rg and p for kfs tended to decline with time since fire for all infiltration methods although the decreases were more pronounced for the tension infiltrometer measurements than for the steady state rainfall simulation measurements fig 3 table 3 because cohen s d and p are both effect size measures they are correlated when the absolute values of cohen s d of the log transformed data are compared to p recalling that p cannot exceed unity fig 4 the cubic fit functional relation is not intended for use beyond the data presented in this work and clearly the cubic fit is not appropriate as p approaches unity but the fit shows the strong nonlinear correlation fig 4 r2 0 98 between the two effect size metrics of the parametric and nonparametric approaches used in this work there are also differences in measurement scale between the infiltration measurement methods with the steady state rainfall simulations conducted at larger scales 82 2500 cm2 whereas the constant falling head permeameter and tension infiltrometer measurements were at a smaller scale 16 22 cm2 table 2 the n was also smaller for the steady state rainfall simulations relative to the constant falling head permeameter and tension infiltrometer measurements table 2 3 2 parametric results the statistical power at the as sampled n showed substantial variability across measurement method location and time since fire for the parametric statistical analysis about half of the studies in the first year after fire had a power 0 9 for kfs 57 and s 50 at the as sampled n for α of 0 05 table 3 the constant and falling head permeameter measurements of kfs required n 100 to have power 0 9 for α of 0 05 although the chief et al 2008 study did collect sufficient measurements to achieve this fig 5 tension infiltrometer measurements in the first year after fire had a power of approximately 1 for kfs and s for ebel 2020b but powers of 0 56 for kfs and 0 38 for s for ebel and moody 2020 at the as sampled n fig 5 table 3 steady state rainfall simulation estimates of kfs in the first year after fire were similarly variable with power of 0 99 for cerdà 1998 but smaller power of 0 22 and 0 1 from benavides solorio and macdonald 2001 at the as sampled n fig 5 table 3 for α of 0 05 the θs in the first year after fire ahad a power of 0 99 at the as sampled n from ebel and moody 2020 for α of 0 05 as expected when the α was decreased from 0 05 to 0 01 the power declined at the as sampled n and the n needed to achieve power 0 9 increased table 3 the power declined with time since fire for all measurement methods for kfs and s when the as sampled n stayed constant across sampling years steady state rainfall simulation measurements of kfs tended to maintain greater power over time than tension infiltrometer measurements table 3 fig 5 for a given relatively constant n over time comparing the cerdà 1998 and ebel and moody 2020 measurements for α of 0 05 the power for a chosen α is clearly greater when the difference between the groups is larger as indicated by rg or when the variability is smaller as indicated by σp both of which are captured in the effect size through cohen s d when fewer measurements are taken a greater cohen s d is required to achieve the same target power fig 6 for example to achieve power equal to 0 9 for an n of 10 d must be 2 35 for an n of 20 d must be 1 55 for an n of 40 d must be 1 05 and for an n of 80 d must be 0 75 fig 6 as a reminder n is the sum of the number of burned and unburned measurements assumed to be equal between the two groups in fig 6 3 3 nonparametric results the nonparametric results also showed substantial variability in power at the as sampled n across measurement method location and time since fire similar to the parametric statistical analysis only 40 of the kfs studies and 50 of the s studies in the first year after fire had a power 0 9 at the as sampled n for α of 0 05 table 3 fig 7 trends in power for kfs and s across measurement methods and time since fire were essentially the same as for the parametric measurements with large variations in power consistent with major differences between the different studies and across years for n σp and r including the trend in declining power with time since fire table 3 fig 7 the n needed to reach a power of 0 9 tends to increase with elapsed time since fire however in the study by ebel 2020b the temporal trends reverse for kfs and s in terms of power and n by the 7th year after fire with increases in effect size i e p relative to the previous measurements 5 years after fire table 3 figs 3 7 this is because the burned kfs and s are becoming increasingly greater than the unburned kfs and s remembering that when rg is 1 the inverse reflects the magnitude of the differences in geometric means table 3 an alternate way of examining the question of whether sufficient measurements were taken to achieve a power of 0 9 is to take the ratio of the as sampled n of a study over the n at power equal to 0 9 see table 3 fig 8 the nonparametric analysis indicates that only about 50 of the studies collected enough post fire infiltration measurements to achieve a statistical power of 0 9 for α of 0 05 i e the ratio is 1 in fig 8 delving further into underlying differences in effect size as quantified by p facilitates understanding differences in as sampled power and provides insight into the factors influencing power maintaining a constant rg 2 7 taken from the kfs in ebel and moody 2020 shows the effect of measurement variability in kfs i e σp between tension infiltrometer measurements and steady state rainfall simulations fig 9 in the first year after fire the greater measurement variability in kfs for tension infiltrometers decreases the effect size p see fig 3 and thus reduces the power relative to steady state infiltrometer measurements in the first year after fire fig 9 decreasing α from 0 05 to 0 01 further increases the n needed to achieve a given power and exacerbates the differences in power between measurement methods at a given n fig 9 comparing two studies in the first year after fire cerdà 1998 ebel and moody 2020 as rg changes further highlights differences in power between steady state rainfall simulation and tension infiltrometer measurements of infiltration and associated kfs fig 10 the increased variability in kfs from the tension infiltrometer measurements relative to the steady state infiltration measurements causes a nearly factor of 10 increase in n needed to reach a power of 0 9 for a given rg especially when rg is in typical ranges of rg 1 5 to 2 5 see table 3 fig 10 for tension infiltrometer kfs measurements with σp similar to ebel and moody 2020 only when rg is 5 would n fall into a typical range of post fire sampling of 20 samples or less to have a power of 0 9 fig 10 in contrast the kfs measurements from steady state rainfall simulation experiments could achieve a power of 0 9 with rg of 2 5 with an n of approximately 14 4 discussion 4 1 are we collecting enough post fire infiltration measurements half of the studies examined did not collect sufficient infiltration measurements to statistically discriminate group differences in burned and unburned soil hydraulic properties of kfs and s at a power of 0 9 or greater with α of 0 05 the assessment of as sampled n sufficiency is the same for both parametric and nonparametric analysis table 3 figs 5 7 9 this suggests that post fire infiltration studies need to collect more measurements to distinguish differences between burned and unburned soils to achieve typical thresholds for statistical power fig 1b a notable exception to this is θs which had a relatively high power despite a small n of 41 this is likely because of the small variability i e σp see table 3 although it is based on only one study examination of the parametric and nonparametric analysis suggests approximate thresholds for an absolute value of cohen s d of 1 25 to 1 5 or p 0 8 to 0 85 for log transformed data of soil hydraulic properties to achieve a power of 0 9 for an n of 20 30 total measurements sum of burned and unburned table 3 figs 5 6 7 when the absolute value of cohen s d or p are approximately 0 7 for log transformed data of soil hydraulic properties the n needed to achieve a power of 0 9 becomes more challenging and can even exceed 100 total measurements table 3 figs 5 6 7 ultimately it is up to the scientist or engineer to decide an appropriate level of type one i e α or two i e power error that is tolerable for the selected application prior to conducting a new field study a review of the literature for typical cohen s d values for log transformed soil hydraulic properties for a given vegetation type climate soil type burn severity or other important factors could be used to provide preliminary guidance on n which could be confirmed with parametric or nonparametric analysis of the type conducted here to assess power at the as sampled n 4 2 the number of infiltration measurements generally needs to increase with time since fire the number of infiltration measurements i e n needed to increase with time since fire to maintain a constant power in all of the post fire studies examined here because the n is often kept constant over time with elapsed time since fire a constant n typically drops below the threshold n to achieve a power of 0 9 fig 10 this is because the effect size i e cohen s d and p typically decrease with time since fire table 3 the rg especially tends to decrease with time since fire and while σp also tends to decrease with time since fire it does not offset the more substantial decrease in rg as the soil hydraulic properties recover nearer to unburned values table 3 one particular anomaly in this trend is that in the ebel 2020b soil hydraulic property data the rg overshoots and the burned kfs exceeds the unburned kfs geometric mean between years 5 and 7 after fire the same phenomenon was present for the unburned s geometric mean from ebel 2020b between years 3 5 after fire in that specific case from ebel 2020b the n to achieve a power of 0 9 decreases with time after fire following the overshoot time as the rg drops further below unity these results indicate that the n for post fire infiltration measurements should likely increase with time since fire in proportion to any decrease in effect size if the goal is to maintain the same power at least until the rg reaches 1 4 3 differences between post fire infiltration measurement methods the differences in measurement variability between infiltration methods lead to critical disparities in the n needed to achieve a power of 0 9 the steady state rainfall simulation method has a clear advantage over both constant or falling head permeameter measurements and tension infiltrometer measurements in terms of achieving a greater power with a smaller n for a given rg figs 9 10 these methodological differences are primarily the result of the substantially smaller variability i e σp in the steady state rainfall simulation method relative to the tension infiltrometer and constant or falling head permeameter measurements table 3 fig 1a 2 9 10 it is not clear if these differences in measurement variability are the result of the generally larger surface area of the steady state simulated rainfall measurements relative to the constant or falling head permeameter measurements and tension infiltrometer measurements table 2 prior work on post fire soil hydraulic properties has shown moderate langhans et al 2016 to weak ebel 2019 effects of the scale of measurement in terms of magnitude and variability measurement method had a greater influence than scale ebel 2019 alternatively the differences between the infiltration measurements methods may be an artifact of the relatively small number of studies examined in this work in that case the inferences drawn regarding methodological differences in power may not be reliably extrapolated beyond this work until further comparisons are done with other data increasing the temporal resolution of tension infiltrometer measurements has been shown to reduce kfs and s variability moody et al 2019 showed that automated high temporal resolution 1 hz tension infiltrometer measurements after wildfire significantly decreased the variability of estimated soil hydraulic properties compared to the usual visual manually recorded measurements this suggests that increasing the accuracy and temporal resolution of tension infiltrometer measurements could also reduce the variability and therefore the n needed to achieve a selected power comparisons of infiltration methods in unburned environments support the findings here of greater variability in tension infiltrometer measurements compared to steady state rainfall simulation morbidelli et al 2017 infiltration analysis in unburned environments has also shown differences between steady state and transient estimates of kfs suggesting that the transient nature of the tension infiltrometer measurements could result in more variable soil hydraulic property estimates di prima et al 2018 overall tension infiltrometer measurements after wildfire tend to be highly variable ebel and moody 2020 kean et al 2019 mcguire et al 2018 moody et al 2019 tang et al 2019 and the implications of this variability for increasing the n needed to achieve a given power are important to consider when selecting a post fire infiltration method the greater variability of post fire tension infiltrometer measurements compared to steady state rainfall simulation may complicate using soil hydraulic properties from tension infiltrometer data in meta analysis and synthesis studies 4 4 implications for syntheses meta analyses and future data collection the results presented have important implications for studies seeking to refine our knowledge through synthesis and meta analysis of existing work and also for future data collection infiltration data after fires and associated estimates of soil hydraulic properties are increasingly used in studies that examine broad trends or gaps e g cerdà and robichaud 2009 ebel and moody 2017 neary 2011 termed synthesis efforts here or meta analyses e g ebel 2019 ebel and martin 2017 that utilize statistical models to draw inferences regarding regional and local factors affecting post fire infiltration or temporal recovery these efforts seldom incorporate the statistical power of the individual studies as a weighting factor in the synthesis or meta analysis yet omitting weighting by statistical power gives equal weight to studies with potentially vast disparities in statistical confidence for distinguishing differences between burned and unburned data perhaps studies with low power should even be excluded entirely from such meta analysis especially when those studies have very small n see fig 1b the statistical analysis in this work is for a relatively limited number of studies that certainly would benefit from further inclusion of datasets however many post fire infiltration studies 1 do not collect unburned samples to compare to preventing accurately assessing the statistical power of the characterization or 2 do not publish the full data only summary statistics in a review of post fire kfs measurement studies from ebel 2019 only 17 sites in 8 separate studies out of 73 sites 23 measured an unburned site for comparison and of these only two benavides solorio and macdonald 2001 ebel et al 2012 had all the data publicly available for analysis further burned unburned comparisons and open publication of post fire infiltration datasets could greatly facilitate more rigorous synthesis and meta analysis studies a final implication of this work was the general agreement between the parametric and nonparametric statistical analysis suggesting that either method provides a reasonable estimate of the n or power for post fire infiltration measurements if a monotonic transformation of the data such as the log transformation used here cannot approximate a normal distribution including the presence of data asymmetry or outliers then the nonparametric test would provide a more accurate characterization of n and power than the parametric approach helsel et al 2020 5 conclusions this work examined the statistical power of soil hydraulic properties estimated following wildland fire for different n of infiltration measurements using previously published data from the literature both parametric two sample t test and nonparametric two group wilcoxon rank sum test statistical techniques were used to assess power and n results showed minimal differences between the power estimates provided by the parametric and nonparametric methods on log transformed soil hydraulic property data approximately half of the studies collected an insufficient number of infiltration measurements to statistically discriminate group differences in soil hydraulic properties of kfs and s with a statistical power of 0 9 or greater and with α of 0 05 this suggests that post fire infiltration studies may need to collect more measurements than is typical to enhance statistical confidence the high variability of post fire kfs and s was a critical factor in the large n needed to achieve a power of 0 9 the much smaller variability in θs resulted in a relatively small n for power equal to 0 9 the rg was also a critical control on n confirming that effect size assessment prior to or concurrent with infiltration measurements would promote achieving acceptable power when estimating soil hydraulic properties after wildfire this work suggests that for a typical post fire study which often has n equal 20 to 30 measurements sum of burned and unburned that the absolute value of cohen s d must be 1 25 to 1 5 or p must be 0 8 to 0 85 for log transformed data of soil hydraulic properties to achieve a power of 0 9 the n typically needed to increase with time since fire to maintain a power of 0 9 because of decreases in effect size cohen s d or p with time since fire this analysis also suggested methodological differences in statistical power with steady state rainfall simulations having greater power than both tension infiltrometers and constant or falling head permeameters for a given n the methodological differences in power were primarily the result of differences in variability for example tension infiltrometer kfs was approximately 4 times more variable than steady state infiltrometer kfs based on median σp the results also suggest that for synthesis and meta analysis efforts that weighting by statistical power could enhance the accuracy and robustness of such analyses for post fire soil hydraulic properties furthermore the large variability in post fire tension infiltrometer measurements and associated soil hydraulic properties of kfs and s may complicate using these data in meta analysis credit authorship contribution

3208,infiltration and associated soil hydraulic properties such as field saturated hydraulic conductivity kfs sorptivity s or saturated soil water content θs are measured after wildland fires to assess risks of water related hazards and water supply impairment yet the statistical power of these data to distinguish between burned and unburned infiltration is seldom assessed despite the typically small number of total measurements n here parametric and nonparametric statistical approaches are used to assess the primary influences on the statistical power and whether the n is sufficient to achieve a representative power of 0 9 about half of the studies examined did not achieve a power 0 9 at the as sampled n suggesting the need for post fire infiltration studies to collect more measurements effect size was the primary control on power and therefore the n needed to achieve a given power because effect size tends to decrease with time since fire n generally needs to increase with time since fire in infiltration studies power estimates were similar for parametric and nonparametric analyses comparisons between infiltration methods suggested that steady state rainfall simulation produced a greater power for a given n relative to both tension infiltrometers and constant or falling head permeameters the greater power of the steady state rainfall simulation method was the result of smaller variability compared to the tension infiltrometers and constant or falling head permeameters the substantial variability of post fire tension infiltrometer measurements may complicate using these data in meta analyses this work further suggests that synthesis or meta analysis studies of post fire soil hydraulic properties may be more robust if data are weighted by statistical power the differences in statistical power between infiltration measurement methods require further demonstration for a broader range of datasets before extrapolation beyond the datasets considered here keywords number of samples wildfire hydraulic properties statistical power hydraulic conductivity sorptivity 1 introduction infiltration is one of the most common

ebel et al 2012 nyman et al 2010 further examination of the review of infiltration studies and associated kfs estimates from ebel 2019 shows that different measurement methods also exhibit kfs differences in measurement variability as quantified by the coefficient of variation cv defined as the standard deviation normalized by the mean fig 1 a for example tension infiltrometer kfs had a median cv of 1 32 and constant or falling head permeameter kfs had a median cv of 0 19 whereas steady state rainfall simulation kfs had a median of cv of 0 32 fig 1a the fire science community is still investigating the significance of these potential differences in variability between infiltration measurement methods however we know from prior work in unburned conditions that increased soil variability can complicate measurement efforts e g mader 1963 because of disparities between methods in the time needed to prepare and complete infiltration measurements these different methods typically do not conduct the same number of measurements n with the more time consuming simulated rainfall measurements often having a smaller n fig 1b the number of measurements of infiltration needed to discern differences between burned and unburned soil conditions is crucial information regardless of the measurement method used or the scale of characterization confidence in assessing infiltration differences resulting from wildland fire can be quantified by knowing the statistical power associated with a given n or by selecting n to achieve a desired power post fire infiltration measurement studies typically collect a small n because of limited site access the potentially long duration of individual infiltration measurements and financial constraints fig 1b in the post fire kfs meta analysis by ebel 2019 some published post fire infiltration studies have had n for only burned measurements as small as 1 wildfire or 2 prescribed fire fig 1b several studies have also examined the temporal trends in post fire infiltration to assess recovery to pre fire conditions cerdà 1998 ebel 2020b ebel et al 2022 larson nash et al 2018 robichaud et al 2016 shakesby et al 1993 these studies individually used a relatively constant n in each temporal sampling typically 20 30 total measurements i e the sum of burned and unburned n was not adjusted for the changing magnitude and variability of infiltration and associated soil hydraulic properties as soil potentially recovers towards an unburned condition there is a long history in the field of soil science of assessing the n needed to achieve a certain statistical confidence prior efforts have however focused largely on unburned conditions i e soils unaffected by fire for long time periods these unburned soil

to assessing n or statistical power in post fire infiltration studies nyman et al 2010 examined decreases in the sample mean kfs with increases in sample size and white et al 2017 investigated post fire water repellency using stabilization of the cv with increasing sample size to show the importance of high post fire variability only one study after fire that examined the statistical power relative to n for post fire infiltration was noted by robichaud et al 2008 who estimated power using parametric methods this work aims at key gaps remaining for post fire infiltration assessment of the number of measurements needed for comparison of different infiltration methods consideration of time since fire comparing parametric and nonparametric statistical methods and including sites in different geographical locations the objectives of this work are to 1 estimate statistical power at the as sampled n for post fire infiltration measurements and associated soil hydraulic properties

of soil hydraulic property data magnitudes and variabilities on power at a given n and the associated implications and 4 determine the adequacy of selected studies in terms of power of current approaches using constant n over time to assess post fire infiltration recovery of soil hydraulic properties parametric and nonparametric statistical analysis of previously collected post fire infiltration datasets provides the underpinning for assessing power and n in this work 2 methods the primary considerations estimating statistical power for a given n for environmental science measurements are outlined clearly in helsel et al 2020 and are briefly restated here in the case of post wildfire infiltration and associated soil hydraulic properties we are most often interested in determining if there is a difference between burned and unburned conditions but other group differences of interest can include burn severity geology vegetation post fire management activities and temporal trends e g a difference between infiltration in separate years after a fire the assessment of statistical adequacy of n relates to a decision to reject or accept a null hypothesis h 0 based upon the results of a statistical test relative to a chosen acceptable error rate defined by power and significance level α table 1 summarizes the essential information needed to estimate the n needed to achieve a desired power using parametric e g student s t test and nonparametric e g wilcoxon rank sum statistical approaches based upon hypothesis tests using methods outlined in helsel et al 2020 there are commonalities between the information needed for the parametric and nonparametric methods table 1 more measurements are needed i e increased n for 1 a smaller significance level α for the hypothesis test 2 a greater power for the hypothesis test or 3 a smaller minimum signal to detect between the sample groups i e the effect size table 1 the following sections of the methods present two approaches outlined in helsel et al 2020 to choose or calculate the α power minimum signal for detection and n using one parametric and one nonparametric statistical approach the selection of α is a decision by the researcher of an acceptable type i error rate a typical α value is 0 05 or 0 01 e g helsel et al 2020 which is the probability of rejecting h 0 when h 0 is actually true the statistical power is 1 β where β is the probability of a type ii error amounting to not rejecting h 0 when h 0 is actually false the β is typically selected by the researcher depending on the acceptability of a type ii error rate a representative value for β is 0 1 resulting in a power of 0 9 helsel et al 2020 the statistical confidence 1 α and the power represent the probability of the researcher making the correct decision with regards to rejecting or not rejecting h 0 2 1 parametric method parametric statistical methods have the drawback of assuming an underlying statistical distribution to the data however a lower n is typically needed to achieve a selected power compared to the nonparametric test the soil hydraulic property kfs is typically assumed to be log normally distributed e g freeze and cherry 1979 talsma and hallam 1980 an assumption which can be tested post fire and for other soil hydraulic properties using for example the shapiro wilk test shapiro and wilk 1965 the parametric two sample t test which assumes normality is used here to investigate the power at a given n for post fire soil hydraulic properties for this test the minimum signal to be detected δ σ which is a measure of the effect size requires an estimate of the variability in the data σ which can be calculated using the pooled standard deviation σp helsel et al 2020 1 σ p n 1 s x 2 m 1 s y 2 n m 2 where n and m are the number of samples in each dataset and s x 2 and s y 2 are the sample variances in the two datasets the δ quantifies difference between the two groups the log transformed data are used in equation 1 if the data are assumed log normally distributed or the researcher determines that the log transform brings the data closer to a normal distribution than the original data the formula for approximating n for the two sample t test for a given power is helsel et al 2020 noether 1987 2 n z 1 α z 1 β δ σ 2 where z is a quantile of the standard normal distribution corresponding to the significance points for 1 α and power note that n in equation 2 is for each group individually when n is reported here for the parametric analysis the n represents the burned and unburned measurements together i e 2x the n in equation 2 equation 2 can also be used to calculate the power at a given n δ σ and α the function pwr t2n test from the pwr package champely 2020 in the programming language r r core team 2021 was used to estimate the power of a two sample t test or alternatively determine the n needed to obtain a selected power the cohen s d i e δ σp cohen 1988 of the log transformed data was used as a measure of the effect size where δ is the difference in the sample means of the two groups in the case of log normally distributed data when the logs of the data are taken the two sample t test compares the difference in the mean log transformed data which is the same as testing whether the ratio of the geometric means of the two populations of non transformed data equals 1 the application of the procedure is outlined in helsel et al 2020 section 13 1 the two sample t test was selected for consistency with prior work in unburned areas examining statistical power e g jacob and klute 1956 mason et al 1957 and because the method is widely used readily available and easy to understand 2 2 nonparametric method nonparametric tests do not assume that the data follow a specific distribution these methods do however require an estimate of the minimum detectable signal p that the researcher needs to distinguish analogous to the δ σ for the parametric tests in the nonparametric tests p is the probability that a random sample from one group is greater than a random sample in the other group the procedure to estimate power or n is described by noether 1987 and the equation to approximate n is based on the two group wilcoxon rank sum test helsel et al 2020 3 n z 1 α z 1 β p 0 5 2 12 c 1 c where c is the proportion of data in the first group equal to m 1 n the m 1 denotes the number of measurements in the first group of data and m 2 denotes the number of measurements in the second group of data the value of n is the total number of measurements i e the sum of m 1 and m 2 here that is the burned and unburned measurements helsel et al 2020 in the two group wilcoxon rank sum test h 0 is that the probability of a random sample from one group is greater than a random sample of the other group one half of the time i e that p equals 0 5 thinking of p as analogous to δ σ the h 0 can also be viewed as the ratio of the geometric means of the two groups being equal to 1 as noted by helsel et al 2020 if the ratio of the geometric means is 1 5 then it can be interpreted as the data in the first group typically being 50 percent greater than the data in the second group the wilcoxon rank sum test is done here on the log transformed soil hydraulic property data if an alternate monotonic transformation of the data was used the wilcoxon rank sum test would be a test for a difference in the ratio of medians between the two groups using the method outlined by helsel et al 2020 p can be estimated using the probability function for a normal distribution using the pnorm function in r r core team 2021 using a difference in the means of the two log transformed data groups and the standard deviation of the difference in the log transforms of the two groups see section 13 3 1 in helsel et al 2020 alternatively the procedure in this work uses the script power wmw included in the supplementary material of helsel et al 2020 to estimate n for a selected α β and ratio of geometric means it is worth noting that the log transformation of the data occurs as the default within the script power wmw from helsel et al 2020 and using an alternate data transformation would require a user to edit the source code depending on what data are available i e all data or summary statistics from published data one could capitalize on the relation for the geometric mean ratio r g r g gmean g r o u p 1 gmean g r o u p 2 e x p mean ln g r o u p 1 mean l n g r o u p 1 where gmean is the geometric mean of group 1 or 2 exp is the exponential ln is the natural log of group 1 or 2 if a different monotonic data transformation than the log transform was used the ratio of medians of the two groups would be used as rg the wilcoxon rank sum test was selected for nonparametric analysis because it is commonly used and available in many open source statistical packages e g r core team 2021 2 3 datasets used for calculations post fire infiltration and calculated soil hydraulic property data are typically reported as summary statistics the full datasets needed to evaluate power or n for transformed data in parametric analyses or nonparametric analyses are often unavailable although there are some exceptions and recent studies have published full datasets furthermore many studies only evaluate infiltration at burned sites which excludes necessary unburned data or a similar comparison to estimate either power or the n required to distinguish a difference to a desired confidence level selected datasets where the needed information for soil hydraulic properties to evaluate n or power for use in this work are briefly described below and summarized in tables 2 and 3 2 3 1 benavides solorio and macdonald 2001 dataset the work by benavides solorio and macdonald 2001 used steady state simulated rainfall on small plots see table 2 in colorado usa that could be used to approximate kfs the pre fire vegetation was primarily conifer forest benavides solorio and macdonald 2001 infiltration measurements were based upon the difference between applied simulated rainfall and measured runoff and were conducted at two locations the bobcat fire site wildfire in 2000 and the lower flowers site prescribed fire in 1999 for the bobcat and lower flowers sites the high and moderate burn severity data were aggregated to represent the burned condition and the low severity and unburned data were aggregated to represent the unburned condition table 2 the data are available in table 2 of benavides solorio and macdonald 2001 2 3 2 cerdà 1998 dataset the infiltration measurements from cerdà 1998 were conducted for four temporal snapshots for 5 3 years after a wildfire in spain see table 2 the vegetation was a mosaic of shrubs termed matorral vegetation cerdà 1998 steady state simulated rainfall on small plots was used to approximate kfs the final set of infiltration measurements at 5 3 years post fire was used as the control to represent long unburned conditions table 2 consistent with the conclusion from cerdà 1998 that infiltration had recovered to long unburned conditions by that time the data are available in table 5 of cerdà 1998 2 3 3 chief et al 2008 dataset in the study by chief et al 2008 constant and falling head permeameters were used for intact soil samples collected from burned and unburned areas that were analyzed in the laboratory to measure infiltration and kfs see table 2 the soil samples were collected from broadleaf woodland chaparral and conifer forest sites in the area of the 2003 aspen fire wildfire chief et al 2008 the summary statistics of the log transformed kfs data are available in table 2 of chief et al 2008 because the full dataset was not available only the parametric power analysis was used for this dataset 2 3 4 ebel 2020b dataset the infiltration measurements from ebel 2020b were collected in situ from burned and unburned soils by using a tension infiltrometer for four temporal snapshots within 7 years after the wildfire table 2 the pre fire vegetation was coniferous forest and the sites were in the area of the 2010 fourmile canyon fire wildfire in colorado usa ebel 2020b the infiltration measurements were used to estimate kfs and s ebel 2020b the unburned kfs and s was aggregated across all years because of a lack of statistical differences between years ebel 2020b and then compared to the burned measurements from each year table 2 the kfs and s data are available from ebel 2020a at https doi org 10 5066 p9rcnfd9 2 3 5 ebel and moody 2020 dataset the infiltration data from ebel and moody 2020 were measured by using a tension infiltrometer in the laboratory on intact burned and unburned soil cores moody et al 2019 the pre fire vegetation was mixed chaparral and the sites were within the area of the 2017 thomas fire wildfire in california usa moody et al 2019 the infiltration measurements table 2 were used to estimate kfs and s ebel and moody 2020 the saturated volumetric soil water content θs was measured at the same sites using immersion saturation followed by oven drying as part of the procedure to measure drying soil water retention curves ebel and moody 2020 the kfs s and θs data are available from ebel and moody 2019 at https doi org 10 5066 p9dy6xjs 3 results 3 1 comparisons of selected post fire infiltration datasets differences in variability between kfs estimates from the three infiltration measurement methods showed by σp represented the greatest contrast between the selected datasets fig 2 table 3 the median σp for tension infiltrometer measurements is about twice the median σp for constant and falling head permeameter measurements and about 4 times the median σp for steady state rainfall simulation measurements for kfs fig 2 table 3 the rg for tension infiltrometer measurements tends to be greater and more variable than constant and falling head permeameter measurements and steady state rainfall simulation measurements for kfs fig 2 table 3 effect size as measured in the parametric analysis by using cohen s d tends to be greatest for steady state rainfall simulation methods fig 2 table 3 the p as a function of rg for kfs is more steeply sloped meaning that the p approaches 1 more rapidly with increasing rg for the steady state rainfall simulations relative to the tension infiltrometer measurements fig 3 cohen s d rg and p for kfs tended to decline with time since fire for all infiltration methods although the decreases were more pronounced for the tension infiltrometer measurements than for the steady state rainfall simulation measurements fig 3 table 3 because cohen s d and p are both effect size measures they are correlated when the absolute values of cohen s d of the log transformed data are compared to p recalling that p cannot exceed unity fig 4 the cubic fit functional relation is not intended for use beyond the data presented in this work and clearly the cubic fit is not appropriate as p approaches unity but the fit shows the strong nonlinear correlation fig 4 r2 0 98 between the two effect size metrics of the parametric and nonparametric approaches used in this work there are also differences in measurement scale between the infiltration measurement methods with the steady state rainfall simulations conducted at larger scales 82 2500 cm2 whereas the constant falling head permeameter and tension infiltrometer measurements were at a smaller scale 16 22 cm2 table 2 the n was also smaller for the steady state rainfall simulations relative to the constant falling head permeameter and tension infiltrometer measurements table 2 3 2 parametric results the statistical power at the as sampled n showed substantial variability across measurement method location and time since fire for the parametric statistical analysis about half of the studies in the first year after fire had a power 0 9 for kfs 57 and s 50 at the as sampled n for α of 0 05 table 3 the constant and falling head permeameter measurements of kfs required n 100 to have power 0 9 for α of 0 05 although the chief et al 2008 study did collect sufficient measurements to achieve this fig 5 tension infiltrometer measurements in the first year after fire had a power of approximately 1 for kfs and s for ebel 2020b but powers of 0 56 for kfs and 0 38 for s for ebel and moody 2020 at the as sampled n fig 5 table 3 steady state rainfall simulation estimates of kfs in the first year after fire were similarly variable with power of 0 99 for cerdà 1998 but smaller power of 0 22 and 0 1 from benavides solorio and macdonald 2001 at the as sampled n fig 5 table 3 for α of 0 05 the θs in the first year after fire ahad a power of 0 99 at the as sampled n from ebel and moody 2020 for α of 0 05 as expected when the α was decreased from 0 05 to 0 01 the power declined at the as sampled n and the n needed to achieve power 0 9 increased table 3 the power declined with time since fire for all measurement methods for kfs and s when the as sampled n stayed constant across sampling years steady state rainfall simulation measurements of kfs tended to maintain greater power over time than tension infiltrometer measurements table 3 fig 5 for a given relatively constant n over time comparing the cerdà 1998 and ebel and moody 2020 measurements for α of 0 05 the power for a chosen α is clearly greater when the difference between the groups is larger as indicated by rg or when the variability is smaller as indicated by σp both of which are captured in the effect size through cohen s d when fewer measurements are taken a greater cohen s d is required to achieve the same target power fig 6 for example to achieve power equal to 0 9 for an n of 10 d must be 2 35 for an n of 20 d must be 1 55 for an n of 40 d must be 1 05 and for an n of 80 d must be 0 75 fig 6 as a reminder n is the sum of the number of burned and unburned measurements assumed to be equal between the two groups in fig 6 3 3 nonparametric results the nonparametric results also showed substantial variability in power at the as sampled n across measurement method location and time since fire similar to the parametric statistical analysis only 40 of the kfs studies and 50 of the s studies in the first year after fire had a power 0 9 at the as sampled n for α of 0 05 table 3 fig 7 trends in power for kfs and s across measurement methods and time since fire were essentially the same as for the parametric measurements with large variations in power consistent with major differences between the different studies and across years for n σp and r including the trend in declining power with time since fire table 3 fig 7 the n needed to reach a power of 0 9 tends to increase with elapsed time since fire however in the study by ebel 2020b the temporal trends reverse for kfs and s in terms of power and n by the 7th year after fire with increases in effect size i e p relative to the previous measurements 5 years after fire table 3 figs 3 7 this is because the burned kfs and s are becoming increasingly greater than the unburned kfs and s remembering that when rg is 1 the inverse reflects the magnitude of the differences in geometric means table 3 an alternate way of examining the question of whether sufficient measurements were taken to achieve a power of 0 9 is to take the ratio of the as sampled n of a study over the n at power equal to 0 9 see table 3 fig 8 the nonparametric analysis indicates that only about 50 of the studies collected enough post fire infiltration measurements to achieve a statistical power of 0 9 for α of 0 05 i e the ratio is 1 in fig 8 delving further into underlying differences in effect size as quantified by p facilitates understanding differences in as sampled power and provides insight into the factors influencing power maintaining a constant rg 2 7 taken from the kfs in ebel and moody 2020 shows the effect of measurement variability in kfs i e σp between tension infiltrometer measurements and steady state rainfall simulations fig 9 in the first year after fire the greater measurement variability in kfs for tension infiltrometers decreases the effect size p see fig 3 and thus reduces the power relative to steady state infiltrometer measurements in the first year after fire fig 9 decreasing α from 0 05 to 0 01 further increases the n needed to achieve a given power and exacerbates the differences in power between measurement methods at a given n fig 9 comparing two studies in the first year after fire cerdà 1998 ebel and moody 2020 as rg changes further highlights differences in power between steady state rainfall simulation and tension infiltrometer measurements of infiltration and associated kfs fig 10 the increased variability in kfs from the tension infiltrometer measurements relative to the steady state infiltration measurements causes a nearly factor of 10 increase in n needed to reach a power of 0 9 for a given rg especially when rg is in typical ranges of rg 1 5 to 2 5 see table 3 fig 10 for tension infiltrometer kfs measurements with σp similar to ebel and moody 2020 only when rg is 5 would n fall into a typical range of post fire sampling of 20 samples or less to have a power of 0 9 fig 10 in contrast the kfs measurements from steady state rainfall simulation experiments could achieve a power of 0 9 with rg of 2 5 with an n of approximately 14 4 discussion 4 1 are we collecting enough post fire infiltration measurements half of the studies examined did not collect sufficient infiltration measurements to statistically discriminate group differences in burned and unburned soil hydraulic properties of kfs and s at a power of 0 9 or greater with α of 0 05 the assessment of as sampled n sufficiency is the same for both parametric and nonparametric analysis table 3 figs 5 7 9 this suggests that post fire infiltration studies need to collect more measurements to distinguish differences between burned and unburned soils to achieve typical thresholds for statistical power fig 1b a notable exception to this is θs which had a relatively high power despite a small n of 41 this is likely because of the small variability i e σp see table 3 although it is based on only one study examination of the parametric and nonparametric analysis suggests approximate thresholds for an absolute value of cohen s d of 1 25 to 1 5 or p 0 8 to 0 85 for log transformed data of soil hydraulic properties to achieve a power of 0 9 for an n of 20 30 total measurements sum of burned and unburned table 3 figs 5 6 7 when the absolute value of cohen s d or p are approximately 0 7 for log transformed data of soil hydraulic properties the n needed to achieve a power of 0 9 becomes more challenging and can even exceed 100 total measurements table 3 figs 5 6 7 ultimately it is up to the scientist or engineer to decide an appropriate level of type one i e α or two i e power error that is tolerable for the selected application prior to conducting a new field study a review of the literature for typical cohen s d values for log transformed soil hydraulic properties for a given vegetation type climate soil type burn severity or other important factors could be used to provide preliminary guidance on n which could be confirmed with parametric or nonparametric analysis of the type conducted here to assess power at the as sampled n 4 2 the number of infiltration measurements generally needs to increase with time since fire the number of infiltration measurements i e n needed to increase with time since fire to maintain a constant power in all of the post fire studies examined here because the n is often kept constant over time with elapsed time since fire a constant n typically drops below the threshold n to achieve a power of 0 9 fig 10 this is because the effect size i e cohen s d and p typically decrease with time since fire table 3 the rg especially tends to decrease with time since fire and while σp also tends to decrease with time since fire it does not offset the more substantial decrease in rg as the soil hydraulic properties recover nearer to unburned values table 3 one particular anomaly in this trend is that in the ebel 2020b soil hydraulic property data the rg overshoots and the burned kfs exceeds the unburned kfs geometric mean between years 5 and 7 after fire the same phenomenon was present for the unburned s geometric mean from ebel 2020b between years 3 5 after fire in that specific case from ebel 2020b the n to achieve a power of 0 9 decreases with time after fire following the overshoot time as the rg drops further below unity these results indicate that the n for post fire infiltration measurements should likely increase with time since fire in proportion to any decrease in effect size if the goal is to maintain the same power at least until the rg reaches 1 4 3 differences between post fire infiltration measurement methods the differences in measurement variability between infiltration methods lead to critical disparities in the n needed to achieve a power of 0 9 the steady state rainfall simulation method has a clear advantage over both constant or falling head permeameter measurements and tension infiltrometer measurements in terms of achieving a greater power with a smaller n for a given rg figs 9 10 these methodological differences are primarily the result of the substantially smaller variability i e σp in the steady state rainfall simulation method relative to the tension infiltrometer and constant or falling head permeameter measurements table 3 fig 1a 2 9 10 it is not clear if these differences in measurement variability are the result of the generally larger surface area of the steady state simulated rainfall measurements relative to the constant or falling head permeameter measurements and tension infiltrometer measurements table 2 prior work on post fire soil hydraulic properties has shown moderate langhans et al 2016 to weak ebel 2019 effects of the scale of measurement in terms of magnitude and variability measurement method had a greater influence than scale ebel 2019 alternatively the differences between the infiltration measurements methods may be an artifact of the relatively small number of studies examined in this work in that case the inferences drawn regarding methodological differences in power may not be reliably extrapolated beyond this work until further comparisons are done with other data increasing the temporal resolution of tension infiltrometer measurements has been shown to reduce kfs and s variability moody et al 2019 showed that automated high temporal resolution 1 hz tension infiltrometer measurements after wildfire significantly decreased the variability of estimated soil hydraulic properties compared to the usual visual manually recorded measurements this suggests that increasing the accuracy and temporal resolution of tension infiltrometer measurements could also reduce the variability and therefore the n needed to achieve a selected power comparisons of infiltration methods in unburned environments support the findings here of greater variability in tension infiltrometer measurements compared to steady state rainfall simulation morbidelli et al 2017 infiltration analysis in unburned environments has also shown differences between steady state and transient estimates of kfs suggesting that the transient nature of the tension infiltrometer measurements could result in more variable soil hydraulic property estimates di prima et al 2018 overall tension infiltrometer measurements after wildfire tend to be highly variable ebel and moody 2020 kean et al 2019 mcguire et al 2018 moody et al 2019 tang et al 2019 and the implications of this variability for increasing the n needed to achieve a given power are important to consider when selecting a post fire infiltration method the greater variability of post fire tension infiltrometer measurements compared to steady state rainfall simulation may complicate using soil hydraulic properties from tension infiltrometer data in meta analysis and synthesis studies 4 4 implications for syntheses meta analyses and future data collection the results presented have important implications for studies seeking to refine our knowledge through synthesis and meta analysis of existing work and also for future data collection infiltration data after fires and associated estimates of soil hydraulic properties are increasingly used in studies that examine broad trends or gaps e g cerdà and robichaud 2009 ebel and moody 2017 neary 2011 termed synthesis efforts here or meta analyses e g ebel 2019 ebel and martin 2017 that utilize statistical models to draw inferences regarding regional and local factors affecting post fire infiltration or temporal recovery these efforts seldom incorporate the statistical power of the individual studies as a weighting factor in the synthesis or meta analysis yet omitting weighting by statistical power gives equal weight to studies with potentially vast disparities in statistical confidence for distinguishing differences between burned and unburned data perhaps studies with low power should even be excluded entirely from such meta analysis especially when those studies have very small n see fig 1b the statistical analysis in this work is for a relatively limited number of studies that certainly would benefit from further inclusion of datasets however many post fire infiltration studies 1 do not collect unburned samples to compare to preventing accurately assessing the statistical power of the characterization or 2 do not publish the full data only summary statistics in a review of post fire kfs measurement studies from ebel 2019 only 17 sites in 8 separate studies out of 73 sites 23 measured an unburned site for comparison and of these only two benavides solorio and macdonald 2001 ebel et al 2012 had all the data publicly available for analysis further burned unburned comparisons and open publication of post fire infiltration datasets could greatly facilitate more rigorous synthesis and meta analysis studies a final implication of this work was the general agreement between the parametric and nonparametric statistical analysis suggesting that either method provides a reasonable estimate of the n or power for post fire infiltration measurements if a monotonic transformation of the data such as the log transformation used here cannot approximate a normal distribution including the presence of data asymmetry or outliers then the nonparametric test would provide a more accurate characterization of n and power than the parametric approach helsel et al 2020 5 conclusions this work examined the statistical power of soil hydraulic properties estimated following wildland fire for different n of infiltration measurements using previously published data from the literature both parametric two sample t test and nonparametric two group wilcoxon rank sum test statistical techniques were used to assess power and n results showed minimal differences between the power estimates provided by the parametric and nonparametric methods on log transformed soil hydraulic property data approximately half of the studies collected an insufficient number of infiltration measurements to statistically discriminate group differences in soil hydraulic properties of kfs and s with a statistical power of 0 9 or greater and with α of 0 05 this suggests that post fire infiltration studies may need to collect more measurements than is typical to enhance statistical confidence the high variability of post fire kfs and s was a critical factor in the large n needed to achieve a power of 0 9 the much smaller variability in θs resulted in a relatively small n for power equal to 0 9 the rg was also a critical control on n confirming that effect size assessment prior to or concurrent with infiltration measurements would promote achieving acceptable power when estimating soil hydraulic properties after wildfire this work suggests that for a typical post fire study which often has n equal 20 to 30 measurements sum of burned and unburned that the absolute value of cohen s d must be 1 25 to 1 5 or p must be 0 8 to 0 85 for log transformed data of soil hydraulic properties to achieve a power of 0 9 the n typically needed to increase with time since fire to maintain a power of 0 9 because of decreases in effect size cohen s d or p with time since fire this analysis also suggested methodological differences in statistical power with steady state rainfall simulations having greater power than both tension infiltrometers and constant or falling head permeameters for a given n the methodological differences in power were primarily the result of differences in variability for example tension infiltrometer kfs was approximately 4 times more variable than steady state infiltrometer kfs based on median σp the results also suggest that for synthesis and meta analysis efforts that weighting by statistical power could enhance the accuracy and robustness of such analyses for post fire soil hydraulic properties furthermore the large variability in post fire tension infiltrometer measurements and associated soil hydraulic properties of kfs and s may complicate using these data in meta analysis credit authorship contribution

3209,water level fluctuation zone wlfz is a sensitive zone influencing the transformation between sink to source for heavy metals hms which suffers from cyclic inundation and exposure during different hydrological regimes to better understand the geochemical cycling of hms in the wlfz we performed temporal analysis and transport quantification of hms in the world s largest freshwater wlfz three

environmental factors fe and mn oxides soil ph dissolved organic carbon and soil mobility resupply ability multiple models were developed to quantify the hm fluxes in 2019 and 2020 induced by soil

otherwise metal fluxes of wlfz soils into the tgr increased 1 96 times which were attributed to integrated factors including the increase of runoff soil erosion sediment load and remobilization of hms resulting from the catchment wide flood in 2020 in particular the runoff induced labile metals only accounted for 10 of hm fluxes entering the tgr we inferred that catchment wide flood was an important control on hm transport in terrestrial and aquatic systems of the tgr region catchment this study makes a novel contribution to the understanding of the transformation between sink to source

impacts tessier et al 1979 le et al 2004 otherwise during the inundation and drainage processes the mobility of hms can be altered and present a potential threat to the soil and aquatic ecosystem by the changed soil physical and chemical properties ponting et al 2021 such as the soil ph tends to be neutral during the flooding period the initial ph increases or decreases the mobility of metals cations schulz zunkel and krueger 2009 ding et al 2019 ponting et al 2021 fe mn hydroxides reductive dissolution and organic matter decomposition also drive the remobilization of hms in soils or sediments to the porewater which migrate to the aquatic environment during inundation zhou et al 2020 ponting et al 2021 it is particular to note that wlfz of the tgr are exposed during summer and inundated during winter because of which the soil properties of wlfz distinctly differ from normal riparian zone bing et al 2020 otherwise intensification of the extreme rainfall and associated catastrophic flooding is expected to accompany the warming climate tellman et al 2021 the wlfz faced the more complex situation integrated by cyclic regime regulation and extreme catchment wide flooding what impact will it have on the fate of hms in the wlfz of the tgr the increasing frequency of catchment wide flooding donat et al 2016 tellman et al 2021 the potential environmental risks by river damming and flooding events in the future necessitate a comprehensive understanding of hms fate and transport in wlfz and aquatic environment of the tgr region catchment extreme flooding the flood peaked up to 75000 m3 s occurred in the tgr which is the largest water control and hydropower project in the world bing et al 2020 in response to precipitation recorded from july 2 to august 17 2020 across the yangtze river basin which was the largest recorded in the tgr to date this event provided an opportunity to assess the effect and mechanisms of flooding and flow regulation on hm cycles between terrestrial and aquatic system catchment wide soils were sampled from the major tributaries of the tgr pre and post flooding we determined the soil hm as cd cr cu ni pb zn concentrations including total concentration diverse speciation labile concentrations and their partitioning between the solution and solid phase the objectives of this study were to 1 overview the occurrence and the temporal variation in soil hms from 2002 to 2020 and evaluate the hm contamination of the wlfz using the improved enrichment factor model 2 identify the variations in the soil hms mobility of the wlfz after catastrophic flooding 3 elucidate the factors involved in the mobility of hms in wlfz soils and 4 model the fate and transport fluxes of hms in the tgr region catchment yangtze river in 2019 before flood and 2020 after flood this is the first study to reveal the mobility and fate of hms in wlfz soils of the tgr after the catastrophic flooding which are reference value for advanced management strategies to alleviate hms release and pollution risk resulting from dam induced hydrological alterations under the future climate change 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area this study focused on the downstream wlfz 1 7 104 km2 of the tgr region catchment 5 4 104 km2 in the upper reach of the yangtze river fig 1 which is near the dam and easily vulnerable to flow regulation the wlfz of the tgr with a vertical height of 30 m lowest and highest water level of 145 and 175 m a s l is an artificial boundary created by the anti seasonal water level operation after the tgr entered the normal operation in october 2010 bing et al 2020 he et al 2021 serving as a transition between the terrestrial and aquatic environments the wlfz of the tgr displays several unique characteristics such as cyclic exposure summer and submergence winter owing to the reservoir regulation bing et al 2020 exposure to rainfall during the wet seasons bao et al 2015 and the subsequent erosion during rainfall and flooding lin et al 2018 which distinguishes them from the lakes rivers and common reservoirs bao et al 2015 the detailed information about the study area including climate regional landform and geology and land use is described in a previous study bao et al 2015 from july 2 to october 17 2020 a large storm affected the yangtze river catchment leading to widespread flooding in particular on october 20 peak discharge was up to 75000 m3 s in the tgr which was the highest level recorded since the construction of the tgd the inflow and sediment load data in tgr since 2006 are shown in the supporting information fig s1 2 2 sample collection and analysis the sampling sites in the wlfz along the three major tributaries of the tgr included xiangxi meixi and daning river in the wet season of 2019 and 2020 at the water level rise period of the tgr he et al 2021 and the water level between 155 m 160 m surface soil samples 0 20 cm that covered the upper middle and lower reaches of the three rivers were collected from a high elevation plot 165 175 m at the wlfz fig 1 at each site three 5 5 m plots were randomly selected with the distance between each greater than 30 m and at each plot three samples were collected with a plastic shovel and mixed into one soil sample in total 27 soil samples were collected in 2019 and 2020 respectively and samples were placed in clean plastic bags and stored at 4 for further analysis a total of 47 parameters were tested including total contents of hms in soils and porewater multiple speciation of hms in soils and physico chemical properties specifically soil grain sizes soil ph and total and dissolved organic matters toc and doc respectively were measured and the detailed procedures described in previous studies schulz zunkel et al 2013 bing et al 2020 liao et al 2021 comprehensive analyses of total hm contents as cd cr cu ni pb zn fe mn and al multiple fractions acid soluble fraction f1 reducible fraction f2 oxidizable fraction f3 and residual fraction f4 of hms as cd cr cu ni pb and zn labile metal concentrations as cd ni pb fe and mn in soil and total hm content as cd cr cu ni pb fe and mn in pore water were measured in this study the detailed procedures was described in the supporting information total hm contents in soils and porewater labile and multiple fractions of hms in soils were determined using the inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms perkin elmer agilent 7700x quality control was assured by the analysis of duplicate samples blanks and reference materials gbw07358 gbw07359 and bcr701 according to the routine measurement of repeated samples and reference materials the relative standard deviation was below 5 and the recovery of the reference materials was 85 120 2 3 diffusive gradients in thin films dgt induced fluxes in soils and sediments model dgt induced fluxes in soils and sediments model difs was proposed by zhang et al 1998 in order to better understand the dynamic changes of porewater during dgt deployment difs model can be employed to quantify the three possible modes of resupply to the dgt devices which can be determined by r values the ratio of cdgt to the initial porewater concentration csol c0 including 1 r close to 1 indicating the analyte taken up from the solution phase is resupplied from the solid phase at a rate that sustains the initial porewater concentration 2 0 1 r 0 95 indicating there was some resupply from the solid phase but insufficient to maintain the initial csol 3 r 0 1 indicating there is no resupply to the soil solution the dgt is caused solely by diffusion the r is the minimum rdiff which can be obtained by the difs model but the effective hm concentration in the pore water is at the maximum level gao et al 2019 multiple parameters were used to describe the kinetics supply of soils employing difs model zhang et al 1998 wang et al 2018 li et al 2021a kdl partition coefficient defined as the ratio of the solid phase cs to the dissolved concentration csol tc measured and calculated derived by difs model and pc the particle concentration of the soil to describe the kinetics of adsorption rate constant k1 and desorption rate constant k 1 the maximum r rmax indicated there reached equilibrium between the solid and liquid phase of hm concentrations and the lowest effective hm concentrations in the soil solution 2 4 pollution assessment using the improved enrichment factor model in this study the improved enrichment factor model was employed to evaluate the pollution degree of each metal and comprehensive pollution by multiple metals based on the established geochemical baselines li et al 2021b and the detailed processes were described in the supporting information 2 5 heavy metals liberated by soil erosion the lateral transport of hms in the study area induced by soil erosion is calculated based on the soil erosion model and the mean concentrations firstly revised universal soil loss equation rusle model which is the most common with high simulation accuracies ma et al 2021 was used to calculate the amount of average annual soil erosion which was provided as follows 1 a r k l s c p where a represents the amount of average annual soil erosion t hm2 a r represents the rainfall erosivity factor mj mm km2 h a k represents the soil erodibility

is presented below liu et al 2019 2 m i c i a s t where mi represents the fluxes of eroded metal i t a ci represents the average concentration of metal i mg kg a represents the amount of average annual soil erosion t km2 a 102 t hm2 a s represents soil erosion area km2 and t represents unit conversion factor 10 6 2 6 labile metals discharged via runoff and leaching labile metals in soils of tgr region catchment discharged via runoff and leaching in 2019 and 2020 were determined by improving an effective method described by gao et al 2019 during rainfall the released metals in the catchment are related to the rainfall intensity physicochemical characteristics and labile concentrations gao et al 2019 catchment soils can be considered unsaturated and saturated during rainfall and metal concentrations can be obtained in different ways under unsaturated conditions the released soil metals were determined by desorption kinetics and metal concentrations were calculated by the ratio of cdgt to rmax under saturated conditions metals are discharged into the aquatic environment by runoff which can be determined by the ratio of cdgt to rdiff in conclusion the amounts of labile metals released through runoff and leaching can be calculated by the following equations 3 qi r r a i n f a l l a c a t c h m e n t c dgt r max x leaching w runoff c dgt r diff x runoff 4 w runoff 1 e 05 x 3 0 054 x 2 67 668 x 27663 5 x leaching 1 x r u n o f f where q is the amount of labile metals released mg megagram rrainfall is the annual precipitation of the study area in 2019 and 2020 and can be obtained by interpolating monthly monitor data from 14 hydrologic stations mm and the detailed monitoring data is provided in the supporting information fig s2 acatchment represents the area of study m2 w runoff represents the runoff amount from the study area km3 in this study the runoff of the tgr region in 2019 and 2020 was calculated by the equation fitting by runoff and precipitation x of tgr region from 2008 to 2017 fig s3 xleaching and xrunoff represents the contribution to labile metals release when the soil is unsaturated and saturated respectively and the detailed determination can be seen in the supporting information 2 7 erosion and runoff induced heavy metals releases into the tgr the hms released into the tgr induced by soil erosion is shown in the following equation liu et al 2019 6 w i m i s d r where wi represents the erosion induced amount of metal i into the tgr gg sdr is the sediment delivery ratio which is defined as the mass of the sediment input into tgr to the mass of the soil eroded along the tgr region catchment in this study the pre and post flooding sdrs were 0 30 and 0 29 which was consistent with the previous study wang et al 2015 on the other hand runoff induced labile metals could be regarded as the amount of discharging into the tgr 2 8 data analysis in this study temporal variation of hms concentrations from 2002 to 2020 by compiling the monitoring data in 2019 and 2020 and the published data 2002 2016 during the different operating period of the tgr he et al 2021 the supported power generation stage li et al 2005 preliminary operation stage yu et al 2006 experimental impoundment stage and normal operation stage ye et al 2019 significant differences among groups were analyzed by one way analysis of variance anova with independent samples t test pearson s correlation was used between independent variables and the significance of correlations was judged using standard t test and were performed using the origin 2021 software the parameters of the rusle model were calculated using arcgis version 10 3 software and the multiple parameters determination was presented in table s1 3 results 3 1 heavy meal concentrations in wlfz pre and post flooding hm concentrations are summarized in fig 2 and includes the total concentrations fractions and labile concentrations in soils and the total concentrations in the porewater no significant variation was observed in the mean total concentrations between pre and post flooding variance analysis p 0 05 fig 2 and the average hm concentrations exceeded their corresponding local background values except for cr tang et al 2008 fig 3 otherwise the mean values of hms in 2019 and 2020 were compared with the monitoring data of hms in the wlfz soils from 2002 2016 in the previous researches fig 3 mean values of as cr and zn in 2019 and 2020 were higher than their monitoring data of before the impoundment of the tgr while cd cu and pb in 2019 and 2020 were below or equal to their monitoring data of before the impoundment of the tgr li et al 2005 the fluctuation characteristics differed in post flooding labile metals fig 2 compared with pre flooding the hms in post flooding increased ratio by i as 10 05 89 46 1418 85 ii cd 42 66 86 85 646 38 iii ni 47 79 16 85 116 35 and iv pb 6 23 18 63 50 53 but decreased ratio for cu by 13 65 59 96 101 57 similar to the labile concentrations the variations of total concentrations in porewater are shown in fig 2 average concentrations of as cd cr ni and pb in pore water were higher after flooding increased by 32 21 16 11 64 56 93 08 and 50 17 respectively however cu in pore water observed a 33 43 reduction post flooding the hm fractions in soils pre and post flooding vary significantly p 0 05 fig 2 acid soluble fraction and oxidizable fraction of hms were reduced after flooding with a decrease in percentage from 7 27 to 38 77 and from 2 55 to 36 34 respectively in contrast reducible fractions of as cd and ni after flooding observed an increase of 22 42 7 47 and 20 23 than those in 2019 but decreased for cr cu pb and zn post flooding residual metals presented an increase of 13 84 68 05 furthermore most soil hm fractions of wlfz except for cd and pb were dominated by the residual fraction fig 2 cd and pb in wlfz soils require more attention as they account for more than 45 of the average non residual fractions 3 2 contamination assessment using the improved ef model we quantified the possibility of each hm belonging to each enrichment category and also evaluated the comprehensive pollution degree of seven hms fig 4 the results showed no enrichment in ni but as cd cr pb and zn were slightly enriched before and after flooding for cu the contamination degree alleviated from slight enrichment during pre flooding to no enrichment post flooding as cd and pb notably presented probabilities of 0 43 0 45 and 0 37 respectively and deteriorate to the moderate enrichment category the comprehensive enrichment level of hms in soils was further evaluated fig 4 the weight coefficients of cu cr as ni pb zn and cd after flooding were determined using the entropy weight model yielding values of 0 05 0 06 0 15 0 16 0 17 0 19 and 0 21 respectively the weight coefficients of ni zn cu pb cr as and cd before flooding were also determined which yielded 0 09 0 09 0 12 0 12 0 15 0 18 and 0 26 respectively these results suggested that multiple hms in wlfz soils in tgr were slightly enriched furthermore the probability of multiple hms to descent into the moderate enrichment category after flooding was 0 27 3 3 differences in soil physiochemical properties mobility and resupply from solid phase between pre and post flooding sand dominated the composition of grain sizes in wlfz soils of 2019 and 2020 table s2 but the composition of fine particle changed after flooding p 0 05 a significantly lower proportion of clay 2 74 in soils was observed after flooding than that in 2019 9 23 but the average proportion of silt 37 16 after flooding was higher than that in 2019 26 56 the average soil ph 7 28 was lower after flooding than that of 2019 7 78 while the average value of toc 1 05 and doc 24 77 mg l content in soil was higher after flooding compared with those 0 80 and 21 81 mg l respectively in 2019 soil elements including al fe and mn between two sampling periods were also analyzed table s2 average total concentrations of al and fe in soils after flooding were lower than pre flooding concentrations with a decrease percentage of 15 45 and 2 25 respectively while the average total concentration of mn observed a 19 78 increase after flooding similar with the total concentrations a 32 09 reduction in average labile fe but 166 35 increase in average labile mn were observed after flooding furthermore 95 17 and 402 94 increase in pore water fe and mn p 0 05 respectively were observed post flooding resupply ability labile pool size and solid solution partitioning were used to reveal the mobility resupply characteristics of hms as cd cu ni and pb pre and post flooding r values for as cd cu and ni mainly belong to the partially sustained case fig s4 in particular for cd and ni a higher mean r value indicates stronger resupply ability after flooding the r value observed a 79 68 increase in cd 28 37 decrease in ni and remained constant in as cu and pb however the mean r value for pb was 0 09 0 03 0 22 indicating that it mainly was a diffusion only case and the resupply of pb from the solid phase in the wlfz soils was significant and would play an important role in bioavailability wang et al 2018 the decrease in rank of the labile pool size considering the kdl values was as follows fig s4 cd pb ni as cu pre flooding and pb cd ni cu as post flooding it implies that cd pb and ni can strongly desorb from the labile solid phase pool to further resupply the depleted solute metals li et al 2021a furthermore pre and post flooding kdl value varied except for cu 68 07 54 39 61 45 and 46 30 reductions in average kdl values were observed for as cd ni and pb this suggests a decreased post flooding labile pool sizes for as cd ni and pb however the reduction in kdl values is mainly attributed to the increase in pore water concentrations thereby predicting the enhanced abilities of mobility and bioavailability after flooding liao et al 2021 3 4 pre and post flooding heavy metals fluxes induced by erosion runoff and leaching our analysis revealed that catastrophic flooding efficiently flushed significant quantities of hms from the tgr region catchment soil by erosion runoff and leaching on the one hand we identified that a total of 35 27 gg 0 04 11 72 gg hms released in 2020 fig 5 a by soil erosion including 6 90 gg 0 03 1 94 gg of non residual fraction fig 5e with 1 67 fold 1 34 2 05 fold and 1 17 fold 0 28 1 77 fold increase fig 5g respectively these contaminants can be subsequently re deposited or transported into streams liu et al 2019 in total soil erosion released 10 18 gg 0 01 3 38 gg of hms into the tgr fig 5b including 2 0 gg 7 56 559 24 mg non residual fraction in 2019 fig 5f however a total of 25 09 gg 0 03 8 33 gg of the metals including 4 90 gg 0 02 1 17 gg non residual fraction were re deposited onto surface soils accounting for 71 13 of the total hms released by erosion we further focused on the labile contaminants released by the runoff and leaching in 2020 labile metals loads of 209 20 37 69 254 17 799 23 and 39 55 mg were observed for as cd cu ni and pb respectively these labile loads are 5 76 5 38 2 53 5 24 and 3 56 fold higher than those in 2019 fig 5g and may be further transported into the tgr based on our results runoff transports 1 28 gg 36 13 763 98 mg labile metals into the tgr in 2020 fig 5c presenting a 4 98 fold 3 00 6 43 fold increase fig 5g otherwise 61 51 mg 1 55 35 25 mg labile contaminants were leached into the catchment soil presenting a 0 83 fold 0 10 1 53 fold increase than those observed in 2019 4 discussions 4 1 temporal variation of heavy metals in the soils of the wlfz we compiled the monitoring data for different operating stages in the tgr figs 2 and 3 the results show that the hm concentrations in the soils of wlfz consistently increased as cr and zn decreased cd and displayed complex trends cu and pb from 2002 year for three gorges dam tgd establishment to 2020 li et al 2005 ye et al 2019 after tgd s establishment especially after the full operation in 2010 the wlfz has been subjected to a continuous anti seasonal flow regulation for 20 years during the drought rewetting process hms transported by the contaminated soils from erosion and flushed by the flow pulse can be re deposited in the soils of wlfz by sorption complexation precipitation water transport or biological activity the complex influences of human activities annual flood pulse discharge from tributaries and natural processes may enhance the hm contents in topsoil of the wlfz however owing to these complicated interactions not all hms present an increasing trend during different operating periods a higher non residual fraction for cd fig 2 strengthens the mobility which may explain the decreased tendency of its concentration in soils in this study no variation was evidently observed for total hm contents in the soils of wlfz after the catastrophic flooding despite the average contents being lower than the chinese risk screening values for soil contamination mee 2018 the average hm concentrations exceeded the geochemical baselines and local background values except for cr tang et al 2008 comprehensive assessment result using the improved enrichment model further confirmed that hms in the wlfz soils of the tgr were slightly enriched with 0 27 probability to deteriorate to the moderate enrichment fig 4 the major controlling pollutants were as cd and pb considering their higher probability 0 43 0 45 and 0 37 to deterioration 4 2 selective remobilization of heavy metals in soils of the wlfz after flooding considering the multiple chemical forms such as speciation oxidation state and valence we observed a selectively mobilized effect on different hms in wlfz soils after flooding i which was enhanced for as cd cr ni and pb ii and not evident for cu in particular as cd cr ni and pb exhibited enhanced mobility according to the higher labile concentrations e g cd ni reducible factions as cd and ni in soils higher pore water concentrations e g as cr ni pb or lower solid liquid partitioning e g as cd ni moreover higher correlations among labile cd cu and pb were observed after flooding fig s5 which confirms that these metals may be remobilized by similar geochemical factors a fluctuation between inundation and drying affected soil physiochemical properties such as grain size organic matter and fe mn oxides and the variables by flooding e g soil ph potential redox significantly resulting in changes in the amount of dissolved hms further promoting their mobility shaheen et al 2014 schulz zunkel et al 2015 complex drivers of the selective remobilization after the catastrophic flooding in the wlfz of the tgr were revealed including the fe mn oxides ph dissolved organic carbon doc and the kinetics supply among the four impact factors fe mn oxides dominantly affect the mobility of the hms in the soils of the wlfz on the one hand fe mn oxides could release their bound hms by reductive dissolution on the other hand they could also drive the migration and release of hms by interaction with soil ph and doc first fe and mn oxides act as a critical carrier releasing the adsorbed and co precipitated hms hms in soils of wlfz after flooding display a close and positive relationship with fe and mn table 1 including total contents in soils and pore water and labile concentrations fe and mn may precipitate as oxides and bind by desorption or co precipitation to the hms in the solid state furthermore fe and mn oxides change significantly under reducing conditions during the flooding period schulz zunkel and krueger 2009 with enhanced solubility this may directly alter the amount of dissolved and remobilized hms these adsorbed and co precipitated hms may be released by the dissolution of fe and mn oxides under redox conditions abgottspon et al 2015 wisawapipat et al 2021 however cu solubility is curbed after reduction from cu ii to cu i in the presence of electron donors fe ii and bacteria ponting et al 2021 in contrast we observed that labile or pore water hms and labile or pore water fe mn were significantly positively correlated table 1 furthermore fe and mn are critical for total hm concentrations in soils ye et al 2019 bing et al 2020 and our finding provides evidence that fe and mn are factors affecting selective remobilization of hms in pore water and labile speciation in the wlfz soils after the catastrophic flooding second ph decrease is usually accompanied by the enhanced mobility of hm cations here we observed a lower soil ph with a neutral average value of 7 28 after flooding lower soil ph increases the solubility of hms in the soil and decreases the absorption capacity of soil particles shaheen et al 2014 which further results in higher labile and pore water concentrations the increase in cr ni and pb solubility after flooding might be due to the decrease in soil ph which is confirmed by the negative correlations between both pore water or labile metals and ph table 1 in contrast the dissolved fe and mn oxides tend to further reduce the soil ph consequently promoting the remobilization of hms in soils however cu mobility did not significantly vary under reduced soil ph after flooding indicating that solubility or mobility of cu are affected by diverse and complex processes one reason is that the apparent uptake of cu by the soil was due to precipitation of tenorite cuo resulting in reduced solubility above ph 7 8 markiewicz patkowska et al 2005 shaheen et al 2014 another reason is that the relatively insoluble cu2 carbonate mineral are prone to precipitation as the geomorphology in the study area mostly consists of carbonate shaheen et al 2014 bao et al 2015 therefore soil ph was a driver for selective remobilization of hms after the catastrophic flooding third doc increases which chelates and mobilizes hms after flooding doc concentrations were strongly positively correlated with the labile cu and pb table 1 which indicated that cu and pb exhibited strong affinity for organic ligands kelly et al 2020 therefore doc is an important factor contributing to cu and pb mobility in the wlfz soils in contrast considering the significantly positive correlation between doc and labile fe and mn the increased doc may be derived from om bounded to dissolved fe and mn oxyhydroxides shaheen et al 2014 increased concentration of doc in pore water increased the hms contained in the solution to maintain an equilibrium which increases the hms that desorb from soil to replenish the free ion concentrations in the pore water thereby enhancing mobility ponting et al 2021 however the competition of complexation between doc and sorption precipitation to the solid phase can also explain the apparent higher sorption of hms frémion et al 2016 for example cu exhibits a considerably high affinity to complex with dissolved organic matter but reportedly exhibits a strong affinity for sediment organic matter bourgeault et al 2013 coxon et al 2016 therefore the adsorption of cu from the solid phase is counterbalanced resulting in higher solid solution partitioning values liao et al 2021 otherwise not only the hms in the solution but also those that readily desorb from the solid phase could be potentially mobile marrugo madrid et al 2021 following the reactions in soils to maintain equilibrium those adsorbed on the solid phase may be released to replenish the free ion concentrations when the hm concentration in the solution phase is depleted wang et al 2018 li et al 2021a marrugo madrid et al 2021 the resupply ability labile pool size in solid or distribution coefficient vary which facilitates the selective remobilization of hms in the wlfz soils after the catastrophic flooding differing from as cu and pb cd and ni presented a relatively slower decline rate with wider r range and larger r value fig s4 it indicated that cd and ni have a relatively higher abilities to sustain the initial soil solution concentration than the other hms harper et al 2000 which promotes their mobility after the flooding moreover cd ni and pb had larger labile solid pool sizes indicating stronger capacity to resupply the depleted solute metals thereby enhancing the mobility the distribution coefficients of hms were considered to further predict their mobility and bioavailability in soils post flooding kdl values of as cd ni and pb were reduced by 46 30 68 07 due to the increased concentrations in the pore water however constant kdl values were observed for cu therefore the lower resupply ratio smaller solid pool size and the constant distribution coefficients also weaken the mobility of cu in the wlfz soil after flooding 4 3 erosion and runoff induced multiple speciation of hms released into the aquatic environment in total 36 61 gg of hms were released in 2020 including 6 90 gg 0 03 1 94 gg of non residual fraction and 1 34 gg 37 69 799 23 mg of labile metals fig 5 these hms released via erosion and runoff were further transported horizontally we estimated that 11 46 gg of hms are transported into the tgr aquatic environment of which erosion induced residual and non residual fractions accounted for 73 and 17 respectively and 10 were discharged from runoff induced labile metals the rate of total hms released into the tgr after flooding was an approximately 1 96 fold higher than those before flooding whereas approximately 5 fold increase was observed for runoff induced labile metals in 2020 which should be given utmost importance furthermore transport fluxes of total hm content in tgr yangtze river in 2020 was 3 90 fold higher than that in 2019 the results showed that 2 61 gg 3 02 866 59 mg of hms which were transported from the terrestrial ecosystem of the tgr region catchment were released from the tgr and further transported to the downstream of the yangtze river however 74 8 76 2516 09 mg of hms were trapped in the reservoir indicating the significant impact on contaminant transport by the tgd and the result was consistent with a recent study liu et al 2020 furthermore the downstream region of the yangtze river primary contributed to metal flux into the coastal ocean liu et al 2020 the catastrophic flooding in 2020 resulted in 32 of increased flow and 37 of increased sediment load output from the tgr than the mean values from 2003 to 2019 these increments may further enhance riverbed erosion and tss concentrations rendering them incapable of transferring contaminants downstream of the dam yang et al 2014 liu et al 2020 consequently the influence on transport of contaminants to the coastal ocean was enhanced by increasing the metal fluxes from the down section of the yangtze river in 2020 5 conclusions this is the first report to elucidate the occurrence mobility transport fluxes of hms in the wlfz soils which experienced the reservoir regulation and extreme flooding although no obvious variation was observed in the total hm concentrations in soils of the wlfz the hms were selectively remobilized after the flooding hm mobility was enhanced in 2020 but not for all metals such as cu fe mn oxides ph doc and the kinetics supply of the soils were the four environmental factors that influenced the selective remobilization of hms and were dominated by fe mn oxides in 2020 11 46 gg of hms are transported into the tgr aquatic environment of which erosion induced residual and non residual fractions accounted for 73 and 17 respectively and 10 were discharged from runoff induced labile metals the rate of total hms released into the tgr after flooding was approximately 1 96 fold higher than those before flooding promotion of metal fluxes was attributed to the altered hydrological and geochemical factors such as the runoff soil erosion sediment load and the remobilization of the hms after flooding overall hm transport from the wlfz soils into the aquatic environment of the tgr and its downstream section was promoted after

3209,water level fluctuation zone wlfz is a sensitive zone influencing the transformation between sink to source for heavy metals hms which suffers from cyclic inundation and exposure during different hydrological regimes to better understand the geochemical cycling of hms in the wlfz we performed temporal analysis and transport quantification of hms in the world s largest freshwater wlfz three gorges reservoir tgr china from 2002 to 2020 hm contents in wlfz soils fluctuated and gradually stabilized in 2020 selective remobilization of hms was observed which were mainly influenced by four environmental factors fe and mn oxides soil ph dissolved organic carbon and soil mobility resupply ability multiple models were developed to quantify the hm fluxes in 2019 and 2020 induced by soil erosion runoff and leaching in 2020 hms liberated in the tgr region catchment increased from 13 35 2019 to 36 61 gigagram gg including 6 90 gg of non residual fraction and 1 34 gg of labile metals otherwise metal fluxes of wlfz soils into the tgr increased 1 96 times which were attributed to integrated factors including the increase of runoff soil erosion sediment load and remobilization of hms resulting from the catchment wide flood in 2020 in particular the runoff induced labile metals only accounted for 10 of hm fluxes entering the tgr we inferred that catchment wide flood was an important control on hm transport in terrestrial and aquatic systems of the tgr region catchment this study makes a novel contribution to the understanding of the transformation between sink to source of the wlfz and for targeted management of its ecological and environmental impact keywords heavy metals water level fluctuation zone three gorges reservoir selective remobilization transport fluxes data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction for millennia 2 8 million dams with reservoirs areas over 103 m2 for meeting the needs for growing economies flood control and ecological protection lehner et al 2011 merz et al 2021 as a result the typography and environment of river were disturbed by the cyclically hydrological regime grill et al 2019 water level fluctuation zone wlfz which was a transition zone between terrestrial and aquatic system was performed by different hydrological regime bing et al 2019 as the sensitive zone experiences the coupled effects of drought rewetting process from reservoir and occasional flood pulses wlfz plays an important role in pollutants cycling between terrestrial and aquatic systems bao et al 2018 bing et al 2019 previous studies have mostly focused on the geochemical cycling for major elements in the river such as carbon phosphorus nitrogen and silicon maavara et al 2020 keller et al 2021 with only few studies being aimed at heavy metals as cd cr cu pb zn and hg however there are more limited studies on the more complex interaction between reservoir regulation and flood for hms transport in the wlfz the anti seasonal regulation of water level in the three gorges reservoir tgr forms a unique and largest freshwater wlfz in the world bao et al 2015 recently hms contamination in the wlfz has become a research hotspot bing et al 2019 ye et al 2019 bing et al 2020 where flow regulation is one of the factors contributing to the distribution of hm contaminants in the wlfz soils of the tgr previous researches mostly focused on spatiotemporal analysis or pollution assessment based on the total hm contents however the mobility or bioavailability of hms is influenced by its speciation in soil not merely the total concentrations gao et al 2020 there are differences in the migration and release characteristics for different speciation of hms especially corresponding ecological and environmental impacts tessier et al 1979 le et al 2004 otherwise during the inundation and drainage processes the mobility of hms can be altered and present a potential threat to the soil and aquatic ecosystem by the changed soil physical and chemical properties ponting et al 2021 such as the soil ph tends to be neutral during the flooding period the initial ph increases or decreases the mobility of metals cations schulz zunkel and krueger 2009 ding et al 2019 ponting et al 2021 fe mn hydroxides reductive dissolution and organic matter decomposition also drive the remobilization of hms in soils or sediments to the porewater which migrate to the aquatic environment during inundation zhou et al 2020 ponting et al 2021 it is particular to note that wlfz of the tgr are exposed during summer and inundated during winter because of which the soil properties of wlfz distinctly differ from normal riparian zone bing et al 2020 otherwise intensification of the extreme rainfall and associated catastrophic flooding is expected to accompany the warming climate tellman et al 2021 the wlfz faced the more complex situation integrated by cyclic regime regulation and extreme catchment wide flooding what impact will it have on the fate of hms in the wlfz of the tgr the increasing frequency of catchment wide flooding donat et al 2016 tellman et al 2021 the potential environmental risks by river damming and flooding events in the future necessitate a comprehensive understanding of hms fate and transport in wlfz and aquatic environment of the tgr region catchment extreme flooding the flood peaked up to 75000 m3 s occurred in the tgr which is the largest water control and hydropower project in the world bing et al 2020 in response to precipitation recorded from july 2 to august 17 2020 across the yangtze river basin which was the largest recorded in the tgr to date this event provided an opportunity to assess the effect and mechanisms of flooding and flow regulation on hm cycles between terrestrial and aquatic system catchment wide soils were sampled from the major tributaries of the tgr pre and post flooding we determined the soil hm as cd cr cu ni pb zn concentrations including total concentration diverse speciation labile concentrations and their partitioning between the solution and solid phase the objectives of this study were to 1 overview the occurrence and the temporal variation in soil hms from 2002 to 2020 and evaluate the hm contamination of the wlfz using the improved enrichment factor model 2 identify the variations in the soil hms mobility of the wlfz after catastrophic flooding 3 elucidate the factors involved in the mobility of hms in wlfz soils and 4 model the fate and transport fluxes of hms in the tgr region catchment yangtze river in 2019 before flood and 2020 after flood this is the first study to reveal the mobility and fate of hms in wlfz soils of the tgr after the catastrophic flooding which are reference value for advanced management strategies to alleviate hms release and pollution risk resulting from dam induced hydrological alterations under the future climate change 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area this study focused on the downstream wlfz 1 7 104 km2 of the tgr region catchment 5 4 104 km2 in the upper reach of the yangtze river fig 1 which is near the dam and easily vulnerable to flow regulation the wlfz of the tgr with a vertical height of 30 m lowest and highest water level of 145 and 175 m a s l is an artificial boundary created by the anti seasonal water level operation after the tgr entered the normal operation in october 2010 bing et al 2020 he et al 2021 serving as a transition between the terrestrial and aquatic environments the wlfz of the tgr displays several unique characteristics such as cyclic exposure summer and submergence winter owing to the reservoir regulation bing et al 2020 exposure to rainfall during the wet seasons bao et al 2015 and the subsequent erosion during rainfall and flooding lin et al 2018 which distinguishes them from the lakes rivers and common reservoirs bao et al 2015 the detailed information about the study area including climate regional landform and geology and land use is described in a previous study bao et al 2015 from july 2 to october 17 2020 a large storm affected the yangtze river catchment leading to widespread flooding in particular on october 20 peak discharge was up to 75000 m3 s in the tgr which was the highest level recorded since the construction of the tgd the inflow and sediment load data in tgr since 2006 are shown in the supporting information fig s1 2 2 sample collection and analysis the sampling sites in the wlfz along the three major tributaries of the tgr included xiangxi meixi and daning river in the wet season of 2019 and 2020 at the water level rise period of the tgr he et al 2021 and the water level between 155 m 160 m surface soil samples 0 20 cm that covered the upper middle and lower reaches of the three rivers were collected from a high elevation plot 165 175 m at the wlfz fig 1 at each site three 5 5 m plots were randomly selected with the distance between each greater than 30 m and at each plot three samples were collected with a plastic shovel and mixed into one soil sample in total 27 soil samples were collected in 2019 and 2020 respectively and samples were placed in clean plastic bags and stored at 4 for further analysis a total of 47 parameters were tested including total contents of hms in soils and porewater multiple speciation of hms in soils and physico chemical properties specifically soil grain sizes soil ph and total and dissolved organic matters toc and doc respectively were measured and the detailed procedures described in previous studies schulz zunkel et al 2013 bing et al 2020 liao et al 2021 comprehensive analyses of total hm contents as cd cr cu ni pb zn fe mn and al multiple fractions acid soluble fraction f1 reducible fraction f2 oxidizable fraction f3 and residual fraction f4 of hms as cd cr cu ni pb and zn labile metal concentrations as cd ni pb fe and mn in soil and total hm content as cd cr cu ni pb fe and mn in pore water were measured in this study the detailed procedures was described in the supporting information total hm contents in soils and porewater labile and multiple fractions of hms in soils were determined using the inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms perkin elmer agilent 7700x quality control was assured by the analysis of duplicate samples blanks and reference materials gbw07358 gbw07359 and bcr701 according to the routine measurement of repeated samples and reference materials the relative standard deviation was below 5 and the recovery of the reference materials was 85 120 2 3 diffusive gradients in thin films dgt induced fluxes in soils and sediments model dgt induced fluxes in soils and sediments model difs was proposed by zhang et al 1998 in order to better understand the dynamic changes of porewater during dgt deployment difs model can be employed to quantify the three possible modes of resupply to the dgt devices which can be determined by r values the ratio of cdgt to the initial porewater concentration csol c0 including 1 r close to 1 indicating the analyte taken up from the solution phase is resupplied from the solid phase at a rate that sustains the initial porewater concentration 2 0 1 r 0 95 indicating there was some resupply from the solid phase but insufficient to maintain the initial csol 3 r 0 1 indicating there is no resupply to the soil solution the dgt is caused solely by diffusion the r is the minimum rdiff which can be obtained by the difs model but the effective hm concentration in the pore water is at the maximum level gao et al 2019 multiple parameters were used to describe the kinetics supply of soils employing difs model zhang et al 1998 wang et al 2018 li et al 2021a kdl partition coefficient defined as the ratio of the solid phase cs to the dissolved concentration csol tc measured and calculated derived by difs model and pc the particle concentration of the soil to describe the kinetics of adsorption rate constant k1 and desorption rate constant k 1 the maximum r rmax indicated there reached equilibrium between the solid and liquid phase of hm concentrations and the lowest effective hm concentrations in the soil solution 2 4 pollution assessment using the improved enrichment factor model in this study the improved enrichment factor model was employed to evaluate the pollution degree of each metal and comprehensive pollution by multiple metals based on the established geochemical baselines li et al 2021b and the detailed processes were described in the supporting information 2 5 heavy metals liberated by soil erosion the lateral transport of hms in the study area induced by soil erosion is calculated based on the soil erosion model and the mean concentrations firstly revised universal soil loss equation rusle model which is the most common with high simulation accuracies ma et al 2021 was used to calculate the amount of average annual soil erosion which was provided as follows 1 a r k l s c p where a represents the amount of average annual soil erosion t hm2 a r represents the rainfall erosivity factor mj mm km2 h a k represents the soil erodibility factor t km2 h km2 mj mm ls represents the terrain factor c represents the vegetation cover factor and p represents the governance factor second the erosional components of soil hms were derived and is presented below liu et al 2019 2 m i c i a s t where mi represents the fluxes of eroded metal i t a ci represents the average concentration of metal i mg kg a represents the amount of average annual soil erosion t km2 a 102 t hm2 a s represents soil erosion area km2 and t represents unit conversion factor 10 6 2 6 labile metals discharged via runoff and leaching labile metals in soils of tgr region catchment discharged via runoff and leaching in 2019 and 2020 were determined by improving an effective method described by gao et al 2019 during rainfall the released metals in the catchment are related to the rainfall intensity physicochemical characteristics and labile concentrations gao et al 2019 catchment soils can be considered unsaturated and saturated during rainfall and metal concentrations can be obtained in different ways under unsaturated conditions the released soil metals were determined by desorption kinetics and metal concentrations were calculated by the ratio of cdgt to rmax under saturated conditions metals are discharged into the aquatic environment by runoff which can be determined by the ratio of cdgt to rdiff in conclusion the amounts of labile metals released through runoff and leaching can be calculated by the following equations 3 qi r r a i n f a l l a c a t c h m e n t c dgt r max x leaching w runoff c dgt r diff x runoff 4 w runoff 1 e 05 x 3 0 054 x 2 67 668 x 27663 5 x leaching 1 x r u n o f f where q is the amount of labile metals released mg megagram rrainfall is the annual precipitation of the study area in 2019 and 2020 and can be obtained by interpolating monthly monitor data from 14 hydrologic stations mm and the detailed monitoring data is provided in the supporting information fig s2 acatchment represents the area of study m2 w runoff represents the runoff amount from the study area km3 in this study the runoff of the tgr region in 2019 and 2020 was calculated by the equation fitting by runoff and precipitation x of tgr region from 2008 to 2017 fig s3 xleaching and xrunoff represents the contribution to labile metals release when the soil is unsaturated and saturated respectively and the detailed determination can be seen in the supporting information 2 7 erosion and runoff induced heavy metals releases into the tgr the hms released into the tgr induced by soil erosion is shown in the following equation liu et al 2019 6 w i m i s d r where wi represents the erosion induced amount of metal i into the tgr gg sdr is the sediment delivery ratio which is defined as the mass of the sediment input into tgr to the mass of the soil eroded along the tgr region catchment in this study the pre and post flooding sdrs were 0 30 and 0 29 which was consistent with the previous study wang et al 2015 on the other hand runoff induced labile metals could be regarded as the amount of discharging into the tgr 2 8 data analysis in this study temporal variation of hms concentrations from 2002 to 2020 by compiling the monitoring data in 2019 and 2020 and the published data 2002 2016 during the different operating period of the tgr he et al 2021 the supported power generation stage li et al 2005 preliminary operation stage yu et al 2006 experimental impoundment stage and normal operation stage ye et al 2019 significant differences among groups were analyzed by one way analysis of variance anova with independent samples t test pearson s correlation was used between independent variables and the significance of correlations was judged using standard t test and were performed using the origin 2021 software the parameters of the rusle model were calculated using arcgis version 10 3 software and the multiple parameters determination was presented in table s1 3 results 3 1 heavy meal concentrations in wlfz pre and post flooding hm concentrations are summarized in fig 2 and includes the total concentrations fractions and labile concentrations in soils and the total concentrations in the porewater no significant variation was observed in the mean total concentrations between pre and post flooding variance analysis p 0 05 fig 2 and the average hm concentrations exceeded their corresponding local background values except for cr tang et al 2008 fig 3 otherwise the mean values of hms in 2019 and 2020 were compared with the monitoring data of hms in the wlfz soils from 2002 2016 in the previous researches fig 3 mean values of as cr and zn in 2019 and 2020 were higher than their monitoring data of before the impoundment of the tgr while cd cu and pb in 2019 and 2020 were below or equal to their monitoring data of before the impoundment of the tgr li et al 2005 the fluctuation characteristics differed in post flooding labile metals fig 2 compared with pre flooding the hms in post flooding increased ratio by i as 10 05 89 46 1418 85 ii cd 42 66 86 85 646 38 iii ni 47 79 16 85 116 35 and iv pb 6 23 18 63 50 53 but decreased ratio for cu by 13 65 59 96 101 57 similar to the labile concentrations the variations of total concentrations in porewater are shown in fig 2 average concentrations of as cd cr ni and pb in pore water were higher after flooding increased by 32 21 16 11 64 56 93 08 and 50 17 respectively however cu in pore water observed a 33 43 reduction post flooding the hm fractions in soils pre and post flooding vary significantly p 0 05 fig 2 acid soluble fraction and oxidizable fraction of hms were reduced after flooding with a decrease in percentage from 7 27 to 38 77 and from 2 55 to 36 34 respectively in contrast reducible fractions of as cd and ni after flooding observed an increase of 22 42 7 47 and 20 23 than those in 2019 but decreased for cr cu pb and zn post flooding residual metals presented an increase of 13 84 68 05 furthermore most soil hm fractions of wlfz except for cd and pb were dominated by the residual fraction fig 2 cd and pb in wlfz soils require more attention as they account for more than 45 of the average non residual fractions 3 2 contamination assessment using the improved ef model we quantified the possibility of each hm belonging to each enrichment category and also evaluated the comprehensive pollution degree of seven hms fig 4 the results showed no enrichment in ni but as cd cr pb and zn were slightly enriched before and after flooding for cu the contamination degree alleviated from slight enrichment during pre flooding to no enrichment post flooding as cd and pb notably presented probabilities of 0 43 0 45 and 0 37 respectively and deteriorate to the moderate enrichment category the comprehensive enrichment level of hms in soils was further evaluated fig 4 the weight coefficients of cu cr as ni pb zn and cd after flooding were determined using the entropy weight model yielding values of 0 05 0 06 0 15 0 16 0 17 0 19 and 0 21 respectively the weight coefficients of ni zn cu pb cr as and cd before flooding were also determined which yielded 0 09 0 09 0 12 0 12 0 15 0 18 and 0 26 respectively these results suggested that multiple hms in wlfz soils in tgr were slightly enriched furthermore the probability of multiple hms to descent into the moderate enrichment category after flooding was 0 27 3 3 differences in soil physiochemical properties mobility and resupply from solid phase between pre and post flooding sand dominated the composition of grain sizes in wlfz soils of 2019 and 2020 table s2 but the composition of fine particle changed after flooding p 0 05 a significantly lower proportion of clay 2 74 in soils was observed after flooding than that in 2019 9 23 but the average proportion of silt 37 16 after flooding was higher than that in 2019 26 56 the average soil ph 7 28 was lower after flooding than that of 2019 7 78 while the average value of toc 1 05 and doc 24 77 mg l content in soil was higher after flooding compared with those 0 80 and 21 81 mg l respectively in 2019 soil elements including al fe and mn between two sampling periods were also analyzed table s2 average total concentrations of al and fe in soils after flooding were lower than pre flooding concentrations with a decrease percentage of 15 45 and 2 25 respectively while the average total concentration of mn observed a 19 78 increase after flooding similar with the total concentrations a 32 09 reduction in average labile fe but 166 35 increase in average labile mn were observed after flooding furthermore 95 17 and 402 94 increase in pore water fe and mn p 0 05 respectively were observed post flooding resupply ability labile pool size and solid solution partitioning were used to reveal the mobility resupply characteristics of hms as cd cu ni and pb pre and post flooding r values for as cd cu and ni mainly belong to the partially sustained case fig s4 in particular for cd and ni a higher mean r value indicates stronger resupply ability after flooding the r value observed a 79 68 increase in cd 28 37 decrease in ni and remained constant in as cu and pb however the mean r value for pb was 0 09 0 03 0 22 indicating that it mainly was a diffusion only case and the resupply of pb from the solid phase in the wlfz soils was significant and would play an important role in bioavailability wang et al 2018 the decrease in rank of the labile pool size considering the kdl values was as follows fig s4 cd pb ni as cu pre flooding and pb cd ni cu as post flooding it implies that cd pb and ni can strongly desorb from the labile solid phase pool to further resupply the depleted solute metals li et al 2021a furthermore pre and post flooding kdl value varied except for cu 68 07 54 39 61 45 and 46 30 reductions in average kdl values were observed for as cd ni and pb this suggests a decreased post flooding labile pool sizes for as cd ni and pb however the reduction in kdl values is mainly attributed to the increase in pore water concentrations thereby predicting the enhanced abilities of mobility and bioavailability after flooding liao et al 2021 3 4 pre and post flooding heavy metals fluxes induced by erosion runoff and leaching our analysis revealed that catastrophic flooding efficiently flushed significant quantities of hms from the tgr region catchment soil by erosion runoff and leaching on the one hand we identified that a total of 35 27 gg 0 04 11 72 gg hms released in 2020 fig 5 a by soil erosion including 6 90 gg 0 03 1 94 gg of non residual fraction fig 5e with 1 67 fold 1 34 2 05 fold and 1 17 fold 0 28 1 77 fold increase fig 5g respectively these contaminants can be subsequently re deposited or transported into streams liu et al 2019 in total soil erosion released 10 18 gg 0 01 3 38 gg of hms into the tgr fig 5b including 2 0 gg 7 56 559 24 mg non residual fraction in 2019 fig 5f however a total of 25 09 gg 0 03 8 33 gg of the metals including 4 90 gg 0 02 1 17 gg non residual fraction were re deposited onto surface soils accounting for 71 13 of the total hms released by erosion we further focused on the labile contaminants released by the runoff and leaching in 2020 labile metals loads of 209 20 37 69 254 17 799 23 and 39 55 mg were observed for as cd cu ni and pb respectively these labile loads are 5 76 5 38 2 53 5 24 and 3 56 fold higher than those in 2019 fig 5g and may be further transported into the tgr based on our results runoff transports 1 28 gg 36 13 763 98 mg labile metals into the tgr in 2020 fig 5c presenting a 4 98 fold 3 00 6 43 fold increase fig 5g otherwise 61 51 mg 1 55 35 25 mg labile contaminants were leached into the catchment soil presenting a 0 83 fold 0 10 1 53 fold increase than those observed in 2019 4 discussions 4 1 temporal variation of heavy metals in the soils of the wlfz we compiled the monitoring data for different operating stages in the tgr figs 2 and 3 the results show that the hm concentrations in the soils of wlfz consistently increased as cr and zn decreased cd and displayed complex trends cu and pb from 2002 year for three gorges dam tgd establishment to 2020 li et al 2005 ye et al 2019 after tgd s establishment especially after the full operation in 2010 the wlfz has been subjected to a continuous anti seasonal flow regulation for 20 years during the drought rewetting process hms transported by the contaminated soils from erosion and flushed by the flow pulse can be re deposited in the soils of wlfz by sorption complexation precipitation water transport or biological activity the complex influences of human activities annual flood pulse discharge from tributaries and natural processes may enhance the hm contents in topsoil of the wlfz however owing to these complicated interactions not all hms present an increasing trend during different operating periods a higher non residual fraction for cd fig 2 strengthens the mobility which may explain the decreased tendency of its concentration in soils in this study no variation was evidently observed for total hm contents in the soils of wlfz after the catastrophic flooding despite the average contents being lower than the chinese risk screening values for soil contamination mee 2018 the average hm concentrations exceeded the geochemical baselines and local background values except for cr tang et al 2008 comprehensive assessment result using the improved enrichment model further confirmed that hms in the wlfz soils of the tgr were slightly enriched with 0 27 probability to deteriorate to the moderate enrichment fig 4 the major controlling pollutants were as cd and pb considering their higher probability 0 43 0 45 and 0 37 to deterioration 4 2 selective remobilization of heavy metals in soils of the wlfz after flooding considering the multiple chemical forms such as speciation oxidation state and valence we observed a selectively mobilized effect on different hms in wlfz soils after flooding i which was enhanced for as cd cr ni and pb ii and not evident for cu in particular as cd cr ni and pb exhibited enhanced mobility according to the higher labile concentrations e g cd ni reducible factions as cd and ni in soils higher pore water concentrations e g as cr ni pb or lower solid liquid partitioning e g as cd ni moreover higher correlations among labile cd cu and pb were observed after flooding fig s5 which confirms that these metals may be remobilized by similar geochemical factors a fluctuation between inundation and drying affected soil physiochemical properties such as grain size organic matter and fe mn oxides and the variables by flooding e g soil ph potential redox significantly resulting in changes in the amount of dissolved hms further promoting their mobility shaheen et al 2014 schulz zunkel et al 2015 complex drivers of the selective remobilization after the catastrophic flooding in the wlfz of the tgr were revealed including the fe mn oxides ph dissolved organic carbon doc and the kinetics supply among the four impact factors fe mn oxides dominantly affect the mobility of the hms in the soils of the wlfz on the one hand fe mn oxides could release their bound hms by reductive dissolution on the other hand they could also drive the migration and release of hms by interaction with soil ph and doc first fe and mn oxides act as a critical carrier releasing the adsorbed and co precipitated hms hms in soils of wlfz after flooding display a close and positive relationship with fe and mn table 1 including total contents in soils and pore water and labile concentrations fe and mn may precipitate as oxides and bind by desorption or co precipitation to the hms in the solid state furthermore fe and mn oxides change significantly under reducing conditions during the flooding period schulz zunkel and krueger 2009 with enhanced solubility this may directly alter the amount of dissolved and remobilized hms these adsorbed and co precipitated hms may be released by the dissolution of fe and mn oxides under redox conditions abgottspon et al 2015 wisawapipat et al 2021 however cu solubility is curbed after reduction from cu ii to cu i in the presence of electron donors fe ii and bacteria ponting et al 2021 in contrast we observed that labile or pore water hms and labile or pore water fe mn were significantly positively correlated table 1 furthermore fe and mn are critical for total hm concentrations in soils ye et al 2019 bing et al 2020 and our finding provides evidence that fe and mn are factors affecting selective remobilization of hms in pore water and labile speciation in the wlfz soils after the catastrophic flooding second ph decrease is usually accompanied by the enhanced mobility of hm cations here we observed a lower soil ph with a neutral average value of 7 28 after flooding lower soil ph increases the solubility of hms in the soil and decreases the absorption capacity of soil particles shaheen et al 2014 which further results in higher labile and pore water concentrations the increase in cr ni and pb solubility after flooding might be due to the decrease in soil ph which is confirmed by the negative correlations between both pore water or labile metals and ph table 1 in contrast the dissolved fe and mn oxides tend to further reduce the soil ph consequently promoting the remobilization of hms in soils however cu mobility did not significantly vary under reduced soil ph after flooding indicating that solubility or mobility of cu are affected by diverse and complex processes one reason is that the apparent uptake of cu by the soil was due to precipitation of tenorite cuo resulting in reduced solubility above ph 7 8 markiewicz patkowska et al 2005 shaheen et al 2014 another reason is that the relatively insoluble cu2 carbonate mineral are prone to precipitation as the geomorphology in the study area mostly consists of carbonate shaheen et al 2014 bao et al 2015 therefore soil ph was a driver for selective remobilization of hms after the catastrophic flooding third doc increases which chelates and mobilizes hms after flooding doc concentrations were strongly positively correlated with the labile cu and pb table 1 which indicated that cu and pb exhibited strong affinity for organic ligands kelly et al 2020 therefore doc is an important factor contributing to cu and pb mobility in the wlfz soils in contrast considering the significantly positive correlation between doc and labile fe and mn the increased doc may be derived from om bounded to dissolved fe and mn oxyhydroxides shaheen et al 2014 increased concentration of doc in pore water increased the hms contained in the solution to maintain an equilibrium which increases the hms that desorb from soil to replenish the free ion concentrations in the pore water thereby enhancing mobility ponting et al 2021 however the competition of complexation between doc and sorption precipitation to the solid phase can also explain the apparent higher sorption of hms frémion et al 2016 for example cu exhibits a considerably high affinity to complex with dissolved organic matter but reportedly exhibits a strong affinity for sediment organic matter bourgeault et al 2013 coxon et al 2016 therefore the adsorption of cu from the solid phase is counterbalanced resulting in higher solid solution partitioning values liao et al 2021 otherwise not only the hms in the solution but also those that readily desorb from the solid phase could be potentially mobile marrugo madrid et al 2021 following the reactions in soils to maintain equilibrium those adsorbed on the solid phase may be released to replenish the free ion concentrations when the hm concentration in the solution phase is depleted wang et al 2018 li et al 2021a marrugo madrid et al 2021 the resupply ability labile pool size in solid or distribution coefficient vary which facilitates the selective remobilization of hms in the wlfz soils after the catastrophic flooding differing from as cu and pb cd and ni presented a relatively slower decline rate with wider r range and larger r value fig s4 it indicated that cd and ni have a relatively higher abilities to sustain the initial soil solution concentration than the other hms harper et al 2000 which promotes their mobility after the flooding moreover cd ni and pb had larger labile solid pool sizes indicating stronger capacity to resupply the depleted solute metals thereby enhancing the mobility the distribution coefficients of hms were considered to further predict their mobility and bioavailability in soils post flooding kdl values of as cd ni and pb were reduced by 46 30 68 07 due to the increased concentrations in the pore water however constant kdl values were observed for cu therefore the lower resupply ratio smaller solid pool size and the constant distribution coefficients also weaken the mobility of cu in the wlfz soil after flooding 4 3 erosion and runoff induced multiple speciation of hms released into the aquatic environment in total 36 61 gg of hms were released in 2020 including 6 90 gg 0 03 1 94 gg of non residual fraction and 1 34 gg 37 69 799 23 mg of labile metals fig 5 these hms released via erosion and runoff were further transported horizontally we estimated that 11 46 gg of hms are transported into the tgr aquatic environment of which erosion induced residual and non residual fractions accounted for 73 and 17 respectively and 10 were discharged from runoff induced labile metals the rate of total hms released into the tgr after flooding was an approximately 1 96 fold higher than those before flooding whereas approximately 5 fold increase was observed for runoff induced labile metals in 2020 which should be given utmost importance furthermore transport fluxes of total hm content in tgr yangtze river in 2020 was 3 90 fold higher than that in 2019 the results showed that 2 61 gg 3 02 866 59 mg of hms which were transported from the terrestrial ecosystem of the tgr region catchment were released from the tgr and further transported to the downstream of the yangtze river however 74 8 76 2516 09 mg of hms were trapped in the reservoir indicating the significant impact on contaminant transport by the tgd and the result was consistent with a recent study liu et al 2020 furthermore the downstream region of the yangtze river primary contributed to metal flux into the coastal ocean liu et al 2020 the catastrophic flooding in 2020 resulted in 32 of increased flow and 37 of increased sediment load output from the tgr than the mean values from 2003 to 2019 these increments may further enhance riverbed erosion and tss concentrations rendering them incapable of transferring contaminants downstream of the dam yang et al 2014 liu et al 2020 consequently the influence on transport of contaminants to the coastal ocean was enhanced by increasing the metal fluxes from the down section of the yangtze river in 2020 5 conclusions this is the first report to elucidate the occurrence mobility transport fluxes of hms in the wlfz soils which experienced the reservoir regulation and extreme flooding although no obvious variation was observed in the total hm concentrations in soils of the wlfz the hms were selectively remobilized after the flooding hm mobility was enhanced in 2020 but not for all metals such as cu fe mn oxides ph doc and the kinetics supply of the soils were the four environmental factors that influenced the selective remobilization of hms and were dominated by fe mn oxides in 2020 11 46 gg of hms are transported into the tgr aquatic environment of which erosion induced residual and non residual fractions accounted for 73 and 17 respectively and 10 were discharged from runoff induced labile metals the rate of total hms released into the tgr after flooding was approximately 1 96 fold higher than those before flooding promotion of metal fluxes was attributed to the altered hydrological and geochemical factors such as the runoff soil erosion sediment load and the remobilization of the hms after flooding overall hm transport from the wlfz soils into the aquatic environment of the tgr and its downstream section was promoted after the catastrophic flooding the results provide a better understanding on the fate and transport of hms in the catchment wide terrestrial and aquatic environment under varying hydrology regimes which assists in targeted management of the catchment environment credit authorship contribution statement yanyan li investigation methodology writing original draft bo gao supervision methodology formal
