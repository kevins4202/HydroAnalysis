9225,soil bacteria and fungi play key roles in organic matter decomposition and nutrient turnover aerated drip irrigation adi is beneficial for improving soil nutrients but its effects on bacterial and fungal communities are less known in this study a two season adi field experiment comprising three dissolved oxygen concentrations 10 15 and 20 mg l 1 referred to as a1 a2 and a3 and a control treatment groundwater without aerated ck was conducted in a tomato plantation in shandong china soil bacterial and fungal communities were examined using high throughput sequencing targeting 16 s rrna and its genes respectively the adi treatments increased fungal community diversity but did not significantly affect bacterial community diversity however bacterial communities were more connected within the module with more stable network structures in the adi treatments in contrast fungal networks had lower modularity values and a significant negative correlation with soil available phosphorus ap the adi treatments increased the bacterial phylum gemmatimonadetes and firmicutes and a few aerobic taxa and strongly enriched the fungal phylum mortierellomycota and phosphorus dissolving taxa humicola mycothermus and myceliophthora in addition the a2 treatment enhanced functional groups related to carbon and phosphorus cycling while decreasing plant pathogen functional groups the most important environmental factors affecting bacterial and fungal communities were soil organic carbon soc and ap respectively structural equation modeling sem demonstrated that adi directly affected soil bacterial and fungal communities and indirectly promoted soc ap content and tomato yield overall our findings highlight the importance of bacterial and fungal taxonomic communities co occurrence networks and functions related to regulating soil carbon and phosphorus availability providing novel evidence for the application of adi to improve soil fertility and crop productivity graphical abstract ga1 keywords aerated drip irrigation soil bacteria and fungi taxonomic composition co occurrence networks functions soil carbon and phosphorus availability data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction intensive agricultural production has degraded soils decreasing soil productivity in many parts of the world kheirfam et al 2017 lekberg et al 2021 including fluvo aquic soils in northern china tomato a cash crop is widely grown in temperate and subtropical regions however tomato cropping systems are susceptible to rhizosphere hypoxia stress due to intensive tillage short crop rotations and mechanical compaction practices that reduce soil quality and crop productivity in the long term du et al 2020 jiang et al 2019 increased aeration in the rhizosphere can improve soil fertility baram et al 2021 aerated drip irrigation adi is a technique that uses micro bubbles to deliver oxygen enhanced water to the root zones of plants improving aeration and soil oxygen concentrations lei et al 2017 niu et al 2021 micro bubbles have unique characteristics large surface area longevity and the ability to deliver oxygen continuously to water niu et al 2021 studies have shown that adi promotes plant growth and productivity in tomatoes du et al 2020 cucumbers cui et al 2020 celery zhang et al 2021b and melons li et al 2020b in addition adi increases soil nutrients including soil total organic carbon total nitrogen total phosphorus and available soil nutrients alkali nitrogen available phosphorus available potassium as observed in many studies ben noah et al 2021 ouyang et al 2020 zhou et al 2019 however few studies have investigated the effect of adi on soil microbial communities microorganisms play a crucial role in regulating ecosystem function and soil biogeochemistry which are sensitive to variations in their surroundings including climate de vries et al 2018 shigyo et al 2019 agronomic nutrient supplements gao et al 2021 lekberg et al 2021 and irrigation practices baram et al 2021 microbial community diversity and composition are affected by oxygen content biggs weber et al 2020 for example oxygen content increases the relative abundance of aerobes and facultative anaerobes while inhibiting that of obligate anaerobes chen et al 2019 ye et al 2019 furthermore the dissolved oxygen gradient strongly influences the soil microbial community network muhammad et al 2021 the connectivity centrality and complexity of microbial network nodes significantly increased under high dissolved oxygen conditions suggesting a decline in the stability of the microbial network abbas et al 2019 biggs weber et al 2020 wu et al 2021 and zhang et al 2021d showed that reduced microbial community stability led to a positive feedback process of carbon and phosphorus to changes in environmental factors which may be associated with changes in microbial taxonomic composition however different microbial taxonomic species often interact forming a complex network liu et al 2021 complex microbial networks promote ecosystem multifunctionality related to nutrient cycling li et al 2021 thus adjusting the microhabitat oxygen content using adi should induce changes in the soil microbial community s taxonomic composition network and function with consequences for soil carbon and phosphorus bacteria and fungi account for about 90 of total soil microbial biomass and play important roles in nutrient cycling and mineralization beule et al 2019 muhammad et al 2021 as an important component of soil microorganisms bacteria are correlated with soc transformation processes while fungi are involved in decomposing mineral components such as soil phosphorus che et al 2019 kheirfam et al 2017 bacteria and fungi also contribute differently to nutrient turnover and energy flow through the soil food web influencing its rate and stability zheng et al 2018 bacteria and fungi play different roles in soil functions but are closely related and jointly dominate soil biogeochemical processes fan et al 2022 glass and rico ram√≠rez 2022 numerous studies have shown that the growth and reproduction of fungi in the soil ecosystem require different conditions to those required by bacteria and that fungi are more sensitive to environmental disturbances than bacteria fan et al 2022 lekberg et al 2021 shigyo et al 2019 adi increases soc and available phosphorus contents niu et al 2011 zhou et al 2020 but bacteria and fungi may respond differently to adi in the same oxygen environment therefore it is necessary to simultaneously investigate changes in bacterial and fungal communities to understand how adi application affects changes in soc and available phosphorus here we hypothesized that bacterial communities contribute more to soc than fungal communities while fungal communities increase available phosphorus under adi especially at moderate and high dissolved oxygen levels we used high throughput sequencing to investigate the response of bacterial communities fungal communities and soil nutrients to adi application in a two season adi field experiment in a warm temperate region specifically this study aimed to 1 determine the extent of bacterial and fungal community diversity taxonomic composition and network shifts with adi application 2 determine the possible mechanisms that explain the microbial function responses to adi application 3 assess the impact of bacterial and fungal communities on soil nutrient availability in conjunction with adi application 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and experimental design field experiments were conducted on the two season tomato variety oumanda in a solar greenhouse in shouguang shandong province northern china

july 2021 the field experiment was arranged as a split plot 8 5 m long by 1 6 m wide plastic film was used between the ridges to prevent lateral water leakage subsurface drip irrigation was used for irrigation before transplanting a subsurface drip irrigation belt 16 mm diameter 20 cm between drips was laid in the center of each cultivation area buried at 15 cm depth the water flow of the drips was 2 2 l h 1 tomato was planted in a wide narrow row pattern evenly spaced 80 cm and 40 cm agronomic management included irrigation fertilization pruning and old leaf removal there were three aerated adi treatments 10 15 and 20 mg l 1 dissolved oxygen referred to as a1 a2 and a3 the control treatment ck was irrigated exclusively with non aerated groundwater 5 mg l 1 dissolved oxygen there were three replicates per treatment each comprising one plot adi uses a venturi air jet to create a negative pressure in the pipe which mixes the water with oxygen the inlet oxygen volume in this study was about 15 of the total irrigation volume the venturi air jet is connected to the main pipeline it is turned on for adi to draw oxygen into the line to form a water oxygen mixture for irrigation and turned off for subsurface drip irrigation the irrigation amount is equivalent to the accumulative evaporation of a 20 mm diameter evaporation pan since the last irrigation flowmeters were installed in the head part of the irrigation system to control the amount of irrigation in each treatment the irrigation rate was 2350 m3 ha 1 during the growing period 2 2 soil sampling rhizosphere soils within 0 40 cm depth were taken during tomato harvest in july 2021 for spring cultivation 20 soil samples were collected five replicates per treatment following an s shaped pattern across each plot five soil

software principal coordinates analysis pcoa was performed using unweighted unifrac distances and pls da was used to analyze intergroup differences pcoa was performed using the scatterplot2d package in r 4 1 2 primer 7 was used to perform hierarchical clustering based on bray curtis dissimilarity the linear discriminant analysis lda effect size lefse method was used to evaluate bacterial and fungal taxa significantly associated with adi and ck soils the alpha value for the factorial kruskale wallis test was 0 05 and the threshold on the logarithmic lda score for the discriminative feature

using the ggcor package in r 4 1 2 the causal relationships between adi soil nutrients bacterial community fungal community and crop yield were assessed by structural equation modeling sem the value of œá2 and the root mean square error of approximation were used to determine the model s fit the sem was conducted in smartpls 3 results 3 1 diversity of soil bacterial and fungal communities the study retained 1728 620 raw sequences for 16 s rrna genes and 2633 480 raw sequences for its genes after quality filtering with 60 982 and 6833 asvs obtained based on 97 similarity the adi treatments did not significantly affect the diversity of bacterial communities chao1 ace and shannon indexes p 0 05 fig 1a compared to the ck treatment in contrast the a2 treatment had significantly greater fungal community diversity than ck p 0 01 fig 1b however no significant difference occurred between the a1 and a3 treatments the pcoa at the asv level revealed different bacterial and fungal communities among the four treatments fig 2 with the first axis explaining 30 29 and 33 24 of the variation in bacterial and fungal community composition respectively the adonis test separated the samples in the ck and adi treatments a1 a2 and a3 p 0 0001 indicating that adi significantly affected the bacterial and fungal communities which was validated by clustering bray curtis dissimilarities fig s1 for bacteria the a2 soil samples were distinct from ck a1 and a3 soil samples and in a separate cluster 3 2 distinct taxonomic profiles of bacterial and fungal communities the dominant bacterial phyla across the soil samples relative abundance 5 were proteobacteria actinobacteria firmicutes chloroflexi and planctomycetes with relative abundances ranging from 31 23 to 34 14 16 21 18 00 12 33 15 21 8 17 12 32 and 7 66 8 81 respectively fig 3a less abundant phyla relative abundance 0 1 but 5 but still detected across all samples were acidobacteria bacteroidetes gemmatimonadetes nitrospirae and candidate division wps 1 data not shown the adi treatments increased the relative abundance of firmicutes and gemmatimonadetes but decreased the relative abundance of proteobacteria and actinobacteria compared to ck the dominant fungal phyla relative abundance 5 across the soil samples were ascomycota and mortierellomycota with relative abundances ranging from 54 21 to 78 90 and 8 96 34 18 respectively accounting for 85 of the total relative abundance fig 3b the adi treatments significantly increased the relative abundance of mortierellomycota but decreased the relative abundance of ascomycota compared to ck the lefse analysis identified the specific taxa with consistently altered abundance in the adi treatments in total 141 taxa from phylum to genus were identified with lda scores 3 and p values 0 05 fig 4a the number of enriched bacteria was 52 for ck 22 for a1 59 for a2 and eight for a3 specifically the a1 treatment significantly increased the relative abundance of acidobacteria from phylum to class and nitrospirae from phylum to genus compared to ck while ck increased the relative abundance of candidate division wps 1 phylum compared to the a1 treatment the a2 treatment significantly enriched chloroflexi from phylum to family flavobacteriia from class to family anaerolineae from class to family litorilinea genus and cellulosimicrobium genus while the a3 treatment significantly enriched alphaproteobacteria order adhaeribacter genus and gimesia genus in addition the adi treatments increased the relative abundance of the genera rhodomicrobium and gimesia while ck increased the relative abundance of the genera solirubrobacter and families solirubrobacteraceae and xanthobacteraceae fig s2a for fungi the four treatments differentially enriched 92 taxa from phylum to genus the cladogram results showed eight enriched fungi for ck 11 for a1 40 for a2 and 33 for a3 fig 4b for example the ck a1 and a2 treatments significantly enriched ascomycota phylum mortierellomycota from phylum to genus and olpidiomycota from phylum to genus respectively while the a3 treatment significantly enriched basidiomycota phylum further analysis showed that the adi treatments had higher relative abundances of stachybotryaceae family gymnoascus genus chrysosporium genus humicola genus mycothermus genus and myceliophthora genus than ck in contrast ck had higher relative abundances of pezizomycetes class pezizales order and saccharomycetales family than the adi treatments fig s2b 3 3 co occurrence network analysis of bacterial and fungal communities based on the co occurrence scores bacterial networks were constructed to assess the relationship between soil bacterial communities and niche separation in the four treatments fig 5 table s1 all four treatments had similar sized networks 197 208 nodes table s1 the adi treatments had smaller clustering coefficients and graph density than ck the adi treatments a1 a2 a3 and ck harbored four five five and four modules with modularity values of 0 53 0 50 0 47 and 0 42 respectively modularity measures the degree to which the network is organized into clearly delimited modules networks with high modularity have more dense connections between nodes within the module but more sparse connections between nodes in different modules moreover the adi treatments had significantly higher positive negative p n link ratios than ck indicating that they had more positive co occurrence relationships than ck for fungi the adi treatments had higher values for nodes edges network diameter average path length and degree than ck but diminished interactions between nodes within fungal network modules the opposite of the bacterial network for example the strong interactions among fungal modularity values decreased from 0 75 in ck to 0 61 in the a1 treatment table s1 in addition the a1 and a2 treatments had much higher p n link ratios than ck in line with the community overview data the three most abundant nodes in the adi treatments asv 1 asv 2 and asv 3 belonged to mortierellomycota whereas the most abundant species in the ck treatment network asv 4 belonged to ascomycota 3 4 functional characteristics of bacterial and fungal communities based on bacterial asvs faprotax analysis was used to predict ecological and biological functions fig 6a sixty categories were linked to the soil bacterial community with the dominant functional groups classified as chemoheterotrophy 12 5 aerobic chemoheterotrophy 20 07 aerobic chemoheterotrophy 18 32 nitrate reduction 1 61 ureolysis 1 44 aromatic compound degradation 1 37 and nitrification 1 20 the top 30 predicted functions of bacterial communities are shown in fig 6a functional clustering divided the top 30 functions into four parts generally adi produced more abundant groups capable of ureolysis than ck with fewer groups capable of denitrification nitrite respiration and nitrate reduction specifically the a1 treatment significantly increased the relative abundance of groups capable of nitrification and aerobic ammonia oxidation the a2 treatment had the highest relative abundance of fermentation and cellulolysis functional groups while the a3 treatment had a higher relative abundance of groups capable of phototrophy photoheterotrophy anoxygenic photoautotrophy and photoautotrophy than the other treatments the funguild database was used to predict fungal function in the different aeration treatments to understand the effect of adi on soil fungal community function the fungi were classified into three types based on ecological function fig 6b endophyte saprotroph and pathotroph endophyte litte dung saprotroph undefined saprotroph and endophyte were the main functional groups making up 42 95 of the total compared with ck the adi treatments had a higher relative abundance of dung saprotroph plant saprotroph dung saprotroph undefined saprotroph and dung saprotroph soil saprotroph wood saprotroph functional groups and lower relative abundance of plant pathogen functional groups in contrast the relative abundance of endophyte did not significantly differ between the adi and ck treatments notably the adi treatments significantly increased the proportion of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi amf functional group 3 5 environmental factors driving shifts in bacterial and fungal communities the adi treatments significantly altered soil chemical properties compared with ck the adi treatments especially a2 significantly increased soc ap tn and nh4 n contents p 0 05 but did not significantly affect no3 n content p 0 05 table s2 the redundancy analysis showed that the soil microbial bacterial and fungal taxa responded differently to environmental factors fig 7a b notably soc and ap had the greatest effect on soil bacterial and fungal taxa fig 7c d in particular soc had the greatest effect on bacterial community composition positively correlating with changes in ignavibacteriae and gemmatimonades fig 7a c in contrast ap had the greatest effect on fungal community composition followed by soc and ph these selected factors were highly related to changes in mortierellomycota ascomycota basidiomycota and calcarisporiellomycota fig 7b d using the mantel test we evaluated the effect of each environmental factor on soil bacterial and fungal network structures fig 8a ap r 0 901 p 0 04 significantly impacted soil fungal network structure but the associations between bacterial network structure and environmental factors were not significant p 0 05 the mantel test also revealed correlations between environmental factors and community diversities fig 8b soil bacterial community diversity positively correlated with ph r 0 880 p 0 048 but negatively correlated with soc r 0 931 p 0 022 and nh4 n r 0 923 p 0 025 fungal community diversity positively correlated with soc r 0 971 p 0 005 tn r 0 958 p 0 010 nh4 n r 0 975 p 0 004 ak r 0 916 p 0 028 and ph r 0 988 p 0 001 fig 8b the adi treatments produced significantly higher tomato yields than ck table s2 p 0 05 the a2 treatment had the highest tomato yield 106 52 t ha 1 27 73 10 87 and 10 16 higher than ck a1 and a3 respectively p 0 05 the sem fit the data well œá2 0 964 p 0 551 sgfi 0 734 smsea 0 000 explaining 50 8 of the variation in the bacterial community 30 6 of the variation in the fungal community 54 5 of the variation in soc 54 6 of the variation in ap and 70 of the variation in crop yield fig 9 the adi treatments directly affected the bacterial Œª 0 52 p 0 05 and fungal Œª 0 73 p 0 01 communities the bacterial community directly affected crop yield by changing soc Œª 0 83 p 0 001 furthermore the fungal community had a direct positive effect on the bacterial community Œª 1 16 p 0 001 and ap Œª 0 64 p 0 001 while ap had a direct positive effect on crop yield 4 discussion adi is an important agricultural irrigation measure for current and future agricultural development du et al 2020 pendergast et al 2019 studies have shown that adi improves soil fertility and increases crop yields ben noah et al 2021 ouyang et al 2020 in particular adi significantly increases soc and ap contents niu et al 2011 zhou et al 2020 analyses of bacterial and fungal diversity taxonomic composition co occurrence network and microbial function help us understand adi s effect on the soil microbial community 4 1 bacterial communities contributed more to soc and fungal communities contributed more to ap under adi the soil oxygen concentration affects the phylogenetic and physiological composition of microbial communities baram et al 2021 glass and rico ram√≠rez 2022 accumulating evidence suggests that soil disturbance by agricultural practices such as straw returning muhammad et al 2021 conservation tillage zhang et al 2018 biochar zhang et al 2022 and organic fertilizer additions liu et al 2021 increases soil aeration and oxygen concentrations altering soil bacterial and fungal community composition thus adi will likely affect the rhizosphere s bacterial and fungal community composition due to a shift in oxygen concentration the adi soil had a greater abundance of the bacterial phyla gemmatimonadetes and firmicutes than the ck soil gemmatimonadetes members exhibit a robust photosynthetic fuel capacity to oxidize organic and inorganic compounds fu et al 2022 firmicutes are typical copiotrophic bacteria that can convert cellulose and hemicellulose into smaller polysaccharides li et al 2020a increased abundance of gemmatimonadetes and firmicutes induced old and recalcitrant carbon decomposition in peatlands with aerobic environments krause et al 2020 tian et al 2022 these phyla may play a similar role in the breakdown of soil old and recalcitrant carbon under adi furthermore the lefse method identified microbial groups associated with the soil carbon cycle with the a2 treatment significantly enriching aerobes and facultative anaerobes chloroflexi flavobacteriia anaerolineae litorilinea and cellulosimicrobium biggs weber et al 2020 and cao et al 2021 demonstrated that aerobic groups provide energy for life by absorbing organic macromolecules of oxidized sugars moreover the aerobic groups use light energy or oxidize inorganic compounds to generate chemical energy to fix inorganic carbon in the environment zhang et al 2021c zhou et al 2022 in support the a2 treatments significantly increased soc table s2 the sem results also showed that bacterial community changes had a direct positive effect on soc content we further speculated that the a2 treatment significantly increased the content of dissolved organic carbon microbial biomass carbon easily oxidizable carbon and particulate organic carbon poc p 0 05 relative to ck other studies have found that aerobes effectively promote the transformation of soil carbon pool from a stable to unstable state under well aerated conditions fu et al 2022 minamikawa and makino 2020 tian et al 2022 conducive to facilitating the synthesis of unsteady carbon components and increasing the effectiveness of the soil carbon pool fungal composition varied between the adi and ck treatments mortierellomycota was the most abundant fungal phylum identified in the adi treatment in line with a previous study on ridge cultivated strawberries good soil air permeability on ridges and positively affected ap content mu√±oz et al 2017 indeed mortierellomycota promotes phytohormone production e g gibberellins indoleacetic acid provides symbiotic plants with nutrients such as phosphorus gaiero et al 2021 and releases various organic acids that dissolve recalcitrant inorganic phosphorus forms zhang et al 2020 conversely members of the phylum ascomycota strongly dominated the soil fungal community in the ck treatment a somewhat surprising result as this phylum has many stress resistance related genes in agricultural soils we speculate that the dominant ascomycota species play an active role in resisting the hypoxic environment since subsurface drip irrigation would easily result in a hypoxic environment in the plant rhizosphere biggs weber et al 2020 zhou et al 2022 for instance ascomycota species may gain a competitive advantage via competition for niche space and resources against hypoxic environments biggs weber et al 2020 li et al 2020b additionally many surveys have indicated that aerobic conditions activate aerobic fungi such as stachybotryaceae gymnoascus chrysosporium humicola mycothermus and myceliophthora abbas et al 2019 baram et al 2021 the adi treatments enriched humicola mycothermus and myceliophthora which can solubilize phosphate xiao et al 2020 ma≈°kov√° et al 2021 demonstrated that phosphorus dissolving fungi could dissolve and convert ineffective phosphorus into available phosphorus for plant use lending support to the finding that the adi treatments significantly increased ap table s2 a critical driver of soil fungal community composition fig 7b however it was noteworthy that the a3 treatment significantly enriched basidiomycota as pathogenic fungi many basidiomycetes and limespora are susceptible to plant diseases such as root nematodes root rot and gray mold in high oxygen environments chen et al 2019 kr√ºger et al 2017 therefore it is crucial to control rhizosphere oxygen concentrations for healthy plant development 4 2 adi influenced microbial co occurrence network and diversity the microbial molecular ecological networks revealed distinct patterns within the soil microbial communities unsurprisingly ascomycota held a dominant position in the ck treatment while the beneficial microbe mortierellomycota had a dominant position in the adi treatments generally dominant members play a substantial role in regulating network ecosystem functional processes li et al 2021 ro≈ºek et al 2019 for example most mortierellomycota species are associated with soil phosphorus cycling gao et al 2021 hao et al 2020 however future studies are needed to determine the specific contribution of these species in promoting soil phosphorus cycling the adi treatments had lower fungal group modularity than ck indicating that the fungal members were less resistant to changes in environmental factors bello et al 2021 de vries et al 2018 in the present study the mantel test results showed a significant correlation between soil ap and fungal networks indicating that adi fungal communities were more sensitive to environmental changes than ck fungal communities additionally the adi fungal networks had higher average path lengths and network diameters than the ck fungal networks indicating stronger interactions between network modules enabling fungal species to respond synchronously to environmental changes in the soil bahram et al 2018 price et al 2021 for instance adi improved plant rhizosphere aeration and soil oxygen content positively affecting the abundance of aerobic fungal species and thus increasing fungal community diversity tian et al 2022 interestingly the adi treatments altered fungal community diversity but not bacterial community diversity microbial diversity may correlate with the complexity of the network che et al 2019 zhang et al 2021a specifically the bacterial network had 197 208 nodes and 1216 1910 edges while the fungal network had 51 74 nodes and 86 151 edges indicating that the bacterial community had a more complex network than the fungal community and thus maintained a more robust structure de vries et al 2018 jiao et al 2022 the aggregation of modules and networks plays an important role in maintaining microbial network stability bello et al 2021 li et al 2021 the lower clustering coefficient value and higher modularity value of the adi networks indicate high covariance within modules with only a few links outside modules and these networks stabilize by limiting external perturbation to modules li et al 2021 stable networks enhance the ability of bacterial networks to withstand environmental disturbances de vries et al 2018 zhang et al 2021d therefore changes in bacterial community diversity associated with complex and stable networks were not noticeable furthermore microbial networks had positive and negative correlations suggesting cooperation and competition among microbial taxa price et al 2021 zheng et al 2018 in concordance with most studies cooperation with a high positive correlation edge was dominant in the ecological networks the adi bacterial taxa had more positive co occurrence relationships than the ck bacterial taxa implying increased cooperation suleiman et al 2019 other studies have shown that straw addition increased the positive correlation between bacterial taxa with predominantly positive covariations among rhizosphere bacteria where nutrients were usually abundant awasthi et al 2018 senbayram et al 2018 more importantly an increase in the cooperation among bacterial taxa in the ecological network is favorable for increasing the turnover rate of soil carbon muhammad et al 2021 similarly our study indicated that the increased soil oxygen content under adi enhanced cooperation and favored an increased soc content 4 3 adi significantly influenced microbial functionality soil microbial population function is based on phylogeny liu et al 2021 shifts in community composition and diversity adi vs ck were related to soil functional changes particularly the carbon cycle in terrestrial ecosystems increasing soc improves soil quality promoting plant growth chen et al 2019 veloso et al 2020 the aerobic environment associated with the adi treatments proliferated bacterial groups involved in carbon cycling and promoted soc accumulation which may contribute to increasing crop yield indeed soc had a direct positive effect on crop yield bello et al 2021 li et al 2021 moreover the mid level adi treatment a2 suppressed some groups capable of fermentation and cellulolysis cellulolysis groups are the most abundant nitrogen free soil organic matter enhancing the breakdown of stable humus to release nutrients abbas et al 2019 zhou et al 2020 the adi treatments enhanced the proliferation of microorganisms with the potential for carbon sequestration these results could explain the greater soc availability in the a2 treatment however given that the funguild analysis only provides a predictive functional map of the bacterial community further metagenomic analysis is required to assess the impact of adi on soil the funguild results showed that the adi treatment significantly increased the relative abundance of saprotroph groups a saprophyte obtains nutrients from dead host cells and participates in decomposing organic matter bello et al 2021 phosphorus cycling attarzadeh et al 2019 nutrient mobilization lekberg et al 2021 and soil structure formation beule et al 2019 in contrast pathotrophs obtain nutrition by damaging host cells attacking crops and controlling nematodes insects and other animal plant or fungal pest populations bahram et al 2018 lekberg et al 2021 in this study the ck treatment enriched pathotrophs while the adi treatment significantly increased the abundance of amf not detected in ck kr√ºger et al 2017 and ro≈ºek et al 2019 reported that aerobic environments enhanced amf growth compared to hypoxic environments increasing phosphorus availability and abiotic stress tolerance suppressing pathogen infection and promoting crop yields benitez et al 2016 found that amf stimulation in an aerobic environment improved soil fertility and crop yield because amf are common probiotics hao et al 2020 wang et al 2021 the extracorporeal hyphae of amf increase the ability of plants to absorb minerals and water hao et al 2021 veloso et al 2020 plant rhizospheres have functional fungal communities with different vegetative patterns and their interactions and associations play a key role in ecosystem services egidi et al 2019 thus it will be necessary to study the effects of adi on rhizosphere fungal community function and agricultural ecosystem stability in the future 5 conclusion this study showed that adi produced distinct patterns of soil bacterial and fungal communities increasing fungal community diversity but not affecting bacterial community diversity adi significantly changed bacterial and fungal co occurrence relationships improving the stability of bacterial networks and increasing the susceptibility of fungal communities to soil ap we propose that bacterial communities play an important role in improving soc content while fungal communities facilitate ap content the bacterial phyla gemmatimonades and firmicutes the fungal phylum mortierellomycota and a few taxa were key players in improving soc and ap in the adi treatments respectively adi at mid level dissolved oxygen concentrations increased the relative abundance of carbon and phosphorus related functional groups further studies are needed to identify the response of functional microbial communities to adi in different nutrient patterns which may open new avenues for developing rational irrigation

9225,soil bacteria and fungi play key roles in organic matter decomposition and nutrient turnover aerated drip irrigation adi is beneficial for improving soil nutrients but its effects on bacterial and fungal communities are less known in this study a two season adi field experiment comprising three dissolved oxygen concentrations 10 15 and 20 mg l 1 referred to as a1 a2 and a3 and a control treatment groundwater without aerated ck was conducted in a tomato plantation in shandong china soil bacterial and fungal communities were examined using high throughput sequencing targeting 16 s rrna and its genes respectively the adi treatments increased fungal community diversity but did not significantly affect bacterial community diversity however bacterial communities were more connected within the module with more stable network structures in the adi treatments in contrast fungal networks had lower modularity values and a significant negative correlation with soil available phosphorus ap the adi treatments increased the bacterial phylum gemmatimonadetes and firmicutes and a few aerobic taxa and strongly enriched the fungal phylum mortierellomycota and phosphorus dissolving taxa humicola mycothermus and myceliophthora in addition the a2 treatment enhanced functional groups related to carbon and phosphorus cycling while decreasing plant pathogen functional groups the most important environmental factors affecting bacterial and fungal communities were soil organic carbon soc and ap respectively structural equation modeling sem demonstrated that adi directly affected soil bacterial and fungal communities and indirectly promoted soc ap content and tomato yield overall our findings highlight the importance of bacterial and fungal taxonomic communities co occurrence networks and functions related to regulating soil carbon and phosphorus availability providing novel evidence for the application of adi to improve soil fertility and crop productivity graphical abstract ga1 keywords aerated drip irrigation soil bacteria and fungi taxonomic composition co occurrence networks functions soil carbon and phosphorus availability data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction intensive agricultural production has degraded soils decreasing soil productivity in many parts of the world kheirfam et al 2017 lekberg et al 2021 including fluvo aquic soils in northern china tomato a cash crop is widely grown in temperate and subtropical regions however tomato cropping systems are susceptible to rhizosphere hypoxia stress due to intensive tillage short crop rotations and mechanical compaction practices that reduce soil quality and crop productivity in the long term du et al 2020 jiang et al 2019 increased aeration in the rhizosphere can improve soil fertility baram et al 2021 aerated drip irrigation adi is a technique that uses micro bubbles to deliver oxygen enhanced water to the root zones of plants improving aeration and soil oxygen concentrations lei et al 2017 niu et al 2021 micro bubbles have unique characteristics large surface area longevity and the ability to deliver oxygen continuously to water niu et al 2021 studies have shown that adi promotes plant growth and productivity in tomatoes du et al 2020 cucumbers cui et al 2020 celery zhang et al 2021b and melons li et al 2020b in addition adi increases soil nutrients including soil total organic carbon total nitrogen total phosphorus and available soil nutrients alkali nitrogen available phosphorus available potassium as observed in many studies ben noah et al 2021 ouyang et al 2020 zhou et al 2019 however few studies have investigated the effect of adi on soil microbial communities microorganisms play a crucial role in regulating ecosystem function and soil biogeochemistry which are sensitive to variations in their surroundings including climate de vries et al 2018 shigyo et al 2019 agronomic nutrient supplements gao et al 2021 lekberg et al 2021 and irrigation practices baram et al 2021 microbial community diversity and composition are affected by oxygen content biggs weber et al 2020 for example oxygen content increases the relative abundance of aerobes and facultative anaerobes while inhibiting that of obligate anaerobes chen et al 2019 ye et al 2019 furthermore the dissolved oxygen gradient strongly influences the soil microbial community network muhammad et al 2021 the connectivity centrality and complexity of microbial network nodes significantly increased under high dissolved oxygen conditions suggesting a decline in the stability of the microbial network abbas et al 2019 biggs weber et al 2020 wu et al 2021 and zhang et al 2021d showed that reduced microbial community stability led to a positive feedback process of carbon and phosphorus to changes in environmental factors which may be associated with changes in microbial taxonomic composition however different microbial taxonomic species often interact forming a complex network liu et al 2021 complex microbial networks promote ecosystem multifunctionality related to nutrient cycling li et al 2021 thus adjusting the microhabitat oxygen content using adi should induce changes in the soil microbial community s taxonomic composition network and function with consequences for soil carbon and phosphorus bacteria and fungi account for about 90 of total soil microbial biomass and play important roles in nutrient cycling and mineralization beule et al 2019 muhammad et al 2021 as an important component of soil microorganisms bacteria are correlated with soc transformation processes while fungi are involved in decomposing mineral components such as soil phosphorus che et al 2019 kheirfam et al 2017 bacteria and fungi also contribute differently to nutrient turnover and energy flow through the soil food web influencing its rate and stability zheng et al 2018 bacteria and fungi play different roles in soil functions but are closely related and jointly dominate soil biogeochemical processes fan et al 2022 glass and rico ram√≠rez 2022 numerous studies have shown that the growth and reproduction of fungi in the soil ecosystem require different conditions to those required by bacteria and that fungi are more sensitive to environmental disturbances than bacteria fan et al 2022 lekberg et al 2021 shigyo et al 2019 adi increases soc and available phosphorus contents niu et al 2011 zhou et al 2020 but bacteria and fungi may respond differently to adi in the same oxygen environment therefore it is necessary to simultaneously investigate changes in bacterial and fungal communities to understand how adi application affects changes in soc and available phosphorus here we hypothesized that bacterial communities contribute more to soc than fungal communities while fungal communities increase available phosphorus under adi especially at moderate and high dissolved oxygen levels we used high throughput sequencing to investigate the response of bacterial communities fungal communities and soil nutrients to adi application in a two season adi field experiment in a warm temperate region specifically this study aimed to 1 determine the extent of bacterial and fungal community diversity taxonomic composition and network shifts with adi application 2 determine the possible mechanisms that explain the microbial function responses to adi application 3 assess the impact of bacterial and fungal communities on soil nutrient availability in conjunction with adi application 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and experimental design field experiments were conducted on the two season tomato variety oumanda in a solar greenhouse in shouguang shandong province northern china

july 2021 the field experiment was arranged as a split plot 8 5 m long by 1 6 m wide plastic film was used between the ridges to prevent lateral water leakage subsurface drip irrigation was used for irrigation before transplanting a subsurface drip irrigation belt 16 mm diameter 20 cm between drips was laid in the center of each cultivation area buried at 15 cm depth the water flow of the drips was 2 2 l h 1 tomato was planted in a wide narrow row pattern evenly spaced 80 cm and 40 cm agronomic management included irrigation fertilization pruning and old leaf removal there were three aerated adi treatments 10 15 and 20 mg l 1 dissolved oxygen referred to as a1 a2 and a3 the control treatment ck was irrigated exclusively with non aerated groundwater 5 mg l 1 dissolved oxygen there were three replicates per treatment each comprising one plot adi uses a venturi air jet to create a negative pressure in the pipe which mixes the water with oxygen the inlet oxygen volume in this study was about 15 of the total irrigation volume the venturi air jet is connected to the main pipeline it is turned on for adi to draw oxygen into the line to form a water oxygen mixture for irrigation and turned off for subsurface drip irrigation the irrigation amount is equivalent to the accumulative evaporation of a 20 mm diameter evaporation pan since the last irrigation flowmeters were installed in the head part of the irrigation system to control the amount of irrigation in each treatment the irrigation rate was 2350 m3 ha 1 during the growing period 2 2 soil sampling rhizosphere soils within 0 40 cm depth were taken during tomato harvest in july 2021 for spring cultivation 20 soil samples were collected five replicates per treatment following an s shaped pattern across each plot five soil

software principal coordinates analysis pcoa was performed using unweighted unifrac distances and pls da was used to analyze intergroup differences pcoa was performed using the scatterplot2d package in r 4 1 2 primer 7 was used to perform hierarchical clustering based on bray curtis dissimilarity the linear discriminant analysis lda effect size lefse method was used to evaluate bacterial and fungal taxa significantly associated with adi and ck soils the alpha value for the factorial kruskale wallis test was 0 05 and the threshold on the logarithmic lda score for the discriminative feature

study retained 1728 620 raw sequences for 16 s rrna genes and 2633 480 raw sequences for its genes after quality filtering with 60 982 and 6833 asvs obtained based on 97 similarity the adi treatments did not significantly affect the diversity of bacterial communities chao1 ace and shannon indexes p 0 05 fig 1a compared to the ck treatment in contrast the a2 treatment had significantly greater fungal community diversity than ck p 0 01 fig 1b however no significant difference occurred between the a1 and a3 treatments the pcoa at the asv level revealed different bacterial and fungal communities among the four treatments fig 2 with the first axis explaining 30 29 and 33 24 of the variation in bacterial and fungal community composition respectively the adonis test separated the samples in the ck and adi treatments a1 a2 and a3 p 0 0001 indicating that adi significantly affected the bacterial and fungal communities which was validated by clustering bray curtis dissimilarities fig s1 for bacteria the a2 soil samples were distinct from ck a1 and a3 soil samples and in a separate cluster 3 2 distinct taxonomic profiles of bacterial and fungal communities the dominant bacterial phyla across the soil samples relative abundance 5 were proteobacteria actinobacteria firmicutes chloroflexi and planctomycetes with relative abundances ranging from 31 23 to 34 14 16 21 18 00 12 33 15 21 8 17 12 32 and 7 66 8 81 respectively fig 3a less abundant phyla relative abundance 0 1 but 5 but still detected across all samples were acidobacteria bacteroidetes gemmatimonadetes nitrospirae and candidate division wps 1 data not shown the adi treatments increased the relative abundance of firmicutes and gemmatimonadetes but decreased the relative abundance of proteobacteria and actinobacteria compared to ck the dominant fungal phyla relative abundance 5 across the soil samples were ascomycota and mortierellomycota with relative abundances ranging from 54 21 to 78 90 and 8 96 34 18 respectively accounting for 85 of the total relative abundance fig 3b the adi treatments significantly increased the relative abundance of mortierellomycota but decreased the relative abundance of ascomycota compared to ck the lefse analysis identified the specific taxa with consistently altered abundance in the adi treatments in total 141 taxa from phylum to genus were identified with lda scores 3 and p values 0 05 fig 4a the number of enriched bacteria was 52 for ck 22 for a1 59 for a2 and eight for a3 specifically the a1 treatment significantly increased the relative abundance of acidobacteria from phylum to class and nitrospirae from phylum to genus compared to ck while ck increased the relative abundance of candidate division wps 1 phylum compared to the a1 treatment the a2 treatment significantly enriched chloroflexi from phylum to family flavobacteriia from class to family anaerolineae from class to family litorilinea genus and cellulosimicrobium genus while the a3 treatment significantly enriched alphaproteobacteria order adhaeribacter genus and gimesia genus in addition the adi treatments increased the relative abundance of the genera rhodomicrobium and gimesia while ck increased the relative abundance of the genera solirubrobacter and families solirubrobacteraceae and xanthobacteraceae fig s2a for fungi the four treatments differentially enriched 92 taxa from phylum to genus the cladogram results showed eight enriched fungi for ck 11 for a1 40 for a2 and 33 for a3 fig 4b for example the ck a1 and a2 treatments significantly enriched ascomycota phylum mortierellomycota from phylum to genus and olpidiomycota from phylum to genus respectively while the a3 treatment significantly enriched basidiomycota phylum further analysis showed that the adi treatments had higher relative abundances of stachybotryaceae family gymnoascus genus chrysosporium genus humicola genus mycothermus genus and myceliophthora genus than ck in contrast ck had higher relative abundances of pezizomycetes class pezizales order and saccharomycetales family than the adi treatments fig s2b 3 3 co occurrence network analysis of bacterial and fungal communities based on the co occurrence scores bacterial networks were constructed to assess the relationship between soil bacterial communities and niche separation in the four treatments fig 5 table s1 all four treatments had similar sized networks 197 208 nodes table s1 the adi treatments had smaller clustering coefficients and graph density than ck the adi treatments a1 a2 a3 and ck harbored four five five and four modules with modularity values of 0 53 0 50 0 47 and 0 42 respectively modularity measures the degree to which the network is organized into clearly delimited modules networks with high modularity have more dense connections between nodes within the module but more sparse connections between nodes in different modules moreover the adi treatments had significantly higher positive negative p n link ratios than ck indicating that they had more positive co occurrence relationships than ck for fungi the adi treatments had higher values for nodes edges network diameter average path length and degree than ck but diminished interactions between nodes within fungal network modules the opposite of the bacterial network for example the strong interactions among fungal modularity values decreased from 0 75 in ck to 0 61 in the a1 treatment table s1 in addition the a1 and a2 treatments had much higher p n link ratios than ck in line with the community overview data the three most abundant nodes in the adi treatments asv 1 asv 2 and asv 3 belonged to mortierellomycota whereas the most abundant species in the ck treatment network asv 4 belonged to ascomycota 3 4 functional characteristics of bacterial and fungal communities based on bacterial asvs faprotax analysis was used to predict ecological and biological functions fig 6a sixty categories were linked to the soil bacterial community with the dominant functional groups classified as chemoheterotrophy 12 5 aerobic chemoheterotrophy 20 07 aerobic chemoheterotrophy 18 32 nitrate reduction 1 61 ureolysis 1 44 aromatic compound degradation 1 37 and nitrification 1 20 the top 30 predicted functions of bacterial communities are shown in fig 6a functional clustering divided the top 30 functions into four parts generally adi produced more abundant groups capable of ureolysis than ck with fewer groups capable of denitrification nitrite respiration and nitrate reduction specifically the a1 treatment significantly increased the relative abundance of groups capable of nitrification and aerobic ammonia oxidation the a2 treatment had the highest relative abundance of fermentation and cellulolysis functional groups while the a3 treatment had a higher relative abundance of groups capable of phototrophy photoheterotrophy anoxygenic photoautotrophy and photoautotrophy than the other treatments the funguild database was used to predict fungal function in the different aeration treatments to understand the effect of adi on soil fungal community function the fungi were classified into three types based on ecological function fig 6b endophyte saprotroph and pathotroph endophyte litte dung saprotroph undefined saprotroph and endophyte were the main functional groups making up 42 95 of the total compared with ck the adi treatments had a higher relative abundance of dung saprotroph plant saprotroph dung saprotroph undefined saprotroph and dung saprotroph soil saprotroph wood saprotroph functional groups and lower relative abundance of plant pathogen functional groups in contrast the relative abundance of endophyte did not significantly differ between the adi and ck treatments notably the adi treatments significantly increased the proportion of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi amf functional group 3 5 environmental factors driving shifts in bacterial and fungal communities the adi treatments significantly altered soil chemical properties compared with ck the adi treatments especially a2 significantly increased soc ap tn and nh4 n contents p 0 05 but did not significantly affect no3 n content p 0 05 table s2 the redundancy analysis showed that the soil microbial bacterial and fungal taxa responded differently to environmental factors fig 7a b notably soc and ap had the greatest effect on soil bacterial and fungal taxa fig 7c d in particular soc had the greatest effect on bacterial community composition positively correlating with changes in ignavibacteriae and gemmatimonades fig 7a c in contrast ap had the greatest effect on fungal community composition followed by soc and ph these selected factors were highly related to changes in mortierellomycota ascomycota basidiomycota and calcarisporiellomycota fig 7b d using the mantel test we evaluated the effect of each environmental factor on soil bacterial and fungal network structures fig 8a ap r 0 901 p 0 04 significantly impacted soil fungal network structure but the associations between bacterial network structure and environmental factors were not significant p 0 05 the mantel test also revealed correlations between environmental factors and community diversities fig 8b soil bacterial community diversity positively correlated with ph r 0 880 p 0 048 but negatively correlated with soc r 0 931 p 0 022 and nh4 n r 0 923 p 0 025 fungal community diversity positively correlated with soc r 0 971 p 0 005 tn r 0 958 p 0 010 nh4 n r 0 975 p 0 004 ak r 0 916 p 0 028 and ph r 0 988 p 0 001 fig 8b the adi treatments produced significantly higher tomato yields than ck table s2 p 0 05 the a2 treatment had the highest tomato yield 106 52 t ha 1 27 73 10 87 and 10 16 higher than ck a1 and a3 respectively p 0 05 the sem fit the data well œá2 0 964 p 0 551 sgfi 0 734 smsea 0 000 explaining 50 8 of the variation in the bacterial community 30 6 of the variation in the fungal community 54 5 of the variation in soc 54 6 of the variation in ap and 70 of the variation in crop yield fig 9 the adi treatments directly affected the bacterial Œª 0 52 p 0 05 and fungal Œª 0 73 p 0 01 communities the bacterial community directly affected crop yield by changing soc Œª 0 83 p 0 001 furthermore the fungal community had a direct positive effect on the bacterial community Œª 1 16 p 0 001 and ap Œª 0 64 p 0 001 while ap had a direct positive effect on crop yield 4 discussion adi is an important agricultural irrigation measure for current and future agricultural development du et al 2020 pendergast et al 2019 studies have shown that adi improves soil fertility and increases crop yields ben noah et al 2021 ouyang et al 2020 in particular adi significantly increases soc and ap contents niu et al 2011 zhou et al 2020 analyses of bacterial and fungal diversity taxonomic composition co occurrence network and microbial function help us understand adi s effect on the soil microbial community 4 1 bacterial communities contributed more to soc and fungal communities contributed more to ap under adi the soil oxygen concentration affects the phylogenetic and physiological composition of microbial communities baram et al 2021 glass and rico ram√≠rez 2022 accumulating evidence suggests that soil disturbance by agricultural practices such as straw returning muhammad et al 2021 conservation tillage zhang et al 2018 biochar zhang et al 2022 and organic fertilizer additions liu et al 2021 increases soil aeration and oxygen concentrations altering soil bacterial and fungal community composition thus adi will likely affect the rhizosphere s bacterial and fungal community composition due to a shift in oxygen concentration the adi soil had a greater abundance of the bacterial phyla gemmatimonadetes and firmicutes than the ck soil gemmatimonadetes members exhibit a robust photosynthetic fuel capacity to oxidize organic and inorganic compounds fu et al 2022 firmicutes are typical copiotrophic bacteria that can convert cellulose and hemicellulose into smaller polysaccharides li et al 2020a increased abundance of gemmatimonadetes and firmicutes induced old and recalcitrant carbon decomposition in peatlands with aerobic environments krause et al 2020 tian et al 2022 these phyla may play a similar role in the breakdown of soil old and recalcitrant carbon under adi furthermore the lefse method identified microbial groups associated with the soil carbon cycle with the a2 treatment significantly enriching aerobes and facultative anaerobes chloroflexi flavobacteriia anaerolineae litorilinea and cellulosimicrobium biggs weber et al 2020 and cao et al 2021 demonstrated that aerobic groups provide energy for life by absorbing organic macromolecules of oxidized sugars moreover the aerobic groups use light energy or oxidize inorganic compounds to generate chemical energy to fix inorganic carbon in the environment zhang et al 2021c zhou et al 2022 in support the a2 treatments significantly increased soc table s2 the sem results also showed that bacterial community changes had a direct positive effect on soc content we further speculated that the a2 treatment significantly increased the content of dissolved organic carbon microbial biomass carbon easily oxidizable carbon and particulate organic carbon poc p 0 05 relative to ck other studies have found that aerobes effectively promote the transformation of soil carbon pool from a stable to unstable state under well aerated conditions fu et al 2022 minamikawa and makino 2020 tian et al 2022 conducive to facilitating the synthesis of unsteady carbon components and increasing the effectiveness of the soil carbon pool fungal composition varied between the adi and ck treatments mortierellomycota was the most abundant fungal phylum identified in the adi treatment in line with a previous study on ridge cultivated strawberries good soil air permeability on ridges and positively affected ap content mu√±oz et al 2017 indeed mortierellomycota promotes phytohormone production e g gibberellins indoleacetic acid provides symbiotic plants with nutrients such as phosphorus gaiero et al 2021 and releases various organic acids that dissolve recalcitrant inorganic phosphorus forms zhang et al 2020 conversely members of the phylum ascomycota strongly dominated the soil fungal community in the ck treatment a somewhat surprising result as this phylum has many stress resistance related genes in agricultural soils we speculate that the dominant ascomycota species play an active role in resisting the hypoxic environment since subsurface drip irrigation would easily result in a hypoxic environment in the plant rhizosphere biggs weber et al 2020 zhou et al 2022 for instance ascomycota species may gain a competitive advantage via competition for niche space and resources against hypoxic environments biggs weber et al 2020 li et al 2020b additionally many surveys have indicated that aerobic conditions activate aerobic fungi such as stachybotryaceae gymnoascus chrysosporium humicola mycothermus and myceliophthora abbas et al 2019 baram et al 2021 the adi treatments enriched humicola mycothermus and myceliophthora which can solubilize phosphate xiao et al 2020 ma≈°kov√° et al 2021 demonstrated that phosphorus dissolving fungi could dissolve and convert ineffective phosphorus into available phosphorus for plant use lending support to the finding that the adi treatments significantly increased ap table s2 a critical driver of soil fungal community composition fig 7b however it was noteworthy that the a3 treatment significantly enriched basidiomycota as pathogenic fungi many basidiomycetes and limespora are susceptible to plant diseases such as root nematodes root rot and gray mold in high oxygen environments chen et al 2019 kr√ºger et al 2017 therefore it is crucial to control rhizosphere oxygen concentrations for healthy plant development 4 2 adi influenced microbial co occurrence network and diversity the microbial molecular ecological networks revealed distinct patterns within the soil microbial communities unsurprisingly ascomycota held a dominant position in the ck treatment while the beneficial microbe mortierellomycota had a dominant position in the adi treatments generally dominant members play a substantial role in regulating network ecosystem functional processes li et al 2021 ro≈ºek et al 2019 for example most mortierellomycota species are associated with soil phosphorus cycling gao et al 2021 hao et al 2020 however future studies are needed to determine the specific contribution of these species in promoting soil phosphorus cycling the adi treatments had lower fungal group modularity than ck indicating that the fungal members were less resistant to changes in environmental factors bello et al 2021 de vries et al 2018 in the present study the mantel test results showed a significant correlation between soil ap and fungal networks indicating that adi fungal communities were more sensitive to environmental changes than ck fungal communities additionally the adi fungal networks had higher average path lengths and network diameters than the ck fungal networks indicating stronger interactions between network modules enabling fungal species to respond synchronously to environmental changes in the soil bahram et al 2018 price et al 2021 for instance adi improved plant rhizosphere aeration and soil oxygen content positively affecting the abundance of aerobic fungal species and thus increasing fungal community diversity tian et al 2022 interestingly the adi treatments altered fungal community diversity but not bacterial community diversity microbial diversity may correlate with the complexity of the network che et al 2019 zhang et al 2021a specifically the bacterial network had 197 208 nodes and 1216 1910 edges while the fungal network had 51 74 nodes and 86 151 edges indicating that the bacterial community had a more complex network than the fungal community and thus maintained a more robust structure de vries et al 2018 jiao et al 2022 the aggregation of modules and networks plays an important role in maintaining microbial network stability bello et al 2021 li et al 2021 the lower clustering coefficient value and higher modularity value of the adi networks indicate high covariance within modules with only a few links outside modules and these networks stabilize by limiting external perturbation to modules li et al 2021 stable networks enhance the ability of bacterial networks to withstand environmental disturbances de vries et al 2018 zhang et al 2021d therefore changes in bacterial community diversity associated with complex and stable networks were not noticeable furthermore microbial networks had positive and negative correlations suggesting cooperation and competition among microbial taxa price et al 2021 zheng et al 2018 in concordance with most studies cooperation with a high positive correlation edge was dominant in the ecological networks the adi bacterial taxa had more positive co occurrence relationships than the ck bacterial taxa implying increased cooperation suleiman et al 2019 other studies have shown that straw addition increased the positive correlation between bacterial taxa with predominantly positive covariations among rhizosphere bacteria where nutrients were usually abundant awasthi et al 2018 senbayram et al 2018 more importantly an increase in the cooperation among bacterial taxa in the ecological network is favorable for increasing the turnover rate of soil carbon muhammad et al 2021 similarly our study indicated that the increased soil oxygen content under adi enhanced cooperation and favored an increased soc content 4 3 adi significantly influenced microbial functionality soil microbial population function is based on phylogeny liu et al 2021 shifts in community composition and diversity adi vs ck were related to soil functional changes particularly the carbon cycle in terrestrial ecosystems increasing soc improves soil quality promoting plant growth chen et al 2019 veloso et al 2020 the aerobic environment associated with the adi treatments proliferated bacterial groups involved in carbon cycling and promoted soc accumulation which may contribute to increasing crop yield indeed soc had a direct positive effect on crop yield bello et al 2021 li et al 2021 moreover the mid level adi treatment a2 suppressed some groups capable of fermentation and cellulolysis cellulolysis groups are the most abundant nitrogen free soil organic matter enhancing the breakdown of stable humus to release nutrients abbas et al 2019 zhou et al 2020 the adi treatments enhanced the proliferation of microorganisms with the potential for carbon sequestration these results could explain the greater soc availability in the a2 treatment however given that the funguild analysis only provides a predictive functional map of the bacterial community further metagenomic analysis is required to assess the impact of adi on soil the funguild results showed that the adi treatment significantly increased the relative abundance of saprotroph groups a saprophyte obtains nutrients from dead host cells and participates in decomposing organic matter bello et al 2021 phosphorus cycling attarzadeh et al 2019 nutrient mobilization lekberg et al 2021 and soil structure formation beule et al 2019 in contrast pathotrophs obtain nutrition by damaging host cells attacking crops and controlling nematodes insects and other animal plant or fungal pest populations bahram et al 2018 lekberg et al 2021 in this study the ck treatment enriched pathotrophs while the adi treatment significantly increased the abundance of amf not detected in ck kr√ºger et al 2017 and ro≈ºek et al 2019 reported that aerobic environments enhanced amf growth compared to hypoxic environments increasing phosphorus availability and abiotic stress tolerance suppressing pathogen infection and promoting crop yields benitez et al 2016 found that amf stimulation in an aerobic environment improved soil fertility and crop yield because amf are common probiotics hao et al 2020 wang et al 2021 the extracorporeal hyphae of amf increase the ability of plants to absorb minerals and water hao et al 2021 veloso et al 2020 plant rhizospheres have functional fungal communities with different vegetative patterns and their interactions and associations play a key role in ecosystem services egidi et al 2019 thus it will be necessary to study the effects of adi on rhizosphere fungal community function and agricultural ecosystem stability in the future 5 conclusion this study showed that adi produced distinct patterns of soil bacterial and fungal communities increasing fungal community diversity but not affecting bacterial community diversity adi significantly changed bacterial and fungal co occurrence relationships improving the stability of bacterial networks and increasing the susceptibility of fungal communities to soil ap we propose that bacterial communities play an important role in improving soc content while fungal communities facilitate ap content the bacterial phyla gemmatimonades and firmicutes the fungal phylum mortierellomycota and a few taxa were key players in improving soc and ap in the adi treatments respectively adi at mid level dissolved oxygen concentrations increased the relative abundance of carbon and phosphorus related functional groups further studies are needed to identify the response of functional microbial communities to adi in different nutrient patterns which may open new avenues for developing rational irrigation

9226,a significant portion of new zealand s beef and sheep pastoral farming systems are located in the east coast hill country of the north island in these landscapes one of the main drivers of pasture growth is the highly variable soil water content decision making about fertiliser applications stock and feed budgeting are guided by pasture growth models which rely on soil water information however due to the difficulties related to conventional soil moisture data collection soil water dynamics are still poorly understood in hill country to capture spatial and temporal soil moisture variability on diverse terrain positions a soil moisture monitoring network was established at the field scale the patitapu soil moisture network ptsmn is composed of twenty multi sensor probes collecting data from four consecutive depths at 0 1 m intervals the paper describes the ptsmn deployment and the strategic selection of sensor locations through an extensive spatial analysis and discusses the challenges associated with the network deployment in an operating hill country farm additionally we demonstrate the non normal nature of soil moisture distribution and that year 1 and year 2 showed similarly shaped density curves in the 0 2 0 4 m soil depths indicating temporal stability similar magnitudes of temporal stability suggested the ptmsn is a temporally stable network although stability changed with depth results indicated that soil moisture variability decreased with depth and that higher mean soil moisture content was associated with low variability descending and ascending transition stages i e drying and rewetting periods resulted in the highest spatial variability as ptsmn is a member of the international soil moisture network the calibrated quality checked 2 year dataset has been made accessible online the presented soil moisture dataset is expected to contribute to the research of near surface and root zone soil water dynamics and to assist with the establishment of future networks keywords sensor networks soil moisture variability stability data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction agriculture related applications such as crop and pasture production nutrient cycling drought assessment irrigation management feed and stock budgeting often rely on information obtained by soil moisture sensors leib et al 2003 walker et al 2004 furthermore soil moisture is an element of the soil s hydrological characteristics interacts with soil infiltration runoff and evapotranspiration processes thereby affecting the amount of plant available water rodriguez iturbe et al 1999 ghajarnia et al 2020 these highly variable parameters are essential inputs in pasture growth modelling nutrient use and fertiliser application planning while near surface soil moisture data is utilised in the validation of remotely sensed products root zone soil moisture 0 15 1 m is useful for the improvement and evaluation of climate land surface and yield models moran et al 2004 gruber et al 2020 as water is the single most important resource for plant development soil moisture monitoring is highly desirable for growers as well as the scientific community woodward et al 2001 new zealand s land based primary industries including hill country pastoral systems are key drivers of the economy providing a major annual contribution to the agricultural export earnings reisinger et al 2010 statistics new zealand 2015 hill country the land with slopes greater than 15 and below an altitude of 1000 m above sea level basher et al 2008 covers 10 million hectares in new zealand and a significant 4 million hectares is designated as pastoral farmland in the north island fraser and vesely 2011 cameron 2016 due to the critical economical role and the increasing pressure on productivity the forecasted more frequent and longer dry periods the farming sector has been increasingly implementing new technological solutions to improve profitability resilience and to meet the growing food demand kenny 2001 cameron 2016 one of these is the use of soil moisture data to inform timely decision making despite the importance of soil moisture the number of datasets is low and spatially scarce efficient reliable and accurate soil water measurements are essential to facilitate a greater understanding of the interactions among the soil water plant atmosphere system due to the complexity of the terrain various soil types and land use and the interrelated environmental processes soil moisture is generally considered highly variable both temporally and spatially in hilly landscapes wilson et al 2004 petropoulos et al 2014 brocca et al 2017 depending on the application the spatial scale and the required measurement accuracy three main approaches can be distinguished to quantify soil moisture a detailed review of soil moisture sensing techniques has been recently provided by babaeian et al 2019 therefore only a brief description is given here 1 at the point and field scale in situ gravimetric methods and electromagnetic em sensor techniques provide the most accurate measurements and several ground based em instruments can generate temporally dense datasets however the implementation of these methods is often limited by the labour intensive field campaigns and the generally low spatial support soil moisture measurements can be prone to the small volume of sensed soil in case of the em probe type sensors vereecken et al 2014 despite these drawbacks em capacitance and other sensors operating in the time and frequency domains have been the most widely used for in situ soil water monitoring and to establish sensor networks this is mainly due to their low cost low power demand and easy to install properties romano 2014 babaeian et al 2019 2 at large scales i e catchment region continent or global non invasive near surface soil moisture observations can be acquired via rapidly evolving airborne and spaceborne remote sensing techniques the highest potential for soil moisture retrieval was found in the optical thermal infrared and microwave regions of the electromagnetic spectrum active and passive microwave based techniques have been among the most preferred methods for regular soil moisture monitoring across a variety of spatial scales maltese et al 2013 rahimzadeh bajgiran et al 2013 3 the latest evolvement stages of hydrological land surface models involved the increasing assimilation of remotely sensed near surface soil moisture products into the models such observations can serve as external data sources to calibrate the models and to correct for modelling biases for improved initialisation of soil moisture along the soil profile at large spatial scales moran et al 2004 koster et al 2009 hurk et al 2011 khandan et al 2022 land surface models are able to generate fine temporal resolution soil wetness information by simulating the energy and water exchange between the soil vegetation and atmosphere components described by water balance equations and flux functions moran et al 2004 leonardini et al 2020 the model performance is highly dependent on the accuracy of the input layers such as soil types climate conditions the bio and geophysical settings of the location to bridge the gap between plot and regional scale soil moisture observations clusters of invasive sensors have been increasingly deployed bogena et al 2010 terzis et al 2010 the development of micro electro mechanical and computer systems have been significant drivers for the implementation of wireless sensor networks wsns in environmental monitoring wsns are composed of a collection of spatially distributed autonomous devices called sensor nodes organised into a cooperative network to perform intended monitoring functions rawat et al 2014 the advances of wsns promise cost effective systematic remote observation of soil moisture commonly supported by a data server and a secure online dashboard barrenetxea et al 2008 bogena et al 2010 kerkez et al 2012 soil monitoring and the deployment of a wsn poses multidimensional problems on terrains where high relief man made or natural objects can prevent communication between nodes to address the variability of the landscape and to integrate the available environmental and auxiliary information geographic information systems gis can provide a powerful platform for wsn planning el emary and ramakrishnan 2014 in this study a set of gis capabilities were used to support the decision making during the network topology design while several soil moisture datasets have been made available globally through the international soil moisture network ismn there has been no information published from new zealand dorigo et al 2011 therefore this paper presents details on the gis driven deployment strategy of the field scale ptsmn provides an introductory statistical description of a 2 year dataset november 2016 and november 2018 and investigates the spatiotemporal characteristics of the ptsmn dataset the ultimate aim of this paper is to share the first quality controlled and calibrated multi year soil moisture dataset from new zealand with the scientific community through the ismn 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is situated in the southern part of the east coast hill country area of the north island of new zealand 40 745020 s 175 887320 e located between the coast and the inland ranges lang 2015 described these landscapes as an extensive stretch of land with predominantly beef and sheep pastoral farmland and forestry on rolling to steep hills interspersed with flat terraces and fertile plains the research area lies within the manawat≈´ river catchment fig 1 draining an approximately 5850 km2 watershed the chosen study site is a non irrigated hill country farmland 2600 ha in 2016 namely patitapu station where elevation ranges between 143 and 531 m above mean sea level the effective pastoral area is 1750 ha while the minimum bounding rectangle around the monitoring stations covers 1440 ha the subsurface consists of deformed mudstone sandstone limestone greywacke and argillite with river flat soils formed from alluvium intense long and short term geomorphological processes resulted in an area of undulating and rolling topography defined by a series of broad elevated valleys and steep deeply incised hill country landscapes lee and begg 2002 2 2 climatic parameters much of the area s climate and weather parameters represent high variability with common heavy rainfall events and regular summer dry periods historical climate data was extracted from a niwa weather station wairere ihuraua located 4 3 km southwest of the farm s permanent weather station 40 750032 s 175 887493 e installed in 2015 fig 1 at the niwa wairere weather station an average annual rainfall of 1146 mm ranging from 721 to 1735 mm was received in the period of 1952 2018 niwa cliflo database 2018 fig 2a depicts the monthly mean precipitation in the period of 1952 2018 obtained from niwa wairere station and for the study period extracted from the permanent weather station on site to create a basis for comparison from year to year and to understand how the data collection period compares to historical rainfall patterns the study period was divided into one year terms and will be referred to as year 1 nov 2016 oct 2017 and year 2 nov 2017 oct 2018 moreover grouping the datasets into year 1 and year 2 can assists with the description of temporal stability patterns in year 1 a total rainfall of 1055 mm was received whereas year 2 was drier with a total precipitation of 986 mm both years accumulated lower total rainfall than the historical annual average fig 2b this study adopted most slope groups recognised by the land use capability luc classification lynn et al 2009 based on which 8 2 of the research area is flat 0 3 8 8 is undulating 3 8 35 5 is rolling 7 15 25 6 is strongly rolling 15 20 14 9 is moderately steep 20 25 7 is steep 25 the slope distribution closely agrees with the parameters of a typical hill country property where significant variability is present at both macro and micro topographical level as well as in the soil resources kerr 2016 2 3 soil properties dominant soil textures are the variations of silt loam silty clay loam sandy loam and sandy silt loam with varying drainage properties ranging from weakly to moderately developed status which was supported by the results of a laser particle size analyses soil texture and especially clay content changed with depth at several nodes according to the new zealand soil classification hewitt 2010 brown soils dominate over the research site from which the prevailing group is the orthic brown along the main waterways orthic gley soils occur whereas firm brown soils were formed in the eastern parts with high altitude the sensor nodes were chosen from mostly uniform pastoral grassland surfaces where the predominant plant communities are ryegrass and clover species table 1 contains the summary of soil texture properties for each selected sensor node location acquired through laser particle size analysis and terrain parameters extracted from a digital surface model dsm the numeric laser particle size analysis results are provided in table a 1 in appendix a 2 4 ptsmn deployment architecture and communication in august 2016 the ptsmn was deployed consisting of the wireless network linking the sensor nodes and the long range transmission network using cellular reception for near real time data access via a webserver a pre determined deployment strategy was applied to place the sensor nodes the central gateway node and the relay node at specified locations halder et al 2011 the gateway and relay node deployment are briefly described in appendix b following the ptsmn installation a two month period was allowed for the soils to equilibrate and to develop an optimal soil to sensor contact the ptsmn deployment considered sufficient equipment protection against livestock and on farm activities optimising sensor distribution and ensured relatively easy node access for setup and maintenance hence as a crucial design step a criteria set was created which included macro and micro topographical features soil information land cover and land use node accessibility and foreseeable farm management plans concerning the infield wireless communication the node selection was limited to a recommended 1 7 km radio range by the manufacturer each sensor node required line of sight visibility to at least one other node therefore ptsmn was arrayed in a mesh topology to enable multi hop communication with numerous message paths using 15 radio channels in the 2 4 ghz band for network monitoring and visualisation the halo farm system an online data service developed by halo was responsible 2 4 1 instrumentation the chosen telemetry unit was developed by tag i t technologies ltd hamilton new zealand the data logging infrastructure were placed in a weatherproof enclosure which was installed on a vertical 3 m long galvanised pole extension attached to a fence post fig 3 a high range antenna was placed into a weatherproof pvc tube and mounted on the top end of the pole reaching 4 m height this positioning aimed to improve line of sight visibility and radio connectivity the soil moisture sensing unit was connected to the telemetry device by a cable running through a durable alkathene pipe sealed at the ends and buried in a 15 cm deep trench as sensing unit the aquacheck aquacheck soil moisture management durbanville south africa subsurface multi sensor probe was chosen the probe length was determined based on commonly observed shallow soils and a minimum water extraction depth of 0 35 m on hill country pasture reported by bretherton et al 2011 a single aquacheck probe was connected to a single radio unit reporting soil moisture and soil temperature readings simultaneously at every 15 min the solid state capacitance based probe is equipped with four sensors spaced at intervals of 0 1 m each sensor measures the variation in the capacitance of pairs of pieces of metal inside the probe as a proxy for soil moisture the sphere of influence can be approximated with geometric parameters of h 60 mm cylinder height r 16 mm internal radius and r 20 45 mm external radius therefore the monitored soil sections are 0 07 0 13 0 17 0 23 0 27 0 33 and 0 37 0 43 m with sensor centre lines situated at 0 1 0 2 0 3 and 0 4 m depths the sensor installation followed a standard procedure provided by precision agriculture technicians from agri optics new zealand ltd 2 4 2 a gis supported sensor deployment and positioning the ptsmn deployment posed a three dimensional problem due to the heterogeneous landscape that contains obstacles in the form of terrain relief man made and natural objects which can prevent communication between the nodes the deployment strategy included the preselection of suitable areas for transmission and sensor nodes while dealing with the limitations of the telemetry system to support decision making and to integrate the available spatial information a set of gis capabilities were used fig 4 the applied gis assisted method comprised of a land cover classification and terrain analysis including conditional evaluations and intervisibility assessment i e line of sight and viewshed raster based input layers consisted of a dsm aerial orthophotos and a hyperspectral image whereas fence lines farm tracks soil resources and cellular coverage were provided as a group of vector layers the geospatial analysis was executed in envi exelis visual information solutions boulder colorado esri arcgis arcmap esri inc redlands ca usa version 10 4 and system for automated geoscientific analysis saga software environments conrad et al 2015 2 4 3 land cover classification and terrain analysis since the sensor nodes were intended to be placed on pastoral surfaces the delineation of pastoral areas was needed for the remote spatial mapping of grass covered surfaces a supervised classification method based on machine learning was utilised on a hyperspectral image a detailed description of the applied image processing and classification procedure can be found in pullanagari et al 2017 and camps valls et al 2014 the hyperspectral image was acquired in 2016 by an aisa fenix specim ltd oulu finland imaging system mounted on a fixed wing aircraft that measures upwelling radiance between 370 and 2500 nm with a total of 448 bands the terrain analysis was executed on a hydrologically corrected 5 m x 5 m pixel size dsm for the quantitative characterisation of the terrain and the geographic suitability of an area for sensor deployment fundamental geomorphometric derivatives were computed these terrain descriptors included zero order i e elevation first order i e slope angle aspect and second order derivatives i e wetness index landform classes potential soil erosion these attributes played a key role in the ptsmn deployment and sensor node location selection due to their ability to indicate soil moisture distribution patterns drainage channels soil conditions and potentially erosion prone surfaces evans williard and schoonover 2016 appendix b presents some of the derived spatial layers of the study area fig b 1 and provides further details on the dsm 2 4 4 selection of sensor node locations a thorough analysis was carried out on the generated gis layers to preselect various candidate locations for the sensor nodes since the communication between two nodes required direct line of sight contact intervisibility analyses were undertaken in a three dimensional space over the dsm with the aim of establishing an adequate spatial distribution and coverage the sensor node locations node i were chosen on combinations of slope and aspect classes table 1 and derived luc categories to represent a variety of topographical positions and agriculturally important soils the process was driven by a two step conditional decision approach consisting of a spatial candidate area pre selection followed by an on site evaluation fig 5 the criteria set was set up by considering local topographical variations spatial analysis of generated layers and considered farm operations and field observations a typical sensor node was situated on pastoral land with low soil erosion risk indicated by low ls factor positioned farther than 5 m from local stream edges represented a given slope and aspect class and located within 100 m to a farm track furthermore the effective communication range of 1 7 km had to be satisfied along with the line of sight visibility criteria considering a 4 m offset from the ground to account for the antenna position if any of these conditions were evaluated as false a new location was investigated once every sensor node location had passed the conditional pre selection process the high suitability areas were visited on site this procedure involved the confirmation of intervisibility and whether a node was situated on well grown uniform pasture surface free of obstacles and shading the sufficient soil depth was tested and micro topographical features were examined to avoid local water accumulating depressions and irregularities e g stock tracks or soil erosion surfaces accessibility and farm management plans were reviewed to ensure that the assorted locations were not subject to changes in management plans 2 5 soil moisture distribution spatial variability and time stability descriptive statistics and the identification of network wide statistical distribution of soil moisture were completed to gain insights into the main properties of the collected dataset these descriptors are meaningful since several environmental processes have been characterised by non linear relations to soil moisture within a remote sensing footprint famiglietti et al 1999 the spatial and temporal variability of soil moisture has been studied by an increasing number of papers to define attributes that control soil moisture distribution as reported by the review of vanderlinden et al 2012 thus in this study the spatial variability of soil moisture was assessed by the calculation of spatial field mean standard deviation sd and coefficient of variation cv to describe relative variability famiglietti et al 1999 brocca et al 2007 molina et al 2014 percy et al 2020 to investigate the temporal stability of ptsmn the method proposed by vachaud et al 1985 was chosen which has been applied by several studies as a parametric test to reveal differences in constancy of temporal stability of soil moisture networks cosh et al 2004 2014 mart√≠nez fern√°ndez and ceballos 2005 starks et al 2006 xu et al 2021 the temporal persistence of spatial pattern is expressed by the mean relative difference mrd or Œ¥ i and the standard deviation of the relative difference sdrd or œÉ Œ¥ ij computed for daily averaged soil moisture measurements the property of Œ¥ i being positive or negative indicates whether a given node i is generally drier or wetter than the network wide mean soil moisture the lower the sdrd the more stable the node is compared with the network average following the equations suggested by vachaud et al 1985 the mrd for each node was computed as per eq 1 as follows 1 Œ¥ i 1 m j 1 m s ij s j s j where s ij is the soil moisture content at node i on day j s j is the network wide mean soil moisture on day j and m is the number of observations during the study period the sdrd was computed as per eq 2 to describe the variability of relative differences at a given location 2 œÉ Œ¥ ij 1 m j 1 m Œ¥ ij Œ¥ i 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 sensor calibration and data quality the aquacheck sensor probe transforms the frequency readings to scaled frequency as raw output ranging from 0 to 100 where 0 is equal to a reading in open air and 100 when the sensor is immersed in distilled water to calculate soil moisture scaled frequency values are commonly converted using empirical laboratory based calibration curves the conversion is not a built in function therefore the device is offered with factory calibration equations for six soil textures e g sand clay silt loam loam clay and generic composited from sand silt loam and clay soils agri optics 2017 the resulting soil moisture output is often converted to volumetric soil moisture m3m 3 the latter being used in this paper when referred to soil moisture the manufacturer provided calibration functions were assessed against a reference dataset by hajdu et al 2019 an underestimation of the true soil water content was observed by a network wide root mean squared error rmse of 0 106 m3m 3 therefore various site specific calibration methods have been developed to improve accuracy the calibration was based on thermo gravimetric measurements at dry moderately wet and wet soil water states by collecting 400 reference soil samples the ptsmn dataset was generated by applying the highest level sensor specific calibration functions generated by hajdu et al 2019 achieving a network wide rmse of 0 019 m3m 3 the descriptive statistical parameters of the calibrated dataset are summarised in table 2 for each soil depth for year 1 and year 2 the network wide mean metrics were derived by amalgamating measurements from 20 aquacheck probes the number of successful and missing readings are also given in table 2 3 2 soil moisture distribution in this paper the non parametric kernel density estimation technique was employed to assess the nature of distribution shape regarding the entire soil moisture data population using the 15 min readings fig 6 the mean values were plotted as dotted vertical lines originating from table 2 which also contains the number of readings used to create the distribution curves the years were plotted separately at each depth to be able to identify potential temporal stability trends and the peaks where values concentrated in each year a shapiro wilk statistical test ghasemi and zahediasl 2012 resulted in p value 0 001 in all cases table 2 indicating high probability of non normal distribution in these hilly landscapes the inspection of fig 7 reveals the distinct differences in the mean soil moisture comparing year 1 and year 2 the analysis of density curves showed that most distributions exhibited multimodal behaviour the longer tail towards the left in each depth confirm the negative skewness this means that a large number of soil moisture readings were lower than the average and it also suggests that soil water content has frequently reached saturation kaiser and mcglynn 2018 positive skewness usually corresponds to conditions when soil moisture frequently reach or decrease near the level of wilting point furthermore the length of the left tail increased in year 2 compared to year 1 due to the drier conditions in year 2 year 2 was drier than year 1 as it is indicated by the mean soil moisture content differences particularly in the upper soil layers 0 1 and 0 2 m in year 1 the 0 1 m soil depth was generally the wettest 0 374 m3 m 3 while in year 2 the soil at 0 4 m held the highest amount of water 0 344 m3 m 3 table 2 the soil layers at 0 2 and 0 3 m depths showed very similar mean soil moisture values in year 1 while a 0 01 m3 m 3 difference was observed in year 2 the variance of soil moisture decreased with soil depth in both years although larger cv and sd values occurred in year 2 suggesting that higher soil moisture variability occurred during the drier year the minimum and maximum mean daily soil moisture values were lower for every depth in year 2 than in year 1 as it was expected the near surface layer dried out the most with soil moisture levels dropping from 0 431 to 0 233 m3 m 3 in year 1 and from 0 458 to 0 201 m3 m 3 in year 2 table 2 in terms of kurtosis platykurtic behaviour was observed for both years although year 2 was assessed to be closer to normal distribution than year 1 the interquartile ranges at the 0 1 and 0 3 m soil depths showed similar values whereas the 0 1 m soil depth measurements were the wettest except for the 25 percentile the difference between year 1 and year 2 is also represented by the shape of the density curves in general the negative skewness was more apparent in year 1 and the skewness values of year 2 were closer to zero suggesting a more symmetric data distribution interestingly some studies reported normal distribution for surface soil moisture nielsen biggar and erh 1973 such as on a northeast facing slope in spain and positively skewed distributions were also observed by charpentier and groffman 1992 in a valley on flat and sloping land in kansas according to famiglietti et al 1999 and vereecken et al 2014 flat surfaces can often be characterised by normally distributed soil moisture probability density functions due to the less variable soil physical and hydraulic properties on the other hand the distribution of soil moisture on terrains with significant relief does not necessarily follow a normal pattern i e it may be better described by non normal distributions vereecken et al 2014 noted that the normality of the probability density function of soil moisture is not an essential requirement for the application of geostatistical tools in complex terrain the lateral redistribution has an increased importance as it was shown by western bl√∂schl and grayson 1998 during wet conditions the most significant predictor for spatial soil moisture distribution was found to be the upslope contributing or specific area whereas in dry conditions aspect was the best predictor for soil moisture spatial patterns famiglietti et al 1998 western et al 1999 towards the deeper sections in the soil profile the density curves had very similar shape for year 1 and year 2 fig 6 showed characteristic peaks occurring around certain soil moisture levels for example at 0 35 m3 m 3 at 0 2 m depth and 0 42 m3 m 3 at 0 4 m depth that can indicate that the spatial soil moisture patterns have a certain temporal stability at deeper soil depths therefore temporal stability of the spatial patterns will be further investigated in the following sections 3 3 spatial variability and temporal dynamics the spatial mean sd and cv were computed on a daily basis allowing the examination of spatial patterns in terms of temporal stability and the comparison to other studies peng et al 2016 fig 7 shows the daily spatial mean soil moisture time series for each depth along with daily rainfall the spatial mean varied synchronously in all soil depths showing apparent response of soil moisture to precipitation events the soil moisture curves revealed the more dynamic nature of the topmost soil layer compared to the deeper layers due to the interaction with meteorological forcing this also indicates decreasing temporal variability and increasing temporal stability with depth the temporal occurrence of crossovers i e when the soil moisture at 0 1 m drops below soil moisture at the 0 4 m depth mark important dates for farm practices such as drainage management crossover events occurred 3 times during these 2 years i e on 22 12 2016 07 11 2017 and 25 10 2018 represented by dashed lines in fig 8 this annual sequential shift from december to the end of october suggest that multi depth soil moisture trends can be used a proxy to detect long term changes in rewetting and drying periods soil moisture values decreased continuously from the 8 nov 2016 until mid january 2017 when the driest day occurred in year 1 from mid january the spatial mean increased until mid may 2017 when most node locations reached field capacity or near saturation levels the near saturated state was maintained until the 8 oct 2017 when another drying cycle started the water stored in the soil was lost considerably faster at the end of year 1 reaching low soil water levels in early december 2017 during year 2 summer season the research area did not receive significant amount of rainfall a total of 172 mm compared to the 207 mm in year 1 although evaporation rates were higher due to the elevated air and soil temperature the summer low and the lowest soil moisture content during the two year long recording time was reached on the 9 feb 2018 the dry season lasted longer in year 2 than in year 1 and following year 2 s dry season the rewetting process in year 2 was not as rapid as in year 1 resulting in near saturation conditions occurring in june 2018 as opposed to may in 2017 this wet stage lasted until early september 2018 the range of temporal soil moisture change was the largest at the 0 1 m depth reaching 0 27 m3 m 3 with a minimum occurring on the 18 feb 2018 and maximum on the 13 july 2017 the range decreased with depth reducing to 0 21 m3 m 3 at 0 2 m 0 172 m3 m 3 at 0 3 m and 0 14 m3 m 3 at 0 4 m depth as the near surface layer is exposed to the largest effects of atmospheric forcing the sd and the cv showed the largest changes depicting more time variance in the spatial pattern behaviour than deeper parts of the profile the temporal stability of the spatial variability in the deeper soil were more pronounced as indicated by the lower sd and cv than in the 0 1 m soil layer the cv and sd were highest in the dry seasons jan feb 2017 and dec 2017 march 2018 and the wetting periods in autumn mar apr 2017 and mar may 2018 in both years the variability decreased noticeably through the wet stages when soil moisture levels increased to 0 26 0 29 m3 m 3 at 0 1 m soil depth and reached its minimum at the end of the wet seasons similar findings were reported by korres et al 2015 on various spatial scales in western germany based on nine different datasets during a two year period as well as by percy et al 2020 on planar hillslopes in this study the minimum cv values were associated with soil conditions just below saturation point fig 7 that was also found by harter and zhang 1999 and owe jones and schmugge 1982 in heterogeneous soils in south dakota usa several other studies found that spatial variability decreased with increasing soil moisture content famiglietti et al 1999 hu et al 2011 korres et al 2013 resonating well with our observations the cv and sd parameters showed increasing trends during the transition from wet to dry stage although the values were usually lower than changing from dry to wet state the differences in cv and sd among sub periods were the largest in the 0 1 m depth and less significant towards the deeper layers while the cv line is relatively smooth for the 0 1 m layer heavy rainfall events often caused large peaks in cv and sd in the deeper horizons 3 4 time stability analysis fig 8 shows the nodes ranked by mrd values with error bars indicating sdrd to assess soil moisture variability time stability and bias at every node compared to the spatial mean represented by the green line the results are provided for each soil depth as well as for the monitored soil profile mean the node with the lowest mrdand sdrd values is generally considered the most time stable location and the most representative of the spatial mean this method is efficiently used for identification of sampling locations that systematically show overestimation or underestimation of the field mean soil moisture it is apparent that some nodes were consistently wetter while others consistently drier than the mean value this mainly relates to the soil textural properties determining soil water holding capacity the topographic position of the node including aspect and steepness fig 9 suggests that during the experiment the temporal stabilities were not entirely consistent through the soil profile negative mrd values were found at each soil depth for four nodes on the north aspects node 5 8 13 and 20 two nodes on the west node 11 and east facing node 18 steep slopes on a flat node 6 and on an undulating south facing surface node 9 although their rank slightly changed along the soil profile their time stability can be considered moderate positive mrd values occurred at node 19 on a rolling slope with north aspect at a rolling node 16 and a strongly rolling node 7 west facing stations at locations on south aspect with rolling node 1 and moderately steep node 14 slopes at two east facing nodes on strongly rolling node 3 and moderately steep node 4 slopes and at two nodes situated on flat areas node 2 and 15 according to their rank and position most of these locations would considerably overestimate the field mean soil moisture value although their ranks were not consistent with soil depth overall node 7 and 8 showed temporal stability and represent the driest and wettest water content and within the ptsmn in terms of sdrd the 0 1 m and 0 2 m soil depths demonstrated the greatest values as expected due to higher sensitivity to the changes in the climatic parameters while smaller sdrd values were represented by the 0 3 and 0 4 m soil depths indicating significantly less variation sdrd values exhibited similar magnitude which suggest the ptmsn is a temporally stable network although the degree of stability changes with depth 3 5 access to the ptsmn dataset and the use of data the described ptsmn data has been hosted by ismn and made globally available dorigo et al 2021 individuals and organisations can freely retrieve the data from the ismn database through an online interface https ismn earth en last access 29 august 2022 the ptsmn dataset was visually and statistically examined pre processed harmonised and quality checked for publishing via the wider ismn database which makes ptsmn comparable with 71 other soil moisture networks and 2822 monitoring stations across the globe the occurring data gaps are flagged but not filled the completeness of the dataset is approximately 98 due to connection and battery recharging problems mainly during the wintertime at this stage 2 years of data is available between nov 2016 and nov 2018 on an hourly basis through the ismn further datasets will be potentially uploaded subject to sufficient funding and network maintenance here we share the download requests statistics that was provided by the ismn fig 9 downloads per country are summarised in table 3 while downloads per continent and per geo societal benefit are presented in fig 9 in total 495 download requests were received between 1 jan 2020 and 30 june 2021 additionally an increasing interest was indicated by the download statistics year by year not shown in table 3 4 conclusions we deployed a wsn that is capable of monitoring soil moisture at the field scale on a hill country pastoral system providing information about the spatial and temporal variability of soil wetness in the top 0 43 m soil layer this study revealed that soil moisture distribution can be characterised with non normality on these complex terrains year 1 and year 2 showed similarly shaped kernel density curves in the 0 2 0 4 m soil depths indicating temporal stability in the distribution year 2 the drier part of the data collection period represented larger soil moisture variability than year 1 although the value and range of cv and sd of soil moisture decreased with soil depth in both years the range of soil moisture readings were the largest in the 0 1 m soil depth while the spread became narrower with increasing soil depth we found that cv of soil moisture was the lowest when the soils were near saturation or above field capacity showing negligible spatial variability and highest in the descending and ascending transition stages i e drying and rewetting periods temporal stability analysis revealed that node 7 situated on a west facing strongly rolling slope is the wettest node while node 8 located on a steep north facing surface represented the driest conditions within the ptsmn the lowest mrd value indicates that node 12 can be among the most representative locations although the definite selection of the most representative location of ptsmn would require a more detailed temporal stability analysis which will be discussed in a future paper these findings can help farmer managers to understand how topographical positions drive soil moisture variability which directly has an impact on feed availability in hill country pastoral systems the wsn operated mostly perfectly during the study period although we have experienced some weaknesses regarding the power support at the gateway and certain sensor nodes during the wintertime this issue has been partly attributed to the recharging performance of the solar panels on valley bottoms and south facing slope as well as the shadows produced by the high relief landscape this could be avoided by including shadow detection and the assessment of incoming solar radiation over the seasons as part of the wsn planning procedure using a dsm additionally some of the sensor nodes located 3 5 4 km line of sight from each other could establish data transmission these findings should be taken into account if these devices are installed either on flat or hilly terrain which may improve the versatility and flexibility of future networks including localisation and sensor node optimization for representative soil moisture monitoring soil water dynamics in hill country have not been studied extensively and the available soil moisture information is highly limited in new zealand ptsmn is the first of its kind network in new zealand s hill country providing valuable information for researchers to support earth observation land surface model validation and training remote sensing applications yield modelling and the understanding of soil moisture variability in hilly landscapes on the other hand based on the amount of download requests ptsmn is a valuable member of the ismn and there is need for sharing soil moisture datasets with the research community a wide range of research areas have been using the soil specifically calibrated ptsmn dataset globally we expect that this paper will significantly increase the ptsmn dataset visibility and will provide useful details for current and future data users the long term future of ismn has been recently secured and will be operated by the german ministry of transport and digital infrastructure this means that by the support of ismn our understanding of soil moisture dynamics and its relation to topography or environmental processes can be further improved globally as well as in new zealand

9226,a significant portion of new zealand s beef and sheep pastoral farming systems are located in the east coast hill country of the north island in these landscapes one of the main drivers of pasture growth is the highly variable soil water content decision making about fertiliser applications stock and feed budgeting are guided by pasture growth models which rely on soil water information however due to the difficulties related to conventional soil moisture data collection soil water dynamics are still poorly understood in hill country to capture spatial and temporal soil moisture variability on diverse terrain positions a soil moisture monitoring network was established at the field scale the patitapu soil moisture network ptsmn is composed of twenty multi sensor probes collecting data from four consecutive depths at 0 1 m intervals the paper describes the ptsmn deployment and the strategic selection of sensor locations through an extensive spatial analysis and discusses the challenges associated with the network deployment in an operating hill country farm additionally we demonstrate the non normal nature of soil moisture distribution and that year 1 and year 2 showed similarly shaped density curves in the 0 2 0 4 m soil depths indicating temporal stability similar magnitudes of temporal stability suggested the ptmsn is a temporally stable network although stability changed with depth results indicated that soil moisture variability decreased with depth and that higher mean soil moisture content was associated with low variability descending and ascending transition stages i e drying and rewetting periods resulted in the highest spatial variability as ptsmn is a member of the international soil moisture network the calibrated quality checked 2 year dataset has been made accessible online the presented soil moisture dataset is expected to contribute to the research of near surface and root zone soil water dynamics and to assist with the establishment of future networks keywords sensor networks soil moisture variability stability data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction agriculture related applications such as crop and pasture production nutrient cycling drought assessment irrigation management feed and stock budgeting often rely on information obtained by soil moisture sensors leib et al 2003 walker et al 2004 furthermore soil moisture is an element of the soil s hydrological characteristics interacts with soil infiltration runoff and evapotranspiration processes thereby affecting the amount of plant available water rodriguez iturbe et al 1999 ghajarnia et al 2020 these highly variable parameters are essential inputs in pasture growth modelling nutrient use and fertiliser application planning while near surface soil moisture data is utilised in the validation of remotely sensed products root zone soil moisture 0 15 1 m is useful for the improvement and evaluation of climate land surface and yield models moran et al 2004 gruber et al 2020 as water is the single most important resource for plant development soil moisture monitoring is highly desirable for growers as well as the scientific community woodward et al 2001 new zealand s land based primary industries including hill country pastoral systems are key drivers of the economy providing a major annual contribution to the agricultural export earnings reisinger et al 2010 statistics new zealand 2015 hill country the land with slopes greater than 15 and below an altitude of 1000 m above sea level basher et al 2008 covers 10 million hectares in new zealand and a significant 4 million hectares is designated as pastoral farmland in the north island fraser and vesely 2011 cameron 2016 due to the critical economical role and the increasing pressure on productivity the forecasted more frequent and longer dry periods the farming sector has been increasingly implementing new technological solutions to improve profitability resilience and to meet the growing food demand kenny 2001 cameron 2016 one of these is the use of soil moisture data to inform timely decision making despite the importance of soil moisture the number of datasets is low and spatially scarce efficient reliable and accurate soil water measurements are essential to facilitate a greater understanding of the interactions among the soil water plant atmosphere system due to the complexity of the terrain various soil types and land use and the interrelated environmental processes soil moisture is generally considered highly variable both temporally and spatially in hilly landscapes wilson et al 2004 petropoulos et al 2014 brocca et al 2017 depending on the application the spatial scale and the required measurement accuracy three main approaches can be distinguished to quantify soil moisture a detailed review of soil moisture sensing techniques has been recently provided by babaeian et al 2019 therefore only a brief description is given here 1 at the point and field scale in situ gravimetric methods and electromagnetic em sensor techniques provide the most accurate measurements and several ground based em instruments can generate temporally dense datasets however the implementation of these methods is often limited by the labour intensive field campaigns and the generally low spatial support soil moisture measurements can be prone to the small volume of sensed soil in case of the em probe type sensors vereecken et al 2014 despite these drawbacks em capacitance and other sensors operating in the time and frequency domains have been the most widely used for in situ soil water monitoring and to establish sensor networks this is mainly due to their low cost low power demand and easy to install properties romano 2014 babaeian et al 2019 2 at large scales i e catchment region continent or global non invasive near surface soil moisture observations can be acquired via rapidly evolving airborne and spaceborne remote sensing techniques the highest potential for soil moisture retrieval was found in the optical thermal infrared and microwave regions of the electromagnetic spectrum active and passive microwave based techniques have been among the most preferred methods for regular soil moisture monitoring across a variety of spatial scales maltese et al 2013 rahimzadeh bajgiran et al 2013 3 the latest evolvement stages of hydrological land surface models involved the increasing assimilation of remotely sensed near surface soil moisture products into the models such observations can serve as external data sources to calibrate the models and to correct for modelling biases for improved initialisation of soil moisture along the soil profile at large spatial scales moran et al 2004 koster et al 2009 hurk et al 2011 khandan et al 2022 land surface models are able to generate fine temporal resolution soil wetness information by simulating the energy and water exchange between the soil vegetation and atmosphere components described by water balance equations and flux functions moran et al 2004 leonardini et al 2020 the model performance is highly dependent on the accuracy of the input layers such as soil types climate conditions the bio and geophysical settings of the location to bridge the gap between plot and regional scale soil moisture observations clusters of invasive sensors have been increasingly deployed bogena et al 2010 terzis et al 2010 the development of micro electro mechanical and computer systems have been significant drivers for the implementation of wireless sensor networks wsns in environmental monitoring wsns are composed of a collection of spatially distributed autonomous devices called sensor nodes organised into a cooperative network to perform intended monitoring functions rawat et al 2014 the advances of wsns promise cost effective systematic remote observation of soil moisture commonly supported by a data server and a secure online dashboard barrenetxea et al 2008 bogena et al 2010 kerkez et al 2012 soil monitoring and the deployment of a wsn poses multidimensional problems on terrains where high relief man made or natural objects can prevent communication between nodes to address the variability of the landscape and to integrate the available environmental and auxiliary information geographic information systems gis can provide a powerful platform for wsn planning el emary and ramakrishnan 2014 in this study a set of gis capabilities were used to support the decision making during the network topology design while several soil moisture datasets have been made available globally through the international soil moisture network ismn there has been no information published from new zealand dorigo et al 2011 therefore this paper presents details on the gis driven deployment strategy of the field scale ptsmn provides an introductory statistical description of a 2 year dataset november 2016 and november 2018 and investigates the spatiotemporal characteristics of the ptsmn dataset the ultimate aim of this paper is to share the first quality controlled and calibrated multi year soil moisture dataset from new zealand with the scientific community through the ismn 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is situated in the southern part of the east coast hill country area of the north island of new zealand 40 745020 s 175 887320 e located between the coast and the inland ranges lang 2015 described these landscapes as an extensive stretch of land with predominantly beef and sheep pastoral farmland and forestry on rolling to steep hills interspersed with flat terraces and fertile plains the research area lies within the manawat≈´ river catchment fig 1 draining an approximately 5850 km2 watershed the chosen study site is a non irrigated hill country farmland 2600 ha in 2016 namely patitapu station where elevation ranges between 143 and 531 m above mean sea level the effective pastoral area is 1750 ha while the minimum bounding rectangle around the monitoring stations covers 1440 ha the subsurface consists of deformed mudstone sandstone limestone greywacke and argillite with river flat soils formed from alluvium intense long and short term geomorphological processes resulted in an area of undulating and rolling topography defined by a series of broad elevated valleys and steep deeply incised hill country landscapes lee and begg 2002 2 2 climatic parameters much of the area s climate and weather parameters represent high variability with common heavy rainfall events and regular summer dry periods historical climate data was extracted from a niwa weather station wairere ihuraua located 4 3 km southwest of the farm s permanent weather station 40 750032 s 175 887493 e installed in 2015 fig 1 at the niwa wairere weather station an average annual rainfall of 1146 mm ranging from 721 to 1735 mm was received in the period of 1952 2018 niwa cliflo database 2018 fig 2a depicts the monthly mean precipitation in the period of 1952 2018 obtained from niwa wairere station and for the study period extracted from the permanent weather station on site to create a basis for comparison from year to year and to understand how the data collection period compares to historical rainfall patterns the study period was divided into one year terms and will be referred to as year 1 nov 2016 oct 2017 and year 2 nov 2017 oct 2018 moreover grouping the datasets into year 1 and year 2 can assists with the description of temporal stability patterns in year 1 a total rainfall of 1055 mm was received whereas year 2 was drier with a total precipitation of 986 mm both years accumulated lower total rainfall than the historical annual average fig 2b this study adopted most slope groups recognised by the land use capability luc classification lynn et al 2009 based on which 8 2 of the research area is flat 0 3 8 8 is undulating 3 8 35 5 is rolling 7 15 25 6 is strongly rolling 15 20 14 9 is moderately steep 20 25 7 is steep 25 the slope distribution closely agrees with the parameters of a typical hill country property where significant variability is present at both macro and micro topographical level as well as in the soil resources kerr 2016 2 3 soil properties dominant soil textures are the variations of silt loam silty clay loam sandy loam and sandy silt loam with varying drainage properties ranging from weakly to moderately developed status which was supported by the results of a laser particle size analyses soil texture and especially clay content changed with depth at several nodes according to the new zealand soil classification hewitt 2010 brown soils dominate over the research site from which the prevailing group is the orthic brown along the main waterways orthic gley soils occur whereas firm brown soils were formed in the eastern parts with high altitude the sensor nodes were chosen from mostly uniform pastoral grassland surfaces where the predominant plant communities are ryegrass and clover species table 1 contains the summary of soil texture properties for each selected sensor node location acquired through laser particle size analysis and terrain parameters extracted from a digital surface model dsm the numeric laser particle size analysis results are provided in table a 1 in appendix a 2 4 ptsmn deployment architecture and communication in august 2016 the ptsmn was deployed consisting of the wireless network linking the sensor nodes and the long range transmission network using cellular reception for near real time data access via a webserver a pre determined deployment strategy was applied to place the sensor nodes the central gateway node and the relay node at specified locations halder et al 2011 the gateway and relay node deployment are briefly described in appendix b following the ptsmn installation a two month period was allowed for the soils to equilibrate and to develop an optimal soil to sensor contact the ptsmn deployment considered sufficient equipment protection against livestock and on farm activities optimising sensor distribution and ensured relatively easy node access for setup and maintenance hence as a crucial design step a criteria set was created which included macro and micro topographical features soil information land cover and land use node accessibility and foreseeable farm management plans concerning the infield wireless communication the node selection was limited to a recommended 1 7 km radio range by the manufacturer each sensor node required line of sight visibility to at least one other node therefore ptsmn was arrayed in a mesh topology to enable multi hop communication with numerous message paths using 15 radio channels in the 2 4 ghz band for network monitoring and visualisation the halo farm system an online data service developed by halo was responsible 2 4 1 instrumentation the chosen telemetry unit was developed by tag i t technologies ltd hamilton new zealand the data logging infrastructure were placed in a weatherproof enclosure which was installed on a vertical 3 m long galvanised pole extension attached to a fence post fig 3 a high range antenna was placed into a weatherproof pvc tube and mounted on the top end of the pole reaching 4 m height this positioning aimed to improve line of sight visibility and radio connectivity the soil moisture sensing unit was connected to the telemetry device by a cable running through a durable alkathene pipe sealed at the ends and buried in a 15 cm deep trench as sensing unit the aquacheck aquacheck soil moisture management durbanville south africa subsurface multi sensor probe was chosen the probe length was determined based on commonly observed shallow soils and a minimum water extraction depth of 0 35 m on hill country pasture reported by bretherton et al 2011 a single aquacheck probe was connected to a single radio unit reporting soil moisture and soil temperature readings simultaneously at every 15 min the solid state capacitance based probe is equipped with four sensors spaced at intervals of 0 1 m each sensor measures the variation in the capacitance of pairs of pieces of metal inside the probe as a proxy for soil moisture the sphere of influence can be approximated with geometric parameters of h 60 mm cylinder height r 16 mm internal radius and r 20 45 mm external radius therefore the monitored soil sections are 0 07 0 13 0 17 0 23 0 27 0 33 and 0 37 0 43 m with sensor centre lines situated at 0 1 0 2 0 3 and 0 4 m depths the sensor installation followed a standard procedure provided by precision agriculture technicians from agri optics new zealand ltd 2 4 2 a gis supported sensor deployment and positioning the ptsmn deployment posed a three dimensional problem due to the heterogeneous landscape that contains obstacles in the form of terrain relief man made and natural objects which can prevent communication between the nodes the deployment strategy included the preselection of suitable areas for transmission and sensor nodes while dealing with the limitations of the telemetry system to support decision making and to integrate the available spatial information a set of gis capabilities were used fig 4 the applied gis assisted method comprised of a land cover classification and terrain analysis including conditional evaluations and intervisibility assessment i e line of sight and viewshed raster based input layers consisted of a dsm aerial orthophotos and a hyperspectral image whereas fence lines farm tracks soil resources and cellular coverage were provided as a group of vector layers the geospatial analysis was executed in envi exelis visual information solutions boulder colorado esri arcgis arcmap esri inc redlands ca usa version 10 4 and system for automated geoscientific analysis saga software environments conrad et al 2015 2 4 3 land cover classification and terrain analysis since the sensor nodes were intended to be placed on pastoral surfaces the delineation of pastoral areas was needed for the remote spatial mapping of grass covered surfaces a supervised classification method based on machine learning was utilised on a hyperspectral image a detailed description of the applied image processing and classification procedure can be found in pullanagari et al 2017 and camps valls et al 2014 the hyperspectral image was acquired in 2016 by an aisa fenix specim ltd oulu finland imaging system mounted on a fixed wing aircraft that measures upwelling radiance between 370 and 2500 nm with a total of 448 bands the terrain analysis was executed on a hydrologically corrected 5 m x 5 m pixel size dsm for the quantitative characterisation of the terrain and the geographic suitability of an area for sensor deployment fundamental geomorphometric derivatives were computed these terrain descriptors included zero order i e elevation first order i e slope angle aspect and second order derivatives i e wetness index landform classes potential soil erosion these attributes played a key role in the ptsmn deployment and sensor node location selection due to their ability to indicate soil moisture distribution patterns drainage channels soil conditions and potentially erosion prone surfaces evans williard and schoonover 2016 appendix b presents some of the derived spatial layers of the study area fig b 1 and provides further details on the dsm 2 4 4 selection of sensor node locations a thorough analysis was carried out on the generated gis layers to preselect various candidate locations for the sensor nodes since the communication between two nodes required direct line of sight contact intervisibility analyses were undertaken in a three dimensional space over the dsm with the aim of establishing an adequate spatial distribution and coverage the sensor node locations node i were chosen on combinations of slope and aspect classes table 1 and derived luc categories to represent a variety of topographical positions and agriculturally important soils the process was driven by a two step conditional decision approach consisting of a spatial candidate area pre selection followed by an on site evaluation fig 5 the criteria set was set up by considering local topographical variations spatial analysis of generated layers and considered farm operations and field observations a typical sensor node was situated on pastoral land with low soil erosion risk indicated by low ls factor positioned farther than 5 m from local stream edges represented a given slope and aspect class and located within 100 m to a farm track furthermore the effective communication range of 1 7 km had to be satisfied along with the line of sight visibility criteria considering a 4 m offset from the ground to account for the antenna position if any of these conditions were evaluated as false a new location was investigated once every sensor node location had passed the conditional pre selection process the high suitability areas were visited on site this procedure involved the confirmation of intervisibility and whether a node was situated on well grown uniform pasture surface free of obstacles and shading the sufficient soil depth was tested and micro topographical features were examined to avoid local water accumulating depressions and irregularities e g stock tracks or soil erosion surfaces accessibility and farm management plans were reviewed to ensure that the assorted locations were not subject to changes in management plans 2 5 soil moisture distribution spatial variability and time stability descriptive statistics and the identification of network wide statistical distribution of soil moisture were completed to gain insights into the main properties of the collected dataset these descriptors are meaningful since several environmental processes have been characterised by non linear relations to soil moisture within a remote sensing footprint famiglietti et al 1999 the spatial and temporal variability of soil moisture has been studied by an increasing number of papers to define attributes that control soil moisture distribution as reported by the review of vanderlinden et al 2012 thus in this study the spatial variability of soil moisture was assessed by the calculation of spatial field mean standard deviation sd and coefficient of variation cv to describe relative variability famiglietti et al 1999 brocca et al 2007 molina et al 2014 percy et al 2020 to investigate the temporal stability of ptsmn the method proposed by vachaud et al 1985 was chosen which has been applied by several studies as a parametric test to reveal differences in constancy of temporal stability of soil moisture networks cosh et al 2004 2014 mart√≠nez fern√°ndez and ceballos 2005 starks et al 2006 xu et al 2021 the temporal persistence of spatial pattern is expressed by the mean relative difference mrd or Œ¥ i and the standard deviation of the relative difference sdrd or œÉ Œ¥ ij computed for daily averaged soil moisture measurements the property of Œ¥ i being positive or negative indicates whether a given node i is generally drier or wetter than the network wide mean soil moisture the lower the sdrd the more stable the node is compared with the network average following the equations suggested by vachaud et al 1985 the mrd for each node was computed as per eq 1 as follows 1 Œ¥ i 1 m j 1 m s ij s j s j where s ij is the soil moisture content at node i on day j s j is the network wide mean soil moisture on day j and m is the number of observations during the study period the sdrd was computed as per eq 2 to describe the variability of relative differences at a given location 2 œÉ Œ¥ ij 1 m j 1 m Œ¥ ij Œ¥ i 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 sensor calibration and data quality the aquacheck sensor probe transforms the frequency readings to scaled frequency as raw output ranging from 0 to 100 where 0 is equal to a reading in open air and 100 when the sensor is immersed in distilled water to calculate soil moisture scaled frequency values are commonly converted using empirical laboratory based calibration curves the conversion is not a built in function therefore the device is offered with factory calibration equations for six soil textures e g sand clay silt loam loam clay and generic composited from sand silt loam and clay soils agri optics 2017 the resulting soil moisture output is often converted to volumetric soil moisture m3m 3 the latter being used in this paper when referred to soil moisture the manufacturer provided calibration functions were assessed against a reference dataset by hajdu et al 2019 an underestimation of the true soil water content was observed by a network wide root mean squared error rmse of 0 106 m3m 3 therefore various site specific calibration methods have been developed to improve accuracy the calibration was based on thermo gravimetric measurements at dry moderately wet and wet soil water states by collecting 400 reference soil samples the ptsmn dataset was generated by applying the highest level sensor specific calibration functions generated by hajdu et al 2019 achieving a network wide rmse of 0 019 m3m 3 the descriptive statistical parameters of the calibrated dataset are summarised in table 2 for each soil depth for year 1 and year 2 the network wide mean metrics were derived by amalgamating measurements from 20 aquacheck probes the number of successful and missing readings are also given in table 2 3 2 soil moisture distribution in this paper the non parametric kernel density estimation technique was employed to assess the nature of distribution shape regarding the entire soil moisture data population using the 15 min readings fig 6 the mean values were plotted as dotted vertical lines originating from table 2 which also contains the number of readings used to create the distribution curves the years were plotted separately at each depth to be able to identify potential temporal stability trends and the peaks where values concentrated in each year a shapiro wilk statistical test ghasemi and zahediasl 2012 resulted in p value 0 001 in all cases table 2 indicating high probability of non normal distribution in these hilly landscapes the inspection of fig 7 reveals the distinct differences in the mean soil moisture comparing year 1 and year 2 the analysis of density curves showed that most distributions exhibited multimodal behaviour the longer tail towards the left in each depth confirm the negative skewness this means that a large number of soil moisture readings were lower than the average and it also suggests that soil water content has frequently reached saturation kaiser and mcglynn 2018 positive skewness usually corresponds to conditions when soil moisture frequently reach or decrease near the level of wilting point furthermore the length of the left tail increased in year 2 compared to year 1 due to the drier conditions in year 2 year 2 was drier than year 1 as it is indicated by the mean soil moisture content differences particularly in the upper soil layers 0 1 and 0 2 m in year 1 the 0 1 m soil depth was generally the wettest 0 374 m3 m 3 while in year 2 the soil at 0 4 m held the highest amount of water 0 344 m3 m 3 table 2 the soil layers at 0 2 and 0 3 m depths showed very similar mean soil moisture values in year 1 while a 0 01 m3 m 3 difference was observed in year 2 the variance of soil moisture decreased with soil depth in both years although larger cv and sd values occurred in year 2 suggesting that higher soil moisture variability occurred during the drier year the minimum and maximum mean daily soil moisture values were lower for every depth in year 2 than in year 1 as it was expected the near surface layer dried out the most with soil moisture levels dropping from 0 431 to 0 233 m3 m 3 in year 1 and from 0 458 to 0 201 m3 m 3 in year 2 table 2 in terms of kurtosis platykurtic behaviour was observed for both years although year 2 was assessed to be closer to normal distribution than year 1 the interquartile ranges at the 0 1 and 0 3 m soil depths showed similar values whereas the 0 1 m soil depth measurements were the wettest except for the 25 percentile the difference between year 1 and year 2 is also represented by the shape of the density curves in general the negative skewness was more apparent in year 1 and the skewness values of year 2 were closer to zero suggesting a more symmetric data distribution interestingly some studies reported normal distribution for surface soil moisture nielsen biggar and erh 1973 such as on a northeast facing slope in spain and positively skewed distributions were also observed by charpentier and groffman 1992 in a valley on flat and sloping land in kansas according to famiglietti et al 1999 and vereecken et al 2014 flat surfaces can often be characterised by normally distributed soil moisture probability density functions due to the less variable soil physical and hydraulic properties on the other hand the distribution of soil moisture on terrains with significant relief does not necessarily follow a normal pattern i e it may be better described by non normal distributions vereecken et al 2014 noted that the normality of the probability density function of soil moisture is not an essential requirement for the application of geostatistical tools in complex terrain the lateral redistribution has an increased importance as it was shown by western bl√∂schl and grayson 1998 during wet conditions the most significant predictor for spatial soil moisture distribution was found to be the upslope contributing or specific area whereas in dry conditions aspect was the best predictor for soil moisture spatial patterns famiglietti et al 1998 western et al 1999 towards the deeper sections in the soil profile the density curves had very similar shape for year 1 and year 2 fig 6 showed characteristic peaks occurring around certain soil moisture levels for example at 0 35 m3 m 3 at 0 2 m depth and 0 42 m3 m 3 at 0 4 m depth that can indicate that the spatial soil moisture patterns have a certain temporal stability at deeper soil depths therefore temporal stability of the spatial patterns will be further investigated in the following sections 3 3 spatial variability and temporal dynamics the spatial mean sd and cv were computed on a daily basis allowing the examination of spatial patterns in terms of temporal stability and the comparison to other studies peng et al 2016 fig 7 shows the daily spatial mean soil moisture time series for each depth along with daily rainfall the spatial mean varied synchronously in all soil depths showing apparent response of soil moisture to precipitation events the soil moisture curves revealed the more dynamic nature of the topmost soil layer compared to the deeper layers due to the interaction with meteorological forcing this also indicates decreasing temporal variability and increasing temporal stability with depth the temporal occurrence of crossovers i e when the soil moisture at 0 1 m drops below soil moisture at the 0 4 m depth mark important dates for farm practices such as drainage management crossover events occurred 3 times during these 2 years i e on 22 12 2016 07 11 2017 and 25 10 2018 represented by dashed lines in fig 8 this annual sequential shift from december to the end of october suggest that multi depth soil moisture trends can be used a proxy to detect long term changes in rewetting and drying periods soil moisture values decreased continuously from the 8 nov 2016 until mid january 2017 when the driest day occurred in year 1 from mid january the spatial mean increased until mid may 2017 when most node locations reached field capacity or near saturation levels the near saturated state was maintained until the 8 oct 2017 when another drying cycle started the water stored in the soil was lost considerably faster at the end of year 1 reaching low soil water levels in early december 2017 during year 2 summer season the research area did not receive significant amount of rainfall a total of 172 mm compared to the 207 mm in year 1 although evaporation rates were higher due to the elevated air and soil temperature the summer low and the lowest soil moisture content during the two year long recording time was reached on the 9 feb 2018 the dry season lasted longer in year 2 than in year 1 and following year 2 s dry season the rewetting process in year 2 was not as rapid as in year 1 resulting in near saturation conditions occurring in june 2018 as opposed to may in 2017 this wet stage lasted until early september 2018 the range of temporal soil moisture change was the largest at the 0 1 m depth reaching 0 27 m3 m 3 with a minimum occurring on the 18 feb 2018 and maximum on the 13 july 2017 the range decreased with depth reducing to 0 21 m3 m 3 at 0 2 m 0 172 m3 m 3 at 0 3 m and 0 14 m3 m 3 at 0 4 m depth as the near surface layer is exposed to the largest effects of atmospheric forcing the sd and the cv showed the largest changes depicting more time variance in the spatial pattern behaviour than deeper parts of the profile the temporal stability of the spatial variability in the deeper soil were more pronounced as indicated by the lower sd and cv than in the 0 1 m soil layer the cv and sd were highest in the dry seasons jan feb 2017 and dec 2017 march 2018 and the wetting periods in autumn mar apr 2017 and mar may 2018 in both years the variability decreased noticeably through the wet stages when soil moisture levels increased to 0 26 0 29 m3 m 3 at 0 1 m soil depth and reached its minimum at the end of the wet seasons similar findings were reported by korres et al 2015 on various spatial scales in western germany based on nine different datasets during a two year period as well as by percy et al 2020 on planar hillslopes in this study the minimum cv values were associated with soil conditions just below saturation point fig 7 that was also found by harter and zhang 1999 and owe jones and schmugge 1982 in heterogeneous soils in south dakota usa several other studies found that spatial variability decreased with increasing soil moisture content famiglietti et al 1999 hu et al 2011 korres et al 2013 resonating well with our observations the cv and sd parameters showed increasing trends during the transition from wet to dry stage although the values were usually lower than changing from dry to wet state the differences in cv and sd among sub periods were the largest in the 0 1 m depth and less significant towards the deeper layers while the cv line is relatively smooth for the 0 1 m layer heavy rainfall events often caused large peaks in cv and sd in the deeper horizons 3 4 time stability analysis fig 8 shows the nodes ranked by mrd values with error bars indicating sdrd to assess soil moisture variability time stability and bias at every node compared to the spatial mean represented by the green line the results are provided for each soil depth as well as for the monitored soil profile mean the node with the lowest mrdand sdrd values is generally considered the most time stable location and the most representative of the spatial mean this method is efficiently used for identification of sampling locations that systematically show overestimation or underestimation of the field mean soil moisture it is apparent that some nodes were consistently wetter while others consistently drier than the mean value this mainly relates to the soil textural properties determining soil water holding capacity the topographic position of the node including aspect and steepness fig 9 suggests that during the experiment the temporal stabilities were not entirely consistent through the soil profile negative mrd values were found at each soil depth for four nodes on the north aspects node 5 8 13 and 20 two nodes on the west node 11 and east facing node 18 steep slopes on a flat node 6 and on an undulating south facing surface node 9 although their rank slightly changed along the soil profile their time stability can be considered moderate positive mrd values occurred at node 19 on a rolling slope with north aspect at a rolling node 16 and a strongly rolling node 7 west facing stations at locations on south aspect with rolling node 1 and moderately steep node 14 slopes at two east facing nodes on strongly rolling node 3 and moderately steep node 4 slopes and at two nodes situated on flat areas node 2 and 15 according to their rank and position most of these locations would considerably overestimate the field mean soil moisture value although their ranks were not consistent with soil depth overall node 7 and 8 showed temporal stability and represent the driest and wettest water content and within the ptsmn in terms of sdrd the 0 1 m and 0 2 m soil depths demonstrated the greatest values as expected due to higher sensitivity to the changes in the climatic parameters while smaller sdrd values were represented by the 0 3 and 0 4 m soil depths indicating significantly less variation sdrd values exhibited similar magnitude which suggest the ptmsn is a temporally stable network although the degree of stability changes with depth 3 5 access to the ptsmn dataset and the use of data the described ptsmn data has been hosted by ismn and made globally available dorigo et al 2021 individuals and organisations can freely retrieve the data from the ismn database through an online interface https ismn earth en last access 29 august 2022 the ptsmn dataset was visually and statistically examined pre processed harmonised and quality checked for publishing via the wider ismn database which makes ptsmn comparable with 71 other soil moisture networks and 2822 monitoring stations across the globe the occurring data gaps are flagged but not filled the completeness of the dataset is approximately 98 due to connection and battery recharging problems mainly during the wintertime at this stage 2 years of data is available between nov 2016 and nov 2018 on an hourly basis through the ismn further datasets will be potentially uploaded subject to sufficient funding and network maintenance here we share the download requests statistics that was provided by the ismn fig 9 downloads per country are summarised in table 3 while downloads per continent and per geo societal benefit are presented in fig 9 in total 495 download requests were received between 1 jan 2020 and 30 june 2021 additionally an increasing interest was indicated by the download statistics year by year not shown in table 3 4 conclusions we deployed a wsn that is capable of monitoring soil moisture at the field scale on a hill country pastoral system providing information about the spatial and temporal variability of soil wetness in the top 0 43 m soil layer this study revealed that soil moisture distribution can be characterised with non normality on these complex terrains year 1 and year 2 showed similarly shaped kernel density curves in the 0 2 0 4 m soil depths indicating temporal stability in the distribution year 2 the drier part of the data collection period represented larger soil moisture variability than year 1 although the value and range of cv and sd of soil moisture decreased with soil depth in both years the range of soil moisture readings were the largest in the 0 1 m soil depth while the spread became narrower with increasing soil depth we found that cv of soil moisture was the lowest when the soils were near saturation or above field capacity showing negligible spatial variability and highest in the descending and ascending transition stages i e drying and rewetting periods temporal stability analysis revealed that node 7 situated on a west facing strongly rolling slope is the wettest node while node 8 located on a steep north facing surface represented the driest conditions within the ptsmn the lowest mrd value indicates that node 12 can be among the most representative locations although the definite selection of the most representative location of ptsmn would require a more detailed temporal stability analysis which will be discussed in a future paper these findings can help farmer managers to understand how topographical positions drive soil moisture variability which directly has an impact on feed availability in hill country pastoral systems the wsn operated mostly perfectly during the study period although we have experienced some weaknesses regarding the power support at the gateway and certain sensor nodes during the wintertime this issue has been partly attributed to the recharging performance of the solar panels on valley bottoms and south facing slope as well as the shadows produced by the high relief landscape this could be avoided by including shadow detection and the assessment of incoming solar radiation over the seasons as part of the wsn planning procedure using a dsm additionally some of the sensor nodes located 3 5 4 km line of sight from each other could establish data transmission these findings should be taken into account if these devices are installed either on flat or hilly terrain which may improve the versatility and flexibility of future networks including localisation and sensor node optimization for representative soil moisture monitoring soil water dynamics in hill country have not been studied extensively and the available soil moisture information is highly limited in new zealand ptsmn is the first of its kind network in new zealand s hill country providing valuable information for researchers to support earth observation land surface model validation and training remote sensing applications yield modelling and the understanding of soil moisture variability in hilly landscapes on the other hand based on the amount of download requests ptsmn is a valuable member of the ismn and there is need for sharing soil moisture datasets with the research community a wide range of research areas have been using the soil specifically calibrated ptsmn dataset globally we expect that this paper will significantly increase the ptsmn dataset visibility and will provide useful details for current and future data users the long term future of ismn has been recently secured and will be operated by the german ministry of transport and digital infrastructure this means that by the support of ismn our understanding of soil moisture dynamics and its relation to topography or environmental processes can be further improved globally as well as in new zealand

9227,to supply water to crop in a proper way by using subsurface negative pressure irrigation npi the distribution of soil moisture around the emitter with different water supply pressure n1 2 kpa n2 4 kpa n3 6 kpa was investigated with surface irrigation as control ck to discuss the match degree of soil moisture to root distribution of chinese chives planted at different distance apart from the npi emitter in the first growth season fg it took more than 15 days to form the stable wetting body of npi due to the very low initial soil moisture as a result the soil moisture and soil water storage w in npi was lower than ck in the second growth season sg the wetting body of npi is almost invariable along time and the soil moisture was much higher in npi system with n1 significantly larger than ck the yield showed a significant positive relation with soil moisture and w in both growth period r was 0 942 and 0 849 respectively as a result the yield in npi was significantly lower than ck in the fg and the yield in n1 was much higher than ck in the sg p 0 05 iwue in npi was significantly lower than ck in the fg while significantly larger than ck in the sg p 0 05 at the same water supply pressure the soil moisture content was larger near the emitter resulting better crop growth p 0 05 from the perspective of long term irrigation npi could obtain a better yield and iwue with less irrigation water amount p 0 05 the water supply pressure of 2 kpa was more feasible to supply water for 6 lines of chinese chives with the same yield to ck and much higher iwue p 0 05 the results indicated that planting crops in regions with proper soil moisture contents within the unique wetting body of npi maintained high crop yield and improved crop iwue thus it is feasible to supply water for multiple rows of dense planted crops of chinese chives with one linear emitter of the npi subsurface system keywords soil moisture distribution yield irrigation water use efficiency crop growth performance wetting body data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water consumption was tripled over the last 50 years due to global warming population increasing and urbanization currently nearly 80 of the global population and 65 of continents suffer from water scarcity voeroesmarty et al 2010 water stress has become an inevitable obstacle to global sustainable development trenberth and asrar 2014 in china agriculture accounts for 62 of the national water use among which more than 90 was used for irrigation chen et al 2022 improving water use efficiency by developing new irrigation techniques is vital important to alleviate water scarcity negative pressure irrigation npi is an effective water saving irrigation technique which supply water to soil automatically and continuously with the water potential gradients between soil and emitter as the driver force bian et al 2018 long et al 2018 nalliah and ranjan 2010 yang et al 2022a 2020 it was proved that npi has the potential to reduce evaporative water loss from soil surface reduce runoff and maintain a stable soil moisture as compared to other irrigation methods wang et al 2019 studies showed that the soil moisture varied along distance from npi emitter and was affected by water supply pressure permeability parameters and buried depth of emitter wang et al 2019 xu et al 2021 zhang et al 2021b researches have done with different emitters and crops table s1 in earlier stage disc emitters made of ceramic or acrylic in different size was used to irrigate a single or two plants li et al 2021 nalliah and ranjan 2010 xiao et al 2016 zhang et al 2021a when it comes to crop with large spacing between rows four rows of water supply pipes were set to irrigate one row of watermelon zhang et al 2021a also some researchers engaged a linear emitter to irrigate more than one row of dense planted crops on each side these crops are usually planted with small spacing such as crown daisy brassica chinensis l capsicum annuum l and cherry radish li et al 2017a yang et al 2020 2022b zhu et al 2020 but the plant was near the emitter all those researches indicated that npi can improve crop yield and wue of crops tomatoes peppers cabbage and cucumber crown daisy brassica chinensis l capsicum annuum l and cherry radish under appropriate pressure control and crop planting techniques li et al 2017a 2017b long et al 2018 nalliah and ranjan 2010 wang et al 2019 table s1 the distance between the wetting front of npi and emitter was generally 25 30 cm and occasionally more than 40 cm wang et al 2016 2019 thus it is possible to irrigate multiple rows of crops with one row of emitter which can reduce the cost for npi instrument and make full use of the unique wetting body characteristics of the npi yet the soil moisture was different among sites with different distance from the npi emitter the soil moisture availability for shallow rooted crops may differ at different distance from the emitter therefore it is of great significance to examine the matching degree of water requirements of crops planted at different distances apart from the npi line emitter chinese chives allium tuberosum rottler ex sprengel which is densely seeded crop with shallow root were planted in four rows within 40 cm at each side of a ceramic line emitter the objectives of this study were to investigate the distribution of soil moisture around the emitter with different negative irrigation pressure and to discuss the match degree of soil moisture to root distribution of chinese chives planted at different distances apart from the line emitter 2 materials and methods 2 1 soil description and experimental design the experiment was carried out in a rain shelter of state key laboratory of hydrology water resources and hydraulic engineering in nanjing 32 06 n 118 77 e from january to june in 2019 soil was collected in 2018 from a plastic greenhouse located at the nanjing vegetables scientific institute in nanjing china soil physical and chemical properties were listed in table 1 in january 2019 soil samples were air dried ground sieved homogenized and finally packed into cylindrical soil columns with a bulk density of 1 35 g cm 3 a self designed npi device was used in this experiment including four parts a water replenishing tank a negative pressure generating unit an electronic control unit and a ceramic emitter and it could achieve automatic pressure regulating fig 1 wang 2022 the experiment was designed with three negative pressure levels at 2 kpa n1 4 kpa n2 and 6 kpa n3 and surface irrigation was set as control ck the experiment was a completely randomized block design with two irrigation treatments and were set in 12 soil boxes l w h 80 40 60 cm for npi and l w h 40 40 60 cm for ck with 3 replications for each treatment for npi treatments the ceramic irrigation emitter 40 cm in length was buried in soil boxes at the depth of 15 cm beneath soil surface and connected to a water chamber through a water pipe fig 1 water was supplied to soil continuously at a low flowrate with npi subsurface system the chinese chives were transplanted at 10 cm of row spacing and 5 cm of plant spacing at both side of the emitter as shown in fig 2 the total amount of irrigation for ck was estimated based on the soil moisture prior to irrigation and field capacity fc during the whole growth period the total irrigation amount was 102 00 90 14 81 10 and 70 63 mm for ck n1 n2 and n3 respectively 60 00 68 75 63 35 and 55 24 mm in the first growth period fg day 0 30 42 00 21 3 17 75 and 15 39 mm in the second growth period sg day 31 55 of chinese chive the soil is divided into 4 different regions from the central to marginal apart from the emitter they were 0 10 cm i 10 20 cm ii 20 30 cm iii and 30 40 cm iv away from the center respectively chinese chives were transplanted on april 15 and harvested twice on may 20 and june 17 2019 n fertilizers of urea were applied to chinese chives at a rate of 450 kg ha 1 for ck treatment urea was dissolved in irrigation water and applied once into the soil in each growth period while it was continuously applied using npi subsurface system at the concentration of 0 75 g urea kg 1 2 2 sampling and analysis soil samples approximately 15 g each were collected every 1 5 days after irrigation using a stainless steel sampler diameter of 8 mm through sampling holes diameter of 10 mm located in one side of each soil box at 5 cm intervals from0 15 cm layers vertically and 0 25 cm horizontally as show in fig 2 all fresh samples were oven dried to determine the soil gravimetric water content 105 12 h soil water storage in 0 15 cm was calculated as 1 w i g i œÅ b sd i 10 2 w i 1 n w i where w i is

segovia cardozo et al 2019 3 iwue 0 1 y i where i is the total irrigation amount mm y is the fresh yield of chinese chive kg ha 1 2 3 statistical analysis analysis of variance anova was performed using the spss 20 0 anova process and duncan s method were used for significance testing the significance level was set at p 0 05 the figures were plotted by surfer 16 0 and origin 2019 3 results 3 1 soil moisture content and soil water storage the temporal dynamics for soil gravimetric water content 0 15 cm under the ck and npi treatments were shown in figs 3 and 4 respectively the main difference between npi and ck is that the soil moisture in ck varies from high 0 221 0 325 g g 1 after irrigation to low 0 020 0 102 g g 1 before next irrigation while soil moisture in npi maintained a stable spatial water distribution after the formation of the wetting body furthermore among subregions for npi treatments soil moisture was decreased along with distance from the emitter to marginal the water supply method had a significant influence on soil water content during the same growth period p 0 05 table 2 in the first growth period fg the average soil moisture content in ck was 0 148 g g 1 which was higher than npi treatments while in the second growth period sg it was lower than n1 but higher than n2 and n3 the lowest soil moisture level lsm at which irrigation should be initiated to avoid water deficit stress and yield reduction was generally taken as 55 75 of fc gao et al 2021 gong et al 2015 hou et al 2015 hu et al 2017 jiao et al 2020 shi 2017 xu et al 2020 in this study 60 of fc was taken as the lsm about 0 135 g g 1 fig 4 showed the variation of the soil moisture contour line of 0 14 g g 1 which was closed to 60 of fc it can be seen that after 15 days of irrigation the soil wetting body of npi was growing and the portion of soil higher than 60 of fc was gradually extending after 15 days the soil wetting body was almost unchanged the soil moisture contour line of 0 14 g g 1 was about 11 13 cm horizontally and 9 12 cm vertically from the emitter on the 10th day after irrigation and 18 24 cm horizontally and 12 13 cm vertically from the emitter on the 15th day and then remained unchanged for regions at different distances from the emitter the average soil moisture content in region i ii and iii was lower than 60 of fc in the fg while the region i and ii under 5 15 cm layer of n1 n2 and n3 was larger than 60 of fc in the sg the results showed that the npi with water supply pressure in the range of 2 kpa 6 kpa was able to meet the water demand of crop in soil within 11 13 cm from the emitter vertically and 18 24 cm from the emitter horizontally mostly in region i and ii as shown in fig 2 3 2 plant growth as expected plant growth was positively affected by soil moisture as indicated by stem diameter leaf width and plant height table 3 the leaf width and plant height of npi treatments was significantly lower than ck in the fg while it was higher under n1 than ck in the sg the stem diameter leaf width and plant height under n1 was higher than that of n2 and n3 during the two growth periods although the difference was not significant for chinese chive planted at different distance from the emitter the stem diameter leaf width and plant height were significantly higher in region i than region iii under the same water supply pressure which was due to the high availability of soil moisture in region i as shown in fig 4 the initial soil moisture content was only 0 04 0 10 g g 1 closed to the wilting point 0 054 g g 1 the crops cannot grow normally in the early stage most of them did not survive from transplanting in region iv 3 3 soil water storage yield and iwue the soil water storage w in ck treatment reached the maximum at the first day after irrigation and then decreased gradually until the second irrigation while in npi the w increased gradually and finally maintained a constant value fig 5 it was 32 78 31 52 and 30 10 mm in top 15 cm soil depths for n1 n2 and n3 respectively w was the largest in n1 and lowest in n3 compared with ck the average w in npi treatment was significantly lower in the fg yet in the sg only the average w in n1 was significantly higher than ck table 4 chinese chives yield varied greatly among irrigation treatments the yield of ck n1 n2 and n3 was 2601 88 2002 22 1277 78 and 1174 44 kg ha 1 respectively in the fg and 2479 38 2441 67 2009 44 and 1762 22 kg ha 1 respectively in the sg of chinese chive table 3 compared to ck the yield of n1 n2 and n3 was decreased by 23 05 50 89 and 54 86 in the fg and by 1 52 18 95 and 28 92 in the sg for treatment with the same water supply pressure of npi the yield of during sg was much higher than that of the fg table 4 iwue is one of the most important indicators for measuring water use by crops it was 4 34 2 92 2 02 and 2 13 kg m 3 for ck n1 n2 and n3 in the fg and 5 90 11 45 11 33 and 11 46 kg m 3 for ck n1 n2 and n3 in the sg the study showed the iwue of npi was lower than ck in the fg but significantly higher than ck in the sg table 4 3 4 relationships between soil moisture soil water storage yield and iwue the correlation coefficients between soil moisture soil water storage yield and iwue during the whole growth periods are shown in table 5 the correlation analysis showed that the yield had a significant positive relationship with soil moisture and w in both growth period table 5 iwue had a significant positive relationship with soil moisture w and yield in the fg but no correlation in the sg table 5 4 discussion 4 1 is npi feasible for dense seeded shallow rooted plant like chinese chives nalliah and ranjan 2010 declared that the higher yield of peppers was obtained in the 2 kpa treatment compared to the 4 kpa and 6 kpa treatments li et al 2017 declared that npi subsurface system also increased tomato yields under appropriate pressures 10 to 0 kpa compared to the traditional irrigation in the cucumber experiment in current research a single line emitter was used to supply water to 8 rows of chinese chive a dense seeded and shallow rooted plant and the match degree of soil moisture in different planting areas was discussed soil moisture and its availability is the primary factor to support plant growth too little moisture can result in yield loss and crop failure jha et al 2017 kiboi et al 2017 in current research the wetting body is completely formed about 15 days after irrigation fig 4 a large volume of water was consumed during the formation of soil wetting body for the extremely low initial soil moisture and the total amount of irrigation water in the fg was large which was similar to ck but the yield was significantly lower than ck table 4 while in the sg the soil moisture in npi remained stable along time and it was larger under n1 than that under ck the yield of npi was significantly larger than that in the fg with the yield in n1 as high as ck thus to discuss whether the soil moisture supplied by npi can meet requirement of chinese chives it is better based on the results in sg during which soil moisture is steady during the sg there was no significant difference in chinese chive yield between ck and n1 treatments table 4 indicating that when the water supply was 2 kpa npi subsurface system was feasible to irrigate multiple rows of dense seeded shallow rooted plant like chinese chives with a line emitter however when the water supply pressure of 4 kpa and 6 kpa the yield of chinese chives was lower than ck table 4 the study also found that the crop growth performances in region i and ii were better than that in region iii table 3 therefore it might be possible to adjust the matching degree of water requirements of crops planted at different distances apart from the npi line emitter so as to improve the chinese chive yield of npi and the irrigation water use efficiency in current study the 60 of fc was taken as the lowest soil moisture level lsm as showed in fig 4 and table 6 the suitable range of n1 n2 and n3 treatments for crop growth was 0 24 0 20 and 0 19 cm horizontally apart from the emitter for n1 treatment the soil moisture content in region i ii and iii was sufficient for crop growth as a result that the yield in n1 treatment of sg was as same as ck treatment table 4 for n2 and n3 treatments although the soil moisture in region i and ii was sufficient for crop growth but soil moisture content in region ii was less than 60 of fc within the range of 0 5 cm from the surface fig 4 and the region iii in n2 and n3 was lower than 60 of fc caused water deficit stress on plant and finally result in a significantly lower crop yield than ck table 4 it is suggested if npi was applied in field more emitters or shorter emitter distance are necessary because it can supply water to a narrow range at both sides of the emitter moreover for all npi treatments it was irrigated with water at the same concentration of 0 75 g urea kg 1 since the water volume was quite different among npi treatments total urea application in sg was 450 160 43 133 13 and 115 43 kg urea ha 1 for ck n1 n2 and n3 and the urea application in npi treatments was significantly lower than ck less urea inputs might take partial responsibility for the lower yields it indicated that nutrients concentrations should be set at a higher level than ck to avoid nutrients deficit caused by less water inputs when crops were irrigated with npi system 4 2 match water supply by terrain designing or interplanting according to soil moisture distribution root is the most important functional organ for plants to capture available water and nutrients from the soil bengough et al 2011 it plays a critical role in the plant soil ecosystem and significantly affect crop growth and grain yield wang et al 2014 zhang et al 2009 based on the results of water distribution and growth of chinese chives fig 4 tables 3 and 4 the adaptive countermeasures were proposed from the perspective of making better use of the water distribution characteristics of npi which could overcome the problem of low crop yield in marginal regions and promote the application of npi subsurface system li et al 2018 xu et al 2016 according the isoline of 60 fc in fig 4 the range within which soil moisture can satisfy crop growth in n1 n2 and n3 treatments is 24 cm 20 cm and 19 cm horizontally from emitter table 6 respectively if planted dense seeded and shallow rooted crops it is advised that the maximum spacing of the emitter for n1 n2 and n3 is set at 48 cm 40 cm and 38 cm when the emitter is buried at a depth of 12 15 cm table 6 in the vertical scope the far the distance from the emitter the high depth of the isoline of 60 of fc to soil surface thus it is suggested that we can plant crops with different root depth at different distance to the npi emitter as show in fig 6a for example we can plant shallow rooted plant like chinese chives within 15 20 cm at both sides and a deep rooted crop at the marginal region of the wetting body or intersection of two adjacent wetting bodies deep rooting crop can take better use of soil moisture in deep soil and do not explore the upper soil layers efficiently lovenstein et al 1991 thus planting deep root crops in marginal regions around emitters and shallow root crops in regions near the emitter is a possible way to realize similar water availability for in different sub regions around the emitter yet water depletion and root water proliferate will inevitably resulted in the redistribution of soil moisture in the wetting body it is necessary to investigate the soil moisture distribution subjected to the npi water supply and non uniform water consumption of shallow root and deep root plants inter cropping system from the wetting body and curve of the isoline of 60 of fc ridge culture was suggested as another adaptation to take the advantage of the npi irrigation designing the surface of the ridge according to the shape of the wetting body to ensure at different region apart from emitter the depth of isoline of 60 of fc to ridge soil surface is similar fig 6b it can match the water demand of crop at marginal region in a much better way and extend the distance suitable for crop growth at both sides of the emitter that is essential to improve the feasibility and efficiency of the npi subsurface system 4 3 adapt planting time according to temporal variation of soil moisture the emitter is made of ceramic with very low permeability and the initial soil moisture 0 014 g g 1 is lower than the wilting point 0 054 g g 1 the wetting body is completely formed about 15 days after irrigation fig 4 resulting a lower yield of chinese chive in the fg and it should adapt planting time according to temporal variation of soil moisture in the subsequent application in the field thus it is very important to match the soil moisture temporally with crop growth in npi subsurface system especially when the permeability of the emitter is very low the first solution is that planted crops till the time when the soil wetting body was formed such as 15 days after the initiate of npi subsurface system the soil moisture content could meet the crop s water requirements for it was more than 60 of fc at the horizontal distance of 15 20 cm from the emitter the second is that the initial water content could raise to 60 of fc and then use a npi device to maintain soil moisture and meet the crop s moisture requirements for vigorous growth the last one using the automatic npi subsurface system which can adjust the pressure automatically to set the water supply pressure at a much higher level even positive one to accelerate the process of wetting body formation this idea also can be applied to match crop water requirement more precisely among different stages with different water stress sensitivity by setting different negative pressure in different stages of the crop in current research the emitter was ceramic it can maintain negative pressure without air leakage but its permeability is very low if the emitter with different permeability was designed either by changing the production craft or with improved material that will affect the formation time of the soil wetting body and distribution of soil moisture some quantitative results will be changed the idea of this research is feasible although efforts will be done to quantifying the spatio temporal distribution of soil moisture and discussing the suitable negative pressure control as well as the appropriate planting

9227,to supply water to crop in a proper way by using subsurface negative pressure irrigation npi the distribution of soil moisture around the emitter with different water supply pressure n1 2 kpa n2 4 kpa n3 6 kpa was investigated with surface irrigation as control ck to discuss the match degree of soil moisture to root distribution of chinese chives planted at different distance apart from the npi emitter in the first growth season fg it took more than 15 days to form the stable wetting body of npi due to the very low initial soil moisture as a result the soil moisture and soil water

larger than ck the yield showed a significant positive relation with soil moisture and w in both growth period r was 0 942 and 0 849 respectively as a result the yield in npi was significantly lower

supply water for multiple rows of dense planted crops of chinese chives with one linear emitter of the npi subsurface system keywords soil moisture distribution yield irrigation water use efficiency crop growth performance wetting body data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water consumption was tripled over the last 50 years due to global warming population increasing and urbanization currently nearly 80 of the global population and 65 of continents suffer from water scarcity voeroesmarty et al 2010 water stress has become an inevitable obstacle to global sustainable development trenberth and asrar 2014 in china agriculture accounts for 62 of the national water use among which more than 90 was used for irrigation chen et al 2022 improving water use efficiency by developing new irrigation techniques is vital important to alleviate water scarcity negative pressure irrigation npi is an effective water saving irrigation technique which supply water to soil automatically and continuously with the water potential gradients between soil and emitter as the driver force bian et al 2018 long et al 2018 nalliah and ranjan 2010 yang et al 2022a 2020 it was proved that npi has the potential to reduce evaporative water loss from soil surface reduce runoff and maintain a stable soil moisture as compared to other irrigation methods wang et al 2019 studies showed that the soil moisture varied along distance from npi emitter and was affected by water supply pressure permeability parameters and buried depth of emitter wang et al 2019 xu et al 2021 zhang et al 2021b researches have done with different emitters and crops table s1 in earlier stage disc emitters made of ceramic or acrylic in different size was used to irrigate a single or two plants li et al 2021 nalliah and ranjan 2010 xiao et al 2016 zhang et al 2021a when it comes to crop with large spacing between rows four rows of water supply pipes were set to irrigate one row of watermelon zhang et al 2021a also some researchers engaged a linear emitter to irrigate more than one row of dense planted crops on each side these crops are usually planted with small spacing such as crown daisy brassica chinensis l capsicum annuum l and cherry radish li et al 2017a yang et al 2020 2022b zhu et al 2020 but the plant was near the emitter all those researches indicated that npi can improve crop yield and wue of crops tomatoes peppers cabbage and cucumber crown daisy brassica chinensis l capsicum annuum l and cherry radish under appropriate pressure control and crop planting techniques li et al 2017a 2017b long et al 2018 nalliah and ranjan 2010 wang et al 2019 table s1 the distance between the wetting front of npi and emitter was generally 25 30 cm and occasionally more than 40 cm wang et al 2016 2019 thus it is possible to irrigate multiple rows of crops with one row of emitter which can reduce the cost for npi instrument and make full use of the unique wetting body characteristics of the npi yet the soil moisture was different among sites with different distance from the npi emitter the soil moisture availability for shallow rooted crops may differ at different distance from the emitter therefore it is of great significance to examine the matching degree of water requirements of crops planted at different distances apart from the npi line emitter chinese chives allium tuberosum rottler ex sprengel which is densely seeded crop with shallow root were planted in four rows within 40 cm at each side of a ceramic line emitter the objectives of this study were to investigate the distribution of soil moisture around the emitter with different negative irrigation pressure and to discuss the match degree of soil moisture to root distribution of chinese chives planted at different distances apart from the line emitter 2 materials and methods 2 1 soil description and experimental design the experiment was carried out in a rain shelter of state key laboratory of hydrology water resources and hydraulic engineering in nanjing 32 06 n 118 77 e from january to june in 2019 soil was collected in 2018 from a plastic greenhouse located at the nanjing vegetables scientific institute in nanjing china soil physical and chemical properties were listed in table 1 in january 2019 soil samples were air dried ground sieved homogenized and finally packed into cylindrical soil columns with a bulk density of 1 35 g cm 3 a self designed npi device was used in this experiment including four parts a water replenishing tank a negative pressure generating unit an electronic control unit and a ceramic emitter and it could achieve automatic pressure regulating fig 1 wang 2022 the experiment was designed with three negative pressure levels at 2 kpa n1 4 kpa n2 and 6 kpa n3 and surface irrigation was set as control ck the experiment was a completely randomized block design with two irrigation treatments and were set in 12 soil boxes l w h 80 40 60 cm for npi and l w h 40 40 60 cm for ck with 3 replications for each treatment for npi treatments the ceramic irrigation emitter 40 cm in length was buried in soil boxes at the depth of 15 cm beneath soil surface and connected to a water chamber through a water pipe fig 1 water was supplied to soil continuously at a low flowrate with npi subsurface system the chinese chives were transplanted at 10 cm of row spacing and 5 cm of plant spacing at both side of the emitter as shown in fig 2 the total amount of irrigation for ck was estimated based on the soil moisture prior to irrigation and field capacity fc during the whole growth period the total irrigation amount was 102 00 90 14 81 10 and 70 63 mm for ck n1 n2 and n3 respectively 60 00 68 75 63 35 and 55 24 mm in the first growth period fg day 0 30 42 00 21 3 17 75 and 15 39 mm in the second growth period sg day 31 55 of chinese chive the soil is divided into 4 different regions from the central to marginal apart from the emitter they were 0 10 cm i 10 20 cm ii 20 30 cm iii and 30 40 cm iv away from the center respectively chinese chives were transplanted on april 15 and harvested twice on may 20 and june 17 2019 n fertilizers of urea were applied to chinese chives at a rate of 450 kg ha 1 for ck treatment urea was dissolved in irrigation water and applied once into the soil in each growth period while it was continuously applied using npi subsurface system at the concentration of 0 75 g urea kg 1 2 2 sampling and analysis soil samples approximately 15 g each were collected every 1 5 days after irrigation using a stainless steel sampler diameter of 8 mm through sampling holes diameter of 10 mm located in one side of each soil box at 5 cm intervals from0 15 cm layers vertically and 0 25 cm horizontally as show in fig 2 all fresh samples were oven dried to determine the soil gravimetric water content 105 12 h soil water storage in 0 15 cm was calculated as 1 w i g i œÅ b sd i 10 2 w i 1 n w i where w i is

using the spss 20 0 anova process and duncan s method were used for significance testing the significance level was set at p 0 05 the figures were plotted by surfer 16 0 and origin 2019 3 results 3 1 soil moisture content and soil water storage the temporal dynamics for soil gravimetric water content 0 15 cm under the ck and npi treatments were shown in figs 3 and 4 respectively the main difference between npi and ck is that the soil moisture in ck varies from high 0 221 0 325 g g 1 after irrigation to low 0 020 0 102 g g 1 before next irrigation while soil moisture in npi maintained a stable spatial water distribution after the formation of the wetting body furthermore among subregions for npi treatments soil moisture was decreased along with distance from the emitter to marginal the water supply method had a significant influence on soil water content during the same growth period p 0 05 table 2 in the first growth period fg the average soil moisture content in ck was 0 148 g g 1 which was higher than npi treatments while in the second growth period sg it was lower than n1 but higher than n2 and n3 the lowest soil moisture level lsm at which irrigation should be initiated to avoid water deficit stress and yield reduction was generally taken as 55 75 of fc gao et al 2021 gong et al 2015 hou et al 2015 hu et al 2017 jiao et al 2020 shi 2017 xu et al 2020 in this study 60 of fc was taken as the lsm about 0 135 g g 1 fig 4 showed the variation of the soil moisture contour line of 0 14 g g 1 which was closed to 60 of fc it can be seen that after 15 days of irrigation the soil wetting body of npi was growing and the portion of soil higher than 60 of fc was gradually extending after 15 days the soil wetting body was almost unchanged the soil moisture contour line of 0 14 g g 1 was about 11 13 cm horizontally and 9 12 cm vertically from the emitter on the 10th day after irrigation and 18 24 cm horizontally and 12 13 cm vertically from the emitter on the 15th day and then remained unchanged for regions at different distances from the emitter the average soil moisture content in region i ii and iii was lower than 60 of fc in the fg while the region i and ii under 5 15 cm layer of n1 n2 and n3 was larger than 60 of fc in the sg the results showed that the npi with water supply pressure in the range of 2 kpa 6 kpa was able to meet the water demand of crop in soil within 11 13 cm from the emitter vertically and 18 24 cm from the emitter horizontally mostly in region i and ii as shown in fig 2 3 2 plant growth as expected plant growth was positively affected by soil moisture as indicated by stem diameter leaf width and plant height table 3 the leaf width and plant height of npi treatments was significantly lower than ck in the fg while it was higher under n1 than ck in the sg the stem diameter leaf width and plant height under n1 was higher than that of n2 and n3 during the two growth periods although the difference was not significant for chinese chive planted at different distance from the emitter the stem diameter leaf width and plant height were significantly higher in region i than region iii under the same water supply pressure which was due to the high availability of soil moisture in region i as shown in fig 4 the initial soil moisture content was only 0 04 0 10 g g 1 closed to the wilting point 0 054 g g 1 the crops cannot grow normally in the early stage most of them did not survive from transplanting in region iv 3 3 soil water storage yield and iwue the soil water storage w in ck treatment reached the maximum at the first day after irrigation and then decreased gradually until the second irrigation while in npi the w increased gradually and finally maintained a constant value fig 5 it was 32 78 31 52 and 30 10 mm in top 15 cm soil depths for n1 n2 and n3 respectively w was the largest in n1 and lowest in n3 compared with ck the average w in npi treatment was significantly lower in the fg yet in the sg only the average w in n1 was significantly higher than ck table 4 chinese chives yield varied greatly among irrigation treatments the yield of ck n1 n2 and n3 was 2601 88 2002 22 1277 78 and 1174 44 kg ha 1 respectively in the fg and 2479 38 2441 67 2009 44 and 1762 22 kg ha 1 respectively in the sg of chinese chive table 3 compared to ck the yield of n1 n2 and n3 was decreased by 23 05 50 89 and 54 86 in the fg and by 1 52 18 95 and 28 92 in the sg for treatment with the same water supply pressure of npi the yield of during sg was much higher than that of the fg table 4 iwue is one of the most important indicators for measuring water use by crops it was 4 34 2 92 2 02 and 2 13 kg m 3 for ck n1 n2 and n3 in the fg and 5 90 11 45 11 33 and 11 46 kg m 3 for ck n1 n2 and n3 in the sg the study showed the iwue of npi was lower than ck in the fg but significantly higher than ck in the sg table 4 3 4 relationships between soil moisture soil water storage yield and iwue the correlation coefficients between soil moisture soil water storage yield and iwue during the whole growth periods are shown in table 5 the correlation analysis showed that the yield had a significant positive relationship with soil moisture and w in both growth period table 5 iwue had a significant positive relationship with soil moisture w and yield in the fg but no correlation in the sg table 5 4 discussion 4 1 is npi feasible for dense seeded shallow rooted plant like chinese chives nalliah and ranjan 2010 declared that the higher yield of peppers was obtained in the 2 kpa treatment compared to the 4 kpa and 6 kpa treatments li et al 2017 declared that npi subsurface system also increased tomato yields under appropriate pressures 10 to 0 kpa compared to the traditional irrigation in the cucumber experiment in current research a single line emitter was used to supply water to 8 rows of chinese chive a dense seeded and shallow rooted plant and the match degree of soil moisture in different planting areas was discussed soil moisture and its availability is the primary factor to support plant growth too little moisture can result in yield loss and crop failure jha et al 2017 kiboi et al 2017 in current research the wetting body is completely formed about 15 days after irrigation fig 4 a large volume of water was consumed during the formation of soil wetting body for the extremely low initial soil moisture and the total amount of irrigation water in the fg was large which was similar to ck but the yield was significantly lower than ck table 4 while in the sg the soil moisture in npi remained stable along time and it was larger under n1 than that under ck the yield of npi was significantly larger than that in the fg with the yield in n1 as high as ck thus to discuss whether the soil moisture supplied by npi can meet requirement of chinese chives it is better based on the results in sg during which soil moisture is steady during the sg there was no significant difference in chinese chive yield between ck and n1 treatments table 4 indicating that when the water supply was 2 kpa npi subsurface system was feasible to irrigate multiple rows of dense seeded shallow rooted plant like chinese chives with a line emitter however when the water supply pressure of 4 kpa and 6 kpa the yield of chinese chives was lower than ck table 4 the study also found that the crop growth performances in region i and ii were better than that in region iii table 3 therefore it might be possible to adjust the matching degree of water requirements of crops planted at different distances apart from the npi line emitter so as to improve the chinese chive yield of npi and the irrigation water use efficiency in current study the 60 of fc was taken as the lowest soil moisture level lsm as showed in fig 4 and table 6 the suitable range of n1 n2 and n3 treatments for crop growth was 0 24 0 20 and 0 19 cm horizontally apart from the emitter for n1 treatment the soil moisture content in region i ii and iii was sufficient for crop growth as a result that the yield in n1 treatment of sg was as same as ck treatment table 4 for n2 and n3 treatments although the soil moisture in region i and ii was sufficient for crop growth but soil moisture content in region ii was less than 60 of fc within the range of 0 5 cm from the surface fig 4 and the region iii in n2 and n3 was lower than 60 of fc caused water deficit stress on plant and finally result in a significantly lower crop yield than ck table 4 it is suggested if npi was applied in field more emitters or shorter emitter distance are necessary because it can supply water to a narrow range at both sides of the emitter moreover for all npi treatments it was irrigated with water at the same concentration of 0 75 g urea kg 1 since the water volume was quite different among npi treatments total urea application in sg was 450 160 43 133 13 and 115 43 kg urea ha 1 for ck n1 n2 and n3 and the urea application in npi treatments was significantly lower than ck less urea inputs might take partial responsibility for the lower yields it indicated that nutrients concentrations should be set at a higher level than ck to avoid nutrients deficit caused by less water inputs when crops were irrigated with npi system 4 2 match water supply by terrain designing or interplanting according to soil moisture distribution root is the most important functional organ for plants to capture available water and nutrients from the soil bengough et al 2011 it plays a critical role in the plant soil ecosystem and significantly affect crop growth and grain yield wang et al 2014 zhang et al 2009 based on the results of water distribution and growth of chinese chives fig 4 tables 3 and 4 the adaptive countermeasures were proposed from the perspective of making better use of the water distribution characteristics of npi which could overcome the problem of low crop yield in marginal regions and promote the application of npi subsurface system li et al 2018 xu et al 2016 according the isoline of 60 fc in fig 4 the range within which soil moisture can satisfy crop growth in n1 n2 and n3 treatments is 24 cm 20 cm and 19 cm horizontally from emitter table 6 respectively if planted dense seeded and shallow rooted crops it is advised that the maximum spacing of the emitter for n1 n2 and n3 is set at 48 cm 40 cm and 38 cm when the emitter is buried at a depth of 12 15 cm table 6 in the vertical scope the far the distance from the emitter the high depth of the isoline of 60 of fc to soil surface thus it is suggested that we can plant crops with different root depth at different distance to the npi emitter as show in fig 6a for example we can plant shallow rooted plant like chinese chives within 15 20 cm at both sides and a deep rooted crop at the marginal region of the wetting body or intersection of two adjacent wetting bodies deep rooting crop can take better use of soil moisture in deep soil and do not explore the upper soil layers efficiently lovenstein et al 1991 thus planting deep root crops in marginal regions around emitters and shallow root crops in regions near the emitter is a possible way to realize similar water availability for in different sub regions around the emitter yet water depletion and root water proliferate will inevitably resulted in the redistribution of soil moisture in the wetting body it is necessary to investigate the soil moisture distribution subjected to the npi water supply and non uniform water consumption of shallow root and deep root plants inter cropping system from the wetting body and curve of the isoline of 60 of fc ridge culture was suggested as another adaptation to take the advantage of the npi irrigation designing the surface of the ridge according to the shape of the wetting body to ensure at different region apart from emitter the depth of isoline of 60 of fc to ridge soil surface is similar fig 6b it can match the water demand of crop at marginal region in a much better way and extend the distance suitable for crop growth at both sides of the emitter that is essential to improve the feasibility and efficiency of the npi subsurface system 4 3

2016 2017a 2017b oil palm required large amount of nutrients to sustain high yield ng 1977 pushparajah and chew 1998 henson 1999 patrick et al 1999 the manuring cost for the mature palm was high where fertilizer accounts for more than 30 of the total cost of palm oil production and about 60 of the total upkeep cost of mature planting teo et al 2000 fertilizer inputs therefore constitute an important investment in oil palm plantations to optimize returns fertilizers must be utilized efficiency and judiciously oil palms have been growing in many parts of the world but mainly in south east asia malaysia and indonesia the uneven rainfall distribution particularly in the interior part of the country is amongst the major contributory factors affecting high oil palm yields goh et al 2002 mathews et al 2006 in this traditional growing region the annual rainfall may vary from a well distributed 2000 mm to a seasonal deficit of less than 1500 mm which may be compensated by irrigation periodic dry periods in january march and june august commonly occur in the inland areas of the peninsular nieuwolt et al 1982 kee 1995 even in the wet tropics water availability for the oil palm during dry periods can be limited creating stress and a wide range of negative effects on productivity the most important factor limiting high oil palm yields is moisture stress in general oil palm requires an adequate year round supply of moisture to develop its full yield potential and the ideal rainfall regime is probably between 2500 and 3500 mm per year or at least 120 mm per month von uexkull and fairhurst 1991 long drought or prolonged water stress has severe effect on the growth development and production of oil palm prolonged water stress can delay frond development and depress female inflorescence formation and increase male inflorescence von uexkull and fairhurst 1991 foong 1999 extended drought can cause abortion of inflorescence broekmans 1957 in some cases water stress can reduce the oil content of the mesocarp and prevented certain bunches from ripening completely ochs and daniel 1976 in view of moisture stress having a strong influence on oil palm growth and development irrigation was carried out by felda agricultural services sdn bhd fassb to study the yield response of oil palm to irrigation irrigation had shown to increase fresh fruit bunch ffb yield by 5 17 due to increase bunch number because of reduced abortion corley and hong 1982 in contrast when irrigation was implemented in the dry areas yield increase of 13 17 tons ffb ha year over that of the non irrigated palms was achieved the irrigated palms could yield up to 36 tons ffb ha year foong 1999 to obtain such high yields high rates of fertilizer are required normally oil palms are considered to have larger requirements for major mineral nutrients than other tree crops for growth and yield shorrocks 1965 ng and thamboo 1967 ng et al 1968 tan 1976 i t is well known that the fertility status of malaysian soils is generally poor therefore higher fertilizer input is required for high yields ng and thong 1985 von uexkull and fairhurst 1991 as cited in teo et al 1998 preliminary work by aya and ojuederie 1976 on interaction between irrigation and fertilizer has shown the application of fertilizer n and k had an earlier effect on palm height than on leaf number but its effect on bunch yield was rather inconsistent from year to year on the other hand kee and chew 1991 also reported that nk fertilizer application at the rate of 1 5 kg n palm year and 4 2 kg k2o palm year increased the mean ffb yield by 34 for both the irrigated and non irrigated palms under monsoonal climate and there was no interaction between irrigation and fertilizer treatments in the absence of irrigation substantially higher fertilizer rates were required to achieve the same yield as the irrigated palms previous study showed that irrigation can improve yield in contrast current fertilizer recommendation of oil palm is based on its normal potential yield this method of fertilizer recommendation is only suitable for generalized areas and this is not the best for specific areas with very high yielding potential this study was designed to determine the correct fertilizer rates for the irrigated palms to attain high sustainable yield and good profit through the proper utilization of fertilizers therefore the objectives of this study were i to determine the optimal rates of npk fertilizers for irrigated palms ii to evaluate the physiological responses of oil palms to npk fertilizer under irrigation condition and iii to determine the yield potential and best fertilizer input under irrigation condition 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental plot and design this study was carried out in ladang felda tembangau 9 latitude 03 00 59 5 n longitude 102 28 48 5 e pahang and the location of fassb tembangau 9 estate close to the bahau negeri sembilan and triang towns the planting of tekam tenera d p yangambi sc3 materials were commenced in march 2000 the soil types of this area comprise of the gong chenak series aquic kandiudults soil survey staff 2010 with clay moderately deep to deep gently undulating terrain somewhat poorly drained and moderately eroded the terrain in fassb tembangau 9 estate is undulating thus soil erosion is only a minor problem in the estate the experimental design for this trial was a 33 npk factorial rcbd trial with thirty two sample palms fig 1 plot size was 6 6 36 palms with the inner 4 4 16 palms serving as the core recording palms for bunch components bunch weight and number ffb yield t ha vegetative measurements and tissue sampling analysis the rainfall data was also collected throughout of this study period 2 2 fertilizer treatment three fertilizer rates were used for each element they were i 0 0 84 and 1 68 kg n palm yr ii 0 0 68 and 1 36 kg p2o5 palm yr and iii 0 2 4 and 4 8 kg k2o palm yr the sources of fertilizer were ammonium sulphate 21 n and 24 s for n christmas island phosphate rock cipr 34 p2o5 for p and muriate of potash mop 60 k2o for k ammonium sulphate is preferable to urea for inland soil in the inclusion of mop fertilizer rosman and foong 2000 azmi et al 2000 the combination of fertilizer treatments used for this experiment were 27 table 1 and with two replications giving 54 of total plots this experimental set up utilized about 14 5 ha 2 3 soil at the trial site 2 3 1 soil sampling and preparation soil sampling was carried at the initial stage of the experiment at each examination point the soil was examined using a jarret soil auger and the soils examined to a depth of 45 cm at each observation point the depth the color mottling texture consistence presence of rock fragments and roots were described using the terminology of the fao s guidelines for soil description food and agriculture organization 1977 and the malaysian standards terminology for soil description paramanathan 1997 four samples 200 g are taken at 0 15 and 15 45 cm depth from in situ soil these samples are separated so that the nutritional status of each zone can be compared soil samples are air dried and prepared for chemical analysis 2 3 2 soil analyses soil was characterized for their nutritional values using standard chemical analytical methods briefly particle size determination of soils was done using the pipette method gee and bauder 1986 the soil ph was measured in the suspensions of h2o soil solution ratio of 1 2 5 using a ph meter metrohm 827 riverview fl usa total c and n in soil were measured using a truspec cns analyzer leco saint joseph mi usa exchangeable cations potassium k magnesium mg calcium ca and cation exchange capacity cec of soil were determined using a leaching method with 1 m ammonium acetate solution at ph 7 00 sumner and miller 1996 and cations in solution were measured by atomic absorption spectrophotometer aas perkin elmer aanalyst 100 atomic absorption spectrometry waltham ma usa total p was extracted using an aqua regia reagent 0 5 g of soil 1 0 ml of concentrated hno3 and digested in a block digester for 15 min at

1962 using a spectrophotometer uv 1700 pharmaspec simadzu instruments japan at 882 nm all the chemicals used in this study were analytical grade having the purity of 99 9 from sigma aldrich chemie gmbh munich germany 2 4 development of irrigation system the flatbed system was used to irrigate the palm flatbeds were constructed in alternate palm rows for the non terraced area lee and romzi 2000 flatbed size was 1 5 m width 0 5 m depth the connecting drain between two adjacent flatbeds along the same inter row area was 0 2 m width 0 2 m depth 1 5 m length fig 2 irrigation was carried out to meet the evapotranspiration demand of 5 0 6 0 mm day this value was used to avoid the variation of the moisture during drought and wet seasons as observed in large areas in khazakstan farooq et al 2022 and in iran valipour 2017 the water from nearby river was pumped on to the flatbed with frequency of irrigation of about one in every 5 days the average amount of water delivered per irrigation session was about 2000 liters per palm this is equivalent to the water reception of 285 liters palm year the overview of the development of the irrigation system is presented in fig 3 2 5 fertilizer application for the first three years after planting the fertilizer rates were given to meet the early growth and production table 2 fertilizer placement for the palms was spread evenly in a band 1 5 1 8 m away from the palm base the fertilizer rates were apportioned equally into three rounds for a year the n p and k fertilizers were mixed into the same application according to the rate of the treatments the npk mixture fertilizers been spread evenly and properly to cover the circle area five split fertilizer applications were applied for a year including kieserite round 4 and boron round 5 in each application round a balanced ratio of nutrients was being applied to the palms therefore the law of the most limiting nutrient for liebig s law will not come to play and result in fertilizer wastage the factorial experiment treatment was started from fourth year 2003 and all measurements were performed from this date 2 6 oil palm foliar sampling 2 6 1 foliar sampling and sample preparation oil palm leaves and rachis were sampled from each recording palms from each treatment the samples were then composite and then often sub sampled in the laboratory prior to drying and preparation for analysis the appropriate frond was correctly sampled frond number 17 was located by counting from the first fully open frond in the center of the crown frond no 1 and removed with a sickle the frond was cut into three approximately equal sections in the middle section locate the bone on the frond and six leaflets on the right of this bone were selected and removed from each frond three leaflets were cut from each side at this section of the frond the leaflets were cleaned with a moist cloth and after removing the laminae from the leaflets they were subsequently cut into the middle 15 20 cm and the other sections discard later they were cut into pieces of about 2 cm lengths and placed in a labeled paper bag rachis sample was chosen from the same location on the frond where leaflet samples were collected a 15 cm length sample was cut into small slices approximately 1 cm thick to facilitate drying all the rachis samples from one plot were bulked in one bag they were then dried at 80 c for twelve hours the samples were then ground to pass through 1 mm sieve and kept in labeled plastic bags 2 6 2 foliar tissues analysis before analysis samples were dried at 105 5 c for 2 hrs and cool in a desiccator the dried samples were analyzed for nitrogen n phosphorus p potassium k magnesium mg following the methodology set out in the malaysian standards sirim 1980 briefly 2 00 g of sample was ashed at 500 10 c for 5 h in a porcelain crucible the ashes samples were digested with 5 ml 20 hcl on heated sand bath for 15 min the solution then transferred in 50 ml volumetric flask and diluted to the volume with deionized water and mix well the solution was analyzed for p and b using an auto analyzer aa skalar san sa3000 aa breda netherland k and mg using an atomic

switzerland based on reaction between ammonium ions with alkaline phenol and hypochlorite to form a blue complex indophenol that closely related to ammonium concentration 2 7 vegetative growth measurement plant health and vegetative were recorded on yearly basis a week before start the experiment the first leaf was tagged during transplanting to count the frond production after a year vegetative measurement including i frond production frond number 1 was marked at the beginning stage of the palm vegetative period using paint measurement of subsequent frond production data is calculated by calculating the number 1 frond up to the paint markers marked on the previous 6 months which were formerly fronds 1 then the new number 1 frond is marked with a different color painted than before number of frond production was recorded into vegetative forms ii frond length measurement was made using a measuring tape in parallel manner from leaflet with vestigial laminae on fronds number 17 to the tip of v shape area in cm iii width and thickness of the petiole the thickness and width of the petiole were measured vertically using the vernier calipers at the leaflet with vestigial laminae area in cm iv the width and thickness of the petiole were used to calculate the petiole cross section pcs which related to the frond dry weight count using the following equation pcs

destructive leaf data was obtained from the readings of length and wide of leaflet using the equation leaf area la total leaflet number leaflet length leaflet width 0 51 2 8 fresh fruit bunch yield and bunch components fresh fruit bunches ffb were harvested at 15 days cycles the ffb yields and the yields components bunch number and bunch weight were recorded during the first 7 years of treatment from 2006 to 2012 field upkeeps and palms maintenance were carried out according to the normal estate practices 2 9 statistical analysis data were averaged over the replications for all measuring dates and their means were used in deriving relationships between vegetative growth foliar analysis and yield parameters the differences in palm growth leaf nutrient analysis and ffb yield analysis between the npk treatments were calculated using the sas 9 4 statistical procedure sas 2002 the tukey s honestly significant difference hsd all pairwise comparison test was used to detect statistical differences among the means at p 0 05 significance level 3 results and discussion 3 1 rainfall distribution the rainfall and number of rain day data for fassb tembangau 9 estate for the 10 year period 2005 2012 showed that the total annual rainfall for the period ranges from 1538 mm to 2233 mm fig 4 a three to four dry months 150 mm occurs in this estate the total annual rain day ranges from 75 to 122 days the seven year means for fassb tembangau 9 estate corresponded to 1872 mm and 103 days this area has a moderate rainfall with a pronounced dry period of 3 4 months in a year a period of low rainfall is generally considered a good criterion for oil palm as it helps to increase in the sunshine hours subsequently increased photosynthesis rate and help improve yields in contrast a period of low rainfall can cause moisture deficient resulting in lower yields thus the climate in the study area is well suited for oil palm cultivation but irrigation can improve yields due to better photosynthesis in the dry season if moisture is available 3 2 physico chemical characteristics of soil the parent materials of this study site consist mainly of sub recent riverine alluvium the unit of mapping currently used is the soil series and is identified based on the soils of malaysia paramananthan 2000a 2010b the keys to the identification of malaysian soils according to parent materials paramananthan 2000a 2010b the soils developed over sub recent alluvium occur on undulating 4 12 or 2 6 slopes terrain in this study area namely gong chenak series aquic kandiudults soil survey staff 2010 the soils are a deep somewhat imperfect to imperfectly drained soils with brownish yellow to yellow upper subsoils at depths below 50 cm the color changes to light gray indicating the presence of a fluctuating water table these areas may be flooded for a few days after periods of heavy rains due to the clayey soil texture table 3 most of these areas have been drained and planted these soils have a clay content of 48 in the surface and increases to 73 with depth table 3 silt and sand contents were low in the range of 12 33 and 12 29 respectively fine sand dominates the sand fraction these soils were acidic with a ph range of 4 5 4 7 the organic c contents and total n values were low and decrease with depth total p 324 Œºp g soil and plant available p 11 0 Œºp g soil were also low the exchangeable cations are low and dominated by ca the cation exchange capacity values and base saturation values were low hence the soil is considering having a low in fertility status 3 3 foliar and rachis nutrient contents there were increased in n p and k foliar status following the application of fertilizer n table 4 however foliar n status of n1 and n2 were almost similar treatment without n fertilizer n0 showed an inadequate foliar nutrient status at 2 41 and below foliar n critical level 2 65 for oil palm at this age this clearly observed by the size of oil palm foliar fig 5 the average value obtained in n1 and n2 are slightly lower than 2 79 n reported by lee et al 2011 on the same genotype used in the present study but under different type of soil and location with additional p rate of application there was no increase in n and k foliar nutrient status except for p nutrient status and at normal level addition of k fertilizer did not result in any significant difference on p and k foliar nutrient status and still at the normal level for p foliar status but at below normal level for k foliar status consequently n deficiency symptom was observed in the entire treatment plot without n fertilizer control plot the appearance of nutrient deficiency symptom in foliar following fertilizer addition differed significantly among nutrients the symptom was observed at different time where n and k in year 2006 tables 4 and 6 and p 2008 table 5 the significant effect of n fertilizer was observed on n and k foliar nutrient status by year 2010 and on p foliar status one year earlier in 2009 on yearly basis the was no significant effect of p fertilizer on p and k foliar nutrient status up to year 2010 except for after 2011 onward and on n in 2009 onwards in contrast effect of k fertilizer showed a similar k status throughout the study period with k value below the standard of 0 9 1 2 k foliar status for a similar age of oil palm the average observed value was 33 4 lower than that on the same genotype on different soil and location at 1 10 k lee et al 2011 oil palms generally respond to higher k levels when n fertilizer is sufficient and n sources can affect k absorption there were clear responses of n and p treatment effect on p rachis but not for k rachis status however effect of k fertilizer treatment showed a significant difference on k rachis nutrient status table 7 fertilizer k application had significantly increased the k content from 1 44 in control plot to about 1 60 for fertilizer rates 1 or 2 during the study period average of 7 years this k value was like the k in rachis 1 59 for comparable oil palm genotype yangambi sc3 planted on undulating soil laid out on in 1999 at the tun razak centre for agricultural services jerantut pahang malaysia lee et al 2014 these results revealed that p and k contents in rachis retained at very high level over the time and indirectly implied that the inherent p and k status in rachis of the oil palm are on high side this is to provide support for oil palm growth and to sustain yields for this period of the study with this also it may explain why the leaf p and k contents is also sustained at satisfactory level in their respective control plots 3 4 vegetative growth measurement except for n fertilizer there was no significant difference p 0 05 between rates of p and k on the vegetative parameters measured in this study during 7 years of data recording table 8 in case of n treatment n1 and n2 were almost similar in value this attributed to much lower value of the vegetative growth parameter measured in the beginning of data recording in 2006 significantly only in leaf area and dry weight but then increased to a greater value in the frond length frond dry weight and leaf area after 7 years 2012 consequently on average after 7 years the contribution of fertilizer plots compared to control was 23 for leaf area and 36 for frond dry weight 3 5 leaf nutrient contents in frond 17 nitrogen p and k contents in leaves of frond 17 of oil palm showed that the treatment n0 had significantly lower nutrients content of 0 0955 kg n frond 0 0062 kg p frond and 0 0269 kg k frond in leaves compared to the rest of the treatments n1 and n2 table 9 although n2 showed the highest value but they are similar in contrast fertilizer p and k did not show any significant different on n p and k leaf nutrient contents in contrast for the same genotype yangambi sc3 these values were about 2 2 5 and 1 4 fold greater for the n p and k respectively lee et al 2014 even though both are clayey soil with an almost similar in the amount of clay content 46 has been classified as munchong soil series under the soil taxonomy typic hapludox 3 6 fresh fruit bunch yield and yield components of oil palm though ffb yield increased with the addition of k as compared to control but they were not statistically significant between levels of k table 10 this is attributed to the ability of k used in this study able to raise palm leaf k above the critical response level 1 0 hence this could explain to the lack of yield response to higher k fertilization in comparison to conventional system generally ffb yield at ascending phase year 06 09 yielded over 25 44 ton ha and at prime yielding phase 10 years reduced by 10 to 23 t ha for this kind of soil in this area the drastic yield dropped mainly due to severe dry spell occurred in that period fig 2 in contrast with great effort had been implemented by irrigation system the present fertilizer trial plot during prime age 10 12 was able to sustain yield at 24 9 ton ha for n2 vs 19 70 ton ha n0 which translate to about an additional 28 increases in ffb yield upward ffb yield trend was observed from 16 75 ton ha 2006 and reached up to 29 73 ton ha 2009 and there after dropped to 24 57 ton ha 2010 table 11 for the control treatment at ascending phase over 4 years 2006 2009 yielded at 24 30 ton ha and dropped by almost 16 versus with complete fertilizer treatment at 29 00 ton ha yield for the plot without fertilizer further deteriorated at prime age phase over 3 years 2010 2012 and yield dropped further by 3 20 ton ha 13 to 21 09 ton ha hence it is obviously without fertilizers the ffb yield performance cannot be fully sustained once the fertilizer continues to be supplied then ffb yields showed an improvement to 23 7 in ffb yielded to more than 26 05 ton ha at prime yielding phase those highest yielded plots can reach up to 26 0 ton ha n1p1k2 and n2p2k2 in contrast under almost a similar soil condition and oil palm genotype this ffb yield was about 10 greater than ffb yield by lee et al 2011 2014 at 23 68 ton ha the importance of fertilizers input to sustain oil palm yield is well demonstrated from the above trial those without fertilizer plot n0p0k0 average for over 7 years 2006 2012 only yielded at 22 92 ton ha as compared with complete fertilizer plot at 26 50 ton ha as mentioned above the higher yield was significantly contributed by the application of n fertilizer nitrogen fertilizer significantly improved ffb performance with increasing in bunch weight kg palm and average bunch weight kg bunch fig 6 in this study n losses is at the minimum level due to the efficient use of irrigation system where the added fertilizer is readily soluble and efficiently uptake by the roots of oil palm ultimately produced a higher ffb yield under conventional system the largest losses are emissions of nh3 and leaching of no3 corresponding to 0 1 42 and 1 34 of mineral n applied respectively pardon et al 2016 in addition n losses may occur as n2o nox n2 emissions leaching nh3 volatilization and runoff the most critical conditions for n losses occur during the immature phase when young palms uptake is low and during the mature phase in areas with sparse soil cover or receiving high amounts of fertilizers pardon et al 2016 phosphorus and k fertilizer rate did not show any significant difference between the treatment for all parameter measured table 12 in spite the higher rate of n addition there was no further increasing in bunch weight and ffb yield t ha during this period of this study fig 7 there was no interaction between n p and k fertilizer treatments or in combination to the oil palm growth parameters and ffb yield and components no data present observed in the 7 years period in this study therefore by reducing the slight amount of n p and or k fertilizers by exploiting the synergistic effect of nk is possible to obtaining optimum vegetative growth and at the same time high ffb yield besides that n may also interact with p fertilizer and that together they may interact with other nutrients 4 conclusion nitrogen and p fertilizer responses were observed in foliar and rachis nutrient status on mature palm under the irrigation condition however only n fertilizer responded to vegetative growth and ffb yield through an improvement in average bunch weight and bunch weight per palm the highest ffb yield attained at the level of n1p1k1 and n2p2k2 at 26 70 t ha and 26 50 t ha respectively the absent of n fertilizer lead to a n deficiency symptom a positive response to n fertilizer was probably due to the low n status in inherent soil at higher rate of k allowed for the efficient use of more n resulted in better early vegetative growth and ffb yields a higher amount of k and mg supply in the soil probably translated to no response of p and k fertilizers but the k foliar nutrient status showed a below normal level over a period of seven

requires an adequate year round supply of moisture to develop its full yield potential and the ideal rainfall regime is probably between 2500 and 3500 mm per year or at least 120 mm per month von uexkull and fairhurst 1991 long drought or prolonged water stress has severe effect on the growth development and production of oil palm prolonged water stress can delay frond development and depress female inflorescence formation and increase male inflorescence von uexkull and fairhurst 1991 foong 1999 extended drought can cause abortion of inflorescence broekmans 1957 in some cases water stress can reduce the oil content of the mesocarp and prevented certain bunches from ripening completely ochs and daniel 1976 in view of moisture stress having a strong influence on oil palm growth and development irrigation was carried out by felda agricultural services sdn bhd fassb to study the yield response of oil palm to irrigation irrigation had shown to increase fresh fruit bunch ffb yield by 5 17 due to increase bunch number because of reduced abortion corley and hong 1982 in contrast when irrigation was implemented in the dry areas yield increase of 13 17 tons ffb ha year over that of the non irrigated palms was achieved the irrigated palms could yield up to 36 tons ffb ha year foong 1999 to obtain such high yields high rates of fertilizer are required normally oil palms are considered to have larger requirements for major mineral nutrients than other tree crops for growth and yield shorrocks 1965 ng and thamboo 1967 ng et al 1968 tan 1976 i t is well known that the fertility status of malaysian soils is generally poor therefore higher fertilizer input is required for high yields ng and thong 1985 von uexkull and fairhurst 1991 as cited in teo et al 1998 preliminary work by aya and ojuederie 1976 on interaction between irrigation and fertilizer has shown the application of fertilizer n and k had an earlier effect on palm height than on leaf number but its effect on bunch yield was rather inconsistent from year to year on the other hand kee and chew 1991 also reported that nk fertilizer application at the rate of 1 5 kg n palm year and 4 2 kg k2o palm year increased the mean ffb yield by 34 for both the irrigated and non irrigated palms under monsoonal climate and there was no interaction between irrigation and fertilizer treatments in the absence of irrigation substantially higher fertilizer rates were required to achieve the same yield as the irrigated palms previous study showed that irrigation can improve yield in contrast current fertilizer recommendation of oil palm is based on its normal potential yield this method of fertilizer recommendation is only suitable for generalized areas and this is not the best for specific areas with very high yielding potential this study was designed to determine the correct fertilizer rates for the irrigated palms to attain high sustainable yield and good profit through the proper utilization of fertilizers therefore the objectives of this study were i to determine the optimal rates of npk fertilizers for irrigated palms ii to evaluate the physiological responses of oil palms to npk fertilizer under irrigation condition and iii to determine the yield potential and best fertilizer input under irrigation condition 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental plot and design this study was carried out in ladang felda tembangau 9 latitude 03 00 59 5 n longitude 102 28 48 5 e pahang and the location of fassb tembangau 9 estate close to the bahau negeri sembilan and triang towns the planting of tekam tenera d p yangambi sc3 materials were commenced in march 2000 the soil types of this area comprise of the gong chenak series aquic kandiudults soil survey staff 2010 with clay moderately deep to deep gently undulating terrain somewhat poorly drained and moderately eroded the terrain in fassb tembangau 9 estate is undulating thus soil erosion is only a minor problem in the estate the experimental design for this trial was a 33 npk factorial rcbd trial with thirty two sample palms fig 1 plot size was 6 6 36 palms with the inner 4 4 16 palms serving as the core recording palms for bunch components bunch weight and number ffb yield t ha vegetative measurements and tissue sampling analysis the rainfall data was also collected throughout of this study period 2 2 fertilizer treatment three fertilizer rates were used for each element they were i 0 0 84 and 1 68 kg n palm yr ii 0 0 68 and 1 36 kg p2o5 palm yr and iii 0 2 4 and 4 8 kg k2o palm yr the sources of fertilizer were ammonium sulphate 21 n and 24 s for n christmas island phosphate rock cipr 34 p2o5 for p and muriate of potash mop 60 k2o for k ammonium sulphate is preferable to urea for inland soil in the inclusion of mop fertilizer rosman and foong 2000 azmi et al 2000 the combination of fertilizer treatments used for this experiment were 27 table 1 and with two replications giving 54 of total plots this experimental set up utilized about 14 5 ha 2 3 soil at the trial site 2 3 1 soil sampling and preparation soil sampling was carried at the initial stage of the experiment at each examination point the soil was examined using a jarret soil auger and the soils examined to a depth of 45 cm at each observation point the depth the color mottling texture consistence presence of rock fragments and roots were described using the terminology of the fao s guidelines for soil description food and agriculture organization 1977 and the malaysian standards terminology for soil description paramanathan 1997 four samples 200 g are taken at 0 15 and 15 45 cm depth from in situ soil these samples are separated so that the nutritional status of each zone can be compared soil samples are air dried and prepared for chemical analysis 2 3 2 soil analyses soil was characterized for their nutritional values using standard chemical analytical methods briefly particle size determination of soils was done using the pipette method gee and bauder 1986 the soil ph was measured in the suspensions of h2o soil solution ratio of 1 2 5 using a ph meter metrohm 827 riverview fl usa total c and n in soil were measured using a truspec cns analyzer leco saint joseph mi usa exchangeable cations potassium k magnesium mg calcium ca and cation exchange capacity cec of soil were determined using a leaching method with 1 m ammonium acetate solution at ph 7 00 sumner and miller 1996 and cations in solution were measured by atomic absorption spectrophotometer aas perkin elmer aanalyst 100 atomic absorption spectrometry waltham ma usa total p was extracted using an aqua regia reagent 0 5 g of soil 1 0 ml of concentrated hno3 and digested in a block digester for 15 min at

1962 using a spectrophotometer uv 1700 pharmaspec simadzu instruments japan at 882 nm all the chemicals used in this study were analytical grade having the purity of 99 9 from sigma aldrich chemie gmbh munich germany 2 4 development of irrigation system the flatbed system was used to irrigate the palm flatbeds were constructed in alternate palm rows for the non terraced area lee and romzi 2000 flatbed size was 1 5 m width 0 5 m depth the connecting drain between two adjacent flatbeds along the same inter row area was 0 2 m width 0 2 m depth 1 5 m length fig 2 irrigation was carried out to meet the evapotranspiration demand of 5 0 6 0 mm day this value was used to avoid the variation of the moisture during drought and wet seasons as observed in large areas in khazakstan farooq et al 2022 and in iran valipour 2017 the water from nearby river was pumped on to the flatbed with frequency of irrigation of about one in every 5 days the average amount of water delivered per irrigation session was about 2000 liters per palm this is equivalent to the water reception of 285 liters palm year the overview of the development of the irrigation system is presented in fig 3 2 5 fertilizer application for the first three years after planting the fertilizer rates were given to meet the early growth and production table 2 fertilizer placement for the palms was spread evenly in a band 1 5 1 8 m away from the palm base the fertilizer rates were apportioned equally into three rounds for a year the n p and k fertilizers were mixed into the same application according to the rate of the treatments the npk mixture fertilizers been spread evenly and properly to cover the circle area five split fertilizer applications were applied for a year including kieserite round 4 and boron round 5 in each application round a balanced ratio of nutrients was being applied to the palms therefore the law of the most limiting nutrient for liebig s law will not come to play and result in fertilizer wastage the factorial experiment treatment was started from fourth year 2003 and all measurements were performed from this date 2 6 oil palm foliar sampling 2 6 1 foliar sampling and sample preparation oil palm leaves and rachis were sampled from each recording palms from each treatment the samples were then composite and then often sub sampled in the laboratory prior to drying and preparation for analysis the appropriate frond was correctly sampled frond number 17 was located by counting from the first fully open frond in the center of the crown frond no 1 and removed with a sickle the frond was cut into three approximately equal sections in the middle section locate the bone on the frond and six leaflets on the right of this bone were selected and removed from each frond three leaflets were cut from each side at this section of the frond the leaflets were cleaned with a moist cloth and after removing the laminae from the leaflets they were subsequently cut into the middle 15 20 cm and the other sections discard later they were cut into pieces of about 2 cm lengths and placed in a labeled paper bag rachis sample was chosen from the same location on the frond where leaflet samples were collected a 15 cm length sample was cut into small slices approximately 1 cm thick to facilitate drying all the rachis samples from one plot were bulked in one bag they were then dried at 80 c for twelve hours the samples were then ground to pass through 1 mm sieve and kept in labeled plastic bags 2 6 2 foliar tissues analysis before analysis samples were dried at 105 5 c

switzerland based on reaction between ammonium ions with alkaline phenol and hypochlorite to form a blue complex indophenol that closely related to ammonium concentration 2 7 vegetative growth measurement plant health and vegetative were recorded on yearly basis a week before start the experiment the first leaf was tagged during transplanting to count the frond production after a year vegetative measurement including i frond production frond number 1 was marked at the beginning stage of the palm vegetative period using paint measurement of subsequent frond production data is calculated by calculating the number 1 frond up to the paint markers marked on the previous 6 months which were formerly fronds 1 then the new number 1 frond is marked with a different color painted than before number of frond production was recorded into vegetative forms ii frond length measurement was made using a measuring tape in parallel manner from leaflet with vestigial laminae on fronds number 17 to the tip of v shape area in cm iii width and thickness of the petiole the thickness and width of the petiole were measured vertically using the vernier calipers at the leaflet with vestigial laminae area in cm iv the width and thickness of the petiole were used to calculate the petiole cross section pcs which related to the frond dry weight count using the following equation pcs

destructive leaf data was obtained from the readings of length and wide of leaflet using the equation leaf area la total leaflet number leaflet length leaflet width 0 51 2 8 fresh fruit bunch yield and bunch components fresh fruit bunches ffb were harvested at 15 days cycles the ffb yields and the yields components bunch number and bunch weight were recorded during the first 7 years of treatment from 2006 to 2012 field upkeeps and palms maintenance were carried out according to the normal estate practices 2 9 statistical analysis data were averaged over the replications for all measuring dates and their means were used in deriving relationships between vegetative growth foliar analysis and yield parameters the differences in palm growth leaf nutrient analysis and ffb yield analysis between the npk treatments were calculated using the sas 9 4 statistical procedure sas 2002 the tukey s honestly significant difference hsd all pairwise comparison test was used to detect statistical differences among the means at p 0 05 significance level 3 results and discussion 3 1 rainfall distribution the rainfall and number of rain day data for fassb tembangau 9 estate for the 10 year period 2005 2012 showed that the total annual rainfall for the period ranges from 1538 mm to 2233 mm fig 4 a three to four dry months 150 mm occurs in this estate the total annual rain day ranges from 75 to 122 days the seven year means for fassb tembangau 9 estate corresponded to 1872 mm and 103 days this area has a moderate rainfall with a pronounced dry period of 3 4 months in a year a period of low rainfall is generally considered a good criterion for oil palm as it helps to increase in the sunshine hours subsequently increased photosynthesis rate and help improve yields in contrast a period of low rainfall can cause moisture deficient resulting in lower yields thus the climate in the study area is well suited for oil palm cultivation but irrigation can improve yields due to better photosynthesis in the dry season if moisture is available 3 2 physico chemical characteristics of soil the parent materials of this study site consist mainly of sub recent riverine alluvium the unit of mapping currently used is the soil series and is identified based on the soils of malaysia paramananthan 2000a 2010b the keys to the identification of malaysian soils according to parent materials paramananthan 2000a 2010b the soils developed over sub recent alluvium occur on undulating 4 12 or 2 6 slopes terrain in this study area namely gong chenak series aquic kandiudults soil survey staff 2010 the soils are a deep somewhat imperfect to imperfectly drained soils with brownish yellow to yellow upper subsoils at depths below 50 cm the color changes to light gray indicating the presence of a fluctuating water table these areas may be flooded for a few days after periods of heavy rains due to the clayey soil texture table 3 most of these areas have been drained and planted these soils have a clay content of 48 in the surface and increases to 73 with depth table 3 silt and sand contents were low in the range of 12 33 and 12 29 respectively fine sand dominates the sand fraction these soils were acidic with a ph range of 4 5 4 7 the organic c contents and total n values were low and decrease with depth total p 324 Œºp g soil and plant available p 11 0 Œºp g soil were also low the exchangeable cations are low and dominated by ca the cation exchange capacity values and base saturation values were low hence the soil is considering having a low in fertility status 3 3 foliar and rachis nutrient contents there were increased in n p and k foliar status following the application of fertilizer n table 4 however foliar n status of n1 and n2 were almost similar treatment without n fertilizer n0 showed an inadequate foliar nutrient status at 2 41 and below foliar n critical level 2 65 for oil palm at this age this clearly observed by the size of oil palm foliar fig 5 the average value obtained in n1 and n2 are slightly lower than 2 79 n reported by lee et al 2011 on the same genotype used in the present study but under different type of soil and location with additional p rate of application there was no increase in n and k foliar nutrient status except for p nutrient status and at normal level addition of k fertilizer did not result in any significant difference on p and k foliar nutrient status and still at the normal level for p foliar status but at below normal level for k foliar status consequently n deficiency symptom was observed in the entire treatment plot without n fertilizer control plot the appearance of nutrient deficiency symptom in foliar following fertilizer addition differed significantly among nutrients the symptom was observed at different time where n and k in year 2006 tables 4 and 6 and p 2008 table 5 the significant effect of n fertilizer was observed on n and k foliar nutrient status by year 2010 and on p foliar status one year earlier in 2009 on yearly basis the was no significant effect of p fertilizer on p and k foliar nutrient status up to year 2010 except for after 2011 onward and on n in 2009 onwards in contrast effect of k fertilizer showed a similar k status throughout the study period with k value below the standard of 0 9 1 2 k foliar status for a similar age of oil palm the average observed value was 33 4 lower than that on the same genotype on different soil and location at 1 10 k lee et al 2011 oil palms generally respond to higher k levels when n fertilizer is sufficient and n sources can affect k absorption there were clear responses of n and p treatment effect on p rachis but not for k rachis status however effect of k fertilizer treatment showed a significant difference on k rachis nutrient status table 7 fertilizer k application had significantly increased the k content from 1 44 in control plot to about 1 60 for fertilizer rates 1 or 2 during the study period average of 7 years this k value was like the k in rachis 1 59 for comparable oil palm genotype yangambi sc3 planted on undulating soil laid out on in 1999 at the tun razak centre for agricultural services jerantut pahang malaysia lee et al 2014 these results revealed that p and k contents in rachis retained at very high level over the time and indirectly implied that the inherent p and k status in rachis of the oil palm are on high side this is to provide support for oil palm growth and to sustain yields for this period of the study with this also it may explain why the leaf p and k contents is also sustained at satisfactory level in their respective control plots 3 4 vegetative growth measurement except for n fertilizer there was no significant difference p 0 05 between rates of p and k on the vegetative parameters measured in this study during 7 years of data recording table 8 in case of n treatment n1 and n2 were almost similar in value this attributed to much lower value of the vegetative growth parameter measured in the beginning of data recording in 2006 significantly only in leaf area and dry weight but then increased to a greater value in the frond length frond dry weight and leaf area after 7 years 2012 consequently on average after 7 years the contribution of fertilizer plots compared to control was 23 for leaf area and 36 for frond dry weight 3 5 leaf nutrient contents in frond 17 nitrogen p and k contents in leaves of frond 17 of oil palm showed that the treatment n0 had significantly lower nutrients content of 0 0955 kg n frond 0 0062 kg p frond and 0 0269 kg k frond in leaves compared to the rest of the treatments n1 and n2 table 9 although n2 showed the highest value but they are similar in contrast fertilizer p and k did not show any significant different on n p and k leaf nutrient contents in contrast for the same genotype yangambi sc3 these values were about 2 2 5 and 1 4 fold greater for the n p and k respectively lee et al 2014 even though both are clayey soil with an almost similar in the amount of clay content 46 has been classified as munchong soil series under the soil taxonomy typic hapludox 3 6 fresh fruit bunch yield and yield components of oil palm though ffb yield increased with the addition of k as compared to control but they were not statistically significant between levels of k table 10 this is attributed to the ability of k used in this study able to raise palm leaf k above the critical response level 1 0 hence this could explain to the lack of yield response to higher k fertilization in comparison to conventional system generally ffb yield at ascending phase year 06 09 yielded over 25 44 ton ha and at prime yielding phase 10 years reduced by 10 to 23 t ha for this kind of soil in this area the drastic yield dropped mainly due to severe dry spell occurred in that period fig 2 in contrast with great effort had been implemented by irrigation system the present fertilizer trial plot during prime age 10 12 was able to sustain yield at 24 9 ton ha for n2 vs 19 70 ton ha n0 which translate to about an additional 28 increases in ffb yield upward ffb yield trend was observed from 16 75 ton ha 2006 and reached up to 29 73 ton ha 2009 and there after dropped to 24 57 ton ha 2010 table 11 for the control treatment at ascending phase over 4 years 2006 2009 yielded at 24 30 ton ha and dropped by almost 16 versus with complete fertilizer treatment at 29 00 ton ha yield for the plot without fertilizer further deteriorated at prime age phase over 3 years 2010 2012 and yield dropped further by 3 20 ton ha 13 to 21 09 ton ha hence it is obviously without fertilizers the ffb yield performance cannot be fully sustained once the fertilizer continues to be supplied then ffb yields showed an improvement to 23 7 in ffb yielded to more than 26 05 ton ha at prime yielding phase those highest yielded plots can reach up to 26 0 ton ha n1p1k2 and n2p2k2 in contrast under almost a similar soil condition and oil palm genotype this ffb yield was about 10 greater than ffb yield by lee et al 2011 2014 at 23 68 ton ha the importance of fertilizers input to sustain oil palm yield is well demonstrated from the above trial those without fertilizer plot n0p0k0 average for over 7 years 2006 2012 only yielded at 22 92 ton ha as compared with complete fertilizer plot at 26 50 ton ha as mentioned above the higher yield was significantly contributed by the application of n fertilizer nitrogen fertilizer significantly improved ffb performance with increasing in bunch weight kg palm and average bunch weight kg bunch fig 6 in this study n losses is at the minimum level due to the efficient use of irrigation system where the added fertilizer is readily soluble and efficiently uptake by the roots of oil palm ultimately produced a higher ffb yield under conventional system the largest losses are emissions of nh3 and leaching of no3 corresponding to 0 1 42 and 1 34 of mineral n applied respectively pardon et al 2016 in addition n losses may occur as n2o nox n2 emissions leaching nh3 volatilization and runoff the most critical conditions for n losses occur during the immature phase when young palms uptake is low and during the mature phase in areas with sparse soil cover or receiving high amounts of fertilizers pardon et al 2016 phosphorus and k fertilizer rate did not show any significant difference between the treatment for all parameter measured table 12 in spite the higher rate of n addition there was no further increasing in bunch weight and ffb yield t ha during this period of this study fig 7 there was no interaction between n p and k fertilizer treatments or in combination to the oil palm growth parameters and ffb yield and components no data present observed in the 7 years period in this study therefore by reducing the slight amount of n p and or k fertilizers by exploiting the synergistic effect of nk is possible to obtaining optimum vegetative growth and at the same time high ffb yield besides that n may also interact with p fertilizer and that together they may interact with other nutrients 4 conclusion nitrogen and p fertilizer responses were observed in foliar and rachis nutrient status on mature palm under the irrigation condition however only n fertilizer responded to vegetative growth and ffb yield through an improvement in average bunch weight and bunch weight per palm the highest ffb yield attained at the level of n1p1k1 and n2p2k2 at 26 70 t ha and 26 50 t ha respectively the absent of n fertilizer lead to a n deficiency symptom a positive response to n fertilizer was probably due to the low n status in inherent soil at higher rate of k allowed for the efficient use of more n resulted in better early vegetative growth and ffb yields a higher amount of k and mg supply in the soil probably translated to no response of p and k fertilizers but the k foliar nutrient status showed a below normal level over a period of seven

9229,plastic film mulching fm has been widely used to increase wheat yield in arid and semiarid regions however most researchers have focused on fm during the growth period of winter wheat as such a knowledge gap remains regarding fm in other periods accordingly we established a long term field experiment in 2002 that included four treatments on the loess plateau of china these four treatments included the following regular fertilization without film np regular fertilization with fm in the fallow period npff regular fertilization with fm in the growth period npfg regular fertilization with fm for the whole year npfw in 2020 2021 we measured the soil water distribution and root distribution in the 0 200 cm profile the soil temperature in 5 15 30 and 50 cm soil layers the winter wheat grain yield the water use efficiency wue and rainfall use efficiency rue our results demonstrated that compared with np the winter wheat yield of npff npfg and npfw improved by 37 1 7 8 and 21 3 p 0 05 the wue of npff npfg and npfw was 29 5 14 3 and 12 5 higher than np additionally the rue of npff npfg and npfw was 37 8 8 9 and 22 2 higher than np the profile s annual average soil temperature of npff npfg and npfw were 0 6 c 1 0 c and 1 4 c higher than np further the root mass of npff npfg and npfw were 16 7 41 7 and 8 3 higher than np respectively and the root mass percentage of npff npfg and npfw decreased significantly by 7 3 6 0 and 24 8 less than np respectively in the 0 40 cm soil layer p 0 05 in sum fm during the fallow period was considered an appropriate yield increase measure on the loess plateau of china and similar regions because of its advantages in collecting precipitation during the fallow period regulating wheat growth temperature and obtaining high yields keywords best index loess plateau mulching period root distribution water use efficiency data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction to meet the growing population and the increasing demand for animal feed the food and agriculture organization fao has proposed that food production must be increased by more than 1 4 times by 2050 bruinsma 2009 of china s total land area 51 2 is arid and semiarid and total food crop production in these areas occupied by more than 50 of the country s total output mainly distributed in northwest and northern china including the loess plateau huang et al 2011 li and ling 1992 plastic film mulching fm as an effective practice to boost and stabilize crop production has been widely used in agricultural practices especially in cold arid and semiarid regions gan et al 2013 gao et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 approximately 19 of china s arable farmland was covered with plastic film by 2014 wang et al 2016 fm plays an essential role in increasing crop yields zhang et al 2013 found that the yield of fm in dry years normal rainfall years and wet rainfall years increased by 50 100 30 90 and 10 40 respectively additionally a meta analysis by gao et al 2019 demonstrated that fm increased the maize yield by 32 6 29 6 23 1 20 6 17 7 and 4 7 in central china northwest china eastern china northern china northeast china and southwest china respectively further li et al 2001 and liu et al 2014 indicated that fm increased the grain yield of maize by 39 137 and that of wheat by 3 18 fan et al 2005 rehman et al 2009 the loess plateau is a typical arid and semiarid area in china and an important agricultural planting area in northwest china winter wheat triticum aestivum l is the main crop in this region the fallow period of winter wheat is from july september and the growth period of which is from october june the growth period is exactly separated from the region s season of concentrated precipitation guo et al 2012 the annual precipitation on the loess plateau is 350 600 mm and the seasonal distribution is highly uneven the rainfall is mainly distributed throughout july september accounting for more than 70 of the annual rainfall early studies found that fm significantly reduced the exposed surface area reduced ineffective evaporation on the ground improved the soil moisture condition increased the ground temperature promoted the early growth of crops promoted the root growth and improved grain yield fu et al 2021 gan et al 2013 li et al 2013a 2013b wang et al 2009 zhang et al 2022 the primary precipitation of the loess plateau occurs in the fallow period but the high temperature and soil evaporation during this period are not conducive to the storage of rainfall the storage of this precipitation may have a favorable effect on the growth of winter wheat all aforementioned researchers have focused on the effects of fm on crops during their growth periods but few have focused on the effects of fm on crops during their fallow periods as such we considered that examining fm only in the growth period may not allow us to comprehensively explore the potential of fm in yield increase and thus it is essential to conduct further research on mulching during the fallow period and the whole year to study the production increasing mechanism of mulching in different periods in addition previous studies have not comprehensively evaluated the warming effect of fm in the growth period nor the spatiotemporal changes of soil temperature under different mulching periods therefore we conducted a 19 year study at the field station on the loess plateau of china that included four plastic mulching periods 1 np no fm 2 npff fm in the fallow period 3 npfg fm in the growth period and 4 npfw fm in the whole year with this study we aimed to i explore the response of soil moisture soil temperature and winter wheat growth on different mulching periods and ii clarify how mulching in different periods regulates crop yield and water use efficiency we hoped that the results of this study can provide guidance for decisions regarding mulching periods and winter wheat yield increasing on the loess plateau of china and similar regions 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description we conducted the present study at the national agro ecosystem research station 35 12 n 107 40 e located in a typical dryland farming area on the loess plateau in the changwu county shannxi province china the climate of the study site is characterized by a warm temperature semiarid continental monsoon climate the annual rainfall is 584 mm with 60 of the annual rainfall occurring in the summer fallow period of the winter wheat from july september with high evaporation winter wheat is one of the main food crops in this area water resources are mainly from soil storage in the profile and supply of rainfall without irrigation condition because the groundwater is 70 m and ineffective for crop growth use the asynchrony of rainfall and crops consumption of water use affects grain yield and its stability as such precipitation and air temperature were measured by the automated weather station at the experimental site changwu experimental station meteorological observatory ws std1 england as shown in fig 1 2 2 experimental design and crop management the present field experiment was a long term agroecosystem research in dryland farming from 2002 2021 four treatments were applied in this field experiment 1 regular fertilization without film np 2 regular fertilization with fm in fallow period npff 3 regular fertilization with fm in the growth period npfg 4 regular fertilization with fm in the whole year npfw each treatment was replicated three times plots with a complete randomized design and the area of plot was 35 m2 7 0 5 0 m we planted the local cultivar changhan 58 from 2002 2014 and changhang 1 from 2015 2020 the seeding rate was 170 kg ha 1 and 24 rows of winter wheat were planted in each plot before sowing and after harvesting we plowed all treatments with a 20 cm depth following local farming habits that plowing each plot twice with a rototiller as base fertilizer we used regular fertilization means urea 150 kg n ha 1 and calcium superphosphate 75 kg p2o5 ha 1 these fertilizers are purchased from local fertilizer company and the amount of fertilizer used was consistent with the average local fertilizer application amount before sowing we evenly spread the fertilizer into each plot and mixed it with the soil after plowing winter wheat was planted in late september 2020 and harvested in late june 2021 for mulching treatment winter wheat was planted through drilling holes in the plastic film further npff plots were mulched with plastic film after harvest and then the plastic film was manually removed before sowing npfg plots were mulched during the growth period and removed the plastic film after harvesting npfw plots were mulched in the growth period after harvesting the film was removed and re mulching after plowing until next sowing the plastic film used in this study was white transparent polyethylene film with 600 mm wide and 0

and can adjust the growth ability of crops by increasing the surface soil temperature chen et al 2007 sreedevi et al 2017 zhang et al 2009 in the present study by monitoring the soil temperature at the 5 15 30 and 50 cm soil layers during the whole year we found that fm significantly improved the average soil temperature in the 0 50 cm profile by 0 6 c 1 4 c in the whole year table 1 previous studies reported that the soil temperature increased in fm ranged from 0 8 c 2 9 c in different regions he et al 2016 mo et al 2016 these results were similar with our study npfw significantly increased the accumulated soil temperature in the 0 50 cm profile by 13 8 44 9 and 7 0 than np in the seedling stage overwintering stage and regreening stage of winter wheat respectively however the accumulated soil temperature in the 0 50 cm profile of npfw decreased slightly by 2 0 2 5 and 0 6 than np in the jointing stage filling stage and maturity stage of winter wheat respectively fig 5 previous studies indicated that the effect of fm on soil temperature varied with the growth stage of crops that the warming effect in the early stage and the cooling effect in the later stage chen et al 2014 fan et al 2014 the study of deng et al 2019 on maize on the loess plateau demonstrated that fm increased the soil temperature in the jointing stage but decreased soil temperature in the filling and maturity stages our result aligned with those from previous studies the possible reasons are as follows first fm provided higher accumulated soil temperature during wheat s early growth stage which promoted the tiller and reproductive growth of wheat second the shading effects caused by a larger canopy in the later stage of growth reduced the solar radiation reaching the ground surface table 4 in addition npff significantly increased the accumulated soil temperature in the 0 50 cm profile by 13 2 3 2 and 6 4 than np in the fallow period seedling stage and overwintering stage of winter wheat respectively fig 5 unlike conventional mulching measures npff was mulching in the fallow period the high level of precipitation collected by npff before sowing increased the soil water content fig 6 abu hamdeh 2003 proposed that the soil heat capacity increased with increased moisture content as such the soil heat capacity of npff increased in the present study further the accumulated soil temperature in the 0 50 cm profile of npff was higher than np in the fallow period although the plastic film was removed before sowing the higher soil heat capacity may reduce the fluctuation of soil temperature and provide higher accumulated soil temperature in the early stage of wheat growth than that of np fig 5a npfg significantly increased the accumulated soil temperature by 15 5 than np in the 0 50 cm profile during the whole growth period of wheat fig 5 however no cooling effect in the late growth stage of winter wheat of npfg existed which may attribute to the lower lai table 4 which increased the solar radiation on the soil surface dekker and ritsema 1997 zhang et al 2017 the aforementioned results indicated that the seasonal changes of accumulated soil temperature varied with mulching period npfg can provide higher accumulated soil temperature in the 0 50 cm profile during the whole growth period when compared with np however npff and npfw demonstrated a warming effect in the early growth stage and a cooling effect in the late growth stage of winter wheat 4 2 plastic film mulching promoted the soil water condition in the present study three mulching patterns improved wue and rue and the rue of npff and npfw significantly improved by 37 8 and 22 2 than np table 2 our results aligned with existing meta analyses lei et al 2021 ma et al 2018 which demonstrated that the wue of fm increased by 16 2 21 9 on the loess plateau of china where dryland farming has been conducted for thousands of years this is primarily because fm reduced the intense evaporation in the soil surface and collected the rainfall especially in the fallow period resulting in higher wue and rue fu et al 2021 further we found that the sws of npff and npfw in 0 200 cm profile significantly increased by 6 3 30 2 mm and 9 0 43 2 mm before sowing compared with np further the soil water recharging amount of npff and npfw in the 0 200 cm profile significantly increased by 37 2 54 5 mm and 43 7 64 0 mm than np however the soil water recharging amount of npfg was significantly lower than npff and npfw table 2 the possible reason was that traditional mulching measures usually occur in the growth period of plants but npff and npfw had mulching measures both in the growth and fallow periods which effectively collected rainfall and reduced soil evaporation in the fallow period the sws of npfg was higher than np before sowing and the et of npfg significantly decreased by 5 7 thus the sws of npfg in the 0 200 cm profile in harvest was higher than np table 2 it was found that et of npff and npfw increased while that of npfg decreased table 2 previous studies indicated that fm increased et by promoting crop growth and canopy formation gan et al 2013 li et al 2004 our results aligned with these regarding npff and npfw but differed regarding npfg this is primarily because the higher sws before sowing of npff and npfw in this study provided good moisture and temperature conditions to promote crop growth and canopy formation resulting in increased transpiration and et zhang et al 2018 a study of he et al 2016 on the loess plateau on winter wheat indicated that the et of fm in the growth period was influenced by the sws before sowing the lower sws before sowing provided less available soil water supply during the growing season and limited the winter wheat transpiration zhang et al 2007 however npfg decreased et in this study were possibly attributed to the following reasons for one thing the precipitation in the growth period in this study year was 271 6 mm accounting for 50 6 of the annual precipitation fig 1a fm may reduce soil evaporation and increase the collection of small precipitation events 5 mm than no mulching jiang and li 2015 li et al 2001 zhang et al 2013 for another it is possibly due to the lower lai and straw yield of npfg in this study and decreased crop evapotranspiration table 4 in addition the crop coverage and crop coefficient may be affected by mulching measures and the potential crop et calculated according to the fao penman montelth model must also be affected allen et al 1998 el shirbeny et al 2022 valipour 2017 because we only considered et from the perspective of water balance it is necessary for us to accurately calculate the potential crop et according to the variation of crop coefficient in future research 4 3 plastic film mulching promoted the growth of wheat roots our study demonstrated that fm improved the root mass root length root tip and specific root length in the 0 200 cm profile table 3 in the same region the study of zhang et al 2022 on winter wheat and the study of gao et al 2014 on maize showed that fm promoted root growth and improved the root length density in the soil profile the results were similar to ours these may be related to the improvement of soil moisture and temperature conditions by fm qin et al 2018 in the present study fm increased the root percentage in the deep soil layer 40 200 cm and the root mass of npff and npfg in the 0 40 cm soil layer fig 7c however the root mass of npfw significantly decreased in 0 40 cm soil layer fig 7b the study of clarkson et al 2000 has shown that roots would be concentrated in topsoil in good soil water conditions and grow deep into the soil in bad water conditions additionally li et al 2021 also found that fm improved the root trait in the low rainfall 450 mm year in arid and semiarid regions but the root trait promoting effects of fm were reduced in the upper soil layer and possibly enhanced in the deeper layers similar results were found by li et al 2018a the annual rainfall in this study in 2020 2021 was 537 2 mm which was a normal year in this region there was a lesser soil moisture difference between np and fm fm not only increased the root biomass but also promoted root extension to deep soil xu et al 2016 zhang et al 2022 in addition a meta analysis of fm on root traits and yield showed that the roots in the upper soil layer had a strong positive correlation with yield li et al 2021 the study of wang et al 2014 on wheat also demonstrated that the winter wheat yield was strongly positively correlated with root weight mass density in 20 40 and 40 60 cm soil layers in the present study however root mass in the 0 40 cm soil layer of npfg and npff were positively correlated with grain yield while npfw was negatively correlated with grain yield further the yield of npfw is higher than np but the root mass decreased in the 0 40 cm soil layer fig 7b table 4 it is possibly because the root in deep soil layer absorbed an increased level of soil water and nutrients ultimately increasing crop yield xie et al 2005 4 4 plastic film mulching promoted the growth of winter wheat wheat yields under npff npfg and npfw were 37 1 7 8 and 21 3 higher than np table 4 the study of chen et al 2015 on the loess plateau showed that fm in the growth period significantly increased the wheat yield by 18 0 from 2008 2009 another field experiment from 2009 2010 on the loess plateau also showed that fm in the whole year promoted the winter wheat yield by 15 1 he et al 2018 this may be related to the fact that fm promotes crop growth and yield formation in semiarid rain fed areas by adjusting soil water and temperature conditions he et al 2016 li et al 2001 zhang et al 2013 2018 additionally the wheat yield under fm also varied with annual precipitation a regional evaluation of fm on the loess plateau indicated that the yield of fm averagely increased by 66 0 with precipitation less than 600 mm while the yield increased only 20 0 with precipitation greater than 600 mm zhang et al 2018 the study of he et al 2018 showed that fm lost the capacity to improve yield by increasing soil water primarily because the precipitation from 2011 2012 and 2013 2014 were more than 700 mm from 2012 2013 the 447 mm annual precipitation still resulted in reduced grain yield in fm given that less rainfall 47 mm during the vegetative period exacerbated water stress and affected canopy growth in the present study the annual precipitation was 537 2 mm 600 mm 265 6 mm in the fallow period and 271 6 mm in the growth period which was close to the 2016 2021 average rainfall values annual 598 6 mm fallow period 312 4 mm growth period 286 3 mm fig 1b therefore the results of this study can be used to reflect the actual situation of fm in the local area and can be applied to similar climate regions in the present study npfg had the minimum grain yield in three fm measures several possible explanations for this observation exist 1 the accumulated soil temperature of npfg in the regreening stage was significantly higher than npff and npfw and thus the warming effect at this stage had a negative influence on spike number and grain yield figs 3 and 8 2 positive correlation was found in our study between grain yield and the profile s average accumulated soil temperature in the fallow period fig 8 but npfg had no mulching measures in the fallow period and the profile s average accumulated soil temperature in the fallow period of npfg was significantly lower than npff and npfw fig 5b and 3 the highest r s was found in npfg in our study and grain yield was negatively correlated with r s given that more nutrients in this treatment were used for root growth rather than shoot growth figs 3 and 8 in this study npff and npfw collected the precipitation in the fallow period and they had higher sws than np and npfg before sowing but npff showed a higher grain yield than npfw tables 2 and 4 the result may attribute to the following reasons for one thing the profile s average accumulated soil temperature in the seedling stage of npff was significantly improved than np which promoted wheat germination and the lower the profile s average accumulated soil temperature in the regreening stage of npff than npfw produced a higher spike number than npfw figs 5a and 8 table 4 for another the suitable soil moisture and temperature conditions in npfw produced excessive vegetation growth li et al 2018b thereby influenced grain yield table 4 the aboveground and belowground biomass allocation of crops was reflected by r s li et al 2015 in the present study the r s of npff and npfw decreased while that of npfg increased indicating that npff and npfw promote shoot growth and npfg promoted root growth possibly due to the good soil temperature conditions of npfg from overwintering to maturity stages fig 8 the profile s annual average soil temperature sws in june 2021 wue rue root mass grain yield straw yield harvest index and lai were chosen to calculate bi table 4 the results showed that fm increased the bi value and npff was the largest 9 7 which indicates that the effect of fm on soil warming water retention root growth and yield improvement in this region was better than that in the no mulching condition and npff was the best choice 4 5 correlation analysis it is found that grain yield was positively correlated with the profile s average soil temperature in the fallow period r 0 844 p 0 05 and the profile s average accumulated soil temperature in the fallow period r 0 837 p 0 05 while negatively correlated with the profile s average accumulated soil temperature in the jointing stage r 0 706 p 0 05 and filling stage r 0 735 p 0 05 fig 8 these results indicated that the high accumulated soil temperature in the fallow period was beneficial to obtain higher grain yield while the high accumulated soil temperature in the jointing and filling stages may reduce the grain yield the following reasons may contribute to these results for one thing the higher soil accumulated temperature during the fallow period primarily occurred in npff and npfw treatments both of them had higher soil water content this higher moisture content may reduce the soil temperature fluctuation store parts of heat for seed germination and promote a yield increase for another the jointing and filling stages of winter wheat occurred in periods of high air temperature as such the higher soil temperature in these periods was bound to produce heat stress on crops and prevent wheat growth chakraborty et al 2008 fan et al 2012a grain yield was positively correlated with soil water recharging amount r 0 851 p 0 05 and soil water consumption amount r 0 706 p 0 05 fig 8 these results indicated that the rainfall collected in the fallow period and the higher water consumption amount during the growth period were beneficial to yield increases as local farmers said good harvests of winter wheat from stored soil water in the last year the study of zhang et al 2013 also demonstrated that presowing soil water is as vital as in season precipitation for wheat yield in addition for fm treatments the soil evaporation during the growth period can be neglected crop transpiration was the main form of soil water consumption and higher transpiration promotes the formation of dry matter and thus the higher water consumption produced higher grain yield in this study the spike number was negatively correlated with average accumulated soil temperature in the regreening stage r 0 804 p 0 05 jointing stage r 0 939 p 0 05 filling stage r 0 961 p 0 05 and maturity stage r 0 981 p 0 05 fig 8 these results are consistent with the results of previous study that determined that the cooling effect of mulching from overwintering stage to the maturity stage significantly promoted the formation of spike number li et al 2021 in addition the study of maas et al 1994 proposed that the grain yield of winter wheat showed a positive linear correlation with spike number which was the best explanation for the positive correlation between grain yield and spike number in the present study 4 6 implications and expectations of the study in recent years many agricultural management methods have been explored to increase food production in dry areas akpinar ferrand and cecunjanin 2014 zhao et al 2014 fm has been considered the most suitable and effective measure to increase production in arid and semiarid areas fan and xie 2012b ingman et al 2015 based on previous studies this study proposed that mulching during the fallow period of winter wheat may improve the potential of fm to increase crop yields in the present study the grain yield of npff npfg and npfw were significantly higher than np and the grain yield of npff and npfw were 27 2 1424 1 kg ha 1 and 12 5 657 0 kg ha 1 higher than npfg table 4 in addition the correlation analysis in this study demonstrated that fm during the fallow period ensured a high winter wheat yield by increasing soil moisture condition before sowing increasing soil accumulated temperature in the seedling stage and decreasing soil accumulated temperature in the late growth stage of winter wheat fig 8 we believe that this study provides a new method to increase crop production on the loess plateau of china and similar climate regions and is also to solving the global food shortage although fm is of great significance for the improvement of global food production it also brings undeniable environmental problems li et al 2022 the plastic film residual is difficult to remove and decompose and its accumulation is harmful to soil health crop growth as well as food safety huang et al 2020 ng et al 2018 rochman 2018 therefore if biodegradable plastic film is to replace ordinary plastic film it will be more conducive to the sustainable development of fm in the fallow period in addition the mulching period affected soil moisture and temperature conditions which will inevitably affect soil microbial activities and nutrient transformation thus further research must be conducted regarding these aspects in the future 5 conclusion fm in the fallow period the growth period and the whole year was beneficial for increasing winter wheat grain yield increasing water use efficiency increasing rainfall use efficiency increasing the profile s average soil temperature promoting root growth and promoting the downward extension of the root system fm in the fallow period growth period and whole year significantly increased the winter wheat yield by 37 1 1802 5 kg ha 1 7 8 378 4 kg ha 1 and 21 3 1035 4 kg ha 1 respectively than no mulching p 0

c 9 0 1 0 c and 12 6 1 4 c than no mulching the root length of fm in the fallow period growth period and whole year significantly increased by 13 9 91 1 and 46 5 than no mulching the root tip of fm in the fallow period growth period and whole year were 66 0 68 0 and 56 0 higher than no mulching the root mass of fm in the fallow period growth period and whole year significantly increased by 16 7 0 2 g 41 7 0 5 g and 8 3 0 1 g than no mulching the root mass percentage of fm in the fallow period growth period and whole year were significantly decreased by 7 3 6 0 and 24 8 than np in the 0 40 cm soil layer respectively p 0 05 in addition fm during the fallow period was considered as the most suitable mulching measure for the loess plateau of china and similar regions because this measure can effectively collect the precipitation in the fallow period accurately adjust the soil temperature to provide suitable soil temperature guarantee for the growth of wheat at each stage and obtain the

9229,plastic film mulching fm has been widely used to increase wheat yield in arid and semiarid regions however most researchers have focused on fm during the growth period of winter wheat as such a knowledge gap remains regarding fm in other periods accordingly we established a long term field experiment in 2002 that included four treatments on the loess plateau of china these four treatments included the following regular fertilization without film np regular fertilization with fm in the fallow period npff regular fertilization with fm in the growth period npfg regular fertilization with fm for the whole year npfw in 2020 2021 we measured the soil water distribution and root distribution in the 0 200 cm profile the soil temperature in 5 15 30 and 50 cm soil layers the winter wheat grain yield the water use efficiency wue and rainfall use efficiency rue our results demonstrated that compared with np the winter wheat yield of npff npfg and npfw improved by 37 1 7 8 and 21 3 p 0 05 the wue of npff npfg and npfw was 29 5 14 3 and 12 5 higher than np additionally the rue of npff npfg and npfw was 37 8 8 9 and 22 2 higher than np the profile s annual average soil temperature of npff npfg and npfw were 0 6 c 1 0 c and 1 4 c higher than np further the root mass of npff npfg and npfw were 16 7 41 7 and 8 3 higher than np respectively and the root mass percentage of npff npfg and npfw decreased significantly by 7 3 6 0 and 24 8 less than np respectively in the 0 40 cm soil layer p 0 05 in sum fm during the fallow period was considered an appropriate yield increase measure on the loess plateau of china and similar regions because of its advantages in collecting precipitation during the fallow period regulating wheat growth temperature and obtaining high yields keywords

increasing demand for animal feed the food and agriculture organization fao has proposed that food production must be increased by more than 1 4 times by 2050 bruinsma 2009 of china s total land area 51 2 is arid and semiarid and total food crop production in these areas occupied by more than 50 of the country s total output mainly distributed in northwest and northern china including the loess plateau huang et al 2011 li and ling 1992 plastic film mulching fm as an effective practice to boost and stabilize crop production has been widely used in agricultural practices especially in cold arid and semiarid regions gan et al 2013 gao et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 approximately 19 of china s arable farmland was covered with plastic film by 2014 wang et al 2016 fm plays an essential role in increasing crop yields zhang et al 2013 found that the yield of fm in dry years normal rainfall years and wet rainfall years increased by 50 100 30 90 and 10 40 respectively additionally a meta analysis by gao et al 2019 demonstrated that fm increased the maize yield by 32 6 29 6 23 1 20 6 17 7 and 4 7 in central china northwest china eastern china northern china northeast china and southwest china respectively further li et al 2001 and liu et al 2014 indicated that fm increased the grain yield of maize by 39 137 and that of wheat by 3 18 fan et al 2005 rehman et al 2009 the loess plateau is a typical arid and semiarid area in china and an important agricultural planting area in northwest china winter wheat triticum aestivum l is the main crop in this region the fallow period of winter wheat is from july september and the growth period of which is from october june the growth period is exactly separated from the region s season of concentrated precipitation guo et al 2012 the annual precipitation on the loess plateau is 350 600 mm and the seasonal distribution is highly uneven the rainfall is mainly distributed throughout july september accounting for more than 70 of the annual rainfall early studies found that fm significantly reduced the exposed surface area reduced ineffective evaporation on the ground improved the soil moisture condition increased the ground temperature promoted the early growth of crops promoted the root growth and improved grain yield fu et al 2021 gan et al 2013 li et al 2013a 2013b wang et al 2009 zhang et al 2022 the primary precipitation of the loess plateau occurs in the fallow period but the high temperature and soil evaporation during this period are not conducive to the storage of rainfall the storage of this precipitation may have a favorable effect on the growth of winter wheat all aforementioned researchers have focused on the effects of fm on crops during their growth periods but few have focused on the effects of fm on crops during their fallow periods as such we considered that examining fm only in the growth period may not allow us to comprehensively explore the potential of fm in yield increase and thus it is essential to conduct further research on mulching during the fallow period and the whole year to study the production increasing mechanism of mulching in different periods in addition previous studies have not comprehensively evaluated the warming effect of fm in the growth period nor the spatiotemporal changes of soil temperature under different mulching periods therefore we conducted a 19 year study at the field station on the loess plateau of china that included four plastic mulching periods 1 np no fm 2 npff fm in the fallow period 3 npfg fm in the growth period and 4 npfw fm in the whole year with this study we aimed to i explore the response of soil moisture soil temperature and winter wheat growth on different mulching periods and ii clarify how mulching in different periods regulates crop yield and water use efficiency we hoped that the results of this study can provide guidance for decisions regarding mulching periods and winter wheat yield increasing on the loess plateau of china and similar regions 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description we conducted the present study at the national agro ecosystem research station 35 12 n 107 40 e located in a typical dryland farming area on the loess plateau in the changwu county shannxi province china the climate of the study site is characterized by a warm temperature semiarid continental monsoon climate the annual rainfall is 584 mm with 60 of the annual rainfall occurring in the summer fallow period of the winter wheat from july september with high evaporation winter wheat is one of the main food crops in this area water resources are mainly from soil storage in the profile and supply of rainfall without irrigation condition because the groundwater is 70 m and ineffective for crop growth use the asynchrony of rainfall and crops consumption of water use affects grain yield and its stability as such precipitation and air temperature were measured by the automated weather station at the experimental site changwu experimental station meteorological observatory ws std1 england as shown in fig 1 2 2 experimental design and crop management the present field experiment was a long term agroecosystem research in dryland farming from 2002 2021 four treatments were applied in this field experiment 1 regular fertilization without film np 2 regular fertilization with fm in fallow period npff 3 regular fertilization with fm in the growth period npfg 4 regular fertilization with fm in the whole year npfw each treatment was replicated three times plots with a complete randomized design and the area of plot was 35 m2 7 0 5 0 m we planted the local cultivar changhan 58 from 2002 2014 and changhang 1 from 2015 2020 the seeding rate was 170 kg ha 1 and 24 rows of winter wheat were planted in each plot before sowing and after harvesting we plowed all treatments with a 20 cm depth following local farming habits that plowing each plot twice with a rototiller as base fertilizer we used regular fertilization means urea 150 kg n ha 1 and calcium superphosphate 75 kg p2o5 ha 1 these fertilizers are purchased from local fertilizer company and the amount of fertilizer used was consistent with the average local fertilizer application amount before sowing we evenly spread the fertilizer into each plot and mixed it with the soil after plowing winter wheat was planted in late september 2020 and harvested in late june 2021 for mulching treatment winter wheat was planted through drilling holes in the plastic film further npff plots were mulched with plastic film after harvest and then the plastic film was manually removed before sowing npfg plots were mulched during the growth period and removed the plastic film after harvesting npfw plots were mulched in the growth period after harvesting the film was removed and re mulching after plowing until next sowing the plastic film used in this study was white transparent polyethylene film with 600 mm wide and 0 015 mm thick during the fallow period for mulching treatment rainfall enters the soifl through the film gaps however during the growth period rainfall enters the soil through the film gaps and planting holes details of the treatments were like those presented by fu et al 2021 and we used data from 2020 2021 in this study 2 3 sampling and measurements we measured soil temperature with a pt1000 platinum thermal resistance and buried the resistances in each plot at a depth of 5 cm 15 cm 30 cm and 50 cm respectively soil temperature was collected every half hour stored in the data collector and then averaged with daily values at wheat harvest soil samples from 0 200 cm were collected with a soil auger inner diameter 5 cm one sample was taken at depth intervals of 10 cm for 0 100 cm and 20 cm for 100 200 cm the soil was quickly removed from each soil layer and collected in an aluminum box and the soil sample was oven dried at 105 c to determine its water content the wheat root was collected by soil auger inner diameter 10 cm during the wheat harvest in 2021 the sampling depth was 200 cm one sample was taken every 10 cm within 0 100 cm and one sample was taken every 20 cm within 100 200 cm two representative sampling points were randomly selected in each plot the collected root samples were rinsed with water and the roots should not be lost during the washing process the root was scanned 300 d p i resolution using a scanner v800 epson suwa japan root overlapping was avoided before scanning after imaging the roots were returned to the envelope and dried at 60 c for approximately 48 h to a constant weight the root images were analyzed using winrhizo pro vision 5 0 software regent instruments inc quebec canada to measure the root morphological parameters including root length and rot tips at harvest we removed two rows of winter wheat that represented marginal effects and randomly selected four consecutive rows from the remaining 22 rows in each plot we then threshed air dried and weighed them to determine grain yield gy and straw yield sy we additionally measured attributes of the spike i e spike length and spike number and grain yield components

and can adjust the growth ability of crops by increasing the surface soil temperature chen et al 2007 sreedevi et al 2017 zhang et al 2009 in the present study by monitoring the soil temperature at the 5 15 30 and 50 cm soil layers during the whole year we found that fm significantly improved the average soil temperature in the 0 50 cm profile by 0 6 c 1 4 c in the whole year table 1 previous studies reported that the soil temperature increased in fm ranged from 0 8 c 2 9 c in different regions he et al 2016 mo et al 2016 these results were similar with our study npfw significantly increased the accumulated soil temperature in the 0 50 cm profile by 13 8 44 9 and 7 0 than np in the seedling stage overwintering stage and regreening stage of winter wheat respectively however the accumulated soil temperature in the 0 50 cm profile of npfw decreased slightly by 2 0 2 5 and 0 6 than np in the jointing stage filling stage and maturity stage of winter wheat respectively fig 5 previous studies indicated that the effect of fm on soil temperature varied with the growth stage of crops that the warming effect in the early stage and the cooling effect in the later stage chen et al 2014 fan et al 2014 the study of deng et al 2019 on maize on the loess plateau demonstrated that fm increased the soil temperature in the jointing stage but decreased soil temperature in the filling and maturity stages our result aligned with those from previous studies the possible reasons are as follows first fm provided higher accumulated soil temperature during wheat s early growth stage which promoted the tiller and reproductive growth of wheat second the shading effects caused by a larger canopy in the later stage of growth reduced the solar radiation reaching the ground surface table 4 in addition npff significantly increased the accumulated soil temperature in the 0 50 cm profile by 13 2 3 2 and 6 4 than np in the fallow period seedling stage and overwintering stage of winter wheat respectively fig 5 unlike conventional mulching measures npff was mulching in the fallow period the high level of precipitation collected by npff before sowing increased the soil water content fig 6 abu hamdeh 2003 proposed that the soil heat capacity increased with increased moisture content as such the soil heat capacity of npff increased in the present study further the accumulated soil temperature in the 0 50 cm profile of npff was higher than np in the fallow period although the plastic film was removed before sowing the higher soil heat capacity may reduce the fluctuation of soil temperature and provide higher accumulated soil temperature in the early stage of wheat growth than that of np fig 5a npfg significantly increased the accumulated soil temperature by 15 5 than np in the 0 50 cm profile during the whole growth period of wheat fig 5 however no cooling effect in the late growth stage of winter wheat of npfg existed which may attribute to the lower lai table 4 which increased the solar radiation on the soil surface dekker and ritsema 1997 zhang et al 2017 the aforementioned results indicated that the seasonal changes of accumulated soil temperature varied with mulching period npfg can provide higher accumulated soil temperature in the 0 50 cm profile during the whole growth period when compared with np however npff and npfw demonstrated a warming effect in the early growth stage and a cooling effect in the late growth stage of winter wheat 4 2 plastic film mulching promoted the soil water condition in the present study three mulching patterns improved wue and rue and the rue of npff and npfw significantly improved by 37 8 and 22 2 than np table 2 our results aligned with existing meta analyses lei et al 2021 ma et al 2018 which demonstrated that the wue of fm increased by 16 2 21 9 on the loess plateau of china where dryland farming has been conducted for thousands of years this is primarily because fm reduced the intense evaporation in the soil surface and collected the rainfall especially in the fallow period resulting in higher wue and rue fu et al 2021 further we found that the sws of npff and npfw in 0 200 cm profile significantly increased by 6 3 30 2 mm and 9 0 43 2 mm before sowing compared with np further the soil water recharging amount of npff and npfw in the 0 200 cm profile significantly increased by 37 2 54 5 mm and 43 7 64 0 mm than np however the soil water recharging amount of npfg was significantly lower than npff and npfw table 2 the possible reason was that traditional mulching measures usually occur in the growth period of plants but npff and npfw had mulching measures both in the growth and fallow periods which effectively collected rainfall and reduced soil evaporation in the fallow period the sws of npfg was higher than np before sowing and the et of npfg significantly decreased by 5 7 thus the sws of npfg in the 0 200 cm profile in harvest was higher than np table 2 it was found that et of npff and npfw increased while that of npfg decreased table 2 previous studies indicated that fm increased et by promoting crop growth and canopy formation gan et al 2013 li et al 2004 our results aligned with these regarding npff and npfw but differed regarding npfg this is primarily because the higher sws before sowing of npff and npfw in this study provided good moisture and temperature conditions to promote crop growth and canopy formation resulting in increased transpiration and et zhang et al 2018 a study of he et al 2016 on the loess plateau on winter wheat indicated that the et of fm in the growth period was influenced by the sws before sowing the lower sws before sowing provided less available soil water supply during the growing season and limited the winter wheat transpiration zhang et al 2007 however npfg decreased et in this study were possibly attributed to the following reasons for one thing the precipitation in the growth period in this study year was 271 6 mm accounting for 50 6 of the annual precipitation fig 1a fm may reduce soil evaporation and increase the collection of small precipitation events 5 mm than no mulching jiang and li 2015 li et al 2001 zhang et al 2013 for another it is possibly due to the lower lai and straw yield of npfg in this study and decreased crop evapotranspiration table 4 in addition the crop coverage and crop coefficient may be affected by mulching measures and the potential crop et calculated according to the fao penman montelth model must also be affected allen et al 1998 el shirbeny et al 2022 valipour 2017 because we only considered et from the perspective of water balance it is necessary for us to accurately calculate the potential crop et according to the variation of crop coefficient in future research 4 3 plastic film mulching promoted the growth of wheat roots our study demonstrated that fm improved the root mass root length root tip and specific root length in the 0 200 cm profile table 3 in the same region the study of zhang et al 2022 on winter wheat and the study of gao et al 2014 on maize showed that fm promoted root growth and improved the root length density in the soil profile the results were similar to ours these may be related to the improvement of soil moisture and temperature conditions by fm qin et al 2018 in the present study fm increased the root percentage in the deep soil layer 40 200 cm and the root mass of npff and npfg in the 0 40 cm soil layer fig 7c however the root mass of npfw significantly decreased in 0 40 cm soil layer fig 7b the study of clarkson et al 2000 has shown that roots would be concentrated in topsoil in good soil water conditions and grow deep into the soil in bad water conditions additionally li et al 2021 also found that fm improved the root trait in the low rainfall 450 mm year in arid and semiarid regions but the root trait promoting effects of fm were reduced in the upper soil layer and possibly enhanced in the deeper layers similar results were found by li et al 2018a the annual rainfall in this study in 2020 2021 was 537 2 mm which was a normal year in this region there was a lesser soil moisture difference between np and fm fm not only increased the root biomass but also promoted root extension to deep soil xu et al 2016 zhang et al 2022 in addition a meta analysis of fm on root traits and yield showed that the roots in the upper soil layer had a strong positive correlation with yield li et al 2021 the study of wang et al 2014 on wheat also demonstrated that the winter wheat yield was strongly positively correlated with root weight mass density in 20 40 and 40 60 cm soil layers in the present study however root mass in the 0 40 cm soil layer of npfg and npff were positively correlated with grain yield while npfw was negatively correlated with grain yield further the yield of npfw is higher than np but the root mass decreased in the 0 40 cm soil layer fig 7b table 4 it is possibly because the root in deep soil layer absorbed an increased level of soil water and nutrients ultimately increasing crop yield xie et al 2005 4 4 plastic film mulching promoted the growth of winter wheat wheat yields under npff npfg and npfw were 37 1 7 8 and 21 3 higher than np table 4 the study of chen et al 2015 on the loess plateau showed that fm in the growth period significantly increased the wheat yield by 18 0 from 2008 2009 another field experiment from 2009 2010 on the loess plateau also showed that fm in the whole year promoted the winter wheat yield by 15 1 he et al 2018 this may be related to the fact that fm promotes crop growth and yield formation in semiarid rain fed areas by adjusting soil water and temperature conditions he et al 2016 li et al 2001 zhang et al 2013 2018 additionally the wheat yield under fm also varied with annual precipitation a regional evaluation of fm on the loess plateau indicated that the yield of fm averagely increased by 66 0 with precipitation less than 600 mm while the yield increased only 20 0 with precipitation greater than 600 mm zhang et al 2018 the study of he et al 2018 showed that fm lost the capacity to improve yield by increasing soil water primarily because the precipitation from 2011 2012 and 2013 2014 were more than 700 mm from 2012 2013 the 447 mm annual precipitation still resulted in reduced grain yield in fm given that less rainfall 47 mm during the vegetative period exacerbated water stress and affected canopy growth in the present study the annual precipitation was 537 2 mm 600 mm 265 6 mm in the fallow period and 271 6 mm in the growth period which was close to the 2016 2021 average rainfall values annual 598 6 mm fallow period 312 4 mm growth period 286 3 mm fig 1b therefore the results of this study can be used to reflect the actual situation of fm in the local area and can be applied to similar climate regions in the present study npfg had the minimum grain yield in three fm measures several possible explanations for this observation exist 1 the accumulated soil temperature of npfg in the regreening stage was significantly higher than npff and npfw and thus the warming effect at this stage had a negative influence on spike number and grain yield figs 3 and 8 2 positive correlation was found in our study between grain yield and the profile s average accumulated soil temperature in the fallow period fig 8 but npfg had no mulching measures in the fallow period and the profile s average accumulated soil temperature in the fallow period of npfg was significantly lower than npff and npfw fig 5b and 3 the highest r s was found in npfg in our study and grain yield was negatively correlated with r s given that more nutrients in this treatment were used for root growth rather than shoot growth figs 3 and 8 in this study npff and npfw collected the precipitation in the fallow period and they had higher sws than np and npfg before sowing but npff showed a higher grain yield than npfw tables 2 and 4 the result may attribute to the following reasons for one thing the profile s average accumulated soil temperature in the seedling stage of npff was significantly improved than np which promoted wheat germination and the lower the profile s average accumulated soil temperature in the regreening stage of npff than npfw produced a higher spike number than npfw figs 5a and 8 table 4 for another the suitable soil moisture and temperature conditions in npfw produced excessive vegetation growth li et al 2018b thereby influenced grain yield table 4 the aboveground and belowground biomass allocation of crops was reflected by r s li et al 2015 in the present study the r s of npff and npfw decreased while that of npfg increased indicating that npff and npfw promote shoot growth and npfg promoted root growth possibly due to the good soil temperature conditions of npfg from overwintering to maturity stages fig 8 the profile s annual average soil temperature sws in june 2021 wue rue root mass grain yield straw yield harvest index and lai were chosen to calculate bi table 4 the results showed that fm increased the bi value and npff was the largest 9 7 which indicates that the effect of fm on soil warming water retention root growth and yield improvement in this region was better than that in the no mulching condition and npff was the best choice 4 5 correlation analysis it is found that grain yield was positively correlated with the profile s average soil temperature in the fallow period r 0 844 p 0 05 and the profile s average accumulated soil temperature in the fallow period r 0 837 p 0 05 while negatively correlated with the profile s average accumulated soil temperature in the jointing stage r 0 706 p 0 05 and filling stage r 0 735 p 0 05 fig 8 these results indicated that the high accumulated soil temperature in the fallow period was beneficial to obtain higher grain yield while the high accumulated soil temperature in the jointing and filling stages may reduce the grain yield the following reasons may contribute to these results for one thing the higher soil accumulated temperature during the fallow period primarily occurred in npff and npfw treatments both of them had higher soil water content this higher moisture content may reduce the soil temperature fluctuation store parts of heat for seed germination and promote a yield increase for another the jointing and filling stages of winter wheat occurred in periods of high air temperature as such the higher soil temperature in these periods was bound to produce heat stress on crops and prevent wheat growth chakraborty et al 2008 fan et al 2012a grain yield was positively correlated with soil water recharging amount r 0 851 p 0 05 and soil water consumption amount r 0 706 p 0 05 fig 8 these results indicated that the rainfall collected in the fallow period and the higher water consumption amount during the growth period were beneficial to yield increases as local farmers said good harvests of winter wheat from stored soil water in the last year the study of zhang et al 2013 also demonstrated that presowing soil water is as vital as in season precipitation for wheat yield in addition for fm treatments the soil evaporation during the growth period can be neglected crop transpiration was the main form of soil water consumption and higher transpiration promotes the formation of dry matter and thus the higher water consumption produced higher grain yield in this study the spike number was negatively correlated with average accumulated soil temperature in the regreening stage r 0 804 p 0 05 jointing stage r 0 939 p 0 05 filling stage r 0 961 p 0 05 and maturity stage r 0 981 p 0 05 fig 8 these results are consistent with the results of previous study that determined that the cooling effect of mulching from overwintering stage to the maturity stage significantly promoted the formation of spike number li et al 2021 in addition the study of maas et al 1994 proposed that the grain yield of winter wheat showed a positive linear correlation with spike number which was the best explanation for the positive correlation between grain yield and spike number in the present study 4 6 implications and expectations of the study in recent years many agricultural management methods have been explored to increase food production in dry areas akpinar ferrand and cecunjanin 2014 zhao et al 2014 fm has been considered the most suitable and effective measure to increase production in arid and semiarid areas fan and xie 2012b ingman et al 2015 based on previous studies this study proposed that mulching during the fallow period of winter wheat may improve the potential of fm to increase crop yields in the present study the grain yield of npff npfg and npfw were significantly higher than np and the grain yield of npff and npfw were 27 2 1424 1 kg ha 1 and 12 5 657 0 kg ha 1 higher than npfg table 4 in addition the correlation analysis in this study demonstrated that fm during the fallow period ensured a high winter wheat yield by increasing soil moisture condition before sowing increasing soil accumulated temperature in the seedling stage and decreasing soil accumulated temperature in the late growth stage of winter wheat fig 8 we believe that this study provides a new method to increase crop production on the loess plateau of china and similar climate regions and is also to solving the global food shortage although fm is of great significance for the improvement of global food production it also brings undeniable environmental problems li et al 2022 the plastic film residual is difficult to remove and decompose and its accumulation is harmful to soil health crop growth as well as food safety huang et al 2020 ng et al 2018 rochman 2018 therefore if biodegradable plastic film is to replace ordinary plastic film it will be more conducive to the sustainable development of fm in the fallow period in addition the mulching period affected soil moisture and temperature conditions which will inevitably affect soil microbial activities and nutrient transformation thus further research must be conducted regarding these aspects in the future 5 conclusion fm in the fallow period the growth period and the whole year was beneficial for increasing winter wheat grain yield increasing water use efficiency increasing rainfall use efficiency increasing the profile s average soil temperature promoting root growth and promoting the downward extension of the root system fm in the fallow period growth period and whole year significantly increased the winter wheat yield by 37 1 1802 5 kg ha 1 7 8 378 4 kg ha 1 and 21 3 1035 4 kg ha 1 respectively than no mulching p 0 05 the wue of fm in the fallow period growth period and whole year were 29 5 14 3 and 12 5 higher than no mulching respectively additionally the rue of fm in the fallow period growth period and whole year were 37 8 8 9 and 22 2 greater than no mulching respectively fm in the fallow period growth period and whole year increased the profile s annual average soil temperature significantly by 5 4 0 6 c 9 0 1 0 c and 12 6 1 4 c than no mulching the root length of fm in the fallow period growth period and whole year significantly increased by 13 9 91 1 and 46 5 than no mulching the root tip of fm in the fallow period growth period and whole year were 66 0 68 0 and 56 0 higher than no mulching the root mass of fm in the fallow period growth period and whole year significantly increased by 16 7 0 2 g 41 7 0 5 g and 8 3 0 1 g than no mulching the root mass percentage of fm in the fallow period growth period and whole year were significantly decreased by 7 3 6 0 and 24 8 than np in the 0 40 cm soil layer respectively p 0 05 in addition fm during the fallow period was considered as the most suitable mulching measure for the loess plateau of china and similar regions because this measure can effectively collect the precipitation in the fallow period accurately adjust the soil temperature to provide suitable soil temperature guarantee for the growth of wheat at each stage and obtain the
