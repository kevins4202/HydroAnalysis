17590,the impoundment of dammed rivers accelerates phytoplankton succession from river dominated to lake dominated species little is known about the role of phytoplankton succession in methane ch4 production in this study we performed a 61 day microcosm investigation to simulate the collapse processes of cyclotella meneghiniana river dominated algae and chlorella pyrenoidosa and microcystis aeruginosa lake dominated algae the results suggested that different methanogenic conditions were induced by the collapse of river and lake dominated algae the rapid settlement of c meneghiniana induced aerobic conditions in the water that inhibited anaerobic ch4 production and intensified ch4 oxidation as a result of an increase in pmoa however the decomposition of c pyrenoidosa and m aeruginosa depleted dissolved oxygen and provided abundant labile organic matter which jointly elevated mcra and the mcra pmoa ratio under this condition anaerobic ch4 production was the dominant pathway for the mineralization of algae derived carbon finally the ch4 produced per unit of particulate total carbon identified as the carbon content of the algal biomass by c pyrenoidosa and m aeruginosa was 16 29 fold and 8 56 fold higher respectively than that produced by c meneghiniana these observations provided evidence that lake dominated algae played a more vital role in ch4 production than river dominated algae when algal succession occurred this discovery might be a new and vital yet largely underestimated ch4 emission pathway in river reservoir systems that should be considered when evaluating the effect of hydraulic projects on greenhouse gas emissions graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords methane algal successions algal blooms oxygen levels labile organic matter 1 introduction global warming is exacerbated by increasing greenhouse gas ghg emissions pall et al 2011 methane ch4 is a potent ghg that has contributed to approximately 20 of global warming since preindustrial times kirschke et al 2013 to reduce global carbon emissions efforts have been made in many areas such as using electric vehicles rodrigues teixeira and sodre 2018 and constructing hydropower dams instead of thermal power plants li et al 2018 although dams created for artificial reservoirs provide beneficial services to human beings according to the life cycle assessments of the construction and operation of hydro projects dammed reservoirs are assumed to be hot spots of ch4 emissions li et al 2018 deemer et al 2016 barros et al 2011 this reduces the green credentials of hydropower a recent estimation suggested that 104 teragrams of ch4 accounting for 20 of the global ch4 emissions are emitted annually by large hydropower dams and dammed reservoirs kumar et al 2019 and these emissions are regulated by multiple pathways the degassing emissions caused by dam turbines and spillways are regarded as a major contributor to ch4 emissions a previous study documented that this pathway leads to 70 of the total ch4 emissions from a hydroelectric reservoir brazil s tucuruí dam fearnside 2002 accompanying the establishment of reservoirs organic carbon sources from flowing rivers plants and plankton continuously settle and accumulate in front of dams rosa et al 2004 where they can be utilized in methanogenic processes another study confirmed that the accumulation of organic matter and the periodic alteration of water level fluctuation zones contributed to the generation of ghgs hao et al 2019 moreover with the increase in water levels caused by damming in river reservoir systems water stratification and mixing occur down the water column the microenvironment particularly oxygen levels at the sediment water interface can be substantially regulated yang et al 2017 shaping the composition of microbial communities in the reservoir yu et al 2014 consequently organic carbon from plant residues and sediments in water level fluctuation zones can be anaerobically decomposed to ch4 as a result of the triggered anaerobic conditions the estimated ghg emissions data from reservoirs according to the main pathways that are currently known are provided in table 1 in addition dams can cut off the continuity of water bodies and alter environmental conditions of natural rivers conditions such as the contents of nutrients e g carbon nitrogen phosphorus energy sources e g temperature light water residence times and hydrodynamic conditions briones hidrovo et al 2020 all influence the succession of phytoplankton communities in dammed reservoirs wang et al 2019 tang et al 2018 xiao et al 2011 long term investigations have demonstrated that the periodic operation of reservoirs can result in the succession of the dominant phytoplankton from river dominated e g diatom and or dinoflagellates to lake dominated e g green algae and or cyanobacteria species in reservoirs and their tributaries tang et al 2018 yang et al 2016 domingues et al 2007 phytoplankton can impose a potential impact on the production of ghgs deemer et al 2016 it is well accepted that the collapse of dense cyanobacteria blooms can lead to a rapid consumption of dissolved oxygen do at the sediment water interface west et al 2012 yan et al 2017 additionally a massive amount of algae derived organic matter aom is released into the water from decaying cyanobacteria xue et al 2017 creating an anaerobic and nutrient rich environment recently both laboratory and field studies have confirmed that the collapse of the cyanobacterial biomass could elevate the production of ch4 yan et al 2017 2019 however it should be noted that during the collapse of algal blooms the varied content and characteristics of the extracellular organic matter of different algal species xiao et al 2019 xiao and zheng 2016 likely lead to differential ghg production previous studies have revealed that refractory organic matter which methanogens have difficulty utilizing were more abundant in diatoms river dominated algae than in microcystis lake dominated algae hanamachi et al 2008 fukami et al 1985 the potential impact of phytoplankton successions triggered by river damming on ghg production has not been adequately considered therefore information needed to estimate the ghg budget resulting from hydraulic projects with this in mind in this study we used microcosm systems to simulate the collapse of cyclotella meneghiniana river dominated algae chlorella pyrenoidosa and microcystis aeruginosa lake dominated algae we investigated the ch4 and co2 production during the collapse of the algal blooms the dynamics of the algal cell density the water environmental parameters and carbon content we also assessed alterations in the microorganism communities especially those involved in ch4 production the aim of the present study was to 1 determine amounts and fluxes of ch4 production from the three phytoplankton 2 reveal the decomposition of phytoplankton induced by alteration of the microenvironment and 3 decipher the potential mechanism underlying ch4 production the results of this study provide new insight into sources and amounts of ch4 production due to river damming and alterations in phytoplankton community structure and function 2 materials and methods 2 1 algae incubation c meneghiniana which was frequently recorded in river c pyrenoidosa and m aeruginosa the most dominant phytoplankton in lake and reservoir ecosystems table s1 were used in this study c meneghiniana fachb 1655 c pyrenoidosa fachb 27 and

significant differences between each treatment were tested by one way analysis of variance anova 3 results 3 1 algal cell density and environmental parameters the algal cell density in the controls was stable during the incubation period accompanied by slight variations in orp and do levels maintained at 219 5 mv and 7 03 mg l 1 respectively during the 61 day incubation fig 2 a b and c at the end of incubation the algal cell densities in the overlying water were gradually reduced by 99 72 and 99 67 for c pyrenoidosa and m aeruginosa respectively which exhibited similar rates of reduction compared with the two lake dominated algae the density of c meneghiniana in the overlying water showed a rapid decrease 97 45 on day 5 as a result of rapid diatom cell settlement fig 2a the distinct dynamics of algal cell density led to different water environments among the different treatments the orp value and do concentration in the c pyrenoidosa and m aeruginosa added treatments showed an obvious decrease after a slight increase as a result of algal cell decomposition the orp value decreased drastically to below approximately 100 mv on day 17 and the trend lasted until day 47 and day 44 in the c pyrenoidosa and m aeruginosa added treatments respectively this was associated with a relatively reduced do level fig 2b concomitantly the do in the water column was nearly exhausted on day 23 as a result of the collapse of lake dominated algal blooms and it was maintained at nearly 0 70 mg l 1 on day 61 indicating hypoxic conditions fig 2c in contrast stable do concentrations and orp values were observed in the c meneghiniana added treatments maintained at 232 7 mv and 7 08 mg l 1 respectively during the 61 day incubation fig 2b and c resulting in aerobic conditions in the water which shared a similar pattern with that of the controls the ph values were in the range of 7 74 8 63 in the controls and c meneghiniana added treatments moreover the addition of m aeruginosa induced a higher ph value than that of c pyrenoidosa but an abrupt ph decrease was observed for the lake dominated algae added treatments with the extension of the study the ph values were maintained at 7 67 and 7 55 in the c pyrenoidosa and m aeruginosa added treatments after day 17 respectively which were significantly lower than those in the c meneghiniana added treatments p 0 01 fig 2d 3 2 algae derived organic matter in the overlying water and the vertical stc concentration the ptc in the overlying water reached peak values of 31 04 35 43 and 29 39 mg l 1 in the c pyrenoidosa m aeruginosa and c meneghiniana added treatments respectively because of the addition of algal biomass the ptc displayed a similar trend of a linear reduction in the c pyrenoidosa and m aeruginosa added treatments fig 3 a indicating the decomposition of lake dominated algal cells in the c meneghiniana added treatments an abrupt decrease in ptc was observed before day 5 as a result of the rapid settlement of diatom cells and silicic theca accompanied by the decrease in ptc a large amount of doc was rapidly released into the aquatic systems before day 23 which may imply the metabolism of the algal cells by microorganisms the doc concentration was maintained at 3 69 4 28 and 3 95 mg l 1 in the c pyrenoidosa m aeruginosa and c meneghiniana added treatments respectively on day 61 fig 3b the dynamics of the dtc concentration in the c meneghiniana treatment group shared a similar trend with that of the doc concentration but the dtc concentration in the c pyrenoidosa and m aeruginosa added treatments increased continuously during the experimental period fig 3c moreover after 61 days of incubation the settlement of algal cells in the water led to an increase in the stc in the 10 mm sediment surface layer from 19 13 mg g 1 initial stc concentration to 19 70 19 78 and 20 35 mg g 1 in the c pyrenoidosa m aeruginosa and c meneghiniana added treatments respectively which was contrary to the decrease in stc to 17 50 mg g 1 in the controls fig 3d the stc concentration in the 10 mm surface layer of the sediment in the c meneghiniana added treatments was significantly higher than that in the other treatments p 0 05 indicating that more algal cells in the c meneghiniana added treatments were deposited on the surface sediments than in the other algae addition treatments 3 3 fluxes of ch4 and co2 at the water air interface distinct ch4 and co2 fluxes at the water air interface among the algae added treatments were observed during the incubation period the water environment in the c pyrenoidosa and m aeruginosa added treatments showed an anaerobic and reductive state due to the collapse of dense algal blooms especially from days 29 to 44 which contributed to the anaerobic decomposition of aom as a result the ch4 and co2 fluxes displayed a dramatic increase and reached maximum values during this period specifically the ch4 and co2 levels reached 15 49 μmol ch4 dm 2 d 1 and 43 75 μmol co2 dm 2 d 1 in the c pyrenoidosa added treatments on days 41 and 38 respectively and 7 36 μmol ch4 dm 2 d 1 and 44 43 μmol co2 dm 2 d 1 in the m aeruginosa added treatments on days 31 and 41 respectively fig 4 in contrast an aerobic state was maintained in the overlying water during the collapse of the c meneghiniana bloom which was not beneficial to methanogens or ch4 production the aerobic state of the overlying water resulted in a slightly higher ch4 flux in the c meneghiniana added treatments than in the controls in the c meneghiniana added treatments the co2 flux exhibited a rapid increase due to the aerobic decomposition of aom and reached the peak value of 58 09 μmol co2 dm 2 d 1 on day 35 fig 4 however it should be noted that the peak fluxes of ch4 in the c pyrenoidosa and m aeruginosa added treatments were almost 13 3 fold and 6 3 fold higher than that in the c meneghiniana added treatments respectively however the maximum flux of co2 in the c meneghiniana added treatments was almost 1 3 fold higher than that in the c pyrenoidosa and m aeruginosa added treatments fig 4 demonstrating that the decomposition of lake dominated algae contributed much more ch4 than river dominated algae and less co2 3 4 changes in the microorganism communities and abundance of the mcra gene and pmoa gene the collapse of algal blooms altered the microorganism communities as the nonmetric multidimensional scaling nmds analysis revealed compared with the c meneghiniana added treatments the changes in the microorganism communities in the c pyrenoidosa and m aeruginosa added treatments were more similar both in water and sediment after 61 days of incubation fig s1 it was obvious that there were abundant niveispirillum polynucleobacter methylotenera acidovorax opitutus and flavobacterium in the water of the c pyrenoidosa added treatments and a large amount of opitutus and acidovorax was observed in the water of the m aeruginosa added treatments on day 61 fig 5 moreover the relative abundance of niveispirillum and polynucleobacter increased in the water of the c meneghiniana added treatments on day 61 moreover the relative abundance of novosphingobium was enhanced in all three algae addition treatments and that of rhodobacter was reduced in the surface sediment an increased abundance of acidovorax and a reduced abundance of sphingomonas and novosphingobium were observed in all three algae added treatments on day 61 concomitantly compared with that in the initial surface sediment the relative abundance of rhodobacter and flavobacterium was enriched in the surface sediment of the c pyrenoidosa and m aeruginosa added treatments but it was reduced in the surface sediment of the c meneghiniana added treatments at the end of incubation fig 5 the relative abundance of methanogens at the genus level showed a great difference between treatments methanosarcina methanoregula and methanosaeta were initially found to dominate the surface sediment in this study as shown in table 2 after 61 days of incubation in the surface sediment of the c pyrenoidosa and m aeruginosa added treatments unclassified f methanobacteriaceae accounting for 6 49 and 10 09 respectively methanospirillum accounting for 15 58 and 6 42 respectively methanobacterium accounting for 9 09 and 5 50 respectively and methanoregula accounting for 22 08 and 39 45 respectively were the dominant genera in addition the relative abundance of methanosaeta accounting for 3 90 and 3 67 respectively was greatly reduced however the opposite results were observed in the surface sediment of the c meneghiniana added treatments therefore the composition and diversity of methanogens was obviously distinct between the collapse of lake dominated and river dominated blooms moreover methylosarcina methylomonas and methylobacter which are aerobic methanotrophs were found in the surface sediments of all the treatments the relative abundances of methylosarcina methylomonas and methylobacter in the microbial population were 0 30 0 25 and 0 23 in the c meneghiniana added treatments respectively which were higher than in the c pyrenoidosa and m aeruginosa added treatments table 2 the variation in methanogens and methanotrophs was also evaluated by qpcr analysis fig 6 after 61 days of incubation the mcra gene copy numbers of the c meneghiniana added treatments slightly increased with 3 20 106 copies g 1 sediment the mcra gene copy numbers of the c pyrenoidosa and m aeruginosa added treatments were significantly larger than those of the controls and the c meneghiniana added treatments with 1 38 107 and 8 39 106 copies g 1 sediment respectively fig 6a the pmoa copy numbers were very low at the end of incubation compared with that of the initial sediment the pmoa gene copy numbers of the c meneghiniana added treatments increased by 23 06 while the pmoa gene copy numbers of the c meneghiniana added treatments increased by 39 39 and 56 85 respectively fig 6b moreover the mcra pmoa ratio of the sediment from the c pyrenoidosa and m aeruginosa added treatments was 8 87 fold and 7 45 fold higher than that of the sediment from the c meneghiniana added treatments respectively fig 6c therefore more ch4 production was observed in the c pyrenoidosa and m aeruginosa added treatments which was reflected in variations in the mcra and pmoa gene copy numbers 4 discussion the methanogenesis process is the result of a complex set of microbial activities such as fermentative microorganisms and methanogens and it is regulated by various factors for which the do level rey sanchez et al 2018 lew and glinska lewczuk 2018 and the availability of carbon substrate gudasz et al 2010 are essential when the collapse of algal blooms occurs in freshwater bodies alterations in environmental conditions such as do consumption and increased organic matter can shape the bacterial community and this in turn affects the methanogenesis process liu et al 2019b yan et al 2019 in the present study the collapse of river dominated and lake dominated algal blooms triggered distinct chemical and biological conditions and played distinct roles in ch4 production the final ch4 production per unit ptc in the c pyrenoidosa and m aeruginosa added treatments was almost 16 29 fold and 8 56 fold higher than that in the c meneghiniana added treatments respectively fig s2 4 1 decomposition of lake dominated algae created severe anaerobic condition previous studies found that collapses of dense algal blooms could lead to rapid consumption of do at the sediment water interface and a massive release of aom creating an anaerobic and nutrient rich environment west et al 2012 yan et al 2017 grasset et al 2018 in the present study with the collapse of c pyrenoidosa and m aeruginosa blooms the decomposition and utilization of aom by heterotrophic microorganisms exhausted the do resulting in a dramatic reduction in the water do concentration and orp fig 2b and c these findings were consistent with results from previous studies that found an anaerobic and reductive environment in water yan et al 2017 and this condition was favorable for the growth and activity of methanogens and ch4 production hao et al 2019 stanley et al 2016 moreover decreased ph values in the c pyrenoidosa and m aeruginosa added treatments might be associated with the enhanced production of organic acids during the anaerobic decomposition of aom such as short chain fatty acids duan et al 2019 kim et al 2019 and these short chain fatty acids were potential substrates for ch4 production when this happened large amounts of aom that were released from lake dominated algae decomposition would be mineralized to ch4 because ch4 is the final product in the mineralization of anaerobic organic matter the present results supported this and showed that the maximum ch4 flux was recorded in the c pyrenoidosa and m aeruginosa added treatments when the carbon substrate content determined by the doc concentration fig 3b peaked and the do was nearly exhausted from day 23 to 41 in contrast during the collapse of c meneghiniana blooms the diatom cells were more prone to settle on the surface of sediments as a result of the activity of the silicified cell wall in the diatom xiao and zheng 2016 fukami et al 1985 kroeger and poulsen 2008 leading to the migration of aom to the water bottom and sediment and an increase in the stc concentrations fig 3d in contrast to the do profile in the c pyrenoidosa and m aeruginosa added treatments the adhesion growth of c meneghiniana resulted in stable do levels 8 50 6 42 mg l 1 from day 14 to 61 fig 2c cao et al 2013 hence the aerobic environment in the overlying water promoted the mineralization of organic matter into co2 liikanen et al 2003 which eventually caused a higher co2 flux and lower ch4 flux during the decomposition of c meneghiniana overall after the algal succession from river dominated species to lake dominated species algal collapses caused anaerobic methanogenesis conditions which induced the mineralization of aom to ch4 4 2 methane production regulated by the availability and diversity of algae derived methanogenic substrates algal blooms have been shown to influence the dynamics of doc in freshwater ecosystems liu et al 2019b in the present study the settlement and decay of three studied phytoplankton species was accompanied by obvious changes in the carbon composition in the water column after 61 days of incubation the ptc displayed a decrease of 83 33 95 31 and the doc concentrations displayed a 1 53 fold to 4 92 fold increase the release of a large amount of fresh carbon substrate provided abundant substrates for ch4 production as a result the bioavailable substrate could be utilized by anaerobic methanogens and this contributed to ch4 production this was demonstrated in the finding that a positive correlation existed between the ch4 flux and doc concentration in the water fig s3 and this was also supported by the previous studies stanley et al 2016 liang et al 2016 however available studies have suggested that fluxes of ch4 vary during collapses of the bloom composed of different algae species west et al 2012 yan et al 2017 grasset et al 2018 this may be partly attributed to the different components of aom in the different species in freshwater the rate of ch4 production not only is related to the available organic matter but also is closely linked to the properties of the organic matter borrel et al 2011 the decomposition of algal cells releases abundant labile organic matter including polysaccharides and protein li et al 2020 fermentative microorganisms utilize labile algal carbon to produce acetate methyl group containing compounds and co2 h2 which are the available substrates for methanogens chen et al 2016 ye et al 2012 eryildiz et al 2020 the availability of labile algal carbon varies during the collapse of blooms in the present study the collapse of c pyrenoidosa and m aeruginosa blooms enhanced the release of polysaccharides and proteins which could be converted easily into methanogenic substrates and promote the growth of methanogens rathi et al 2019 moreover the proportion of simple aromatic proteins and soluble microbial byproduct like material released by the decomposition of c pyrenoidosa and m aeruginosa was significantly higher than that of c meneghiniana with the extension of the incubation fig s5 p 0 05 this result suggested that the increase in the labile organic matter was contributed to by the lake dominated algae under this condition the anaerobic microenvironment facilitated mineralization of organic matter to ch4 by many species of bacteria in the c pyrenoidosa and m aeruginosa added treatments therefore during the collapse of c pyrenoidosa and m aeruginosa blooms it was likely that the increased labile algal carbon content was a key factor in promoting ch4 production however the concentrations of polysaccharides and proteins were maintained at low levels during the incubation of c meneghiniana indicating that a small amount of substrates was provided to support the methanogenesis processes this results was in agreement with the lower ch4 production at the end of c meneghiniana added treatments fig s4 moreover the proportion of released humic acid like organics which were regarded as the limiting factors of ch4 production minderlein and blodau 2010 was observed to be higher in the c meneghiniana added treatments than in the c pyrenoidosa and m aeruginosa added treatments fig s5 this indicated that the composition of refractory substrates released during the decomposition of c meneghiniana cells might impair ch4 production therefore the availability and diversity of methanogenic substrates regulated the ch4 production during the collapse of river and lake dominated algae 4 3 decomposition of lake dominated algae benefited methanogens but impaired methanotrophs organic carbon plays a crucial role in shaping the bacterial community structure during algal collapses xue et al 2017 in turn bloom associated bacterial populations are important contributors in transforming aom methanogens constitute a highly specialized metabolic group of microorganisms and can utilize a restricted number of substrates such as h2 co2 ethanol and acetate to produce ch4 in anaerobic sediments eryildiz et al 2020 conrad 2009 their activity and abundance can substantially manipulate ch4 production several studies have reported that the collapse of dense cyanobacterial blooms contributes to a large shift in the structure and diversity of the microorganism community berry et al 2017 horner devine et al 2003 few studies however have been conducted that assess the response of methanogens and methanotrophs involved in ghg production to algal succession from river dominated algae to lake dominated algae in this study the relative abundances of unclassified f methanobacteriaceae methanospirillum methanobacterium and methanoregula in the sediment of the c pyrenoidosa and m aeruginosa added treatments were greatly enhanced after 61 days of incubation which agreed well with the outcomes concerning the abundance of the mcra gene in the two treatments the mcra gene was expressed in both hydrogenotrophic and acetoclastic methanogens hunger et al 2016 with the optimum growth conditions ph and do level and adequate labile organic matter ch4 production by methanogens was favored in the c pyrenoidosa and m aeruginosa added treatments moreover the mcra copy numbers and mcra pmoa ratio decreased in the sediment of the c meneghiniana added treatments which led to much lower ch4 production in the c meneghiniana treatments than in the other treatments in addition in this study methanotrophs which utilized ch4 as their sole carbon and energy source ho et al 2019 were found in the surface sediment of all algae added treatments after 61 days of incubation the relative abundance of methanotrophs and the pmoa copy numbers in the sediment of the c meneghiniana added treatments were nearly 2 to 3 fold higher than that in the c pyrenoidosa and m aeruginosa added treatments this suggested that the emitted ch4 could be further reduced as a result of oxidation by methanotrophs in the c meneghiniana added treatments 4 4 environmental implications despite the green credentials of hydropower reservoirs reservoirs formed by impoundments in dammed rivers have been considered to be hot spots of ch4 emissions because this activity is believed to be capable of accumulating organic material and producing water level fluctuation zones in rivers brandao et al 2019 wilkinson et al 2019 as a result a recent study reported that 104 teragrams of ch4 accounting for 20 of the total emissions is emitted annually by large hydropower dams and dammed reservoirs kumar et al 2019 however it should be noted that with the alteration of hydrodynamic properties in rivers the successions of phytoplankton can be substantially modified inducing the phytoplankton succession from river dominated algae to lake dominated algae therefore reservoir water with high primary productivity may result in high ch4 emissions deemer et al 2016 in fact the occurrence of algal blooms with the alteration of river dominated algae to lake dominated algae frequently has been reported in dammed rivers as well as in their tributaries nevertheless few studies have evaluated the potential role of phytoplankton succession in ch4 production this microcosm study found that the ch4 production in treatments that simulated the blooms of lake dominated algae c pyrenoidosa and m aeruginosa was much higher than that in the treatment simulating the bloom of river dominated algae c meneghiniana which primarily was due to the distinct water environment and diversified carbon substrate these results provided evidence that when accompanied by algal succession dammed rivers suffering from blooms of lake dominated algae could produce elevated levels of ch4 which increased the contribution of rivers to ghg production and further aggravated climate warming although this current study confirmed the underevaluated role of phytoplankton succession in ch4 production and identified the potential approaches that underlie the distinct ch4 production amount in dammed rivers the ch4 emissions at the water air interface were also closely related to the transformation and migration processes in the water column due to complex physicochemical factors in real world flowing rivers and dammed reservoirs therefore further investigations are required to explore the contribution of phytoplankton succession to total annual ch4 emission the multiple processes of the collapse of river dominated and lake dominated algal blooms and the relationships between algal succession and climate warming are illustrated in fig 7 the ghg ch4 and co2 emissions from algal blooms could intensify the greenhouse effect and they were enhanced during the collapse of lake dominated algal blooms concomitantly climate warming caused by the greenhouse effect and the release of nutrients n and p during the collapse of algal blooms jointly exacerbated the eutrophication of dammed rivers fig s6 this contributed to algal succession from river dominated algae to lake dominated algae and the frequent occurrence of algal blooms therefore algal successions are a neglected facilitator of ghg production and should be considered in future estimations of ch4 production in dammed rivers 5 conclusions the collapses of lake dominated algae c pyrenoidosa and m aeruginosa blooms played a more vital role in ch4 production than river dominated algae c meneghiniana this difference was attributed to the distinct water environment and diversified carbon substrate an aerobic state in the water was observed during the collapse of a high density c meneghiniana bloom whereas the collapse of c pyrenoidosa and m aeruginosa blooms induced an anaerobic reductive and slightly alkaline environment in the water moreover more labile organics such as proteins and polysaccharides were released into the water during the collapse of c pyrenoidosa and m aeruginosa blooms providing available substrates for methanogens therefore it provided evidence that the phytoplankton succession might be a new and important yet largely underestimated ch4 emission pathway when it occurred in river reservoir systems this should be considered when evaluating the effect of hydraulic projects on ghg emissions the results of this study expanded our knowledge of the general processes and potential mechanisms underlying ch4 production during collapses of river and

17590,the impoundment of dammed rivers accelerates phytoplankton succession from river dominated to lake dominated species little is known about the role of phytoplankton succession in methane ch4 production in this study we performed a 61 day microcosm investigation to simulate the collapse processes of cyclotella meneghiniana river dominated algae and chlorella pyrenoidosa and microcystis aeruginosa lake dominated algae the results suggested that different methanogenic conditions were induced by the collapse of river and lake dominated algae the rapid settlement of c meneghiniana induced aerobic conditions in the water that inhibited anaerobic ch4 production and intensified ch4 oxidation as a result of an increase in pmoa however the decomposition of c pyrenoidosa and m aeruginosa depleted dissolved oxygen and provided abundant labile organic matter which jointly elevated mcra and the mcra pmoa ratio under this condition anaerobic ch4 production was the dominant pathway for the mineralization of algae derived carbon finally the ch4 produced per unit of particulate total carbon identified as the carbon content of the algal biomass by c pyrenoidosa and m aeruginosa was 16 29 fold and 8 56 fold higher respectively than that produced by c meneghiniana these observations provided evidence that lake dominated algae played a more vital role in ch4 production than river dominated algae when algal succession occurred this discovery might be a new and vital yet largely underestimated ch4 emission pathway in river reservoir systems that should be considered when evaluating the effect of hydraulic projects on greenhouse gas emissions graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords methane algal successions algal blooms oxygen levels labile organic matter 1 introduction global warming is exacerbated by increasing greenhouse gas ghg emissions pall et al 2011 methane ch4 is a potent ghg that has contributed to approximately 20 of global warming since preindustrial times kirschke et al 2013 to reduce global carbon emissions efforts have been made in many areas such as using electric vehicles rodrigues teixeira and sodre 2018 and constructing hydropower dams instead of thermal power plants li et al 2018 although dams created for artificial reservoirs provide beneficial services to human beings according to the life cycle assessments of the construction and operation of hydro projects dammed reservoirs are assumed to be hot spots of ch4 emissions li et al 2018 deemer et al 2016 barros et al 2011 this reduces the green credentials of hydropower a recent estimation suggested that 104 teragrams of ch4 accounting for 20 of the global ch4 emissions are emitted annually by large hydropower dams and dammed reservoirs kumar et al 2019 and these emissions are regulated by multiple pathways the degassing emissions caused by dam turbines and spillways are regarded as a major contributor to ch4 emissions a previous study documented that this pathway leads to 70 of the total ch4 emissions from a hydroelectric reservoir brazil s tucuruí dam fearnside 2002 accompanying the establishment of reservoirs organic carbon sources from flowing rivers plants and plankton continuously settle and accumulate in front of dams rosa et al 2004 where they can be utilized in methanogenic processes another study confirmed that the accumulation of organic matter and the periodic alteration of water level fluctuation zones contributed to the generation of ghgs hao et al 2019 moreover with the increase in water levels caused by damming in river reservoir systems water stratification and mixing occur down the water column the microenvironment particularly oxygen levels at the sediment water interface can be substantially regulated yang et al 2017 shaping the composition of microbial communities in the reservoir yu et al 2014 consequently organic carbon from plant residues and sediments in water level fluctuation zones can be anaerobically decomposed to ch4 as a result of the triggered anaerobic conditions the estimated ghg emissions data from reservoirs according to the main pathways that are currently known are provided in table 1 in addition dams can cut off the continuity of water bodies and alter environmental conditions of natural rivers conditions such as the contents of nutrients e g carbon nitrogen phosphorus energy sources e g temperature light water residence times and hydrodynamic conditions briones hidrovo et al 2020 all influence the succession of phytoplankton communities in dammed reservoirs wang et al 2019 tang et al 2018 xiao et al 2011 long term investigations have demonstrated that the periodic operation of reservoirs can result in the succession of the dominant phytoplankton from river dominated e g diatom and or dinoflagellates to lake dominated e g green algae and or cyanobacteria species in reservoirs and their tributaries tang et al 2018 yang et al 2016 domingues et al 2007 phytoplankton can impose a potential impact on the production of ghgs deemer et al 2016 it is well accepted that the collapse of dense cyanobacteria blooms can lead to a rapid consumption of dissolved oxygen do at the sediment water interface west et al 2012 yan et al 2017 additionally a massive amount of algae derived organic matter aom is released into the water from decaying cyanobacteria xue et al 2017 creating an anaerobic and nutrient rich environment recently both laboratory and field studies have confirmed that the collapse of the cyanobacterial biomass could elevate the production of ch4 yan et al 2017 2019 however it should be noted that during the collapse of algal blooms the varied content and characteristics of the extracellular organic matter of different algal species xiao et al 2019 xiao and zheng 2016 likely lead to differential ghg production previous studies have revealed that refractory organic matter which methanogens have difficulty utilizing were more abundant in diatoms river dominated algae than in microcystis lake dominated algae hanamachi et al 2008 fukami et al 1985 the potential impact of phytoplankton successions triggered by river damming on ghg production has not been adequately considered therefore information needed to estimate the ghg budget resulting from hydraulic projects with this in mind in this study we used microcosm systems to simulate the collapse of cyclotella meneghiniana river dominated algae chlorella pyrenoidosa and microcystis aeruginosa lake dominated algae we investigated the ch4 and co2 production during the collapse of the algal blooms the dynamics of the algal cell density the water environmental parameters and carbon content we also assessed alterations in the microorganism communities especially those involved in ch4 production the aim of the present study was to 1 determine amounts and fluxes of ch4 production from the three phytoplankton 2 reveal the decomposition of phytoplankton induced by alteration of the microenvironment and 3 decipher the potential mechanism underlying ch4 production the results of this study provide new insight into sources and amounts of ch4 production due to river damming and alterations in phytoplankton community structure and function 2 materials and methods 2 1 algae incubation c meneghiniana which was frequently recorded in river c pyrenoidosa and m aeruginosa the most dominant phytoplankton in lake and reservoir ecosystems table s1 were used in this study c meneghiniana fachb 1655 c pyrenoidosa fachb 27 and

mixed and passed through a five mesh 2 mm sieve to remove large particulate matter such as gravel and plant residues the overlying water was filtered through whatman gf c filters 0 45 μm to remove phytoplankton from the raw water the initial concentrations of total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp of the raw water were 2 12 and 0 22 mg l 1 respectively then we added the homogenized sediment

significant differences between each treatment were tested by one way analysis of variance anova 3 results 3 1 algal cell density and environmental parameters the algal cell density in the controls was stable during the incubation period accompanied by slight variations in orp and do levels maintained at 219 5 mv and 7 03 mg l 1 respectively during the 61 day incubation fig 2 a b and c at the end of incubation the algal cell densities in the overlying water were gradually reduced by 99 72 and 99 67 for c pyrenoidosa and m aeruginosa respectively which exhibited similar rates of reduction compared with the two lake dominated algae the density of c meneghiniana in the overlying water showed a rapid decrease 97 45 on day 5 as a result of rapid diatom cell settlement fig 2a the distinct dynamics of algal cell density led to different water environments among the different treatments the orp value and do concentration in the c pyrenoidosa and m aeruginosa added treatments showed an obvious decrease after a slight increase as a result of algal cell decomposition the orp value decreased drastically to below approximately 100 mv on day 17 and the trend lasted until day 47 and day 44 in the c pyrenoidosa and m aeruginosa added treatments respectively this was associated with a relatively reduced do level fig 2b concomitantly the do in the water column was nearly exhausted on day 23 as a result of the collapse of lake dominated algal blooms and it was maintained at nearly 0 70 mg l 1 on day 61 indicating hypoxic conditions fig 2c in contrast stable do concentrations and orp values were observed in the c meneghiniana added treatments maintained at 232 7 mv and 7 08 mg l 1 respectively during the 61 day incubation fig 2b and c resulting in aerobic conditions in the water which shared a similar pattern with that of the controls the ph values were in the range of 7 74 8 63 in the controls and c meneghiniana added treatments moreover the addition of m aeruginosa induced a higher ph value than that of c pyrenoidosa but an abrupt ph decrease was observed for the lake dominated algae added treatments with the extension of the study the ph values were maintained at 7 67 and 7 55 in the c pyrenoidosa and m aeruginosa added treatments after day 17 respectively which were significantly lower than those in the c meneghiniana added treatments p 0 01 fig 2d 3 2 algae derived organic matter in the overlying water and the vertical stc concentration the ptc in the overlying water reached peak values of 31 04 35 43 and 29 39 mg l 1 in the c pyrenoidosa m aeruginosa and c meneghiniana added treatments respectively because of the addition of algal biomass the ptc displayed a similar trend of a linear reduction in the c pyrenoidosa and m aeruginosa added treatments fig 3 a indicating the decomposition of lake dominated algal cells in the c meneghiniana added treatments an abrupt decrease in ptc was observed before day 5 as a result of the rapid settlement of diatom cells and silicic theca accompanied by the decrease in ptc a large amount of doc was rapidly released into the aquatic systems before day 23 which may imply the metabolism of the algal cells by microorganisms the doc concentration was maintained at 3 69 4 28 and 3 95 mg l 1 in the c pyrenoidosa m aeruginosa and c meneghiniana added treatments respectively on day 61 fig 3b the dynamics of the dtc concentration in the c meneghiniana treatment group shared a similar trend with that of the doc concentration but the dtc concentration in the c pyrenoidosa and m aeruginosa added treatments increased continuously during the experimental period fig 3c moreover after 61 days of incubation the settlement of algal cells in the water led to an increase in the stc in the 10 mm sediment surface layer from 19 13 mg g 1 initial stc concentration to 19 70 19 78 and 20 35 mg g 1 in the c pyrenoidosa m aeruginosa and c meneghiniana added treatments respectively which was contrary to the decrease in stc to 17 50 mg g 1 in the controls fig 3d the stc concentration in the 10 mm surface layer of the sediment in the c meneghiniana added treatments was significantly higher than that in the other treatments p 0 05 indicating that more algal cells in the c meneghiniana added treatments were deposited on the surface sediments than in the other algae addition treatments 3 3 fluxes of ch4 and co2 at the water air interface distinct ch4 and co2 fluxes at the water air interface among the algae added treatments were observed during the incubation period the water environment in the c pyrenoidosa and m aeruginosa added treatments showed an anaerobic and reductive state due to the collapse of dense algal blooms especially from days 29 to 44 which contributed to the anaerobic decomposition of aom as a result the ch4 and co2 fluxes displayed a dramatic increase and reached maximum values during this period specifically the ch4 and co2 levels reached 15 49 μmol ch4 dm 2 d 1 and 43 75 μmol co2 dm 2 d 1 in the c pyrenoidosa added treatments on days 41 and 38 respectively and 7 36 μmol ch4 dm 2 d 1 and 44 43 μmol co2 dm 2 d 1 in the m aeruginosa added treatments on days 31 and 41 respectively fig 4 in contrast an aerobic state was maintained in the overlying water during the collapse of the c meneghiniana bloom which was not beneficial to methanogens or ch4 production the aerobic state of the overlying water resulted in a slightly higher ch4 flux in the c meneghiniana added treatments than in the controls in the c meneghiniana added treatments the co2 flux exhibited a rapid increase due to the aerobic decomposition of aom and reached the peak value of 58 09 μmol co2 dm 2 d 1 on day 35 fig 4 however it should be noted that the peak fluxes of ch4 in the c pyrenoidosa and m aeruginosa added treatments were almost 13 3 fold and 6 3 fold higher than that in the c meneghiniana added treatments respectively however the maximum flux of co2 in the c meneghiniana added treatments was almost 1 3 fold higher than that in the c pyrenoidosa and m aeruginosa added treatments fig 4 demonstrating that the decomposition of lake dominated algae contributed much more ch4 than river dominated algae and less co2 3 4 changes in the microorganism communities and abundance of the mcra gene and pmoa gene the collapse of algal blooms altered the microorganism communities as the nonmetric multidimensional scaling nmds analysis revealed compared with the c meneghiniana added treatments the changes in the microorganism communities in the c pyrenoidosa and m aeruginosa added treatments were more similar both in water and sediment after 61 days of incubation fig s1 it was obvious that there were abundant niveispirillum polynucleobacter methylotenera acidovorax opitutus and flavobacterium in the water of the c pyrenoidosa added treatments and a large amount of opitutus and acidovorax was observed in the water of the m aeruginosa added treatments on day 61 fig 5 moreover the relative abundance of niveispirillum and polynucleobacter increased in the water of the c meneghiniana added treatments on day 61 moreover the relative abundance of novosphingobium was enhanced in all three algae addition treatments and that of rhodobacter was reduced in the surface sediment an increased abundance of acidovorax and a reduced abundance of sphingomonas and novosphingobium were observed in all three algae added treatments on day 61 concomitantly compared with that in the initial surface sediment the relative abundance of rhodobacter and flavobacterium was enriched in the surface sediment of the c pyrenoidosa and m aeruginosa added treatments but it was reduced in the surface sediment of the c meneghiniana added treatments at the end of incubation fig 5 the relative abundance of methanogens at the genus level showed a great difference between treatments methanosarcina methanoregula and methanosaeta were initially found to dominate the surface sediment in this study as shown in table 2 after 61 days of incubation in the surface sediment of the c pyrenoidosa and m aeruginosa added treatments unclassified f methanobacteriaceae accounting for 6 49 and 10 09 respectively methanospirillum accounting for 15 58 and 6 42 respectively methanobacterium accounting for 9 09 and 5 50 respectively and methanoregula accounting for 22 08 and 39 45 respectively were the dominant genera in addition the relative abundance of methanosaeta accounting for 3 90 and 3 67 respectively was greatly reduced however the opposite results were observed in the surface sediment of the c meneghiniana added treatments therefore the composition and diversity of methanogens was obviously distinct between the collapse of lake dominated and river dominated blooms moreover methylosarcina methylomonas and methylobacter which are aerobic methanotrophs were found in the surface sediments of all the treatments the relative abundances of methylosarcina methylomonas and methylobacter in the microbial population were 0 30 0 25 and 0 23 in the c meneghiniana added treatments respectively which were higher than in the c pyrenoidosa and m aeruginosa added treatments table 2 the variation in methanogens and methanotrophs was also evaluated by qpcr analysis fig 6 after 61 days of incubation the mcra gene copy numbers of the c meneghiniana added treatments slightly increased with 3 20 106 copies g 1 sediment the mcra gene copy numbers of the c pyrenoidosa and m aeruginosa added treatments were significantly larger than those of the controls and the c meneghiniana added treatments with 1 38 107 and 8 39 106 copies g 1 sediment respectively fig 6a the pmoa copy numbers were very low at the end of incubation compared with that of the initial sediment the pmoa gene copy numbers of the c meneghiniana added treatments increased by 23 06 while the pmoa gene copy numbers of the c meneghiniana added treatments increased by 39 39 and 56 85 respectively fig 6b moreover the mcra pmoa ratio of the sediment from the c pyrenoidosa and m aeruginosa added treatments was 8 87 fold and 7 45 fold higher than that of the sediment from the c meneghiniana added treatments respectively fig 6c therefore more ch4 production was observed in the c pyrenoidosa and m aeruginosa added treatments which was reflected in variations in the mcra and pmoa gene copy numbers 4 discussion the methanogenesis process is the result of a complex set of microbial activities such as fermentative microorganisms and methanogens and it is regulated by various factors for which the do level rey sanchez et al 2018 lew and glinska lewczuk 2018 and the availability of carbon substrate gudasz et al 2010 are essential when the collapse of algal blooms occurs in freshwater bodies alterations in environmental conditions such as do consumption and increased organic matter can shape the bacterial community and this in turn affects the methanogenesis process liu et al 2019b yan et al 2019 in the present study the collapse of river dominated and lake dominated algal blooms triggered distinct chemical and biological conditions and played distinct roles in ch4 production the final ch4 production per unit ptc in the c pyrenoidosa and m aeruginosa added treatments was almost 16 29 fold and 8 56 fold higher than that in the c meneghiniana added treatments respectively fig s2 4 1 decomposition of lake dominated algae created severe anaerobic condition previous studies found that collapses of dense algal blooms could lead to rapid consumption of do at the sediment water interface and a massive release of aom creating an anaerobic and nutrient rich environment west et al 2012 yan et al 2017 grasset et al 2018 in the present study with the collapse of c pyrenoidosa and m aeruginosa blooms the decomposition and utilization of aom by heterotrophic microorganisms exhausted the do resulting in a dramatic reduction in the water do concentration and orp fig 2b and c these findings were consistent with results from previous studies that found an anaerobic and reductive environment in water yan et al 2017 and this condition was favorable for the growth and activity of methanogens and ch4 production hao et al 2019 stanley et al 2016 moreover decreased ph values in the c pyrenoidosa and m aeruginosa added treatments might be associated with the enhanced production of organic acids during the anaerobic decomposition of aom such as short chain fatty acids duan et al 2019 kim et al 2019 and these short chain fatty acids were potential substrates for ch4 production when this happened large amounts of aom that were released from lake dominated algae decomposition would be mineralized to ch4 because ch4 is the final product in the mineralization of anaerobic organic matter the present results supported this and showed that the maximum ch4 flux was recorded in the c pyrenoidosa and m aeruginosa added treatments when the carbon substrate content determined by the doc concentration fig 3b peaked and the do was nearly exhausted from day 23 to 41 in contrast during the collapse of c meneghiniana blooms the diatom cells were more prone to settle on the surface of sediments as a result of the activity of the silicified cell wall in the diatom xiao and zheng 2016 fukami et al 1985 kroeger and poulsen 2008 leading to the migration of aom to the water bottom and sediment and an increase in the stc concentrations fig 3d in contrast to the do profile in the c pyrenoidosa and m aeruginosa added treatments the adhesion growth of c meneghiniana resulted in stable do levels 8 50 6 42 mg l 1 from day 14 to 61 fig 2c cao et al 2013 hence the aerobic environment in the overlying water promoted the mineralization of organic matter into co2 liikanen et al 2003 which eventually caused a higher co2 flux and lower ch4 flux during the decomposition of c meneghiniana overall after the algal succession from river dominated species to lake dominated species algal collapses caused anaerobic methanogenesis conditions which induced the mineralization of aom to ch4 4 2 methane production regulated by the availability and diversity of algae derived methanogenic substrates algal blooms have been shown to influence the dynamics of doc in freshwater ecosystems liu et al 2019b in the present study the settlement and decay of three studied phytoplankton species was accompanied by obvious changes in the carbon composition in the water column after 61 days of incubation the ptc displayed a decrease of 83 33 95 31 and the doc concentrations displayed a 1 53 fold to 4 92 fold increase the release of a large amount of fresh carbon substrate provided abundant substrates for ch4 production as a result the bioavailable substrate could be utilized by anaerobic methanogens and this contributed to ch4 production this was demonstrated in the finding that a positive correlation existed between the ch4 flux and doc concentration in the water fig s3 and this was also supported by the previous studies stanley et al 2016 liang et al 2016 however available studies have suggested that fluxes of ch4 vary during collapses of the bloom composed of different algae species west et al 2012 yan et al 2017 grasset et al 2018 this may be partly attributed to the different components of aom in the different species in freshwater the rate of ch4 production not only is related to the available organic matter but also is closely linked to the properties of the organic matter borrel et al 2011 the decomposition of algal cells releases abundant labile organic matter including polysaccharides and protein li et al 2020 fermentative microorganisms utilize labile algal carbon to produce acetate methyl group containing compounds and co2 h2 which are the available substrates for methanogens chen et al 2016 ye et al 2012 eryildiz et al 2020 the availability of labile algal carbon varies during the collapse of blooms in the present study the collapse of c pyrenoidosa and m aeruginosa blooms enhanced the release of polysaccharides and proteins which could be converted easily into methanogenic substrates and promote the growth of methanogens rathi et al 2019 moreover the proportion of simple aromatic proteins and soluble microbial byproduct like material released by the decomposition of c pyrenoidosa and m aeruginosa was significantly higher than that of c meneghiniana with the extension of the incubation fig s5 p 0 05 this result suggested that the increase in the labile organic matter was contributed to by the lake dominated algae under this condition the anaerobic microenvironment facilitated mineralization of organic matter to ch4 by many species of bacteria in the c pyrenoidosa and m aeruginosa added treatments therefore during the collapse of c pyrenoidosa and m aeruginosa blooms it was likely that the increased labile algal carbon content was a key factor in promoting ch4 production however the concentrations of polysaccharides and proteins were maintained at low levels during the incubation of c meneghiniana indicating that a small amount of substrates was provided to support the methanogenesis processes this results was in agreement with the lower ch4 production at the end of c meneghiniana added treatments fig s4 moreover the proportion of released humic acid like organics which were regarded as the limiting factors of ch4 production minderlein and blodau 2010 was observed to be higher in the c meneghiniana added treatments than in the c pyrenoidosa and m aeruginosa added treatments fig s5 this indicated that the composition of refractory substrates released during the decomposition of c meneghiniana cells might impair ch4 production therefore the availability and diversity of methanogenic substrates regulated the ch4 production during the collapse of river and lake dominated algae 4 3 decomposition of lake dominated algae benefited methanogens but impaired methanotrophs organic carbon plays a crucial role in shaping the bacterial community structure during algal collapses xue et al 2017 in turn bloom associated bacterial populations are important contributors in transforming aom methanogens constitute a highly specialized metabolic group of microorganisms and can utilize a restricted number of substrates such as h2 co2 ethanol and acetate to produce ch4 in anaerobic sediments eryildiz et al 2020 conrad 2009 their activity and abundance can substantially manipulate ch4 production several studies have reported that the collapse of dense cyanobacterial blooms contributes to a large shift in the structure and diversity of the microorganism community berry et al 2017 horner devine et al 2003 few studies however have been conducted that assess the response of methanogens and methanotrophs involved in ghg production to algal succession from river dominated algae to lake dominated algae in this study the relative abundances of unclassified f methanobacteriaceae methanospirillum methanobacterium and methanoregula in the sediment of the c pyrenoidosa and m aeruginosa added treatments were greatly enhanced after 61 days of incubation which agreed well with the outcomes concerning the abundance of the mcra gene in the two treatments the mcra gene was expressed in both hydrogenotrophic and acetoclastic methanogens hunger et al 2016 with the optimum growth conditions ph and do level and adequate labile organic matter ch4 production by methanogens was favored in the c pyrenoidosa and m aeruginosa added treatments moreover the mcra copy numbers and mcra pmoa ratio decreased in the sediment of the c meneghiniana added treatments which led to much lower ch4 production in the c meneghiniana treatments than in the other treatments in addition in this study methanotrophs which utilized ch4 as their sole carbon and energy source ho et al 2019 were found in the surface sediment of all algae added treatments after 61 days of incubation the relative abundance of methanotrophs and the pmoa copy numbers in the sediment of the c meneghiniana added treatments were nearly 2 to 3 fold higher than that in the c pyrenoidosa and m aeruginosa added treatments this suggested that the emitted ch4 could be further reduced as a result of oxidation by methanotrophs in the c meneghiniana added treatments 4 4 environmental implications despite the green credentials of hydropower reservoirs reservoirs formed by impoundments in dammed rivers have been considered to be hot spots of ch4 emissions because this activity is believed to be capable of accumulating organic material and producing water level fluctuation zones in rivers brandao et al 2019 wilkinson et al 2019 as a result a recent study reported that 104 teragrams of ch4 accounting for 20 of the total emissions is emitted annually by large hydropower dams and dammed reservoirs kumar et al 2019 however it should be noted that with the alteration of hydrodynamic properties in rivers the successions of phytoplankton can be substantially modified inducing the phytoplankton succession from river dominated algae to lake dominated algae therefore reservoir water with high primary productivity may result in high ch4 emissions deemer et al 2016 in fact the occurrence of algal blooms with the alteration of river dominated algae to lake dominated algae frequently has been reported in dammed rivers as well as in their tributaries nevertheless few studies have evaluated the potential role of phytoplankton succession in ch4 production this microcosm study found that the ch4 production in treatments that simulated the blooms of lake dominated algae c pyrenoidosa and m aeruginosa was much higher than that in the treatment simulating the bloom of river dominated algae c meneghiniana which primarily was due to the distinct water environment and diversified carbon substrate these results provided evidence that when accompanied by algal succession dammed rivers suffering from blooms of lake dominated algae could produce elevated levels of ch4 which increased the contribution of rivers to ghg production and further aggravated climate warming although this current study confirmed the underevaluated role of phytoplankton succession in ch4 production and identified the potential approaches that underlie the distinct ch4 production amount in dammed rivers the ch4 emissions at the water air interface were also closely related to the transformation and migration processes in the water column due to complex physicochemical factors in real world flowing rivers and dammed reservoirs therefore further investigations are required to explore the contribution of phytoplankton succession to total annual ch4 emission the multiple processes of the collapse of river dominated and lake dominated algal blooms and the relationships between algal succession and climate warming are illustrated in fig 7 the ghg ch4 and co2 emissions from algal blooms could intensify the greenhouse effect and they were enhanced during the collapse of lake dominated algal blooms concomitantly climate warming caused by the greenhouse effect and the release of nutrients n and p during the collapse of algal blooms jointly exacerbated the eutrophication of dammed rivers fig s6 this contributed to algal succession from river dominated algae to lake dominated algae and the frequent occurrence of algal blooms therefore algal successions are a neglected facilitator of ghg production and should be considered in future estimations of ch4 production in dammed rivers 5 conclusions the collapses of lake dominated algae c pyrenoidosa and m aeruginosa blooms played a more vital role in ch4 production than river dominated algae c meneghiniana this difference was attributed to the distinct water environment and diversified carbon substrate an aerobic state in the water was observed during the collapse of a high density c meneghiniana bloom whereas the collapse of c pyrenoidosa and m aeruginosa blooms induced an anaerobic reductive and slightly alkaline environment in the water moreover more labile organics such as proteins and polysaccharides were released into the water during the collapse of c pyrenoidosa and m aeruginosa blooms providing available substrates for methanogens therefore it provided evidence that the phytoplankton succession might be a new and important yet largely underestimated ch4 emission pathway when it occurred in river reservoir systems this should be considered when evaluating the effect of hydraulic projects on ghg emissions the results of this study expanded our knowledge of the general processes and potential mechanisms underlying ch4 production during collapses of river and

17591,probabilistic quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra studies define model inputs as random variables and use monte carlo simulation to generate distributions of potential risk outcomes if local information on important qmra model inputs is missing it is widely accepted to justify assumptions about these model inputs by using external literature information a question which remains unexplored is the extent to which previously published external information should influence local estimates in cases of nonexistent scarce and moderate local data this question can be addressed by employing bayesian hierarchical modeling bhm thus we study the effects and potential benefits of bhm on risk and performance target calculations at three wastewater treatment plants wwtp in comparison to alternative statistical modeling approaches separate modeling no pooling complete pooling the treated wastewater from the wwtps is used for restricted irrigation potable reuse or influences recreational waters respectively we quantify the extent to which external data affects local risk estimations in each case depending on the statistical modeling approach applied modeling approaches are compared by calculating the pointwise expected log predictive density for each model as reference pathogens and example data we use locally collected norovirus genogroup ii data with varying sample sizes n 4 n 7 n 27 and complement local information with external information from 44 other wwtps n 307 results indicate that bhm shows the highest predictive accuracy and improves estimates by reducing parameter uncertainty when data are scarce in such situations it may affect risk and performance target calculations by orders of magnitude in comparison to using local data alone furthermore it allows making generalizable inferences about new wwtps while providing the necessary flexibility to adjust for different levels of information contained in the local data applying this flexible technique more widely may contribute to improving methods and the evidence base for decision making in future qmra studies keywords bayesian hierarchical modeling meta analysis quantitative microbial risk assessment norovirus performance target combining information 1 introduction quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra was developed as a common framework to assess risks caused by pathogenic microorganisms qmra aims at supporting decision making related to the microbial safety of water systems the method supports decision making by quantifying health risks in local settings on a system level gonzales gustavson et al 2019 as well as by deriving general statements on health risks and pathogen reduction targets as done e g for recreational waters and water reuse systems boehm et al 2018 soller et al 2017 probabilistic qmra studies define model inputs as random variables and use monte carlo simulation to generate distributions of potential risk outcomes who 2016 however in qmra studies local data may be limited mcbride et al 2013 or completely absent mok et al 2014 soller et al 2017 in such situations distribution parameters for these random variables cannot be estimated precisely appropriate parameter estimates however are crucial for the robustness of simulation results and thus affect risk based decision making in qmra studies deriving assumptions about point estimates for these parameters from literature is a widely accepted approach when local data is completely absent systematic scientific reviews and meta analyses on important model inputs for qmra are valuable pieces of information in these situations for example a recently published meta analysis of the occurrence of norovirus nov in wastewater by eftim et al 2017 was used to inform qmra studies on the risk of illness due to exposure to recreational waters contaminated with aged sewage boehm et al 2018 and to assess the suitability of different wastewater treatment schemes to be used for direct potable reuse soller et al 2017 however the extent to which such external information influences local estimates against the background of nonexistent scarce and moderate local data is rarely explicitly addressed this question can be addressed by employing bayesian hierarchical modeling bhm while this technique has been applied e g to derive a generalized dose repose relation for adenovirus teunis et al 2016 the evaluation of microbial recovery rates petterson et al 2009 and the evaluation of treatment performances of ultrafiltration carvajal et al 2017 the relation between locally available data on pathogen concentrations in water that is supported by information from external sources has not been addressed in the water related qmra literature so far therefore the objective of the present study is to investigate the effects of incorporating external pathogen data via bhm to support estimates of local pathogen concentrations in source waters and its effect on resulting health risks calculations results are compared to more commonly used estimation approaches cf section 2 2 2 methods in the present study we investigate the effect of how different statistical approaches to including external information from the scientific literature may affect local risk and log reduction calculations we use norovirus genogroup ii novii data collected at three local municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtp as reference pathogens because nov is among the most relevant causes of infection risk and dominated risk calculations in cases where multiple pathogens have been assessed boehm et al 2018 soller et al 2017 while there are comparable estimation techniques available from classical statistics we use bayesian estimation methods based on markov chain monte carlo mcmc for all statistical analyses at all locations we estimate the required log reductions of water treatment based on wwtp inflow concentrations for achieving predefined health targets cf 2 5 2 1 local data and external information local data local data were made available from three different wastewater treatment plants located in europe at all locations there is a direct health relevance because the treated wastewater is either reused for irrigation or drinking water supply or directly influences nearby bathing waters table 1 the amount of local data varies between 4 data points at the wwtp for indirect potable reuse and 27 data points at the wwtp which impacts recreational waters due to the different local sample sizes large differences in parameter uncertainty can be expected samples were analyzed by laboratories in germany or spain using qpcr table 1 2 2 external information as external information we use a systematic review and meta analysis on nov wwtp influent concentrations by eftim et al 2017 the authors analyzed the collected nov data for geographical asia europe north america oceania as well as seasonal differences data were provided either directly from authors collected from tables or digitalized from graphs for estimating the mean µ and the standard deviation σ of the population distribution of nov observations of genogroups i and ii the authors grouped the data by continent and season and applied a bootstrapping approach on the grouped data based on this evaluation the authors reported a statistically significant difference between data from europe and north america for europe the authors collected 305 observations we followed the procedure of eftim et al 2017 collecting novii data for european wwtps either from reported tables or digitalizing them using the same software getdata graph digitalizer as our study focuses on estimates on the level of local wwtps we additionally grouped the data by wwtp see si this is a major difference between our approach and the one published by eftim et al 2017 who stayed at a continent level for data evaluation 2 3 statistical approaches and assumptions for local estimates in statistical inference observations i e data are used to estimate the unknown parameters of a statistical model in the simplest form the parameters of an assumed probability distribution therefore the degree to which external information influences local estimates inherently involves specific statistical assumptions about the relationship between these parameters at a local and general level in previous meta analyses and qmra studies various methods have been used to derive generalized estimates of the parameters of interest including complete pooling boehm et al 2018 eftim et al 2017 no pooling boehm et al 2019 and hierarchical modeling pouillot et al 2015 if local site specific data are available generally separate modeling is applied gonzales gustavson et al 2019 mcbride et al 2013 to evaluate the influence of different modeling assumptions we used the modeling approaches described below we use the indices i for individual observations j for individual wwtps and nov for cases in which data are pooled across wwtps respectively concentrations are assumed to be lognormally distributed which is a common assumption amoueyan et al 2019 pouillot et al 2015 soller et al 2018 especially in situations were data a too scarce to decide between other potential candidate distributions boehm et al 2018 separate models each wwtpj is regarded as being completely independent and results from one location do not influence the expectation of the other results are neither generalizable nor transferable model 1 lg n o v i n μ j i σ j i 2 i 1 n j 1 j complete pooling the wwtps and the applied analytical procedures are assumed to be completely comparable and observations from different wwtps are assumed to come from a common population they are assumed to be exchangeable with a common mean and variance 2 lg n o v i n μ n o v σ n o v 2 i 1 n no pooling for every wwtp j a separate mean µj is fitted but the residual standard deviation is constant across wwtps model 3 lg n o v i n μ j i σ n o v 2 i 1 n partial pooling µ via classical hierarchical modeling within the classical bayesian hierarchical multilevel framework a separate mean µj is estimated for every wwtp j the main additional assumption is that the local means µj come from a common distribution which in turn is described by a normal distribution the parameters of this common distribution η and τ² are referred to as hyperparameters this population distribution can be regarded as a prior distribution for the local means µj it is estimated from the data and does not depend on subjective choices of the analyst the variance τ2 represents the estimated between wwtp variability and can be used to estimate expectations of new wwtps by estimating all parameters on a data level and wwtp level simultaneously information is shared across studies which is referred to as partial pooling the within wwtp variability i e the data variance σ²nov is considered constant across groups model 4 lg n o v i n μ j i σ n o v 2 i 1 n μ j n η τ 2 j 1 j partial pooling µ and σ² via extended hierarchical modeling the classical hierarchical modeling approach can easily be extended by letting the individual within wwtp variances σj vary by wwtp this leads to a further extension of the model by an additional distribution estimated on a log scale since variances are restricted to be positive and additional hyperparameters α γ which represent the average population variance and the between wwtp variability of variances model 5 lg n o v i n μ j i σ j i 2 i 1 n μ j n η τ 2 j 1 j σ j 2 l o g n o r m a l α γ 2 j 1 j separate point estimates to investigate the effect of parameter uncertainty in general we additionally included the point estimates estimated with maximum likelihood derived from the local data without accounting for parameter uncertainty treatment of censored data in the local data no data points below the lod were measured however in the literature a small number of observations were below the lod see si for bayesian inference left censored data were handled by replacing the normal likelihood of these observations with the complementary cumulative normal distribution function a similar approach has been applied by pouillot et al 2015 model fitting we use bayesian estimation methods based on markov chain monte carlo mcmc for all statistical analyses to run mcmc simulations we use the programming languages r stan standevelopmentteam 2017 via the interface between r and stan brms bürkner 2017 stan implements hamiltonian monte carlo for mcmc we used the same weakly informative prior distributions for the location and scale parameters see si due to the large number of wwtp with small sample sizes a small step size 0 99 was chosen for every model we ran four independent markov chains with 20 000 iterations and a warm up phase of 10 000 thereby 40 000 independent posterior samples were created for further evaluation we chose this high number of samples as the posterior samples are not only used for estimation but also for subsequent risk simulation cf section 2 5 convergence of the markov chains were checked by inspecting whether the trace plots of the four chains were well mixed and by checking whether the gelman rubin diagnostic statistic r has converged to 1 2 3 calculating quantities of interest as quantities of interest we consider the marginal distributions of µ and σ of novii concentrations and the posterior predictive distribution ppd which represents the uncertainty about new observations given the observed data and included external information the average inflow concentration is of particular interest to determine the required log credits at a local setting as these are calculated from the difference between the average inflow and outflow concentrations the ppd is used for subsequent forward monte carlo risk simulation 2 4 model comparison and generalized estimates for a new unknown wwtp to compare the effects of the different statistical approaches on estimates for new i e unknown wwtps the marginal distributions of the mean as well as the posterior predictive distribution for new data are simulated from the estimates for η α γ and τ for the hierarchical approaches and µnov and σnov for the complete pooling approach for the separate modeling and no pooling approaches such estimations are not possible as these approaches assume independence of wwtps to assess the predictive performance of the different modeling approaches we calculate the expected pointwise leave one out loo log predictive density elpd using pareto smooth importance sampling according to vehtari et al 2017 the higher a model s elpd the more accurate the model s predictions are to be expected consequently the model with the highest elpd is preferred the loo elpd values are calculated by applying the loo function from the brms package to the fitted model objects models are refitted if k values are 0 7 model comparison is conducted by applying the functionloo compare which calculates the difference in the elpd between models 2 5 implications on risk calculation and performance targets to estimate the effect of different statistical estimation approaches on risk simulation and thus performance target derivation we run the following simulation simulation of the ppd of nov influent concentrations for each local wwtp and each estimation approach 40 000 draws application of assumed log reductions from source water to the point of exposure table 2 application of use specific exposure scenarios in terms of the volume ingested per event and number of exposure events per year table 2 risk simulation and comparison of results to existing risk based health targets table 2 repetition of the procedure to account for stochastic monte carlo uncertainty to isolate the effect of different statistical estimation approaches we assume that the remaining model inputs are perfectly known without variation table 2 no specific treatment train is assumed but log reductions include both technical barriers and natural die off from the wwtp inflow to the point of exposure from the predicted inflow concentrations ppd the population distribution of the expected doses per exposure event is calculated by 6 d 10 c i n f l u e n t t 1 n l r v t v i n g e s t e d where d is the dose per exposure event cinfluent is the ppd of novii in lg gc l lrv is the log removal value for treatment step t n is the number of treatment steps and vingested is the ingested volume in l from the population distribution of d we calculate the population distribution of risk outcomes per exposure event using the dose response relation published by teunis et al 2008 for disaggregated viruses eq 7 see si note the dose response relationship of norovirus is subject to ongoing discussion and alternative relationships have been proposed messner et al 2014 schmidt 2015 van abel et al 2017 7 p inf exposure 1 1 f 1 a a b d subsequently we estimate the sampling distribution of the average annual infection risk pannual by randomly rand in eq 8 resampling n number of exposure events times from the population distribution of event probabilities for 10 000 times to account for uncertainties caused by stochastic monte carlo sampling we repeat the full process starting from sampling from the ppd for 100 times for the irrigation and swimming scenario and 1000 times for the drinking water scenario this leads to 100 and 1000 distributions of the average annual risk for each assumed lrv consisting of 10 000 calculations for every distribution the proportion of samples below the health targets is calculated cf section 3 2 8 p a n n u a l 1 i 1 n 1 r a n d p inf exposure i 3 results fig 1 shows all available data which originate from 44 different wwtps across europe the empirical geometric mean of the different wwtp varies between approximately 4 1 and 7 6 lg gc l while the variation of individual observations within a single wwtp varies by up to 6 orders of magnitude wwtp 44 the three local wwtps 100 101 102 have empirical means of 5 8 lg gc l 4 95 lg gc l and 5 98 lg gc l respectively these values differ from the mean calculated from all data 5 42 lg gc l by approximately 0 5 log in both directions the number of data points per wwtp varies between 2 and 49 with 27 data points the local wwtp 102 is one of the largest data sets on a wwtp level while with 4 data points wwtp 101 only provides little local information 3 1 marginal parameter distributions and ppd for new observations figs 2 and 3 summarize the estimates and corresponding uncertainty of the parameters µ and σ for the local wwtps fig 4 shows the resulting ppd for new observations since in bayesian inference probability is used to express uncertainty all parameters have probability distribution themselves referred to as marginal distributions fig 2 shows the marginal distributions of the mean novii concentrations the estimates of the different approaches differ both regarding the location of the mean µ and the scale of the distribution which reflects the uncertainty of the estimated mean regarding the location the complete pooling approach delivers the same estimate for all wwtps µ 5 4 lg gc l the scenarios separate point estimate dashed line separate modeling and no pooling estimate identical means for the individual wwtps which correspond to the empirical means of the local data as the three approaches estimate mean concentrations separately it can be observed that the individual local point estimates differ from the complete pooling estimate by approximately 0 5 log units for wwtps 101 and 102 while the difference is smaller approximately 0 35 log units for wwtp 100 this difference shows that by applying a complete pooling approach which assumes that all data come from a common wwtp the 305 data points from literature outweigh the local data even with a sample size of n 27 the two hierarchical modeling approaches in turn lead to point estimates location which lie between the complete pooling and the separate estimates the exact location of the estimate depends on the amount of local information i e data per wwtp and the variance ratio of the local data variances σ j i 2 and the between wwtp variance τ2 for wwtp 102 the estimated modes from hierarchical modeling are virtually identical to the separate estimates for wwtps 101 and 102 with 4 and 7 local data points estimates are closer to the separate estimates than to the complete pooling estimate this indicates that for the case of novii concentrations already a small number of local data points may suffice to provide valuable additional information against the background of the large variation of reported concentrations in the scientific literature differences between approaches become more obvious when the corresponding uncertainty intervals are examined their widths depend on the estimates of the standard deviation fig 3 and the sample size at each location by definition separate point estimation does not account for parameter uncertainty at all dashed line thus no distinction is made whether the estimate derives from a wwtp with only 4 data points or one with 27 the complete pooling approach leads to the most precise estimate as the standard error is calculated assuming that all 345 data points come from a common wwtp for no pooling and classical hierarchical modeling the commonly estimated residual standard deviation is reduced in comparison to the complete pooling approach however since local standard errors are derived from local sample sizes the resulting uncertainty intervals become wider compared to the complete pooling approach fig 3 shows the marginal distribution of the residual standard deviation of the different estimation approaches as for the marginal distributions of the means the standard deviations of the different approaches differ in their location and the width of the uncertainty intervals regarding the location complete pooling leads to the highest residual standard deviation followed by no pooling and the classical hierarchical model while these three approaches differ in the location mode of the distribution the uncertainty intervals of these three approaches are similar because all three approaches estimate the residual standard deviation from all data points as they assume a constant σ across wwtps in contrast separate modeling separate point estimation and the extended hierarchical model show residual standard deviations which are considerably lower mode of the distribution than the estimates from the named three approaches as they estimate a separate σ for each wwtp along with the estimation of µ however these estimation approaches differ mainly regarding the width of the uncertainty intervals separate point estimation ignores parameter uncertainty completely dashed line while for separate modeling the width of the uncertainty interval is only influenced by the locally available data for the extended hierarchical model uncertainty intervals are the result of the information contained in the local data and the information provided by the meta analysis from the remaining 46 wwtp for wwtp 102 there is little difference between the estimate inferred by separate modeling and the extended hierarchical model for wwtps 100 and 101 differences are more visible while the modes of the distributions correspond to each other separate modeling with 7 and 4 data points leads to marginal posterior distributions with heavy tails that still include values of up to 4 2 in the 95 uncertainty intervals for extended hierarchical modeling the upper confidence limits are reduced to values of approximately 1 6 thereby extended hierarchical modeling substantially reduces parameter uncertainty and thus predictive uncertainty on a local level in comparison to separate modeling fig 4 fig 4 shows the full ppd plotted as the complementary cumulative density function thus the y axis shows the probability of a single new observation exceeding the corresponding value on the x axis this visualization emphasizes the behavior of the distribution at its tails smeets et al 2008 which is important for understanding the results of risk simulation cf section 3 2 the ppd moreover incorporates complete parameter uncertainty regarding µ and σ except from separate point estimation for which this is ignored by definition as expected separate point estimation leads to the narrowest ppd for all scenarios for separate modeling the resulting ppd corresponds to separate point estimation in the case of wwtp 102 with 27 data points for wwtps 101 and 102 with 7 and 4 data points on the other hand the inclusion of parameter uncertainty leads to completely different behavior especially at the upper tails of the distribution which reflects the large uncertainty of both µ and σ caused by small sample size 3 2 effects on risk and performance target calculations figs 5 7 illustrate the calculated risk against the set health targets and assumed log reductions for the swimming scenario fig 5 the complete pooling scenario leads to the lowest required log reduction if the median risk white line is used for decision making since the average derived from all data lies below the average derived from the locally collected ones however if the uncertainty is taken into account meaning that the complete 95 uncertainty interval upper grey boundary has to fall below the threshold level then separate modeling and the extended hierarchical model lead to a required log reduction of 7 4 this lies about 0 7 log below the reduction derived from complete pooling 8 1 log separate modeling and the extended hierarchical model have in common that both the mean and the standard deviation are estimated individually for each wwtp in contrast the no pooling and classical hierarchical models estimate a common residual standard deviation after accounting for differences in the wwtp specific means since the standard deviation of the locally collected data is lower than the one derived from all data the estimation approaches which estimate the standard deviation separately lead to narrower uncertainty intervals the drinking water and irrigation scenario differ from the swimming scenario since risk calculations are based on multiple exposure events per year in contrast to the single exposure risk for swimming thus a direct comparison between prediction intervals and risk calculations is less intuitive for the drinking water scenario the lowest required log reduction is derived from separate point estimation 12 log the required log reduction derived from the remaining approaches depends on whether the median or the full uncertainty interval is used for decision making for the median the extended hierarchical modeling approach leads to a required log reduction of 12 8 log followed by 13 2 13 3 log for the classical hierarchical and no pooling approaches 14 log for complete pooling and 16 log for the separate modeling approach if decisions are based on the complete uncertainty differences are reduced to 0 5 1 log between approximately 14 log for the no pooling and the two hierarchical models in comparison to 14 8 log for complete pooling and separate modeling 16 this order generally corresponds to the width of the posterior predictive distribution shown in fig 4 a striking feature is that even a reduction by 15 log does not suffice to reduce to the median risk below the applied threshold risk of infection of 10 4 per person per year for the separate modeling approach moreover the increase of the assumed log reduction reduces the median calculated risk quite linearly for all estimation approaches except from separate modeling see fig a2 in the si for separate modeling only the uncertainty interval increases but the calculated median risk stays between 10 1 and 1 per person per year fig 6 while this behavior seems counterintuitive at first it can be explained by investigating fig 4 in combination with the applied dose response relationship and the corresponding exposure scenarios see si from fig 4 it can be deduced that the probability of simulating a single observation which is larger than 1015 gc l is as low as 10 2 75 0 00178 for the separate modeling approach with an assumed log reduction of 15 these probabilities correspond to the event of ingesting at least 1 virus in a single event while these probabilities seem very low it has to be considered that for the annual average risk 365 samples are taken which increases the probability of ingesting at least 1 virus particle per year to 0 48 as the probability of infection by ingesting a single virus particle is already 0 27 and rapidly increases to 0 5 with increasing dose the calculated median risk stays between 10 1 and 1 even for a log reduction of 15 the large difference between the result from separate point estimation 12 log and separate modeling 15 log underlines the high importance of explicitly addressing parameter uncertainty in microbial risk simulation a further interesting observation is that the monte carlo error is largest for the drinking water scenario this is not related to the small sample size but to the narrower confidence intervals of the annual risk distribution caused by 365 samples per year in comparison to 50 and 1 respectively risk calculations of the median annual risk for the irrigation scenario show similar behavior as the drinking water scenario uncertainty intervals are generally wider fig a3 in si due to the lower number of exposure events per year which lead to a less step curve in fig 7 and a smaller monte carlo error if the median is used for decision making differences between approaches lie between 0 5 and 1 log with separate point estimation leading to the lowest required log reduction followed by the two hierarchical approaches complete pooling no pooling and finally separate modeling however if the 95 uncertainty boundary is used the difference between separate modeling and the extended hierarchical modeling approach increases to up to 2 8 log the extended hierarchical model lies in turn 0 8 log below the complete pooling approach this underlines the benefits of applying a flexible approach like bhm which integrates both literature and local information interestingly the location of the median risk derived from separate point estimation and the two hierarchical modeling approaches fall below the median risk of the complete pooling approach even though their inferred means cf fig 2 are above the mean derived from complete pooling this can be explained by the larger standard deviation of the complete pooling approach in combination with the effect of multiple annual exposures 50 exposure events per year i e resampling as already described for the drinking water scenario 3 3 model comparison and generalized estimates for new wwtps fig 8 shows the generalized estimates for new data prediction interval and the uncertainty about the mean of a new unobserved wwtp simulated from the estimates for η and τ for the hierarchical approaches and µnov and σnov for the complete pooling approach an interesting observation is the width of the uncertainty intervals regarding the prediction of a new mean novii concentration at an unknown wwtp as the complete pooling approach assumes that all data come from a comparable wwtp the between wwtp variability is not specifically addressed the location of the mean and the standard error are estimated from all data this leads to an elevated mean value and narrow confidence intervals in comparison to the hierarchical modeling approaches the narrow confidence interval however is not consistent with the high between wwtp variability present in the empirical data in contrast the 95 uncertainty intervals derived from hierarchical modeling cover 96 45 47 of the observed empirical means thus the two approaches provide a more uncertain but also more realistic estimate of the existing between wwtp variability the calculated expected log predictive density also supports the advantage of the two hierarchical modeling approaches over the complete pooling approach fig 9 results show that in the presented case the extended hierarchical model is expected to produce the most accurate predictions of novii concentrations the classical hierarchical model and the no pooling approach lead to similar results whereas the complete pooling approach is expected to deliver the worst predictive accuracy in comparison to the other estimation approaches 4 discussion in the present study we investigated the effect of including external information from the scientific literature on local estimates using bhm based on the case of novii concentrations in the influent of municipal wwtps to the best of our knowledge such an approach to quantitatively combine local and external information to reduce parameter uncertainty on a local level has not been conducted so far in the qmra literature in the literature two major meta analyses were identified that address concentrations of novii eftim et al 2017 pouillot et al 2015 in wwtps using different statistical approaches bootstrapping hierarchical modeling however in both studies the focus was put on the derivation of generalizable estimates of novii concentrations instead of investigating the effect on a local scale our results showed that the benefit of incorporating external information is largest in situations where local data are sparse n 4 n 7 in such situations parameter uncertainty would be so large that no reliable estimate of concentrations and log reductions would be possible without the use of external information our results also showed that even a small sample size in combination with external information might contribute valuable information to reduce the estimate of the required log reduction to reasonable values the fact that even small sample sizes affect estimates in hierarchical modeling is an indication that the between wwtp variability is high and only little pooling occurs reasons for the high between wwtp variability may include differences in population size season climate incidence in the population and analytical methods and protocols this shows that nov concentrations from a single wwtp should not directly be used to inform assumptions about nov concentration at other locations however since the degree of pooling that occurs in bayesian hierarchical modeling depends on the between wwtp variability this fact is accounted for and only little information is shared between wwtps thus employing this technique reduces the risk of not accounting for these variations by imposing too strong assumptions or pooling over interesting features in the dataset while a data set of four data points at wwtp 101 for which the effect was largest is extremely small small sample sizes at single locations are not uncommon in the qmra literature for example mcbride et al 2013 conducted a discharge based qmra study and measured pathogens in stormwater from catchments with different characteristics within each catchment type the sample size per site varied between 8 samples at 8 sites for dry season urban runoff i e 1 sample per site to 7 samples at 1 site for forested open space stormwater for the remaining catchment types sample sizes varied between 3 and 4 samples per site amoueyan et al 2019 used novii surface water concentration published by lodder and de roda husman 2005 for a qmra based comparison of direct potable reuse and unintentional de facto reuse in the latter publication 8 novii observations are reported which were collected at two rivers in the netherlands 4 observations at each river thus the situation of relying only on a couple of observations can be regarded as a realistic scenario for which hierarchical modeling might be a suitable and transparent solution for addressing and potentially reducing parameter uncertainty moreover this information might also be of high practical relevance for applied risk based decision making because operators may be confronted with the decision about whether to take additional efforts to collect local data or to plan potentially necessary risk reduction measures based on the available body of knowledge provided by the scientific literature or guideline documents our results show that even small sample sizes might be beneficial in combination with external information and might lead to lower required log reduction i e less resource depletion and cost in comparison to e g a complete pooling approach however it is important to underline that small sample sizes are only beneficial if they are combined with external information otherwise parameter uncertainty is too high our results also show that bayesian hierarchical modeling allows for making generalizable estimates about new locations in our case wwtps which explicitly account for the between location variability of model parameters as a result the predictions of a new mean µ becomes much wider than if a complete pooling approach is applied our prediction for a unknown mean influent concentration at an unknown wwtp covers a range between 3 5 and 6 5 interestingly if this range which is derived only from european wwtp is compared to the estimates reported by eftim et al 2017 for differences between geographic regions all of the estimates reported by eftim north america europe asia new zealand fall inside the derived prediction interval of the present study therefore the statistically significant difference between nov concentrations in north america in comparison to the ones in asia and europe reported in eftim et al 2017 has to be regarded with caution because it might only be an artifact of the statistical procedure which does not account for the between wwtp variability more generally the question about appropriate methods for selecting one statistical model over the other for summarizing information via meta analysis deserves more attention in our study we used the pointwise expected log predictive density as a quantitative indication which statistical model might be the most accurate such or similar approaches like the application of information criteria might be reasonable ways to make decisions about which modeling approach to apply more transparent one additional advantage we see when using bayesian hierarchical modeling is that in contrast to complete pooling the generalized estimates from µ and σ represented by the estimates for η τ α and γ in eq 5 may function as a prior distribution for subsequent studies that means that knowledge can be transferred by reporting only the parameterization of the priors for µ and σ which can function as a starting point for subsequent updates this feature might be potentially interesting because collecting raw data by contacting authors or digitalizing them from graphs is very time consuming especially in comparison to methods like bootstrapping which always requires the full raw data set communicating a generalized prior for subsequent analysis might be a promising way to ease the use of literature information by subsequent studies for illustration we fitted the extended hierarchical model to the literature data only and subsequently updated the deduced informative prior using the local data fig 10 parameter values differ slightly from the complete analysis as the data from the other two local wwtp are not included in the prior it can be seen that as for the complete analysis parameter uncertainty can be reduced substantially in low data situations 100 101 while estimates are not affected if the local information is strong 102 moreover while our study used the simple example of fitting a mean and standard deviation of a lognormal distribution bhm can readily be extended to the estimation of other model parameters like e g the slopes in a regression model 5 conclusion bayesian hierarchical modeling allows for reducing local parameter uncertainty in comparison to separate modeling while being flexible enough to let local data dominate local estimates in contrast to e g complete pooling external information provided e g by published meta analyses helps to reduce local parameter estimates and should be considered to be included quantitatively into qmra studies even when local data is available in cases of limited sample sizes parameter uncertainty may be too large to make reasonable inferences based on local data alone therefore parameter uncertainty should be considered explicitly in future qmra studies in combination with external information already small local data sets may help to reduce the required log performance in local settings and justifies additional measurements before planning suitable risk reduction measures model comparison and selection methods like e g information criteria or the expected log predictive density should be considered in future

17591,probabilistic quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra studies define model inputs as random variables and use monte carlo simulation to generate distributions of potential risk outcomes if local information on important qmra model inputs is missing it is widely accepted to justify assumptions about these model inputs by using external literature information a question which remains unexplored is the extent to which previously published external information should influence local estimates in cases of nonexistent scarce and moderate local data this question can be addressed by employing bayesian hierarchical modeling bhm thus we study the effects and potential benefits of bhm on risk and performance target calculations at three wastewater treatment plants wwtp in comparison to alternative statistical modeling approaches separate modeling no pooling complete pooling the treated wastewater from the wwtps is used for restricted irrigation potable reuse or influences recreational waters respectively we quantify the extent to which external data affects local risk estimations in each case depending on the statistical modeling approach applied modeling approaches are compared by calculating the pointwise expected log predictive density for each model as reference pathogens and example data we use locally collected norovirus genogroup ii data with varying sample sizes n 4 n 7 n 27 and complement local information with external information from 44 other wwtps n 307 results indicate that bhm shows the highest predictive accuracy and improves estimates by reducing parameter uncertainty when data are scarce in such situations it may affect risk and performance target calculations by orders of magnitude in comparison to using local data alone furthermore it allows making generalizable inferences about new wwtps while providing the necessary flexibility to adjust for different levels of information contained in the local data applying this flexible technique more widely may contribute to improving methods and the evidence base for decision making in future qmra studies keywords bayesian hierarchical modeling meta analysis quantitative microbial risk assessment norovirus performance target combining information 1 introduction quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra was developed as a common framework to assess risks caused by pathogenic microorganisms qmra aims at supporting decision making related to the microbial safety of water systems the method supports decision making by quantifying health risks in local settings on a system level gonzales gustavson et al 2019 as well as by deriving general statements on health risks and pathogen reduction targets as done e g for recreational waters and water reuse systems boehm et al 2018 soller et al 2017 probabilistic qmra studies define model inputs as random variables and use monte carlo simulation to generate distributions of potential risk outcomes who 2016 however in qmra studies local data may be limited mcbride et al 2013 or completely absent mok et al 2014 soller et al 2017 in such situations distribution parameters for these random variables cannot be estimated precisely appropriate parameter estimates however are crucial for the robustness of simulation results and thus affect risk based decision making in qmra studies deriving assumptions about point estimates for these parameters from literature is a widely accepted approach when local data is completely absent systematic scientific reviews and meta analyses on important model inputs for qmra are valuable pieces of information in these situations for example a recently published meta analysis of the occurrence of norovirus nov in wastewater by eftim et al 2017 was used to inform qmra studies on the risk of illness due to exposure to recreational waters contaminated with aged sewage boehm et al 2018 and to assess the suitability of different wastewater treatment schemes to be used for direct potable reuse soller et al 2017 however the extent to which such external information influences local estimates against the background of nonexistent scarce and moderate local data is rarely explicitly addressed this question can be addressed by employing bayesian hierarchical modeling bhm while this technique has been applied e g to derive a generalized dose repose relation for adenovirus teunis et al 2016 the evaluation of microbial recovery rates petterson et al 2009 and the evaluation of treatment performances of ultrafiltration carvajal et al 2017 the relation between locally available data on pathogen concentrations in water that is supported by information from external sources has not been addressed in the water related qmra literature so far therefore the objective of the present study is to investigate the effects of incorporating external pathogen data via bhm to support estimates of local pathogen concentrations in source waters and its effect on resulting health risks calculations results are compared to more commonly used estimation approaches cf section 2 2 2 methods in the present study we investigate the effect of how different statistical approaches to including external information from the scientific literature may affect local risk and log reduction calculations we use norovirus genogroup ii novii data collected at three local municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtp as reference pathogens because nov is among the most relevant causes of infection risk and dominated risk calculations in cases where multiple pathogens have been assessed boehm et al 2018 soller et al 2017 while there are comparable estimation techniques available from classical statistics we use bayesian estimation methods based on markov chain monte carlo mcmc for all statistical analyses at all locations we estimate the required log reductions of water treatment based on wwtp inflow concentrations for achieving predefined health targets cf 2 5 2 1 local data and external information local data local data were made available from three different wastewater treatment plants located in europe at all locations there is a direct health relevance because the treated wastewater is either reused for irrigation or drinking water supply or directly influences nearby bathing waters table 1 the amount of local data varies between 4 data points at the wwtp for indirect potable reuse and 27 data points at the wwtp which impacts recreational waters due to the different local sample sizes large differences in parameter uncertainty can be expected samples were analyzed by laboratories in germany or spain using qpcr table 1 2 2 external information as external information we use a systematic review and meta analysis on nov wwtp influent concentrations by eftim et al 2017 the authors analyzed the collected nov data for geographical asia europe north america oceania as well as seasonal differences data were provided either directly from authors collected from tables or digitalized from graphs for estimating the mean µ and the standard deviation σ of the population distribution of nov observations of genogroups i and ii the authors grouped the data by continent and season and applied a bootstrapping approach on the grouped data based on this evaluation the authors reported a statistically significant difference between data from europe and north america for europe the authors collected 305 observations we followed the procedure of eftim et al 2017 collecting novii data for european wwtps either from reported tables or digitalizing them using the same software getdata graph digitalizer as our study focuses on estimates on the level of local wwtps we additionally grouped the data by wwtp see si this is a major difference between our approach and the one published by eftim et al 2017 who stayed at a continent level for data evaluation 2 3 statistical approaches and assumptions for local estimates in statistical inference observations i e data are used to estimate the unknown parameters of a statistical model in the simplest form the parameters of an assumed probability distribution therefore the degree to which external information influences local estimates inherently involves specific statistical assumptions about the relationship between these parameters at a local and general level in previous meta analyses and qmra studies various methods have been used to derive generalized estimates of the parameters of interest including complete pooling boehm et al 2018 eftim et al 2017 no pooling boehm et al 2019 and hierarchical modeling pouillot et al 2015 if local site specific data are available generally separate modeling is applied gonzales gustavson et al 2019 mcbride et al 2013 to evaluate the influence of different modeling assumptions we used the modeling approaches described below we use the indices i for individual observations j for individual wwtps and nov for cases in which data are pooled across wwtps respectively concentrations are assumed to be lognormally distributed which is a common assumption amoueyan et al 2019 pouillot et al 2015 soller et al 2018 especially in situations were data a too scarce to decide between other potential candidate distributions boehm et al 2018 separate models each wwtpj is regarded as being completely independent and results from one location do not influence the expectation of the other results are neither generalizable nor transferable model 1 lg n o v i n μ j i σ j i 2 i 1 n j 1 j complete pooling the wwtps and the applied analytical procedures are assumed to be completely comparable and observations from different wwtps are assumed to come from a common population they are assumed to be exchangeable with a common mean and variance 2 lg n o v i n μ n o v σ n o v 2 i 1 n no pooling for every wwtp j a separate mean µj is fitted but the residual standard deviation is constant across wwtps model 3 lg n o v i n μ j i σ n o v 2 i 1 n partial pooling µ via classical hierarchical modeling within the classical bayesian hierarchical multilevel framework a separate mean µj is estimated for every wwtp j the main additional assumption is that the local means µj come from a common distribution which in turn is described by a normal distribution the parameters of this common distribution η and τ² are referred to as hyperparameters this population distribution can be regarded as a prior distribution for the local means µj it is estimated from the data and does not depend on subjective choices of the analyst the variance τ2 represents the estimated between wwtp variability and can be used to estimate expectations of new wwtps by estimating all parameters on a data level and wwtp level simultaneously information is shared across studies which is referred to as partial pooling the within wwtp variability i e the data variance σ²nov is considered constant across groups model 4 lg n o v i n μ j i σ n o v 2 i 1 n μ j n η τ 2 j 1 j partial pooling µ and σ² via extended hierarchical modeling the classical hierarchical modeling approach can easily be extended by letting the individual within wwtp variances σj vary by wwtp this leads to a further extension of the model by an additional distribution estimated on a log scale since variances are restricted to be positive and additional hyperparameters α γ which represent the average population variance and the between wwtp variability of variances model 5 lg n o v i n μ j i σ j i 2 i 1 n μ j n η τ 2 j 1 j σ j 2 l o g n o r m a l α γ 2 j 1 j separate point estimates to investigate the effect of parameter uncertainty in general we additionally included the point estimates estimated with maximum likelihood derived from the local data without accounting for parameter uncertainty treatment of censored data in the local data no data points below the lod were measured however in the literature a small number of observations were below the lod see si for bayesian inference left censored data were handled by replacing the normal likelihood of these observations with the complementary cumulative normal distribution function a similar approach has been applied by pouillot et al 2015 model fitting we use bayesian estimation methods based on markov chain monte carlo mcmc for all statistical analyses to run mcmc simulations we use the programming languages r stan standevelopmentteam 2017 via the interface between r and stan brms bürkner 2017 stan implements hamiltonian monte carlo for mcmc we used the same weakly informative prior distributions for the location and scale parameters see si due to the large number of wwtp with small sample sizes a small step size 0 99 was chosen for every model we ran four independent markov chains with 20 000 iterations and a warm up phase of 10 000 thereby 40 000 independent posterior samples were created for further evaluation we chose this high number of samples as the posterior samples are not only used for estimation but also for subsequent risk simulation cf section 2 5 convergence of the markov chains were checked by inspecting whether the trace plots of the four chains were well mixed and by checking whether the gelman rubin diagnostic statistic r has converged to 1 2 3 calculating quantities of interest as quantities of interest we consider the marginal distributions of µ and σ of novii concentrations and the posterior predictive distribution ppd which represents the uncertainty about new observations given the observed data and included external information the average inflow concentration is of particular interest to determine the required log credits at a local setting as these are calculated from the difference between the average inflow and outflow concentrations the ppd is used for subsequent forward monte carlo risk simulation 2 4 model comparison and generalized estimates for a new unknown wwtp to compare the effects of the different statistical approaches on estimates for new i e unknown wwtps the marginal distributions of the mean as well as the posterior predictive distribution for new data are simulated from the estimates for η α γ and τ for the hierarchical approaches and µnov and σnov for the complete pooling approach for the separate modeling and no pooling approaches such estimations are not possible as these approaches assume independence of wwtps to assess the predictive performance of the different modeling approaches we calculate the expected pointwise leave one out loo log predictive density elpd using pareto smooth importance sampling according to vehtari et al 2017 the higher a model s elpd the more accurate the model s predictions are to be expected consequently the model with the highest elpd is preferred the loo elpd values are calculated by applying the loo function from the brms package to the fitted model objects models are refitted if k values are 0 7 model comparison is conducted by applying the functionloo compare which calculates the difference in the elpd between models 2 5 implications on risk calculation and performance targets to estimate the effect of different statistical estimation approaches on risk simulation and thus performance target derivation we run the following simulation simulation of the ppd of nov influent concentrations for each local wwtp and each estimation approach 40 000 draws application of assumed log reductions from source water to the point of exposure table 2 application of use specific exposure scenarios in terms of the volume ingested per event and number of exposure events per year table 2 risk simulation and comparison of results to existing risk based health targets table 2 repetition of the procedure to account for stochastic monte carlo uncertainty to isolate the effect of different statistical estimation approaches we assume that the remaining model inputs are perfectly known without variation table 2 no specific treatment train is assumed but log reductions include both technical barriers and natural die off from the wwtp inflow to the point of exposure from the predicted inflow concentrations ppd the population distribution of the expected doses per exposure event is calculated by 6 d 10 c i n f l u e n t t 1 n l r v t v i n g e s t e d where d is the dose per exposure event cinfluent is the ppd of novii in lg gc l lrv is the log removal value for treatment step t n is the number of treatment steps and vingested is the ingested volume in l from the population distribution of d we calculate the population distribution of risk outcomes per exposure event using the dose response relation published by teunis et al 2008 for disaggregated viruses eq 7 see si note the dose response relationship of norovirus is subject to ongoing discussion and alternative relationships have been proposed messner et al 2014 schmidt 2015 van abel et al 2017 7 p inf exposure 1 1 f 1 a a b d subsequently we estimate the sampling distribution of the average annual infection risk pannual by randomly rand in eq 8 resampling n number of exposure events times from the population distribution of event probabilities for 10 000 times to account for uncertainties caused by stochastic monte carlo sampling we repeat the full process starting from sampling from the ppd for 100 times for the irrigation and swimming scenario and 1000 times for the drinking water scenario this leads to 100 and 1000 distributions of the average annual risk for each assumed lrv consisting of 10 000 calculations for every distribution the proportion of samples below the health targets is calculated cf section 3 2 8 p a n n u a l 1 i 1 n 1 r a n d p inf exposure i 3 results fig 1 shows all available data which originate from 44 different wwtps across europe the empirical geometric mean of the different wwtp varies between approximately 4 1 and 7 6 lg gc l while the variation of individual observations within a single wwtp varies by up to 6 orders of magnitude wwtp 44 the three local wwtps 100 101 102 have empirical means of 5 8 lg gc l 4 95 lg gc l and 5 98 lg gc l respectively these values differ from the mean calculated from all data 5 42 lg gc l by approximately 0 5 log in both directions the number of data points per wwtp varies between 2 and 49 with 27 data points the local wwtp 102 is one of the largest data sets on a wwtp level while with 4 data points wwtp 101 only provides little local information 3 1 marginal parameter distributions and ppd for new observations figs 2 and 3 summarize the estimates and corresponding uncertainty of the parameters µ and σ for the local wwtps fig 4 shows the resulting ppd for new observations since in bayesian inference probability is used to express uncertainty all parameters have probability distribution themselves referred to as marginal distributions fig 2 shows the marginal distributions of the mean novii concentrations the estimates of the different approaches differ both regarding the location of the mean µ and the scale of the distribution which reflects the uncertainty of the estimated mean regarding the location the complete pooling approach delivers the same estimate for all wwtps µ 5 4 lg gc l the scenarios separate point estimate dashed line separate modeling and no pooling estimate identical means for the individual wwtps which correspond to the empirical means of the local data as the three approaches estimate mean concentrations separately it can be observed that the individual local point estimates differ from the complete pooling estimate by approximately 0 5 log units for wwtps 101 and 102 while the difference is smaller approximately 0 35 log units for wwtp 100 this difference shows that by applying a complete pooling approach which assumes that all data come from a common wwtp the 305 data points from literature outweigh the local data even with a sample size of n 27 the two hierarchical modeling approaches in turn lead to point estimates location which lie between the complete pooling and the separate estimates the exact location of the estimate depends on the amount of local information i e data per wwtp and the variance ratio of the local data variances σ j i 2 and the between wwtp variance τ2 for wwtp 102 the estimated modes from hierarchical modeling are virtually identical to the separate estimates for wwtps 101 and 102 with 4 and 7 local data points estimates are closer to the separate estimates than to the complete pooling estimate this indicates that for the case of novii concentrations already a small number of local data points may suffice to provide valuable additional information against the background of the large variation of reported concentrations in the scientific literature differences between approaches become more obvious when the corresponding uncertainty intervals are examined their widths depend on the estimates of the standard deviation fig 3 and the sample size at each location by definition separate point estimation does not account for parameter uncertainty at all dashed line thus no distinction is made whether the estimate derives from a wwtp with only 4 data points or one with 27 the complete pooling approach leads to the most precise estimate as the standard error is calculated assuming that all 345 data points come from a common wwtp for no pooling and classical hierarchical modeling the commonly estimated residual standard deviation is reduced in comparison to the complete pooling approach however since local standard errors are derived from local sample sizes the resulting uncertainty intervals become wider compared to the complete pooling approach fig 3 shows the marginal distribution of the residual standard deviation of the different estimation approaches as for the marginal distributions of the means the standard deviations of the different approaches differ in their location and the width of the uncertainty intervals regarding the location complete pooling leads to the highest residual standard deviation followed by no pooling and the classical hierarchical model while these three approaches differ in the location mode of the distribution the uncertainty intervals of these three approaches are similar because all three approaches estimate the residual standard deviation from all data points as they assume a constant σ across wwtps in contrast separate modeling separate point estimation and the extended hierarchical model show residual standard deviations which are considerably lower mode of the distribution than the estimates from the named three approaches as they estimate a separate σ for each wwtp along with the estimation of µ however these estimation approaches differ mainly regarding the width of the uncertainty intervals separate point estimation ignores parameter uncertainty completely dashed line while for separate modeling the width of the uncertainty interval is only influenced by the locally available data for the extended hierarchical model uncertainty intervals are the result of the information contained in the local data and the information provided by the meta analysis from the remaining 46 wwtp for wwtp 102 there is little difference between the estimate inferred by separate modeling and the extended hierarchical model for wwtps 100 and 101 differences are more visible while the modes of the distributions correspond to each other separate modeling with 7 and 4 data points leads to marginal posterior distributions with heavy tails that still include values of up to 4 2 in the 95 uncertainty intervals for extended hierarchical modeling the upper confidence limits are reduced to values of approximately 1 6 thereby extended hierarchical modeling substantially reduces parameter uncertainty and thus predictive uncertainty on a local level in comparison to separate modeling fig 4 fig 4 shows the full ppd plotted as the complementary cumulative density function thus the y axis shows the probability of a single new observation exceeding the corresponding value on the x axis this visualization emphasizes the behavior of the distribution at its tails smeets et al 2008 which is important for understanding the results of risk simulation cf section 3 2 the ppd moreover incorporates complete parameter uncertainty regarding µ and σ except from separate point estimation for which this is ignored by definition as expected separate point estimation leads to the narrowest ppd for all scenarios for separate modeling the resulting ppd corresponds to separate point estimation in the case of wwtp 102 with 27 data points for wwtps 101 and 102 with 7 and 4 data points on the other hand the inclusion of parameter uncertainty leads to completely different behavior especially at the upper tails of the distribution which reflects the large uncertainty of both µ and σ caused by small sample size 3 2 effects on risk and performance target calculations figs 5 7 illustrate the calculated risk against the set health targets and assumed log reductions for the swimming scenario fig 5 the complete pooling scenario leads to the lowest required log reduction if the median risk white line is used for decision making since the average derived from all data lies below the average derived from the locally collected ones however if the uncertainty is taken into account meaning that the complete 95 uncertainty interval upper grey boundary has to fall below the threshold level then separate modeling and the extended hierarchical model lead to a required log reduction of 7 4 this lies about 0 7 log below the reduction derived from complete pooling 8 1 log separate modeling and the extended hierarchical model have in common that both the mean and the standard deviation are estimated individually for each wwtp in contrast the no pooling and classical hierarchical models estimate a common residual standard deviation after accounting for differences in the wwtp specific means since the standard deviation of the locally collected data is lower than the one derived from all data the estimation approaches which estimate the standard deviation separately lead to narrower uncertainty intervals the drinking water and irrigation scenario differ from the swimming scenario since risk calculations are based on multiple exposure events per year in contrast to the single exposure risk for swimming thus a direct comparison between prediction intervals and risk calculations is less intuitive for the drinking water scenario the lowest required log reduction is derived from separate point estimation 12 log the required log reduction derived from the remaining approaches depends on whether the median or the full uncertainty interval is used for decision making for the median the extended hierarchical modeling approach leads to a required log reduction of 12 8 log followed by 13 2 13 3 log for the classical hierarchical and no pooling approaches 14 log for complete pooling and 16 log for the separate modeling approach if decisions are based on the complete uncertainty differences are reduced to 0 5 1 log between approximately 14 log for the no pooling and the two hierarchical models in comparison to 14 8 log for complete pooling and separate modeling 16 this order generally corresponds to the width of the posterior predictive distribution shown in fig 4 a striking feature is that even a reduction by 15 log does not suffice to reduce to the median risk below the applied threshold risk of infection of 10 4 per person per year for the separate modeling approach moreover the increase of the assumed log reduction reduces the median calculated risk quite linearly for all estimation approaches except from separate modeling see fig a2 in the si for separate modeling only the uncertainty interval increases but the calculated median risk stays between 10 1 and 1 per person per year fig 6 while this behavior seems counterintuitive at first it can be explained by investigating fig 4 in combination with the applied dose response relationship and the corresponding exposure scenarios see si from fig 4 it can be deduced that the probability of simulating a single observation which is larger than 1015 gc l is as low as 10 2 75 0 00178 for the separate modeling approach with an assumed log reduction of 15 these probabilities correspond to the event of ingesting at least 1 virus in a single event while these probabilities seem very low it has to be considered that for the annual average risk 365 samples are taken which increases the probability of ingesting at least 1 virus particle per year to 0 48 as the probability of infection by ingesting a single virus particle is already 0 27 and rapidly increases to 0 5 with increasing dose the calculated median risk stays between 10 1 and 1 even for a log reduction of 15 the large difference between the result from separate point estimation 12 log and separate modeling 15 log underlines the high importance of explicitly addressing parameter uncertainty in microbial risk simulation a further interesting observation is that the monte carlo error is largest for the drinking water scenario this is not related to the small sample size but to the narrower confidence intervals of the annual risk distribution caused by 365 samples per year in comparison to 50 and 1 respectively risk calculations of the median annual risk for the irrigation scenario show similar behavior as the drinking water scenario uncertainty intervals are generally wider fig a3 in si due to the lower number of exposure events per year which lead to a less step curve in fig 7 and a smaller monte carlo error if the median is used for decision making differences between approaches lie between 0 5 and 1 log with separate point estimation leading to the lowest required log reduction followed by the two hierarchical approaches complete pooling no pooling and finally separate modeling however if the 95 uncertainty boundary is used the difference between separate modeling and the extended hierarchical modeling approach increases to up to 2 8 log the extended hierarchical model lies in turn 0 8 log below the complete pooling approach this underlines the benefits of applying a flexible approach like bhm which integrates both literature and local information interestingly the location of the median risk derived from separate point estimation and the two hierarchical modeling approaches fall below the median risk of the complete pooling approach even though their inferred means cf fig 2 are above the mean derived from complete pooling this can be explained by the larger standard deviation of the complete pooling approach in combination with the effect of multiple annual exposures 50 exposure events per year i e resampling as already described for the drinking water scenario 3 3 model comparison and generalized estimates for new wwtps fig 8 shows the generalized estimates for new data prediction interval and the uncertainty about the mean of a new unobserved wwtp simulated from the estimates for η and τ for the hierarchical approaches and µnov and σnov for the complete pooling approach an interesting observation is the width of the uncertainty intervals regarding the prediction of a new mean novii concentration at an unknown wwtp as the complete pooling approach assumes that all data come from a comparable wwtp the between wwtp variability is not specifically addressed the location of the mean and the standard error are estimated from all data this leads to an elevated mean value and narrow confidence intervals in comparison to the hierarchical modeling approaches the narrow confidence interval however is not consistent with the high between wwtp variability present in the empirical data in contrast the 95 uncertainty intervals derived from hierarchical modeling cover 96 45 47 of the observed empirical means thus the two approaches provide a more uncertain but also more realistic estimate of the existing between wwtp variability the calculated expected log predictive density also supports the advantage of the two hierarchical modeling approaches over the complete pooling approach fig 9 results show that in the presented case the extended hierarchical model is expected to produce the most accurate predictions of novii concentrations the classical hierarchical model and the no pooling approach lead to similar results whereas the complete pooling approach is expected to deliver the worst predictive accuracy in comparison to the other estimation approaches 4 discussion in the present study we investigated the effect of including external information from the scientific literature on local estimates using bhm based on the case of novii concentrations in the influent of municipal wwtps to the best of our knowledge such an approach to quantitatively combine local and external information to reduce parameter uncertainty on a local level has not been conducted so far in the qmra literature in the literature two major meta analyses were identified that address concentrations of novii eftim et al 2017 pouillot et al 2015 in wwtps using different statistical approaches bootstrapping hierarchical modeling however in both studies the focus was put on the derivation of generalizable estimates of novii concentrations instead of investigating the effect on a local scale our results showed that the benefit of incorporating external information is largest in situations where local data are sparse n 4 n 7 in such situations parameter uncertainty would be so large that no reliable estimate of concentrations and log reductions would be possible without the use of external information our results also showed that even a small sample size in combination with external information might contribute valuable information to reduce the estimate of the required log reduction to reasonable values the fact that even small sample sizes affect estimates in hierarchical modeling is an indication that the between wwtp variability is high and only little pooling occurs reasons for the high between wwtp variability may include differences in population size season climate incidence in the population and analytical methods and protocols this shows that nov concentrations from a single wwtp should not directly be used to inform assumptions about nov concentration at other locations however since the degree of pooling that occurs in bayesian hierarchical modeling depends on the between wwtp variability this fact is accounted for and only little information is shared between wwtps thus employing this technique reduces the risk of not accounting for these variations by imposing too strong assumptions or pooling over interesting features in the dataset while a data set of four data points at wwtp 101 for which the effect was largest is extremely small small sample sizes at single locations are not uncommon in the qmra literature for example mcbride et al 2013 conducted a discharge based qmra study and measured pathogens in stormwater from catchments with different characteristics within each catchment type the sample size per site varied between 8 samples at 8 sites for dry season urban runoff i e 1 sample per site to 7 samples at 1 site for forested open space stormwater for the remaining catchment types sample sizes varied between 3 and 4 samples per site amoueyan et al 2019 used novii surface water concentration published by lodder and de roda husman 2005 for a qmra based comparison of direct potable reuse and unintentional de facto reuse in the latter publication 8 novii observations are reported which were collected at two rivers in the netherlands 4 observations at each river thus the situation of relying only on a couple of observations can be regarded as a realistic scenario for which hierarchical modeling might be a suitable and transparent solution for addressing and potentially reducing parameter uncertainty moreover this information might also be of high practical relevance for applied risk based decision making because operators may be confronted with the decision about whether to take additional efforts to collect local data or to plan potentially necessary risk reduction measures based on the available body of knowledge provided by the scientific literature or guideline documents our results show that even small sample sizes might be beneficial in combination with external information and might lead to lower required log reduction i e less resource depletion and cost in comparison to e g a complete pooling approach however it is important to underline that small sample sizes are only beneficial if they are combined with external information otherwise parameter uncertainty is too high our results also show that bayesian hierarchical modeling allows for making generalizable estimates about new locations in our case wwtps which explicitly account for the between location variability of model parameters as a result the predictions of a new mean µ becomes much wider than if a complete pooling approach is applied our prediction for a unknown mean influent concentration at an unknown wwtp covers a range between 3 5 and 6 5 interestingly if this range which is derived only from european wwtp is compared to the estimates reported by eftim et al 2017 for differences between geographic regions all of the estimates reported by eftim north america europe asia new zealand fall inside the derived prediction interval of the present study therefore the statistically significant difference between nov concentrations in north america in comparison to the ones in asia and europe reported in eftim et al 2017 has to be regarded with caution because it might only be an artifact of the statistical procedure which does not account for the between wwtp variability more generally the question about appropriate methods for selecting one statistical model over the other for summarizing information via meta analysis deserves more attention in our study we used the pointwise expected log predictive density as a quantitative indication which statistical model might be the most accurate such or similar approaches like the application of information criteria might be reasonable ways to make decisions about which modeling approach to apply more transparent one additional advantage we see when using bayesian hierarchical modeling is that in contrast to complete pooling the generalized estimates from µ and σ represented by the estimates for η τ α and γ in eq 5 may function as a prior distribution for subsequent studies that means that knowledge can be transferred by reporting only the parameterization of the priors for µ and σ which can function as a starting point for subsequent updates this feature might be potentially interesting because collecting raw data by contacting authors or digitalizing them from graphs is very time consuming especially in comparison to methods like bootstrapping which always requires the full raw data set communicating a generalized prior for subsequent analysis might be a promising way to ease the use of literature information by subsequent studies for illustration we fitted the extended hierarchical model to the literature data only and subsequently updated the deduced informative prior using the local data fig 10 parameter values differ slightly from the complete analysis as the data from the other two local wwtp are not included in the prior it can be seen that as for the complete analysis parameter uncertainty can be reduced substantially in low data situations 100 101 while estimates are not affected if the local information is strong 102 moreover while our study used the simple example of fitting a mean and standard deviation of a lognormal distribution bhm can readily be extended to the estimation of other model parameters like e g the slopes in a regression model 5 conclusion bayesian hierarchical modeling allows for reducing local parameter uncertainty in comparison to separate modeling while being flexible enough to let local data dominate local estimates in contrast to e g complete pooling external information provided e g by published meta analyses helps to reduce local parameter estimates and should be considered to be included quantitatively into qmra studies even when local data is available in cases of limited sample sizes parameter uncertainty may be too large to make reasonable inferences based on local data alone therefore parameter uncertainty should be considered explicitly in future qmra studies in combination with external information already small local data sets may help to reduce the required log performance in local settings and justifies additional measurements before planning suitable risk reduction measures model comparison and selection methods like e g information criteria or the expected log predictive density should be considered in future

17592,water contamination with the enteroprotozoan parasite cryptosporidium is a current challenge worldwide solar water disinfection sodis has been proved as a potential alternative for its inactivation especially at household level in low income environments this work presents the first comprehensive kinetic model for the inactivation of cryptosporidium parvum oocysts by sunlight that based on the mechanism of the process is able to describe not only the individual thermal and spectral actions but also their synergy model predictions are capable of estimating the required solar exposure to achieve the desired level of disinfection under variable solar spectral irradiance and environmental temperature conditions for different locations worldwide the thermal contribution can be successfully described by a modified arrhenius equation while photoinactivation is based on a series event mechanistic model the wavelength dependent spectral effect is modeled by means of the estimation of the c parvum extinction coefficients and the determination of the quantum yield of the inactivation process model predictions show a 3 7 error with respect to experimental results carried out under a wide range of temperature 30 to 45 c and uv irradiance 0 to 50 w m 2 furthermore the model was validated in three scenarios in which the spectral distribution radiation was modified using different plastic materials common in sodis devices ensuring accurate forecasting of inactivation rates for real conditions graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords solar

cryptosporidium is a universal challenge efstratiou et al 2017 hamilton et al 2018 hofstra and vermeulen 2016 karanis et al 2007 based on who reports who 2015 there were approximately 64 million of estimated cases of illness caused by cryptosporidium and 35 of them were related to contact with contaminated water sources moreover cryptosporidiosis has a worldwide distribution in developed countries prevalence rates range from 0 3 to 54 2 mainly related to recreational or drinking water abeywardena et al 2015 and reported because of the existence of surveillance systems for routine detection of cryptosporidium cacciò and putignani 2014 furthermore water bodies may also be contaminated by sewage or effluents from wastewater treatment plants wwtp whose treatments are insufficient to achieve the total removal of cryptosporidium oocysts nasser 2016 vermeulen et al 2019 however the prevalence is assumed to be higher in developing countries putignani and menichella 2010 in these regions cryptosporidium is one of the top three pathogens causing diarrheal disease in children under two years old and it is responsible for 30 50 of childhood mortality kotloff et al 2013 estimated in 455 000 deaths in sub saharan region sow et al 2016 the risk of infection by cryptosporidium through drinking water can be reduced by key intervention methods such as appropriate selection and protection of the catchment and the installation of an effective filtration step and disinfection by uv c betancourt and rose 2004 swaffer et al 2018 however developing countries cannot afford the use of advanced technologies and demand low cost water disinfection processes solar water disinfection sodis is a low cost easy to use and sustainable process to conduct water treatment at the household level this process is especially interesting for countries where high solar doses are received all around the year this process commonly carried out by the exposure to sunlight of 2 l polyethylene terephthalate pet bottles for 6 h is based on the harmful damage of the uv solar radiation and high temperatures on microorganisms and has been successfully tested for the removal of viruses bacteria and protozoa including cryptosporidium parvum wegelin et al 1994 mcguigan et al 2012 gómez couso et al 2012 1998 at present sodis is one of the recommended methods for disinfection of household drinking water who unicef 2005 solar inactivation of c parvum in pure water is dominated by direct endogenous damage caused by uv b absorption by genome since the c parvum action spectrum resembles that of the dna absorption busse et al 2019 liu et al 2015 this similarity also confirms the wavelength dependence for the photoinactivation of c parvum oocysts beck et al 2015 busse et al 2019 linden et al 2001 recently busse et al 2019 applied the series event model severin et al 1983 that assumes stepwise units of damage until a threshold amount is accumulated to obtain the relative inactivation constant as a function of wavelength actually the spectral dependence suggests the interest of the potential substitution of pet for other sodis container materials with higher uv b transmittance garcía gil et al 2020a this work describes for the first time the kinetic modeling of the synergistic effect of the photonic and thermal effects on the inactivation of c parvum oocysts the developed model provides an accurate estimation of the required exposure time for the solar inactivation of this protozoon depending on the radiation intensity available spectral range and water temperature application of the model predictions allows the calculation of sodis treatment time needed to provide safe drinking water from the protozoan point of view whose higher resistance also ensures the elimination of other less resistant waterborne pathogens 2 materials and methods 2 1 cryptosporidium parvum oocysts cryptosporidium oocysts were collected from a naturally infected neonatal friesian holstein calf concentration 0 04 m phosphate buffered saline pbs ph 7 2 and diethyl ether purification discontinuous caesium chloride gradients quantification neubauer haemacytometer and molecular characterization were performed as previously reported gómez couso et al 2012 briefly feces were collected from a calf by rectal sampling and stored at 5 c fecal material was then homogenised in 10 20

two layers were removed carefully and discarded and the sediment was washed with pbs 0 04 m ph 7 2 by centrifugation at 2000 g for 15 min at 4 c cryptosporidium oocysts were purified on discontinuous caesium chloride gradients of 1 05 1 10 and 1 40 g ml 1 by centrifugation at 2000 g for 30 min at 4 c finally the oocysts were counted in a modified neubauer haemocytometer with 0 16 malachite green solution as counterstain kilani and sekla 1987 lorenzo lorenzo et al 1993 the isolate was identified as c parvum by pcr amplification and sequence analysis of a 587 bp fragment of the small subunit rdna gene ssurdna ryan et al 2003 2 1 1 viability assays the viability of c parvum oocysts was determined by inclusion exclusion of the fluorogenic vital dye propidium iodide pi and a further modification that includes an immunofluorescence antibody test to verify oocyst identification campbell et al 1992 dowd and pillai 1997 briefly 200 μl of the sediments were incubated with 15 μl of pi

waterborne inc new orleans louisiana usa at 37 c for 30 min gómez couso et al 2012 then the samples were washed three times in pbs 0 04 m ph 7 2 at 10 000 g for 5 min at room temperature oocysts were identified first under a fitc filter excitation at 450 480 nm barrier at 515 nm before being examined for pi inclusion exclusion under a pi filter excitation at 510 550 nm barrier at 590 nm the proportions of ruptured ghost pi positive dead and pi negative viable oocysts were quantified in an epifluorescence microscope equipped with a nomarski differential interference contrast fitc and pi filters olympus ax70 olympus optical co ltd tokyo japan the results are shown as the concentration of pi negative viable oocysts determined for each assay after triplicate counts of more than 100 oocysts 2 2 experimental design three sets of experiments were conducted in the first set experiments were carried out at different water temperatures 30 40 42 43 44 and 45 c in the dark to quantify the dark thermal inactivation of c parvum oocysts in the second set inactivation experiments were performed using different uv irradiances 30 40 and 50 w m 2 and water temperatures 30 40 and 44 c to determine the contribution of the irradiance effect and its synergistic effect with water temperature in the third set experiments for the validation of the developed model predictions were carried out using plastic sheets placed between the illumination source and the water to test the wavelength dependence potential materials for the manufacture of sodis containers garcía gil et al 2020a were selected based on their different uv b transmittances polyethylene terephthalate pet polypropylene pp and polymethylmethacrylate pmma for the three scenarios three experiments were conducted i 50 w m

experiments were carried out in a solar simulator atlas suntest cps atlas material testing technology gmbh lisengericht germany equipped with a 1100 w air cooled xenon arc lamp and a combination of filters suprax atlas material testing technology gmbh to simulate the outdoor solar radiation spectrum the irradiance was measured with a radiometer pma2100 fitted with a pma2107 digital non weighted uv a b sensor 280 400 nm solar light company inc glenside pennsylvania usa an open reaction jacketed borosilicate beaker 135 75 mm containing 400 ml of distilled water ph 6 1 conductivity 10 µs cm 1 organic carbon 0 5 mg l 1 was spiked with 75 000 oocysts ml 1 of c parvum and exposed to artificial solar light at the established intensities of radiation and temperatures for a maximum exposure time of 6 h the exterior of the reactor was completely black to avoid uncontrolled light reflections and guarantee that only the measured direct radiation participates in the process in order to maintain the temperature of the water sample during the experiments the reactor was connected to a refrigerated and heated bath circulator fisherbrand isotemp 4100 r20 thermo fisher scientific inc waltham massachusetts usa constant stirring of 250 rpm was kept during the experiments to ensure a homogeneous concentration of c parvum oocysts at different exposure times 14 ml of the sample was removed and centrifuged at 2000 g 15 c for 15 min the supernatant was discarded and the sediment thus obtained was resuspended in 500 µl of phosphate buffered saline pbs 0 04 m ph 7 2 and used to evaluate the oocyst viability all tests were performed in duplicate 2 3 kinetic modeling kinetic parameters were estimated using different datasets obtained for the different submodels after replicated experiments i dark thermal inactivation ii uv irradiance effect iii uv radiation temperature synergistic effect and iv wavelength dependent spectral action 2 3 1 dark thermal inactivation experimental data of inactivation in the dark were fitted to a first order kinetic model eq 1 and eq 2 1 d c d t k t c 2 ln c c 0 k t t where c 0 is the initial concentration of the c parvum oocysts ml 1 c is the concentration at a specific time t and kt is the thermal inactivation kinetic constant the effect of the water temperature t on the thermal inactivation kinetic constant kt was modeled by the arrhenius equation arrhenius 1889 with a threshold temperature eq 3 3 k t k t 0 exp e a t r 1 t 1 t 0 where k t 0 is the temperature independent pre exponential factor e a t is the activation energy r is the universal gas constant and t 0 is the threshold temperature as peleg et al 2012 demonstrated the threshold temperature can be suppressed which involves a different value of k t 0 for the same value of kt however the present model kept the t 0 as a conceptual threshold to account for the temperature above which the thermal effect is observed the kinetic parameters of the model k t 0 and e a t r have been calculated by minimizing the normalized root mean square error nrmse between the predicted and observed concentration of viable c parvum oocysts using a constrained nonlinear multivariable optimization algorithm employing the add in solver of excel 2016 software microsoft corp redmond washington usa 2 3 2 uv irradiance effect the presence of a shoulder in the experimental photoinactivation curves suggests the application of a series event kinetic model severin et al 1983 to reproduce the experimental data this model assumes that an event is a unit of damage and n units of damage must be accumulated to inactivate the microorganisms therefore the inactivation process takes place through a sequence of inactivation levels n in the population balance of microorganisms at level i 1 i n the damaged organisms from the previous level are considered as a source positive term and the damaged organisms at the current level are considered as a sink negative term this balance is represented by eq 4 4 d c i d t k r a d i c i 1 k r a d i c i where ci is the concentration of viable c parvum oocysts oocysts ml 1 at level i at a specific time t c i 1 is the concentration of viable c parvum oocysts oocysts ml 1 at the previous level krad is the photoinactivation constant and i is the uv irradiance w m 2 the values of n and krad were calculated minimizing the normalized root mean square logarithmic error nrmsle between experimental and predicted concentrations of viable c parvum oocysts over time in experiments without thermal effect 30 c of water temperature using a constrained nonlinear multivariable optimization algorithm employing the add in solver of excel 2016 software microsoft corp 2 3 3 uv radiation temperature synergistic effect to account for this synergistic effect in the model krad from eq 4 was redefined with the arrhenius equation eq 5 5 k r a d k r a d 0 exp e a r a d r 1 t 1 t 0 where k r a d 0 is the temperature independent pre exponential factor and e a r a d is the activation energy the kinetic parameters of the model k r a d 0 e a r a d r n k t 0 and e a t r were recalculated minimizing the nrmsle between the predicted and observed values of the kinetic constants using the sequential quadratic programming sqp nonlinear optimization tool implemented in gnu octave platform www octave org the values of the kinetic parameters previously calculated in the previous submodels were used as seeds for the optimization 2 3 4 wavelength dependent spectral action finally to describe c parvum sensitivity to solar inactivation as a function of wavelength a quantum yield ϕ cp was defined as the ratio between the number of damaged oocysts and the number of absorbed photons to determine the rate of photon absorption the absorption spectrum for a single oocyst was defined like mattle et al 2015 previously did for adenovirus ms2 and phix174 viruses as busse et al 2019 demonstrated absorption of solar light by c parvum is dominated by the nucleic acid components since the action spectrum is similar in shape to the dna absorption spectrum with a maximum around 260 nm the absorbance at 260 nm can be calculated by multiplying the weight of dsdna in c parvum by the weight normalized extinction coefficient of the dsdna at 260 nm ɛ cp 260nm reported as 0 020 ml µg 1 cm 1 gallagher 2011 the weight of the dna of c parvum was calculated following data deposited in national center for biotechnology information ncbi reference cm000429 1 national center for biotechnology information 2020 and corresponds to 9 51 10 10 µg the absorption spectrum for c parvum was determined by considering the shape of the absorption spectrum of a c parvum oocyst suspension measured by busse et al 2019 and kindly provided by the authors upon request a 5 point smoothing was applied to the spectrum data in the range from 240 to 400 nm and the values were normalized to the absorption at 260 nm the final results of the spectral extinction coefficients of a single c parvum oocyst ɛcp λ ml oocyst 1cm 1 are shown in table s2 as a result the photoinactivation kinetic parameter can be expressed according to eq 6 6 k r a d 0 i ϕ cp λ ε cp λ i λ λ h c d λ where λ h c photon j 1 converts the energy units of the spectral irradiance i λ to the photonic units where h is the planck s constant and c is the speed of light in vacuum the value of the quantum yield ϕ cp can be calculated by resolution of eq 6 3 results and discussion 3 1 dark thermal inactivation data from experiments in dark conditions were evaluated at water temperatures commonly achieved during solar exposure of water 30 40 42 43 44 and 45 c experimental results shown in fig s1 confirm a noticeable effect of temperature the experiment at 30 c being the only case in which inactivation did not happen for this reason the threshold temperature of the arrhenius equation t 0 in eq 3 was set to 30 c 303 k the experimental results two replicates in all cases were fitted to a first order kinetic model eq 1 and the values of the kinetic constant were used to calculate the provisional values of the thermal kinetic parameters k t 0 1 12 10 4 h 1 and e a t r 4 37 105 k nrmse 8 59 these parameters will be refined later with the complete set of experimental data using these provisional values as seeds predicted results of the thermal inactivation are also shown in fig s1 some reports found no effects on c parvum survival for water temperatures up to 40 c liu et al 2015 however other publications suggested that the viability of c parvum decreases progressively for temperatures in the range from 30 to 50 c due to the melting point of the fatty acids and hydrocarbons present in the oocyst wall and the increase in the metabolic activity fayer and nerad 1996 jenkins et al 2010 king et al 2005 peng et al 2008 furthermore temperatures above 37 c can induce the phenomenon of spontaneous excystation of c parvum oocysts making their survival impossible in the absence of a host gómez couso et al 2009 smith et al 2005 however these phenomena do not necessarily follow a pure arrhenius behavior what can explain the small deviations observed in experiments at 40 and 42 c 3 2 uv irradiance effect data from c parvum inactivation experiments under illumination uv irradiance of 30 40 and 50 w m 2 at a temperature of 30 c to neglect thermal effects were fitted to a series event model eq 4 calculation of the kinetic parameters n 8 and krad 4 05 10 2 m2 w 1 h 1 was carried out by fitting the experimental data with an nrmsle of 2 44 see fig s2 1 the direct coupling of the dark thermal inactivation model with the uv irradiance model failed to predict the inactivation of c parvum at temperatures higher than 30 c figs s2 2 and s2 3 with a global value of nrmsle 17 9 the predictions clearly underestimate the experimental data showing a higher error for higher temperatures which supports the existence of a synergy between the thermal and photonic inactivation processes the existence of a strong synergistic effect between the optical and thermal processes to inactivate microorganisms is well known mcguigan et al 1998 wegelin et al 1994 and has been modeled for bacteria and viruses castro alférez et al 2017 garcía gil et al 2020b 3 3 uv radiation temperature synergistic effect the synergistic effect was included in the model through the temperature dependence of the kinetic constant of the series event model according to the modified arrhenius equation using again a value of 30 c 303 k for the temperature threshold t 0 all the kinetic parameters were recalculated using as seeds the provisional values in the previous submodels the global fitting of the whole experimental data set for the complete range of irradiances and temperatures provides the values of the final kinetic parameters n 7 k rad0 2 97 10 2 m2 w 1 h 1 e a r a d r 6 90 104 k k t 0 4 19 10 5 h 1 and e a t r 5 06 105 k with an nrmsle of 3 68 figs 1 1 1 2 1 3 and 1 4 in this case whereas the predictions of the dark thermal inactivation and the photoinactivation at 30 c are very similar the prediction of the photoinactivation at higher temperatures improves significantly 3 4 wavelength dependent spectral action the developed model which considers the synergistic effect between the uv irradiance and temperature and the independent thermal effect succeeds in reproducing the c parvum inactivation using a light source with the solar spectrum however for the same global uv irradiance if the spectral distribution of the radiation changes the effective damage can also dramatically change the wavelength dependent spectral contribution needs to be modeled to predict the inactivation in solar disinfection containers with different transmission spectra as suggested by mattle et al 2015 the inactivation rate can be calculated by multiplying the quantum yield the concentration of microorganisms and the volumetric rate of photon absorption calculated as the integration in wavelength of the spectral microorganism extinction coefficient by the spectral irradiance for each wavelength table s2 shows the c parvum extinction coefficients ɛcp λ calculated in this work and the spectral irradiance i λ from 280 to 400 nm for a global uv i of 50 w m 2 following eq 6 the quantum yield for c parvum inactivation with the solar simulator spectrum was calculated as ϕ cp 3 94 10 7 oocysts damaged per absorbed photon indicating that c parvum is more resistant to direct inactivation than viruses such as phix174 ms2 and adenovirus 1 4 10 2 2 9 10 3 and 2 5 10 4 virus inactivated per absorbed photon respectively mattle et al 2015 in any case it is important to notice the critical role of the calibration of the spectroradiometer used to measure the emission of the incident radiation especially in the uvb range for instance in the case of the ms2 virus different values of the quantum yield can be found in the literature 2 07 10 3 2 9 10 3 and 2 56 10 4 viruses inactivated per absorbed photon for garcía gil et al 2020b mattle et al 2015 and silverman et al 2019 respectively the reason for these apparent discrepancies is the high sensibility of the results to the experimental data provided by the spectroradiometer basically each quantum yield value worked well in the framework of the spectral measurements from which it was derived in this sense the use of quantum yields reported in the literature should be carefully selected and the calculation for each specific device is always recommended 3 5 validation of the model the developed model is able to predict the inactivation of c parvum oocysts depending on the water temperature irradiance and spectral distribution of the incident light allowing the estimation of the required inactivation times for different locations around the world additionally the model has also a particular strength the capability of estimating required solar exposure time when solar water disinfection is performed in containers made of any material with a known transmission spectrum to validate this strength experiments were carried out using plastic materials of different uv b transmittance pet pp and pmma and combining two levels of global uv irradiance 30 and 50 w m 2 and water temperature 30 and 44 c in three experiments the experiment with the lowest values of both variables was neglected figs 2 1 2 2 and 2 3 show the comparison between the observed and the predicted inactivation profiles of c parvum oocysts versus the exposure time for the pet pp and pmma scenarios considering the fully predictive nature of the model inactivation curves they are not fitting results the agreement can be considered very good with values of nrmsle of 5 54 5 72 and 11 68 for pet pp and pmma respectively the results can be easily interpreted based on the different uv transmission of the materials 1 44 and 57 in the global uv b range and 59 60 and 86 in the uv a range for pet pp and pmma respectively the radiation transmitted and the c parvum extinction coefficients versus wavelength are shown in fig 3 data in table s2 as can be observed the uv b is the critical region in which the c parvum absorption mainly overlaps with the spectrum of the incident radiation and therefore the uv b transmission will be very significant in the c parvum photoinactivation however as shown fig 3 the emission of the solar simulator overestimates the irradiance of the standard am 1 5 solar spectrum especially in the 280 300 nm range where the process is very sensitive consequently under real sunlight pp and pmma would be expected to perform slightly worse for the pp and pmma scenarios the photoinactivation is possible being higher for the plastic with the higher transmission pmma the thermal effect and the irradiance effect can be observed in both cases for experiments at the same global uv irradiance and the same water temperature respectively in the case of pet plastic that essentially does not transmit uv b radiation the thermal contribution is almost the only damage source in pure water achieving at simple sight the same disinfection rate for different values of global uv irradiance model predictions for 30 and 50 w m 2 at 44 c seem to be the same the type of photodamage can be direct or indirect nelson et al 2018 direct damage is due to the absorption of radiation by genome dna in this case and is mainly initiated by photons in the uv b range the indirect damage is caused when an external or internal photosensitizer that can absorb uv b radiation as well as uv a and visible radiation produces photo produced reactive intermediates ppri that damage the microorganisms i e reactive oxidative species ros nelson et al 2018 the absence of external sensitizers experiments carried out in distillate water and the negligible inactivation with only uv a and visible radiation at low temperature pet scenario at 30 c leads to think that c parvum cannot be damage by endogenous indirect damage produced by internal photosensitizers however king et al 2010 were unable to readily detect cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers formation or dna damage in oocysts exhibiting similar or greater levels of inactivation by solar uv but they proved that solar uv radiation induces sporozoite membrane depolarization resulting in reduced cellular atp and increased cytosolic calcium accompanied by a reduction in the internal granularity of sporozoites indicative of apical organelle discharge and sporozoite exocytosis resulting in a significant reduction in the ability of sporozoites to attach and invade host cells other authors confirm that the presence of natural organic matter nom one of the known photosensitizers did not improve the inactivation likely due to the resistance of the thick oocyst wall to exogenous inactivation liu et al 2015 furthermore in the case of using high volume containers the damage produced by the external ppri can be completely overshadowed by the role of the sensitizers as attenuators of radiation garcía gil et al 2020c moreover only for the temperature higher than 30 c the thermal effect is noticeable these facts confirm two things the threshold on the thermal inactivation set to 30 c and the dominant mechanism of c parvum photoinactivation by the direct damage caused by the uv b photons absorption by dna thus it also means that the solar water disinfection of c parvum in common containers of pet with pure water is practically possible because of thermal inactivation however reached temperature during solar water disinfection easily rises up to 30 c dejung et al 2007 gómez couso et al 2010 in the present study the survival of c parvum oocysts were determined by the inclusion exclusion of the fluorogenic vital dye pi an indicator of the integrity and permeability of the oocyst wall campbell et al 1992 which may be affected during sodis procedures mcguigan et al 2006 this staining method is quick simple non expensive and provides useful information in studies on the influence of environmental factors pressures as the temperature and radiation on the survival of cryptosporidium spp oocysts however this technique overestimates the oocyst infectivity in comparison with cell culture methods and bioassays in murine models adeyemo et al 2018 robertson and gjerde 2007 providing a safety margin in the water treatment by sodis which will benefit the microbiological quality of the treated water and in protecting consumer health moreover it should be considered that in those geographical regions where the who recommends the use of sodis as an alternative method of disinfection to guarantee the safety of water destined for human consumption the levels of water turbidity varied widely depending on weather conditions and time of collection the turbidity of water in some areas can vary between 5 and 2000 ntu daily joyce et al 1996 laboratory experiments have shown that in water samples of turbidity higher than 200 ntu less than 1 of the total incident ultraviolet light uv penetrates further than a depth of 2 cm from the surface joyce et al 1996 in this case the role of temperature in the inactivation of c parvum oocysts is more crucial and therefore the viability values determined by the inclusion exclusion of fluorogenic vital dyes will be very similar to the infectivity values detected using a murine model or a cell culture also in a previous study in which the combined effects of solar radiation intensity water turbidity and exposure time on the survival of c parvum oocysts during simulated sodis exposure were investigated it was showed that only in those cases in which the infectivity was not 100 the values of oocyst viability obtained by the inclusion exclusion of pi were slightly higher than the corresponding values obtained with a neonatal murine model gómez couso et al 2009 4 conclusions a novel comprehensive kinetic model for the inactivation of c parvum in clear water by solar light has been developed the model considers the solar irradiance water temperature the photonic thermal synergistic effect and the specific sensibility of c parvum to the spectral distribution of radiation a threshold temperature of 30 c is considered in the model for the dark thermal inactivation of c parvum being this process especially significant above 40 c uv radiation also leads to the inactivation being the efficacy strongly affected by the spectral distribution of the incident light as c parvum inactivation in mainly driven by photons in the uv b range the quantum yield of the photonic process has been calculated from experimental data and the spectral extinction coefficients of c parvum has been also determined these values reflect the strong sensitivity of the process to the spectral distribution of the incident light in agreement with the biological mechanism of cryptosporidium oocyst inactivation based on the direct absorption of photons by the nucleic acids the joint action of temperature and radiation leads to a strong synergistic effect that improves the efficacy of the process the incorporation of this synergistic effect in the model gives very meaningful predictions with an average fitting error of the experimental data of only 3 7 finally the predictions of this comprehensive model have been successfully validated with experimental data from three different scenarios of variable temperature and spectral transmission in the uv range predictions of solar inactivation using pet pp and pmma materials led to errors of 5 5 5 7 and 11 7 respectively therefore the developed model constitutes a powerful tool for the predictive evaluation of c parvum inactivation rate under different solar spectral irradiance and environmental temperature conditions for any location worldwide applications range from the estimation of the natural inactivation in the environment to the technical design of solar water disinfection processes for drinking water supply including the spectral transmission of the materials however because sodis procedures can be implemented in different geographical regions it is recommended to carry out experiments in order to adjust the model to local conditions

17592,water contamination with the enteroprotozoan parasite cryptosporidium is a current challenge worldwide solar water disinfection sodis has been proved as a potential alternative for its inactivation especially at household level in low income environments this work presents the first comprehensive kinetic model for the inactivation of cryptosporidium parvum oocysts by sunlight that based on the mechanism of the process is able to describe not only the individual thermal and spectral actions but also their synergy model predictions are capable of estimating the required solar exposure to achieve the desired level of disinfection under variable solar spectral irradiance and environmental temperature conditions for different locations worldwide the thermal contribution can be successfully described by a modified arrhenius equation while photoinactivation is based on a series event mechanistic model the wavelength dependent spectral effect is modeled by means of the estimation of the c parvum extinction coefficients and the determination of the quantum yield of the inactivation process model predictions show a 3 7 error with respect to experimental results carried out under a wide range of temperature 30 to 45 c and uv irradiance 0 to 50 w m 2 furthermore the model was validated in three scenarios in which the spectral distribution radiation was

cryptosporidium is a universal challenge efstratiou et al 2017 hamilton et al 2018 hofstra and vermeulen 2016 karanis et al 2007 based on who reports who 2015 there were approximately 64 million of estimated cases of illness caused by cryptosporidium and 35 of them were related to contact with contaminated water sources moreover cryptosporidiosis has a worldwide distribution in developed countries prevalence rates range from 0 3 to 54 2 mainly related to recreational or drinking water abeywardena et al 2015 and reported because of the existence of surveillance systems for routine detection of cryptosporidium cacciò and putignani 2014 furthermore water bodies may also be contaminated by sewage or effluents from wastewater treatment plants wwtp whose treatments are insufficient to achieve the total removal of cryptosporidium oocysts nasser 2016 vermeulen et al 2019 however the prevalence is assumed to be higher in developing countries putignani and menichella 2010 in these regions cryptosporidium is one of the top three pathogens causing diarrheal disease in children under two years old and it is responsible for 30 50 of childhood mortality kotloff et al 2013 estimated in 455 000 deaths in sub saharan region sow et al 2016 the risk of infection by cryptosporidium through drinking water can be reduced by key intervention methods such as appropriate selection and protection of the catchment and the installation of an effective filtration step and disinfection by uv c betancourt and rose 2004 swaffer et al 2018 however developing countries cannot afford the use of advanced technologies and demand low cost water disinfection processes solar water disinfection sodis is a low cost easy to use and sustainable process to conduct water treatment at the household level this process is especially interesting for countries where high solar doses are received all around the year this process commonly carried out by the exposure to sunlight of 2 l polyethylene terephthalate pet bottles for 6 h is based on the harmful damage of the uv solar radiation and high temperatures on microorganisms and has been successfully tested for the removal of viruses bacteria and protozoa including cryptosporidium parvum wegelin et al 1994 mcguigan et al 2012 gómez couso et al 2012 1998 at present sodis is one of the recommended methods for disinfection of household drinking water who unicef 2005 solar inactivation of c parvum in pure water is dominated by direct endogenous damage caused by uv b absorption by genome since the c parvum action spectrum resembles that of the dna absorption busse et al 2019 liu et al 2015 this similarity also confirms the wavelength dependence for the photoinactivation of c parvum oocysts beck et al 2015 busse et al 2019 linden et al 2001 recently busse et al 2019 applied the series event model severin et al 1983 that assumes stepwise units of damage until a threshold amount is accumulated to obtain the relative inactivation constant as a function of wavelength actually the spectral dependence suggests the interest of the potential substitution of pet for other sodis container materials with higher uv b transmittance garcía gil et al 2020a this work describes for the first time the kinetic modeling of the synergistic effect of the photonic and thermal effects on the inactivation of c parvum oocysts the developed model provides an accurate estimation of the required exposure time for the solar inactivation of this protozoon depending on the radiation intensity available spectral range and water temperature application of the model predictions allows the calculation of sodis treatment time needed to provide safe drinking water from the protozoan point of view whose higher resistance also ensures the elimination of other less resistant waterborne pathogens 2 materials and methods 2 1 cryptosporidium parvum oocysts cryptosporidium oocysts were collected from a naturally infected neonatal friesian holstein calf concentration 0 04 m phosphate buffered saline pbs ph 7 2 and diethyl ether purification discontinuous caesium chloride gradients quantification neubauer haemacytometer and molecular characterization were performed as previously reported gómez couso et al 2012 briefly feces were collected from a calf by rectal sampling and stored at 5 c fecal material was then homogenised in 10 20

caesium chloride gradients of 1 05 1 10 and 1 40 g ml 1 by centrifugation at 2000 g for 30 min at 4 c finally the oocysts were counted in a modified neubauer haemocytometer with 0 16 malachite green

waterborne inc new orleans louisiana usa at 37 c for 30 min gómez couso et al 2012 then the samples were washed three times in pbs 0 04 m ph 7 2 at 10 000 g for 5 min at room temperature oocysts were identified first under a fitc filter excitation at 450 480 nm barrier at 515 nm before being examined for pi inclusion exclusion under a pi filter excitation at 510 550 nm barrier at 590 nm the proportions of ruptured ghost pi positive dead and pi negative viable oocysts were quantified in an epifluorescence microscope equipped with a nomarski differential interference contrast fitc and pi filters olympus ax70 olympus optical co ltd tokyo japan the results are shown as the concentration of pi negative viable oocysts determined for each assay after triplicate counts of more than 100 oocysts 2 2 experimental design three sets of experiments were conducted in the first set experiments were carried out at different water temperatures 30 40 42 43 44 and 45 c in the dark to quantify the dark thermal inactivation of c parvum oocysts in the second set inactivation experiments were performed using different uv irradiances 30 40 and 50 w m 2 and water temperatures 30 40 and 44 c to determine the contribution of the irradiance effect and its synergistic effect with water temperature in the third set experiments for the validation of the developed model predictions were carried out using plastic sheets placed between the illumination source and the water to test the wavelength dependence potential materials for the manufacture of sodis containers garcía gil et al 2020a were selected based on their different uv b transmittances polyethylene terephthalate pet polypropylene pp and polymethylmethacrylate pmma for the three scenarios three experiments were conducted i 50 w m

experiments were carried out in a solar simulator atlas suntest cps atlas material testing technology gmbh lisengericht germany equipped with a 1100 w air cooled xenon arc lamp and a combination of filters suprax atlas material testing technology gmbh to simulate the outdoor solar radiation spectrum the irradiance was measured with a radiometer pma2100 fitted with a pma2107 digital non weighted uv a b sensor 280 400 nm solar light company inc glenside pennsylvania usa an open reaction jacketed borosilicate beaker 135 75 mm containing 400 ml of distilled water ph 6 1 conductivity 10 µs cm 1 organic carbon 0 5 mg l 1 was spiked with 75 000 oocysts ml 1 of c parvum and exposed to artificial solar light at the established intensities of radiation and temperatures for a maximum exposure time of 6 h the exterior of the reactor was completely black to avoid uncontrolled light reflections and guarantee that only the measured direct radiation participates in the process in order to maintain the temperature of the water sample during the experiments the reactor was connected to a refrigerated and heated bath circulator fisherbrand isotemp 4100 r20 thermo fisher scientific inc waltham massachusetts usa constant stirring of 250 rpm was kept during the experiments to ensure a homogeneous concentration of c parvum oocysts at different exposure times 14 ml of the sample was removed and centrifuged at 2000 g 15 c for 15 min the supernatant was discarded and the sediment thus obtained was resuspended in 500 µl of phosphate buffered saline pbs 0 04 m ph 7 2 and used to evaluate the oocyst viability all tests were performed in duplicate 2 3 kinetic modeling kinetic parameters were estimated using different datasets obtained for the different submodels after replicated experiments i dark thermal inactivation ii uv irradiance effect iii uv radiation temperature synergistic effect and iv wavelength dependent spectral action 2 3 1 dark thermal inactivation experimental data of inactivation in the dark were fitted to a first order kinetic model eq 1 and eq 2 1 d c d t k t c 2 ln c c 0 k t t where c 0 is the initial concentration of the c parvum oocysts ml 1 c is the concentration at a specific time t and kt is the thermal inactivation kinetic constant the effect of the water temperature t on the thermal inactivation kinetic constant kt was modeled by the arrhenius equation arrhenius 1889 with a threshold temperature eq 3 3 k t k t 0 exp e a t r 1 t 1 t 0 where k t 0 is the temperature independent pre exponential factor e a t is the activation energy r is the universal gas constant and t 0 is the threshold temperature as peleg et al 2012 demonstrated the threshold temperature can be suppressed which involves a different value of k t 0 for the same value of kt however the present model kept the t 0 as a conceptual threshold to account for the temperature above which the thermal effect is observed the kinetic parameters of the model k t 0 and e a t r have been calculated by minimizing the normalized root mean square error nrmse between the predicted and observed concentration of viable c parvum oocysts using a constrained nonlinear multivariable optimization algorithm employing the add in solver of excel 2016 software microsoft corp redmond washington usa 2 3 2 uv irradiance effect the presence of a shoulder in the experimental photoinactivation curves suggests the application of a series event kinetic model severin et al 1983 to reproduce the experimental data this model assumes that an event is a unit of damage and n units of damage must be accumulated to inactivate the microorganisms therefore the inactivation process takes place through a sequence of inactivation levels n in the population balance of microorganisms at level i 1 i n the damaged organisms from the previous level are considered as a source positive term and the damaged organisms at the current level are considered as a sink negative term this balance is represented by eq 4 4 d c i d t k r a d i c i 1 k r a d i c i where ci is the concentration of viable c parvum oocysts oocysts ml 1 at level i at a specific time t c i 1 is the concentration of viable c parvum oocysts oocysts ml 1 at the previous level krad is the photoinactivation constant and i is the uv irradiance w m 2 the values of n and krad were calculated minimizing the normalized root mean square logarithmic error nrmsle between experimental and predicted concentrations of viable c parvum oocysts over time in experiments without thermal effect 30 c of water temperature using a constrained nonlinear multivariable optimization algorithm employing the add in solver of excel 2016 software microsoft corp 2 3 3 uv radiation temperature synergistic effect to account for this synergistic effect in the model krad from eq 4 was redefined with the arrhenius equation eq 5 5 k r a d k r a d 0 exp e a r a d r 1 t 1 t 0 where k r a d 0 is the temperature independent pre exponential factor and e a r a d is the activation energy the kinetic parameters of the model k r a d 0 e a r a d r n k t 0 and e a t r were recalculated minimizing the nrmsle between the predicted and observed values of the kinetic constants using the sequential quadratic programming sqp nonlinear optimization tool implemented in gnu octave platform www octave org the values of the kinetic parameters previously calculated in the previous submodels were used as seeds for the optimization 2 3 4 wavelength dependent spectral action finally to describe c parvum sensitivity to solar inactivation as a function of wavelength a quantum yield ϕ cp was defined as the ratio between the number of damaged oocysts and the number of absorbed photons to determine the rate of photon absorption the absorption spectrum for a single oocyst was defined like mattle et al 2015 previously did for adenovirus ms2 and phix174 viruses as busse et al 2019 demonstrated absorption of solar light by c parvum is dominated by the nucleic acid components since the action spectrum is similar in shape to the dna absorption spectrum with a maximum around 260 nm the absorbance at 260 nm can be calculated by multiplying the weight of dsdna in c parvum by the weight normalized extinction coefficient of the dsdna at 260 nm ɛ cp 260nm reported as 0 020 ml µg 1 cm 1 gallagher 2011 the weight of the dna of c parvum was calculated following data deposited in national center for biotechnology information ncbi reference cm000429 1 national center for biotechnology information 2020 and corresponds to 9 51 10 10 µg the absorption spectrum for c parvum was determined by considering the shape of the absorption spectrum of a c parvum oocyst suspension measured by busse et al 2019 and kindly provided by the authors upon request a 5 point smoothing was applied to the spectrum data in the range from 240 to 400 nm and the values were normalized to the absorption at 260 nm the final results of the spectral extinction coefficients of a single c parvum oocyst ɛcp λ ml oocyst 1cm 1 are shown in table s2 as a result the photoinactivation kinetic parameter can be expressed according to eq 6 6 k r a d 0 i ϕ cp λ ε cp λ i λ λ h c d λ where λ h c photon j 1 converts the energy units of the spectral irradiance i λ to the photonic units where h is the planck s constant and c is the speed of light in vacuum the value of the quantum yield ϕ cp can be calculated by resolution of eq 6 3 results and discussion 3 1 dark thermal inactivation data from experiments in dark conditions were evaluated at water temperatures commonly achieved during solar exposure of water 30 40 42 43 44 and 45 c experimental results shown in fig s1 confirm a noticeable effect of temperature the experiment at 30 c being the only case in which inactivation did not happen for this reason the threshold temperature of the arrhenius equation t 0 in eq 3 was set to 30 c 303 k the experimental results two replicates in all cases were fitted to a first order kinetic model eq 1 and the values of the kinetic constant were used to calculate the provisional values of the thermal kinetic parameters k t 0 1 12 10 4 h 1 and e a t r 4 37 105 k nrmse 8 59 these parameters will be refined later with the complete set of experimental data using these provisional values as seeds predicted results of the thermal inactivation are also shown in fig s1 some reports found no effects on c parvum survival for water temperatures up to 40 c liu et al 2015 however other publications suggested that the viability of c parvum decreases progressively for temperatures in the range from 30 to 50 c due to the melting point of the fatty acids and hydrocarbons present in the oocyst wall and the increase in the metabolic activity fayer and nerad 1996 jenkins et al 2010 king et al 2005 peng et al 2008 furthermore temperatures above 37 c can induce the phenomenon of spontaneous excystation of c parvum oocysts making their survival impossible in the absence of a host gómez couso et al 2009 smith et al 2005 however these phenomena do not necessarily follow a pure arrhenius behavior what can explain the small deviations observed in experiments at 40 and 42 c 3 2 uv irradiance effect data from c parvum inactivation experiments under illumination uv irradiance of 30 40 and 50 w m 2 at a temperature of 30 c to neglect thermal effects were fitted to a series event model eq 4 calculation of the kinetic parameters n 8 and krad 4 05 10 2 m2 w 1 h 1 was carried out by fitting the experimental data with an nrmsle of 2 44 see fig s2 1 the direct coupling of the dark thermal inactivation model with the uv irradiance model failed to predict the inactivation of c parvum at temperatures higher than 30 c figs s2 2 and s2 3 with a global value of nrmsle 17 9 the predictions clearly underestimate the experimental data showing a higher error for higher temperatures which supports the existence of a synergy between the thermal and photonic inactivation processes the existence of a strong synergistic effect between the optical and thermal processes to inactivate microorganisms is well known mcguigan et al 1998 wegelin et al 1994 and has been modeled for bacteria and viruses castro alférez et al 2017 garcía gil et al 2020b 3 3 uv radiation temperature synergistic effect the synergistic effect was included in the model through the temperature dependence of the kinetic constant of the series event model according to the modified arrhenius equation using again a value of 30 c 303 k for the temperature threshold t 0 all the kinetic parameters were recalculated using as seeds the provisional values in the previous submodels the global fitting of the whole experimental data set for the complete range of irradiances and temperatures provides the values of the final kinetic parameters n 7 k rad0 2 97 10 2 m2 w 1 h 1 e a r a d r 6 90 104 k k t 0 4 19 10 5 h 1 and e a t r 5 06 105 k with an nrmsle of 3 68 figs 1 1 1 2 1 3 and 1 4 in this case whereas the predictions of the dark thermal inactivation and the photoinactivation at 30 c are very similar the prediction of the photoinactivation at higher temperatures improves significantly 3 4 wavelength dependent spectral action the developed model which considers the synergistic effect between the uv irradiance and temperature and the independent thermal effect succeeds in reproducing the c parvum inactivation using a light source with the solar spectrum however for the same global uv irradiance if the spectral distribution of the radiation changes the effective damage can also dramatically change the wavelength dependent spectral contribution needs to be modeled to predict the inactivation in solar disinfection containers with different transmission spectra as suggested by mattle et al 2015 the inactivation rate can be calculated by multiplying the quantum yield the concentration of microorganisms and the volumetric rate of photon absorption calculated as the integration in wavelength of the spectral microorganism extinction coefficient by the spectral irradiance for each wavelength table s2 shows the c parvum extinction coefficients ɛcp λ calculated in this work and the spectral irradiance i λ from 280 to 400 nm for a global uv i of 50 w m 2 following eq 6 the quantum yield for c parvum inactivation with the solar simulator spectrum was calculated as ϕ cp 3 94 10 7 oocysts damaged per absorbed photon indicating that c parvum is more resistant to direct inactivation than viruses such as phix174 ms2 and adenovirus 1 4 10 2 2 9 10 3 and 2 5 10 4 virus inactivated per absorbed photon respectively mattle et al 2015 in any case it is important to notice the critical role of the calibration of the spectroradiometer used to measure the emission of the incident radiation especially in the uvb range for instance in the case of the ms2 virus different values of the quantum yield can be found in the literature 2 07 10 3 2 9 10 3 and 2 56 10 4 viruses inactivated per absorbed photon for garcía gil et al 2020b mattle et al 2015 and silverman et al 2019 respectively the reason for these apparent discrepancies is the high sensibility of the results to the experimental data provided by the spectroradiometer basically each quantum yield value worked well in the framework of the spectral measurements from which it was derived in this sense the use of quantum yields reported in the literature should be carefully selected and the calculation for each specific device is always recommended 3 5 validation of the model the developed model is able to predict the inactivation of c parvum oocysts depending on the water temperature irradiance and spectral distribution of the incident light allowing the estimation of the required inactivation times for different locations around the world additionally the model has also a particular strength the capability of estimating required solar exposure time when solar water disinfection is performed in containers made of any material with a known transmission spectrum to validate this strength experiments were carried out using plastic materials of different uv b transmittance pet pp and pmma and combining two levels of global uv irradiance 30 and 50 w m 2 and water temperature 30 and 44 c in three experiments the experiment with the lowest values of both variables was neglected figs 2 1 2 2 and 2 3 show the comparison between the observed and the predicted inactivation profiles of c parvum oocysts versus the exposure time for the pet pp and pmma scenarios considering the fully predictive nature of the model inactivation curves they are not fitting results the agreement can be considered very good with values of nrmsle of 5 54 5 72 and 11 68 for pet pp and pmma respectively the results can be easily interpreted based on the different uv transmission of the materials 1 44 and 57 in the global uv b range and 59 60 and 86 in the uv a range for pet pp and pmma respectively the radiation transmitted and the c parvum extinction coefficients versus wavelength are shown in fig 3 data in table s2 as can be observed the uv b is the critical region in which the c parvum absorption mainly overlaps with the spectrum of the incident radiation and therefore the uv b transmission will be very significant in the c parvum photoinactivation however as shown fig 3 the emission of the solar simulator overestimates the irradiance of the standard am 1 5 solar spectrum especially in the 280 300 nm range where the process is very sensitive consequently under real sunlight pp and pmma would be expected to perform slightly worse for the pp and pmma scenarios the photoinactivation is possible being higher for the plastic with the higher transmission pmma the thermal effect and the irradiance effect can be observed in both cases for experiments at the same global uv irradiance and the same water temperature respectively in the case of pet plastic that essentially does not transmit uv b radiation the thermal contribution is almost the only damage source in pure water achieving at simple sight the same disinfection rate for different values of global uv irradiance model predictions for 30 and 50 w m 2 at 44 c seem to be the same the type of photodamage can be direct or indirect nelson et al 2018 direct damage is due to the absorption of radiation by genome dna in this case and is mainly initiated by photons in the uv b range the indirect damage is caused when an external or internal photosensitizer that can absorb uv b radiation as well as uv a and visible radiation produces photo produced reactive intermediates ppri that damage the microorganisms i e reactive oxidative species ros nelson et al 2018 the absence of external sensitizers experiments carried out in distillate water and the negligible inactivation with only uv a and visible radiation at low temperature pet scenario at 30 c leads to think that c parvum cannot be damage by endogenous indirect damage produced by internal photosensitizers however king et al 2010 were unable to readily detect cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers formation or dna damage in oocysts exhibiting similar or greater levels of inactivation by solar uv but they proved that solar uv radiation induces sporozoite membrane depolarization resulting in reduced cellular atp and increased cytosolic calcium accompanied by a reduction in the internal granularity of sporozoites indicative of apical organelle discharge and sporozoite exocytosis resulting in a significant reduction in the ability of sporozoites to attach and invade host cells other authors confirm that the presence of natural organic matter nom one of the known photosensitizers did not improve the inactivation likely due to the resistance of the thick oocyst wall to exogenous inactivation liu et al 2015 furthermore in the case of using high volume containers the damage produced by the external ppri can be completely overshadowed by the role of the sensitizers as attenuators of radiation garcía gil et al 2020c moreover only for the temperature higher than 30 c the thermal effect is noticeable these facts confirm two things the threshold on the thermal inactivation set to 30 c and the dominant mechanism of c parvum photoinactivation by the direct damage caused by the uv b photons absorption by dna thus it also means that the solar water disinfection of c parvum in common containers of pet with pure water is practically possible because of thermal inactivation however reached temperature during solar water disinfection easily rises up to 30 c dejung et al 2007 gómez couso et al 2010 in the present study the survival of c parvum oocysts were determined by the inclusion exclusion of the fluorogenic vital dye pi an indicator of the integrity and permeability of the oocyst wall campbell et al 1992 which may be affected during sodis procedures mcguigan et al 2006 this staining method is quick simple non expensive and provides useful information in studies on the influence of environmental factors pressures as the temperature and radiation on the survival of cryptosporidium spp oocysts however this technique overestimates the oocyst infectivity in comparison with cell culture methods and bioassays in murine models adeyemo et al 2018 robertson and gjerde 2007 providing a safety margin in the water treatment by sodis which will benefit the microbiological quality of the treated water and in protecting consumer health moreover it should be considered that in those geographical regions where the who recommends the use of sodis as an alternative method of disinfection to guarantee the safety of water destined for human consumption the levels of water turbidity varied widely depending on weather conditions and time of collection the turbidity of water in some areas can vary between 5 and 2000 ntu daily joyce et al 1996 laboratory experiments have shown that in water samples of turbidity higher than 200 ntu less than 1 of the total incident ultraviolet light uv penetrates further than a depth of 2 cm from the surface joyce et al 1996 in this case the role of temperature in the inactivation of c parvum oocysts is more crucial and therefore the viability values determined by the inclusion exclusion of fluorogenic vital dyes will be very similar to the infectivity values detected using a murine model or a cell culture also in a previous study in which the combined effects of solar radiation intensity water turbidity and exposure time on the survival of c parvum oocysts during simulated sodis exposure were investigated it was showed that only in those cases in which the infectivity was not 100 the values of oocyst viability obtained by the inclusion exclusion of pi were slightly higher than the corresponding values obtained with a neonatal murine model gómez couso et al 2009 4 conclusions a novel comprehensive kinetic model for the inactivation of c parvum in clear water by solar light has been developed the model considers the solar irradiance water temperature the photonic thermal synergistic effect and the specific sensibility of c parvum to the spectral distribution of radiation a threshold temperature of 30 c is considered in the model for the dark thermal inactivation of c parvum being this process especially significant above 40 c uv radiation also leads to the inactivation being the efficacy strongly affected by the spectral distribution of the incident light as c parvum inactivation in mainly driven by photons in the uv b range the quantum yield of the photonic process has been calculated from experimental data and the spectral extinction coefficients of c parvum has been also determined these values reflect the strong sensitivity of the process to the spectral distribution of the incident light in agreement with the biological mechanism of cryptosporidium oocyst inactivation based on the direct absorption of photons by the nucleic acids the joint action of temperature and radiation leads to a strong synergistic effect that improves the efficacy of the process the incorporation of this synergistic effect in the model gives very meaningful predictions with an average fitting error of the experimental data of only 3 7 finally the predictions of this comprehensive model have been successfully validated with experimental data from three different scenarios of variable temperature and spectral transmission in the uv range predictions of solar inactivation using pet pp and pmma materials led to errors of 5 5 5 7 and 11 7 respectively therefore the developed model constitutes a powerful tool for the predictive evaluation of c parvum inactivation rate under different solar spectral irradiance and environmental temperature conditions for any location worldwide applications range from the estimation of the natural inactivation in the environment to the technical design of solar water disinfection processes for drinking water supply including the spectral transmission of the materials however because sodis procedures can be implemented in different geographical regions it is recommended to carry out experiments in order to adjust the model to local conditions

17593,in this study we investigated the degradation mechanism of erythromycin ery during uv led chlorine treatment using a 275 nm ultraviolet light emitting diode uv led this wavelength is known to generate fewer disinfection byproducts dbps and to have higher energy and photon yield efficiency compared to low pressure mercury lp uv lamp which emits 254 nm of uv radiation the degradation of ery during the uv led chlorine reaction followed pseudo first order kinetics while cl and clo radicals along with other secondary radicals played key roles in the degradation of ery at alkaline ph conditions oh radical was the main contributor at acidic ph conditions using ultra high performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry uplc qtof ms we tentatively identified six byproducts trace amounts of dbps such as chloroform chcl3 and chlorate clo3 ions were also detected at less than 0 3 mg l there was no residual antibiotic effect at the end of the uv led chlorine reaction due to the complete degradation of important moieties such as macrolide in ery toxicity decreased by 20 after 20 min during the uv led chlorine process of ery 1 0 mg l

environments which poses a threat to human health worldwide shao et al 2018 global warming may also accelerate the overuse of antibiotics kim et al 2010 sarter et al 2019 in tropical areas global warming promotes a wider range of infectious diseases and novel bacterial infections may also occur pandey et al 2014 this may lead to an increase in antibiotic use erythromycin ery has been one of the most widely used antibiotics for various infections since the 1950s fohner et al 2017 owing to its abundance and toxicity ery is included on the contaminant candidate list 4 ccl 4 of the us environmental protection agency epa us epa 2016 conventional wastewater treatment processes are relatively inefficient in removing antibiotics resulting in their accumulation in the receiving water environment bonvin et al 2016 recent studies reported that municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps and hospital wwtps were hotspots of antibiotic disposal michael et al 2013 furthermore biological treatment facilities in conventional wwtps promote antibiotic resistant horizontal gene transfer among bacteria rizzo et al 2013 to solve these problems advanced oxidation processes aops have recently

reclaimed water wang et al 2020 the uv chlorine process can enhance micropollutant control in a water environment fang et al 2014 when chlorine is exposed to uv light free chlorine can generate various radicals e g oh radicals oh and oxygen ion radical o as well as reactive chlorine species rcs e g chlorine atom radical cl dichloride radicals cl2 and hypochlorous acid radical cloh the hydrated electron eaq also can be produced via photoemission of water after excitation during uv radiation at 274 266 260 or 213 nm shreve et al 2010 tang et al 2010 while oh is a non selective oxidative radical nowell and hoigné 1992 watts and linden 2007 other radicals such as cl clo cloh and o are relatively selective grebel et al 2010 since these radicals can induce synergistic micropollutant removal the uv chlorine process has attracted significant interest although disinfection byproducts dbps such as chloroform chcl3 and chlorate clo3 may form during the process fang et al 2017 von gunten 2018 the conventional uv chlorine process usually employs low pressure mercury lamps lp uv which have several disadvantages including ph control under acidic conditions and relatively high energy requirement as an alternative uv source a light emitting diode led especially 275 nm led can be used in place of an lp mercury lamp gao et al 2019 yin et al 2018 recent studies have investigated the degradation of certain micropollutants and byproducts of the lp uv chlorine and uv led chlorine processes cai et al 2019 xiang et al 2016 however no studies have examined ery degradation kinetics and mechanism along with the inactivation of arb and arg together during the uv led chlorine process driven by a 275 nm uv led in this study we compared ery degradation during chlorination uv led photolysis the uv led chlorine process we examined ery degradation kinetics at various phs and chlorine dosages and the relative contributions of radicals such as oh and reactive chlorine species rcs using radical scavengers at different phs moreover we identified transformation products tps and dbps during ery degradation during chlorination and the uv led chlorine process based on the identified byproducts we proposed a degradation pathway of ery under the uv led chlorine process finally we evaluated residual antibiotic effects toxicity and inactivation of arb and arg

and covered them with quartz vials working current 110 4 ma as a cooling system a diagram of the uv led reactor is shown in fig s1 in the supplementary materials the photon flux of the uv led lamp was measured using a potassium iodide iodate actinometer bolton et al 2001 and the measured photon flux per hour of the system was 996 μe l 2 3 experimental procedure the kinetic experiments investigating ery degradation during dark chlorination uv led photolysis and uv led chlorine reactions were conducted in a uv led reactor when the led was turned on during a dark chlorination reaction the effects of chlorine dosage 5 20 mg l of chlorine and ph 6 9 were examined during the uv led chlorine reaction the ph of the reaction solution was maintained during the reactions with 5 mm phosphate buffer solution the reaction solution was promptly subjected to 275 nm uv led radiation after spiking with chlorine and ery the ambient air temperature was kept constant at 20 0 2 0 c during the experiments during a 60 min reaction we sampled 5 ml of synthetic wastewater at several time points residual chlorine was quickly quenched with 0 1 m na2s2o3 solution 2 4 analytical methods we analyzed ery using

scientific 2 5 toxicity tests we estimated the acute toxicity of ery and its byproducts using the oecd toolbox v 4 2 http www qsartoolbox org this approach is recommended given the relatively high accuracy that can be achieved with respect to the quantitative structure activity relationship qsar ghanem et al 2017 it also avoids the ethical issues associated with animal testing in addition microtox tests were employed to determine time dependent acute toxicity trends during the uv led chlorine reaction using the luminescent bacteria alivibrio fischeri a fishceri gutierrez et al 2002 this method is widely used to measure acute toxicity a fischeri was exposed to the treated solution for 15 min and we then measured its luminescence intensity l t the luminescence intensity of the

state radical concentrations at each ph were determined using kintecus v 6 4 text s1 for calculating the contribution of oh during the uv led chlorine reaction we used nb as a radical probe since nb only reacts with oh while it does not react with other radicals fang et al 2014 the contribution of each reactive chlorine species rcs e g cl cl2 and clo was evaluated using competition kinetics with nb ba sbc and dmob respectively we spiked each radical scavenger or combination of radical scavengers into the synthetic wastewater to evaluate the relative contribution of radicals details of the radical scavenging experiments are provided in section 3 3 2 7 antibiotic resistant bacteria inactivation and antibiotic sensitivity test ery resistant escherichia coli e coli were isolated from hospital wastewater effluent ewha women s university medical center seoul south korea the number of beds 800 the isolation procedure for e coli is provided in text s2 to examine the inactivation ability of e coli during the uv led chlorine reaction 2 ml of e coli culture media was spiked into 498 ml of synthetic wastewater containing ery all conditions and procedures were the same as in the ery degradation kinetics experiment the inactivation rate was determined by the plate count technique with decimal serial dilution we counted the number of colonies in the diluted plates and then multiplied the value by the dilution ratio to determine the inactivation rate we further evaluated arg inactivation by counting the number of arg replications using a quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr method as described in a previous study yoon et al 2017 then we carried out a regression analysis to evaluate the gene inactivation rate zhang et al 2019 for antibiotic susceptibility testing we used a plasmid free geobacilluis stearothermophilus g stearothermophilus and bromothymol blue btb ph indicator biomed seoul south korea we cultured g stearothermophilus using lysogeny broth lb fluidic media with btb solution at 65 c for 2 5 h if g stearothermophilus is exposed to an antibiotic agent acidic metabolism does not occur and the color of the culture fluid remains blue microbial metabolism occurs if there is no residual antibiotic effect and the color of the culture fluid turns yellow wu et al 2019 3 results and discussion 3 1 degradation kinetics we first compared the ery removal during chlorination uv photolysis and uv led chlorine reaction fig 1 shows that the uv led chlorine reaction resulted in the highest degree of ery degradation followed by chlorination and uv photolysis reactions while chlorination achieved 62 removal over a period of 60 min 98 of ery degradation occurred during the uv led chlorine reaction over the same period fig 1 in contrast no degradation of ery was observed during uv led photolysis due to the lack of uv chromophores in ery deubel et al 2006 the chlorination and uv led chlorine reaction followed pseudo first order pfo kinetics r2 0 98 table s4 the observed rate constant k obs of the uv led chlorine reaction 8 7 10 2 min 1 was 3 6 times faster than that of the chlorination reaction 2 4 10 2 min 1 demonstrating the synergetic effect of uv led and chlorine this result may have been due to the production of selective or non selective oxidative radicals for example oh and rcs e g cl cl2 and clo can be produced during the uv led chlorine reaction as shown in eqs 1 6 fang et al 2014 guo et al 2017 jennings et al 2001 kläning and wolff 1985 matthew and anastasio 2006 zehavi and rabani 1972 these radicals can increase the degradation rate of ery in the uv led chlorine reaction 1 hocl o c l h v oh o cl 2 cl c l k 1 k 2 c l 2 k 1 6 5 10 9 m 1 s 1 k 2 1 1 10 5 s 1 3 oh hocl clo h 2 o k 2 0 10 9 m 1 s 1 4 oh o

k obs values in both the chlorination and uv led chlorine reactions as the chlorine concentration increased from 5 to 20 mg l the k obs values in the chlorination reaction linearly increased r2 0 98 however the k obs values for the uv led chlorine reaction linearly increased only from 5 to 15 mg l after 15 mg l the rate was saturated until 20 mg l implying that the excessive chlorine has a negative effect on ery removal the decrease in k obs at higher chlorine concentration may be due to that excessive amounts of chlorine can act as a scavenger of oh and cl radicals eq 3 to 6 fang et al 2014 guo et al 2017 previous studies reported a similar trend when using excessive chlorine during the lp uv chlorine process huang et al 2017 kong et al 2016 xiang et al 2016 the ph of the solution also affected the removal of ery during the chlorination and uv led chlorine reactions fig 2 b the highest k obs values were obtained at ph 8 in the chlorination reaction followed by ph 9 7 and 6 even though the neutral form of free chlorine hocl is considered as a stronger oxidant li and zhang 2012 cationic ery can more effectively react with ocl ion rather than hocl due to the electrostatic interaction pka of ery 8 9 however at ph 9 the neutral form of ery is dominant 55 while the protonated form of ery prevails at ph 7 and 8 98 55 goldman et al 1990 the neutral form of ery can react with free chlorine slower than the cationic form li and zhang 2012 causing k obs to be diminished at ph 9 during chlorination reactions during the uv led chlorine process the trend of k obs with ph was the same as that of chlorination reaction k obs value was highest at ph 8 followed by ph 9 ph 7 ph 6 this result can be explained in two ways first chlorination may have the same effect on k obs as uv led chlorine reaction secondly even though the quantum yield of ocl ion 0 8 mol e 1 is 2 5 times lower than that of hocl 2 0 mol e 1 at 275 nm uv kwon et al 2018 it is reported that the radical scavenging effect of ocl ion is 2 7 4 4 times higher than that of hocl eq 3 6 fang et al 2014 guo et al 2017 moreover the molar absorbance coefficient ε of ocl ion 245 m 1 cm 1 is 8 8 times higher than that of hocl 28 m 1 cm 1 kwon et al 2018 therefore the production of radicals from free chlorine during the uv led chlorine process can be significantly promoted at alkaline ph conditions however table s5 showed that the free chlorine consumption rate showed the highest at ph 8 followed by ph 9 7 and 6 it suggests that the radicals produced by chlorine consumption are most produced at ph 8 for this reason the k obs values might be decreased by 8 at ph 9 2 4 10 2 min 1 compared to ph 8 2 6 10 2 min 1 due to the higher fraction of ocl ion at ph 9 compared to ph 8 fig 3 3 3 contribution of radical species we investigated the contribution of each radical species during the uv led chlorine reaction of ery by investigating the degradation kinetics in the presence of various radical scavengers during the uv chlorine reaction various radicals can be produced including oh cl clo and other secondary radicals such as cl2 cloh o and the hydrated electron eaq however due to their relatively low oxidation potential and high selectivity of cl2 cloh and o the contributions of these species during the uv led chlorine reaction were overlooked hasegawa and neta 1978 grebel et al 2010 armstrong et al 2015 since these radicals also can contribute to the degradation of pollutants we further investigated the effect of overlooked radicals in this study the relative contribution of ery degradation kinetics k obs during uv led chlorine process can be expressed as eq 7 7 k o b s k c l 2 e r y c l 2 k oh ery o h s s k cl ery c l s s k clo ery c l o s s k others ery o t h e r s s s where k cl2 ery is a second order rate constant for ery degradation during chlorination k oh ery is a second order reaction rate constant of ery with oh m 1 s 1 oh ss is a steady state concentration of oh m k cl ery is a second order reaction rate constant of ery with cl m 1s 1 and cl ss is a steady state concentration of cl m k clo ery is a second order reaction rate constant of ery with clo m 1s 1 and clo ss is a steady state concentration of clo m k others ery is a second order reaction rate constant of ery with other secondary radicals m 1s 1 such as cl2 cloh o and eaq others ss is a steady state concentration of other secondary radicals cl2 cloh o and eaq m respectively the contribution of each radical species at each ph in eq 7 were evaluated using various radical scavengers first we determined the contribution of oh during the uv led chlorine reaction of ery in the presence of 13 μm of nb nb is known to react only with oh with a rate constant k oh nb of 3 9 109 m 1 s 1 while it does not react with other radicals fang et al 2014 oh ss can be determined using eq 8 table s8 and the k obs value k oh ery of ery with oh has been reported previously 3 8 109 m 1s 1 wols et al 2013 hence the contribution of oh k ery oh to ery degradation during the uv led reaction at different ph values can be calculated using eq 9 as 2 5 10 2 1 4 10 2 1 2 10 2 and 5 2 10 3 min 1 at ph 6 7 8 and 9 respectively 8 k nb k oh nb oh ss 9 k e r y o h k oh ery oh ss the relative contribution of cl during ery degradation can be directly determined by using a mixed system of nb 13 μm ba 13 μm and dmob 10 mm altogether while nb can only react with oh ba reacts with both cl and oh with the rate constants of 1 8 1010 m 1 s 1 and 5 9 109 m 1 s 1 respectively buxton et al 1988 also dmob was injected to eliminate the effect of clo because dmob can only react with clo with the rate constant of 2 1 109 m 1 s 1 alfassi et al 1988 then the steady state concentration of cl cl ss can be determined using eq 10 15 wang et al 2016 10 ln n b t n b 0 k o h n b o h s s 11 ln b a t b a 0 k o h b a o h s s k c l b a c l s s 12 o h s s s l o p e 1 k oh nb 13 c l s s s l o p e 2 k oh ba o h s s k cl ba 14 k e r y c l k cl ery c l s s where k cl ba and k oh ba is the second order rate constant of each radical with ba cl ss is the steady state concentration of cl slope 1 and slope 2 are the linearly fitted slopes of eq 10 and eq 11 respectively the observed steady state concentrations of cl at different phs can be determined by using eqs 12 and 13 table s8 the second order kinetic constant of ery with cl is known as 7 109 m 1s 1 lei et al 2019 so that the contribution of cl to ery degradation k ery cl at each ph can be directly determined by using eq 14 as 1 8 10 2 1 4 10 2 1 1 10 2 and 6 7 10 3 min 1 at ph 6 7 8 and 9 respectively the result showed that the contribution of cl kept increasing as the ph increased next the contribution of clo during the uv led chlorine reaction of ery can be determined by using the competitive kinetics in the presence of dmob and sbc scavengers to eliminate the effect of other radicals such as oh cl and cl2 we added an excessive amount of sbc while dmob only reacts with clo sbc reacts with oh cl and cl2 with the rate constants of 8 5 106 m 1 s 1 2 2 108 m 1 s 1 and 8 0 107 m 1 s 1 respectively fang et al 2014 the second order rate constants of ery 13 6 μm with clo in the presence of dmob 13 μm and sbc 100 mm can be obtained using eq 15 17 15 ln e r y 0 e r y t k c l o e r y k c l o d m o b ln d m o b 0 d m o b t 16 ln d m o b 0 d m o b t k clo dmob clo s s 17 k e r y c l o k c l o e r y c l o s s where k clo ery and k clo dmob is the second order rate constant of clo with the ery and dmob respectively the competitive kinetics results were shown in fig s2 r2 0 96 since k clo dmob value is reported from the previous study as 2 1 109 m 1 s 1 alfassi et al 1988 k clo ery value can be determined using eq 15 as 3 1 109 m 1 s 1 3 3 109 m 1 s 1 7 5 109 m 1 s 1 and 1 0 1010 m 1 s 1 at ph 6 7 8 and 9 respectively next the steady state concentrations of clo can be calculated using eq 16 table s8 showed that the production of clo ss was two orders higher than other radicals such as oh and cl finally the contribution of clo to ery degradation k ery clo was determined by eq 17 as 4 2 10 3 8 2 10 3 4 3 10 2 and 4 7 10 2 min 1 at ph 6 7 8 and 9 respectively table s9 moreover the contribution of cl2 radical during the uv led chlorine reaction was obtained by comparing the rate constant in the presence of an excessive amount of sbc 100 mm and dmob 10 mm the rate constant in the presence of ba 10 mm and dmob 10 mm it is reported that sbc can react with oh cl and cl2 with the rate constants of 8 5 106 m 1 s 1 2 2 108 m 1 s 1 and 8 0 107 m 1 s 1 respectively and dmob can react with clo with the rate constant of 2 1 109 m 1 s 1 in contrast ba can react with cl and oh with the rate constant of 1 8 1010 m 1 s 1 and 5 9 109 m 1 s 1 respectively this fact implies that while the system containing sbc and dmob together can scavenge oh cl clo and cl2 the system containing ba and dmob only scavenges oh cl and clo respectively the difference between the two systems can give us the cl2 radical during the uv led chlorine reaction however our result showed that no significant difference in k obs values between the two systems were obtained t test p 0 05 this result can be from that k cl2 ery 5 106 m 1s 1 is significantly lower than other radicals lei et al 2019 therefore we assumed that the effect of cl2 during the uv led chlorine reaction can be neglected finally to calculate the contribution of other secondary radicals kothers such as eaq o and cloh we subtracted the obtained contributions of chlorination reaction oh cl and clo respectively from the k obs values of ery degradation during the uv led chlorine reaction as shown in eq 18 18 k others ery o t h e r s s s k o b s k c l 2 e r y c l 2 k oh ery o h s s k cl ery c l s s k clo ery c l o s s among secondary radicals not only hydrated electron eaq but also other secondary radicals such as cloh and o can contribute during the uv led chlorine reaction however it is hard to calculate the contribution of each secondary radical directly due to a lack of scavengers especially we cannot obtain the contribution of the hydrated electron eaq because the scavengers for eaq such as chloroform h2o2 nitrous oxide and thymine can be interrupted by other factors such as uv free chlorine oh cl and clo respectively during the uv led chlorine reaction hart and fielden 1965 wu et al 2020 instead we can confirm that the effect of eaq among secondary radicals can be significantly decreased as ph decreases to acidic conditions because eaq can rapidly react with a proton h with a fast rate constant of 2 4 1010 m 1s 1 gordon et al 1963 also fig 3 showed that the effect of cloh and o can be minimal since the contribution of other secondary radicals was negligible at ph 6 these results imply that among secondary radicals if the contribution of cloh and o are still negligible in most ph ranges the contribution of eaq can be significantly increased as the ph increased to alkaline conditions as shown in fig 3 however further studies are still needed to identify the contribution of each secondary radical directly fig 3 summarized the relative radical contribution during the uv led chlorine process at various ph conditions based on radical contribution experiments the production of most radicals was the highest at ph 8 followed by 9 7 and 6 except for the oh also both oh and cl were significantly contributed at lower ph values while clo and other radicals such as eaq cloh and o increased their portions among the radicals as the ph increased to alkaline phs during the uv chlorine reaction of ery we further estimated the relative radical production using kintecus software ianni 2017 with chemical equations table s6 and the result is shown in table s7 the concentration of oh and cl was the highest at ph 6 and decreased until ph 9 while cl2 and clo concentrations were highest at ph 8 followed by ph 9 7 and 6 unfortunately the concentration of other secondary radicals was not calculated due to the lack of related chemical reactions the production pattern of the radicals was similar to the result of experimentally obtained relative radical contribution in this study table s8 a previous study also reported that a similar radical formation trend during lp uv chlorine treatment increased with increasing ph guo et al 2017 except for clo in the uv led chlorine reaction the production trends of oh and cl at each ph were almost the same in the lp uv chlorine system however the concentration of clo was the highest at ph 8 followed by ph 9 7 and 6 while there was no change of clo concentration at each ph condition in the lp uv chlorine system 3 4 identified byproducts six tentative byproducts were identified during the uv led chlorine process m z 750 4633 736 4491 720 4512 716 4565 702 4413 325 4926 respectively three of which were also identified during the chlorination only reaction m z 750 4633 736 4491 720 4512 mass errors of tentatively identified products were less than 5 ppm table s10 fig s3 shows the time profile of the detected byproducts according to this profile we proposed a possible degradation pathway of ery during the uv led chlorine and chlorination reactions fig 4 ery is made up of a 14 member large lactone ring macrolide with two sugars desosamine and cladinose itoh and inoue 2019 the major structural alteration occurred at the macrolide and cladinose moieties during the uv led chlorine reaction fig 4 byproduct 1 m z 750 4633 can be produced as a result of hydroxylation oh due to the formation of oh adduct and demethylation at the c 1 position of the macrolide group in ery since h abstraction and electron transfer can occur by rcs such as cl and clo byproduct 2 m z 736 4491 can be derived from further dehydrogenation 2h of ery the formation of byproduct 2 can be derived from the h abstraction reaction by cl and clo byproduct 3 m z 720 4512 was generated due to the attack by oh and cl clo followed by the loss of the methoxy group och3 at the cladinose since these electrophilic radicals prefer to react with electron rich moiety wu et al 2017 next byproduct 4 m z 716 4565 corresponds to the dehydration h2o of the macrolide moiety also byproduct 5 m z 702 4413 can be formed via the dehydrogenation 2h of cladinose and subsequent dehydroxylation oh of ery at the c 11 position the h abstraction is the evidence of the rcs attack minakata et al 2017 rcs played a key role of ery degradation as a previous study reported guo et al 2017 finally further radical attacks induce multiple structural modifications of macrolide and the loss of cladinose and desosamine leading to the formation of byproduct 6 m z 325 4926 except for byproduct 2 m z 736 4491 the tps mentioned above were also detected during the uv persulfate michael kordatou et al 2015 persulfate activated iron powder h2o 2 li et al 2017 uv c photolysis reactions

led chlorine reaction through antibiotic sensitization experiment using a novel microbiological method in microtiter plates for screening ery wu et al 2019 we used g stearothermophilus with a btb ph indicator if exposed to the antibiotic agent acidic metabolism does not occur and the color of the culture fluid remains blue conversely microbial metabolism occurs if there is no residual antibiotic effect and the culture fluid turns yellow wu et al 2019 the detection limit of this method was 50 μg l fig s5 fig 5 shows that even though only 14 8 of the toc was removed during 60 min of the uv led chlorine reaction fig 1 there was no residual antimicrobial activity of treated water this may have been due to the breakdown of an essential moiety in ery such as the macrolide group fig 4 as shown in fig 5 a there was no bacteria growth inhibition when we cultured bacteria in the tube with the treated sample it turned yellow in color after the uv led chlorine treatment fig 5 b while the untreated sample maintained its blue color due to metabolic inhibition by ery we further evaluated the inactivation rates of arb and arg during the uv led chlorine reaction of ery we achieved the best inactivation efficiency when using the uv led chlorine reaction followed by uv led irradiation and chlorination fig s6 radical production might induce synergistic inactivation as well as ery removal during the uv led chlorine reaction a recent study reported a similar result through rcs production in the lp uv chlorine reaction zhang et al 2019 unfortunately we did not obtain k obs values during arb inactivation due to its rapid removal fig s6 a however we could calculate the arg inactivation rate during uv led irradiation 7 8 10 3 min 1 and uv led chlorine treatment 8 7 10 3 min 1 fig s6 b the existence of antibiotics in the wastewater samples might inhibit arg inactivation 6 7 10 3 min 1 due to uv absorption and radical scavenging effects during the uv led chlorine process 6 log removal of arb was achieved within 5 min while we achieved only 16 1 arg removal within 20 min suggesting that further treatments are required to completely inactivate residual arg 3 6 acute toxicity evaluation there are some debates regarding whether the uv chlorine reaction is safe dong et al 2017 gao et al 2017 guo et al 2016 these arguments focus on the formation of known and unknown dbps during the lp uv chlorine process von gunten 2018 for this reason we examined the acute toxicity of the reaction solutions using a fischeri a fishceri is a luminescent marine bacteria sensitive to various chemicals that loses its luminescence when exposed to toxic chemicals it has been reported that ery does not have acute toxicity to a fischeri and it can exhibit hormesis at low concentrations of ery abbas et al 2018 in the current study there was no luminescence inhibition at the initial time point fig 6 however acute toxicity increased with increasing reaction time suggesting that some byproducts produced during the uv led chlorine and chlorination reactions are more toxic than ery as previously mentioned in contrast when the initial concentration of ery 1 0 mg l and free chlorine 1 5 mg l was 10 fold lower luminescence was still present fig 6 this result indicates that even byproducts were produced they did not induce toxicity at low concentrations we also estimated the potential toxicity of tentatively identified byproducts using the oecd toolbox v 4 2 qsar based on the structural toxicity induction database we ruled out toxicity for major dbps produced during uv chlorine reactions such as chcl3 and clo3 sun et al 2016 this is because the lc50 values for a fischeri chcl3 632 mg l clo3 34 510 mg l jennings et al 2001 vanwijk and hutchinson 1995 are known to be at least 2100 fold greater than those during the uv led chlorine process in the present study chcl3 0 3 mg l clo3 0 15 mg l fig s7 according to the eco toxicity estimation performed using oecd toolbox byproducts 4 and 5 have higher toxicity than ery whereas byproducts 1 2 3 and 6 have lower toxicity fig s8 this suggests that the toxicity increase during ery degradation under the uv led chlorine reaction may result from the production of byproducts 4 and 5 4 conclusions this study investigated the degradation kinetics of ery during a uv chlorine process driven by a 275 nm led the degradation of ery followed by pfo kinetics we observed the highest removal of ery at ph 8 during the uv chlorine process under this condition we found out cl clo and others played important roles while oh contributed mainly at acidic ph further studies on the contribution of other radicals should be conducted we tentatively identified six dbps there was no residual antibiotic effect after the uv led chlorine process and we did not observe an alarming level of dbp formation two byproducts byproducts 4 and 5 were more toxic than ery but under relatively realistic conditions they did not have an acute toxic effect in addition we confirmed the inactivation of arb and arg during the uv led chlorine process compared to lp uv uv led still has limitations such as low transmittance due to its lower output however uv led has high energy efficiency and a longer lifetime than a mercury lamp the results of our study imply that the uv led chlorine process can be applied to decentralized small scale

17593,in this study we investigated the degradation mechanism of erythromycin ery during uv led chlorine treatment using a 275 nm ultraviolet light emitting diode uv led this wavelength is known to generate fewer disinfection byproducts dbps and to have higher energy and photon yield efficiency compared to low pressure mercury lp uv lamp which emits 254 nm of uv radiation the degradation of ery during the uv led chlorine reaction followed pseudo first order kinetics while cl and clo radicals along with other secondary radicals played key roles in the degradation of ery at alkaline ph conditions oh radical was the main contributor at acidic ph conditions using ultra high performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry uplc qtof ms we tentatively identified six byproducts trace amounts of dbps such as chloroform chcl3 and chlorate clo3 ions were also detected at less than 0 3 mg l there was no residual antibiotic effect at the end of the uv led chlorine reaction due to the complete degradation of important moieties such as macrolide in ery toxicity decreased by 20 after 20 min during the uv led chlorine process of ery 1 0 mg l

environments which poses a threat to human health worldwide shao et al 2018 global warming may also accelerate the overuse of antibiotics kim et al 2010 sarter et al 2019 in tropical areas global warming promotes a wider range of infectious diseases and novel bacterial infections may also occur pandey et al 2014 this may lead to an increase in antibiotic use erythromycin ery has been one of the most widely used antibiotics for various infections since the 1950s fohner et al 2017 owing to its abundance and toxicity ery is included on the contaminant candidate list 4 ccl 4 of the us environmental protection agency epa us epa 2016 conventional wastewater treatment processes are relatively inefficient in removing antibiotics resulting in their accumulation in the receiving water environment bonvin et al 2016 recent studies reported that municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps and hospital wwtps were hotspots of antibiotic disposal michael et al 2013 furthermore biological treatment facilities in conventional wwtps promote antibiotic resistant horizontal gene transfer among bacteria rizzo et al 2013 to solve these problems advanced oxidation processes aops have recently been applied including ozonation liu et al 2012 electrochemical oxidation zhu et al 2016 ultraviolet uv tio2 lin and lin 2014 uv h2o2 wols et al 2013 uv s2o8 michael kordatou et al 2015 and low

reclaimed water wang et al 2020 the uv chlorine process can enhance micropollutant control in a water environment fang et al 2014 when chlorine is exposed to uv light free chlorine can generate various radicals e g oh radicals oh and oxygen ion radical o as well as reactive chlorine species rcs e g chlorine atom radical cl dichloride radicals cl2 and hypochlorous acid radical cloh the hydrated electron eaq also can be produced via photoemission of water after excitation during uv radiation at 274 266 260 or 213 nm shreve et al 2010 tang et al 2010 while oh is a non selective oxidative radical nowell and hoigné 1992 watts and linden 2007 other radicals such as cl clo cloh and o are relatively selective grebel et al 2010 since these radicals can induce synergistic micropollutant removal the uv chlorine process has attracted significant interest although disinfection byproducts dbps such as chloroform chcl3 and chlorate clo3 may form during the process fang et al 2017 von gunten 2018 the conventional uv chlorine process usually employs low pressure mercury lamps lp uv which have several disadvantages including ph control under acidic conditions and relatively high energy requirement as an alternative uv source a light emitting diode led especially 275 nm led can be used in place of an lp mercury lamp gao et al 2019 yin et al 2018 recent studies have investigated the degradation of certain micropollutants and byproducts of the lp uv chlorine and uv led chlorine processes cai et al 2019 xiang et al 2016 however no studies have examined ery degradation kinetics and mechanism along with the inactivation of arb and arg together during the uv led chlorine process driven by a 275 nm uv led in this study we compared ery degradation during chlorination uv led photolysis the uv led chlorine process we examined ery degradation kinetics at various phs and chlorine dosages and the relative contributions of radicals such as oh and reactive chlorine species rcs using radical scavengers at different phs moreover we identified transformation products tps and dbps during ery degradation during chlorination and the uv led chlorine process based on the identified byproducts we proposed a degradation pathway of ery under the uv led chlorine process finally we evaluated residual antibiotic effects toxicity and inactivation of arb and arg

and covered them with quartz vials working current 110 4 ma as a cooling system a diagram of the uv led reactor is shown in fig s1 in the supplementary materials the photon flux of the uv led lamp was measured using a potassium iodide iodate actinometer bolton et al 2001 and the measured photon flux per hour of the system was 996 μe l 2 3 experimental procedure the kinetic experiments investigating ery degradation during dark chlorination uv led photolysis and uv led chlorine reactions were conducted in a uv led reactor when the led was turned on during a dark chlorination reaction the effects of chlorine dosage 5 20 mg l of chlorine and ph 6 9 were examined during the uv led chlorine reaction the ph of the reaction solution was maintained during the reactions with 5 mm phosphate buffer

during a 60 min reaction we sampled 5 ml of synthetic wastewater at several time points residual chlorine was quickly quenched with 0 1 m na2s2o3 solution 2 4 analytical methods we analyzed ery using

scientific 2 5 toxicity tests we estimated the acute toxicity of ery and its byproducts using the oecd toolbox v 4 2 http www qsartoolbox org this approach is recommended given the relatively high accuracy that can be achieved with respect to the quantitative structure activity relationship qsar ghanem et al 2017 it also avoids the ethical issues associated with animal testing in addition microtox tests were employed to determine time dependent acute toxicity trends during the uv led chlorine reaction using the luminescent bacteria alivibrio fischeri a fishceri gutierrez et al 2002 this method is widely used to measure acute toxicity a fischeri was exposed to the treated solution for 15 min and we then measured its luminescence intensity l t the luminescence intensity of the

state radical concentrations at each ph were determined using kintecus v 6 4 text s1 for calculating the contribution of oh during the uv led chlorine reaction we used nb as a radical probe since nb only reacts with oh while it does not react with other radicals fang et al 2014 the contribution of each reactive chlorine species rcs e g cl cl2 and clo was evaluated using competition kinetics with nb ba sbc and dmob respectively we spiked each radical scavenger or combination of radical scavengers into the synthetic wastewater to evaluate the relative contribution of radicals details of the radical scavenging experiments are provided in section 3 3 2 7 antibiotic resistant bacteria inactivation and antibiotic sensitivity test ery resistant escherichia coli e coli were isolated from hospital wastewater effluent ewha women s university medical center seoul south korea the number of beds 800 the isolation procedure for e coli is provided in text s2 to examine the inactivation ability of e coli during the uv led chlorine reaction 2 ml of e coli culture media was spiked into 498 ml of synthetic wastewater containing ery all conditions and procedures were the same as in the ery degradation kinetics experiment the inactivation rate was determined by the plate count technique with decimal serial dilution we counted the number of colonies in the diluted plates and then multiplied the value by the dilution ratio to determine the inactivation rate we further evaluated arg inactivation by counting the number of arg replications using a quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr method as described in a previous study yoon et al 2017 then we carried out a regression analysis to evaluate the gene inactivation rate zhang et al 2019 for antibiotic susceptibility testing we used a plasmid free geobacilluis stearothermophilus g stearothermophilus and bromothymol blue btb ph indicator biomed seoul south korea we cultured g stearothermophilus using lysogeny broth lb fluidic media with btb solution at 65 c for 2 5 h if g stearothermophilus is exposed to an antibiotic agent acidic metabolism does not occur and the color of the culture fluid remains blue microbial metabolism occurs if there is no residual antibiotic effect and the color of the culture fluid turns yellow wu et al 2019 3 results and discussion 3 1 degradation kinetics we first compared the ery removal during chlorination uv photolysis and uv led chlorine reaction fig 1 shows that the uv led chlorine reaction resulted in the highest degree of ery degradation followed by chlorination and uv photolysis reactions while chlorination achieved 62 removal over a period of 60 min 98 of ery degradation occurred during the uv led chlorine reaction over the same period fig 1 in contrast no degradation of ery was observed during uv led photolysis due to the lack of uv chromophores in ery deubel et al 2006 the chlorination and uv led chlorine reaction followed pseudo first order pfo kinetics r2 0 98 table s4 the observed rate constant k obs of the uv led chlorine reaction 8 7 10 2 min 1 was 3 6 times faster than that of the chlorination reaction 2 4 10 2 min 1 demonstrating the synergetic effect of uv led and chlorine this result may have been due to the production of selective or non selective oxidative radicals for example oh and rcs e g cl cl2 and clo can be produced during the uv led chlorine reaction as shown in eqs 1 6 fang et al 2014 guo et al 2017 jennings et al 2001 kläning and wolff 1985 matthew and anastasio 2006 zehavi and rabani 1972 these radicals can increase the degradation rate of ery in the uv led chlorine reaction 1 hocl o c l h v oh o cl 2 cl c l k 1 k 2 c l 2 k 1 6 5 10 9 m 1 s 1 k 2 1 1 10 5 s 1 3 oh hocl clo h 2 o k 2 0 10 9 m 1 s 1 4 oh o

k obs values in both the chlorination and uv led chlorine reactions as the chlorine concentration increased from 5 to 20 mg l the k obs values in the chlorination reaction linearly increased r2 0 98 however the k obs values for the uv led chlorine reaction linearly increased only from 5 to 15 mg l after 15 mg l the rate was saturated until 20 mg l implying that the excessive chlorine has a negative effect on ery removal the decrease in k obs at higher chlorine concentration may be due to that excessive amounts of chlorine can act as a scavenger of oh and cl radicals eq 3 to 6 fang et al 2014 guo et al 2017 previous studies reported a similar trend when using excessive chlorine during the lp uv chlorine process huang et al 2017 kong et al 2016 xiang et al 2016 the ph of the solution also affected the removal of ery during the chlorination and uv led chlorine reactions fig 2 b the highest k obs values were obtained at ph 8 in the chlorination reaction followed by ph 9 7 and 6 even though the neutral form of free chlorine hocl is considered as a stronger oxidant li and zhang 2012 cationic ery can more effectively react with ocl ion rather than hocl due to the electrostatic interaction pka of ery 8 9 however at ph 9 the neutral form of ery is dominant 55 while the protonated form of ery prevails at ph 7 and 8 98 55 goldman et al 1990 the neutral form of ery can react with free chlorine slower than the cationic form li and zhang 2012 causing k obs to be diminished at ph 9 during chlorination reactions during the uv led chlorine process the trend of k obs with ph was the same as that of chlorination reaction k obs value was highest at ph 8 followed by ph 9 ph 7 ph 6 this result can be explained in two ways first chlorination may have the same effect on k obs as uv led chlorine reaction secondly even though the quantum yield of ocl ion 0 8 mol e 1 is 2 5 times lower than that of hocl 2 0 mol e 1 at 275 nm uv kwon et al 2018 it is reported that the radical scavenging effect of ocl ion is 2 7 4 4 times higher than that of hocl eq 3 6 fang et al 2014 guo et al 2017 moreover the molar absorbance coefficient ε of ocl ion 245 m 1 cm 1 is 8 8 times higher than that of hocl 28 m 1 cm 1 kwon et al 2018 therefore the production of radicals from free chlorine during the uv led chlorine process can be significantly promoted at alkaline ph conditions however table s5 showed that the free chlorine consumption rate showed the highest at ph 8 followed by ph 9 7 and 6 it suggests that the radicals produced by chlorine consumption are most produced at ph 8 for this reason the k obs values might be decreased by 8 at ph 9 2 4 10 2 min 1 compared to ph 8 2 6 10 2 min 1 due to the higher fraction of ocl ion at ph 9 compared to ph 8 fig 3 3 3 contribution of radical species we investigated the contribution of each radical species during the uv led chlorine reaction of ery by investigating the degradation kinetics in the presence of various radical scavengers during the uv chlorine reaction various radicals can be produced including oh cl clo and other secondary radicals such as cl2 cloh o and the hydrated electron eaq however due to their relatively low oxidation potential and high selectivity of cl2 cloh and o the contributions of these species during the uv led chlorine reaction were overlooked hasegawa and neta 1978 grebel et al 2010 armstrong et al 2015 since these radicals also can contribute to the degradation of pollutants we further investigated the effect of overlooked radicals in this study the relative contribution of ery degradation kinetics k obs during uv led chlorine process can be expressed as eq 7 7 k o b s k c l 2 e r y c l 2 k oh ery o h s s k cl ery c l s s k clo ery c l o s s k others ery o t h e r s s s where k cl2 ery is a second order rate constant for ery degradation during chlorination k oh ery is a second order reaction rate constant of ery with oh m 1 s 1 oh ss is a steady state concentration of oh m k cl ery is a second order reaction rate constant of ery with cl m 1s 1 and cl ss is a steady state concentration of cl m k clo ery is a second order reaction rate constant of ery with clo m 1s 1 and clo ss is a steady state concentration of clo m k others ery is a second order reaction rate constant of ery with other secondary radicals m 1s 1 such as cl2 cloh o and eaq others ss is a steady state concentration of other secondary radicals cl2 cloh o and eaq m respectively the contribution of each radical species at each ph in eq 7 were evaluated using various radical scavengers first we determined the contribution of oh during the uv led chlorine reaction of ery in the presence of 13 μm of nb nb is known to react only with oh with a rate constant k oh nb of 3 9 109 m 1 s 1 while it does not react with other radicals fang et al 2014 oh ss can be determined using eq 8 table s8 and the k obs value k oh ery of ery with oh has been reported previously 3 8 109 m 1s 1 wols et al 2013 hence the contribution of oh k ery oh to ery degradation during the uv led reaction at different ph values can be calculated using eq 9 as 2 5 10 2 1 4 10 2 1 2 10 2 and 5 2 10 3 min 1 at ph 6 7 8 and 9 respectively 8 k nb k oh nb oh ss 9 k e r y o h k oh ery oh ss the relative contribution of cl during ery degradation can be directly determined by using a mixed system of nb 13 μm ba 13 μm and dmob 10 mm altogether while nb can only react with oh ba reacts with both cl and oh with the rate constants of 1 8 1010 m 1 s 1 and 5 9 109 m 1 s 1 respectively buxton et al 1988 also dmob was injected to eliminate the effect of clo because dmob can only react with clo with the rate constant of 2 1 109 m 1 s 1 alfassi et al 1988 then the steady state concentration of cl cl ss can be determined using eq 10 15 wang et al 2016 10 ln n b t n b 0 k o h n b o h s s 11 ln b a t b a 0 k o h b a o h s s k c l b a c l s s 12 o h s s s l o p e 1 k oh nb 13 c l s s s l o p e 2 k oh ba o h s s k cl ba 14 k e r y c l k cl ery c l s s where k cl ba and k oh ba is the second order rate constant of each radical with ba cl ss is the steady state concentration of cl slope 1 and slope 2 are the linearly fitted slopes of eq 10 and eq 11 respectively the observed steady state concentrations of cl at different phs can be determined by using eqs 12 and 13 table s8 the second order kinetic constant of ery with cl is known as 7 109 m 1s 1 lei et al 2019 so that the contribution of cl to ery degradation k ery cl at each ph can be directly determined by using eq 14 as 1 8 10 2 1 4 10 2 1 1 10 2 and 6 7 10 3 min 1 at ph 6 7 8 and 9 respectively the result showed that the contribution of cl kept increasing as the ph increased next the contribution of clo during the uv led chlorine reaction of ery can be determined by using the competitive kinetics in the presence of dmob and sbc scavengers to eliminate the effect of other radicals such as oh cl and cl2 we added an excessive amount of sbc while dmob only reacts with clo sbc reacts with oh cl and cl2 with the rate constants of 8 5 106 m 1 s 1 2 2 108 m 1 s 1 and 8 0 107 m 1 s 1 respectively fang et al 2014 the second order rate constants of ery 13 6 μm with clo in the presence of dmob 13 μm and sbc 100 mm can be obtained using eq 15 17 15 ln e r y 0 e r y t k c l o e r y k c l o d m o b ln d m o b 0 d m o b t 16 ln d m o b 0 d m o b t k clo dmob clo s s 17 k e r y c l o k c l o e r y c l o s s where k clo ery and k clo dmob is the second order rate constant of clo with the ery and dmob respectively the competitive kinetics results were shown in fig s2 r2 0 96 since k clo dmob value is reported from the previous study as 2 1 109 m 1 s 1 alfassi et al 1988 k clo ery value can be determined using eq 15 as 3 1 109 m 1 s 1 3 3 109 m 1 s 1 7 5 109 m 1 s 1 and 1 0 1010 m 1 s 1 at ph 6 7 8 and 9 respectively next the steady state concentrations of clo can be calculated using eq 16 table s8 showed that the production of clo ss was two orders higher than other radicals such as oh and cl finally the contribution of clo to ery degradation k ery clo was determined by eq 17 as 4 2 10 3 8 2 10 3 4 3 10 2 and 4 7 10 2 min 1 at ph 6 7 8 and 9 respectively table s9 moreover the contribution of cl2 radical during the uv led chlorine reaction was obtained by comparing the rate constant in the presence of an excessive amount of sbc 100 mm and dmob 10 mm the rate constant in the presence of ba 10 mm and dmob 10 mm it is reported that sbc can react with oh cl and cl2 with the rate constants of 8 5 106 m 1 s 1 2 2 108 m 1 s 1 and 8 0 107 m 1 s 1 respectively and dmob can react with clo with the rate constant of 2 1 109 m 1 s 1 in contrast ba can react with cl and oh with the rate constant of 1 8 1010 m 1 s 1 and 5 9 109 m 1 s 1 respectively this fact implies that while the system containing sbc and dmob together can scavenge oh cl clo and cl2 the system containing ba and dmob only scavenges oh cl and clo respectively the difference between the two systems can give us the cl2 radical during the uv led chlorine reaction however our result showed that no significant difference in k obs values between the two systems were obtained t test p 0 05 this result can be from that k cl2 ery 5 106 m 1s 1 is significantly lower than other radicals lei et al 2019 therefore we assumed that the effect of cl2 during the uv led chlorine reaction can be neglected finally to calculate the contribution of other secondary radicals kothers such as eaq o and cloh we subtracted the obtained contributions of chlorination reaction oh cl and clo respectively from the k obs values of ery degradation during the uv led chlorine reaction as shown in eq 18 18 k others ery o t h e r s s s k o b s k c l 2 e r y c l 2 k oh ery o h s s k cl ery c l s s k clo ery c l o s s among secondary radicals not only hydrated electron eaq but also other secondary radicals such as cloh and o can contribute during the uv led chlorine reaction however it is hard to calculate the contribution of each secondary radical directly due to a lack of scavengers especially we cannot obtain the contribution of the hydrated electron eaq because the scavengers for eaq such as chloroform h2o2 nitrous oxide and thymine can be interrupted by other factors such as uv free chlorine oh cl and clo respectively during the uv led chlorine reaction hart and fielden 1965 wu et al 2020 instead we can confirm that the effect of eaq among secondary radicals can be significantly decreased as ph decreases to acidic conditions because eaq can rapidly react with a proton h with a fast rate constant of 2 4 1010 m 1s 1 gordon et al 1963 also fig 3 showed that the effect of cloh and o can be minimal since the contribution of other secondary radicals was negligible at ph 6 these results imply that among secondary radicals if the contribution of cloh and o are still negligible in most ph ranges the contribution of eaq can be significantly increased as the ph increased to alkaline conditions as shown in fig 3 however further studies are still needed to identify the contribution of each secondary radical directly fig 3 summarized the relative radical contribution during the uv led chlorine process at various ph conditions based on radical contribution experiments the production of most radicals was the highest at ph 8 followed by 9 7 and 6 except for the oh also both oh and cl were significantly contributed at lower ph values while clo and other radicals such as eaq cloh and o increased their portions among the radicals as the ph increased to alkaline phs during the uv chlorine reaction of ery we further estimated the relative radical production using kintecus software ianni 2017 with chemical equations table s6 and the result is shown in table s7 the concentration of oh and cl was the highest at ph 6 and decreased until ph 9 while cl2 and clo concentrations were highest at ph 8 followed by ph 9 7 and 6 unfortunately the concentration of other secondary radicals was not calculated due to the lack of related chemical reactions the production pattern of the radicals was similar to the result of experimentally obtained relative radical contribution in this study table s8 a previous study also reported that a similar radical formation trend during lp uv chlorine treatment increased with increasing ph guo et al 2017 except for clo in the uv led chlorine reaction the production trends of oh and cl at each ph were almost the same in the lp uv chlorine system however the concentration of clo was the highest at ph 8 followed by ph 9 7 and 6 while there was no change of clo concentration at each ph condition in the lp uv chlorine system 3 4 identified byproducts six tentative byproducts were identified during the uv led chlorine process m z 750 4633 736 4491 720 4512 716 4565 702 4413 325 4926 respectively three of which were also identified during the chlorination only reaction m z 750 4633 736 4491 720 4512 mass errors of tentatively identified products were less than 5 ppm table s10 fig s3 shows the time profile of the detected byproducts according to this profile we proposed a possible degradation pathway of ery during the uv led chlorine and chlorination reactions fig 4 ery is made up of a 14 member large lactone ring macrolide with two sugars desosamine and cladinose itoh and inoue 2019 the major structural alteration occurred at the macrolide and cladinose moieties during the uv led chlorine reaction fig 4 byproduct 1 m z 750 4633 can be produced as a result of hydroxylation oh due to the formation of oh adduct and demethylation at the c 1 position of the macrolide group in ery since h abstraction and electron transfer can occur by rcs such as cl and clo byproduct 2 m z 736 4491 can be derived from further dehydrogenation 2h of ery the formation of byproduct 2 can be derived from the h abstraction reaction by cl and clo byproduct 3 m z 720 4512 was generated due to the attack by oh and cl clo followed by the loss of the methoxy group och3 at the cladinose since these electrophilic radicals prefer to react with electron rich moiety wu et al 2017 next byproduct 4 m z 716 4565 corresponds to the dehydration h2o of the macrolide moiety also byproduct 5 m z 702 4413 can be formed via the dehydrogenation 2h of cladinose and subsequent dehydroxylation oh of ery at the c 11 position the h abstraction is the evidence of the rcs attack minakata et al 2017 rcs played a key role of ery degradation as a previous study reported guo et al 2017 finally further radical attacks induce multiple structural modifications of macrolide and the loss of cladinose and desosamine leading to the formation of byproduct 6 m z 325 4926 except for byproduct 2 m z 736 4491 the tps mentioned above were also detected during the uv persulfate michael kordatou et al 2015 persulfate activated iron powder h2o 2 li et al 2017 uv c photolysis reactions voigt and jaeger 2017 and enzymatic treatment llorca et al 2015 3 5 residual antibiotic effect and arb arg inactivation we examined the residual antibiotic effect of the treated solution after the uv led chlorine reaction through antibiotic sensitization experiment using a novel microbiological method in microtiter plates for screening ery wu et al 2019 we used g stearothermophilus with a btb ph indicator if exposed to the antibiotic agent acidic metabolism does not occur and the color of the culture fluid remains blue conversely microbial metabolism occurs if there is no residual antibiotic effect and the culture fluid turns yellow wu et al 2019 the detection limit of this method was 50 μg l fig s5 fig 5 shows that even though only 14 8 of the toc was removed during 60 min of the uv led chlorine reaction fig 1 there was no residual antimicrobial activity of treated water this may have been due to the breakdown of an essential moiety in ery such as the macrolide group fig 4 as shown in fig 5 a there was no bacteria growth inhibition when we cultured bacteria in the tube with the treated sample it turned yellow in color after the uv led chlorine treatment fig 5 b while the untreated sample maintained its blue color due to metabolic inhibition by ery we further evaluated the inactivation rates of arb and arg during the uv led chlorine reaction of ery we achieved the best inactivation efficiency when using the uv led chlorine reaction followed by uv led irradiation and chlorination fig s6 radical production might induce synergistic inactivation as well as ery removal during the uv led chlorine reaction a recent study reported a similar result through rcs production in the lp uv chlorine reaction zhang et al 2019 unfortunately we did not obtain k obs values during arb inactivation due to its rapid removal fig s6 a however we could calculate the arg inactivation rate during uv led irradiation 7 8 10 3 min 1 and uv led chlorine treatment 8 7 10 3 min 1 fig s6 b the existence of antibiotics in the wastewater samples might inhibit arg inactivation 6 7 10 3 min 1 due to uv absorption and radical scavenging effects during the uv led chlorine process 6 log removal of arb was achieved within 5 min while we achieved only 16 1 arg removal within 20 min suggesting that further treatments are required to completely inactivate residual arg 3 6 acute toxicity evaluation there are some debates regarding whether the uv chlorine reaction is safe dong et al 2017 gao et al 2017 guo et al 2016 these arguments focus on the formation of known and unknown dbps during the lp uv chlorine process von gunten 2018 for this reason we examined the acute toxicity of the reaction solutions using a fischeri a fishceri is a luminescent marine bacteria sensitive to various chemicals that loses its luminescence when exposed to toxic chemicals it has been reported that ery does not have acute toxicity to a fischeri and it can exhibit hormesis at low concentrations of ery abbas et al 2018 in the current study there was no luminescence inhibition at the initial time point fig 6 however acute toxicity increased with increasing reaction time suggesting that some byproducts produced during the uv led chlorine and chlorination reactions are more toxic than ery as previously mentioned in contrast when the initial concentration of ery 1 0 mg l and free chlorine 1 5 mg l was 10 fold lower luminescence was still present fig 6 this result indicates that even byproducts were produced they did not induce toxicity at low concentrations we also estimated the potential toxicity of tentatively identified byproducts using the oecd toolbox v 4 2 qsar based on the structural toxicity induction database we ruled out toxicity for major dbps produced during uv chlorine reactions such as chcl3 and clo3 sun et al 2016 this is because the lc50 values for a fischeri chcl3 632 mg l clo3 34 510 mg l jennings et al 2001 vanwijk and hutchinson 1995 are known to be at least 2100 fold greater than those during the uv led chlorine process in the present study chcl3 0 3 mg l clo3 0 15 mg l fig s7 according to the eco toxicity estimation performed using oecd toolbox byproducts 4 and 5 have higher toxicity than ery whereas byproducts 1 2 3 and 6 have lower toxicity fig s8 this suggests that the toxicity increase during ery degradation under the uv led chlorine reaction may result from the production of byproducts 4 and 5 4 conclusions this study investigated the degradation kinetics of ery during a uv chlorine process driven by a 275 nm led the degradation of ery followed by pfo kinetics we observed the highest removal of ery at ph 8 during the uv chlorine process under this condition we found out cl clo and others played important roles while oh contributed mainly at acidic ph further studies on the contribution of other radicals should be conducted we tentatively identified six dbps there was no residual antibiotic effect after the uv led chlorine process and we did not observe an alarming level of dbp formation two byproducts byproducts 4 and 5 were more toxic than ery but under relatively realistic conditions they did not have an acute toxic effect in addition we confirmed the inactivation of arb and arg during the uv led chlorine process compared to lp uv uv led still has limitations such as low transmittance due to its lower output however uv led has high energy efficiency and a longer lifetime than a mercury lamp the results of our study imply that the uv led chlorine process can be applied to decentralized small scale

17594,the effect of nutrients on phytoplankton biomass in lakes continues to be a subject of debate by aquatic scientists however determining whether or not chlorophyll a chl is limited by phosphorus p and or nitrogen n is rarely considered using a probabilistic method in studies of hundreds of lakes across broad spatial extents several studies have applied a unified chl nutrient relationship to determine nutrient limitation but pose a risk of ecological fallacy because they neglect spatial heterogeneity in ecological contexts to examine whether or not chl is limited by p n or both nutrients in hundreds of lakes and across diverse ecological settings a probabilistic machine learning method bayesian network was applied spatial heterogeneity in ecological context was accommodated by the probabilistic nature of the results we analyzed data from 1382 lakes in 17 us states to evaluate the cause effect relationships between chl and nutrients observations of chl total phosphorus tp and total nitrogen tn were discretized into three trophic states oligo mesotrophic eutrophic and hypereutrophic to train the model we found that although both nutrients were related to chl trophic state tp was more related to chl than tn especially under oligo mesotrophic and eutrophic chl conditions however when the chl trophic state was hypereutrophic both tp and tn were important these results provide additional evidence that p limitation is more likely under oligo mesotrophic or eutrophic chl conditions and that co limitation of p and n occurs under hypereutrophic chl conditions we also found a decreasing pattern of the tn tp ratio with increasing chl concentrations which might be a key driver for the role change of nutrients previous work performed at smaller scales support our findings indicating potential for extension of our findings to other regions our findings enhance the understanding of nutrient limitation at macroscales and revealed that the current debate on the limiting nutrient might be caused by failure to consider chl trophic state our findings also provide prior information for the site specific eutrophication management of unsampled or data limited lakes keywords bayesian network eutrophication limiting nutrient macroscale data limited lakes 1 introduction nutrients including phosphorus p and nitrogen n are considered as main drivers of phytoplankton growth conley et al 2009 however which nutrient is the primary limiting nutrient remains a topic of substantial debate generally debate focuses on whether or not lakes are solely p limited or co limited by p and n some researchers propose that p is the only limiting nutrient based on results of whole lake experiments and historical observations correll 1999 schindler 1974 schindler et al 2016 they found that n fixation was sufficient for phytoplankton growth in proportion to p schindler et al 2008 other researchers challenged the p control paradigm mainly based on results of bottle or mesocosm experiments in which they found that the addition of n could also significantly promote phytoplankton growth elser et al 2007 xu et al 2009 while these small scale experiments of short duration were criticized to give spurious and confusing results schindler 2012 a few recent studies used long term observations to reveal n limitation in summer which was believed to support the notion of co limitation by p and n van gerven et al 2019 shatwell and köhler 2019 however short term n limitation as the evidence for controlling n has long been doubted carpenter 2008 schindler et al 2008 although whole lake experiments or historical observations provide useful information for informing lake eutrophication management schindler et al 2016 previous studies typically focused on a few selected lakes e g lakes in the experimental lakes area of canada schindler 2012 the laurentian great lakes chaffin et al 2013 dove and chapra 2015 and lake taihu paerl et al 2011 xu et al 2009 however several studies have shown that the spatial heterogeneity of ecological contexts including lake characteristics and phytoplankton and fish community structure could impact the relationship between chlorophyll a chl and nutrients malve and qian 2006 phillips et al 2008 wagner et al 2011 the chl nutrient relationship could vary among lakes even in the same ecoregion and under the same trophic conditions liang et al 2019 the variation of chl nutrient relationships might further change relative limitation strength of nutrients kolzau et al 2014 moreover the spatial heterogeneity of other factors e g climate and residence time could determine the availability of nutrients and thereby impact the limiting nutrient for phytoplankton genkai kato and carpenter 2005 lewis et al 2011 maranger et al 2018 therefore inferences deduced from a limited numbers of lakes might be constrained to certain ecological contexts large datasets of lakes located across varied ecological contexts have long been used to explore chl nutrient relationships canfield and bachmann 1981 dillon and rigler 1974 oliver et al 2017 rast et al 1983 a few studies also determined the limiting nutrient based on the performance of chl nutrient log linear regressions for example seip 1994 explored the limiting nutrient of 46 north temperate lakes based on the predictive ability of the chl nutrient model abell et al 2012 found that the chl nutrient relationship varied with latitude and further explored the nutrient limitation patterns based on the statistical significance of regression coefficients similarly zou et al 2020 determined the limiting nutrient of lakes in the chinese eastern plains these aforementioned studies always spatially aggregated data and then developed a unified chl nutrient relationship space for time substitution that was believed to be suitable for all lakes in the analysis as such the deduced limiting nutrient s for aggregated lakes are the same however because of the spatial heterogeneity of ecological contexts of lakes the regional relationship might not be applicable for some lakes more importantly as revealed in some recent studies liang et al 2020 qian et al 2019 the regional relationship might entirely over or under estimate the nutrient effect of all the lakes which is a typical phenomenon of ecological fallacy maashebner et al 2015 the deduced regional limiting nutrient could be thereby misleading classifying lakes into several types based on ecological contexts e g lake characteristics land use meteorological factors and phytoplankton community structure could improve chl nutrient model performance hayes et al 2015 phillips et al 2008 yuan and pollard 2014 and thereby provide more accurate information for deducing the limiting nutrient however the number of potential factors effecting nutrient limitation could be large in practice it is extremely difficult to collect data for many drivers and across hundreds of lakes as such if only a limited number of drivers are included in the modeling exercise there is still no guarantee that ecological fallacy won t occur therefore it is critical to apply effective tools to accommodate the spatial heterogeneity in ecological contexts that exists for inland lakes and at the same time help to overcome the data limitation often present when exploring nutrient limitation of lakes at macroscales as a probabilistic machine learning method bayesian network bn can implicitly reflect the impacts of drivers in a probabilistic manner rigosi et al 2015 rather than including many potential drivers in the model bn is therefore suitable for handling the spatial heterogeneity of ecological contexts and does not require additional data for potential drivers in a bn it is straightforward to conduct an analysis that provides easily communicated probability distributions of the response given the predictors conditions bn is also capable of accommodating nonlinear relationships chen and pollino 2012 in this study our objective was to examine whether or not chl is limited by p n or both nutrients in hundreds of lakes located across diverse ecological settings we applied bn to analyzed data from a temporally and spatially extensive database for lakes in 17 northeastern and midwest us states lagos ne soranno et al 2017 the usage of bn in developing chl nutrient relationships of one or multiple lakes is not new nojavan et al 2017 but its application as a tool to explore nutrient limitation of lakes that span a range of ecological contexts at macroscales is novel 2 methods although nutrients have many different forms total phosphorus tp and total nitrogen tn were used here as the indicators of nutrients due to data availability also tp and tn are the most widely used indicators in determining the limiting nutrient of phytoplankton cha et al 2016 liang et al 2019 søndergaard et al 2017 in north temperate lakes summer is the most sensitive season for phytoplankton growth so we focused our analysis on the summer period june 15 to september 14 wagner and schliep 2018 because there might be interannual dynamics of nutrient limitation even in the same lake we averaged tp tn and chl concentrations in the summer period of each year to obtain yearly lake summer average values this resulted in 6424 average values of tp tn and chl from 1382 lakes the lake summer average values were then used to determine the trophic state of tp tn and chl according to the classification method of the national lake assessment nla table 1 usepa 2009 2 1 bayesian network bn is a probabilistic machine learning method it is defined in terms of a directed acyclic graph and conditional distributions aguilera et al 2011 bn models are based on a relatively simple causal graphical structure making them easy to build and understand chen and pollino 2012 in addition the probabilistic representation of a bn model enables it to be a proper method to deal with uncertainties aguilera et al 2011 moreover the belief propagation makes bn models an effective tool for reasoning which makes them useful for helping to inform and support decision making chen and pollino 2012 as such bn models have been increasingly used in modeling ecological systems marcot and penman 2019 mclaughlin and reckhow 2017 yuan and pollard 2018 to build a credible bn model three key steps should be included namely the determination of model structure learning of model parameters and model evaluation in this study the model structure was very simple and was determined based on the basic understanding of lake ecosystems as shown in fig 1 tp and tn were drivers parents nodes and chl was the response variable child node note that although we gave the prior that both tn and tp could impact chl when determining the bn model structure that did not have to lead to the conclusion that both nutrients must have effects on the chl trophic state if a nutrient has no effect on the chl state the change of that nutrient will not cause any change on the distribution of the chl state distributions of the trophic state of the three variables are also shown in fig 1 the categorized data data that represent the trophic state of tp tn and chl were used as the input and output of the bn model although there are many other supervised or unsupervised methods to discretize nutrients and chl concentrations beuzen et al 2018 our nla guided data discretization method table 1 is management oriented and thus was expected to provide useful information for lake eutrophication management parameters estimation was based on bayes theorem which is embedded in the bnlearn package scutari 2010 in the r software we conducted a 10 fold cross validation for the bn model in which the model was fitted 10 times to 90 of the observations while the remaining 10 was retained for out of sample prediction wagner and schliep 2018 we used classification accuracy to evaluate model performance the classification accuracy was calculated by comparing highest probability predictions to observed real outcomes marcot 2012 the classification accuracy was high 76 4 ensuring the reliability of model results and corresponding inferences the top down reasoning of the calibrated bn model allows us to determine the probability of a chl tropic state under certain trophic states of tp and tn for example we can obtain the probability of chl being oligo mesotrophic o when setting tp to be oligo mesotrophic and tn to be eutrophic or hypereutrophic e or h as expressed by p chl o tp o tn e or h expressions before and after the vertical bar represent the event and evidence respectively and we obtain the probability of the event the trophic state of chl under the evidence trophic states of nutrients via top down reasoning note that we aggregated data from a large number of lakes located across diverse ecological contexts a unified deterministic chl nutrient relationship e g a linear regression model to determine nutrient limitation could be misleading because of ecological fallacy qian et al 2019 in our study the key advantage of the application of bn is the implicit accounting of the effects of potential drivers by the probabilistic results of chl state given the trophic state of the nutrients we emphasize that the probability of a chl trophic state should be interpreted as the proportion of lakes whose chl concentration is in that certain state rather than the possibility of that certain chl state in a given lake for example p chl o 0 3 means there are 30 of the lakes whose chl state are oligo mesotrophic rather than that for a certain lake the probability of chl being oligo mesotrophic is 0 3 by comparing probabilities of the chl trophic state under different combinations of nutrient trophic states we can explore the role of tp and tn on phytoplankton specifically we addressed the following three questions 1 is chl limited by nutrients although the answer to this question seems to be well established it is rarely discussed based on the results of analyses that examine hundreds of lakes using a bn in which the potential effects of spatial heterogeneity of ecological contexts are implicitly accounted for 2 if chl is limited by nutrients is chl limited by both nutrients or only one 3 if chl is limited by both nutrients is there one nutrient that is more important than the other one while there are many combinations of tp and tn trophic state that are used as the evidence to calculate the probability of the chl trophic state in the bn we focused on the nutrient trophic state combinations which were helpful to answer the above questions all the computations were conducted in r software version 3 6 0 r core team 2019 we developed the bn using the bnlearn package scutari 2010 3 results probabilities of chl trophic states under different combinations of tp and tn trophic states are shown in fig 2 to answer the question of whether nutrients affect the chl trophic state we can compare the results of the chl trophic state when both nutrients are oligo mesotrophic fig 2g and when both nutrients are eutrophic fig 2e or hypereutrophic fig 2c when both nutrients are oligo mesotrophic the probability of chl being oligo mesotrophic is high 0 793 and the probability of chl being eutrophic or hypereutrophic is small 0 201 and 0 006 respectively however if nutrient trophic state becomes eutrophic or hypereutrophic the probability of chl being oligo mesotrophic decreases greatly to 0 104 and 0 023 respectively that is on one hand the trophic state of 68 9 0 793 0 104 of lakes will shift to a more enriched chl trophic state when both nutrients become eutrophic and 78 7 0 793 0 006 of lakes will shift to a more enriched chl state when both nutrients become hypereutrophic on the other hand when nutrient trophic state becomes oligo mesotrophic from eutrophic or hypereutrophic the proportion of lakes being classified as eutrophic and hypereutrophic based on the chl concentrations is greatly reduced e g compare fig 2b e and h therefore tp and tn are indeed very important for determining the chl trophic state of lakes indicating that chl is limited by nutrients at macroscales next we address the question of whether or not a single nutrient or both nutrients affect chl trophic state given that we have established that nutrients are important determinants of chl trophic state to explore the effect of one nutrient independent of the other we kept the trophic state of the other nutrient constant for example we can determine the effect of tp on chl trophic state by comparing fig 2a d and g when setting the tn trophic state to be oligo mesotrophic changing the tp trophic state from oligo mesotrophic fig 2g to eutrophic fig 2d or hypereutrophic fig 2a will lead to a large decrease of the probability of chl being oligo mesotrophic a decline from 0 793 when tp is oligo mesotrophic to 0 056 when tp is hypereutrophic concurrently we see an increase in the probability of chl being eutrophic and hypereutrophic fig 2g d a when holding the tn state constant at eutrophic fig 2b e h or hypereutrophic fig 2c f i we obtain similar results to the results for tp on the probability change of the chl trophic state to determine the effect of tn on chl trophic state we compare plots holding the tp trophic state constant if the tp state is oligo mesotrophic figs 2g h i changing the trophic state of tn from oligo mesotrophic to eutrophic or hypereutrophic will cause a decrease in the probability of chl being oligo mesotrophic from 0 793 when tn is oligo mesotrophic to 0 609 when tn is hypereutrophic and an increase of the probability of chl being eutrophic and hypereutrophic figs 2g h i if the tp state is eutrophic fig 2d e f or hypereutrophic fig 2a b c changing the trophic state of tn from oligo mesotrophic to eutrophic or hypereutrophic will primarily lead to the shift of the chl state from eutrophic to hypereutrophic since the probability of chl being oligo mesotrophic is already very small therefore according to the change of the probability of different chl trophic states both tp and tn could influence the chl trophic state showing that both nutrients could be limiting to determine the relative importance of nutrients since both nutrients could influence the chl trophic state we assume that both nutrients are oligo mesotrophic and then shift either nutrient to a more nutrient enriched trophic state the shift of the tp trophic state to a eutrophic state will lead to 67 7 0 793 0 126 of the lakes transferring from an oligo mesotrophic trophic state to a eutrophic or hypereutrophic state and 74 7 0 793 0 056 of lakes transferring from an oligo mesotrophic trophic state to a eutrophic or hypereutrophic state if tp shifts to a hypereutrophic state figs 2g h i in contrast the shift of tn to a eutrophic state or hypereutrophic state will only cause such a change for 12 7 0 793 0 664 and 18 4 0 793 0 609 of the lakes respectively fig 2g d a in addition the shift of the tp state to a hypereutrophic state will lead to a larger proportion of lakes being classified as hypereutrophic based on chl 0 374 a much larger proportion than that resulting from the shift of tn 0 015 moreover when tp trophic state is hypereutrophic the probability of chl being oligo mesotrophic is as small as 0 006 fig 2a and changing the tn trophic state from oligo mesotrophic to hypereutrophic has little influence on that probability fig 2c however when the tn trophic state is hypereutrophic changing the tp trophic state from oligo mesotrophic to hypereutrophic results in a large decrease in the probability of chl being oligo mesotrophic from 0 609 to 0 023 fig 2i c therefore although tn has an influence on the chl state tp is substantially more important than tn considering the huge difference between the tp and tn effect and the large effect of tp on chl trophic state tp generally plays a dominant role in determining the chl state indicating that tp seems more important for limiting chl compared to tn finally we examined if tp and tn could interactively impact the chl trophic state we found that when the tp trophic state was oligo mesotrophic changing the tn trophic state from oligo mesotrophic to eutrophic or hypereutrophic would only cause a small increase in the probability of chl being hypereutrophic fig 2g h i however when the tp state was eutrophic or hypereutrophic the probability of chl being hypereutrophic increased substantially when changing the tn trophic state from oligo mesotrophic to eutrophic or hypereutrophic fig 2d e f for tp in a eutrophic state and fig 2a b c when tp is in a hypereutrophic state that is the impact of the tn state on the chl state is much larger when the tp state is eutrophic or hypereutrophic indicating that there is a positive interaction between tp and tn in determining the hypereutrophic state of chl when either tp or tn goes to oligo mesotrophic from being eutrophic or hypereutrophic this will lead to a relatively large decrease in the probability of chl being hypereutrophic therefore when the chl state is hypereutrophic both nutrients are likely important and suggests potential co limitation by tp and tn we further checked the robustness of the above results by changing the sampling period lake depth and thresholds to determine the chl state we set the sampling years 2000 2005 2010 1995 2000 and 2005 and the mean lake depth 3 m 5 m 3 m and 5 m we tried another popular method determining the chl state proposed by smith et al 1999 by which the lake is oligo mesotrophic when chl 9 µg l is eutrophic when chl 9 µg l but 25 µg l and is hypereutrophic when chl 25 µg l note that thresholds in smith et al 1999 are similar to those in usepa 2009 we found that all the results had a similar pattern therefore our results are very robust which gives strength to the reliability of the analysis 4 discussion 4 1 the role of tp and tn on limiting chl we summarized whether or not chl is limited by tp tn or both nutrients in inland lakes at macroscales although both nutrients affect chl trophic state tp generally plays a dominant role however when the chl trophic state is hypereutrophic both tp and tn are important our findings on the role of nutrients indicate p limitation when the chl trophic state is not hypereutrophic and the co limitation of p and n when the chl trophic state is hypereutrophic the tn tp ratio is one of the most widely used indicators to explain the nutrient limitation for phytoplankton cha et al 2016 liang et al 2018 redfield 1958 it is well recognized that a higher tn tp ratio indicates a higher possibility of p limitation we found a significant decreasing trend the fitted linear regression line in fig 3 of the tn tp ratio with increasing chl concentration for the lakes in the lagos ne database fig 3 as the tn tp ratio approaches the redfield ratio 7 2 by mass the dashed horizontal line in fig 3 the nutrient limitation condition shifts from p limitation to that of co limitation by p and n average values of the tn tp ratio are 54 1 26 8 and 18 1 white points in fig 3 when the chl state is oligo mesotrophic eutrophic and hypereutrophic respectively according to the linear regression line between log tn tp and log chl we can set the chl concentration to be 30 µg l the threshold to determine the eutrophic and hypertrophic state and calculate the corresponding tn tp ratio as a rough estimation of the tn tp ratio to classify the p limitation and co limitation of p and n the estimated tn tp ratio is 20 2 which is close to the proposal of 22 by guildford and hecky 2000 there are several mechanisms that may influence the tn tp ratio in lakes such as watershed nutrient input and atmospheric deposition of nutrients downing and mccauley 1992 elser et al 2009 two processes that are most related to the chl trophic state are the release of p from the sediment and the denitrification of n in the waterbody cottingham et al 2015 zhang et al 2018 the decomposition of phytoplankton was identified as the key process to the release of p from the sediment by providing the low dissolved oxygen and proper ph environment supporting the iron ii p coupling chen et al 2018 moreover lake eutrophication often leads to nuisance blooms of some phytoplankton species e g cylindrospermopsis raciborskii which are able to regulate their metabolism to accommodate conditions of low dissolved inorganic phosphorus araujo et al 2018 figueredo et al 2014 wu et al 2012 p thereby would increase faster in the waterbody than n meanwhile the decomposition of phytoplankton leads to the increase of total organic carbon which could fuel the potential denitrification rate zhang et al 2018 moreover n fixation usually cannot compensate for the loss of n caused by denitrification van gerven et al 2019 hayes et al 2018 at the continental scale net denitrification will lead to a larger n deficit in more productive lakes scott et al 2019 as such it appears that p accumulates faster than n in more eutrophic lakes that are heavily impacted by anthropogenic activities yan et al 2016 globally a decreasing trend of the tn tp ratio with increasing chl concentration has also been shown yan et al 2016 found a similar negative relationship between the tn tp ratio and chl using worldwide data compiled from 157 publications some studies also found a decreasing trend of the tn tp ratio with the increase of tp concentration based on compiled datasets downing and mccauley 1992 sterner 2008 which also indicated the negative correlation of the tn tp ratio with chl concentrations considering the high positive correlation between chl and tp across a larger latitudinal range from 70 s to 83 n abell et al 2012 found that tn tp ratios were smaller in lakes with a higher trophic state the same negative relationship between the tn tp ratio and chl has also been shown in the same lake over time for example the tn tp ratio decreased with the increasing eutrophication in lakes such as dianchi taihu and okeechobee yan et al 2016 similarly the tn tp ratio increased during the lake recovery period in the laurentian great lakes dove and chapra 2015 and some chinese lakes tong et al 2018 besides the tn tp ratio would be smaller in summer than that in the other seasons because of the higher chl concentration in summer ding et al 2018 our findings on the role of limiting nutrients are deduced from cross sectional data however our results are supported by several case studies i e non compiled cross sectional databases worldwide table 2 for example for some lakes in the experimental lakes area of canada schindler 2012 schindler et al 2008 and the laurentian great lakes dove and chapra 2015 whose chl states were oligo mesotrophic or eutrophic the limiting nutrient was identified as tp in some hypereutrophic lakes e g lake dianchi and lake taihu in china both tn and tp were determined as limiting nutrients wu et al 2017 xu et al 2009 in addition søndergaard et al 2017 found that chl was generally more strongly related to tp than to tn but tn could be important to the variability of chl at high tp concentrations 107 µg l based on the observations of 817 danish lakes similarly filstrup and downing 2017 revealed that chl was weakly related to tn when tp concentration was low but displayed a much stronger response to tn at higher tp concentrations 100 µg l for lakes located in an agricultural region in the midwestern us these high tp concentrations in both studies always corresponded to the hypereutrophic state of chl considering the high correlation between chl and tp the importance of tn at high tp concentrations indicates the importance of tn when the chl state is hypereutrophic these studies also support the dominant role of tp when the chl state is not hypereutrophic and the dual role of tp and tn when chl is hypereutrophic because our analysis was performed using data from over 1300 lakes that spanned a wide range of trophic states and ecological contexts and because our results are supported be several single lake and multi lake studies from across the globe we believe that our findings have great potential for generalizing to other lakes therefore our findings are helpful to better understand the role of limiting nutrients and provide further insight to the current controversy on limiting nutrients for example the debate over limiting nutrients might be caused by trying to answer the same question but under two different chl trophic state conditions researchers insisting on p limitation might focus on the lakes with oligo mesotrophic or eutrophic chl trophc state while researchers finding evidence of co limitation by p and n might have focused efforts in lakes with hypereutrophic chl conditions table 2 it appears likely that the difference in chl state was neglected in previous studies 4 2 implications for management of lake eutrophication it is impossible to propose a unique strategy for lake eutrophication management that is applicable for all lakes given the spatial and temporal variability of ecological contexts moal et al 2019 qian et al 2019 wagner et al 2011 although deductions based on our findings cannot be generalized to all lakes since our findings are deduced from spatially aggregated data they are suitable for providing some general guidance for lake eutrophication management for many lakes considering the impossibility of a unified law general guidance suitable for a large number of lakes is critical our findings would provide important prior information for site specific eutrophication management particularly for unsampled or data limited lakes firstly for the recovery of hypereutrophic lakes decreasing concentrations of both tp and tn would likely be advantageous the probability of chl being hypereutrophic reduced by a large proportion when the tp state changed from hypereutrophic to eutrophic or oligo mesotrophic state left panel in fig 4 the probability of chl being hypereutrophic would be reduced by more than a half from 25 6 and 25 2 to 11 4 when the tn state becomes oligo mesotrophic right panel in fig 4 secondly note that the co limitation by p and n when chl is hypereutrophic does not have to lead to the strategy that both nutrients should be controlled in practice harpole et al 2011 because the reduction of either nutrient would be helpful however we should be aware that controlling tp solely imposes a high risk of causing a hypereutrophic state of chl fig 2c e if for example there is an abrupt tp concentration increase caused by a sudden or extreme event in other words an oligo mesotrophic or eutrophic lake with a higher tn concentration has less resiliency the ability to keep the original state to an abrupt increase in tp concentration than a lake with a lower tn concentration finally to maintain the oligo mesotrophic state of a lake maintaining an oligo mesotrophic tp state will be important maintaining an oligo mesotrophic tp state would result in a more than 70 of lakes being in an oligo mesotrophic chl state however the change of tn trophic state will not lead to a large proportion change of chl oligo mesotrophic state similarly to further recover a lake to the oligo mesotrophic state a decrease in tp will be more effective than a decrease in tn 4 3 importance of a large dataset and the use of a bayesian network the novelty of our research is due to two primary factors examining effects of n and p across hundreds of lakes and the application of bn at macroscales we emphasize the importance of using a dataset with large numbers of lakes and with a wide range of different ecological contexts rather than using a limited number of lakes to explore the role of tp and tn as potential limiting nutrients the extension of results deduced from a limited number of lakes to a broader population of lakes might improperly identify the limiting nutrient and misinform lake eutrophication management for example as shown by our probabilistic results there is a proportion of lakes whose chl trophic state will be oligo mesotrophic when the tp state is hypereutrophic left panel in fig 4 if research focused only on these lakes we might conclude that tp is not related to the chl trophic state i e that chl is not limited by tp while tp is in fact very important for many other lakes the extension of the corresponding strategy for lake eutrophication control might be also ineffective for other lakes similarly there are a large proportion of lakes whose chl state is eutrophic or hypereutrophic when tp state is hypereutrophic left panel in fig 4 the generalization of nutrient limitation deduction from these lakes to other lakes could also be misleading our work also highlights the novel application of bn in exploring the role of p and n on chl at macroscales as shown in figs 2 and 4 under certain nutrient states the chl state is not deterministic but probabilistic reflecting impacts of spatial heterogeneity of drivers that were not included in the analysis we argue that the application of bn could be encouraged as an effective tool for use in macrosystem studies firstly bn implicitly accounted for impacts of spatial heterogeneity of ecological contexts and avoided the risk of ecological fallacy secondly although classifying ecosystems is useful for improving our understanding of ecological processes data used for classification could be rare particularly for many systems at macroscales under this circumstance bn allows the probabilistic exploration of response drivers relationship finally if we are also interested in the effect of other factors or the data of potential drivers become available adding other factors as predictors in bn is straightforward in the future it will be critical to identify drivers of the limiting nutrient at both the regional and site specific scales so the limiting nutrient of a lake can be determined more accurately according to its ecological context this would enable predicting limiting nutrients to unsampled or data limited lakes which could better inform the site specific eutrophication management at macroscales 5 conclusions we explored the tp vs tn limitation in inland lakes at macroscales the novel application of bn allowed us to directly build chl nutrient relationships without collecting extra data of potential drivers of nutrient limitation results showed that tp generally played a more important role on driving phytoplankton biomass than tn when chl is in a hypereutrophic state both tp and tn are important we revealed that the current debate on the limiting nutrient might be caused by failure to consider chl trophic state our findings enhance the understanding of nutrient limitation at macroscalea which could also facilitate eutrophication management of unsampled or data limited lakes declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

17594,the effect of nutrients on phytoplankton biomass in lakes continues to be a subject of debate by aquatic scientists however determining whether or not chlorophyll a chl is limited by phosphorus p and or nitrogen n is rarely considered using a probabilistic method in studies of hundreds of lakes across broad spatial extents several studies have applied a unified chl nutrient relationship to determine nutrient limitation but pose a risk of ecological fallacy because they neglect spatial heterogeneity in ecological contexts to examine whether or not chl is limited by p n or both nutrients in hundreds of lakes and across diverse ecological settings a probabilistic machine learning method bayesian network was applied spatial heterogeneity in ecological context was accommodated by the probabilistic nature of the results we analyzed data from 1382 lakes in 17 us states to evaluate the cause effect relationships between chl and nutrients observations of chl total phosphorus tp and total nitrogen tn were discretized into three trophic states oligo mesotrophic eutrophic and hypereutrophic to train the model we found that although both nutrients were related to chl trophic state tp was more related to chl than tn especially under oligo mesotrophic and eutrophic chl conditions however when the chl trophic state was hypereutrophic both tp and tn were important these results provide additional evidence that p limitation is more likely under oligo mesotrophic or eutrophic chl conditions and that co limitation of p and n occurs under hypereutrophic chl conditions we also found a decreasing pattern of the tn tp ratio with increasing chl concentrations which might be a key driver for the role change of nutrients previous work performed at smaller scales support our findings indicating potential for extension of our findings to other regions our findings enhance the understanding of nutrient limitation at macroscales and revealed that the current debate on the limiting nutrient might be caused by failure to consider chl trophic state our findings also provide prior information for the site specific eutrophication management of unsampled or data limited lakes keywords bayesian network eutrophication limiting nutrient macroscale data limited lakes 1 introduction nutrients including phosphorus p and nitrogen n are considered as main drivers of phytoplankton growth conley et al 2009 however which nutrient is the primary limiting nutrient remains a topic of substantial debate generally debate focuses on whether or not lakes are solely p limited or co limited by p and n some researchers propose that p is the only limiting nutrient based on results of whole lake experiments and historical observations correll 1999 schindler 1974 schindler et al 2016 they found that n fixation was sufficient for phytoplankton growth in proportion to p schindler et al 2008 other researchers challenged the p control paradigm mainly based on results of bottle or mesocosm experiments in which they found that the addition of n could also significantly promote phytoplankton growth elser et al 2007 xu et al 2009 while these small scale experiments of short duration were criticized to give spurious and confusing results schindler 2012 a few recent studies used long term observations to reveal n limitation in summer which was believed to support the notion of co limitation by p and n van gerven et al 2019 shatwell and köhler 2019 however short term n limitation as the evidence for controlling n has long been doubted carpenter 2008 schindler et al 2008 although whole lake experiments or historical observations provide useful information for informing lake eutrophication management schindler et al 2016 previous studies typically focused on a few selected lakes e g lakes in the experimental lakes area of canada schindler 2012 the laurentian great lakes chaffin et al 2013 dove and chapra 2015 and lake taihu paerl et al 2011 xu et al 2009 however several studies have shown that the spatial heterogeneity of ecological contexts including lake characteristics and phytoplankton and fish community structure could impact the relationship between chlorophyll a chl and nutrients malve and qian 2006 phillips et al 2008 wagner et al 2011 the chl nutrient relationship could vary among lakes even in the same ecoregion and under the same trophic conditions liang et al 2019 the variation of chl nutrient relationships might further change relative limitation strength of nutrients kolzau et al 2014 moreover the spatial heterogeneity of other factors e g climate and residence time could determine the availability of nutrients and thereby impact the limiting nutrient for phytoplankton genkai kato and carpenter 2005 lewis et al 2011 maranger et al 2018 therefore inferences deduced from a limited numbers of lakes might be constrained to certain ecological contexts large datasets of lakes located across varied ecological contexts have long been used to explore chl nutrient relationships canfield and bachmann 1981 dillon and rigler 1974 oliver et al 2017 rast et al 1983 a few studies also determined the limiting nutrient based on the performance of chl nutrient log linear regressions for example seip 1994 explored the limiting nutrient of 46 north temperate lakes based on the predictive ability of the chl nutrient model abell et al 2012 found that the chl nutrient relationship varied with latitude and further explored the nutrient limitation patterns based on the statistical significance of regression coefficients similarly zou et al 2020 determined the limiting nutrient of lakes in the chinese eastern plains these aforementioned studies always spatially aggregated data and then developed a unified chl nutrient relationship space for time substitution that was believed to be suitable for all lakes in the analysis as such the deduced limiting nutrient s for aggregated lakes are the same however because of the spatial heterogeneity of ecological contexts of lakes the regional relationship might not be applicable for some lakes more importantly as revealed in some recent studies liang et al 2020 qian et al 2019 the regional relationship might entirely over or under estimate the nutrient effect of all the lakes which is a typical phenomenon of ecological fallacy maashebner et al 2015 the deduced regional limiting nutrient could be thereby misleading classifying lakes into several types based on ecological contexts e g lake characteristics land use meteorological factors and phytoplankton community structure could improve chl nutrient model performance hayes et al 2015 phillips et al 2008 yuan and pollard 2014 and thereby provide more accurate information for deducing the limiting nutrient however the number of potential factors effecting nutrient limitation could be large in practice it is extremely difficult to collect data for many drivers and across hundreds of lakes as such if only a limited number of drivers are included in the modeling exercise there is still no guarantee that ecological fallacy won t occur therefore it is critical to apply effective tools to accommodate the spatial heterogeneity in ecological contexts that exists for inland lakes and at the same time help to overcome the data limitation often present when exploring nutrient limitation of lakes at macroscales as a probabilistic machine learning method bayesian network bn can implicitly reflect the impacts of drivers in a probabilistic manner rigosi et al 2015 rather than including many potential drivers in the model bn is therefore suitable for handling the spatial heterogeneity of ecological contexts and does not require additional data for potential drivers in a bn it is straightforward to conduct an analysis that provides easily communicated probability distributions of the response given the predictors conditions bn is also capable of accommodating nonlinear relationships chen and pollino 2012 in this study our objective was to examine whether or not chl is limited by p n or both nutrients in hundreds of lakes located across diverse ecological settings we applied bn to analyzed data from a temporally and spatially extensive database for lakes in 17 northeastern and midwest us states lagos ne soranno et al 2017 the usage of bn in developing chl nutrient relationships of one or multiple lakes is not new nojavan et al 2017 but its application as a tool to explore nutrient limitation of lakes that span a range of ecological contexts at macroscales is novel 2 methods although nutrients have many different forms total phosphorus tp and total nitrogen tn were used here as the indicators of nutrients due to data availability also tp and tn are the most widely used indicators in determining the limiting nutrient of phytoplankton cha et al 2016 liang et al 2019 søndergaard et al 2017 in north temperate lakes summer is the most sensitive season for phytoplankton growth so we focused our analysis on the summer period june 15 to september 14 wagner and schliep 2018 because there might be interannual dynamics of nutrient limitation even in the same lake we averaged tp tn and chl concentrations in the summer period of each year to obtain yearly lake summer average values this resulted in 6424 average values of tp tn and chl from 1382 lakes the lake summer average values were then used to determine the trophic state of tp tn and chl according to the classification method of the national lake assessment nla table 1 usepa 2009 2 1 bayesian network bn is a probabilistic machine learning method it is defined in terms of a directed acyclic graph and conditional distributions aguilera et al 2011 bn models are based on a relatively simple causal graphical structure making them easy to build and understand chen and pollino 2012 in addition the probabilistic representation of a bn model enables it to be a proper method to deal with uncertainties aguilera et al 2011 moreover the belief propagation makes bn models an effective tool for reasoning which makes them useful for helping to inform and support decision making chen and pollino 2012 as such bn models have been increasingly used in modeling ecological systems marcot and penman 2019 mclaughlin and reckhow 2017 yuan and pollard 2018 to build a credible bn model three key steps should be included namely the determination of model structure learning of model parameters and model evaluation in this study the model structure was very simple and was determined based on the basic understanding of lake ecosystems as shown in fig 1 tp and tn were drivers parents nodes and chl was the response variable child node note that although we gave the prior that both tn and tp could impact chl when determining the bn model structure that did not have to lead to the conclusion that both nutrients must have effects on the chl trophic state if a nutrient has no effect on the chl state the change of that nutrient will not cause any change on the distribution of the chl state distributions of the trophic state of the three variables are also shown in fig 1 the categorized data data that represent the trophic state of tp tn and chl were used as the input and output of the bn model although there are many other supervised or unsupervised methods to discretize nutrients and chl concentrations beuzen et al 2018 our nla guided data discretization method table 1 is management oriented and thus was expected to provide useful information for lake eutrophication management parameters estimation was based on bayes theorem which is embedded in the bnlearn package scutari 2010 in the r software we conducted a 10 fold cross validation for the bn model in which the model was fitted 10 times to 90 of the observations while the remaining 10 was retained for out of sample prediction wagner and schliep 2018 we used classification accuracy to evaluate model performance the classification accuracy was calculated by comparing highest probability predictions to observed real outcomes marcot 2012 the classification accuracy was high 76 4 ensuring the reliability of model results and corresponding inferences the top down reasoning of the calibrated bn model allows us to determine the probability of a chl tropic state under certain trophic states of tp and tn for example we can obtain the probability of chl being oligo mesotrophic o when setting tp to be oligo mesotrophic and tn to be eutrophic or hypereutrophic e or h as expressed by p chl o tp o tn e or h expressions before and after the vertical bar represent the event and evidence respectively and we obtain the probability of the event the trophic state of chl under the evidence trophic states of nutrients via top down reasoning note that we aggregated data from a large number of lakes located across diverse ecological contexts a unified deterministic chl nutrient relationship e g a linear regression model to determine nutrient limitation could be misleading because of ecological fallacy qian et al 2019 in our study the key advantage of the application of bn is the implicit accounting of the effects of potential drivers by the probabilistic results of chl state given the trophic state of the nutrients we emphasize that the probability of a chl trophic state should be interpreted as the proportion of lakes whose chl concentration is in that certain state rather than the possibility of that certain chl state in a given lake for example p chl o 0 3 means there are 30 of the lakes whose chl state are oligo mesotrophic rather than that for a certain lake the probability of chl being oligo mesotrophic is 0 3 by comparing probabilities of the chl trophic state under different combinations of nutrient trophic states we can explore the role of tp and tn on phytoplankton specifically we addressed the following three questions 1 is chl limited by nutrients although the answer to this question seems to be well established it is rarely discussed based on the results of analyses that examine hundreds of lakes using a bn in which the potential effects of spatial heterogeneity of ecological contexts are implicitly accounted for 2 if chl is limited by nutrients is chl limited by both nutrients or only one 3 if chl is limited by both nutrients is there one nutrient that is more important than the other one while there are many combinations of tp and tn trophic state that are used as the evidence to calculate the probability of the chl trophic state in the bn we focused on the nutrient trophic state combinations which were helpful to answer the above questions all the computations were conducted in r software version 3 6 0 r core team 2019 we developed the bn using the bnlearn package scutari 2010 3 results probabilities of chl trophic states under different combinations of tp and tn trophic states are shown in fig 2 to answer the question of whether nutrients affect the chl trophic state we can compare the results of the chl trophic state when both nutrients are oligo mesotrophic fig 2g and when both nutrients are eutrophic fig 2e or hypereutrophic fig 2c when both nutrients are oligo mesotrophic the probability of chl being oligo mesotrophic is high 0 793 and the probability of chl being eutrophic or hypereutrophic is small 0 201 and 0 006 respectively however if nutrient trophic state becomes eutrophic or hypereutrophic the probability of chl being oligo mesotrophic decreases greatly to 0 104 and 0 023 respectively that is on one hand the trophic state of 68 9 0 793 0 104 of lakes will shift to a more enriched chl trophic state when both nutrients become eutrophic and 78 7 0 793 0 006 of lakes will shift to a more enriched chl state when both nutrients become hypereutrophic on the other hand when nutrient trophic state becomes oligo mesotrophic from eutrophic or hypereutrophic the proportion of lakes being classified as eutrophic and hypereutrophic based on the chl concentrations is greatly reduced e g compare fig 2b e and h therefore tp and tn are indeed very important for determining the chl trophic state of lakes indicating that chl is limited by nutrients at macroscales next we address the question of whether or not a single nutrient or both nutrients affect chl trophic state given that we have established that nutrients are important determinants of chl trophic state to explore the effect of one nutrient independent of the other we kept the trophic state of the other nutrient constant for example we can determine the effect of tp on chl trophic state by comparing fig 2a d and g when setting the tn trophic state to be oligo mesotrophic changing the tp trophic state from oligo mesotrophic fig 2g to eutrophic fig 2d or hypereutrophic fig 2a will lead to a large decrease of the probability of chl being oligo mesotrophic a decline from 0 793 when tp is oligo mesotrophic to 0 056 when tp is hypereutrophic concurrently we see an increase in the probability of chl being eutrophic and hypereutrophic fig 2g d a when holding the tn state constant at eutrophic fig 2b e h or hypereutrophic fig 2c f i we obtain similar results to the results for tp on the probability change of the chl trophic state to determine the effect of tn on chl trophic state we compare plots holding the tp trophic state constant if the tp state is oligo mesotrophic figs 2g h i changing the trophic state of tn from oligo mesotrophic to eutrophic or hypereutrophic will cause a decrease in the probability of chl being oligo mesotrophic from 0 793 when tn is oligo mesotrophic to 0 609 when tn is hypereutrophic and an increase of the probability of chl being eutrophic and hypereutrophic figs 2g h i if the tp state is eutrophic fig 2d e f or hypereutrophic fig 2a b c changing the trophic state of tn from oligo mesotrophic to eutrophic or hypereutrophic will primarily lead to the shift of the chl state from eutrophic to hypereutrophic since the probability of chl being oligo mesotrophic is already very small therefore according to the change of the probability of different chl trophic states both tp and tn could influence the chl trophic state showing that both nutrients could be limiting to determine the relative importance of nutrients since both nutrients could influence the chl trophic state we assume that both nutrients are oligo mesotrophic and then shift either nutrient to a more nutrient enriched trophic state the shift of the tp trophic state to a eutrophic state will lead to 67 7 0 793 0 126 of the lakes transferring from an oligo mesotrophic trophic state to a eutrophic or hypereutrophic state and 74 7 0 793 0 056 of lakes transferring from an oligo mesotrophic trophic state to a eutrophic or hypereutrophic state if tp shifts to a hypereutrophic state figs 2g h i in contrast the shift of tn to a eutrophic state or hypereutrophic state will only cause such a change for 12 7 0 793 0 664 and 18 4 0 793 0 609 of the lakes respectively fig 2g d a in addition the shift of the tp state to a hypereutrophic state will lead to a larger proportion of lakes being classified as hypereutrophic based on chl 0 374 a much larger proportion than that resulting from the shift of tn 0 015 moreover when tp trophic state is hypereutrophic the probability of chl being oligo mesotrophic is as small as 0 006 fig 2a and changing the tn trophic state from oligo mesotrophic to hypereutrophic has little influence on that probability fig 2c however when the tn trophic state is hypereutrophic changing the tp trophic state from oligo mesotrophic to hypereutrophic results in a large decrease in the probability of chl being oligo mesotrophic from 0 609 to 0 023 fig 2i c therefore although tn has an influence on the chl state tp is substantially more important than tn considering the huge difference between the tp and tn effect and the large effect of tp on chl trophic state tp generally plays a dominant role in determining the chl state indicating that tp seems more important for limiting chl compared to tn finally we examined if tp and tn could interactively impact the chl trophic state we found that when the tp trophic state was oligo mesotrophic changing the tn trophic state from oligo mesotrophic to eutrophic or hypereutrophic would only cause a small increase in the probability of chl being hypereutrophic fig 2g h i however when the tp state was eutrophic or hypereutrophic the probability of chl being hypereutrophic increased substantially when changing the tn trophic state from oligo mesotrophic to eutrophic or hypereutrophic fig 2d e f for tp in a eutrophic state and fig 2a b c when tp is in a hypereutrophic state that is the impact of the tn state on the chl state is much larger when the tp state is eutrophic or hypereutrophic indicating that there is a positive interaction between tp and tn in determining the hypereutrophic state of chl when either tp or tn goes to oligo mesotrophic from being eutrophic or hypereutrophic this will lead to a relatively large decrease in the probability of chl being hypereutrophic therefore when the chl state is hypereutrophic both nutrients are likely important and suggests potential co limitation by tp and tn we further checked the robustness of the above results by changing the sampling period lake depth and thresholds to determine the chl state we set the sampling years 2000 2005 2010 1995 2000 and 2005 and the mean lake depth 3 m 5 m 3 m and 5 m we tried another popular method determining the chl state proposed by smith et al 1999 by which the lake is oligo mesotrophic when chl 9 µg l is eutrophic when chl 9 µg l but 25 µg l and is hypereutrophic when chl 25 µg l note that thresholds in smith et al 1999 are similar to those in usepa 2009 we found that all the results had a similar pattern therefore our results are very robust which gives strength to the reliability of the analysis 4 discussion 4 1 the role of tp and tn on limiting chl we summarized whether or not chl is limited by tp tn or both nutrients in inland lakes at macroscales although both nutrients affect chl trophic state tp generally plays a dominant role however when the chl trophic state is hypereutrophic both tp and tn are important our findings on the role of nutrients indicate p limitation when the chl trophic state is not hypereutrophic and the co limitation of p and n when the chl trophic state is hypereutrophic the tn tp ratio is one of the most widely used indicators to explain the nutrient limitation for phytoplankton cha et al 2016 liang et al 2018 redfield 1958 it is well recognized that a higher tn tp ratio indicates a higher possibility of p limitation we found a significant decreasing trend the fitted linear regression line in fig 3 of the tn tp ratio with increasing chl concentration for the lakes in the lagos ne database fig 3 as the tn tp ratio approaches the redfield ratio 7 2 by mass the dashed horizontal line in fig 3 the nutrient limitation condition shifts from p limitation to that of co limitation by p and n average values of the tn tp ratio are 54 1 26 8 and 18 1 white points in fig 3 when the chl state is oligo mesotrophic eutrophic and hypereutrophic respectively according to the linear regression line between log tn tp and log chl we can set the chl concentration to be 30 µg l the threshold to determine the eutrophic and hypertrophic state and calculate the corresponding tn tp ratio as a rough estimation of the tn tp ratio to classify the p limitation and co limitation of p and n the estimated tn tp ratio is 20 2 which is close to the proposal of 22 by guildford and hecky 2000 there are several mechanisms that may influence the tn tp ratio in lakes such as watershed nutrient input and atmospheric deposition of nutrients downing and mccauley 1992 elser et al 2009 two processes that are most related to the chl trophic state are the release of p from the sediment and the denitrification of n in the waterbody cottingham et al 2015 zhang et al 2018 the decomposition of phytoplankton was identified as the key process to the release of p from the sediment by providing the low dissolved oxygen and proper ph environment supporting the iron ii p coupling chen et al 2018 moreover lake eutrophication often leads to nuisance blooms of some phytoplankton species e g cylindrospermopsis raciborskii which are able to regulate their metabolism to accommodate conditions of low dissolved inorganic phosphorus araujo et al 2018 figueredo et al 2014 wu et al 2012 p thereby would increase faster in the waterbody than n meanwhile the decomposition of phytoplankton leads to the increase of total organic carbon which could fuel the potential denitrification rate zhang et al 2018 moreover n fixation usually cannot compensate for the loss of n caused by denitrification van gerven et al 2019 hayes et al 2018 at the continental scale net denitrification will lead to a larger n deficit in more productive lakes scott et al 2019 as such it appears that p accumulates faster than n in more eutrophic lakes that are heavily impacted by anthropogenic activities yan et al 2016 globally a decreasing trend of the tn tp ratio with increasing chl concentration has also been shown yan et al 2016 found a similar negative relationship between the tn tp ratio and chl using worldwide data compiled from 157 publications some studies also found a decreasing trend of the tn tp ratio with the increase of tp concentration based on compiled datasets downing and mccauley 1992 sterner 2008 which also indicated the negative correlation of the tn tp ratio with chl concentrations considering the high positive correlation between chl and tp across a larger latitudinal range from 70 s to 83 n abell et al 2012 found that tn tp ratios were smaller in lakes with a higher trophic state the same negative relationship between the tn tp ratio and chl has also been shown in the same lake over time for example the tn tp ratio decreased with the increasing eutrophication in lakes such as dianchi taihu and okeechobee yan et al 2016 similarly the tn tp ratio increased during the lake recovery period in the laurentian great lakes dove and chapra 2015 and some chinese lakes tong et al 2018 besides the tn tp ratio would be smaller in summer than that in the other seasons because of the higher chl concentration in summer ding et al 2018 our findings on the role of limiting nutrients are deduced from cross sectional data however our results are supported by several case studies i e non compiled cross sectional databases worldwide table 2 for example for some lakes in the experimental lakes area of canada schindler 2012 schindler et al 2008 and the laurentian great lakes dove and chapra 2015 whose chl states were oligo mesotrophic or eutrophic the limiting nutrient was identified as tp in some hypereutrophic lakes e g lake dianchi and lake taihu in china both tn and tp were determined as limiting nutrients wu et al 2017 xu et al 2009 in addition søndergaard et al 2017 found that chl was generally more strongly related to tp than to tn but tn could be important to the variability of chl at high tp concentrations 107 µg l based on the observations of 817 danish lakes similarly filstrup and downing 2017 revealed that chl was weakly related to tn when tp concentration was low but displayed a much stronger response to tn at higher tp concentrations 100 µg l for lakes located in an agricultural region in the midwestern us these high tp concentrations in both studies always corresponded to the hypereutrophic state of chl considering the high correlation between chl and tp the importance of tn at high tp concentrations indicates the importance of tn when the chl state is hypereutrophic these studies also support the dominant role of tp when the chl state is not hypereutrophic and the dual role of tp and tn when chl is hypereutrophic because our analysis was performed using data from over 1300 lakes that spanned a wide range of trophic states and ecological contexts and because our results are supported be several single lake and multi lake studies from across the globe we believe that our findings have great potential for generalizing to other lakes therefore our findings are helpful to better understand the role of limiting nutrients and provide further insight to the current controversy on limiting nutrients for example the debate over limiting nutrients might be caused by trying to answer the same question but under two different chl trophic state conditions researchers insisting on p limitation might focus on the lakes with oligo mesotrophic or eutrophic chl trophc state while researchers finding evidence of co limitation by p and n might have focused efforts in lakes with hypereutrophic chl conditions table 2 it appears likely that the difference in chl state was neglected in previous studies 4 2 implications for management of lake eutrophication it is impossible to propose a unique strategy for lake eutrophication management that is applicable for all lakes given the spatial and temporal variability of ecological contexts moal et al 2019 qian et al 2019 wagner et al 2011 although deductions based on our findings cannot be generalized to all lakes since our findings are deduced from spatially aggregated data they are suitable for providing some general guidance for lake eutrophication management for many lakes considering the impossibility of a unified law general guidance suitable for a large number of lakes is critical our findings would provide important prior information for site specific

probability of chl being hypereutrophic reduced by a large proportion when the tp state changed from hypereutrophic to eutrophic or oligo mesotrophic state left panel in fig 4 the probability of chl being hypereutrophic would be reduced by more than a half from 25 6 and 25 2 to 11 4 when the tn state becomes oligo mesotrophic right panel in fig 4 secondly note that the co limitation by p and n when chl is hypereutrophic does not have to lead to the strategy that both nutrients should be controlled in practice harpole et al 2011 because the reduction of either nutrient would be helpful however we should be aware that controlling tp solely imposes a high risk of causing a hypereutrophic state of chl fig 2c e if for example there is an abrupt tp concentration increase caused by a sudden or extreme event in other words an oligo mesotrophic or eutrophic lake with a higher tn concentration has less resiliency the ability to keep the original state to an abrupt increase in tp concentration than a lake with a lower tn concentration finally to maintain the oligo mesotrophic state of a lake maintaining an oligo mesotrophic tp state will be important maintaining an oligo mesotrophic tp state would result in a more than 70 of lakes being in an oligo mesotrophic chl state however the change of tn trophic state will not lead to a large proportion change of chl oligo mesotrophic state similarly to further recover a lake to the oligo mesotrophic state a decrease in tp will be more effective than a decrease in tn 4 3 importance of a large dataset and the use of a bayesian network the novelty of our research is due to two primary factors examining effects of n and p across hundreds of lakes and the application of bn at macroscales we emphasize the importance of using a dataset with large numbers of lakes and with a wide range of different ecological contexts rather than using a limited number of lakes to explore the role of tp and tn as potential limiting nutrients the extension of results deduced from a limited number of lakes to a broader population of lakes might improperly identify the limiting nutrient and misinform lake eutrophication management for example as shown by our probabilistic results there is a proportion of lakes whose chl trophic state will be oligo mesotrophic when the tp state is hypereutrophic left panel in fig 4 if research focused only on these lakes we might conclude that tp is not related to the chl trophic state i e that chl is not limited by tp while tp is in fact very important for many other lakes the extension of the corresponding strategy for lake eutrophication control might be also ineffective for other lakes similarly there are a large proportion of lakes whose chl state is eutrophic or hypereutrophic when tp state is hypereutrophic left panel in fig 4 the generalization of nutrient limitation deduction from these lakes to other lakes could also be misleading our work also highlights the novel application of bn in exploring the role of p and n on chl at macroscales as shown in figs 2 and 4 under certain nutrient states the chl state is not deterministic but probabilistic reflecting impacts of spatial heterogeneity of drivers that were not included in the analysis we argue that the application of bn could be encouraged as an effective tool for use in macrosystem studies firstly bn implicitly accounted for impacts of spatial heterogeneity of ecological contexts and avoided the risk of ecological fallacy secondly although classifying ecosystems is useful for improving our understanding of ecological processes data used for classification could be rare particularly for many systems at macroscales under this circumstance bn allows the probabilistic exploration of response drivers relationship finally if we are also interested in the effect of other factors or the data of potential drivers become available adding other factors as predictors in bn is straightforward in the future it will be critical to identify drivers of the limiting nutrient at both the regional and site specific scales so the limiting nutrient of a lake can be determined more accurately according to its ecological context this would enable predicting limiting nutrients to unsampled or data limited lakes which could better inform the site specific eutrophication management at macroscales 5 conclusions we explored the tp vs tn limitation in inland lakes at macroscales the novel application of bn allowed us to directly build chl nutrient relationships without collecting extra data of potential drivers of nutrient limitation results showed that tp generally played a more important role on driving phytoplankton biomass than tn when chl is in a hypereutrophic state both tp and tn are important we revealed that the current debate on the limiting nutrient might be caused by failure to consider chl trophic state our findings enhance the understanding of nutrient limitation at macroscalea which could also facilitate eutrophication management of unsampled or data limited lakes declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known
