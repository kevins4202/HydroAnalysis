21965,this paper proposes an ais data based model to accurately estimate vessels travel time and its distribution between any two points in a narrow channel it is crucial to know the travel time plus its distribution between some critical points for traffic control the model has two components 1 to identify a vessel s destination dock and its arrival and departure times the key is how to separate a vessel s trips and 2 to estimate a vessel s travel time from its destination dock or a specific point to another specific point or vice versa travel time between two points is called traversal time the proposed algorithms were then applied to the houston ship channel hsc with the ais data of 11 months in 2017 focusing on the outbound trips in the section above the beltway 8 bridge through the travel times of cargos and tankers from their destination docks to a point are likely to be normally distributed their traversal times between two points are more likely to be lognormally distributed the traversal time distribution is significantly impacted by vessel width draft and type but independent from time of day and month the adjacent link traversal times are also highly positively correlated keywords travel time travel time distribution ais data houston ship channel 1 introduction the port of houston is the second busiest seaports in the united states in terms of total tonnage according to the data of 2013 aapa 2015 about 200 private and public industrial terminals stretch along the 52 mile long houston ship channel hsc and each year more than 8200 vessels and 215 000 barges carries more than 247 million tons of cargo through the hsc port of houston 2019 the hsc plays a critical role in supporting texas energy and petrochemical industries fig 1 shows the map of the hsc broadly speaking it can be divided into two sections the lower one goes through galveston ship channel and is constraint by galveston sea buoys and the upper one is constraint by actual riverbanks san jacinto river and buffalo bayou the hsc is about 45 ft 14 m deep so it can accommodate big ships the hsc is narrow especially the upper section near houston as the inside channel marked in fig 1 this paper only focuses on this upper section with so many vessels moving through the channel every day many vessels suffer from serious delays caused by various reasons one of the important reasons comes from big ships as they could block the entire channel when moving through some narrow sections to better estimate the delay and further to develop a solution scheme to optimize the vessel flows in the hsc it is firstly necessary to understand the property of travel time of vessels in different types and sizes currently the knowledge of travel time of vessels in the channel is obtained largely based on pilots experience and work reports such data mainly come from reports this paper summarizes a preliminary study in the project on how to optimize the traffic flow in the hsc with a focus on how to accurately estimate the travel time of vessels from one specific location to another such specific points indicate specific sections for example the beltway 8 bridge in the hsc is an important landmark in the section of the channel above the bridge the channel can only hold one big ship with a beam of 106 ft 32 m or more and the opposing traffic for big ships has to be interrupted even it is a preliminary study 3 problems are challengeable 1 for one vessel how to separate the ais data of one trip from others 2 how to tell a vessel s arrival and departure times for different trips based on all ais points close to the destination dock and 3 how to precisely estimate a vessel s arrival time at any point in a channel by solving these questions the travel time of a vessel in a channel between two points can be found then another interesting question is how are vessels travel times distributed and which factors impact the travel time distributions note that though this paper only focuses on big ships cargos and tankers in the hsc the proposed method can be applied to any big ship in inland narrow channels with docks an inland narrow channel usually is made by dredging a natural riverbed to a certain depth to accommodate big ships therefore the navigation routes of big ships are strictly constrained within a channel including the routes connected to docks such a constraint makes it possible to answer the above questions simply based on the navigation data of vessels for this reason the proposed method cannot be applied to small vessels such as tugs because they can be moored anywhere near the bank since 2002 new ships and all sea going vessels that have 300 gross tons or more as well as all passenger vessels are required to equip an automatic identification system ais on board the ais transmits the sailing status information between vessels and from vessels to shore or vice versa the ais data contains the detailed and consecutive temporal and spatial information of a vessel vessel id name width length type as well as real maneuvering behavior of a vessel such as longitude latitude speed course heading draft etc at every 1 min of a vessel for this reason recently ais data are widely used in waterway transportation research including the risk analysis of vessel collisions vessel travel behavior modeling estimate of vessel trajectory etc the ais data provide us a good and reliable source of data to study the travel time of vessels in the channel for example they can be used to estimate the delay suffered by vessels the delay here is referred to the waiting time of vessels due to various reasons such as navigation restrictions beam width restrictions of vessels etc in the channel recently the application of ais data mainly focuses on two directions risk analysis of navigation and vessels travel behavior analysis to analyze the risk of vessel collision and or groundings many studies were based on the concept of ship domain horteborn et al 2019 which is a surrounding effective waters a ship navigator want to keep clear of other vessels or fixed objectives goodwin 1975 through the analysis of ais data researchers studied the frequency of a vessel s ship domain incursion where the ship domain was defined in various shapes e g see montewka et al 2010 qu et al 2011 weng et al 2014 and wu et al 2016 other ais data based methods were also proposed for example mou et al 2010 developed ais data based linear regression models to evaluate the risk of vessel collisions off the port of rotterdam based on two indicators closest point of approach cpa and time to closest point of approach tcpa between two vessels zaman et al 2014 proposed an ais data based fuzzy fmea model to evaluate the risk of vessel collisions in the malacca strait and huang et al 2019 proposed ais data based crossing line and monte carlo methods to assess the risk of groundings in kaohsiung harbor the former aims to assess the ship grounding probability and the latter is used to simulate ship trajectory so as to evaluate the grounding frequency since they provide the detailed information of vessel status continuously ais data become an important source to investigate vessels travel behavior in critical sections of the channels in order to better understand the capacity of the channel 1 1 the capacity of a section of channel refers to the number of vessels able to go through the section of a channel in the unit time this is the maximum traffic volume considering weather conditions vessel size vessel s behavior speed safe distance and so on liu et al 2016 as well as to more efficiently arrange vessel traffic in the channel xiao et al 2015 investigated the travel behavior of vessels including the distributions of vessel speeds courses and arrival time intervals at two spots one near the port of rotterdam and another near shanghai based on ais data wu et al 2018 looked at how tankers and cargos pass through the hotspots in the sabine neches waterways snww identified in their previous study wu et al 2016 interestingly they found that different from highway traffic the mean travel time of vessels seems to be independent of the traffic density such independence was also found at the entrance of the galveston ship channel roy and wu 2019 kang et al 2018 also studied the relationship between mean travel time of vessels and traffic density in 15 legs in the singapore strait however they found that the travel time is correlated with density the difference between two studies may be from vessel volumes the singapore strait sees much more vessel volumes than the snww and galveston ship channel further kang et al 2019 investigated how ships pass through an l shaped channel in the singapore strait focusing on ships acceleration and deceleration pattern zhou et al 2019 proposed an ais data based method to classify ships through clustering their travel behavior the amount of ais data is huge unavoidably there exists outliers and missing data how to efficiently remove outliers and make up missing data is a big challenge various methods were proposed zhang et al 2018 a spline model to reconstruct vessels trajectories this model was shown to be able to fit any types of trajectories even with circles and clearly capture the navigation behavior of vessels through trajectory construction outliers can be identified and missing data can be made up kang et al 2019 proposed a series of algorithms to check the longitude and latitude speed and course wu et al 2016 2018 on the other hand employed statistical method and spatial relation functions in geographic information system gis packages to remove outliers estimating travel time at highway and roadways has been widely studied in the literature the california department of transportation caltrans suggested that travel time can provide information in various forms to assist managers traffic engineers planners freeway users and researchers choe et al 2002 a number of studies attempted to develop algorithms for estimating travel time at highways using advanced systems such as video image processing automatic vehicle identification cellular phone tracking and probe vehicles for example turner 1996 jiyoun et al 2008 and el esawey et al 2011 estimated travel time on a road network by using travel time relationships with neighbor links when the sample data set is small nie et al 2012 estimated each road segment s travel time distribution based on the data from loop detectors and electric toll records for the chicago metropolitan road network and wang et al 2014 estimated travel time of any path in a city using map data sources and gps trajectories such models were used for applications such as traffic monitoring chawla et al 2012 taxi dispatching yuan et al 2013 and travel time reliability analysis nie et al 2012 wu and nie 2013 wu 2013 travel time data were also used for various applications in waterway studies using the houston pilot transit data rahimikelarijani et al 2018 and kaneria et al 2019 used travel times to determine the optimal closure scenario in the hsc due to the demolition and re construction of the beltway 8 bridge for minimizing vessel waiting time for estimating travel time of ships on inland waterways asamer and prandtstetter 2014 developed two methods based on historical and currently observed velocities from the recorded ship trajectories for estimating ship travel times in an inland waterway dijoseph and mitchell 2015 proposed a method to establish baseline travel time statistics using archived ais position in an inland river system and riley et al 2015 used ais data and river stage data for analyzing the relationship between vessel transit times and water levels and for measuring vessel travel times over two years but none of these above mentioned studies is about trip separation and arrival time estimation at any point in a channel e g the study of dijoseph and mitchell 2015 is based on the given ais positions in the channel an ais dataset may cover a long time period in which a vessel could visit the channel of interest more than once to estimate vessels travel time based on ais data it is important to identify different trips of a vessel this study aims to build a more general method to determine the travel time of vessels in a channel covering any segment considering different vessel types and navigation status such as the travel time from the departure or the travel time under normal navigation status it is the major methodological contribution of this paper by building the travel time inventory the travel time reliability of different types of vessels can be obtained and the delay can be quantitatively estimated this opens the door for optimizing the traffic flow of vessels in a narrow and busy channel such as the closure and vessel scheduling in the hsc in order to schedule a closure e g due to dredging tasks or construction at a specific location of a waterway the vessel traffic service vts needs to consider vessel travel time to the closed section of the channel to determine the best time for closure the best closure time minimizes the total waiting time of all arrival and sailing vessels affected by the closure although pilots and coast guard constantly work with real time ais data no historical estimations are integrated with their system to optimize the operation another application is vessel scheduling pilots need to schedule and order vessels in the channel the complexity of the scheduling arises from navigation restrictions imposed on vessels based on their sizes for example vessels with beam width greater that 106 ft 32m are one way traffic restricted above the beltway 8 bridge or liquefied petroleum gas lpg tankers with length greater than 560 ft 171 m are daylight restricted in the hsc such limitations increase the congestion in the channel and potentially generate delays for other vessels optimizing navigation at the channel considering different navigation rules directly needs travel time estimation the reminder of this article is organized as follows section 2 gives the methodological framework used to estimate travel time of vessels in the channel section 3 describes the numerical examples where the property of travel time of big ships such as tankers and cargos in the hsc was investigated and section 4 concludes the paper 2 methodology 2 1 arrival and departure time at destination dock as to those questions mentioned at the beginning this section aims to answer the first two 1 to determine the destination dock of a big ship and 2 to determine the arrival and departure times of a big ship at its destination dock 2 1 1 model formulation to investigate the travel time inventory of vessels in a busy narrow channel it is necessary to find the destination docks of a vessel as well as its arrival time at this dock and departure time from this dock because the speeds of a vessel near its destination dock will be very different from those when a vessel is in normal navigation status also to build the travel time inventory it is necessary to find the destination dock of a vessel as its destination and origin in the dataset on vessel information the destination of this vessel is reported however such destination only refers to the destination port a port usually has many docks as shown in fig 2 a there are totally 81 docks along the hsc given a narrow channel like the hsc which have a large number of big ships such as tankers and cargos the water depth near docks are much larger than the depth near the bank without dock therefore for a big ship if its ais points are close to one dock as shown in fig 2 it implies that this dock is the destination dock of this ship given a set of ais data for one vessel if it had only one destination dock and visited this destination dock only once then it would be easy to determine this vessel s destination dock and the corresponding arrival and departure times respectively we can get the information by simply checking all of this vessel s ais data which are close to docks e g within the buffer of this dock see fig 2 b however a given ais dataset usually covers the whole month it is possible that a vessel may visit more than one destination dock and or visit a dock more than once for this reason it is necessary to develop a general algorithm to identify the destination dock and the arrival and departure times respectively when applying to the ais data of the hsc the buffer radius is 150 ft 46 m to determine the destination dock of a vessel only the ais data inside the buffer are analyzed to study the arrival and departure time at the destination dock by doing this the ais data with spatial error are excluded for further analysis consider an inland waterway transportation system with a series of docks j 1 2 n d and vessels i 1 2 n v where n d and n v refer to the numbers of unique docks and vessels in this system respectively then denote δ i j 1 if vessel i was moored at dock j and δ i j 0 otherwise for vessel i an ais point contains the following information at one timestamp t longitude latitude speed over ground sog and course over ground cog in the following text speed and course are used referring to sog and cog respectively these types of information for vessel i are denoted as x i t y i t s i t and c i t respectively given a timestamp the ais point of a vessel can be uniquely identified it implies that given t i x i t y i t s i t and c i t can be identified moreover the timestamp series of two different vessels are not the same for example for one vessel the timestamp series are 2018 08 01 00 01 00 2018 08 01 00 02 02 2018 08 01 00 03 04 while another one s timestamp series can be 2018 08 01 00 01 15 2018 08 01 00 02 16 2018 08 01 00 03 14 such inconsistency of timestamps increases the difficulty of ais data analysis on the other hand if δ i j 1 let λ i j k and μ i j k be the arrival and departure times of vessel i at dock j in its k th visit respectively where j 1 2 n i j and n i j refers to the number of visits of vessel i to dock j to get λ i j k and τ i j k we need to define a subset of the ais points of vessel i the ais points in this subset should be close enough to the dock implying the moored status or the status close to the moored status such a subset can be obtained through a gis tool such as function buffer available in popular gis packages such as arcgis and postgis the purpose of using a buffer is to filter data for the next step analysis so as to avoid scanning the entire dataset as aforementioned the buffer radius is set to be 150 ft about 46 m based on the geometric property of the hsc as shown in fig 2 b vessel i s ais points within the buffer of dock j form the aforementioned subset denoted as γ i j to reduce the complexity of notations in the following text for vessel i we simply use s i t γ i j or c i t γ i j to indicate the speed or the course of an ais point that is inside the buffer of dock j as to timestamps we denote τ i j as the subset of vessel i s timestamps at which the ais points are inside the buffer of dock j and t i j as the complimentary of τ i j i e the subset of vessel i s timestamps at which the ais points are outside the buffer of dock j please refer to appendix b at the end of the paper for the full list of notations then the arrival and departure times of vessel i at dock j from its k th visit i e λ i j k and μ i j k can be determined based on the following two formulations respectively note that at the arrival or departure time a vessel s speed sog is 0 as shown in conditions 2 and 4 respectively 1 λ i j k min t i μ i j k 1 t i τ i j t i 2 s t s i t 0 s i t γ i j k 2 n i j 3 μ i j k max t i ζ i j k t i τ i j t i 4 s t s i t 0 s i t γ i j 5 ζ i j k min t i λ i j k t i t i j t i k 1 n i j where t i is the timestamp of vessel i associated with an ais point and ζ i j k in condition 5 is an auxiliary variable referring to the earliest timestamp after vessel i left the buffer of dock j after its k th visit to dock j to solve λ i j k and μ i j k respectively the following boundary conditions are needed 6 λ i j 1 min t i τ i j t i where s i t 0 s i t γ i j μ i j n i j max t i τ i j t i where s i t 0 s i t γ i j n i j 1 i f t i i n λ i j 1 t i μ i j n i j we have t i t i j where λ i j 1 and μ i j n i j refer to the arrival time of the first visit k 1 and the departure time of the last visit k n i j respectively n i j is the number of visits made by vessel i at dock j and t i refers to a timestamp associated with an ais point of vessel i the last boundary condition implies that for vessel i there is only one visit i e n i j 1 if no ais point between the arrival time of its first visit and the departure time of its last visit is outside the buffer of dock j this idea of determining the arrival and departure times is also illustrated in fig 3 as shown in formulations 1 6 the arrival time is regarded as the earliest time when a vessel s speed is 0 after it enters the buffer of a dock and the departure time is regarded as the latest time when its speed is 0 before leaving the buffer note that the berthing and un berthing process for a big ship to a dock is complicated however since the focus of this paper is an inland channel made by dredging the riverbed to a certain depth to accommodate big ships a big ship s route is strictly limited within the channel of a waterway river therefore when a big ship is found close to a dock it can be regarded in the process of berthing or unberthing moreover the constraints on speed and timestamp can exclude the error data given a large data set e g 11 months ais data were considered in this paper the impact of such error could be marginal see the details in section 3 2 1 2 solution algorithm to solve formations 1 6 one key is to separate trips made by vessel i at dock j i e determining k it can be solved through an iterative procedure after determining the arrival and departure times of the first visit k 1 starting from k 2 the arrival time of the k t h visit must be the earliest time with speed of 0 i e s i t 0 where t λ i j k larger than the departure time of the k 1 t h visit once the arrival time of the k th visit i e λ i j k is determined the trip of the k th visit is thus separated by repeating this procedure the trip of each visit can be separated until we cannot find an arrival time later than the departure time of the last visit the following gives the details of this iterative algorithm based on vessel i s ais data input ais dataset of vessel i and the geometric location of dock j step 1 for dock j define a buffer then based on the ais dataset of vessel i employ gis function buffer to define a set of ais data γ i j step 2 based on γ i j find λ i j 1 μ i j n i j respectively if λ i j 1 and or μ i j n i j cannot be found it implies that vessel i may not be moored at dock j it may just pass by with a small distance to the dock it could happen to small vessels such as tugs then let δ i j 0 and go to vessel i 1 to restart this procedure otherwise let δ i j 1 and go to step 3 step 3 if n i j 1 based on the last condition of eq 6 implying that there is only one visit let μ i j 1 μ i j n i j and then record the λ i j 1 and μ i j 1 respectively go to the next vessel i 1 and restart otherwise if n i j 1 go to step 4 step 4 at k 1 determine ζ i j k according to eq 5 then based on ζ i j k determine departure time μ i j k according to formations 3 4 go to step 5 step 5 at k k 1 solve arrival time λ i j k based on μ i j k 1 according to formulations 1 2 and then determine ζ i j k based on ζ i j k determine departure time μ i j k repeat this step until μ i j k μ i j n i j for many large ships such as tankers and cargos the number of visits at one dock in a month is no more than 1 and only a few have 2 visits but for small vessels such as tugs or harbor vessels the number of visits in a month can be more than 10 actually it is found that the aforementioned method can accurately determine the arrival and departure times of big ships see the next section on numerical experiments however for small vessels some errors exist because as mentioned before these small vessels can be moored near any bank due to their small drafts in this paper only big ships are focused on 2 2 timestamp of passing by a dock now we aim to answer the last question how to precisely estimate a vessel s arrival time at any point in a channel the model and algorithm developed in the following can be applied to any point in a channel as mentioned in the first section in a narrow channel where many docks are located a big vessel s movement can affect the navigation of many others which need to leave from these docks therefore it is important to know the vessels travel time from one dock to another so as to better arrange big vessels traffic for instance when a wide body vessel is moving to its destination dock and a sailing vessel is waiting at a dock above the destination dock of that wide body one then the sailing vessel could start sailing only in the condition that it cannot pass the destination dock of that arriving wide body vessel until this wide body one arrives at its destination thus in this case the dock to dock travel time from the dock where the sailing vessel is moored to the destination dock of the wide body vessel is an important factor for scheduling the departure time of a vessel 2 2 1 dock line to determine the dock to dock travel time of a vessel it is necessary to determine the timestamp when a vessel passed by a dock not stop there as shown in fig 2 a a dock is a polyline along the waterway for consistency we define a dock line based on the centroid of a dock also see fig 4 a such a dock line crosses the channel so the time when a vessel passing by a dock can be regarded as the time when arriving at the dock line of this dock each dock has a dock line so in the following we directly call dock j s dock line as dock line j we call this time as the arrival time of a vessel at a dock line note that this arrival time is different from the arrival time of a vessel at a dock as discussed on section 2 1 2 2 2 point closest to dock line since a vessel s ais points are discrete intuitively such time can be determined via interpolation based on the timestamps of two ais points that are closest to the dock line one at each side of the dock line as points a and b shown in fig 4 a in application however there are two challenges 1 if a vessel had multiple trips i e went through a dock line back and forth more than once for the period covered by the given ais dataset then how to extract these two points for each trip 2 in a few cases two points that closest to a dock line are on the same side of the dock line then how to find alternative one on the other side of the dock line to increase the search efficiency like the method in section 2 1 we define a subset of one vessel s ais points which are close enough to a dock line this can be also achieved by using function buffer provided by gis package since some small vessels may have a speed up to 20 knots in the channel and time interval between two consecutive ais points are usually 1 min in this case the radius of this buffer is set to be 300 ft about 91 5 m note that in last section the buffer s radius is set to be 150 ft only for determining a vessel s destination dock the reason is that under the berthing and unberthing process vessels are moving with low speeds if such radius is too large lots of points under the normal navigation status could be included making the computational load unnecessarily large on the other hand under the normal navigation status vessels have much higher speeds in order to ensure to capture two points on each side of a dock line i e a and b as shown in fig 4 a the radius of this type of buffer needs to be large enough the ais points of vessel i covered by the buffer of dock line j form a subset denoted as π i j for simplicity t i j is still defined as the subset of timestamps of vessel i s ais points within the buffer of dock line j note that the ais points within π i j may be from several trips therefore it is important to separate the data of one trip from others given that a vessel visited the dock s in the channel from the ocean more than once within the time period covered by an ais dataset if moving inbound the time when a vessel passed through a dock line should be earlier less than its arrival time at its destination dock for this visit λ i k as this is the k th trip but later larger than the departure time of its last visit μ i k 1 on the other hand if moving outbound the time when a vessel passed through a dock line should be later larger than the departure time of this visit μ i k but earlier less than the arrival time of its next visit λ i k 1 note that λ i k and μ i k are different from the notations of the arrival and departure times of vessel i at dock j used in section 2 1 2 because its destination dock may vary in different visits to the channel however they can still be determined through the solution procedure described in section 2 1 2 by sorting the arrival time of vessel i for all of its destination docks this logic can be used to identify ais points a and b in fig 4 a as mentioned above for the convenience of using notations we denote λ i k and μ i k k 1 2 n i as the arrival and departure time to and from the destination dock for the k th visit of vessel i where n i refers to the total number of visits made by vessel i in the given ais dataset λ i k and μ i k are used to limit the search range let d i j t be the distance of the ais point of vessel i at timestamp t to dock line j note that for one vessel one timestamp uniquely determines one ais point such a distance can be obtained via function st distance in postgis which calculates the distance between two geometric objects if they are defined in the same spatial reference system therefore within a pool of ais points the point closest to dock line j in the k th visit can be identified iteratively using the following formulations for inbound and outbound trips respectively the entire iterative solution algorithm is given at the end of this section section 2 2 5 7 min d i j k min t i τ i j d i j t for outbound trips 8 s t μ i k t i λ i k 1 k 1 n i 9 λ i n i 1 max t i for inbound trips 10 s t μ i k 1 t i λ i k k 1 n i 11 μ i 0 min t i where min d i j k refers to vessel i s minimum distance to dock line j based on the ais points in subset π i j and considering the ais points from its k th visit only max t i and min t i refer to the earliest and latest timestamp of vessel i in the given dataset μ i k and λ i k refer to the arrival and departure times to and from the destination dock of vessel i in its k th visit where k 1 2 n i note that eqs 9 and 11 are just two boundary conditions not actually indicating the arrival or departure time for example for vessel i having two visits if dock line j is above the destination dock of the second visit but below the destination dock of the first visit we may not be able to find min d i j 2 for any t later than μ i 2 i e the departure time of the second visit of vessel i because condition 8 or 10 makes t i out of τ i j for the purpose of interpolation the first ais point needed as point a in fig 4 a is the one closest to the dock line of interest and its timestamp is denoted as dmin t i j k another i e point b in fig 4 a is the one last of or next to the first point it is not easy to get this last or next point before answering this question it is needed to determine the moving direction of a vessel based on its ais data 2 2 3 moving direction to answer the question of how to identify two points for interpolation first it is necessary to extract the ais points from a vessel s one direction movement such as inbound or outbound movement to achieve this purpose we can compare the course of an ais point c i t with the direction of dock line j denoted as θ j in this paper the direction of a dock line is defined as the angle from the true north n in the clockwise direction θ j is between 0 and 90 case i or between 270 and 360 case ii as shown in fig 4 b once the direction of a dock line is determined the course of each ais point can be used to determine the vessel s moving direction as shown in fig 4 c the rules are as follows without generality the direction to the right is regarded as outbound case i the point is from an outbound trip if θ j c i t 180 θ j or inbound otherwise case ii the point is from an outbound trip if c i t θ j or c i t θ j 180 or inbound otherwise note 1 c i t refers to the course of vessel i at time t and θ j is the direction of dock link of dock j 2 a course is regarded error if it is greater than 360 or less than 0 3 case i or ii depends on the direction of the dock line see fig 4 b vessel traffic in a channel is not as regular as highway traffic some small vessels such as tugs or fish boats may stop frequently and make a u turn anywhere also big ships make u turn at some specific locations however this paper aims to get the travel time information in a channel based on normal navigation so the travel times extracted from the vessels not under the normal navigation status such as making u turns will be marked as outliers and excluded in the analysis 2 2 4 next or last point as mentioned before two points are needed for interpolation the first one is the point from a given trip closest to dock line j and the second is the last or next point of the first one in terms of their timestamps as shown in fig 4 c given an outbound trip if the point closest to the dock line is on the left side of the dock line then its next point is needed otherwise it is needed to identify its last point the rule is similar for an inbound trip denote nl t i j k as the timestamp of this desired next or last point this section will discuss how to get nl t i j k for vessel i when it passed through dock line j in its k th visit in the channel as described above given the ais point which is closest to the dock line for vessel i to dock j s dock line first it is necessary to judge if this point is on the right or left side of a given dock line for this purpose we define φ i j t as the direction from the true north n to the line from the centroid of the dock line to this point suppose that the timestamp of this point is t as shown in fig 5 from fig 5 it is not difficult to see such rules for two cases respectively case i the point is on the right side of the dock line if θ j φ i j t 180 θ j or on the left side if φ i j t 180 θ j or φ i j t θ j case ii the point is on the right side of the dock line if φ i j t θ j or φ i j t θ j 180 or on the left side if θ j 180 φ i j t θ j note case i or ii depends on the direction of the dock line see fig 4 b if φ i j t θ j this point is exactly on the dock line i e min d i j k 0 therefore the timestamp of this point dmin t i j k is exactly the time when vessel i crossed the dock line of dock j otherwise go to the following formulations to find nl t i j k and then conduct the interpolation for brevity the ais point closest to the dock line is called the closest ais point or closest point formulations 12 27 were developed to determine nl t i j k considering 2 cases for an inbound or outbound trip respectively for brevity

to calculate the timestamp i e nl t i j k of the ais point last or next of the closest point once nl t i j k is found the distance from the corresponding ais point to the dock line can be easily found via the aforementioned gis function distance let nl d i j k denote such a distance then the time when vessel i crossed the dock line of dock j during its k th visit denoted as τ i j k can be determined through interpolation as eq 28 28 τ i j k nl d i j k dmin t i j k min d i j k based on eq 28 given visit k of vessel i the travel time between dock j and dock j 1 denoted as t t j j 1 i k

line of dock j during its k th visit 2 2 5 solution algorithm sections 2 2 2 2 2 4 discuss the theoretical method of how to determine the time when a vessel crossed a dock line these formulations can be solved iteratively in this section a more detailed solution procedure is given given vessel i based on the method described in section 2 1 its arrival and departure times can be determined as defined before μ i k and λ i k refer to the departure and arrival times of vessel i in its k th visit and μ i k 1 the departure time of vessel i in its k 1st visit we have μ i k 1 λ i k μ i k i e for vessel i the departure time of the k th trip should be later than the arrival time of this visit and the arrival time of the k th visit should be later than the departure time of the k 1st visit note that if k 1 μ i k 1 min t i i e the earliest timestamp of vessel i in the dataset or if k n i i e the last visit λ i k 1 max t i i e the latest timestamp of vessel i in the dataset μ i k and λ i k can be determined by using the procedure described in section 2 1 2 input ais dataset of vessel i and the geometric location of the dock line of dock j in the following we called dock line j for simplicity step 0 based on the solution algorithm procedure described in section 2 1 2 identify the departure and arrival time of each trip i e μ i k and λ i k k 1 2 n i step 1 define a buffer based on the geometric location of dock line j then define the ais point set π i j based on this buffer if π i j is empty it implies that vessel i never crossed dock line j stop otherwise determine the direction of dock line i e θ j see fig 4 b and go to step 2 step 2 extract ais points in π i j based on the condition μ i k t λ i k for k 1 2 n i given visit k if no data available go to step 2 6 otherwise go to step 2 1 step 2 1 the ais data between μ i k and λ i k could cover the navigation data in both inbound and outbound directions according to the research needs extract the data in the outbound or inbound direction only based on the condition described in section 2 2 3 step 2 2 based on the dataset extracted between μ i k and λ i k for one direction determine the ais point that is closest to the dock line i e the point with min d i j k and the corresponding timestamp dmin t i j k step 2 3 determine φ i j so as to determine if we need to find the next or last point of the ais point that is closest to the dock line for the purpose of interpolation step 2 4 determine the desired last or next point based on the formulations described in section 2 2 4 if such last or next point does not exist it indicates that vessel i never crossed dock line j when moving inbound or outbound between time μ i k and λ i k so go to step 2 6 otherwise go to step 2 5 step 2 5 based on these two points conduct the interpolation to determine the time when vessel i across dock line j i e τ i j k step 2 6 go to the k 1st trip and repeat steps 2 1 2 5 until all trips made by vessel i is studied stop remarks 1 in step 1 π i j can be obtained easily using gis function buffer which is available in most popular gis packages such as arcgis and postgregis 2 if k 1 μ i k 1 min t i i e the earliest timestamp of vessel i in the dataset or if k n i i e the last trip λ i k 1 max t i i e the latest timestamp of vessel i in the dataset 3 in case that no dmin t i j k is available based on formulations 7 11 it implies that vessel i did not cross dock link j in its k th visit in the following the ais data in the hsc from 11 months of 2017 were used to test the algorithms described above to determine the travel time as well as to analyze the properties of travel time in the hsc 3 application to hsc 3 1 review of ais data and testbed for testing the algorithms described above we downloaded the ais data from marinecadastre gov developed by the u s national oceanic and administration office and bureau of ocean energy management the data of 2017 excluding february were employed errors were reported when importing the data of february to the database for 11 months there are totally 102 187 704 records in the upper section of the hsc see fig 1 and each month has 9 289 791 records on average all data were imported to a postgresql database and the solution algorithms in sections 2 1 2 and 2 2 5 were coded in pl pgsql though the data covers the whole upper section of the hsc this paper particularly looks at the section above the beltway 8 bridge see fig 7 in this section of the hsc the first dock above the bridge is dock 48 and the last one is dock 107 the dock lines of docks 55 and 54 are in a branch of the hsc not in the main channel the ais data from the 11 months of 2017 shows that no tanker and cargo used these two docks this section of the channel is narrow from the beltway 8 bridge until dock 107 end of the channel there is a one way traffic restriction the restriction starts from the beltway 8 bridge and the first dock above the bridge is 48 according to this restriction there cannot be any meeting of ships greater than 106 feet 32 m below the bridge there is combined beam restrictions fig 6 shows three different restrictions on the width beam of vessels for different narrow sections of the hsc large ships such as tankers and cargos in this section of the hsc are significantly impacted by wide body vessels with beam of 106 ft or more i e 32 m a wide body vessel can occupy the whole width of the channel when moving in this section of the hsc however as mentioned above most tugs are not impacted as their drafts are small enough so that they can be moored anywhere near the bank therefore the algorithm described in section 2 1 2 may not well capture a tug s real destination as well as its arrival and departure times as it stops frequently in the channel and not necessarily at a dock for these reasons only big ships travel times were studied the big ships in this study are considered as those having draft greater than 16 feet 4 87 m in the hsc only two types of big ships are considered tankers and cargos the number of passenger ship can be neglectable fig 8 a reports the monthly distributions of different vessel types in the hsc recorded in 11 months of 2017 it is seen that except tugs tankers and cargos were the major vessels therefore the travel times of only tankers and cargos were studied in this paper by using the algorithm described in section 2 1 1 the trips made by tankers and cargos in the section above the bridge in each month except february of 2017 were investigated and the results were reported in fig 8 b it is seen that tankers play an important role in the hsc in some months of 2017 tankers made nearly 200 trips to the docks located above the bridge implying that on average there were over 5 tankers in each day moving in this section of the hsc 3 2 distribution of travel time traversal time based on the ais data of 11 months of 2017 we firstly calculated destination dock departure and arrival times of each tanker and cargo according to the algorithm in section 2 1 2 then based on the revealed trips the draft of each trip was determined from the raw ais dataset finally based on the revealed trips focusing on outbound trips only the procedure for inbound trips is the same i e trips heading to the gulf we calculated the travel time of each tanker and cargo respectively from its destination dock to the bridge see fig 7 based on the algorithm described in section 2 2 5 a big ship s starting process from the stationery state is time consuming for increasing its speed and changing the heading direction a u turn may be needed therefore another type of travel time traversal time was considered in this paper a vessel s traversal time from one dock line to another is the time spent by this vessel in moving from that dock line to another under its normal navigation status since only outbound trips were considered for convenience if vessel i started from dock j its traversal time was calculated from dock line j 3 j 4 48 respectively to the bridge note that as shown in fig 7 the next of dock line 56 is dock line 53 and dock line 48 is the last one above the bridge for simplicity these two types of travel times are called 1 travel time from the destination dock and 2 traversal time respectively in the following text for each dock or dock line a series of travel times or traversal times were calculated respectively due to the data error and some special navigation status e g u turn some travel time data are particularly large since we focus on the regular navigation status to avoid generating some bias results it is necessary to remove these large travel traversal time data note that unlike traffic in highway vessel navigation in a waterway is fully controlled by a pilot and the dispatch of a vessel follows the plan a record is regarded to be an outlier if it is less than the value of the first quartile minus the 1 5 times iqr or greater than the value of the third quartile plus the 1 5 times iqr where iqr interquartile range is the distance between the third and first quartiles of the data montgomery et al 2010 actually it is found that the number of outliers is quite small on average only 5 97 for the travel time dataset and 1 88 for the traversal time dataset are identified as outliers more travel time data were found to be outliers because a vessel may make a u turn when departing from the dock the data error is also more likely to occur when a vessel starts from the stationery state the information of travel time and traversal time in a narrow channel is very useful for helping better managing vessel traffic in a narrow channel for example the reliability of travel time for different type of vessels can be obtained the delay caused by wide body vessels can be estimated moreover such information can help build a vessel dispatch scheme so as to minimize the travel delay this paper however aims to study the properties of these two types of travel time only apparently the number of traversal time data is much larger than the number of travel time data for those dock lines close to the bridge as we only looked at outbound trips for the purpose of statistical analysis at one dock or dock line if the sample size the number of travel times or traversal times of tankers and cargos was less than 20 for travel time data or 100 for traversal time data this dock was skipped for analysis the statistical summary of the two types of travel times were reported in table a1 in appendix a at the end of this paper as expected a large amount of time is required in the starting process it is seen that the mean travel time from one dock to the bridge is much larger than the corresponding traversal time from the dock line of the same dock to the bridge to better understand the properties of these two types of travel time their distributions were estimated using two methods the kolmogorov smirnov k s and chi square goodness of fit tests via matlab respectively under two types of tests the p values under four most commonly used distributions gamma lognormal normal and weibull distributions were calculated respectively with or without outliers based on the p values reported by each test the number of datasets estimated to follow each type of distribution was reported in table 1 note that the default significance level is 0 05 if the p value of a test is no more than 0 05 the null hypothesis that the samples are from a desired distributed population can be rejected otherwise we cannot reject the hypothesis that the data follow a certain type of distribution from table 1 it is seen that 1 outliers have significant impact on type of distribution estimate 2 the results under two tests are close though the chi square test seems to be stricter and 3 few seem to be weibull distributed so in the following we focus on the first three types of distributions through monte carlo tests wang 2009 concluded that given the significance level of 0 05 the k s test seems to be more effective than the chi square test because the former exhibits smaller type i error and larger power except the case that the null hypothesis has a known mean therefore we just reported the p values of the k s tests in appendix a 1 other methods were also employed in the literature for example kang et al 2018 2019 employed the normal probability plot to check the normality of travel time data in the strait of singapore in the literature traversal times of vehicles in an uncongested highway section are sometimes assumed to be normally distributed lo et al 2006 shao et al 2006 for vessel traffic in the channel some studies also found that the traversal times are normally distributed xiao et al 2015 kang et al 2018 2019 however interestingly it is seen from table a1 that even though most travel times from destination docks to the bridge are normally distributed p values 0 05 most traversal times are not instead it is seen that the traversal time from each dock line to the bridge is more likely to follow a lognormal distribution p values 0 05 even excluding outliers note that for traversal time datasets on average 85 outliers are on the right tail it implies that the traversal times of different types and sizes of vessels may have different distributions this postulation will be studied in the next section as to the travel time from destination docks to the bridge since the time spent in starting process is large it entails that such time for starting process is similar across different types and sizes of ships 3 3 factors impacting traversal time to better understand why traversal time is not normally distributed we aimed to investigate which factors could impact the traversal time in the hsc the following 5 factors were considered a type of a vessel tanker or cargo b width of a vessel a vessel is wide body wb if its width is 32 m 106 ft or larger non wb otherwise such information was provided by the pilots of the hsc c draft of a vessel a vessel is in draft class 1 d1 if its draft is at most 9 m in draft class 3 d3 if its draft is more than 11 m and in draft class 2 d2 otherwise d time of day daytime if the time arriving at the bridge is later than 6 00 but earlier than 19 30 in may june july and august or later than 6 30 but earlier than 18 30 in march april september and october note that it is under daylight saving time or later than 7 30 but earlier than 17 00 in january november and december no ais data in february nighttime otherwise e month january march april december no ais data in february note that among these 5 factors two are temporal factors time of day and month two are related with vessel itself type and width and one is related with both vessel and voyage draft to investigate the impacts of these factors a series of the analysis of variance anova were conducted note that anova requires the sample under each category to be normally distributed therefore the k s test was first used to test the normality of the samples in the category of each factor for example the traversal time of wide body vessels tankers and cargos from dock line 59 to the bridge was found not normally distributed so the anova for the factor of vessel width could not be conducted for this dataset traversal time from dock line 59 under each factor the sample size varies for example there were 819 wide body tankers but only 340 non wide body tankers for all 11 months of 2017 therefore two way anova with unequal sample size considering one temporal factor and one vessel feature were used in matlab and the p value in each test was reported in table a2 in appendix a the p values show that both temporal factors time of day and month did not have significant impact on traversal time from each dock line to the bridge this finding is somewhat different from our experience on highway traffic which have peak hours and off peak hours and link travel time distributions are usually time dependent wu 2013 the reason probably is that the traffic of big vessels in a narrow and busy channel such as the hsc is fully monitored by the port authority and big vessels are fully controlled by pilots assigned by the port authority on the other hand the factors of vessel features especially width and draft were found to significantly impact the traversal time from all dock lines and vessel type had significant impact on the traversal time from most dock lines therefore we conclude that the traversal time is largely impacted by vessel features such as its width draft and type to better understand such impact the comparison across different vessel features were further investigated first the traversal times of wide body and large draft draft class 3 denoted as wb d3 tankers and cargos were compared with those of non wide body and small draft draft class 1 denoted as nwb d1 ones from each dock line if the sample size was large enough it was found that from all dock lines the former is always greater than the latter i e larger ships ran slower fig 9 a reports the distribution of the mean and median differences between wb d3 and nwb d1 ships respectively for example from the same dock line to the bridge nearly 43 of wb d3 cargos saw the mean traversal time 10 longer than nwb d1 cargos while almost 28 of wb d3 tankers found the mean travel time 15 longer than nwb d1 tankers such difference is significant further fig 9 a also shows that the difference between big and small tankers is larger than the difference between large and small cargos then the difference between tankers and cargos were investigated when they were both wb d3 or nwb d1 the distribution of the mean and median differences was reported in fig 9 b respectively for example if both were big ships wb d3 as to mean traversal time nearly 20 of tankers saw 8 longer than cargos however if both were small nwb d1 over 50 of tankers saw only 2 more than cargos it well implies that big tankers moved slower than big cargos but the difference between small tankers and cargos were not clear 3 4 spatial correlation in a highway network if one link suffers from traffic congestions its adjacent upstream 2 2 in the hsc the upstream direction refers to the direction from the gulf of mexico to the port of houston link is very likely to be congested too this is called spatial correlation to the best knowledge of the authors such spatial correction was not studied for vessel traffic in waterways for narrow and busy channels such correlation is likely to impact travel time of vessels significantly the revealed traversal times from one dock lines to another opens the door for answering this question in last section it was already found that vessel features have significant impact on traversal times for this reason the spatial correlation was studied in different categories in terms of vessel type width and draft such as wb d3 tankers or cargos nwb d1 tankers or cargos etc considering the sample size as at least 100 samples were preferred from one dock line we picked a section of the channel from dock line 70 to the bridge so totally 21 links were covered note that the next of dock line 56 is dock line 53 for one vessel its traversal time from one dock line to the next dock line was calculated as link traversal times see eq 29 as we already calculated the traversal time from one dock line to the bridge it would be easy to get such link traversal time of one vessel one observation of a series of link traversal times came from one vessel when it passed through the channel from dock line 70 to the bridge since wide body tankers cargos in draft class 1 wb d1 and non wide body tankers cars in draft class 3 nwb d3 were unusual small sample size only 4 categories of vessels were considered here wb d3 wb d2 nwb d2 nwb d1 for tankers and cargos respectively so 8 correlation coefficient matrixes were calculated respectively 4 types of tankers and cargos respectively each matrix has a size of 20 20 as there are 21 links fig 10 summarizes such correlation coefficient matrixes based on the distance between two links two links are adjacent links if they are just separated by 1 dock line and since there are totally 21 dock lines the farthest two links are separated by 20 dock lines from fig 10 we can clearly see that the correlation coefficient between two adjacent links are close to 1 in most cases only two cases of cargos where the coefficient is below 0 7 which can be regarded as outliers also when two links are separated by more dock lines the correlation becomes weaker however even if two links are separated by 10 dock lines the correlation coefficients are still about 0 5 these findings well indicate that the link traversal time between links in the hsc are highly positively correlated 4 discussion and conclusions this paper proposes a novel ais data based model and the corresponding algorithms to estimate the travel time of vessels between any two points in narrow and busy channel the model has two components 1 to determine the destination dock of a vessel as well as its arrival and departure times from this dock and 2 to determine the timestamp when a vessel passed a landmark of interest in the channel this model can help us easily determine the travel time of a vessel from one point to another in the channel including the travel time from its destination dock to a specific landmark or vice versa in the channel based on the proposed model this paper employed the ais data of 11 months in 2017 collected in the hsc to study the property of travel times of tankers and cargos focusing on the section of channel above the beltway 8 bridge this narrow section has lots of docks making traffic condition in this section critical considering outbound trips only two types of travel times were defined 1 the travel time from a vessel s destination dock to the bridge starting from the stationery state and 2 the traversal time from one dock line to the bridge when a vessel went through this distance under the normal navigation status apparently from the same dock the travel time is much longer than the traversal time as the starting process is time consuming the findings of travel time properties were summarized as follows f if considering all tankers and cargos together with various size and draft the traversal time from a dock line to the bridge is likely to be lognormally distributed not normally distributed on the other hand in most cases the travel time from a destination dock to the bridge is normally distributed g time of day daytime or nighttime and month have insignificant impact on the distribution of traversal time from each dock line to the bridge on the other hand vessel width draft and vessel types were found have significant impact especially the width and draft h larger ships moved slower and the difference is not small on average the mean traversal time of wide body wb 32 m tankers in draft class 3 d3 11 m was 12 longer than that of non wide body nwb tankers in draft class 1 d1 9 m while for cargos such difference was a little bit smaller 9 on average on the other hand the difference on median traversal time was even larger wb d3 tankers experienced averagely 13 longer median traversal time than nwb d1 tankers and while for cargos such difference was also about 9 on average i tankers generally moved slower than cargos especially for larger ships on average the mean traversal time of wb d3 tankers was 4 larger than wb d3 cargos while only 2 more if comparing between nwb d1 tankers with nwb d1 cargos on the other hand wb d3 tankers saw averagely 5 longer median traversal time than wb d3 cargos but the median traversal times between nwb d1 tankers and cargos were very close only 1 more on average j the traversal times between two adjacent links in the hsc were significantly positively correlated the correlation coefficient is close to 1 implying if one link suffers from congestion the upstream adjacent link is very likely to see congestion too such correlation decreases when one link is farther away from another but even if two links are separated by 10 dock lines the correlation coefficient is still about 0 5 these findings are well consistent with the real experience it shows that the proposed models and solution algorithms produce reasonable travel time estimates by building an inventory of travel times between any two points in the channel we will know the travel time distributions and it opens the door for many studies including the estimate of the vessel delay caused by congestion in the channel the optimization of dispatching vessels in the channel etc the research team has started the research on these topics even if the aforementioned models and solution algorithms were developed based on the research needs of the hsc they can be easily applied to any other ship channels statement of author contributions xing wu developed the models for estimating the arrival and departure times of vessels at their destination docks cleaned

21965,this paper proposes an ais data based model to accurately estimate vessels travel time and its distribution between any two points in a narrow channel it is crucial to know the travel time plus its distribution between some critical points for traffic control the model has two components 1 to identify a vessel s destination dock and its arrival and departure times the key is how to separate a vessel s trips and 2 to estimate a vessel s travel time from its destination dock or a specific point to another specific point or vice versa travel time between two points is called traversal time the proposed algorithms were then applied to the houston ship channel hsc with the ais data of 11 months in 2017 focusing on the outbound trips in the section above the beltway 8 bridge through the travel times of cargos and tankers from their destination docks to a point are likely to be normally distributed their traversal times between two points are more likely to be lognormally distributed the traversal time distribution is significantly impacted by vessel width draft and type but independent from time of day and month the adjacent link traversal times are also highly positively correlated keywords travel time travel time distribution ais data houston ship channel 1 introduction the port of houston is the second busiest seaports in the united states in terms of total tonnage according to the data of 2013 aapa 2015 about 200 private and public industrial terminals stretch along the 52 mile long houston ship channel hsc and each year more than 8200 vessels and 215 000 barges carries more than 247 million tons of cargo through the hsc port of houston 2019 the hsc plays a critical role in supporting texas energy and petrochemical industries fig 1 shows the map of the hsc broadly speaking it can be divided into two sections the lower one goes through galveston ship channel and is constraint by galveston sea buoys and the upper one is constraint by actual riverbanks san jacinto river and buffalo bayou the hsc is about 45 ft 14 m deep so it can accommodate big ships the hsc is narrow especially the upper section near houston as the inside channel marked in fig 1 this paper only focuses on this upper section with so many vessels moving through the channel every day many vessels suffer from serious delays caused by various reasons one of the important reasons comes from big ships as they could block the entire channel when moving through some narrow sections to better estimate the delay and further to develop a solution scheme to optimize the vessel flows in the hsc it is firstly necessary to understand the property of travel time of vessels in different types and sizes currently the knowledge of travel time of vessels in the channel is obtained largely based on pilots experience and work reports such data mainly come from reports this paper summarizes a preliminary study in the project on how to optimize the traffic flow in the hsc with a focus on how to accurately estimate the travel time of vessels from one specific location to another such specific points indicate specific sections for example the beltway 8 bridge in the hsc is an important landmark in the section of the channel above the bridge the channel can only hold one big ship with a beam of 106 ft 32 m or more and the opposing traffic for big ships has to be interrupted even it is a preliminary study 3 problems are challengeable 1 for one vessel how to separate the ais data of one trip from others 2 how to tell a vessel s arrival and departure times for different trips based on all ais points close to the destination dock and 3 how to precisely estimate a vessel s arrival time at any point in a channel by solving these questions the travel time of a vessel in a channel between two points can be found then another interesting question is how are vessels travel times distributed and which factors impact the travel time distributions note that though this paper only focuses on big ships cargos and tankers in the hsc the proposed method can be applied to any big ship in inland narrow channels with docks an inland narrow channel usually is made by dredging a natural riverbed to a certain depth to accommodate big ships therefore the navigation routes of big ships are strictly constrained within a channel including the routes connected to docks such a constraint makes it possible to answer the above questions simply based on the navigation data of vessels for this reason the proposed method cannot be applied to small vessels such as tugs because they can be moored anywhere near the bank since 2002 new ships and all sea going vessels that have 300 gross tons or more as well as all passenger vessels are required to equip an automatic identification system ais on board the ais transmits the sailing status information between vessels and from vessels to shore or vice versa the ais data contains the detailed and consecutive temporal and spatial information of a vessel vessel id name width length type as well as real maneuvering behavior of a vessel such as longitude latitude speed course heading draft etc at every 1 min of a vessel for this reason recently ais data are widely used in waterway transportation research including the risk analysis of vessel collisions vessel travel behavior modeling estimate of vessel trajectory etc the ais data provide us a good and reliable source of data to study the travel time of vessels in the channel for example they can be used to estimate the delay suffered by vessels the delay here is referred to the waiting time of vessels due to various reasons such as navigation restrictions beam width restrictions of vessels etc in the channel recently the application of ais data mainly focuses on two directions risk analysis of navigation and vessels travel behavior analysis to analyze the risk of vessel collision and or groundings many studies were based on the concept of ship domain horteborn et al 2019 which is a surrounding effective waters a ship navigator want to keep clear of other vessels or fixed objectives goodwin 1975 through the analysis of ais data researchers studied the frequency of a vessel s ship domain incursion where the ship domain was defined in various shapes e g see montewka et al 2010 qu et al 2011 weng et al 2014 and wu et al 2016 other ais data based methods were also proposed for example mou et al 2010 developed ais data based linear regression models to evaluate the risk of vessel collisions off the port of rotterdam based on two indicators closest point of approach cpa and time to closest point of approach tcpa between two vessels zaman et al 2014 proposed an ais data based fuzzy fmea model to evaluate the risk of vessel collisions in the malacca strait and huang et al 2019 proposed ais data based crossing line and monte carlo methods to assess the risk of groundings in kaohsiung harbor the former aims to assess the ship grounding probability and the latter is used to simulate ship trajectory so as to evaluate the grounding frequency since they provide the detailed information of vessel status continuously ais data become an important source to investigate vessels travel behavior in critical sections of the channels in order to better understand the capacity of the channel 1 1 the capacity of a section of channel refers to the number of vessels able to go through the section of a channel in the unit time this is the maximum traffic volume considering weather conditions vessel size vessel s behavior speed safe distance and so on liu et al 2016 as well as to more efficiently arrange vessel traffic in the channel xiao et al 2015 investigated the travel behavior of vessels including the distributions of vessel speeds courses and arrival time intervals at two spots one near the port of rotterdam and another near shanghai based on ais data wu et al 2018 looked at how tankers and cargos pass through the hotspots in the sabine neches waterways snww identified in their previous study wu et al 2016 interestingly they found that different from highway traffic the mean travel time of vessels seems to be independent of the traffic density such independence was also found at the entrance of the galveston ship channel roy and wu 2019 kang et al 2018 also studied the relationship between mean travel time of vessels and traffic density in 15 legs in the singapore strait however they found that the travel time is correlated with density the difference between two studies may be from vessel volumes the singapore strait sees much more vessel volumes than the snww and galveston ship channel further kang et al 2019 investigated how ships pass through an l shaped channel in the singapore strait focusing on ships acceleration and deceleration pattern zhou et al 2019 proposed an ais data based method to classify ships through clustering their travel behavior the amount of ais data is huge unavoidably there exists outliers and missing data how to efficiently remove outliers and make up missing data is a big challenge various methods were proposed zhang et al 2018 a spline model to reconstruct vessels trajectories this model was shown to be able to fit any types of trajectories even with circles and clearly capture the navigation behavior of vessels through trajectory construction outliers can be identified and missing data can be made up kang et al 2019 proposed a series of algorithms to check the longitude and latitude speed and course wu et al 2016 2018 on the other hand employed statistical method and spatial relation functions in geographic information system gis packages to remove outliers estimating travel time at highway and roadways has been widely studied in the literature the california department of transportation caltrans suggested that travel time can provide information in various forms to assist managers traffic engineers planners freeway users and researchers choe et al 2002 a number of studies attempted to develop algorithms for estimating travel time at highways using advanced systems such as video image processing automatic vehicle identification cellular phone tracking and probe vehicles for example turner 1996 jiyoun et al 2008 and el esawey et al 2011 estimated travel time on a road network by using travel time relationships with neighbor links when the sample data set is small nie et al 2012 estimated each road segment s travel time distribution based on the data from loop detectors and electric toll records for the chicago metropolitan road network and wang et al 2014 estimated travel time of any path in a city using map data sources and gps trajectories such models were used for applications such as traffic monitoring chawla et al 2012 taxi dispatching yuan et al 2013 and travel time reliability analysis nie et al 2012 wu and nie 2013 wu 2013 travel time data were also used for various applications in waterway studies using the houston pilot transit data rahimikelarijani et al 2018 and kaneria et al 2019 used travel times to determine the optimal closure scenario in the hsc due to the demolition and re construction of the beltway 8 bridge for minimizing vessel waiting time for estimating travel time of ships on inland waterways asamer and prandtstetter 2014 developed two methods based on historical and currently observed velocities from the recorded ship trajectories for estimating ship travel times in an inland waterway dijoseph and mitchell 2015 proposed a method to establish baseline travel time statistics using archived ais position in an inland river system and riley et al 2015 used ais data and river stage data for analyzing the relationship between vessel transit times and water levels and for measuring vessel travel times over two years but none of these above mentioned studies is about trip separation and arrival time estimation at any point in a channel e g the study of dijoseph and mitchell 2015 is based on the given ais positions in the channel an ais dataset may cover a long time period in which a vessel could visit the channel of interest more than once to estimate vessels travel time based on ais data it is important to identify different trips of a vessel this study aims to build a more general method to determine the travel time of vessels in a channel covering any segment considering different vessel types and navigation status such as the travel time from the departure or the travel time under normal navigation status it is the major methodological contribution of this paper by building the travel time inventory the travel time reliability of different types of vessels can be obtained and the delay can be quantitatively estimated this opens the door for optimizing the traffic flow of vessels in a narrow and busy channel such as the closure and vessel scheduling in the hsc in order to schedule a closure e g due to dredging tasks or construction at a specific location of a waterway the vessel traffic service vts needs to consider vessel travel time to the closed section of the channel to determine the best time for closure the best closure time minimizes the total waiting time of all arrival and sailing vessels affected by the closure although pilots and coast guard constantly work with real time ais data no historical estimations are integrated with their system to optimize the operation another application is vessel scheduling pilots need to schedule and order vessels in the channel the complexity of the scheduling arises from navigation restrictions imposed on vessels based on their sizes for example vessels with beam width greater that 106 ft 32m are one way traffic restricted above the beltway 8 bridge or liquefied petroleum gas lpg tankers with length greater than 560 ft 171 m are daylight restricted in the hsc such limitations increase the congestion in the channel and potentially generate delays for other vessels optimizing navigation at the channel considering different navigation rules directly needs travel time estimation the reminder of this article is organized as follows section 2 gives the methodological framework used to estimate travel time of vessels in the channel section 3 describes the numerical examples where the property of travel time of big ships such as tankers and cargos in the hsc was investigated and section 4 concludes the paper 2 methodology 2 1 arrival and departure time at destination dock as to those questions mentioned at the beginning this section aims to answer the first two 1 to determine the destination dock of a big ship and 2 to determine the arrival and departure times of a big ship at its destination dock 2 1 1 model formulation to investigate the travel time inventory of vessels in a busy narrow channel it is necessary to find the destination docks of a vessel as well as its arrival time at this dock and departure time from this dock because the speeds of a vessel near its destination dock will be very different from those when a vessel is in normal navigation status also to build the travel time inventory it is necessary to find the destination dock of a vessel as its destination and origin in the dataset on vessel information the destination of this vessel is reported however such destination only refers to the destination port a port usually has many docks as shown in fig 2 a there are totally 81 docks along the hsc given a narrow channel like the hsc which have a large number of big ships such as tankers and cargos the water depth near docks are much larger than the depth near the bank without dock therefore for a big ship if its ais points are close to one dock as shown in fig 2 it implies that this dock is the destination dock of this ship given a set of ais data for one vessel if it had only one destination dock and visited this destination dock only once then it would be easy to determine this vessel s destination dock and the corresponding arrival and departure times respectively we can get the information by simply checking all of this vessel s ais data which are close to docks e g within the buffer of this dock see fig 2 b however a given ais dataset usually covers the whole month it is possible that a vessel may visit more than one destination dock and or visit a dock more than once for this reason it is necessary to develop a general algorithm to identify the destination dock and the arrival and departure times respectively when applying to the ais data of the hsc the buffer radius is 150 ft 46 m to determine the destination dock of a vessel only the ais data inside the buffer are analyzed to study the arrival and departure time at the destination dock by doing this the ais data with spatial error are excluded for further analysis consider an inland waterway transportation system with a series of docks j 1 2 n d and vessels i 1 2 n v where n d and n v refer to the numbers of unique docks and vessels in this system respectively then denote δ i j 1 if vessel i was moored at dock j and δ i j 0 otherwise for vessel i an ais point contains the following information at one timestamp t longitude latitude speed over ground sog and course over ground cog in the following text speed and course are used referring to sog and cog respectively these types of information for vessel i are denoted as x i t y i t s i t and c i t respectively given a timestamp the ais point of a vessel can be uniquely identified it implies that given t i x i t y i t s i t and c i t can be identified moreover the timestamp series of two different vessels are not the same for example for one vessel the timestamp series are 2018 08 01 00 01 00 2018 08 01 00 02 02 2018 08 01 00 03 04 while another one s timestamp series can be 2018 08 01 00 01 15 2018 08 01 00 02 16 2018 08 01 00 03 14 such inconsistency of timestamps increases the difficulty of ais data analysis on the other hand if δ i j 1 let λ i j k and μ i j k be the arrival and departure times of vessel i at dock j in its k th visit respectively where j 1 2 n i j and n i j refers to the number of visits of vessel i to dock j to get λ i j k and τ i j k we need to define a subset of the ais points of vessel i the ais points in this subset should be close enough to the dock implying the moored status or the status close to the moored status such a subset can be obtained through a gis tool such as function buffer available in popular gis packages such as arcgis and postgis the purpose of using a buffer is to filter data for the next step analysis so as to avoid scanning the entire dataset as aforementioned the buffer radius is set to be 150 ft about 46 m based on the geometric property of the hsc as shown in fig 2 b vessel i s ais points within the buffer of dock j form the aforementioned subset denoted as γ i j to reduce the complexity of notations in the following text for vessel i we simply use s i t γ i j or c i t γ i j to indicate the speed or the course of an ais point that is inside the buffer of dock j as to timestamps we denote τ i j as the subset of vessel i s timestamps at which the ais points are inside the buffer of dock j and t i j as the complimentary of τ i j i e the subset of vessel i s timestamps at which the ais points are outside the buffer of dock j please refer to appendix b at the end of the paper for the full list of notations then the arrival and departure times of vessel i at dock j from its k th visit i e λ i j k and μ i j k can be determined based on the following two formulations respectively note that at the arrival or departure time a vessel s speed sog is 0 as shown in conditions 2 and 4 respectively 1 λ i j k min t i μ i j k 1 t i τ i j t i 2 s t s i t 0 s i t γ i j k 2 n i j 3 μ i j k max t i ζ i j k t i τ i j t i 4 s t s i t 0 s i t γ i j 5 ζ i j k min t i λ i j k t i t i j t i k 1 n i j where t i is the timestamp of vessel i associated with an ais point and ζ i j k in condition 5 is an auxiliary variable referring to the earliest timestamp after vessel i left the buffer of dock j after its k th visit to dock j to solve λ i j k and μ i j k respectively the following boundary conditions are needed 6 λ i j 1 min t i τ i j t i where s i t 0 s i t γ i j μ i j n i j max t i τ i j t i where s i t 0 s i t γ i j n i j 1 i f t i i n λ i j 1 t i μ i j n i j we have t i t i j where λ i j 1 and μ i j n i j refer to the arrival time of the first visit k 1 and the departure time of the last visit k n i j respectively n i j is the number of visits made by vessel i at dock j and t i refers to a timestamp associated with an ais point of vessel i the last boundary condition implies that for vessel i there is only one visit i e n i j 1 if no ais point between the arrival time of its first visit and the departure time of its last visit is outside the buffer of dock j this idea of determining the arrival and departure times is also illustrated in fig 3 as shown in formulations 1 6 the arrival time is regarded as the earliest time when a vessel s speed is 0 after it enters the buffer of a dock and the departure time is regarded as the latest time when its speed is 0 before leaving the buffer note that the berthing and un berthing process for a big ship to a dock is complicated however since the focus of this paper is an inland channel made by dredging the riverbed to a certain depth to accommodate big ships a big ship s route is strictly limited within the channel of a waterway river therefore when a big ship is found close to a dock it can be regarded in the process of berthing or unberthing moreover the constraints on speed and timestamp can exclude the error data given a large data set e g 11 months ais data were considered in this paper the impact of such error could be marginal see the details in section 3 2 1 2 solution algorithm to solve formations 1 6 one key is to separate trips made by vessel i at dock j i e determining k it can be solved through an iterative procedure after determining the arrival and departure times of the first visit k 1 starting from k 2 the arrival time of the k t h visit must be the earliest time with speed of 0 i e s i t 0 where t λ i j k larger than the departure time of the k 1 t h visit once the arrival time of the k th visit i e λ i j k is determined the trip of the k th visit is thus separated by repeating this procedure the trip of each visit can be separated until we cannot find an arrival time later than the departure time of the last visit the following gives the details of this iterative algorithm based on vessel i s ais data input ais dataset of vessel i and the geometric location of dock j step 1 for dock j define a buffer then based on the ais dataset of vessel i employ gis function buffer to define a set of ais data γ i j step 2 based on γ i j find λ i j 1 μ i j n i j respectively if λ i j 1 and or μ i j n i j cannot be found it implies that vessel i may not be moored at dock j it may just pass by with a small distance to the dock it could happen to small vessels such as tugs then let δ i j 0 and go to vessel i 1 to restart this procedure otherwise let δ i j 1 and go to step 3 step 3 if n i j 1 based on the last condition of eq 6 implying that there is only one visit let μ i j 1 μ i j n i j and then record the λ i j 1 and μ i j 1 respectively go to the next vessel i 1 and restart otherwise if n i j 1 go to step 4 step 4 at k 1 determine ζ i j k according to eq 5 then based on ζ i j k determine departure time μ i j k according to formations 3 4 go to step 5 step 5 at k k 1 solve arrival time λ i j k based on μ i j k 1 according to formulations 1 2 and then determine ζ i j k based on ζ i j k determine departure time μ i j k repeat this step until μ i j k μ i j n i j for many large ships such as tankers and cargos the number of visits at one dock in a month is no more than 1 and only a few have 2 visits but for small vessels such as tugs or harbor vessels the number of visits in a month can be more than 10 actually it is found that the aforementioned method can accurately determine the arrival and departure times of big ships see the next section on numerical experiments however for small vessels some errors exist because as mentioned before these small vessels can be moored near any bank due to their small drafts in this paper only big ships are focused on 2 2 timestamp of passing by a dock now we aim to answer the last question how to precisely estimate a vessel s arrival time at any point in a channel the model and algorithm developed in the following can be applied to any point in a channel as mentioned in the first section in a narrow channel where many docks are located a big vessel s movement can affect the navigation of many others which need to leave from these docks therefore it is important to know the vessels travel time from one dock to another so as to better arrange big vessels traffic for instance when a wide body vessel is moving to its destination dock and a sailing vessel is waiting at a dock above the destination dock of that wide body one then the sailing vessel could start sailing only in the condition that it cannot pass the destination dock of that arriving wide body vessel until this wide body one arrives at its destination thus in this case the dock to dock travel time from the dock where the sailing vessel is moored to the destination dock of the wide body vessel is an important factor for scheduling the departure time of a vessel 2 2 1 dock line to determine the dock to dock travel time of a vessel it is necessary to determine the timestamp when a vessel passed by a dock not stop there as shown in fig 2 a a dock is a polyline along the waterway for consistency we define a dock line based on the centroid of a dock also see fig 4 a such a dock line crosses the channel so the time when a vessel passing by a dock can be regarded as the time when arriving at the dock line of this dock each dock has a dock line so in the following we directly call dock j s dock line as dock line j we call this time as the arrival time of a vessel at a dock line note that this arrival time is different from the arrival time of a vessel at a dock as discussed on section 2 1 2 2 2 point closest to dock line since a vessel s ais points are discrete intuitively such time can be determined via interpolation based on the timestamps of two ais points that are closest to the dock line one at each side of the dock line as points a and b shown in fig 4 a in application however there are two challenges 1 if a vessel had multiple trips i e went through a dock line back and forth more than once for the period covered by the given ais dataset then how to extract these two points for each trip 2 in a few cases two points that closest to a dock line are on the same side of the dock line then how to find alternative one on the other side of the dock line to increase the search efficiency like the method in section 2 1 we define a subset of one vessel s ais points which are close enough to a dock line this can be also achieved by using function buffer provided by gis package since some small vessels may have a speed up to 20 knots in the channel and time interval between two consecutive ais points are usually 1 min in this case the radius of this buffer is set to be 300 ft about 91 5 m note that in last section the buffer s radius is set to be 150 ft only for determining a vessel s destination dock the reason is that under the berthing and unberthing process vessels are moving with low speeds if such radius is too large lots of points under the normal navigation status could be included making the computational load unnecessarily large on the other hand under the normal navigation status vessels have much higher speeds in order to ensure to capture two points on each side of a dock line i e a and b as shown in fig 4 a the radius of this type of buffer needs to be large enough the ais points of vessel i covered by the buffer of dock line j form a subset denoted as π i j for simplicity t i j is still defined as the subset of timestamps of vessel i s ais points within the buffer of dock line j note that the ais points within π i j may be from several trips therefore it is important to separate the data of one trip from others given that a vessel visited the dock s in the channel from the ocean more than once within the time period covered by an ais dataset if moving inbound the time when a vessel passed through a dock line should be earlier less than its arrival time at its destination dock for this visit λ i k as this is the k th trip but later larger than the departure time of its last visit μ i k 1 on the other hand if moving outbound the time when a vessel passed through a dock line should be later larger than the departure time of this visit μ i k but earlier less than the arrival time of its next visit λ i k 1 note that λ i k and μ i k are different from the notations of the arrival and departure times of vessel i at dock j used in section 2 1 2 because its destination dock may vary in different visits to the channel however they can still be determined through the solution procedure described in section 2 1 2 by sorting the arrival time of vessel i for all of its destination docks this logic can be used to identify ais points a and b in fig 4 a as mentioned above for the convenience of using notations we denote λ i k and μ i k k 1 2 n i as the arrival and departure time to and from the destination dock for the k th visit of vessel i where n i refers to the total number of visits made by vessel i in the given ais dataset λ i k and μ i k are used to limit the search range let d i j t be the distance of the ais point of vessel i at timestamp t to dock line j note that for one vessel one timestamp uniquely determines one ais point such a distance can be obtained via function st distance in postgis which calculates the distance between two geometric objects if they are defined in the same spatial reference system therefore within a pool of ais points the point closest to dock line j in the k th visit can be identified iteratively using the following formulations for inbound and outbound trips respectively the entire iterative solution algorithm is given at the end of this section section 2 2 5 7 min d i j k min t i τ i j d i j t for outbound trips 8 s t μ i k t i λ i k 1 k 1 n i 9 λ i n i 1 max t i for inbound trips 10 s t μ i k 1 t i λ i k k 1 n i 11 μ i 0 min t i where min d i j k refers to vessel i s minimum distance to dock line j based on the ais points in subset π i j and considering the ais points from its k th visit only max t i and min t i refer to the earliest and latest timestamp of vessel i in the given dataset μ i k and λ i k refer to the arrival and departure times to and from the destination dock of vessel i in its k th visit where k 1 2 n i note that eqs 9 and 11 are just two boundary conditions not actually indicating the arrival or departure time for example for vessel i having two visits if dock line j is above the destination dock of the second visit but below the destination dock of the first visit we may not be able to find min d i j 2 for any t later than μ i 2 i e the departure time of the second visit of vessel i because condition 8 or 10 makes t i out of τ i j for the purpose of interpolation the first ais point needed as point a in fig 4 a is the one closest to the dock line of interest and its timestamp is denoted as dmin t i j k another i e point b in fig 4 a is the one last of or next to the first point it is not easy to get this last or next point before answering this question it is needed to determine the moving direction of a vessel based on its ais data 2 2 3 moving direction to answer the question of how to identify two points for interpolation first it is necessary to extract the ais points from a vessel s one direction movement such as inbound or outbound movement to achieve this purpose we can compare the course of an ais point c i t with the direction of dock line j denoted as θ j in this paper the direction of a dock line is defined as the angle from the true north n in the clockwise direction θ j is between 0 and 90 case i or between 270 and 360 case ii as shown in fig 4 b once the direction of a dock line is determined the course of each ais point can be used to determine the vessel s moving direction as shown in fig 4 c the rules are as follows without generality the direction to the right is regarded as outbound case i the point is from an outbound trip if θ j c i t 180 θ j or inbound otherwise case ii the point is from an outbound trip if c i t θ j or c i t θ j 180 or inbound otherwise note 1 c i t refers to the course of vessel i at time t and θ j is the direction of dock link of dock j 2 a course is regarded error if it is greater than 360 or less than 0 3 case i or ii depends on the direction of the dock line see fig 4 b vessel traffic in a channel is not as regular as highway traffic some small vessels such as tugs or fish boats may stop frequently and make a u turn anywhere also big ships make u turn at some specific locations however this paper aims to get the travel time information in a channel based on normal navigation so the travel times extracted from the vessels not under the normal navigation status such as making u turns will be marked as outliers and excluded in the analysis 2 2 4 next or last point as mentioned before two points are needed for interpolation the first one is the point from a given trip closest to dock line j and the second is the last or next point of the first one in terms of their timestamps as shown in fig 4 c given an outbound trip if the point closest to the dock line is on the left side of the dock line then its next point is needed otherwise it is needed to identify its last point the rule is similar for an inbound trip denote nl t i j k as the timestamp of this desired next or last point this section will discuss how to get nl t i j k for vessel i when it passed through dock line j in its k th visit in the channel as described above given the ais point which is closest to the dock line for vessel i to dock j s dock line first it is necessary to judge if this point is on the right or left side of a given dock line for this purpose we define φ i j t as the direction from the true north n to the line from the centroid of the dock line to this point suppose that the timestamp of this point is t as shown in fig 5 from fig 5 it is not difficult to see such rules for two cases respectively case i the point is on the right side of the dock line if θ j φ i j t 180 θ j or on the left side if φ i j t 180 θ j or φ i j t θ j case ii the point is on the right side of the dock line if φ i j t θ j or φ i j t θ j 180 or on the left side if θ j 180 φ i j t θ j note case i or ii depends on the direction of the dock line see fig 4 b if φ i j t θ j this point is exactly on the dock line i e min d i j k 0 therefore the timestamp of this point dmin t i j k is exactly the time when vessel i crossed the dock line of dock j otherwise go to the following formulations to find nl t i j k and then conduct the interpolation for brevity the ais point closest to the dock line is called the closest ais point or closest point formulations 12 27 were developed to determine nl t i j k considering 2 cases for an inbound or outbound trip respectively for brevity the scenarios that the closest point is on the right or left side of the dock line are put together formulations 12a 14a 15 16a 18a 19 20a 22a 23 and 24a 26a 27 are for the scenario that the closest point is on the right side of the dock line and formulations 12b 14b 15 16b 18b 19 20b 22b 23 and 24b 26b 27 are for the scenario of the closest point on the left side for instance in the case of outbound trips if the closest point is on the right side of the dock line we aim to find its last point which must be on the left side of this dock line and its timestamp must be the latest i e largest timestamp in all of this vessel s timestamps earlier than the timestamp of the closest point i e nl t i j k dmin t i j k on the other hand if the closet point is on the left side of the dock line we aim to find its next point which must be on the right side of this dock line and its timestamp must be the earliest i e smallest timestamp among all of this vessel s timestamps later than the timestamp of the closest point i e nl t i j k dmin t i j k conditions 14a 14b 18a 18b 22a 22b and 26a 26b indicate where the closest ais point is located on the right or left side of the dock line and conditions 15 19 23 and 27 indicate if it is an inbound or outbound trip respectively as discussed in section 2 2 3 readers are referred to appendix b at the end of the paper for the list of all notations case i of dock line for outbound trips 12a nl t i j k max t i τ i j t i 13a s t nl t i j k dmin t i j k 14a θ j φ i j t 180 θ j or 12b nl t i j k min t i τ i j t i 13b s t nl t i j k t i j k

s t nl t i j k dmin t i j k 26b θ j 180 φ i j t θ j 27 θ j 180 c i t θ j t dmin t i j k note that dmin t i j k can be determined based on formulation 7 11 formulations 12 27 provide a theoretical base to calculate the timestamp i e nl t i j k of the ais point last or next of the closest point once nl t i j k is found the distance from the corresponding ais point to the dock line can be easily found via the aforementioned gis function distance let nl d i j k denote such a distance then the time when vessel i crossed the dock line of dock j during its k th visit denoted as τ i j k can be determined through interpolation as eq 28 28 τ i j k nl d i j k dmin t i j k min d i j k based on eq 28 given visit k of vessel i the travel time between dock j and dock j 1 denoted as t t j j 1 i k can be determined as for outbound trips 29a t t j j 1 i k τ i j 1 k τ i j k for inbound trips 29b t t j j 1 i k τ i j k τ i j 1 k where τ i j k refers to the timestamp when vessel i crossed the dock line of dock j during its k th visit 2 2 5 solution algorithm sections 2 2 2 2 2 4 discuss the theoretical method of how to determine the time when a vessel crossed a dock line these formulations can be solved iteratively in this section a more detailed solution procedure is given given vessel i based on the method described in section 2 1 its arrival and departure times can be determined as defined before μ i k and λ i k refer to the departure and arrival times of vessel i in its k th visit and μ i k 1 the departure time of vessel i in its k 1st visit we have μ i k 1 λ i k μ i k i e for vessel i the departure time of the k th trip should be later than the arrival time of this visit and the arrival time of the k th visit should be later than the departure time of the k 1st visit note that if k 1 μ i k 1 min t i i e the earliest timestamp of vessel i in the dataset or if k n i i e the last visit λ i k 1 max t i i e the latest timestamp of vessel i in the dataset μ i k and λ i k can be determined by using the procedure described in section 2 1 2 input ais dataset of vessel i and the geometric location of the dock line of dock j in the following we called dock line j for simplicity step 0 based on the solution algorithm procedure described in section 2 1 2 identify the departure and arrival time of each trip i e μ i k and λ i k k 1 2 n i step 1 define a buffer based on the geometric location of dock line j then define the ais point set π i j based on this buffer if π i j is empty it implies that vessel i never crossed dock line j stop otherwise determine the direction of dock line i e θ j see fig 4 b and go to step 2 step 2 extract ais points in π i j based on the condition μ i k t λ i k for k 1 2 n i given visit k if no data available go to step 2 6 otherwise go to step 2 1 step 2 1 the ais data between μ i k and λ i k could cover the navigation data in both inbound and outbound directions according to the research needs extract the data in the outbound or inbound direction only based on the condition described in section 2 2 3 step 2 2 based on the dataset extracted between μ i k and λ i k for one direction determine the ais point that is closest to the dock line i e the point with min d i j k and the corresponding timestamp dmin t i j k step 2 3 determine φ i j so as to determine if we need to find the next or last point of the ais point that is closest to the dock line for the purpose of interpolation step 2 4 determine the desired last or next point based on the formulations described in section 2 2 4 if such last or next point does not exist it indicates that vessel i never crossed dock line j when moving inbound or outbound between time μ i k and λ i k so go to step 2 6 otherwise go to step 2 5 step 2 5 based on these two points conduct the interpolation to determine the time when vessel i across dock line j i e τ i j k step 2 6 go to the k 1st trip and repeat steps 2 1 2 5 until all trips made by vessel i is studied stop remarks 1 in step 1 π i j can be obtained easily using gis function buffer which is available in most popular gis packages such as arcgis and postgregis 2 if k 1 μ i k 1 min t i i e the earliest timestamp of vessel i in the dataset or if k n i i e the last trip λ i k 1 max t i i e the latest timestamp of vessel i in the dataset 3 in case that no dmin t i j k is available based on formulations 7 11 it implies that vessel i did not cross dock link j in its k th visit in the following the ais data in the hsc from 11 months of 2017 were used to test the algorithms described above to determine the travel time as well as to analyze the properties of travel time in the hsc 3 application to hsc 3 1 review of ais data and testbed for testing the algorithms described above we downloaded the ais data from marinecadastre gov developed by the u s national oceanic and administration office and bureau of ocean energy management the data of 2017 excluding february were employed errors were reported when importing the data of february to the database for 11 months there are totally 102 187 704 records in the upper section of the hsc see fig 1 and each month has 9 289 791 records on average all data were imported to a postgresql database and the solution algorithms in sections 2 1 2 and 2 2 5 were coded in pl pgsql though the data covers the whole upper section of the hsc this paper particularly looks at the section above the beltway 8 bridge see fig 7 in this section of the hsc the first dock above the bridge is dock 48 and the last one is dock 107 the dock lines of docks 55 and 54 are in a branch of the hsc not in the main channel the ais data from the 11 months of 2017 shows that no tanker and cargo used these two docks this section of the channel is narrow from the beltway 8 bridge until dock 107 end of the channel there is a one way traffic restriction the restriction starts from the beltway 8 bridge and the first dock above the bridge is 48 according to this restriction there cannot be any meeting of ships greater than 106 feet 32 m below the bridge there is combined beam restrictions fig 6 shows three different restrictions on the width beam of vessels for different narrow sections of the hsc large ships such as tankers and cargos in this section of the hsc are significantly impacted by wide body vessels with beam of 106 ft or more i e 32 m a wide body vessel can occupy the whole width of the channel when moving in this section of the hsc however as mentioned above most tugs are not impacted as their drafts are small enough so that they can be moored anywhere near the bank therefore the algorithm described in section 2 1 2 may not well capture a tug s real destination as well as its arrival and departure times as it stops frequently in the channel and not necessarily at a dock for these reasons only big ships travel times were studied the big ships in this study are considered as those having draft greater than 16 feet 4 87 m in the hsc only two types of big ships are considered tankers and cargos the number of passenger ship can be neglectable fig 8 a reports the monthly distributions of different vessel types in the hsc recorded in 11 months of 2017 it is seen that except tugs tankers and cargos were the major vessels therefore the travel times of only tankers and cargos were studied in this paper by using the algorithm described in section 2 1 1 the trips made by tankers and cargos in the section above the bridge in each month except february of 2017 were investigated and the results were reported in fig 8 b it is seen that tankers play an important role in the hsc in some months of 2017 tankers made nearly 200 trips to the docks located above the bridge implying that on average there were over 5 tankers in each day moving in this section of the hsc 3 2 distribution of travel time traversal time based on the ais data of 11 months of 2017 we firstly calculated destination dock departure and arrival times of each tanker and cargo according to the algorithm in section 2 1 2 then based on the revealed trips the draft of each trip was determined from the raw ais dataset finally based on the revealed trips focusing on outbound trips only the procedure for inbound trips is the same i e trips heading to the gulf we calculated the travel time of each tanker and cargo respectively from its destination dock to the bridge see fig 7 based on the algorithm described in section 2 2 5 a big ship s starting process from the stationery state is time consuming for increasing its speed and changing the heading direction a u turn may be needed therefore another type of travel time traversal time was considered in this paper a vessel s traversal time from one dock line to another is the time spent by this vessel in moving from that dock line to another under its normal navigation status since only outbound trips were considered for convenience if vessel i started from dock j its traversal time was calculated from dock line j 3 j 4 48 respectively to the bridge note that as shown in fig 7 the next of dock line 56 is dock line 53 and dock line 48 is the last one above the bridge for simplicity these two types of travel times are called 1 travel time from the destination dock and 2 traversal time respectively in the following text for each dock or dock line a series of travel times or traversal times were calculated respectively due to the data error and some special navigation status e g u turn some travel time data are particularly large since we focus on the regular navigation status to avoid generating some bias results it is necessary to remove these large travel traversal time data note that unlike traffic in highway vessel navigation in a waterway is fully controlled by a pilot and the dispatch of a vessel follows the plan a record is regarded to be an outlier if it is less than the value of the first quartile minus the 1 5 times iqr or greater than the value of the third quartile plus the 1 5 times iqr where iqr interquartile range is the distance between the third and first quartiles of the data montgomery et al 2010 actually it is found that the number of outliers is quite small on average only 5 97 for the travel time dataset and 1 88 for the traversal time dataset are identified as outliers more travel time data were found to be outliers because a vessel may make a u turn when departing from the dock the data error is also more likely to occur when a vessel starts from the stationery state the information of travel time and traversal time in a narrow channel is very useful for helping better managing vessel traffic in a narrow channel for example the reliability of travel time for different type of vessels can be obtained the delay caused by wide body vessels can be estimated moreover such information can help build a vessel dispatch scheme so as to minimize the travel delay this paper however aims to study the properties of these two types of travel time only apparently the number of traversal time data is much larger than the number of travel time data for those dock lines close to the bridge as we only looked at outbound trips for the purpose of statistical analysis at one dock or dock line if the sample size the number of travel times or traversal times of tankers and cargos was less than 20 for travel time data or 100 for traversal time data this dock was skipped for analysis the statistical summary of the two types of travel times were reported in table a1 in appendix a at the end of this paper as expected a large amount of time is required in the starting process it is seen that the mean travel time from one dock to the bridge is much larger than the corresponding traversal time from the dock line of the same dock to the bridge to better understand the properties of these two types of travel time their distributions were estimated using two methods the kolmogorov smirnov k s and chi square goodness of fit tests via matlab respectively under two types of tests the p values under four most commonly used distributions gamma lognormal normal and weibull distributions were calculated respectively with or without outliers based on the p values reported by each test the number of datasets estimated to follow each type of distribution was reported in table 1 note that the default significance level is 0 05 if the p value of a test is no more than 0 05 the null hypothesis that the samples are from a desired distributed population can be rejected otherwise we cannot reject the hypothesis that the data follow a certain type of distribution from table 1 it is seen that 1 outliers have significant impact on type of distribution estimate 2 the results under two tests are close though the chi square test seems to be stricter and 3 few seem to be weibull distributed so in the following we focus on the first three types of distributions through monte carlo tests wang 2009 concluded that given the significance level of 0 05 the k s test seems to be more effective than the chi square test because the former exhibits smaller type i error and larger power except the case that the null hypothesis has a known mean therefore we just reported the p values of the k s tests in appendix a 1 other methods were also employed in the literature for example kang et al 2018 2019 employed the normal probability plot to check the normality of travel time data in the strait of singapore in the literature traversal times of vehicles in an uncongested highway section are sometimes assumed to be normally distributed lo et al 2006 shao et al 2006 for vessel traffic in the channel some studies also found that the traversal times are normally distributed xiao et al 2015 kang et al 2018 2019 however interestingly it is seen from table a1 that even though most travel times from destination docks to the bridge are normally distributed p values 0 05 most traversal times are not instead it is seen that the traversal time from each dock line to the bridge is more likely to follow a lognormal distribution p values 0 05 even excluding outliers note that for traversal time datasets on average 85 outliers are on the right tail it implies that the traversal times of different types and sizes of vessels may have different distributions this postulation will be studied in the next section as to the travel time from destination docks to the bridge since the time spent in starting process is large it entails that such time for starting process is similar across different types and sizes of ships 3 3 factors impacting traversal time to better understand why traversal time is not normally distributed we aimed to investigate which factors could impact the traversal time in the hsc the following 5 factors were considered a type of a vessel tanker or cargo b width of a vessel a vessel is wide body wb if its width is 32 m 106 ft or larger non wb otherwise such information was provided by the pilots of the hsc c draft of a vessel a vessel is in draft class 1 d1 if its draft is at most 9 m in draft class 3 d3 if its draft is more than 11 m and in draft class 2 d2 otherwise d time of day daytime if the time arriving at the bridge is later than 6 00 but earlier than 19 30 in may june july and august or later than 6 30 but earlier than 18 30 in march april september and october note that it is under daylight saving time or later than 7 30 but earlier than 17 00 in january november and december no ais data in february nighttime otherwise e month january march april december no ais data in february note that among these 5 factors two are temporal factors time of day and month two are related with vessel itself type and width and one is related with both vessel and voyage draft to investigate the impacts of these factors a series of the analysis of variance anova were conducted note that anova requires the sample under each category to be normally distributed therefore the k s test was first used to test the normality of the samples in the category of each factor for example the traversal time of wide body vessels tankers and cargos from dock line 59 to the bridge was found not normally distributed so the anova for the factor of vessel width could not be conducted for this dataset traversal time from dock line 59 under each factor the sample size varies for example there were 819 wide body tankers but only 340 non wide body tankers for all 11 months of 2017 therefore two way anova with unequal sample size considering one temporal factor and one vessel feature were used in matlab and the p value in each test was reported in table a2 in appendix a the p values show that both temporal factors time of day and month did not have significant impact on traversal time from each dock line to the bridge this finding is somewhat different from our experience on highway traffic which have peak hours and off peak hours and link travel time distributions are usually time dependent wu 2013 the reason probably is that the traffic of big vessels in a narrow and busy channel such as the hsc is fully monitored by the port authority and big vessels are fully controlled by pilots assigned by the port authority on the other hand the factors of vessel features especially width and draft were found to significantly impact the traversal time from all dock lines and vessel type had significant impact on the traversal time from most dock lines therefore we conclude that the traversal time is largely impacted by vessel features such as its width draft and type to better understand such impact the comparison across different vessel features were further investigated first the traversal times of wide body and large draft draft class 3 denoted as wb d3 tankers and cargos were compared with those of non wide body and small draft draft class 1 denoted as nwb d1 ones from each dock line if the sample size was large enough it was found that from all dock lines the former is always greater than the latter i e larger ships ran slower fig 9 a reports the distribution of the mean and median differences between wb d3 and nwb d1 ships respectively for example from the same dock line to the bridge nearly 43 of wb d3 cargos saw the mean traversal time 10 longer than nwb d1 cargos while almost 28 of wb d3 tankers found the mean travel time 15 longer than nwb d1 tankers such difference is significant further fig 9 a also shows that the difference between big and small tankers is larger than the difference between large and small cargos then the difference between tankers and cargos were investigated when they were both wb d3 or nwb d1 the distribution of the mean and median differences was reported in fig 9 b respectively for example if both were big ships wb d3 as to mean traversal time nearly 20 of tankers saw 8 longer than cargos however if both were small nwb d1 over 50 of tankers saw only 2 more than cargos it well implies that big tankers moved slower than big cargos but the difference between small tankers and cargos were not clear 3 4 spatial correlation in a highway network if one link suffers from traffic congestions its adjacent upstream 2 2 in the hsc the upstream direction refers to the direction from the gulf of mexico to the port of houston link is very likely to be congested too this is called spatial correlation to the best knowledge of the authors such spatial correction was not studied for vessel traffic in waterways for narrow and busy channels such correlation is likely to impact travel time of vessels significantly the revealed traversal times from one dock lines to another opens the door for answering this question in last section it was already found that vessel features have significant impact on traversal times for this reason the spatial correlation was studied in different categories in terms of vessel type width and draft such as wb d3 tankers or cargos nwb d1 tankers or cargos etc considering the sample size as at least 100 samples were preferred from one dock line we picked a section of the channel from dock line 70 to the bridge so totally 21 links were covered note that the next of dock line 56 is dock line 53 for one vessel its traversal time from one dock line to the next dock line was calculated as link traversal times see eq 29 as we already calculated the traversal time from one dock line to the bridge it would be easy to get such link traversal time of one vessel one observation of a series of link traversal times came from one vessel when it passed through the channel from dock line 70 to the bridge since wide body tankers cargos in draft class 1 wb d1 and non wide body tankers cars in draft class 3 nwb d3 were unusual small sample size only 4 categories of vessels were considered here wb d3 wb d2 nwb d2 nwb d1 for tankers and cargos respectively so 8 correlation coefficient matrixes were calculated respectively 4 types of tankers and cargos respectively each matrix has a size of 20 20 as there are 21 links fig 10 summarizes such correlation coefficient matrixes based on the distance between two links two links are adjacent links if they are just separated by 1 dock line and since there are totally 21 dock lines the farthest two links are separated by 20 dock lines from fig 10 we can clearly see that the correlation coefficient between two adjacent links are close to 1 in most cases only two cases of cargos where the coefficient is below 0 7 which can be regarded as outliers also when two links are separated by more dock lines the correlation becomes weaker however even if two links are separated by 10 dock lines the correlation coefficients are still about 0 5 these findings well indicate that the link traversal time between links in the hsc are highly positively correlated 4 discussion and conclusions this paper proposes a novel ais data based model and the corresponding algorithms to estimate the travel time of vessels between any two points in narrow and busy channel the model has two components 1 to determine the destination dock of a vessel as well as its arrival and departure times from this dock and 2 to determine the timestamp when a vessel passed a landmark of interest in the channel this model can help us easily determine the travel time of a vessel from one point to another in the channel including the travel time from its destination dock to a specific landmark or vice versa in the channel based on the proposed model this paper employed the ais data of 11 months in 2017 collected in the hsc to study the property of travel times of tankers and cargos focusing on the section of channel above the beltway 8 bridge this narrow section has lots of docks making traffic condition in this section critical considering outbound trips only two types of travel times were defined 1 the travel time from a vessel s destination dock to the bridge starting from the stationery state and 2 the traversal time from one dock line to the bridge when a vessel went through this distance under the normal navigation status apparently from the same dock the travel time is much longer than the traversal time as the starting process is time consuming the findings of travel time properties were summarized as follows f if considering all tankers and cargos together with various size and draft the traversal time from a dock line to the bridge is likely to be lognormally distributed not normally distributed on the other hand in most cases the travel time from a destination dock to the bridge is normally distributed g time of day daytime or nighttime and month have insignificant impact on the distribution of traversal time from each dock line to the bridge on the other hand vessel width draft and vessel types were found have significant impact especially the width and draft h larger ships moved slower and the difference is not small on average the mean traversal time of wide body wb 32 m tankers in draft class 3 d3 11 m was 12 longer than that of non wide body nwb tankers in draft class 1 d1 9 m while for cargos such difference was a little bit smaller 9 on average on the other hand the difference on median traversal time was even larger wb d3 tankers experienced averagely 13 longer median traversal time than nwb d1 tankers and while for cargos such difference was also about 9 on average i tankers generally moved slower than cargos especially for larger ships on average the mean traversal time of wb d3 tankers was 4 larger than wb d3 cargos while only 2 more if comparing between nwb d1 tankers with nwb d1 cargos on the other hand wb d3 tankers saw averagely 5 longer median traversal time than wb d3 cargos but the median traversal times between nwb d1 tankers and cargos were very close only 1 more on average j the traversal times between two adjacent links in the hsc were significantly positively correlated the correlation coefficient is close to 1 implying if one link suffers from congestion the upstream adjacent link is very likely to see congestion too such correlation decreases when one link is farther away from another but even if two links are separated by 10 dock lines the correlation coefficient is still about 0 5 these findings are well consistent with the real experience it shows that the proposed models and solution algorithms produce reasonable travel time estimates by building an inventory of travel times between any two points in the channel we will know the travel time distributions and it opens the door for many studies including the estimate of the vessel delay caused by congestion in the channel the optimization of dispatching vessels in the channel etc the research team has started the research on these topics even if the aforementioned models and solution algorithms were developed based on the research needs of the hsc they can be easily applied to any other ship channels statement of author contributions xing wu developed the models for estimating the arrival and departure times of vessels at their destination docks cleaned

21966,in ocean engineering the fatigue damage evaluation of structures subjected to random stress in the design stage is of great practical interest the stress can be a single mode bimodal or multi modal gaussian process traditional spectral methods used to focus on establishing a probabilistic model for the rainflow stress cycles to count the accumulation of damage recently authors have developed a state of the art bimodal spectral discretization method which crosses the border of traditional methods by introducing a coupling coefficient ξ to reflect the interaction between low and high frequency components the present study extends this accurate bimodal method to solve the more complicated trimodal gaussian problems a cubic coefficient is developed to account for cross mode couplings among low medium and high frequency components extensive comparisons with time domain rainflow counting method and traditional spectral methods are conducted to validate the high level of accuracy and efficiency of this trimodal method moreover via the proposed trimodal method the respective contributions of different frequencies and their couplings to the overall fatigue damage in a multi modal situation can be thoroughly differentiated comprehensive case studies including an analysis of a floating wind turbine have evidenced the important role of cross mode couplings in the total damage of fatigue keywords fatigue damage gaussian trimodal cross mode coupling spectral discretization 1 introduction fatigue life evaluation plays a crucial role at the design stage of an engineering structure especially for a structure who will experience harsh and cyclic environmental loadings in its service life since the early study of fatigue damage assessment the major attention has been on two issues i e one is the cycle counting of different levels of stress ranges and the other is the resultant fatigue damage from the counted cycles in the time domain analysis the cycle counting is straightforward and various methods were proposed for fatigue damage evaluation including peak counting level crossing counting range mean counting and rainflow counting rfc methods rychlik 1993 benasciutti and tovo 2006 among these methods the rfc method downing and socie 1982 has been widely accepted as the standard cycle counting method kumar and stathopoulos 1998 dnv 2006 in fatigue analysis for decades the success of the rfc method is due to its accurate capture of the largest stress cycles which are of most concern in fatigue evaluation after the cycle counting is obtained through the rfc the accumulated fatigue damage can be predicted by the well known s n curve of material and the linear palmgren miner rule miner 1945 when sufficiently long stress series are available the time domain rfc analysis for the fatigue evaluation is always the first choice regardless of level of non gaussianity and bandwidth in the time series however the time series data of stress from field or laboratory measurement is rather limited even in fem finite element method structural analysis the simulated response is not abundant as a large number of degree of freedoms and complex nonlinearities in the system impede fast calculation moreover the duration is long for instance to simulate the responses of an oil platform in a 6 h wave storm the time domain computational task is almost an impossible mission consequently a quick fatigue prediction turns to be an expensive expectation in the design stage the frequency domain analysis or so called spectral analysis is an alternative approach more often chosen by engineers when the stochastic stress process is narrow banded nb and gaussian its amplitudes follow the rayleigh distribution newland 2005 therefore the accumulated fatigue can be easily calculated by integrating the probabilistic function however when concerns move to wide banded wb processes the spectral method is somewhat powerless as the analytic solution of the rainflow stress cycles does not exist aiming to remove this barrier researchers began to establish different probabilistic models to match the rainflow amplitude distribution of a wb gaussian process studies by wirsching and light 1980 dirlik 1985 zhao and baker 1992 lutes and larsen 1990 benasciutti and tovo 2005 park et al 2014 to name some are very valuable in ocean engineering a marine structure always suffers the coupled action from environmental loadings like wind waves and currents fortunately in many situations the structural mass is very large and the stiffness is high so that the dynamic vibration system can be idealized as a linear filter between the loadings and the responses therefore the response spectrum exhibits multi modal characteristics but the level of non gaussianity of response is much lower than that of the environmental loadings zheng et al 2007 this is the underlying multi modal gaussian fatigue damage problem treated in the present study for a specific bimodal gaussian case which only includes two separated and distinguished peaks respectively corresponding to the low frequency lf mode and the high frequency hf mode in the spectrum jiao and moan 1990 developed a pioneering probabilistic frame for the fatigue assessment in the jiao moan jm method the total fatigue damage caused by a bimodal process is defined as the summation of the small cycle damage due to the hf component and the large cycle damage predominated by the envelope of the superimposed lf and hf components following the jm method a number of methods have been proposed to further improve the accuracy and efficiency in probabilistic fatigue assessment sakai and okamura 1995 fu and cebon 2000 low 2010 ma et al 2018 among these methods the low s low method is the most comprehensive but sophisticated one two effects are taken into account one is effect a corresponding to the overestimation of small cycle amplitudes in the jm method in that the presence of the lf process would diminish the amplitudes of the small cycles the other one is effect b understanding that the amplitude of a large cycle is smaller than the direct addition of the hf and lf amplitudes because the peaks of the lf and hf component processes have phase offsets hence in the low method phase variables are introduced to modify the amplitude distribution to eliminate these two effects the low s method has showed its remarkable accuracy in a number of studies low 2011 2014 however the complicated analytical solutions hinder its engineering applications so far the abovementioned spectral analysis methods all focus on establishing a probabilistic model for rainflow amplitudes of wb processes recently a novel spectral fatigue assessment method for bimodal processes has been developed by the authors gao and zheng 2019 the method starts from discretizing the spectrum into a large quantity of infinitesimal frequency bands first the accumulation fatigue of each band is then calculated according to the classical nb method by importing a coefficient ξ to further assemble these discretized fatigue damages this newly proposed method manages to capture the coupling effects between the lf and hf modes it has been proven to be more accurate than the single moment spectral method which employs the projection by projection pbp rule to obtain total damage benasciutti et al 2013 trimodal processes are more complex than bimodal processes as there are three distinct frequency regimes in the spectrum i e low frequency lf medium frequency mf high frequency hf realistic offshore structures like offshore compliant towers in deep water are driven by lf swell mf wind waves and hf morison forces karimirad and moan 2011a and a marine riser is excited by lf vessel motions mf wave loads and hf vortex induced vibration under ocean current gao and moan 2008 the quadratic coupling phenomenon would therefore exist between any two frequency components whereas the cubic coupling phenomenon among three frequency components is more intricate gao and moan the gm method extended the jiao moan method to tackle trimodal problems based on the theory of combined processes gao and moan 2008 the parametric studies of ideal trimodal processes showed that the developed trimodal formulation is satisfactory with the relative errors below 20 otherwise if the frequencies are not well separated or the lowest frequency component does not dominate the whole spectral energy the damage can be heavily overestimated with relative errors exceeding 50 low 2011 low also developed a trimodal spectral formulation low 2011 which claims to be more accurate than the gm method nevertheless low s trimodal formulation is not only mathematically more complicated than the bimodal formulation low 2010 but also demands very expensive computational cost hence its potential in engineering practice is rather limited as the extension of author s recent work on bimodal fatigue assessment this paper carries its objective to develop an accurate and straightforward method for the fatigue assessment of trimodal processes in the frequency domain different from a bimodal case couplings in a trimodal case are more complicated as the spectrum contains three principal frequency modes so that not only more quadratic couplings are involved but also a cubic coupling has to be considered in fatigue estimation comprehensive description interpretation and numerical formulation of inter modal couplings therefore become the major task of this study while the main novelty comes from devising trimodal coupling furthermore beyond accuracy and efficiency it is of great interest to fathom the importance of coupling effects among frequency modes this paper is organized as follows a brief introduction to the basic knowledge of spectral fatigue analysis method is given first it is followed by the summary of authors bimodal method after that the theory of the extended trimodal methods and case studies are exposed the results of case studies have validated both accuracy and robustness of the proposed method for the first time for a tri modal spectrum the respective contributions of lf mf and hf frequencies and their couplings to the overall fatigue damage can be differentiated in the end key findings are highlighted in the conclusion part 2 basics of spectral fatigue analysis when the structural stress x t is considered as a stationary gaussian process in the frequency domain its n th order spectral moment λ n can be readily calculated by the spectral density function g ω i e 1 λ n

0 2 1 narrow band method though there is no rigorous criterion to demarcate nb and wb random processes in general cases of δ 0 1 are treated as nb for a nb gaussian process x t it is known that the amplitude r follows a rayleigh distribution 5 f r r r λ 0 exp r 2 2 λ 0 where λ 0 σ x 2 is the corresponding variance by invoking the palmgren miner linear damage accumulation rule and the s n curve the fatigue damage per unit time has the following closed form expression 6 d n b ν 0 c 2 2 λ 0 k γ 1 k 2 where c and k are both material parameters in s n curve and n c s k is the number of cycles to failure at the stress range s γ is gamma function 2 2 single moment sm method if the process is wb numerous approximate methods have been proposed to match the rainflow amplitude distribution two important methods are reviewed here one is the well known single moment sm method developed by larsen and lutes 1991 they used the generalized spectral moment of order 2 k to refine the rayleigh formulation in eq 6 i e 7 d s m 2 2 k 2 π c λ 2 k k 2 γ 1 k 2 this formula was empirical but was proven to be accurate in general wb cases larsen and lutes 1991 benasciutti and tovo 2006 including the bimodal spectrum with two close neighboring spectral peaks recently benasciutti et al 2013 provided a mathematical interpretation for the sm method from a spectral discretization view and it will be illustrated in detail in the following section 2 3 dirlik method another method was developed by dirlik 1985 and is widely used in engineering bouyssy et al 1993 low 2014 in this method the probabilistic distribution of the stress range s 2r is approximated as 8 f s s 1 2 σ x h 1 v e z v h 2 z h 2 e z 2 2 h 2 h 3 z e z 2 2 where z is the normalized stress range i e z s 2 σ x and 9 x m λ

counting methods benasciutti and tovo 2005 2006 i e 11 d r m d r f c d l c and developed a method for general wb processes in terms of nb damage as follows benasciutti and tovo 2005 2006 12 d t b b t

obtained from a large amount of time domain simulations the simulations include five typical spectra and material parameter k 3 and 5 are considered however note that in eq 13 b tb is a function of spectral bandwidth parameters α 1 and α 2 only not linked to the material parameter k 3 spectral discretization methods for bimodal processes 3 1 bimodal processes as shown in fig 1 the spectral density function of a bimodal random process y t contains two separated bands respectively corresponding to the lf component x lf t and the hf component x hf t these two components are usually assumed probabilistically independent such that the time series of y t can be represented as 14 y t x l f t x h f t in fig 1 subscripts ub and lb respectively denote the upper bound and the lower bound of a frequency component the subscript chr denotes the characteristic frequency for rectangular spectra the characteristic frequency is the mid frequency i e ω c h r ω m i d the frequency ratio γ between the hf mode and lf mode is then defined as 15 γ h l ω c h r h f ω c h r l f correspondingly the power ratio or say variance ratio β is written as 16 β h l ω l b h f ω u b h f g ω d ω ω l b l f ω u b l f g ω d ω 3 2 spectral discretization technique works of benasciutti et al 2013 2016 provided a new idea called spectral discretization technique for fatigue assessment in the frequency domain they suggested that the stress power spectrum can be first discretized into a set of infinitesimal bands and each of them is assumed as an independent nb stochastic process of frequency ω i then the damage of each band is calculated through the rayleigh method as follow 17 d i ν 0 i c 2 2 λ 0 i k γ 1 k 2 where λ 0 i is the corresponding zero order spectral moment variance and ν 0 i ω i 2 π the total damage of the process is then summed up from fatigue damages of these infinitesimal bands according to a rational rule moreover benasciutti et al 2013 2016 suggested that the nonlinear assembly rule called projection by projection cristofori et al 2011 be used i e 18 d p b p i 1 n u m d i 2 k k 2 where num is the number of discretized bands combining eqs 17 and 18 the total damage is 19 d t o t a l d p b p i 1 n u m ω i 2 π c 2 2 g ω i δ ω k γ 1 k 2 2 k k 2 2 2 k 2 π c γ 1 k 2 i 1 n u m ω i 2 k g ω i δ ω k 2 2 2 k 2 π c γ 1 k 2 λ 2 k k 2 d s m thus the spectral discretization method with pbp rule is actually the discrete form of the famous sm formula in eq 7 when applying the spectral discretization method in practice the value of num needs to meet two criterions one is that the discretized bands should be sufficiently small to follow the rayleigh assumption the other one is that the calculation of the spectral moment from the discretized bands is sufficiently accurate 3 3 coupling effects in bimodal processes on the surface the pbp scheme in the sm method is a kind of nonlinear assembly rule however the interesting research by braccesi et al 2015 indicated that the sm formula ignores the coupling effects between different frequency components consider the variance of the summation of two random variables i e 20 w x y σ w 2 σ x 2 σ y 2 2 cov x y where w is the summation of variables x and y note that the covariance of x and y is involved to calculate σ w 2 inspired by eq 20 each discretized frequency band can be considered as a random variable and their spectral moments λ 0 i can be assumed to be variances if means are zeros these zero order spectral moments can be summed up like eq 20 and then substituted into the rayleigh formulation eq 6 to calculate the total damage fatigue braccesi et al 2015 suggested that before λ 0 i are summed up they should be normalized to have the same frequency i e 21 λ ˆ 0 i f i f ˆ 2 k λ 0 i in which f ˆ is the reference frequency and λ ˆ 0 i is the corresponding normalized zero order spectral moment in addition if λ ˆ 0 i are assumed to be mutually independent the normalized total zero order spectral moment is λ ˆ t o t a l i 1 n u m λ ˆ 0 i subsequently substituting λ ˆ t o t a l to eq 6 and calculating the total damage with ν 0 f ˆ leads to the identical form of the sm formula in eq 7 hence although the pbp scheme is a nonlinear rule the sm method ignores the correlations among the distinctive frequency components in the formulation this is the reason why the sm method might generate fatigue damage significantly deviating from the rfc result for bimodal processes the combination rule of the sm method in many situations cannot reasonably account for the fact that the hf frequency rides on the lf frequency and they are superimposed in the bimodal process to affect the overall fatigue damage however when γ hl 2 the sm method in eq 7 can provide good results as the bimodal coupling characteristics are insignificant and the process is more like a unimodal process 3 4 proposed bimodal method on the basis of eq 19 a new spectral discretization method is developed by authors gao and zheng 2019 to account for the interaction between lf and hf modes in bimodal processes after both lf and hf bands have been discretized into num infinitesimal nb bands the total fatigue damage is calculated through 22 d t o t a l 2 2 k 2 π c γ 1 k 2 λ 2 k l f λ 2 k h f λ 2 k l f h f k 2 23 λ 2 k l f i 1 n u m ω i l f 2 k g ω i l f δ ω l f 24 λ 2 k h f i 1 n u m ω i h f 2 k g

band and the hf band respectively the new incoming cross term λ 2 k l f h f reflects the coupling between lf and hf in λ 2 k l f h f a coefficient ξ is introduced to describe the degree of the coupling between the two modes specifically the coupling corresponding to any two discretized frequency bands ω i l f and ω i h f is denoted as ξ i i l f h f in eq 25 the coefficient ξ is a function of γ β k and its empirical expression is obtained through the nonlinear optimization technique combined with a comprehensive data set generated from monte carlo simulations in the reference paper gao and zheng 2019 a large number of combinations of γ β k are considered to cover a wide range of engineering problems the resultant expression shown in eq 26 is applicable to cases of γ 2 15 β 0 05 2 0 and k 3 9 26 ξ p 1 p 2 ln γ p 3 ln β p 4 ln γ 2 p 5 ln β 2 p 6 ln γ ln β 1 p 7 ln γ p 8 ln β p 9 ln γ 2 p 10 ln β 2 p 11 ln γ ln β where p u a 0 u a 1 u k a 2 u k 2 u 1 2 11 which are second order polynomials of k their coefficients a 0 u a 1 u and a 2 u are given in the appendix of reference gao and zheng 2019 it is straightforward to use eqs 22 26 in computer coding it has been validated through several case studies that even if ξ i i l f h f coupling of frequency bands is replaced by ξ l f h f coupling of modes lf and hf in eq 25 damage results of the same levels of accuracy can be still reached therefore 27 λ 2 k l f h f ξ l f h f i 1 n u m ω i l f 2 k g ω i l f δ ω l f ω i h f 2 k g ω i h f δ ω h f note that ξ l f h f is calculated through eqs 15 16 26 equation 27 is simpler than eq 25 but it pays more attention to the coupling between lf and hf modes obviously when lf and hf are ideal nb these two equations are identical discussions and case studies after this section are all based on eq 27 fig 2 illustrates the physical meanings of eqs 22 27 specifically when the hf mode in the bimodal process is wb the situation is only slightly more complicated by decomposing the hf mode into several hf sub modes c f gao and zheng 2019 for details 4 proposed trimodal method the principle of the newly developed bimodal method is to reflect coupling effects in the frequency domain eqs 22 27 by importing a cross term λ 2 k l f h f with coefficient ξ this principle is herein extended to trimodal cases with some smart improvement the trimodal process can be represented as 28 y t x l f t x m f t x h f t in which x m f t is the medium frequency mf component consider a rectangular trimodal gaussian process whose one side power spectrum is shown in fig 3 similar to bimodal cases some characteristic parameters are defined as 29 γ h l ω c h r h f ω c h r l f γ h m ω c h r h f ω c h r m f γ m l ω c h r m f ω c h r l f 30 β h l ω l b h f ω u b h f g ω d ω ω l b l f ω u b l

trimodal spectrum the cross mode couplings should account for the interactions between lf hf lf mf mf hf and lf mf hf similar to eq 22 the corresponding expression for trimodal cases is so rewritten as 31 d t o t a l 2 2 k 2 π c γ 1 k 2 λ 2 k t o t a l k 2 32 λ 2 k t o t a l λ 2 k l f λ 2 k m f λ 2 k h f λ 2 k l f m f λ 2 k l f h f λ 2 k m f h f λ 2 k l f m f h f in eq 32 terms λ 2 k l f and λ 2 k h f are identical to eqs 23 24 the addition λ 2 k m f is the 2 k order spectral moment of the medium frequency component which represents the individual fatigue damage from the mf mode the cross terms i e λ 2 k l f m f λ 2 k m f h f λ 2 k l f h f are from quadratic coupling effects and the term λ 2 k l f m f h f is of the cubic coupling effect expressions of these terms will be given in the next two sections to give a clearer understanding of eqs 31 32 a graphical representation is shown in fig 4 each mode is discretized into num frequency bands similar to the bimodal method when applying eqs 31 32 to evaluate the fatigue damage of a trimodal process the first step is to identify the hf component is nb or wb because the interaction mechanism is different in these two scenarios 4 1 trimodal cases with nb hf mode to dig out the characteristics of interactions in trimodal processes consider fig 5 where the time series of a trimodal gaussian process is shown in this process the lf mf and hf modes are all nb the lf component plays a role of carrier while both mf and hf components are superimposed on it almost all stress cycles are affected by the three frequency components simultaneously effects on the stress cycles due to the interactions of the different modes are versatile the interactions might lead to a very large stress cycle if the peaks of the three modes coincide in phase on the contrary if peaks and troughs coincide the resultant stress cycles are small as a result coupling effects must be taken seriously in analysis of multi modal processes equations 33 37 are the expressions of the terms in eq 32 for the nb hf cases 33 λ 2 k l f i 1 n u m s m i l f λ 2 k m f i 1 n u m s m i m f λ 2 k h f i 1 n u m s m i h f 34 λ 2 k l f m f ξ l f m f i

s m i h f 3 36 ξ l f m f h f ξ l f m f ξ m f h f ξ l f h f 3 where 37 s m i l f ω i l f 2 k g ω i l f δ ω l f s m i m f ω i m f 2 k g ω i m f δ ω m f s m i h f ω i h f 2 k g ω i h f δ ω h f a new face of ξ occurs in eq 35 i e ξ l f m f h f it is the coefficient reflecting the cubic coupling interactions among the three modes if the empirical fit of this coefficient is still via monte carlo simulations the number of simulations should be great and the fitted expression would become tedious and unstable after a lot of trial and errors the form in eq 36 which is sourced from the high order wave perturbation theory ohyama et al 1995 stands out to be the best option to account for trimodal couplings in the nb hf cases the feasibility and accuracy of eqs 33 37 are to be validated in later case studies 4 2 trimodal cases with wb hf mode in fig 6 a gaussian trimodal process with wb hf mode is illustrated different from fig 5 when the hf mode becomes wb the superimposed phenomenon is found to be more intricate and more irregular with many more small ripples on the profile several hf components ride on lf and mf cycles simultaneously in such a case the interactions between hf lf or between hf mf can no longer be regarded as one to one moreover the cubic coupling lf mf hf also becomes more complicated decomposition of wb hf mode into several sub modes less than 5 is necessary see gao and zheng 2019 the terms that related to hf mode in eq 32 i e λ 2 k l f h f λ 2 k m f h f and λ 2 k l f m f h f should be reformulated to reflect the wb hf effects fig 7 is the graphic illustration of the sub mode decomposition scheme developed for the trimodal process with wb hf component to calculate λ 2 k l f λ 2 k m f and λ 2 k l f m f eq 33 and eq 34 can still be applied however as the wb hf mode is decomposed into m sub modes λ 2 k h f is reformulated as 38 λ 2 k h f j 1 m λ 2 k j h f in which λ 2 k j h f is the 2 k spectral moment of the j th hf sub mode λ 2 k j h f is computed according to 39 λ 2 k j h f i 1 n u m s m j i h f where 40 s m j i h f ω j i h f 2 k g ω j i h f δ ω h f and ω j i h f denotes the i th discretized frequency band in the j th hf sub mode j 1 2 m each hf sub mode will interact with lf and mf modes thus for the j th sub mode we have 41 λ 2 k j l f h f ξ j l f h f i 1 n u m s m i l f s m j i h f m 42 λ 2 k j m f h f ξ j m f h f i 1 n u m s m i m f s m j i h f m the corresponding coefficient ξ j l f h f reflects the degree of the coupling effect between lf mode and the j th hf sub mode this coefficient is the function see eq 26 of frequency ratio γ j h l ω j c h r h f ω c h r l f and power ratio β j h l λ 0 j h f λ 0 l f where λ 0 j h f and λ 0 l f are zero order spectral moments of the j th hf sub mode and lf mode respectively see eq 1 similarly ξ j m f h f is the function of γ j h m ω j c h r h f ω c h r m f and β j h m λ 0 j h f λ 0 m f the associated terms λ 2 k l f h f and λ 2 k m f h f in eq 32 are then obtained by summing λ 2 k j l f h f and λ 2 k j m f h f respectively i e 43 λ 2 k l f h f j 1 m λ 2 k j l f h f 44 λ 2 k m f h f j 1 m λ 2 k j m f h f also the cubic coupling term λ 2 k l f m f h f is the summation of λ 2 k j l f m f h f j 1 2 m which accounts for interactions among lf mf modes and the j th hf sub mode i e 45 λ 2 k l f m f h f j 1 m λ 2 k j l f m f h f λ 2 k j l f m f h f ξ j l f m f h f i 1 n u m s m i l f s m i m f s m j i h f m 3 specifically 46 ξ j l f m f h f ξ l f m f ξ j l f h f ξ j m f h f 3 to more clearly illustrate the detailed algorithm of the proposed trimodal method a flowchart is given in fig 8 5 case study since there exists a large number of combinations of power ratios and frequency ratios it is prohibitive to take all combinations into account it is preferable to study representative situations in the engineering practice totally 11 trimodal rectangular spectra and a practical engineering spectrum are discussed in this section the accuracy of the proposed trimodal method is compared with the well known sm method dirlik method and tb method in addition results of the gm method and the low method are compared in case 1 the time domain rfc result is used as benchmark reference the corresponding gaussian stress time series for rfc analysis are simulated by the fast fourier transform fft technique yang 1972 1973 zheng et al 2007 to ensure the convergence of simulations each stress time series comprises at least 1 million lf stress cycles and each hf stress cycle consists of at least 32 intervals as illustrated in table 1 each of the 11 cases has same power ratios among three frequency modes β lf mf β lf hf 1 and same characteristic frequency of lf component also among all cases the frequency ratio of mf to lf is identical γ lf mf 3 the differences come from two aspects one is the frequency ratio of hf to lf either 6 or 9 the other is spectral bandwidth parameter it can be seen from table 1 that cases 1 7 are nb hf with bandwidth parameter δ hf 0 05 while cases 8 11 are wb hf with δ hf 0 2774 note that 0 2774 is derived from α 1 0 9608 it also corresponds to α 2 0 8809 indicating a moderately wide banded spectrum in cases 1 4 as the bandwidth parameters of all three modes are so small all of them can be regarded as ideal nb these four cases are useful to uncover the fundamental characteristics of couplings in a trimodal process in addition the comparisons in this study also cover results of the gm method and the low method for case 1 all cases use s n parameters of c 1 normalized and k 3 4 5 6 5 1 trimodal processes comprising nb hf mode 5 1 1 trimodal processes of ideal nb modes fig 9 plots the two typical nb rectangular trimodal spectra in case 1 and case 2 in case 1 the three frequency modes are of the same vanmarcke bandwidth fig 9a δ lf δ mf δ hf 0 05 in case 2 the three frequency modes are of equal spectral density but distinct vanmarcke bandwidths fig 9b δ lf 0 05 δ mf 0 0167 δ hf 0 0056 tables 2 and 3 list the relative errors of all spectral methods when compared to the rfc method it is clear that the proposed method outperforms the sm method the dirlik method and the tb method in both case 1 and case 2 the relative errors of the proposed method are lower than 4 2 in all situations the deviations caused by the sm method the dirlik method and the tb method increase with the material parameter k especially in case 2 the deviations by these three methods both exceed 19 when k 6 in table 2 the results of the gm method and the low method see low 2011 are also given for case 1 for comparison it can be found that the accuracy of low method is very good and comparable to the proposed method when k 3 and 4 the proposed method behaves better than the low method with relative deviations to rfc less than 0 4 however the low method is complicated in computer coding and the computation is very time consuming by comparison the proposed method only requires one hundredth of a second to fulfill the computation effort among all spectral methods the performance of the gm method is obviously worst it dramatically underestimates the fatigue damage though the deviation for k 3 is less than 10 the deviations for k 5 and 6 exceed 30 the significant deviation might be caused by the so called effect a and effect b low 2010 which is ignored in jiao moan s bimodal method as the gm method was developed from jiao moan method such a drawback is inherited note that the low method and the gm method are more appropriate for nb modes thus their applicability to wb modes is limited the following comparisons and discussions will be carried out among the sm method the dirlik method the tb method and the proposed trimodal method in order to address the significance of cross mode couplings in the trimodal process the generalized 2 k order spectral moments due to different frequency components and their coupling effects i e λ 2 k in eq 32 are calculated the results of case 1 are listed in table 4 where the percentages correspond to the weights of each term relative to λ 2 k t o t a l in eq 32 it is obvious that the major contributions to the fatigue damage come from λ 2 k l f λ 2 k m f and λ 2 k h f among them λ 2 k h f has the largest proportion this explains why the traditional sm method in eq 7 can give good prediction results for many engineering problems especially for small k although the method actually ignores cross mode couplings but the weight from λ 2 k h f decreases with the increase of k for large k the total weight from lf and mf is greater than that of hf it is also noticeable that the weight of λ 2 k l f m f h f due to the cubic coupling effect is of the same order of magnitude as the quadratic coupling terms like λ 2 k l f m f λ 2 k l f h f and λ 2 k m f h f if all quadratic and cubic coupling terms are neglected for instance in the case of k 5 the relative error of underestimation will be 1 0 9369 5 2 15 if only the cubic coupling term is neglected the underestimation will be 1 0 9798 5 2 5 if coupling terms involving hf are neglected the underestimation will be 1 0 9583 5 2 10 herein we define a characteristic quantity named equivalent 2 k order spectral moment to judge the accuracy of each spectral method as compared to that of the time domain rfc method from a spectral moment view the expression is as follows 47 λ 2 k e q d 2 π c 2 3 k 2 γ 1 k 2 2 k table 5 gives the equivalent 2 k order spectral moments of the sm dirlik tb and proposed methods in case 1 as well as the quantity of rfc method evidently the result of the proposed method approaches that of the rfc method with the smallest deviation furthermore the equivalent spectral moments decrease with the increase of k from 3 to 6 but the rfc fatigue damage associated with large k is significantly higher in case 1 2 the frequency ratios γ lf hf of hf to mf are 9 while in cases 3 4 they are 6 as the hf mode is closer to the mf mode similar to case 1 case 3 examines the situation with equal vanmarcke bandwidth parameters δ lf δ mf δ hf 0 05 while case 4 examines the situation with equal spectral densities but distinct bandwidth parameters δ lf 0 05 δ mf 0 0167 δ hf 0 0084 the errors of spectral methods relative to rfc results are reported in table 6 not surprisingly the proposed method again stands out as the best approach both in case 3 and case 4 all relative errors do not exceed 2 1 when cross mode couplings are accounted for in case 4 mf and hf modes stand closer than the situation in case 1 2 so that the total vanmarcke bandwidth parameter δ 0 5249 is smaller than those of cases 1 2 δ 0 6188 0 6173 the performance of the sm method and the dirlik method behave well with all relative errors lower than 10 however it is found that when k is larger than 4 the errors of the tb method are still very large it reveals that the coefficient b app proposed by tovo and benasciutti cannot accurately catch the quantile point of the rfc damage which is between lc damage and rm damage when k is large 5 1 2 trimodal processes with wb lf and wb mf modes in engineering practice the frequency modes in a trimodal stress spectrum is not necessarily an ideal nb process in case 5 the lf mode is wb while in case 6 the mf mode is wb in case 7 both lf and mf are wb in these 3 cases the hf mode is still nb the calculated errors of fatigue damage by the four spectral methods are listed in table 7 for all three cases it is evident that the sm dirlik and tb method underestimate the fatigue damage when k 3 the underestimations caused by the three methods are all less than 10 in which the underestimation of by the tb method is around 5 5 however when k 6 the underestimations of these three methods become pronounced the respective relative errors are around 18 19 and 23 by comparison the proposed trimodal method performs much better than these two methods with the majority of relative errors less than 1 1 the only exception is k 6 in case 5 in which the relative error is only 1 9 still significantly lower than those by the sm and dirlik methods 5 2 trimodal processes comprising wb hf mode the toughest issue is probably the trimodal problem with a wb hf mode literature works on this problem is limited even if the process is of gaussian characteristics as shown in table 1 in cases 8 11 all hf modes are wb as its vanmarcke bandwidth parameter is 0 2774 lf and mf modes in case 8 are nb in case 9 only mf mode is nb in case 10 only lf is nb in case 11 all modes are wb fig 10 shows the spectra of cases 8 11 notice that in case 11 the three modes are neighboring and step wise table 8 gives the errors of fatigue damage estimated by spectral methods relative to those by time domain rfc evaluation in each case the accuracy subject to the number of sub modes is also investigated by m 1 2 m 1 corresponds to the situation without sub mode decomposition errors by the sm method all exceed 23 when k 6 by contrast the dirlik method is relatively robust because all errors are no more than 17 errors of tb method are small about 5 when k 3 however when k 5 and 6 errors are significant over 16 these three methods therefore significantly underestimate the fatigue damage obviously the proposed method is again the best method generating lowest relative errors even if hf mode is not decomposed with m 1 the maximum relative error is 8 62 in case 8 and k 6 such underestimation disappears when two sub modes are used with m 2 and cross mode couplings the proposed spectral method is so accurate that all relative errors are smaller than 1 in cases 8 11 and k 3 4 5 even for k 6 the maximum relative error is lower than 4 therefore m 2 is recommended for use when hf mode is wb it is also of interest to look into the respective contributions of spectral moments eq 32 in wb hf cases case 8 is selected to be the representative as it distinguishes from case 1 only in the bandwidth of hf mode the results are exposed in table 9 it can be seen that λ 2 k l f λ 2 k m f and λ 2 k l f m f are identical to those in table 4 as lf and mf components are actually the same in case 1 and case 8 λ 2 k h f still occupies the largest proportion which decreases when k increases moreover different from case 1 contributions from λ 2 k l f h f are positive indicating that coupling is affected by the bandwidth of hf mode in table 10 the equivalent 2 k order spectral moments of all approaches for case 8 are presented comparing table 10 with table 5 it is found that when hf mode changes from nb to wb but with identical variance the equivalent spectral moment of rfc slightly increases so is the spectral moment by the proposed spectral method the dirlik method and the tb method correspondingly the rfc damage in the last column of table also increases when k 6 the increase is about 48 1338 45 6473 1 5 45 in the conventional understanding when a random process changes from nb to wb but with same power the corresponding fatigue damage will be reduced wirsching and light 1980 rychlik 1993 this is evidenced by the smaller damage assessed by the sm method table 10 however it can be seen from the present case studies this assertion is no longer valid for the multimodal cases in that there exist coupling effects when hf mode itself becomes wb the cross mode coupling would make the fatigue damage larger this is a significant difference between the unimodal problem and the multimodal problem that should be handled carefully 5 3 case 12 a trimodal spectrum in ocean engineering in case 12 a response power spectrum see fig 11 of a catenary moored 5 mw spar wind turbine given in the reference karimirad and moan 2011b is adopted as an engineering example to discuss the practical application of the proposed method this 5 mw spar wind turbine is a well known prototype and has been studied by numerous research works karimirad and moan 2011b jonkman and musial 2010 nielsen et al 2006 the calculated spectrum shown in fig 10 is for the bending moment of the spar tower at the tower spar interface when a harsh ocean wave condition is considered significant wave height of 14 4 m and peak wave period of 13 3s obviously the bending moment is a typical trimodal process the three peak frequencies in spectrum are at 0 18 rad s 0 48 rad s and 2 4 rad s respectively corresponding to the pitch natural frequency of the spar the wave frequency and the 1st tower elastic mode frequency the vanmarcke bandwidth δ of this spectrum is around 0 7 implying a very wide banded random process as stated by karimirad and moan 2011b the bending moment is close to gaussian since skewness and kurtosis are 0 12 and 3 07 and the simulated extreme value for up crossing rate of 10 3 after normalization is 3 52 it is worth mentioning that if the ochi s refinement ochi 1973 for wb gaussian processes is used the extreme value of 3 62 can be derived which is merely 2 8 higher thus the bending moment in fig 11 and induced stress are almost perfect random processes for the trimodal gaussian fatigue evaluation to apply the proposed trimodal fatigue method the frequency ranges of lf mf and hf modes are defined fig 11 i e the lf mode is from 0 01 rad s to 0 3 rad s the mf mode is from 0 3 rad s to 1 5 rad s and the hf mode is from 1 5 rad s to 3 rad s these frequency ranges are identified by the saddle point 0 3 rad s and 1 5 rad s between any two neighboring principal frequencies the hf mode is further divided into two sub modes because this mode has a much larger frequency range than the lf mode the details of all the three modes after demarcation are given in table 11 for benchmark gaussian time series for rfc method are generated by fft of the spectrum in fig 11 these gaussian time series totally comprise 106 lf stress cycles to ensure convergence of the rfc result table 12 lists the relative error of each spectral method from table 12 it can be seen that like preceding case studies on rectangular spectra both the sm method and the dirlik method greatly underestimate the fatigue damage the accuracy of these two methods becomes worse when the spectral energy is dominated by mf and hf modes see table 11 tb method provides the most accurate result when k 3 but in other situations of k this method is not accurate on the contrary with a sub mode decomposition m 2 the proposed method renders very accurate fatigue estimations the relative errors for k 3 4 5 6 are all lower than 1 1 it is emphasized that the proposed method is not only accurate but also straightforward to be coded and computed therefore it has a great potential for many engineering applications moreover it deserves to be mentioned when the hf mode is not decomposed m 1 the proposed method is the most accurate method when k is larger than 3 6 conclusion in a prior work gao and zheng 2019 a state of the art spectral discretization method has been developed to evaluate the fatigue damage of bimodal gaussian processes the main originality of the method lies in importing a coupling term i e λ 2 k l f h f with a coefficient ξ to modify the spectral moments so that the coupling between lf and hf modes can be reflected the excellence of this bimodal method in accuracy has been validated in most of bimodal situations as this method is also numerically efficient it is of interest to extend the method to the more sophisticated trimodal problems to fulfill the objective the expression of 2 k order spectral moments is reformulated to reflect the cross couplings among lf mf and hf frequencies eq 32 correspondingly ξ l f m f ξ m f h f ξ l f h f are involved in the reformulation to reflect the degree of quadratic couplings and they can be calculated straightforward using the algorithm already established in the bimodal method the contribution by cubic coupling is represented by a coefficient ξ l f m f h f in terms of a smart and rational multiplication of ξ l f m f ξ m f h f and ξ l f h f see eq 36 the inspiration comes from the high order wave perturbation theory ohyama et al 1995 furthermore to deal with wb hf problems a refined algorithm with hf decomposition is emphatically introduced the proposed spectral fatigue method is compared with the well known sm method dirlik method and tb method in 12 case studies their performances are judged by the error relative to rfc time domain result trimodal processes with ideal nb frequency modes cases 1 4 are investigated first other combinations of lf mf and hf with nb and wb assumptions are also examined in cases 5 11 the results show that the sm method cannot capture cross mode couplings as the fatigue damage is significantly underestimated in all cases especially in wb hf cases cases 8 11 when the material parameter k is large k 5 or 6 the deviations all exceed 20 the dirlik method has similar performance to the sm method but its accuracy and robustness are better than the sm method in wb hf cases when k 6 its relative error is no more than 17 in general the sm method and the dirlik method seem inappropriate for trimodal problems especially for large k one reason is that these two methods are developed from a much wider and general set of psds while the trimodal spectra discussed herein are too specific for these early methods to be applied to say with the tb method it is fairly accurate in all cases of k 3 however when k is larger than 3 the induced errors increase dramatically when k 6 errors are larger than the sm method and the dirlik method in cases 1 7 with regard to the performances of the gm method and low method case 1 is analyzed the relative error of the gm method increases with the material parameter k more dramatically than the sm dirlik and tb methods its deviation is only 7 82 for k 3 but exceeds 40 for k 6 by contrast the low method is very accurate its relative errors in case 1 are all less than 2 however its theoretical formulation and equations are complicated and the required computation cost is expensive as the proposed spectral method is developed specifically for trimodal cases compared to all these spectral methods the proposed spectral method is not only accurate but also efficient and robust the suggested ξ l f m f h f is so reliable that in all situations the relative errors of the proposed method are considerably small in that many cases treated in this study most of errors are less than 1 in nb hf cases cases 1 7 the maximum error occurs in case 2 with k 6 and it is only 4 13 in wb hf cases cases 8 11 the maximum error is only 3 73 case 11 k 6 if the hf mode is decomposed into two sub modes at last in case 12 a case study using the bending moment of a floating spar wind turbine also affirms that the proposed method possesses a great potential in engineering applications the relative errors in this case study are all lower than 1 for k varying from 3 to 6 for the first time in a tri modal spectrum the respective contributions of lf mf and hf frequencies and their couplings to the overall fatigue damage can be differentiated case studies tables 4 and 9 also reveal that the hf mode plays one of the key roles in multimodal fatigue problems it has been demonstrated in case 1 that if all couplings involving hf are omitted the underestimation in fatigue damage will exceed 10 moreover even with identical hf s variance the resultant fatigue damage is affected by hf s bandwidth in the wb hf cases cases 8 11 decomposition of hf mode into two sub modes helps greatly enhance the accuracy fatigue damage prediction while the incurred additional computational effort is almost negligible besides the explicit formulation of cross mode couplings in this study allows for computer coding with ease it is therefore of great

21966,in ocean engineering the fatigue damage evaluation of structures subjected to random stress in the design stage is of great practical interest the stress can be a single mode bimodal or multi modal gaussian process traditional spectral methods used to focus on establishing a probabilistic model for the rainflow stress cycles to count the accumulation of damage recently authors have developed a state of the art bimodal spectral discretization method which crosses the border of traditional methods by introducing a coupling coefficient ξ to reflect the interaction between low and high frequency components the present study extends this accurate bimodal method to solve the more complicated trimodal gaussian problems a cubic coefficient is developed to account for cross mode couplings among low medium and high frequency components extensive comparisons with time domain rainflow counting method and traditional spectral methods are conducted to validate the high level of accuracy and efficiency of this trimodal method moreover via the proposed trimodal method the respective contributions of different frequencies and their couplings to the overall fatigue damage in a multi modal situation can be thoroughly differentiated comprehensive case studies including an analysis of a floating wind turbine have evidenced the important role of cross mode couplings in the total damage of fatigue keywords fatigue damage gaussian trimodal cross mode coupling spectral discretization 1 introduction fatigue life evaluation plays a crucial role at the design stage of an engineering structure especially for a structure who will experience harsh and cyclic environmental loadings in its service life since the early study of fatigue damage assessment the major attention has been on two issues i e one is the cycle counting of different levels of stress ranges and the other is the resultant fatigue damage from the counted cycles in the time domain analysis the cycle counting is straightforward and various methods were proposed for fatigue damage evaluation including peak counting level crossing counting range mean counting and rainflow counting rfc methods rychlik 1993 benasciutti and tovo 2006 among these methods the rfc method downing and socie 1982 has been widely accepted as the standard cycle counting method kumar and stathopoulos 1998 dnv 2006 in fatigue analysis for decades the success of the rfc method is due to its accurate capture of the largest stress cycles which are of most concern in fatigue evaluation after the cycle counting is obtained through the rfc the accumulated fatigue damage can be predicted by the well known s n curve of material and the linear palmgren miner rule miner 1945 when sufficiently long stress series are available the time domain rfc analysis for the fatigue evaluation is always the first choice regardless of level of non gaussianity and bandwidth in the time series however the time series data of stress from field or laboratory measurement is rather limited even in fem finite element method structural analysis the simulated response is not abundant as a large number of degree of freedoms and complex nonlinearities in the system impede fast calculation moreover the duration is long for instance to simulate the responses of an oil platform in a 6 h wave storm the time domain computational task is almost an impossible mission consequently a quick fatigue prediction turns to be an expensive expectation in the design stage the frequency domain analysis or so called spectral analysis is an alternative approach more often chosen by engineers when the stochastic stress process is narrow banded nb and gaussian its amplitudes follow the rayleigh distribution newland 2005 therefore the accumulated fatigue can be easily calculated by integrating the probabilistic function however when concerns move to wide banded wb processes the spectral method is somewhat powerless as the analytic solution of the rainflow stress cycles does not exist aiming to remove this barrier researchers began to establish different probabilistic models to match the rainflow amplitude distribution of a wb gaussian process studies by wirsching and light 1980 dirlik 1985 zhao and baker 1992 lutes and larsen 1990 benasciutti and tovo 2005 park et al 2014 to name some are very valuable in ocean engineering a marine structure always suffers the coupled action from environmental loadings like wind waves and currents fortunately in many situations the structural mass is very large and the stiffness is high so that the dynamic vibration system can be idealized as a linear filter between the loadings and the responses therefore the response spectrum exhibits multi modal characteristics but the level of non gaussianity of response is much lower than that of the environmental loadings zheng et al 2007 this is the underlying multi modal gaussian fatigue damage problem treated in the present study for a specific bimodal gaussian case which only includes two separated and distinguished peaks respectively corresponding to the low frequency lf mode and the high frequency hf mode in the spectrum jiao and moan 1990 developed a pioneering probabilistic frame for the fatigue assessment in the jiao moan jm method the total fatigue damage caused by a bimodal process is defined as the summation of the small cycle damage due to the hf component and the large cycle damage predominated by the envelope of the superimposed lf and hf components following the jm method a number of methods have been proposed to further improve the accuracy and efficiency in probabilistic fatigue assessment sakai and okamura 1995 fu and cebon 2000 low 2010 ma et al 2018 among these methods the low s low method is the most comprehensive but sophisticated one two effects are taken into account one is effect a corresponding to the overestimation of small cycle amplitudes in the jm method in that the presence of the lf process would diminish the amplitudes of the small cycles the other one is effect b understanding that the amplitude of a large cycle is smaller than the direct addition of the hf and lf amplitudes because the peaks of the lf and hf component processes have phase offsets hence in the low method phase variables are introduced to modify the amplitude distribution to eliminate these two effects the low s method has showed its remarkable accuracy in a number of studies low 2011 2014 however the complicated analytical solutions hinder its engineering applications so far the abovementioned spectral analysis methods all focus on establishing a probabilistic model for rainflow amplitudes of wb processes recently a novel spectral fatigue assessment method for bimodal processes has been developed by the authors gao and zheng 2019 the method starts from discretizing the spectrum into a large quantity of infinitesimal frequency bands first the accumulation fatigue of each band is then calculated according to the classical nb method by importing a coefficient ξ to further assemble these discretized fatigue damages this newly proposed method manages to capture the coupling effects between the lf and hf modes it has been proven to be more accurate than the single moment spectral method which employs the projection by projection pbp rule to obtain total damage benasciutti et al 2013 trimodal processes are more complex than bimodal processes as there are three distinct frequency regimes in the spectrum i e low frequency lf medium frequency mf high frequency hf realistic offshore structures like offshore compliant towers in deep water are driven by lf swell mf wind waves and hf morison forces karimirad and moan 2011a and a marine riser is excited by lf vessel motions mf wave loads and hf vortex induced vibration under ocean current gao and moan 2008 the quadratic coupling phenomenon would therefore exist between any two frequency components whereas the cubic coupling phenomenon among three frequency components is more intricate gao and moan the gm method extended the jiao moan method to tackle trimodal problems based on the theory of combined processes gao and moan 2008 the parametric studies of ideal trimodal processes showed that the developed trimodal formulation is satisfactory with the relative errors below 20 otherwise if the frequencies are not well separated or the lowest frequency component does not dominate the whole spectral energy the damage can be heavily overestimated with relative errors exceeding 50 low 2011 low also developed a trimodal spectral formulation low 2011 which claims to be more accurate than the gm method nevertheless low s trimodal formulation is not only mathematically more complicated than the bimodal formulation low 2010 but also demands very expensive computational cost hence its potential in engineering practice is rather limited as the extension of author s recent work on bimodal fatigue assessment this paper carries its objective to develop an accurate and straightforward method for the fatigue assessment of trimodal processes in the frequency domain different from a bimodal case couplings in a trimodal case are more complicated as the spectrum contains three principal frequency modes so that not only more quadratic couplings are involved but also a cubic coupling has to be considered in fatigue estimation comprehensive description interpretation and numerical formulation of inter modal couplings therefore become the major task of this study while the main novelty comes from devising trimodal coupling furthermore beyond accuracy and efficiency it is of great interest to fathom the importance of coupling effects among frequency modes this paper is organized as follows a brief introduction to the basic knowledge of spectral fatigue analysis method is given first it is followed by the summary of authors bimodal method after that the theory of the extended trimodal methods and case studies are exposed the results of case studies have validated both accuracy and robustness of the proposed method for the first time for a tri modal spectrum the respective contributions of lf mf and hf frequencies and their couplings to the overall fatigue damage can be differentiated in the end key findings are highlighted in the conclusion part 2 basics of spectral fatigue analysis when the structural stress x t is considered as a stationary gaussian process in the frequency domain its n th order spectral moment λ n can be readily calculated by the spectral density function g ω i e 1 λ n

estimated by 2 ν 0 1 2 π λ 2 λ 0 ν p 1 2 π λ 4 λ 2 in an ideal nb process ν 0 equals ν p to reflect the degree of the bandwidth of a process two familiar bandwidth parameters i e α m benasciutti and tovo 2007 and the vanmarcke parameter δ vanmarcke 1972 have been commonly used 3 α m λ m λ 0 λ 2 m m 1 2 3 4 δ 1 α 1 2 when the bandwidth of x t is infinitesimal α m and δ respectively approach 1 and 0 2 1 narrow band method though there is no rigorous criterion to demarcate nb and wb random processes in general cases of δ 0 1 are treated as nb for a nb gaussian process x t it is known that the amplitude r follows a rayleigh distribution 5 f r r r λ 0 exp r 2 2 λ 0 where λ 0 σ x 2 is the corresponding variance by invoking the palmgren miner linear damage accumulation rule and the s n curve the fatigue damage per unit time has the following closed form expression 6 d n b ν 0 c 2 2 λ 0 k γ 1 k 2 where c and k are both material parameters in s n curve and n c s k is the number of cycles to failure at the stress range s γ is gamma function 2 2 single moment sm method if the process is wb numerous approximate methods have been proposed to match the rainflow amplitude distribution two important methods are reviewed here one is the well known single moment sm method developed by larsen and lutes 1991 they used the generalized spectral moment of order 2 k to refine the rayleigh formulation in eq 6 i e 7 d s m 2 2 k 2 π c λ 2 k k 2 γ 1 k 2 this formula was empirical but was proven to be accurate in general wb cases larsen and lutes 1991 benasciutti and tovo 2006 including the bimodal spectrum with two close neighboring spectral peaks recently benasciutti et al 2013 provided a mathematical interpretation for the sm method from a spectral discretization view and it will be illustrated in detail in the following section 2 3 dirlik method another method was developed by dirlik 1985 and is widely used in engineering bouyssy et al 1993 low 2014 in this method the probabilistic distribution of the stress range s 2r is approximated as 8 f s s 1 2 σ x h 1 v e z v h 2 z h 2 e z 2 2 h 2 h 3 z e z 2 2 where z is the normalized stress range i e z s 2 σ x and 9 x m λ

x k h 1 v k γ 1 k 2 k 2 γ 1 k 2 h 2 h k h 3 2 4 tovo and benasciutti tb method tovo and benasciutti took the rule that rainflow damage is always bounded by level crossing lc counting and rang mean rm counting methods benasciutti and tovo 2005 2006 i e 11 d r m d r f c d l c and developed a method for general wb processes in terms of nb damage as follows benasciutti and tovo 2005 2006 12 d t b b t

obtained from a large amount of time domain simulations the simulations include five typical spectra and material parameter k 3 and 5 are considered however note that in eq 13 b tb is a function of spectral bandwidth parameters α 1 and α 2 only not linked to the material parameter k 3 spectral discretization methods for bimodal processes 3 1 bimodal processes as shown in fig 1 the spectral density function of a bimodal random process y t contains two separated bands respectively corresponding to the lf component x lf t and the hf component x hf t these two components are usually assumed probabilistically independent such that the time series of y t can be represented as 14 y t x l f t x h f t in fig 1 subscripts ub and lb respectively denote the upper bound and the lower bound of a frequency component the subscript chr denotes the characteristic frequency for rectangular spectra the characteristic frequency is the mid frequency i e ω c h r ω m i d the frequency ratio γ between the hf mode and lf mode is then defined as 15 γ h l ω c h r h f ω c h r l f correspondingly the power ratio or say variance ratio β is written as 16 β h l ω l b h f ω u b h f g ω d ω ω l b l f ω u b l f g ω d ω 3 2 spectral discretization technique works of benasciutti et al 2013 2016 provided a new idea called spectral discretization technique for fatigue assessment in the frequency domain they suggested that the stress power spectrum can be first discretized into a set of infinitesimal bands and each of them is assumed as an independent nb stochastic process of frequency ω i then the damage of each band is calculated through the rayleigh method as follow 17 d i ν 0 i c 2 2 λ 0 i k γ 1 k 2 where λ 0 i is the corresponding zero order spectral moment variance and ν 0 i ω i 2 π the total damage of the process is then summed up from fatigue damages of these infinitesimal bands according to a rational rule moreover benasciutti et al 2013 2016 suggested that the nonlinear assembly rule called projection by projection cristofori et al 2011 be used i e 18 d p b p i 1 n u m d i 2 k k 2 where num is the number of discretized bands combining eqs 17 and 18 the total damage is 19 d t o t a l d p b p i 1 n u m ω i 2 π c 2 2 g ω i δ ω k γ 1 k 2 2 k k 2 2 2 k 2 π c γ 1 k 2 i 1 n u m ω i 2 k g ω i δ ω k 2 2 2 k 2 π c γ 1 k 2 λ 2 k k 2 d s m thus the spectral discretization method with pbp rule is actually the discrete form of the famous sm formula in eq 7 when applying the spectral discretization method in practice the value of num needs to meet two criterions one is that the discretized bands should be sufficiently small to follow the rayleigh assumption the other one is that the calculation of the spectral moment from the discretized bands is sufficiently accurate 3 3 coupling effects in bimodal processes on the surface the pbp scheme in the sm method is a kind of nonlinear assembly rule however the interesting research by braccesi et al 2015 indicated that the sm formula ignores the coupling effects between different frequency components consider the variance of the summation of two random variables i e 20 w x y σ w 2 σ x 2 σ y 2 2 cov x y where w is the summation of variables x and y note that the covariance of x and y is involved to calculate σ w 2 inspired by eq 20 each discretized frequency band can be considered as a random variable and their spectral moments λ 0 i can be assumed to be variances if means are zeros these zero order spectral moments can be summed up like eq 20 and then substituted into the rayleigh formulation eq 6 to calculate the total damage fatigue braccesi et al 2015 suggested that before λ 0 i are summed up they should be normalized to have the same frequency i e 21 λ ˆ 0 i f i f ˆ 2 k λ 0 i in which f ˆ is the reference frequency and λ ˆ 0 i is the corresponding normalized zero order spectral moment in addition if λ ˆ 0 i are assumed to be mutually independent the normalized total zero order spectral moment is λ ˆ t o t a l i 1 n u m λ ˆ 0 i subsequently substituting λ ˆ t o t a l to eq 6 and calculating the total damage with ν 0 f ˆ leads to the identical form of the sm formula in eq 7 hence although the pbp scheme is a nonlinear rule the sm method ignores the correlations among the distinctive frequency components in the formulation this is the reason why the sm method might generate fatigue damage significantly deviating from the rfc result for bimodal processes the combination rule of the sm method in many situations cannot reasonably account for the fact that the hf frequency rides on the lf frequency and they are superimposed in the bimodal process to affect the overall fatigue damage however when γ hl 2 the sm method in eq 7 can provide good results as the bimodal coupling characteristics are insignificant and the process is more like a unimodal process 3 4 proposed bimodal method on the basis of eq 19 a new spectral discretization method is developed by authors gao and zheng 2019 to account for the interaction between lf and hf modes in bimodal processes after both lf and hf bands have been discretized into num infinitesimal nb bands the total fatigue damage is calculated through 22 d t o t a l 2 2 k 2 π c γ 1 k 2 λ 2 k l f λ 2 k h f λ 2 k l f h f k 2 23 λ 2 k l f i 1 n u m ω i l f 2 k g ω i l f δ ω l f 24 λ 2 k h f i 1 n u m ω i h f 2 k g

band and the hf band respectively the new incoming cross term λ 2 k l f h f reflects the coupling between lf and hf in λ 2 k l f h f a coefficient ξ is introduced to describe the degree of the coupling between the two modes specifically the coupling corresponding to any two discretized frequency bands ω i l f and ω i h f is denoted as ξ i i l f h f in eq 25 the coefficient ξ is a function of γ β k and its empirical expression is obtained through the nonlinear optimization technique combined with a comprehensive data set generated from monte carlo simulations in the reference paper gao and zheng 2019 a large number of combinations of γ β k are considered to cover a wide range of engineering problems the resultant expression shown in eq 26 is applicable to cases of γ 2 15 β 0 05 2 0 and k 3 9 26 ξ p 1 p 2 ln γ p 3 ln β p 4 ln γ 2 p 5 ln β 2 p 6 ln γ ln β 1 p 7 ln γ p 8 ln β p 9 ln γ 2 p 10 ln β 2 p 11 ln γ ln β where p u a 0 u a 1 u k a 2 u k 2 u 1 2 11 which are second order polynomials of k their coefficients a 0 u a 1 u and a 2 u are given in the appendix of reference gao and zheng 2019 it is straightforward to use eqs 22 26 in computer coding it has been validated through several case studies that even if ξ i i l f h f coupling of frequency bands is replaced by ξ l f h f coupling of modes lf and hf in eq 25 damage results of the same levels of accuracy can be still reached therefore 27 λ 2 k l f h f ξ l f h f i 1 n u m ω i l f 2 k g ω i l f δ ω l f ω i h f 2 k g ω i h f δ ω h f note that ξ l f h f is calculated through eqs 15 16 26 equation 27 is simpler than eq 25 but it pays more attention to the coupling between lf and hf modes obviously when lf and hf are ideal nb these two equations are identical discussions and case studies after this section are all based on eq 27 fig 2 illustrates the physical meanings of eqs 22 27 specifically when the hf mode in the bimodal process is wb the situation is only slightly more complicated by decomposing the hf mode into several hf sub modes c f gao and zheng 2019 for details 4 proposed trimodal method the principle of the newly developed bimodal method is to reflect coupling effects in the frequency domain eqs 22 27 by importing a cross term λ 2 k l f h f with coefficient ξ this principle is herein extended to trimodal cases with some smart improvement the trimodal process can be represented as 28 y t x l f t x m f t x h f t in which x m f t is the medium frequency mf component consider a rectangular trimodal gaussian process whose one side power spectrum is shown in fig 3 similar to bimodal cases some characteristic parameters are defined as 29 γ h l ω c h r h f ω c h r l f γ h m ω c h r h f ω c h r m f γ m l ω c h r m f ω c h r l f 30 β h l ω l b h f ω u b h f g ω d ω ω l b l f ω u b l

trimodal spectrum the cross mode couplings should account for the interactions between lf hf lf mf mf hf and lf mf hf similar to eq 22 the corresponding expression for trimodal cases is so rewritten as 31 d t o t a l 2 2 k 2 π c γ 1 k 2 λ 2 k t o t a l k 2 32 λ 2 k t o t a l λ 2 k l f λ 2 k m f λ 2 k h f λ 2 k l f m f λ 2 k l f h f λ 2 k m f h f λ 2 k l f m f h f in eq 32 terms λ 2 k l f and λ 2 k h f are identical to eqs 23 24 the addition λ 2 k m f is the 2 k order spectral moment of the medium frequency component which represents the individual fatigue damage from the mf mode the cross terms i e λ 2 k l f m f λ 2 k m f h f λ 2 k l f h f are from quadratic coupling effects and the term λ 2 k l f m f h f is of the cubic coupling effect expressions of these terms will be given in the next two sections to give a clearer understanding of eqs 31 32 a graphical representation is shown in fig 4 each mode is discretized into num frequency bands similar to the bimodal method when applying eqs 31 32 to evaluate the fatigue damage of a trimodal process the first step is to identify the hf component is nb or wb because the interaction mechanism is different in these two scenarios 4 1 trimodal cases with nb hf mode to dig out the characteristics of interactions in trimodal processes consider fig 5 where the time series of a trimodal gaussian process is shown in this process the lf mf and hf modes are all nb the lf component plays a role of carrier while both mf and hf components are superimposed on it almost all stress cycles are affected by the three frequency components simultaneously effects on the stress cycles due to the interactions of the different modes are versatile the interactions might lead to a very large stress cycle if the peaks of the three modes coincide in phase on the contrary if peaks and troughs coincide the resultant stress cycles are small as a result coupling effects must be taken seriously in analysis of multi modal processes equations 33 37 are the expressions of the terms in eq 32 for the nb hf cases 33 λ 2 k l f i 1 n u m s m i l f λ 2 k m f i 1 n u m s m i m f λ 2 k h f i 1 n u m s m i h f 34 λ 2 k l f m f ξ l f m f i

of ξ occurs in eq 35 i e ξ l f m f h f it is the coefficient reflecting the cubic coupling interactions among the three modes if the empirical fit of this coefficient is still via monte carlo simulations the number of simulations should be great and the fitted expression would become tedious and unstable after a lot of trial and errors the form in eq 36 which is sourced from the high order wave perturbation theory ohyama et al 1995 stands out to be the best option to account for trimodal couplings in the nb hf cases the feasibility and accuracy of eqs 33 37 are to be validated in later case studies 4 2 trimodal cases with wb hf mode in fig 6 a gaussian trimodal process with wb hf mode is illustrated different from fig 5 when the hf mode becomes wb the superimposed phenomenon is found to be more intricate and more irregular with many more small ripples on the profile several hf components ride on lf and mf cycles simultaneously in such a case the interactions between hf lf or between hf mf can no longer be regarded as one to one moreover the cubic coupling lf mf hf also becomes more complicated decomposition of wb hf mode into several sub modes less than 5 is necessary see gao and zheng 2019 the terms that related to hf mode in eq 32 i e λ 2 k l f h f λ 2 k m f h f and λ 2 k l f m f h f should be reformulated to reflect the wb hf effects fig 7 is the graphic illustration of the sub mode decomposition scheme developed for the trimodal process with wb hf component to calculate λ 2 k l f λ 2 k m f and λ 2 k l f m f eq 33 and eq 34 can still be applied however as the wb hf mode is decomposed into m sub modes λ 2 k h f is reformulated as 38 λ 2 k h f j 1 m λ 2 k j h f in which λ 2 k j h f is the 2 k spectral moment of the j th hf sub mode λ 2 k j h f is computed according to 39 λ 2 k j h f i 1 n u m s m j i h f where 40 s m j i h f ω j i h f 2 k g ω j i h f δ ω h f and ω j i h f denotes the i th discretized frequency band in the j th hf sub mode j 1 2 m each hf sub mode will interact with lf and mf modes thus for the j th sub mode we have 41 λ 2 k j l f h f ξ j l f h f i 1 n u m s m i l f s m j i h f m 42 λ 2 k j m f h f ξ j m f h f i 1 n u m s m i m f s m j i h f m the corresponding coefficient ξ j l f h f reflects the degree of the coupling effect between lf mode and the j th hf sub mode this coefficient is the function see eq 26 of frequency ratio γ j h l ω j c h r h f ω c h r l f and power ratio β j h l λ 0 j h f λ 0 l f where λ 0 j h f and λ 0 l f are zero order spectral moments of the j th hf sub mode and lf mode respectively see eq 1 similarly ξ j m f h f is the function of γ j h m ω j c h r h f ω c h r m f and β j h m λ 0 j h f λ 0 m f the associated terms λ 2 k l f h f and λ 2 k m f h f in eq 32 are then obtained by

flowchart is given in fig 8 5 case study since there exists a large number of combinations of power ratios and frequency ratios it is prohibitive to take all combinations into account it is preferable to study representative situations in the engineering practice totally 11 trimodal rectangular spectra and a practical engineering spectrum are discussed in this section the accuracy of the proposed trimodal method is compared with the well known sm method dirlik method and tb method in addition results of the gm method and the low method are compared in case 1 the time domain rfc result is used as benchmark reference the corresponding gaussian stress time series for rfc analysis are simulated by the fast fourier transform fft technique yang 1972 1973 zheng et al 2007 to ensure the convergence of simulations each stress time series comprises at least 1 million lf stress cycles and each hf stress cycle consists of at least 32 intervals as illustrated in table 1 each of the 11 cases has same power ratios among three frequency modes β lf mf β lf hf 1 and same characteristic frequency of lf component also among all cases the frequency ratio of mf to lf is identical γ lf mf 3 the differences come from two aspects one is the frequency ratio of hf to lf either 6 or 9 the other is spectral bandwidth parameter it can be seen from table 1 that cases 1 7 are nb hf with bandwidth parameter δ hf 0 05 while cases 8 11 are wb hf with δ hf 0 2774 note that 0 2774 is derived from α 1 0 9608 it also corresponds to α 2 0 8809 indicating a moderately wide banded spectrum in cases 1 4 as the bandwidth parameters of all three modes are so small all of them can be regarded as ideal nb these four cases are useful to uncover the fundamental characteristics of couplings in a trimodal process in addition the comparisons in this study also cover results of the gm method and the low method for case 1 all cases use s n parameters of c 1 normalized and k 3 4 5 6 5 1 trimodal processes comprising nb hf mode 5 1 1 trimodal processes of ideal nb modes fig 9 plots the two typical nb rectangular trimodal spectra in case 1 and case 2 in case 1 the three frequency modes are of the same vanmarcke bandwidth fig 9a δ lf δ mf δ hf 0 05 in case 2 the three frequency modes are of equal spectral density but distinct vanmarcke bandwidths fig 9b δ lf 0 05 δ mf 0 0167 δ hf 0 0056 tables 2 and 3 list the relative errors of all spectral methods when compared to the rfc method it is clear that the proposed method outperforms the sm method the dirlik method and the tb method in both case 1 and case 2 the relative errors of the proposed method are lower than 4 2 in all situations the deviations caused by the sm method the dirlik method and the tb method increase with the material parameter k especially in case 2 the deviations by these three methods both exceed 19 when k 6 in table 2 the results of the gm method and the low method see low 2011 are also given for case 1 for comparison it can be found that the accuracy of low method is very good and comparable to the proposed method when k 3 and 4 the proposed method behaves better than the low method with relative deviations to rfc less than 0 4 however the low method is complicated in computer coding and the computation is very time consuming by comparison the proposed method only requires one hundredth of a second to fulfill the computation effort among all spectral methods the performance of the gm method is obviously worst it dramatically underestimates the fatigue damage though the deviation for k 3 is less than 10 the deviations for k 5 and 6 exceed 30 the significant deviation might be caused by the so called effect a and effect b low 2010 which is ignored in jiao moan s bimodal method as the gm method was developed from jiao moan method such a drawback is inherited note that the low method and the gm method are more appropriate for nb modes thus their applicability to wb modes is limited the following comparisons and discussions will be carried out among the sm method the dirlik method the tb method and the proposed trimodal method in order to address the significance of cross mode couplings in the trimodal process the generalized 2 k order spectral moments due to different frequency components and their coupling effects i e λ 2 k in eq 32 are calculated the results of case 1 are listed in table 4 where the percentages correspond to the weights of each term relative to λ 2 k t o t a l in eq 32 it is obvious that the major contributions to the fatigue damage come from λ 2 k l f λ 2 k m f and λ 2 k h f among them λ 2 k h f has the largest proportion this explains why the traditional sm method in eq 7 can give good prediction results for many engineering problems especially for small k although the method actually ignores cross mode couplings but the weight from λ 2 k h f decreases with the increase of k for large k the total weight from lf and mf is greater than that of hf it is also noticeable that the weight of λ 2 k l f m f h f due to the cubic coupling effect is of the same order of magnitude as the quadratic coupling terms like λ 2 k l f m f λ 2 k l f h f and λ 2 k m f h f if all quadratic and cubic coupling terms are neglected for instance in the case of k 5 the relative error of underestimation will be 1 0 9369 5 2 15 if only the cubic coupling term is neglected the underestimation will be 1 0 9798 5 2 5 if coupling terms involving hf are neglected the underestimation will be 1 0 9583 5 2 10 herein we define a characteristic quantity named equivalent 2 k order spectral moment to judge the accuracy of each spectral method as compared to that of the time domain rfc method from a spectral moment view the expression is as follows 47 λ 2 k e q d 2 π c 2 3 k 2 γ 1 k 2 2 k table 5 gives the equivalent 2 k order spectral moments of the sm dirlik tb and proposed methods in case 1 as well as the quantity of rfc method evidently the result of the proposed method approaches that of the rfc method with the smallest deviation furthermore the equivalent spectral moments decrease with the increase of k from 3 to 6 but the rfc fatigue damage associated with large k is significantly higher in case 1 2 the frequency ratios γ lf hf of hf to mf are 9 while in cases 3 4 they are 6 as the hf mode is closer to the mf mode similar to case 1 case 3 examines the situation with equal vanmarcke bandwidth parameters δ lf δ mf δ hf 0 05 while case 4 examines the situation with equal spectral densities but distinct bandwidth parameters δ lf 0 05 δ mf 0 0167 δ hf 0 0084 the errors of spectral methods relative to rfc results are reported in table 6 not surprisingly the proposed method again stands out as the best approach both in case 3 and case 4 all relative errors do not exceed 2 1 when cross mode couplings are accounted for in case 4 mf and hf modes stand closer than the situation in case 1 2 so that the total vanmarcke bandwidth parameter δ 0 5249 is smaller than those of cases 1 2 δ 0 6188 0 6173 the performance of the sm method and the dirlik method behave well with all relative errors lower than 10 however it is found that when k is larger than 4 the errors of the tb method are still very large it reveals that the coefficient b app proposed by tovo and benasciutti cannot accurately catch the quantile point of the rfc damage which is between lc damage and rm damage when k is large 5 1 2 trimodal processes with wb lf and wb mf modes in engineering practice the frequency modes in a trimodal stress spectrum is not necessarily an ideal nb process in case 5 the lf mode is wb while in case 6 the mf mode is wb in case 7 both lf and mf are wb in these 3 cases the hf mode is still nb the calculated errors of fatigue damage by the four spectral methods are listed in table 7 for all three cases it is evident that the sm dirlik and tb method underestimate the fatigue damage when k 3 the underestimations caused by the three methods are all less than 10 in which the underestimation of by the tb method is around 5 5 however when k 6 the underestimations of these three methods become pronounced the respective relative errors are around 18 19 and 23 by comparison the proposed trimodal method performs much better than these two methods with the majority of relative errors less than 1 1 the only exception is k 6 in case 5 in which the relative error is only 1 9 still significantly lower than those by the sm and dirlik methods 5 2 trimodal processes comprising wb hf mode the toughest issue is probably the trimodal problem with a wb hf mode literature works on this problem is limited even if the process is of gaussian characteristics as shown in table 1 in cases 8 11 all hf modes are wb as its vanmarcke bandwidth parameter is 0 2774 lf and mf modes in case 8 are nb in case 9 only mf mode is nb in case 10 only lf is nb in case 11 all modes are wb fig 10 shows the spectra of cases 8 11 notice that in case 11 the three modes are neighboring and step wise table 8 gives the errors of fatigue damage estimated by spectral methods relative to those by time domain rfc evaluation in each case the accuracy subject to the number of sub modes is also investigated by m 1 2 m 1 corresponds to the situation without sub mode decomposition errors by the sm method all exceed 23 when k 6 by contrast the dirlik method is relatively robust because all errors are no more than 17 errors of tb method are small about 5 when k 3 however when k 5 and 6 errors are significant over 16 these three methods therefore significantly underestimate the fatigue damage obviously the proposed method is again the best method generating lowest relative errors even if hf mode is not decomposed with m 1 the maximum relative error is 8 62 in case 8 and k 6 such underestimation disappears when two sub modes are used with m 2 and cross mode couplings the proposed spectral method is so accurate that all relative errors are smaller than 1 in cases 8 11 and k 3 4 5 even for k 6 the maximum relative error is lower than 4 therefore m 2 is recommended for use when hf mode is wb it is also of interest to look into the respective contributions of spectral moments eq 32 in wb hf cases case 8 is selected to be the representative as it distinguishes from case 1 only in the bandwidth of hf mode the results are exposed in table 9 it can be seen that λ 2 k l f λ 2 k m f and λ 2 k l f m f are identical to those in table 4 as lf and mf components are actually the same in case 1 and case 8 λ 2 k h f still occupies the largest proportion which decreases when k increases moreover different from case 1 contributions from λ 2 k l f h f are positive indicating that coupling is affected by the bandwidth of hf mode in table 10 the equivalent 2 k order spectral moments of all approaches for case 8 are presented comparing table 10 with table 5 it is found that when hf mode changes from nb to wb but with identical variance the equivalent spectral moment of rfc slightly increases so is the spectral moment by the proposed spectral method the dirlik method and the tb method correspondingly the rfc damage in the last column of table also increases when k 6 the increase is about 48 1338 45 6473 1 5 45 in the conventional understanding when a random process changes from nb to wb but with same power the corresponding fatigue damage will be reduced wirsching and light 1980 rychlik 1993 this is evidenced by the smaller damage assessed by the sm method table 10 however it can be seen from the present case studies this assertion is no longer valid for the multimodal cases in that there exist coupling effects when hf mode itself becomes wb the cross mode coupling would make the fatigue damage larger this is a significant difference between the unimodal problem and the multimodal problem that should be handled carefully 5 3 case 12 a trimodal spectrum in ocean engineering in case 12 a response power spectrum see fig 11 of a catenary moored 5 mw spar wind turbine given in the reference karimirad and moan 2011b is adopted as an engineering example to discuss the practical application of the proposed method this 5 mw spar wind turbine is a well known prototype and has been studied by numerous research works karimirad and moan 2011b jonkman and musial 2010 nielsen et al 2006 the calculated spectrum shown in fig 10 is for the bending moment of the spar tower at the tower spar interface when a harsh ocean wave condition is considered significant wave height of 14 4 m and peak wave period of 13 3s obviously the bending moment is a typical trimodal process the three peak frequencies in spectrum are at 0 18 rad s 0 48 rad s and 2 4 rad s respectively corresponding to the pitch natural frequency of the spar the wave frequency and the 1st tower elastic mode frequency the vanmarcke bandwidth δ of this spectrum is around 0 7 implying a very wide banded random process as stated by karimirad and moan 2011b the bending moment is close to gaussian since skewness and kurtosis are 0 12 and 3 07 and the simulated extreme value for up crossing rate of 10 3 after normalization is 3 52 it is worth mentioning that if the ochi s refinement ochi 1973 for wb gaussian processes is used the extreme value of 3 62 can be derived which is merely 2 8 higher thus the bending moment in fig 11 and induced stress are almost perfect random processes for the trimodal gaussian fatigue evaluation to apply the proposed trimodal fatigue method the frequency ranges of lf mf and hf modes are defined fig 11 i e the lf mode is from 0 01 rad s to 0 3 rad s the mf mode is from 0 3 rad s to 1 5 rad s and the hf mode is from 1 5 rad s to 3 rad s these frequency ranges are identified by the saddle point 0 3 rad s and 1 5 rad s between any two neighboring principal frequencies the hf mode is further divided into two sub modes because this mode has a much larger frequency range than the lf mode the details of all the three modes after demarcation are given in table 11 for benchmark gaussian time series for rfc method are generated by fft of the spectrum in fig 11 these gaussian time series totally comprise 106 lf stress cycles to ensure convergence of the rfc result table 12 lists the relative error of each spectral method from table 12 it can be seen that like preceding case studies on rectangular spectra both the sm method and the dirlik method greatly underestimate the fatigue damage the accuracy of these two methods becomes worse when the spectral energy is dominated by mf and hf modes see table 11 tb method provides the most accurate result when k 3 but in other situations of k this method is not accurate on the contrary with a sub mode decomposition m 2 the proposed method renders very accurate fatigue estimations the relative errors for k 3 4 5 6 are all lower than 1 1 it is emphasized that the proposed method is not only accurate but also straightforward to be coded and computed therefore it has a great potential for many engineering applications moreover it deserves to be mentioned when the hf mode is not decomposed m 1 the proposed method is the most accurate method when k is larger than 3 6 conclusion in a prior work gao and zheng 2019 a state of the art spectral discretization method has been developed to evaluate the fatigue damage of bimodal gaussian processes the main originality of the method lies in importing a coupling term i e λ 2 k l f h f with a coefficient ξ to modify the spectral moments so that the coupling between lf and hf modes can be reflected the excellence of this bimodal method in accuracy has been validated in most of bimodal situations as this method is also numerically efficient it is of interest to extend the method to the more sophisticated trimodal problems to fulfill the objective the expression of 2 k order spectral moments is reformulated to reflect the cross couplings among lf mf and hf frequencies eq 32 correspondingly ξ l f m f ξ m f h f ξ l f h f are involved in the reformulation to reflect the degree of quadratic couplings and they can be calculated straightforward using the algorithm already established in the bimodal method the contribution by cubic coupling is represented by a coefficient ξ l f m f h f in terms of a smart and rational multiplication of ξ l f m f ξ m f h f and ξ l f h f see eq 36 the inspiration comes from the high order wave perturbation theory ohyama et al 1995 furthermore to deal with wb hf problems a refined algorithm with hf decomposition is emphatically introduced the proposed spectral fatigue method is compared with the well known sm method dirlik method and tb method in 12 case studies their performances are judged by the error relative to rfc time domain result trimodal processes with ideal nb frequency modes cases 1 4 are investigated first other combinations of lf mf and hf with nb and wb assumptions are also examined in cases 5 11 the results show that the sm method cannot capture cross mode couplings as the fatigue damage is significantly underestimated in all cases especially in wb hf cases cases 8 11 when the material parameter k is large k 5 or 6 the deviations all exceed 20 the dirlik method has similar performance to the sm method but its accuracy and robustness are better than the sm method in wb hf cases when k 6 its relative error is no more than 17 in general the sm method and the dirlik method seem inappropriate for trimodal problems especially for large k one reason is that these two methods are developed from a much wider and general set of psds while the trimodal spectra discussed herein are too specific for these early methods to be applied to say with the tb method it is fairly accurate in all cases of k 3 however when k is larger than 3 the induced errors increase dramatically when k 6 errors are larger than the sm method and the dirlik method in cases 1 7 with regard to the performances of the gm method and low method case 1 is analyzed the relative error of the gm method increases with the material parameter k more dramatically than the sm dirlik and tb methods its deviation is only 7 82 for k 3 but exceeds 40 for k 6 by contrast the low method is very accurate its relative errors in case 1 are all less than 2 however its theoretical formulation and equations are complicated and the required computation cost is expensive as the proposed spectral method is developed specifically for trimodal cases compared to all these spectral methods the proposed spectral method is not only accurate but also efficient and robust the suggested ξ l f m f h f is so reliable that in all situations the relative errors of the proposed method are considerably small in that many cases treated in this study most of errors are less than 1 in nb hf cases cases 1 7 the maximum error occurs in case 2 with k 6 and it is only 4 13 in wb hf cases cases 8 11 the maximum error is only 3 73 case 11 k 6 if the hf mode is decomposed into two sub modes at last in case 12 a case study using the bending moment of a floating spar wind turbine also affirms that the proposed method possesses a great potential in engineering applications the relative errors in this case study are all lower than 1 for k varying from 3 to 6 for the first time in a tri modal spectrum the respective contributions of lf mf and hf frequencies and their couplings to the overall fatigue damage can be differentiated case studies tables 4 and 9 also reveal that the hf mode plays one of the key roles in multimodal fatigue problems it has been demonstrated in case 1 that if all couplings involving hf are omitted the underestimation in fatigue damage will exceed 10 moreover even with identical hf s variance the resultant fatigue damage is affected by hf s bandwidth in the wb hf cases cases 8 11 decomposition of hf mode into two sub modes helps greatly enhance the accuracy fatigue damage prediction while the incurred additional computational effort is almost negligible besides the explicit formulation of cross mode couplings in this study allows for computer coding with ease it is therefore of great

21967,the pull out resistance of single belled anchors and non linear slip surfaces in two different layered sand deposits in respect to embedment ratios diameter ratios and bell angles are evaluated from experimental study the predicted pull out resistances are computed by horizontal slice method applied on observed slip surfaces from the dyed and non dyed layers of sand deposits the models can achieve higher pull out resistance for higher embedment ratios lesser diameter ratios and bell angles in both the sand deposits the 45 54 and 63 belled anchors are efficient to resist pull out loads than 72 anchors the pull out resistance are correlated with respective slip surfaces based on embedment ratios width ratios and bell angles the slip surfaces are concave inward and upward and convex outward and upward in pattern based on sand deposits total 93 predicted results are within 10 72 to 09 83 variations comparison to observed data numerical analysis for comparatively larger models based on plaxis 3d foundation are found to closely following the similar trend of non dimensional pull out resistance and non linear behaviour of slip surfaces of small scale 1 g laboratory models the non dimensional pull out resistance obtained from plaxis 3d foundation analysis are within 2 15 to 8 45 variation comparison to the observed data keywords pull out resistances belled anchors non linear slip surfaces layered sand horizontal slice method dyed sand layers 1 introduction anchors have been used as a common part of substructure in both marine and land structures primarily to resist tensile loads as well as against overturning moments off shore structures like dolphins jetty and wharf structures are continuously subjected to thrust of wind storm and hurricanes produce a cyclic wave fluctuation in water level thrust and pull of the berthing ships and sometimes thrust of thick sheets of moving ice carried out by the tide the pipe lines used for transporting oil and gas under sea water is often subjected to considerable magnitudes of uplift forces so in such situation the provision of anchors are mandatory the intensive explorations of hydrocarbons in deep sea need for large off shore structures anchor is a convenient and conventional method of foundation construction for works under water table and coastal shore structures such as underground pumping station oil storage tanks and buildings having several underground floors in coastal areas in radar tower television tower power pole road side sign posts and out door sign pools imbalance horizontal forces are mostly due to severe wind velocity in the design of silos overhead water tank and tall chimneys overturning loads as well as associated moment considerations are one of the most important issues previous researchers have well documented the efficiency of belled and plate anchors against uplift in dry homogeneous sand but limited researches have been done on uplift behaviour of plate anchors in layered sand the pull out resistance of model belled anchors is significantly affected by embedment ratios bell angles and diameter ratios in homogeneous sand bed dickin and leung 1990 1992 ghosh and bera 2010 bera and banerjee 2013 bera 2014 nazir et al 2014 previous studies on circular plate anchors having different sizes buried at different embedment depth are also available sujatha and balamurugan 2014 balla 1961 meyerhof and adams 1968 clemence and veesaert 1977 murray and geddes 1987 sujatha and balamurugan 2014 and krishnaswamy and parashar 1994 for a homogeneous dense sand bed it was assumed that in analytical models of non linear slip surfaces net ultimate pull out resistance was derived as the summation of the weight of breakout sand within the slip surfaces and mobilised shear along slip surfaces downs and chieurzzri 1966 matsuo 1968 vermeer and sutjiadi 1985 chattopadhyay and pise 1986 deb and pal 2018 ghaly and hanna 1994 murray and geddes 1987 rao and kumar 1994 saeedy 1987 vanitha et al 2007 rowe and davis 1982 developed an elasto plastic finite element approach for predicting load displacement behaviour of anchors pulled vertically pull out resistance problem of horizontal anchors in sand using non linear finite element code was studied by basudhar and singh 1994 rajesh and shreni 2014 and cerfontaine et al 2019 berghe et al 2006 and dickin and laman 2007 also used the 2d plaxis analysis for plat anchor in homogeneous sand deposit very few experimental studies on pull out resistance of circular plate anchor are available in layered sand bouazza and finlay 1990 and sakai and tanaka 2007 the upper and lower bound theorem of limit analysis in combination with finite element method to compute uplift resistance of plate anchors in two layered sand deposits were studied by sakai and tanaka 2007 kouzer and kumar 2009 and bhattacharya and kumar 2016 the details of the failure mechanism in layered sand bed are documented on the basis of velocity hydrograph kumar 2003 rigid block collapse mechanism in combination of upper bound theorem of limit analysis sahoo and ganesh 2018 and plain strain and axisymmetric lower bound limit analysis with the combination of finite elements and linear optimisation bhattacharya and kumar 2016 till date there is a dearth of experimental and numerical study to understand the variations in the pull out resistance of belled anchors and failure mechanisms in the different layered sand deposits this still needs for more attention to have a clear understanding the presently available limited previous studies on pull out resistance as well as analytical models are insufficient enough to correlate the variation in pull out resistance due to changes in the pattern of slip surface in different layered sand deposits in connection with various parameters 2 failure mechanisms the breakout wedge is progressive in nature from the edge of anchor base to sand surface as loading is gradually transferred from anchor to the surrounding sand and hence there are changes in the state of stresses in different locations within zone of breakout sand the breakout sand within the slip surfaces is developed at the same velocity as that is the upward velocity of the anchor kumar 2003 in the early stage of applied upward pull with an upward displacement of anchor the total stresses underneath the anchor base start to gradually decrease and at the same time there is a simultaneous increase of total stress immediately above the anchor base and this circumstance continues till the complete generation of breakout sand zone is occurred at the first phase of uplift loading the sand at the nearest zone of anchor base displaces with the upward displacement of anchor and at the same time there is the opening of cavity underneath the anchor base with the increase in pulling simultaneously the cavity is enlarged in the compressed zone the sand is locked up and there is higher interlocking among the sand particles above the anchor base than rolling and sliding ilamparuthi and muthukrishnaiah 1999 the locked up sand near anchor base help to produce an extensive plastic zone of collapse rowe and davis 1982 with continuous pulling the cavity is expanded and the level of shear stress in the sand near the anchor base is rose gradually to attain shear strength of sand in this study it is also observed that the failure surfaces are started to generate from the edge of anchor base and progressively move above the anchor base towards sand surface with gradually higher horizontal extension this phenomenon is due to the dilatancy of sand rowe and davis 1982 at the fully collapsed stage the plastic flow of sand surrounding the anchor base moves downward to fill the void at the verge of failure the tension cracks produced in sand around the base are responsible for plastic flow to progress downward to fill the voids and at that moment shear strength is fully mobilised it has been assumed that due to pull out of anchor earth pressure of within the breakout sand domain transformed from semi active condition to passive condition matsuo 1968 3 aim of the present study this experimental study attempts to investigate the comparison of i non dimensional pull out resistance of model belled anchors and ii respective slip surfaces in both the sides of panels based on two different types of layered sand deposits with a variation of a few embedment ratios and anchor properties an attempt is made to find out the significant models based on foundation media on observed slip surfaces horizontal slice method is applied to predict pull out resistance the reason behind the variations in predicted pull out resistance in different layered sand deposits are correlated with respective slip surfaces based on embedment ratios bell angles and width ratios diameter ratios in this study it is also intended to outline the similarities between the experimental and numerical by finite element analysis in plaxis 3d foundation non dimensional pull out resistance and non linear failure surfaces in both the layered sand deposits 4 sand model belled anchors panels and model tank two different kinds of dry sands are used to characterize the layered foundation beds and these are designated as sand 1 s1 and sand 2 s2 fig 1 presents the grain size distribution of s1 and s2 samples the calibrated placement density of s1 and s2 are 15 60 and 16 90 kn m3 respectively the densities of s1 and s2 are achieved by raining technique dickin and leung 1990 and bouazza and finlay 1990 using soil tray and calibrated height of soil tray is fixed at 700 mm in both the cases there is no possibility of segregation of sand particles in the rain fall technique in table 1 it is noticed that the γ2 and ϕ2 in s2 are higher than γ1 and ϕ1 of s1 so s2 is stronger than s1 for the present experimental conditions for the 1 g laboratoy model the bell and shaft parts are made up from rounded solid bar and both the parts are joined by internal welding the hollow panels are made up from 1 mm thick steel plates the ws and wb are identical to ds and db respectively the db and wb are constant at 26 mm the height of models and panels is fixed at 650 mm the lengths of panels are 590 2 5 mm the detailing of β ds db or ws wb l db or l wb are listed in table 2 columns i to iii at top of each 3d model and at mid length of each panel a grooving arrangement is provided to grip the proving ring gently on the outer part of grooving arrangement a couple of flat steel strips are welded so that the dial gauges can rest on them tenderly at 180 apart from each other the inner area of the model testing tank is 700 mm length 600 mm width 700 mm height the tank is supported by a steel frame and its four sides are enclosed by pieces of plaxi glass of 12 mm thick few steel stiffeners are vertically welded with the frame the sheets of plaxi glass are bolted with stiffeners and frame to prevent the sheet from deflecting outward the size of the testing tank is adequate to avoid the boundary effects 4 1 sand bed preparation for 3d models and panels in the beginning a 100 mm thick dry compacted sand bed is well prepared with horizontal surface and model or panel is placed over it before the preparation of foundation media either s1 s2 or s2 s1 in order to prepare s1 s2 deposit the bed of s2 having a certain thickness l s2 ʹ of 168 mm is made and over s2 s1 is poured up to the predetermined height l s1 ʹʹ to attain desired total embedment depth the ratios of l s1 ʹʹ l and l s2 ʹ l are listed in table 2 columns iv and v the s2 s1 deposit is similarly prepared the ratios of l s2 ʹʹ l and l s1 ʹ l are listed in table 2 columns viii and ix in order to ensure the uniformity of sand density within the testing tank six wooden boxes of 100 cc are sited in the corners of the tank in different locations the variations in local densities of s1 and s2 among these boxes are found within 1 only to study the slip surfaces in both the sides of panels in s1 s2 media successive layers of green dyed sand having 3 mm thickness and non dyed sand i e s2 having 18 mm thickness is poured up to height of 168 mm l s2 ʹ and similarly the overlying layer of s1 is prepared by red dyed and non dyed sand maintaining the same thickness to prepare the s2 s1 media successive layers of 3 mm thick red dyed and 18 mm thick non dyed sand s1 is poured up to a height of 168 mm l s1 ʹ and following a similar approach the overlying deposit of s2 is prepared by green dyed and non dyed sand s2 the regularity of sand density is checked for dyed and non dyed sand layers also as already discussed 4 2 experimental programme to perform an experimental study on the pull out resistance of single belled anchors and failure pattern in layered sand deposits in both the sides of panels a couple of conditions are considered and explained below series a experimental study on pull out resistance vs model displacement relationship for models installed to attain l db of 3 4 and 5 having db ds of 0 28 0 33 0 38 and 0 46 and possessing β of 45 54 63 and 72 in s1 s2 and s2 s1 deposit in total 3 4 4 2 96 numbers of tests are performed series b experiments and observations on failure mechanism of sand deposits in both the sides of panels installed to attain l tb of 3 4 and 5 having ws wb of 0 28 0 33 0 38 and 0 46 and possessing β of 45 54 63 and 72 in s1 s2 and s2 s1 deposit in total 3 4 3 2 96 numbers of tests are performed 4 3 experimental set up and methodology the fig 2 presents the schematic view of the experimental set up in laboratory the loading frame is fabricated from steel channels and its top horizontal beams act as reaction frame the base of the loading frame is bolted with a concrete beam for stability there is a vertical pulling shaft act as long screw and can freely move upward and downward direction through the nut arrangement the nut arrangement is welded at the centre of horizontal beams and the nut possesses ball bearing arrangement the model is connected with the bottom of the pulling shaft via proving ring the vertical movement of the shaft is controlled by manually rotating circular wheel connected with nut arrangement the upward displacements of the anchors are controlled by clockwise rotation of the wheel two dial gauges 0 01 mm accuracy are attached properly with magnetic bases and are fitted on a couple of steel bar laid over the top of the testing tank the proving ring 1 0 kn capacity response demonstrates the gross pull out load on models and corresponding upward displacement of the anchors are recorded from the reading of both the dial gauges 5 model panel and slip surface designations in table 2 columns i ii iii vi vii ix and x the particulars of models are presented for both kind of layered sand to represent a model and panel a common coding system consist of four parts is used the first second third and fourth parts illustrate the type m or p β ds db or ws wb l db or l wb respectively as presented in table 2 columns iv and v the symbol m 63 0 28 5 implies that a model is having β 63 ds db 0 28 and buried at l db 5 and the replicate panel is identified as p 63 0 28 5 in the detail designation of a model the fifth part illustrates the percentages of thickness of the sand i e either s1 or s2 in the bottom and top layer respectively when a model is belonging to β of 63 ds db of 0 33 at l db of 4 its 53 of total l is in top layer s1 and 47 of total l is in bottom layer s2 respectively then it is denoted by m 63 0 33 4 0 53s1 0 47s2 the replicate slip surfaces are also presented in a similar manner in table 3 columns iv and vii the symbol ss 45 0 28 3 0 61s2 0 39s1 implies that the slip surface is developed in the side of panel p 45 0 28 3 having β of 45 ws wb of 0 28 and attains l wb of 3 and its 61 of total l is in top layer s2 and 39 of total l is in the bottom layer s1 6 observations on experimental results 6 1 observations on load displacement behaviour from physical modelling the fig 3 a and b illustrate typical curves of net pull out resistance vs model displacement relationship for the models m 45 0 33 and m 63 0 28 respectively in both the layered sand deposits the patterns of net pull out resistance vs model displacement curves are not similar for both layered sand media in s1 s2 deposit in very early stage the curves are linear showing true elastic response and afterwards the curves take the form of pseudo elastic pattern resemble the curvilinear shape and ultimately produces elasto plastic response with hasty growth of the plastic region as well as the highest rate of deformation this may be due to the reason that as the load is transferred from anchor to the sand of bottom layer s2 break it at comparatively higher force and when load started to transfer in the comparatively weaker top layer s1 less force is required to break that one a similar pattern of relationship in uplift load vs displacement curves is available in layered sandy deposit bouazza and finlay 1990 in s2 s1 deposit in general more or less curvilinear shape is achieved in net pull out resistance vs model displacement curve up to the layer of si and after that in all curves there is a sudden higher rate of increment in pull out resistance at a very lower rate of upward displacement this may be due to the reason that as the load is transferred from anchor to the sand of bottom layer s1 break it at comparatively lower force and when load started to transfer in the top layer s2 of comparatively higher strength more force is required to break it this pattern of behaviour is most prominent when the thickness of s2 is less than s1 similar tendency in the relationship of uplift load vs anchor displacement curves for circular plate anchors embedded in soft clay underlain by dense sand is documented stewart 1985 in both cases at ultimate or collapsed stage strength mobilization is lower than the rate of increment in vertical displacement observed net ultimate pull out resistance qu is always reported as self weight subtracted from the gross uplift capacity the embedment depth anchor and bulk density of foundation media are primary parameters in the uplift resistance problem so these parameters are used to non dimensional the uplift resistance data the normal pull out resistance i e breakout factor nu s1 s2 and nu s2 s1 is always presented as 1 n u s 1 s 2 q u s 1 s 2 a b γ 1 l s 1 γ 2 l s 2 2 n u s 2 s 1 q u s 2 s 1 a b γ 1 l s 2 γ 2 l s 1 6 2 observations on non linear slip surfaces from physical modelling the typical fig 4 a and b and c show the typical view of slip surfaces ss 45 0 33 4 0 47s1 0 53s2 ss 72 0 38 4 0 38s1 0 62s2 and ss 63 0 38 4 0 38s1 0 62s2 in both the sides of panel p 45 0 33 p 72 0 38 and p 63 0 38 respectively the typical fig 5 a and b and c present the typical view of slip surfaces ss 63 0 38 4 0 38s2 0 62s1 ss 72 0 33 4 0 47s2 0 53s1 and ss 54 0 28 3 0 39s2 61s1 in both the sides of panel p 63 0 38 ss 72 0 33 and p 54 0 28 respectively the breakout wedge is started from the edge of anchor base gradually progress upward and terminated to sand surface so in this present study for embedment ratios of 3 4 and 5 at ultimate load a shallow anchor exhibits general shear failure pattern at collapse stage failure appears up to the sand surface and the break out sand mass above the anchor base bounded by the slip surface is subjected to strain which is the only category of shallow anchor the failure mechanism is similar in both the sand beds in this present study two different pattern in slip surfaces can be noticed concavity inward and upward in s1 s2 deposit and convexity outward and upward in s2 s1 deposit at the sand surface lateral extent of failure point is maximum in both the sand bed and denoted by xmax s1 s2 and xmax s2 s1 in fig 4 a and b and c for s1 s2 deposit the tendency of failure points to spread in the top layer i e s1 is lesser compared to those failure points as appeared in the bottom layer i e s2 it has been calculated that the βa s1 s2 values are within the range of 15 95 19 65 for 45 54 and 63 panels and within the range of 10 78 13 39 for 72 panels hence in general the βf s1 s2 values are within the range of 25 02 to 19 09 for 45 54 and 63 panels and within the range of 10 78 13 39 for 72 panel in figs 5 a b and c for s2 s1 deposit the tendency of failure points in the top layer i e s2 to spread is higher compared to those failure points appeared in the bottom layer i e s1 it has been calculated that the βa s2 s1 values are within the range of 12 09 15 95 for 45 54 and 63 panels and within the range of 08 13 10 78 for 72 panels in general βa s2 s1 values are within the range of 32 74 50 19 for 45 54 and 63 panels and the βf s2 s1 values are within the range of 25 46 34 22 for 72 panels here the differences between βa s2 s1 and βf s2 s1 are at least 10 which reveal the nonlinearity of slip surfaces this type of diversity in the behaviour of slip surfaces generated in s1 s2 and s2 s1 deposit is due to differences in the values of γ and ϕ of s1 and s2 a similar pattern in slip surfaces in layered sand deposits are also found in previous studies using shear bend propagation by linear slip surfaces sakai and tanaka 2007 the collapse mechanism by velocity hydrograph kumar 2003 and rigid block collapse mechanism bhattacharya and kumar 2016 7 analysis of predicted breakout factors using the horizontal slice method the failure points as obtained in both the sides of panels can pretend around the model anchors same scale as a axisymmetric solid body three dimensional of sand the panels as well as generated breakout sand zone within the slip surfaces are symmetric along the vertical axis the midpoint of the panel base is considered as the origin 0 0 the failure points at every 21 mm height from the anchor base and deformed point in the dyed layers are presented in a coordinate system as demonstrated in fig 4 a b and c and 5 a b and c in both the type of layered sand deposits on the basis of identified coordinates of failure points the numbers and dimensions of horizontal slices each having 21 mm δy thick are obtained the elemental forces acting on slice wedge is presented by free body diagram as shown in figs 6 and 7 for s1 s2 and s2 s1 deposit respectively the method of elastic analysis is explained below 7 1 predicted breakout factors in s1 s2 deposit a disc wedge in the form of truncated cone of thickness δy at a height of yi and yj above the anchor base contained between the axysymmetric failure surface is considered in fig 6 the elementary forces acting on the wedge are shown in this figure the domain outside the failure zone is in rest condition so the normal force on the failure surface of the failure wedge corresponds to lateral earth pressure at rest at the collapsed stage in state of limit equilibrium of soil according to mohr coulomb failure principle the downward acting resultant vertical component of mobilised shear resistance on the outer area of for ith and jth i e tvi and tvj along the failure surface of length δli and δlj are evaluated as follows 3 t vi 2 γπ x i δx i 2 y i δy y i k 0 cos β i sin β i tan ϕ 4 t vj 2 γπδ y x j δx j 2 y j δy y j k 0 cos β j sin β j tan ϕ ko 1 sin ϕ earth pressure coefficient δ l i δ y cos β i lateral length in i th slice and δ l j δ y cos β j lateral length in j th slice as no shear stress is considered in top and bottom portion of very thick elementary slice so average distributed load as the mobilised shear resistance on lateral sides of each slice can be reasonably adopted similar considerations was also used in previous studies of chattopadhyay and pise 1986 shelke and patra 2009 and shelke and mishra 2010 to illustrate the shear resistance the relative displacement between the soil and the pile shaft and the resultant shear stress are commonly considered to have a significant impact on the behavior on the pile especially when the interface enters the plastic state the modulus of elasticity for anchor is very high than the sands so there is displacement between the anchor and the sands under applied pull out loads the relative slip at the anchor sand interface is influenced by the highly roughen anchor surface dickin and leung 1990 presented that only 10 higher pull out resistance is achieved if the anchor surface is extremely roughened in this present study the anchor surface is not artificially roughened so the relative slip at the anchor sand interface has very negligible influence to promote the pull out resistance so this phenomenon has not taken into consideration in this present study the unit skin friction at the pile soil interface regulates the pile soil relative displacement a number of numerical models have been developed to introduce pile soil interaction phenomenon the numerical models can be sorted as i the theoretical load transfer method zhang et al 2010 where the load transfer function describe correlation between unit skin friction along the pile soil interface and pile soil relative displacement ii shear displacement method randolph and worth 1979 zhang and zhang 2011 lee and xiao 2001 considers the resulting displacement of soil obeys logarithmic relationship between shear stress along the shaft and the radial distance away from the pile shaft the hyperbolic model was adopted to describe the relationship between the unit skin friction up to the stage of full mobilisation and pile soil relative displacement zhang et al 2010 2014 lee and xiao 2001 the softening model of unit skin friction was used to describe the relationship between the unit skin friction shaft resistance degradation zhang et al 2014 xia and zou 2017 li et al 2020 studied the radial displacement of anisotropic consolidated clay during pile installation within the plastic region by combining cylindrical and spherical cavities wall boundary and elastic plastic boundary condition for and zou and zou 2017 investigated the cylindrical cavity expansion model using the non axisymmetric displacement boundary condition approach to evaluate vertical soil deformation mechanism around the pile li and zou 2019 presented the effect of elasto plastic strain approach around the cavity expansion in a saturated anisotripic soil mass qian et al 2020 studied the deformation mechanism of soil behind retaining wall within the

2006 and dickin and laman 2007 used the elasto plastic hyperbolic model in plaxis analysis plaxis analysis demarcated the failure in buried soil around plate anchors in homogeneous sand deposit rajesh and shreni 2014 cerfontaine et al 2019 the present observed non dimensional results are compared with the data obtained from finite element analysis using plaxis 3d foundation in the finite element package considering large scale numerical aspects with scale factor λ 1 10 physical properties of s1 and s2 are assumed to obey the mohr coulomb failure criteria along with the non associated flow rule undrained strength parameters ϕ ѱ and c are used to model the layered sand deposits here c has been chosen as a nonzero value with a maximum limit of 0 2 kpa in order to avoid the numerical instability by premature yielding of the sand media in mohr coulomb soil model plasticity is associated with the development of irreversible strains to assess whether or not plasticity occurs in a calculation a yield function f is used as a function of stress and strain the plastic yielding is allied with the situation f 0 this circumstance can be usually presented as a surface in the principal stress space in perfectly plastic model a yield surface is fully defined by model parameters and not exaggerated by plastic strains for stress states within the yield surface all strains are irreversible and the behaviour is merely elastic in order to ensure the rough interface between the anchor and the sand the anchor soil interface is considered a smooth contact with a strength reduction factor rinter as 0 1 is available in finite element programming of plaxis 3d foundation tan ϕi rinter tanϕ the belled anchor is modelled as a embedded pile element in 3d finite element model pile is comprised of beam element with three degree of freedom per node two transitional degree of freedom and one rotational degree of freedom the discritizaton of entire soil block is shown in typical fig 8 and the domain size is assumed to be similar to the scaling factor as foundation model in laboratory the extreme side boundaries are free to move only in the vertical y direction whereas the movement of the bottom boundary is completely restricted in any direction the vertical geometry line uy for which x and z coordinates can be equal to minimum and maximum in the model the mesh refinement has been carried out from the belled anchor with smaller and clustered elements to the boundary with bigger and scattered elements 9 results and discussions a discussion is made on the comparison of observed nu s1 s2 and nu s2 s1 in s1 s2 and s2 s1 deposits based on embedment ratios diameter ratios and bell angles based on the diversity of observed slip surfaces and analytical data of nu s1 s2 and nu s2 s1 both kinds of layered sand deposits comparison on predicted nu s1 s2 and nu s2 s1 in s1 s2 and s2 s1 deposits based on embedment ratios bell angles and width ratios diameter ratios are discussed herein an illustration on similarities between the experimental and numerical by fe analysis non dimensional pull out resistance and non linear failure surfaces in both the layered sand deposits is presented 9 1 physical modelling 9 1 1 comparison of observed break out factor and failure surfaces in s1 s2 and s2 s1 deposits based on embedment ratios l db and l wb it has been revealed from the observed data presented in typical fig 9 that due to increasing values of l db both the values of nu s1 s2 and nu s2 s1 are gradually increased irrespective of β ds db s1 s2 and s2 s1 deposit a similar manner of pull out resistance or break out factor of anchors buried in homogeneous sand dickin and leung 1990 1992 ghosh and bera 2010 bera and banerjee 2013 bera 2014 nazir et al 2014 deb and pal 2018 and layered deposits bouazza and finlay 1990 sakai and tanaka 2007 kumar 2003 sahoo and ganesh 2018 bhattacharya and kumar 2016 is well documented these graphical presentations also reveal that the same model can achieve higher break out factor in s1 s2 than s2 s1 deposit and this trend is consistent with higher values of l db in this figure at l db 3 4 and 5 it is shown that the values of nu s1 s2 are increased by 47 62 18 17 and 5 56 for m 45 0 33 in comparison of the values of nu s2 s1 a similar trend in the comparison of pull out resistance of plate anchor based on embedment ratio in layered sand is also available sakai and tanaka 2007 kumar 2003 the typical fig 10 present that for 45 anchor panels of ws wb 0 33 at higher l wb volume of breakout sands are gradually larger in both the types of sand deposits a larger volume of wedges represents more weight of breakout sand inside the slip surface as well as the higher frictional surface area of wedges surrounding the anchor this phenomenon is obvious being independent of sand layer system and this is not influenced by ws wb and β the similar pattern of observation for breakout sand inside the slip surface around belled anchors in homogeneous sand deposit has been outlined matsuo 1968 deb and pal 2018 it is reflected that in s1 s2 deposit breakout sand within the slip surface are having larger integrated weight and mobilised shear along slip surfaces hence higher nu pred s1 s2 is recorded than nu pred s2 s1 this trend is unaltered with higher values of l wb based on the failure surfaces data analysis show that for m 45 0 33 3 0 18s1 0 82s2 m 45 0 33 4 0 38si 0 62s2 and m 45 0 33 5 0 51s1 0 49s2 the corresponding values of nu pred s1 s2 are 6 43 8 78 and 10 08 respectively whereas for this same model nu pred s2 s1 values are 5 02 7 18 and 9 11 respectively as presented in fig 10 these predicted data are presented in fig 9 and show identical trend with observed data for the same models 9 1 2 comparison of observed break out factor and failure surfaces in s1 s2 and s2 s1 deposits based on diameter ratios ds db and width ratios ws wb there has been a general trend to gradually decrease in both nu s1 s2 and nu s2 s1 with increasing values of ds db irrespective of l db β s1 s2 and s2 s1 deposit as shown in typical fig 11 a similar pattern in the behaviour of break out factor of anchors installed in homogeneous sand deposits is well established dickin and leung 1992 ilamparuthi and muthukrishnaiah 1999 deb and pal 2018 these graphical illustrations also describe that in the same model nu s1 s2 is higher than nu s2 s1 and this trend is consistent with the values of ds db in this figure for models of 63 model anchors possessing ds db of 0 28 0 33 0 38 and 0 46 the values of nu s1 s2 are increased by 35 86 51 19 56 51 and 99 at l db of 4 in comparison of the values of nu s2 s1 the typical graphical representation of horizontal extent of slip surface vs height above the anchor base in one side of panels p 63 0 28 p 63 0 33 p 63 0 38 and p 63 0 46 at l wb of 4 are illustrated in typical fig 12 for both the layered sand deposits in fig 12 it is observed that volume of break out sand zone inside the ss 63 0 28 4 0 54s1 0 46s2 ss 63 0 33 4 0 47s1 0 53s2 ss 63 0 38 4 0 38s1 0 62s2 and ss 63 0 46 4 0 25s1 0 75s2 are in a gradual descending order so among these four sand zones nu pred s1 s2 value for ss 63 0 46 4 0 25s1 0 75s2 is least and for ss 63 0 28 4 0 54s1 0 46s2 is highest similarly in this same figure it is observed that break out sand zone inside the ss 63 0 28 4 0 54s2 0 46s1 ss 63 0 33 4 0 47s2 0 53s1 ss 63 0 38 4 0 38s2 0 62s1 and ss 63 0 46 4 0 25s2 0 75si are in a gradual descending order hence among these four zones nu pred s2 s1 value for ss 63 0 46 4 0 25s2 0 75s1 is minimum and for ss 63 0 28 4 0 54s2 0 46s1 is maximum it is observed that in s1 s2 deposit breakout sand within the slip surfaces are having larger integrated weight and mobilised shear along slip surfaces than those slip surfaces in s1 s2 deposit hence higher nu pred s1 s2 is recorded than nu pred s2 s1 for the 63 panel anchors installed at l wb of 4 having ws wb of 0 28 0 33 0 38 and 0 46 in s1 s2 and s2 s1 deposit the values of nu pred s2 s1 and nu pred s2 s1 are plotted in fig 12 this phenomenon is consistent being independent of sand layer system and l wb and β a similar pattern of observation for belled anchors in homogeneous sand deposit has been made elsewhere deb and pal 2018 these predicted data are presented in fig 11 and show identical trend with observed data for the same models 9 1 3 comparison on predicted pull out resistance in s1 s2 and s2 s1 deposits based on bell angles it has been observed in typical fig 13 that there has been a general trend to gradually decrease in both nu s1 s2 and nu s2 s1 with increasing values of β regardless l db ds db s1 s2 and s2 s1 deposit in the present study it is observed that when β increased from 45 to 63 and from 45 to 72 almost all the values of pull out resistance decreased by maximum 10 and by 25 respectively irrespective of the types of the layered sand deposit it is reported that anchors having a smaller bell angle 45 62 and 45 63 are effective in pull out resistance than 72 anchor in sand matsuo 1968 dickin and leung 1992 nazir et al 2014 deb and pal 2018 this graphical presentations show that in the case of each model qu s1 s2 is relatively higher than qu s2 s1 and this trend is independent of values of β in this figure for models of ds db 0 38 possessing β 45 54 63 and 72 it is illustrated that the values of qu s1 s2 are increased by 54 21 52 88 56 51 and 54 95 at l db 3 26 99 29 47 28 and 31 97 at l db 4 13 10 11 93 15 83 and 15 21 at l db 5 respectively in comparison of the values of qu s2 s1 the typical graphical representation of variation in slip surfaces for different bell angles in one side of panels of ws wb 0 28 at l wb 4 and of ws wb 0 33 at l wb 5 are represented in typical fig 14 for both s1 s2 and s2 s1 deposit in this figure it is noticed that the slip surfaces are developed in the sides of 45 54 and 63 panels are very close to each other than 72 panels in both s1 s2 and s2 s1 deposits matsuo 1968 outlined the nature of migration of slip surfaces in the sand for belled angle 0 60 in both s1 s2 and s2 s1 deposit a lesser volume of breakout sand zone is generated in the side of 72 panel and offers lesser dead weight of breakout sand and mobilised shear resistance at the collapsed stage this phenomenon is not influenced by sand layer arrangement l wb and ws wb the similar pattern of observation for belled anchors in homogeneous sand deposit has been discussed by deb and pal 2018 in fig 14 it is observed that total volume of break out sand zone i e the summation of the weight of breakout sand within the slip surfaces and mobilised shear along slip surfaces i e the values of nu pred s1 s2 inside ss 45 0 33 5 0 42s1 0 58s2 ss 54 0 33 5 0 42s1 0 58s2 ss 63 0 33 5 0 42s1 0 58s2 and ss 72 0 33 5 0 42s1 0 58s2 are comparatively larger than values of nu pred s2 s1 calculated for ss 45 0 33 5 0 42s2 0 58s1 ss 54 0 33 5 0 42s2 0 58s1 ss 63 0 33 5 0 42s2 0 58s1 and ss 72 0 33 5 0 42s2 0 58s1 respectively in this present study nu pred s1 s2 values are 10 08 9 85 9 37 and 7 24 for m 45 0 33 5 0 58s1 0 42s2 m 54 0 33 5 0 58s1 0 42s2 m 63 0 33 5 0 58s1 0 42s2 and m 72 0 33 5 0 58s1 0 42s2 respectively and for the same models m 45 0 33 5 0 58s2 0 42s1 m 54 0 33 5 0 58s2 0 42s1 m 63 0 33 5 0 58s2 0 42s1 m 72 0 33 5 0 58s2 0 42s1 qu pred s2 si values are 9 91 9 56 8 20 and 6 04 respectively these predicted data are presented in fig 13 and show similar trend with observed data for the same models 9 2 numerical modelling the typical fig 15 a and b depict the comparison between non dimensional pull out resistance vs relative displacement obtained from physical and numerical modelling these ensure the authenticity of the present numerical investigation from the figures a reasonably good agreement can be noticed between observed and numerical findings so the typical figs 16 18 reveal that the data of numerical analysis in reference with embedment ratios l db diameter ratios ds db and bell angle β can be adopted for parametric study with confidence in typical figs 19 and 20 the total displacement contours obtained from the numerical modelling are compared with observed non linear failure surfaces to ensure the validity of the present numerical investigation in s1 s2 as well as s2 s1 deposit so in this present study for shallow embedment ratios of 3 4 and 5 the breakout wedge is initiated from the edge of anchor base gradually progress upward and ended to sand surface from the figures a reasonable good agreement can be observed between experimental and numerical findings the figures present reasonably good agreement between observed and numerical non linear failure surfaces with the increase in height above the anchor bases in the slip surfaces the non linearity increases in bottom layer but after the crossing of the sand layers interface non linearity decreases in the top layer in s1 s2 deposit in s2 s1 deposit with the increase in height above the anchor bases in the slip surfaces the non linearity increases in a bottom layer but after the crossing of the sand layers interface non linearity increases more in the top layer a similar mechanism is involved for sand failure in both the layered sand deposits the induced overburden pressure on anchor base results in confinement of sand close to the zone of anchor base subsequently confines dilation of sand as well as the horizontal extension of failure points near anchor base near to sand surface overburden pressure progressively reduces and due to dilatancy of sand expansions of failure points are increased in horizontal direction irrespective of sand strata 10 validation of observed data and practical applications fig 21 shows the plot of observed pull out resistance qu s1 s2 and qu s2 s1 vs predicted pull out resistance qu pred s1 s2 and qu pred s2 s1 among 96 numbers of qu pred s1 s2 and qu pred s2 s1 data total 93 data are with the range of 10 72 to 09 83 variation in respect to qu s1 s2 and qu s2 s1 this study may simulate conditions a where the ground water table is very low and b ground water is temporarily lowered down to facilitate constructional operations and c the sand media has some cementation property in absence of field investigation an ideal knowledge and simulation of the soil profile in the laboratory as well as application of horizontal slice method on most probable slip surface may be helpful for the geotechnical engineers to rationally predict pull out resistance as the tests are conducted in the laboratory on a few numbers of belled anchor models and panels in layered sand having properties narrowed by variation so the described method and equations should be verified and revise consequently when different types of soil of wide variety of geotechnical properties will be met in a construction site a number of investigations on pull out resistance of belled anchor are available for ranges of embedment ratios and diameter ratios and numbers of formulations are given for plate anchors in homogeneous sand deposit in literature whereas the study on pull out resistance of belled anchor in layered sand with a ranges of thickness ratios of sand layers are virtually nil so the present study generates almost a new solution for the ranges of characteristics of belled anchor the present experimental and analytical results cannot validate with previous results but the non dimensional pull out resistance and non linear behaviour of slip surfaces for small scale laboratory models are very close and following the similar trend likewise the comparatively larger models λ 1 10 as revealed from the data of finite element analysis for the same embedment ratio anchor characteristics and foundation properties there may be some differences between the results of the numerical modelling and laboratory experiments because the experiments in laboratory are conducted with 1g laboratory models in well controlled soil and model conditions the numerical model analysis is dependent on element size and shapes distribution of cluster and mesh refinement the method of programming is completely based on iterations and matrix through mathematical operations the numerically obtained non dimensional pull out resistance are within the range of 02 15 to 8 45 variation with respect to the observed data though in field there may be chances of manual error environmental errors and machinery errors up to some extent the in situ investigation results are preferable to compare with the data of laboratory investigations but the in situ investigations on pull out resistance of single belled anchor pile in two layered sand deposits are virtually nil so a comparative study between the proposed method and the in situ investigation is difficult so in the present study in the finite element package large scale numerical aspects with scale factor λ 1 10 is considered to relate with the practical field 11 summary and concluding remarks on the basis of observed data of pull out resistance observation and analysis of slip surfaces to numerate pull out resistance and discussions the following findings are noteworthy and have listed below gradually higher pull out resistance of belled anchors are achieved for higher l db and lesser ds db values in both layered sand deposits the 45 54 and 63 belled anchors are found to be more capable of resisting pull out force than 72 anchors in both layered sand deposits in this study it is found that nu s1 s2 is comparatively higher than nu s2 s1 for the same model and this trend is consistent for increasing values of l db and decreasing values of ds db and β all the slip surfaces are showing a similar trend in the failure mechanism they have developed from the edge of anchor base and completed at sand surface to the maximum horizontal extent regardless of the type of sand deposits values of ws wb l wb and β in s1 s2 deposit the failure curves are concave inward and in s2 s1 deposit the failure curves are convex outward in pattern in each model the values of nu pred s1 s2 and nu pred s2 s1 are gradually higher with increasing l db and decreasing ws wb and β the summation of dead weight of sand inside the wedge and frictional shear on the surfaces of the break out sand zones are higher in s1 s2 than s2 s1 deposit for the same model and this trend is consistent for all models with respect to l wb ws wb and β out of 96 numbers of predicted data total 93 data are within the range of 10 72 to

21967,the pull out resistance of single belled anchors and non linear slip surfaces in two different layered sand deposits in respect to embedment ratios diameter ratios and bell angles are evaluated from experimental study the predicted pull out resistances are computed by horizontal slice method applied on observed slip surfaces from the dyed and non dyed layers of sand deposits the models can achieve higher pull out resistance for higher embedment ratios lesser diameter ratios and bell angles in both the sand deposits the 45 54 and 63 belled anchors are efficient to resist pull out loads than 72 anchors the pull out resistance are correlated with respective slip surfaces based on embedment ratios width ratios and bell angles the slip surfaces are concave inward and upward and convex outward and upward in pattern based on sand deposits total 93 predicted results are within 10 72 to 09 83 variations comparison to observed data numerical analysis for comparatively larger models based on plaxis 3d foundation are found to closely following the similar trend of non dimensional pull out resistance and non linear behaviour of slip surfaces of small scale 1 g laboratory models the non dimensional pull out resistance obtained from plaxis 3d foundation analysis are within 2 15 to 8 45 variation comparison to the observed data keywords pull out resistances belled anchors non linear slip surfaces layered sand horizontal slice method dyed sand layers 1 introduction anchors have been used as a common part of substructure in both marine and land structures primarily to resist tensile loads as well as against overturning moments off shore structures like dolphins jetty and wharf structures are continuously subjected to thrust of wind storm and hurricanes produce a cyclic wave fluctuation in water level thrust and pull of the berthing ships and sometimes thrust of thick sheets of moving ice carried out by the tide the pipe lines used for transporting oil and gas under sea water is often subjected to considerable magnitudes of uplift forces so in such situation the provision of anchors are mandatory the intensive explorations of hydrocarbons in deep sea need for large off shore structures anchor is a convenient and conventional method of foundation construction for works under water table and coastal shore structures such as underground pumping station oil storage tanks and buildings having several underground floors in coastal areas in radar tower television tower power pole road side sign posts and out door sign pools imbalance horizontal forces are mostly due to severe wind velocity in the design of silos overhead water tank and tall chimneys overturning loads as well as associated moment considerations are one of the most important issues previous researchers have well documented the efficiency of belled and plate anchors against uplift in dry homogeneous sand but limited researches have been done on uplift behaviour of plate anchors in layered sand the pull out resistance of model belled anchors is significantly affected by embedment ratios bell angles and diameter ratios in homogeneous sand bed dickin and leung 1990 1992 ghosh and bera 2010 bera and banerjee 2013 bera 2014 nazir et al 2014 previous studies on circular plate anchors having different sizes buried at different embedment depth are also available sujatha and balamurugan 2014 balla 1961 meyerhof and adams 1968 clemence and veesaert 1977 murray and geddes 1987 sujatha and balamurugan 2014 and krishnaswamy and parashar 1994 for a homogeneous dense sand bed it was assumed that in analytical models of non linear slip surfaces net ultimate pull out resistance was derived as the summation of the weight of breakout sand within the slip surfaces and mobilised shear along slip surfaces downs and chieurzzri 1966 matsuo 1968 vermeer and sutjiadi 1985 chattopadhyay and pise 1986 deb and pal 2018 ghaly and hanna 1994 murray and geddes 1987 rao and kumar 1994 saeedy 1987 vanitha et al 2007 rowe and davis 1982 developed an elasto plastic finite element approach for predicting load displacement behaviour of anchors pulled vertically pull out resistance problem of horizontal anchors in sand using non linear finite element code was studied by basudhar and singh 1994 rajesh and shreni 2014 and cerfontaine et al 2019 berghe et al 2006 and dickin and laman 2007 also used the 2d plaxis analysis for plat anchor in homogeneous sand deposit very few experimental studies on pull out resistance of circular plate anchor are available in layered sand bouazza and finlay 1990 and sakai and tanaka 2007 the upper and lower bound theorem of limit analysis in combination with finite element method to compute uplift resistance of plate anchors in two layered sand deposits were studied by sakai and tanaka 2007 kouzer and kumar 2009 and bhattacharya and kumar 2016 the details of the failure mechanism in layered sand bed are documented on the basis of velocity hydrograph kumar 2003 rigid block collapse mechanism in combination of upper bound theorem of limit analysis sahoo and ganesh 2018 and plain strain and axisymmetric lower bound limit analysis with the combination of finite elements and linear optimisation bhattacharya and kumar 2016 till date there is a dearth of experimental and numerical study to understand the variations in the pull out resistance of belled anchors and failure mechanisms in the different layered sand deposits this still needs for more attention to have a clear understanding the presently available limited previous studies on pull out resistance as well as analytical models are insufficient enough to correlate the variation in pull out resistance due to changes in the pattern of slip surface in different layered sand deposits in connection with various parameters 2 failure mechanisms the breakout wedge is progressive in nature from the edge of anchor base to sand surface as loading is gradually transferred from anchor to the surrounding sand and hence there are changes in the state of stresses in different locations within zone of breakout sand the breakout sand within the slip surfaces is developed at the same velocity as that is the upward velocity of the anchor kumar 2003 in the early stage of applied upward pull with an upward displacement of anchor the total stresses underneath the anchor base start to gradually decrease and at the same time there is a simultaneous increase of total stress immediately above the anchor base and this circumstance continues till the complete generation of breakout sand zone is occurred at the first phase of uplift loading the sand at the nearest zone of anchor base displaces with the upward displacement of anchor and at the same time there is the opening of cavity underneath the anchor base with the increase in pulling simultaneously the cavity is enlarged in the compressed zone the sand is locked up and there is higher interlocking among the sand particles above the anchor base than rolling and sliding ilamparuthi and muthukrishnaiah 1999 the locked up sand near anchor base help to produce an extensive plastic zone of collapse rowe and davis 1982 with continuous pulling the cavity is expanded and the level of shear stress in the sand near the anchor base is rose gradually to attain shear strength of sand in this study it is also observed that the failure surfaces are started to generate from the edge of anchor base and progressively move above the anchor base towards sand surface with gradually higher horizontal extension this phenomenon is due to the dilatancy of sand rowe and davis 1982 at the fully collapsed stage the plastic flow of sand surrounding the anchor base moves downward to fill the void at the verge of failure the tension cracks produced in sand around the base are responsible for plastic flow to progress downward to fill the voids and at that moment shear strength is fully mobilised it has been assumed that due to pull out of anchor earth pressure of within the breakout sand domain transformed from semi active condition to passive condition matsuo 1968 3 aim of the present study this experimental study attempts to investigate the comparison of i non dimensional pull out resistance of model belled anchors and ii respective slip surfaces in both the sides of panels based on two different types of layered sand deposits with a variation of a few embedment ratios and anchor properties an attempt is made to find out the significant models based on foundation media on observed slip surfaces horizontal slice method is applied to predict pull out resistance the reason behind the variations in predicted pull out resistance in different layered sand deposits are correlated with respective slip surfaces based on embedment ratios bell angles and width ratios diameter ratios in this study it is also intended to outline the similarities between the experimental and numerical by finite element analysis in plaxis 3d foundation non dimensional pull out resistance and non linear failure surfaces in both the layered sand deposits 4 sand model belled anchors panels and model tank two different kinds of dry sands are used to characterize the layered foundation beds and these are designated as sand 1 s1 and sand 2 s2 fig 1 presents the grain size distribution of s1 and s2 samples the calibrated placement density of s1 and s2 are 15 60 and 16 90 kn m3 respectively the densities of s1 and s2 are achieved by raining technique dickin and leung 1990 and bouazza and finlay 1990 using soil tray and calibrated height of soil tray is fixed at 700 mm in both the cases there is no possibility of segregation of sand particles in the rain fall technique in table 1 it is noticed that the γ2 and ϕ2 in s2 are higher than γ1 and ϕ1 of s1 so s2 is stronger than s1 for the present experimental conditions for the 1 g laboratoy model the bell and shaft parts are made up from rounded solid bar and both the parts are joined by internal welding the hollow panels are made up from 1 mm thick steel plates the ws and wb are identical to ds and db respectively the db and wb are constant at 26 mm the height of models and panels is fixed at 650 mm the lengths of panels are 590 2 5 mm the detailing of β ds db or ws wb l db or l wb are listed in table 2 columns i to iii at top of each 3d model and at mid length of each panel a grooving arrangement is provided to grip the proving ring gently on the outer part of grooving arrangement a couple of flat steel strips are welded so that the dial gauges can rest on them tenderly at 180 apart from each other the inner area of the model testing tank is 700 mm length 600 mm width 700 mm height the tank is supported by a steel frame and its four sides are enclosed by pieces of plaxi glass of 12 mm thick few steel stiffeners are vertically welded with the frame the sheets of plaxi glass are bolted with stiffeners and frame to prevent the sheet from deflecting outward the size of the testing tank is adequate to avoid the boundary effects 4 1 sand bed preparation for 3d models and panels in the beginning a 100 mm thick dry compacted sand bed is well prepared with horizontal surface and model or panel is placed over it before the preparation of foundation media either s1 s2 or s2 s1 in order to prepare s1 s2 deposit the bed of s2 having a certain thickness l s2 ʹ of 168 mm is made and over s2 s1 is poured up to the predetermined height l s1 ʹʹ to attain desired total embedment depth the ratios of l s1 ʹʹ l and l s2 ʹ l are listed in table 2 columns iv and v the s2 s1 deposit is similarly prepared the ratios of l s2 ʹʹ l and l s1 ʹ l are listed in table 2 columns viii and ix in order to ensure the uniformity of sand density within the testing tank six wooden boxes of 100 cc are sited in the corners of the tank in different locations the variations in local densities of s1 and s2 among these boxes are found within 1 only to study the slip surfaces in both the sides of panels in s1 s2 media successive layers of green dyed sand having 3 mm thickness and non dyed sand i e s2 having 18 mm thickness is poured up to height of 168 mm l s2 ʹ and similarly the overlying layer of s1 is prepared by red dyed and non dyed sand maintaining the same thickness to prepare the s2 s1 media successive layers of 3 mm thick red dyed and 18 mm thick non dyed sand s1 is poured up to a height of 168 mm l s1 ʹ and following a similar approach the overlying deposit of s2 is prepared by green dyed and non dyed sand s2 the regularity of sand density is checked for dyed and non dyed sand layers also as already discussed 4 2 experimental programme to perform an experimental study on the pull out resistance of single belled anchors and failure pattern in layered sand deposits in both the sides of panels a couple of conditions are considered and explained below series a experimental study on pull out resistance vs model displacement relationship for models installed to attain l db of 3 4 and 5 having db ds of 0 28 0 33 0 38 and 0 46 and possessing β of 45 54 63 and 72 in s1 s2 and s2 s1 deposit in total 3 4 4 2 96 numbers of tests are performed series b experiments and observations on failure mechanism of sand deposits in both the sides of panels installed to attain l tb of 3 4 and 5 having ws wb of 0 28 0 33 0 38 and 0 46 and possessing β of 45 54 63 and 72 in s1 s2 and s2 s1 deposit in total 3 4 3 2 96 numbers of tests are performed 4 3 experimental set up and methodology the fig 2 presents the schematic view of the experimental set up in laboratory the loading frame is fabricated from steel channels and its top horizontal beams act as reaction frame the base of the loading frame is bolted with a concrete beam for stability there is a vertical pulling shaft act as long screw and can freely move upward and downward direction through the nut arrangement the nut arrangement is welded at the centre of horizontal beams and the nut possesses ball bearing arrangement the model is connected with the bottom of the pulling shaft via proving ring the vertical movement of the shaft is controlled by manually rotating circular wheel connected with nut arrangement the upward displacements of the anchors are controlled by clockwise rotation of the wheel two dial gauges 0 01 mm accuracy are attached properly with magnetic bases and are fitted on a couple of steel bar laid over the top of the testing tank the proving ring 1 0 kn capacity response demonstrates the gross pull out load on models and corresponding upward displacement of the anchors are recorded from the reading of both the dial gauges 5 model panel and slip surface designations in table 2 columns i ii iii vi vii ix and x the particulars of models are presented for both kind of layered sand to represent a model and panel a common coding system consist of four parts is used the first second third and fourth parts illustrate the type m or p β ds db or ws wb l db or l wb respectively as presented in table 2 columns iv and v the symbol m 63 0 28 5 implies that a model is having β 63 ds db 0 28 and buried at l db 5 and the replicate panel is identified as p 63 0 28 5 in the detail designation of a model the fifth part illustrates the percentages of thickness of the sand i e either s1 or s2 in the bottom and top layer respectively when a model is belonging to β of 63 ds db of 0 33 at l db of 4 its 53 of total l is in top layer s1 and 47 of total l is in bottom layer s2 respectively then it is denoted by m 63 0 33 4 0 53s1 0 47s2 the replicate slip surfaces are also presented in a similar manner in table 3 columns iv and vii the symbol ss 45 0 28 3 0 61s2 0 39s1 implies that the slip surface is developed in the side of panel p 45 0 28 3 having β of 45 ws wb of 0 28 and attains l wb of 3 and its 61 of total l is in top layer s2 and 39 of total l is in the bottom layer s1 6 observations on experimental results 6 1 observations on load displacement behaviour from physical modelling the fig 3 a and b illustrate typical curves of net pull out resistance vs model displacement relationship for the models m 45 0 33 and m 63 0 28 respectively in both the layered sand deposits the patterns of net pull out resistance vs model displacement curves are not similar for both layered sand media in s1 s2 deposit in very early stage the curves are linear showing true elastic response and afterwards the curves take the form of pseudo elastic pattern resemble the curvilinear shape and ultimately produces elasto plastic response with hasty growth of the plastic region as well as the highest rate of deformation this may be due to the reason that as the load is transferred from anchor to the sand of bottom layer s2 break it at comparatively higher force and when load started to transfer in the comparatively weaker top layer s1 less force is required to break that one a similar pattern of relationship in uplift load vs displacement curves is available in layered sandy deposit bouazza and finlay 1990 in s2 s1 deposit in general more or less curvilinear shape is achieved in net pull out resistance vs model displacement curve up to the layer of si and after that in all curves there is a sudden higher rate of increment in pull out resistance at a very lower rate of upward displacement this may be due to the reason that as the load is transferred from anchor to the sand of bottom layer s1 break it at comparatively lower force and when load started to transfer in the top layer s2 of comparatively higher strength more force is required to break it this pattern of behaviour is most prominent when the thickness of s2 is less than s1 similar tendency in the relationship of uplift load vs anchor displacement curves for circular plate anchors embedded in soft clay underlain by dense sand is documented stewart 1985 in both cases at ultimate or collapsed stage strength mobilization is lower than the rate of increment in vertical displacement observed net ultimate pull out resistance qu is always reported as self weight subtracted from the gross uplift capacity the embedment depth anchor and bulk density of foundation media are primary parameters in the uplift resistance problem so these parameters are used to non dimensional the uplift resistance data the normal pull out resistance i e breakout factor nu s1 s2 and nu s2 s1 is always presented as 1 n u s 1 s 2 q u s 1 s 2 a b γ 1 l s 1 γ 2 l s 2 2 n u s 2 s 1 q u s 2 s 1 a b γ 1 l s 2 γ 2 l s 1 6 2 observations on non linear slip surfaces from physical modelling the typical fig 4 a and b and c show the typical view of slip surfaces ss 45 0 33 4 0 47s1 0 53s2 ss 72 0 38 4 0 38s1 0 62s2 and ss 63 0 38 4 0 38s1 0 62s2 in both the sides of panel p 45 0 33 p 72 0 38 and p 63 0 38 respectively the typical fig 5 a and b and c present the typical view of slip surfaces ss 63 0 38 4 0 38s2 0 62s1 ss 72 0 33 4 0 47s2 0 53s1 and ss 54 0 28 3 0 39s2 61s1 in both the sides of panel p 63 0 38 ss 72 0 33 and p 54 0 28 respectively the breakout wedge is started from the edge of anchor base gradually progress upward and terminated to sand surface so in this present study for embedment ratios of 3 4 and 5 at ultimate load a shallow anchor exhibits general shear failure pattern at collapse stage failure appears up to the sand surface and the break out sand mass above the anchor base bounded by the slip surface is subjected to strain which is the only category of shallow anchor the failure mechanism is similar in both the sand beds in this present study two different pattern in slip surfaces can be noticed concavity inward and upward in s1 s2 deposit and convexity outward and upward in s2 s1 deposit at the sand surface lateral extent of failure point is maximum in both the sand bed and denoted by xmax s1 s2 and xmax s2 s1 in fig 4 a and b and c for s1 s2 deposit the tendency of failure points to spread in the top layer i e s1 is lesser compared to those failure points as appeared in the bottom layer i e s2 it has been calculated that the βa s1 s2 values are within the range of 15 95 19 65 for 45 54 and 63 panels and within the range of 10 78 13 39 for 72 panels hence in general the βf s1 s2 values are within the range of 25 02 to 19 09 for 45 54 and 63 panels and within the range of 10 78 13 39 for 72 panel in figs 5 a b and c for s2 s1 deposit the tendency of failure points in the top layer i e s2 to spread is higher compared to those failure points appeared in the bottom layer i e s1 it has been calculated that the βa s2 s1 values are within the range of 12 09 15 95 for 45 54 and 63 panels and within the range of 08 13 10 78 for 72 panels in general βa s2 s1 values are within the range of 32 74 50 19 for 45 54 and 63 panels and the βf s2 s1 values are within the range of 25 46 34 22 for 72 panels here the differences between βa s2 s1 and βf s2 s1 are at least 10 which reveal the nonlinearity of slip surfaces this type of diversity in the behaviour of slip surfaces generated in s1 s2 and s2 s1 deposit is due to differences in the values of γ and ϕ of s1 and s2 a similar pattern in slip surfaces in layered sand deposits are also found in previous studies using shear bend propagation by linear slip surfaces sakai and tanaka 2007 the collapse mechanism by velocity hydrograph kumar 2003 and rigid block collapse mechanism bhattacharya and kumar 2016 7 analysis of predicted breakout factors using the horizontal slice method the failure points as obtained in both the sides of panels can pretend around the model anchors same scale as a axisymmetric solid body three dimensional of sand the panels as well as generated breakout sand zone within the slip surfaces are symmetric along the vertical axis the midpoint of the panel base is considered as the origin 0 0 the failure points at every 21 mm height from the anchor base and deformed point in the dyed layers are presented in a coordinate system as demonstrated in fig 4 a b and c and 5 a b and c in both the type of layered sand deposits on the basis of identified coordinates of failure points the numbers and dimensions of horizontal slices each having 21 mm δy thick are obtained the elemental forces acting on slice wedge is presented by free body diagram as shown in figs 6 and 7 for s1 s2 and s2 s1 deposit respectively the method of elastic analysis is explained below 7 1 predicted breakout factors in s1 s2 deposit a disc wedge in the form of truncated cone of thickness δy at a height of yi and yj above the anchor base contained between the axysymmetric failure surface is considered in fig 6 the elementary forces acting on the wedge are shown in this figure the domain outside the failure zone is in rest condition so the normal force on the failure surface of the failure wedge corresponds to lateral earth pressure at rest at the collapsed stage in state of limit equilibrium of soil according to mohr coulomb failure principle the downward acting resultant vertical component of mobilised shear resistance on the outer area of for ith and jth i e tvi and tvj along the failure surface of length δli and δlj are evaluated as follows 3 t vi 2 γπ x i δx i 2 y i δy y i k 0 cos β i sin β i tan ϕ 4 t vj 2 γπδ y x j δx j 2 y j δy y j k 0 cos β j sin β j tan ϕ ko 1 sin ϕ earth pressure coefficient δ l i δ y cos β i lateral length in i th slice and δ l j δ y cos β j lateral length in j th slice as no shear stress is considered in top and bottom portion of very thick elementary slice so average distributed load as the mobilised shear resistance on lateral sides of each slice can be reasonably adopted similar considerations was also used in previous studies of chattopadhyay and pise 1986 shelke and patra 2009 and shelke and mishra 2010 to illustrate the shear resistance the relative displacement between the soil and the pile shaft and the resultant shear stress are commonly considered to have a significant impact on the behavior on the pile especially when the interface enters the plastic state the modulus of elasticity for anchor is very high than the sands so there is displacement between the anchor and the sands under applied pull out loads the relative slip at the anchor sand interface is influenced by the highly roughen anchor surface dickin and leung 1990 presented that only 10 higher pull out resistance is achieved if the anchor surface is extremely roughened in this present study the anchor surface is not artificially roughened so the relative slip at the anchor sand interface has very negligible influence to promote the pull out resistance so this phenomenon has not taken into consideration in this present study the unit skin friction at the pile soil interface regulates the pile soil relative displacement a number of numerical models have been developed to introduce pile soil interaction phenomenon the numerical models can be sorted as i the theoretical load transfer method zhang et al 2010 where the load transfer function describe correlation between unit skin friction along the pile soil interface and pile soil relative displacement ii shear displacement method randolph and worth 1979 zhang and zhang 2011 lee and xiao 2001 considers the resulting displacement of soil obeys logarithmic relationship between shear stress along the shaft and the radial distance away from the pile shaft the hyperbolic model was adopted to describe the relationship between the unit skin friction up to the stage of full mobilisation and pile soil relative displacement zhang et al 2010 2014 lee and xiao 2001 the softening model of unit skin friction was used to describe the relationship between the unit skin friction shaft resistance degradation zhang et al 2014 xia and zou 2017 li et al 2020 studied the radial displacement of anisotropic consolidated clay

2006 and dickin and laman 2007 used the elasto plastic hyperbolic model in plaxis analysis plaxis analysis demarcated the failure in buried soil around plate anchors in homogeneous sand deposit rajesh and shreni 2014 cerfontaine et al 2019 the present observed non dimensional results are compared with the data obtained from finite element analysis using plaxis 3d foundation in the finite element package considering large scale numerical aspects with scale factor λ 1 10 physical properties of s1 and s2 are assumed to obey the mohr coulomb failure criteria along with the non associated flow rule undrained strength parameters ϕ ѱ and c are used to model the layered sand deposits here c has been chosen as a nonzero value with a maximum limit of 0 2 kpa in order to avoid the numerical instability by premature yielding of the sand media in mohr coulomb soil model plasticity is associated with the development of irreversible strains to assess whether or not plasticity occurs in a calculation a yield function f is used as a function of stress and strain the plastic yielding is allied with the situation f 0 this circumstance can be usually presented as a surface in the principal stress space in perfectly plastic model a yield surface is fully defined by model parameters and not exaggerated by plastic strains for stress states within the yield surface all strains are irreversible and the behaviour is merely elastic in order to ensure the rough interface between the anchor and the sand the anchor soil interface is considered a smooth contact with a strength reduction factor rinter as 0 1 is available in finite element programming of plaxis 3d foundation tan ϕi rinter tanϕ the belled anchor is modelled as a embedded pile element in 3d finite element model pile is comprised of beam element with three degree of freedom per node two transitional degree of freedom and one rotational degree of freedom the discritizaton of entire soil block is shown in typical fig 8 and the domain size is assumed to be similar to the scaling factor as foundation model in laboratory the extreme side boundaries are free to move only in the vertical y direction whereas the movement of the bottom boundary is completely restricted in any direction the vertical geometry line uy for which x and z coordinates can be equal to minimum and maximum in the model the mesh refinement has been carried out from the belled anchor with smaller and clustered elements to the boundary with bigger and scattered elements 9 results and discussions a discussion is made on the comparison of observed nu s1 s2 and nu s2 s1 in s1 s2 and s2 s1 deposits based on embedment ratios diameter ratios and bell angles based on the diversity of observed slip surfaces and analytical data of nu s1 s2 and nu s2 s1 both kinds of layered sand deposits comparison on predicted nu s1 s2 and nu s2 s1 in s1 s2 and s2 s1 deposits based on embedment ratios bell angles and width ratios diameter ratios are discussed herein an illustration on similarities between the experimental and numerical by fe analysis non dimensional pull out resistance and non linear failure surfaces in both the layered sand deposits is presented 9 1 physical modelling 9 1 1 comparison of observed break out factor and failure surfaces in s1 s2 and s2 s1 deposits based on embedment ratios l db and l wb it has been revealed from the observed data presented in typical fig 9 that due to increasing values of l db both the values of nu s1 s2 and nu s2 s1 are gradually increased irrespective of β ds db s1 s2 and s2 s1 deposit a similar manner of pull out resistance or break out factor of anchors buried in homogeneous sand dickin and leung 1990 1992 ghosh and bera 2010 bera and banerjee 2013 bera 2014 nazir et al 2014 deb and pal 2018 and layered deposits bouazza and finlay 1990 sakai and tanaka 2007 kumar 2003 sahoo and ganesh 2018 bhattacharya and kumar 2016 is well documented these graphical presentations also reveal that the same model can achieve higher break out factor in s1 s2 than s2 s1 deposit and this trend is consistent with higher values of l db in this figure at l db 3 4 and 5 it is shown that the values of nu s1 s2 are increased by 47 62 18 17 and 5 56 for m 45 0 33 in comparison of the values of nu s2 s1 a similar trend in the comparison of pull out resistance of plate anchor based on embedment ratio in layered sand is also available sakai and tanaka 2007 kumar 2003 the typical fig 10 present that for 45 anchor panels of ws wb 0 33 at higher l wb volume of breakout sands are gradually larger in both the types of sand deposits a larger volume of wedges represents more weight of breakout sand inside the slip surface as well as the higher frictional surface area of wedges surrounding the anchor this phenomenon is obvious being independent of sand layer system and this is not influenced by ws wb and β the similar pattern of observation for breakout sand inside the slip surface around belled anchors in homogeneous sand deposit has been outlined matsuo 1968 deb and pal 2018 it is reflected that in s1 s2 deposit breakout sand within the slip surface are having larger integrated weight and mobilised shear along slip surfaces hence higher nu pred s1 s2 is recorded than nu pred s2 s1 this trend is unaltered with higher values of l wb based on the failure surfaces data analysis show that for m 45 0 33 3 0 18s1 0 82s2 m 45 0 33 4 0 38si 0 62s2 and m 45 0 33 5 0 51s1 0 49s2 the corresponding values of nu pred s1 s2 are 6 43 8 78 and 10 08 respectively whereas for this same model nu pred s2 s1 values are 5 02 7 18 and 9 11 respectively as presented in fig 10 these predicted data are presented in fig 9 and show identical trend with observed data for the same models 9 1 2 comparison of observed break out factor and failure surfaces in s1 s2 and s2 s1 deposits based on diameter ratios ds db and width ratios ws wb there has been a general trend to gradually decrease in both nu s1 s2 and nu s2 s1 with increasing values of ds db irrespective of l db β s1 s2 and s2 s1 deposit as shown in typical fig 11 a similar pattern in the behaviour of break out factor of anchors installed in homogeneous sand deposits is well established dickin and leung 1992 ilamparuthi and muthukrishnaiah 1999 deb and pal 2018 these graphical illustrations also describe that in the same model nu s1 s2 is higher than nu s2 s1 and this trend is consistent with the values of ds db in this figure for models of 63 model anchors possessing ds db of 0 28 0 33 0 38 and 0 46 the values of nu s1 s2 are increased by 35 86 51 19 56 51 and 99 at l db of 4 in comparison of the values of nu s2 s1 the typical graphical representation of horizontal extent of slip surface vs height above the anchor base in one side of panels p 63 0 28 p 63 0 33 p 63 0 38 and p 63 0 46 at l wb of 4 are illustrated in typical fig 12 for both the layered sand deposits in fig 12 it is observed that volume of break out sand zone inside the ss 63 0 28 4 0 54s1 0 46s2 ss 63 0 33 4 0 47s1 0 53s2 ss 63 0 38 4 0 38s1 0 62s2 and ss 63 0 46 4 0 25s1 0 75s2 are in a gradual descending order so among these four sand zones nu pred s1 s2 value for ss 63 0 46 4 0 25s1 0 75s2 is least and for ss 63 0 28 4 0 54s1 0 46s2 is highest similarly in this same figure it is observed that break out sand zone inside the ss 63 0 28 4 0 54s2 0 46s1 ss 63 0 33 4 0 47s2 0 53s1 ss 63 0 38 4 0 38s2 0 62s1 and ss 63 0 46 4 0 25s2 0 75si are in a gradual descending order hence among these four zones nu pred s2 s1 value for ss 63 0 46 4 0 25s2 0 75s1 is minimum and for ss 63 0 28 4 0 54s2 0 46s1 is maximum it is observed that in s1 s2 deposit breakout sand within the slip surfaces are having larger integrated weight and mobilised shear along slip surfaces than those slip surfaces in s1 s2 deposit hence higher nu pred s1 s2 is recorded than nu pred s2 s1 for the 63 panel anchors installed at l wb of 4 having ws wb of 0 28 0 33 0 38 and 0 46 in s1 s2 and s2 s1 deposit the values of nu pred s2 s1 and nu pred s2 s1 are plotted in fig 12 this phenomenon is consistent being independent of sand layer system and l wb and β a similar pattern of observation for belled anchors in homogeneous sand deposit has been made elsewhere deb and pal 2018 these predicted data are presented in fig 11 and show identical trend with observed data for the same models 9 1 3 comparison on predicted pull out resistance in s1 s2 and s2 s1 deposits based on bell angles it has been observed in typical fig 13 that there has been a general trend to gradually decrease in both nu s1 s2 and nu s2 s1 with increasing values of β regardless l db ds db s1 s2 and s2 s1 deposit in the present study it is observed that when β increased from 45 to 63 and from 45 to 72 almost all the values of pull out resistance decreased by maximum 10 and by 25 respectively irrespective of the types of the layered sand deposit it is reported that anchors having a smaller bell angle 45 62 and 45 63 are effective in pull out resistance than 72 anchor in sand matsuo 1968 dickin and leung 1992 nazir et al 2014 deb and pal 2018 this graphical presentations show that in the case of each model qu s1 s2 is relatively higher than qu s2 s1 and this trend is independent of values of β in this figure for models of ds db 0 38 possessing β 45 54 63 and 72 it is illustrated that the values of qu s1 s2 are increased by 54 21 52 88 56 51 and 54 95 at l db 3 26 99 29 47 28 and 31 97 at l db 4 13 10 11 93 15 83 and 15 21 at l db 5 respectively in comparison of the values of qu s2 s1 the typical graphical representation of variation in slip surfaces for different bell angles in one side of panels of ws wb 0 28 at l wb 4 and of ws wb 0 33 at l wb 5 are represented in typical fig 14 for both s1 s2 and s2 s1 deposit in this figure it is noticed that the slip surfaces are developed in the sides of 45 54 and 63 panels are very close to each other than 72 panels in both s1 s2 and s2 s1 deposits matsuo 1968 outlined the nature of migration of slip surfaces in the sand for belled angle 0 60 in both s1 s2 and s2 s1 deposit a lesser volume of breakout sand zone is generated in the side of 72 panel and offers lesser dead weight of breakout sand and mobilised shear resistance at the collapsed stage this phenomenon is not influenced by sand layer arrangement l wb and ws wb the similar pattern of observation for belled anchors in homogeneous sand deposit has been discussed by deb and pal 2018 in fig 14 it is observed that total volume of break out sand zone i e the summation of the weight of breakout sand within the slip surfaces and mobilised shear along slip surfaces i e the values of nu pred s1 s2 inside ss 45 0 33 5 0 42s1 0 58s2 ss 54 0 33 5 0 42s1 0 58s2 ss 63 0 33 5 0 42s1 0 58s2 and ss 72 0 33 5 0 42s1 0 58s2 are comparatively larger than values of nu pred s2 s1 calculated for ss 45 0 33 5 0 42s2 0 58s1 ss 54 0 33 5 0 42s2 0 58s1 ss 63 0 33 5 0 42s2 0 58s1 and ss 72 0 33 5 0 42s2 0 58s1 respectively in this present study nu pred s1 s2 values are 10 08 9 85 9 37 and 7 24 for m 45 0 33 5 0 58s1 0 42s2 m 54 0 33 5 0 58s1 0 42s2 m 63 0 33 5 0 58s1 0 42s2 and m 72 0 33 5 0 58s1 0 42s2 respectively and for the same models m 45 0 33 5 0 58s2 0 42s1 m 54 0 33 5 0 58s2 0 42s1 m 63 0 33 5 0 58s2 0 42s1 m 72 0 33 5 0 58s2 0 42s1 qu pred s2 si values are 9 91 9 56 8 20 and 6 04 respectively these predicted data are presented in fig 13 and show similar trend with observed data for the same models 9 2 numerical modelling the typical fig 15 a and b depict the comparison between non dimensional pull out resistance vs relative displacement obtained from physical and numerical modelling these ensure the authenticity of the present numerical investigation from the figures a reasonably good agreement can be noticed between observed and numerical findings so the typical figs 16 18 reveal that the data of numerical analysis in reference with embedment ratios l db diameter ratios ds db and bell angle β can be adopted for parametric study with confidence in typical figs 19 and 20 the total displacement contours obtained from the numerical modelling are compared with observed non linear failure surfaces to ensure the validity of the present numerical investigation in s1 s2 as well as s2 s1 deposit so in this present study for shallow embedment ratios of 3 4 and 5 the breakout wedge is initiated from the edge of anchor base gradually progress upward and ended to sand surface from the figures a reasonable good agreement can be observed between experimental and numerical findings the figures present reasonably good agreement between observed and numerical non linear failure surfaces with the increase in height above the anchor bases in the slip surfaces the non linearity increases in bottom layer but after the crossing of the sand layers interface non linearity decreases in the top layer in s1 s2 deposit in s2 s1 deposit with the increase in height above the anchor bases in the slip surfaces the non linearity increases in a bottom layer but after the crossing of the sand layers interface non linearity increases more in the top layer a similar mechanism is involved for sand failure in both the layered sand deposits the induced overburden pressure on anchor base results in confinement of sand close to the zone of anchor base subsequently confines dilation of sand as well as the horizontal extension of failure points near anchor base near to sand surface overburden pressure progressively reduces and due to dilatancy of sand expansions of failure points are increased in horizontal direction irrespective of sand strata 10 validation of observed data and practical applications fig 21 shows the plot of observed pull out resistance qu s1 s2 and qu s2 s1 vs predicted pull out resistance qu pred s1 s2 and qu pred s2 s1 among 96 numbers of qu pred s1 s2 and qu pred s2 s1 data total 93 data are with the range of 10 72 to 09 83 variation in respect to qu s1 s2 and qu s2 s1 this study may simulate conditions a where the ground water table is very low and b ground water is temporarily lowered down to facilitate constructional operations and c the sand media has some cementation property in absence of field investigation an ideal knowledge and simulation of the soil profile in the laboratory as well as application of horizontal slice method on most probable slip surface may be helpful for the geotechnical engineers to rationally predict pull out resistance as the tests are conducted in the laboratory on a few numbers of belled anchor models and panels in layered sand having properties narrowed by variation so the described method and equations should be verified and revise consequently when different types of soil of wide variety of geotechnical properties will be met in a construction site a number of investigations on pull out resistance of belled anchor are available for ranges of embedment ratios and diameter ratios and numbers of formulations are given for plate anchors in homogeneous sand deposit in literature whereas the study on pull out resistance of belled anchor in layered sand with a ranges of thickness ratios of sand layers are virtually nil so the present study generates almost a new solution for the ranges of characteristics of belled anchor the present experimental and analytical results cannot validate with previous results but the non dimensional pull out resistance and non linear behaviour of slip surfaces for small scale laboratory models are very close and following the similar trend likewise the comparatively larger models λ 1 10 as revealed from the data of finite element analysis for the same embedment ratio anchor characteristics and foundation properties there may be some differences between the results of the numerical modelling and laboratory experiments because the experiments in laboratory are conducted with 1g laboratory models in well controlled soil and model conditions the numerical model analysis is dependent on element size and shapes distribution of cluster and mesh refinement the method of programming is completely based on iterations and matrix through mathematical operations the numerically obtained non dimensional pull out resistance are within the range of 02 15 to 8 45 variation with respect to the observed data though in field there may be chances of manual error environmental errors and machinery errors up to some extent the in situ investigation results are preferable to compare with the data of laboratory investigations but the in situ investigations on pull out resistance of single belled anchor pile in two layered sand deposits are virtually nil so a comparative study between the proposed method and the in situ investigation is difficult so in the present study in the finite element package large scale numerical aspects with scale factor λ 1 10 is considered to relate with the practical field 11 summary and concluding remarks on the basis of observed data of pull out resistance observation and analysis of slip surfaces to numerate pull out resistance and discussions the following findings are noteworthy and have listed below gradually higher pull out resistance of belled anchors are achieved for higher l db and lesser ds db values in both layered sand deposits the 45 54 and 63 belled anchors are found to be more capable of resisting pull out force than 72 anchors in both layered sand deposits in this study it is found that nu s1 s2 is comparatively higher than nu s2 s1 for the same model and this trend is consistent for increasing values of l db and decreasing values of ds db and β all the slip surfaces are showing a similar trend in the failure mechanism they have developed from the edge of anchor base and completed at sand surface to the maximum horizontal extent regardless of the type of sand deposits values of ws wb l wb and β in s1 s2 deposit the failure curves are concave inward and in s2 s1 deposit the failure curves are convex outward in pattern in each model the values of nu pred s1 s2 and nu pred s2 s1 are gradually higher with increasing l db and decreasing ws wb and β the summation of dead weight of sand inside the wedge and frictional shear on the surfaces of the break out sand zones are higher in s1 s2 than s2 s1 deposit for the same model and this trend is consistent for all models with respect to l wb ws wb and β out of 96 numbers of predicted data total 93 data are within the range of 10 72 to 09 83 variations in respect of the observed results the non dimensionalised pull out resistance and non linear behaviour of slip surfaces for small scale laboratory models are very close and following the similar trend likewise the comparatively larger models λ 1 10 as revealed from the data of plaxis 3d foudation fe analysis for the same embedment ratios anchor characteristics and foundation

21968,as an emerging technology to harness the marine current energy tidal stream turbine tst systems have been developed due to high predictability and energy density in tidal current resources however considering that various challenges such as swell disturbances unknown disturbances or parameter uncertainties may deteriorate the system performance it is interesting to investigate alternative control strategies to the conventional proportional integral pi controls in this paper the active disturbance rejection control adrc approach is proposed to replace pi controllers in the conventional generator side control scheme in this approach two adrc schemes cascaded and second order adrc strategies are respectively applied and compared to achieve mppt under current velocity and turbine torque disturbances performances of the proposed adrc approaches are compared to pi and sliding mode control strategies energy production during swell wave disturbance is also evaluated under these control strategies the comparisons show that the cascaded adrc has better performance than the second order approach moreover the cascaded adrc is tested under parameter variations to evaluate its robustness the carried out simulation based comparative study shows the effectiveness and advantages of the cascaded adrc strategy over conventional pi controller in terms of fast convergence overshoots elimination and improved robustness under disturbances and parameter uncertainties keywords tidal stream turbine disturbance rejection control maximum power point tracking robustness 1 introduction tidal stream turbine tst generation systems based on similar principles of wind power systems have been developed to generate electricity from tidal driven currents during the last decades advantages of tst generation systems are related to the high predictability in hourly time scale and high energy density of the tidal driven currents bahaj 2011 benelghali et al 2007 although challenges such as submarine installation and maintenance do exit tst generation systems are still considered to be a promising power supplying solution for some remote islands or coastal areas in fact various demonstrative tst projects have been successfully industrialized and they are entering the pre commercial stage zhou et al 2017 chen et al 2018 for achieving compact structure and reducing maintenance requirements several tst projects adopt turbines with nonpitchable blades and choose permanent magnet synchronous machine as generator touimi et al 2018 the power harnessed by a tst is generally proportional to the cubic marine current velocity and the turbine power coefficient for a turbine with fixed pitch blades the turbine power coefficient c p depends on the tip speed ratio tsr which can be controlled by the generator rotational speed therefore speed control in tst generation system can be necessary in order to capture maximum power under the varying marine current speed a previous study in zhou et al 2013 shows that under strong swell wave disturbances a speed control with filter based reference or a torque based control can achieve smoother produced power however in that work only classical proportional integral pi controllers are used and other kind of disturbances such as sudden current flow velocity change and unpredictable turbine mechanical torque changes are not considered although pid control is the most popular control strategy in industrial applications due to its simple structure and relative easy parameter tuning it may suffer several drawbacks such as 1 the controller implementation is often done without the derivative part d due to noise sensitivity 2 slow response or overshoot caused by the integration action 3 controller parameter tuning usually requires accurate plant model and parameters which may be unavailable or present uncertainties under different operation conditions to improve the transient performance of pid controllers system identification and intelligent techniques are introduced åström and hagglund 2001 fuzzy pid controllers can have better performances with adaptive controller gains however the design of membership function and rule sets could be difficult and complex kumar et al 2011 duan et al 2013 in modern control there are several advanced control strategies which are interesting the model predictive control mpc and linear quadratic regulator lqr require analysis of the space state model of the plant they have good performance around the steady state operating point but are not robust and could be sensitive to unmodeled dynamics and external disturbances imura et al 2011 cheema et al 2016 as a group of variable structure controllers higher order sliding hosm controllers are considered as a powerful control tool for nonlinear systems under parameter uncertainties hosm is developed to reduce chattering which is caused by unmodeled dynamics that increase the relative degree of the plant levant 2007 in various hosm control laws high order time derivatives of the sliding variable are often required however measuring high order derivatives in practice is often with high noises and not feasible in this case high order finite time convergent observer based on the symbolic function should be used levant 2003 the choice of the control laws and parameter tuning of the hosm could be difficult when the boundary conditions of the variation range or variation rate of certain system parameters are unavailable in gao et al 2001 han 2009 huang et al 2014 a relatively new design structure for controllers namely active disturbance rejection control adrc was proposed adrc is not based on plant model analysis because system behaviors could change unexpectedly in practice under disturbances and the plant models may therefore become unreliable as an emerging approach adrc uses a controller observer pair to treat external and internal disturbances plant parameter variations or uncertainties as an element not to be modeled analytically but to be rejected as a generalized total disturbance in this way the control signal responds directly to cancel the total disturbance and thus making the controller design almost model free gao 2015 linear adrc ladrc enables to apply parameter tuning methods based on close loop bandwidth and observer bandwidth according to desired frequency or time domain performances li et al 2012 wang et al 2019 however the study in ahi and haeri 2018 shows that the limitation of sensor bandwidth could degrade the closed loop performance of the lardc various parameter uncertainties and external disturbances exist in pm machines a comprehensive overview on disturbance and uncertainty estimation and attenuation duea techniques including adrc is given in yang et al 2017 it shows that duea has a better balance among performances compared to other robust control and adaption control methods in zuo et al 2019 guo et al 2017 ardc are applied to the speed controller of pm machines however pi controllers are still used in the current loops in a recent work zhou et al 2019 adrc was applied on a laboratory scaled small pm machine and compared to pi and sm controls although the comparison carried out in zhou et al 2019 is of some interest there were several issues such as the size of the used pm machine that does not fit tidal stream turbine systems power level for deployment adrc was only applied in the speed control loop and the robustness issue has not been addressed while it is a critical issue in a marine context i e parameter variations all these issues will be addressed in this work while a control alternative namely a second order adrc approach will be developed and compared to the proposed cascaded adrc approach fig 1 shows a classical double loop control scheme of a permanent magnet synchronous generator pmsg the current loop control is usually based on pi controllers and the speed controller can be either pi controller or other advanced controller in order to fully benefit from the adrc strategies advantages an all adrc approach as shown in fig 2 is proposed in this work in this approach all the controllers both in speed and current loops are designed by adrc strategies in the proposed cascaded adrc approach the decoupling terms in the classical pi current control loops are not needed and thus the dependence of system parameters can be reduced using a higher order adrc controller to combine the speed adrc controller and the q axis adrc current controller can achieve a possible variant of this adrc approach nonlinear ardc controllers are applied in this work to fully maintain the advantages of large error small gain small error large gain compared to ladrc the proposed all adrc approach is applied to a 500 kw tst generation system to achieve the mppt task under different kinds of disturbances and parameter variations in section ii the pmsg based tst system model and classical controller design for the tst generation system are presented then the proposed adrc approach and the controller design are presented in section iii in section iv simulation results of different control strategies under tidal current speed and turbine torque disturbances are compared energy production performance under swell effect is also presented in section v parameter uncertainties are applied to verify the proposed adrc robustness section vi gives the conclusion 2 classical control for a tst system the mechanical power extracted by a tst can be calculated by the following equation 1 p 1 2 ρ c p λ π r 2 v t i d e 3 in 1 the seawater density ρ and the turbine radius r are constants v tide is the velocity of marine tidal current c p is the turbine power coefficient for a given turbine the c p curve may be approximated as a function of the pitch angle and the tip speed ratio λ the considered tst is a fixed pitch blade one therefore c p depends only on λ for typical mct prototypes the optimal c p value is estimated to be in the range of 0 39 0 45 zhou et al 2017 fig 3 shows the c p curve used in this work the maximum c p value is 0 41 which corresponds to a tip speed ratio of 6 3 this value is considered as the optimal tip speed ratio λ opt 6 3 for obtaining the maximal c p value under varying tidal current condition a basic mppt control can be realized by controlling the generator speed to regulate the turbine rotational speed according to tidal current velocity the speed reference for the generator can be given by 2 for the considered direct driven tst 2 ω m λ o p t v t i d e r for the pmsg the d q frame model is described by 3 3 v d r s i d l d d i d dt ω e l q i q v q r s i q l q d i q dt ω e l d i d ω e ψ m t e 3 2 n

torques n p is the generator pole pair number ψm is the flux linkage created by the rotor permanent magnets j is the total system inertia and f b is the friction coefficient associated to the mechanical drivetrain a 500 kw tst system is considered in this work and the system parameters are given in the appendix in the classical control scheme shown in fig 1 the current loop response is much faster than the speed response and the current controller tuning is usually easier than the speed controller therefore pi control are applied for the two current loops in this section and then two different control strategies pi and sliding mode sm control will be applied to the speed controller the controllers should be well tuned to serve as a sound base for later comparison with the proposed adrc strategies 2 1 proportional integral control the tuning of the two pi controllers shown in fig 1 in the current loops is to be presented firstly same parameters can be used for both pi current controllers due to the similar dynamics for i d and i q loops the open loop transfer function of the pi control based current loop can be expressed as 4 g 0 s k p c τ i c s 1 τ i c s 1 r s l s r s s 1 t σ i s 1 with k pc and k i c 1 τ i c as the current loop controller gains and t σ i which is much smaller than the electrical time constant l s r s as a small time constant standing for current sensor and power converter delays based on the dominant pole cancelation method and with a desired damping factor 0 707 in this work for the close loop transfer function the following controller gains can be chosen for the current loop pi controllers 5 k i c r s l s k p c r s 2 t σ i k i c the speed controller will generate the q axis current reference i q the d axis current reference i d can be set to 0 for maximizing the electromagnetic torque for a given stator current the pi speed controller parameters can be tuned by many ways and in this work the non symmetrical optimum method nsom is chosen as one analytical method the nsom relies on a second order approximated model of the plant with a generalized time constant t q 1 ω q which includes all the time delays in the speed loop and k q which represents the slope rate of open loop step response these two parameters can be deduced from a series of step response tests in simulation or in practice by the nsom the parameters of the pi speed controller can be obtained from ane and loron 2006 as follows 6 k p s γ c ω q k q α c k i s ω q α c in 6 the correcting gain fact γ c is defined in terms of the desired resonant peak value m c the parameter α c is calculated by a phase advance δϕ which depends on γ c more details of the nsom tuning procedure can be found in zhou 2014 2 2 sliding mode speed control to improve the pmsg speed control performance hosm can be applied benelghali et al 2011 liang et al 2017 phan and huang 2015 in this work the super twisting sliding mode control strategy is applied to the speed controller as an alternative to the pi one the sliding variable is defined as the speed tracking error 7 s 1 e ω m ω m and the controller output is calculated by 8 u i q k 1 s 1 0 5 sign s 1 k 2 sign s 1 the lower limits of the gains k 1 and k 2 for the super twisting control law can be calculated with bounding information of certain parameters variation range and variation rate fridman and levant 2002 generally higher gains are needed to cover higher parameter uncertainty and larger disturbances in this work k 1 1200 and k 2 500 are chosen for the studied tst system 3 adrc alternative approach for the tst system 3 1 active disturbance rejection control from the previous pi speed controller tuning procedure it can be noted that the pi gains relay on the knowledge of plant parameters or require some tests to obtain an approximate plant model however disturbances or nonlinear dynamics are not considered in pi controller designs to overcome these drawbacks adrc uses a nonlinear controller nlc with an extended state observer eso to obtain fast convergence and effective disturbance rejection a stand formulation for applying adrc is based on a canonical state space expression of the plant with the total disturbance as an extended state variable the adrc controller order depends on the derivative order of the target variable to be controlled zhou et al 2019 the first order derivation of the plant output y can be formulated by 9 x 1 f b u y x 1 in 9 u is the plant input b is a constant and f represents the total disturbance which combines all the known dynamics and unknown disturbances then f is treated as an extended state variable x 2 to be estimated by the eso the first order adrc controller diagram is illustrated by fig 4 in this figure e is the tracking error b 0 is a roughly estimated value of the constant b of the plant described in 9 and the eso has two outputs z 1 is an estimation of the plant output y and z 2 is the estimated total disturbance f the nonlinear function called fal is applied in the adrc 10 f a l x α δ x α sign x x δ x δ 1 α x δ with x as the main input representing some kind of error information 0 α 1 enables the function value to have a reducing effect with large x input and δ 0 introduces a linear zone to avoid too big function value for small x around 0 the eso of the adrc can then be constructed as 11 ε z 1 y z 1 z 2 b 0 u β 1 f a l ε α 1 δ z 2 β 2 f a l ε α 2 δ with β 1 β 2 as the eso gains the nlc is given as u 0 k 1 f a l e α 0 δ with k 1 as the controller gain the adrc controller output is u u 0 z 2 b 0 it is also possible to move the block 1 b 0 on the z 2 signal channel in fig 4 and thus making the controller output u u 0 z 2 b 0 this could be helpful to reduce the nlc output u 0 and its controller gain k 1 when the constant b 0 is very large 3 2 cascaded adrc control in the proposed cascaded adrc control for the tidal stream turbine generation system fig 2 the current loop adrc controllers are constructed based on the first order derivation of the d q axis currents 12 i d 1 l d r s i d ω e l q i q 1 l d v d i q 1 l q r s i q ω e l d i d ω e ψ m 1 l q v q when comparing 12 with the standard formula 9 it can be seen that for the surface mounted pmsg l d l q l s the constant b 1 l s is the same for the dynamic model of d q axis currents although the total disturbance f has different expressions in d q current loops the same adrc current controller can be used for both current loops for the reason that the total disturbance f does not need to be known or modeled but it can be estimated by the eso in this case only the basic knowledge of b 0 1 l s is required for the adrc current controller applying the adrc approach the q axis current controller is designed as 13 and the d axis current controller can be constructed in the same way 13 ε z 1 i q z 1 z 2 1 l s u β 1 c f a l ε 0 5 2 z 2 β 2 c f a l ε 0 25 2 e i q z 1 u 0 k 1 c f a l e 0 5 2 u u 0 l s z 2 v q in 13 the first three equations are the eso in the adrc current controller to estimate the current by z 1 and the total disturbance of the concerned current loop by z 2 the last three equations describe the nlc and the output of the adrc current controller the eso and nlc gains of the adrc current controller are tuned intuitively by trial and error as β1c 90000 β2c 60000 k 1c 150 for the speed controller the variable to be controlled is the generator rotor speed y ω m and the controller output is the q axis current reference u i q based on the first order derivative of the rotor speed 14 ω m t m j f b ω m j 1 5 n p ψ m j i q the adrc speed controller can be designed as follows 15 ε s z 1 ω m z 1 z 2 b 0 s u β 1 s f a l ε s 0 5 0 01 z 2 β 2 s f a l ε s 0 25 0 01 e s ω m ω m u 0 k 1 s f a l e s 0 3 0 01 u u 0 z 2 b 0 s i q in 15 the constant b 0s is set close to or equal to the constant b 1 5 n p ψ m j as found in 14 it should be noted that the adrc speed controller does not need accurate plant model which means that the unknown disturbances or variations of the mechanical torque friction coefficient rotational speed and the system inertia can be generalized as the total disturbance and estimated inside the eso of the adrc due to the fact that the dynamics of the speed loop is much slower than the current loop and considering a quite important system inertia for the studied 500 kw pmsg based tst system j 4 359 10 4 kg m 2 the eso gains β 1s β 2s should be much smaller than those of the current controller the eso and nlc gains of the adrc speed controller are tuned by simulation as β1s 36 β2s 3 k 1s 20 3 3 second order adrc control there exists a possibility to merge the cascaded speed adrc controller and the q axis adrc controller into 1 s order adrc speed controller if the second order derivation of the rotor speed is formulated as 16 ω m f k t j l q v q f t m j f b ω m j k t j l q r s i q ω e l d i d ω e ψ m d in 16 k t 1 5 n p ψ m is the pmsg torque constant f is the total disturbance to be estimated and rejected by the second order adrc d represents unknown disturbances based on the basic structure of a second order adrc proposed in han 2009 the second order speed controller for the pmsg based tst can be designed as follows 17 ε s z 1 ω m z 1 z 2 β 1 ε s z 2 z 3 b 0 u β 2 f a l ε s 0 9 0 01 z 3 β 3 f a l ε s 0 9 0 01 e 1 ω m ω m e 2 e 1 u 0 k 1 f a l e 1 0 5 0 01 k 2 f a l e 2 1 1 0 01 u u 0 z 3 b 0 v q in 17 the constant b 0 can be set as k t j l s the derivative of the tracking error can be approximately calculated by 18 with τ1 0 001 and τ2 0 0015 to avoid direct differentiation of the tracking error which may contain noises or sharp variations z 1 z 2 and z 3 are the estimations of the rotor speed its derivative and the total disturbance respectively β 1 β 2 and β 3 are the eso gains and k 1 and k 2 are the nlc gains of the second order adrc controller 18 e 2 1 τ 2 τ 1 1 τ 1 s 1 1 τ 2 s 1 e 1 although the second order adrc speed controller enables to generate v q directly from speed tracking error this approach involves a more complicated controller design and large gains have to be used in the eso because the total disturbance needed to be estimated by the second order adrc is greatly increased compared to the first order one 4 simulation and comparative study in this section a 500 kw direct driven pmsg based tst system parameters are listed in the appendix is studied the proposed cascaded adrc approach will be compared with the second order adrc approach the classical pi control approach and the hybrid speed sliding mode plus pi current control strategy these four control strategies are shortened as adrc adrc2 pi and sm in the following comparison study 4 1 control performance evaluation under disturbances of current velocity and torque in this part the current velocity is considered as a constant value of 2 m s during 15s a sudden current velocity fall with 0 7 m s as the peak is applied during 6 6 6s and a large turbine torque thrust of 140knm equivalent to the nominal torque of the pmsg is added at 11 11 5s the speed performance of the adrc approach during the entire 15s will be firstly illustrated and then comparisons with other control methods will be carried out in different time periods fig 5 shows that the rotor speed response under the proposed adrc control strategy converges to the speed reference calculated by mppt very rapidly a rate limiter block is added at the reference speed so that step speed changes can be avoided therefore at the starting stage the speed follows a slop reference during the tidal current disturbance and the turbine mechanical torque disturbance periods the tracking error is about 0 03 rad s and 0 01 rad s which are lower than 1 3 of the steady state speed of 2 377 rad s to compare the adrc performance with other approaches smaller time scales should be used fig 6 compares the rotor speed response during the startup stage it can be observed that the pi approach leads to an overshoot of 0 21 rad s which is 8 8 of the steady state speed the sm approach enables reducing the overshoot to 3 0 08 rad s ardc has fastest convergent speed with a negligible overshoot of 0 13 ardc2 presents no overshoot while it leads some small steady state errors and oscillations than the other approaches fig 7 shows that under the current velocity drop disturbance all the four control approaches are capable to follow a dropping speed reference however when the disturbance is cleared at 6 6s the speed reference has a quick rise to its steady state value in this case pi shows the biggest overshoot and longest settle time among other approaches sm shows a smoother and quicker convergent speed compared with pi while adrc and adrc2 have the fastest convergent speed when the disturbance is cleared although the speed performances of adrc and adrc2 are very similar it should be noted that adrc2 presents small fluctuations which are caused by torque fluctuations due to the reason that adrc2 has no q axis current control loop during the torque disturbance the speed reference is not changed which means that the ideal rotor speed should keep at the steady state value of 2 377 rad s fig 8 illustrates that the sudden rise of the turbine mechanical torque at 11s leads to a speed rising and the clearance of the disturbance at 11 5s causes a speed dropping for pi and sm while sm has less fluctuation and a quick performance recovering than the pi approach both adrc and adrc2 achieve the smallest tracking error and no speed drop error at the clearance of the disturbance at 11 5s during the torque disturbance adrc has a maximum tracking error about 0 007 rad s as also shown in fig 5 adrc2 seems to have even smaller error compared to adrc however speed fluctuations can be seen with adrc2 fig 9 shows that adrc2 leads to bigger torque fluctuations and this explains why speed fluctuations exist in adrc2 this reveals the drawback of adrc2 due to the lack of a q axis current control loop in order to further investigate the control performance speed tracking of the above evaluated strategies two performance indices ise integral of the square error and itae integral of the time weighted absolute error are evaluated they are given by levine 1996 19 i s e t 1 t 2 e 2 t d t 20 i t a e t 1 t 2 t t 1 e t d t in 19 and 20 e t is the speed tracking error t 1 and t 2 represent the time interval of the studied operating stages the ise emphasizes on large overshoot or excessively underdamped behaviors a small ise value usually indicates a good capability of large error suppression the itae emphasizes on both initial response error and persistent errors a low itae can therefore reflect a satisfactory general error suppression performance during the duration of interest itae has been also used to tune pid controller parameters awouda and mamat 2010 or evaluate a controller performance dahiya et al 2017 in our case both ise and itae are calculated for the three specific operating stages starting stage 1s 1 5s current velocity disturbance stage 6s 7 5s and torque disturbance stage 11s 12 5s the achieved performance indices are listed in table 1 based on the calculated performance indices it has been found that for the starting stage adrc has the lowest ise and itae values which demonstrate that it has a best error suppression capability sm has a little higher ise and itae values than pi for the reason that a smooth response may lead to a lower error suppression speed in terms of error integration index this result is coherent with the simulation results shown in fig 6 during current velocity disturbance and torque disturbance stages adrc2 leads to the smallest ise and itae values and adrc has very similar results that are much smaller than those of sm and pi it should be also noted that during the disturbance stages sm could have smaller itae values than pi this means that nonlinear controllers such adrc and sm can have generally better disturbance rejection capabilities than constant parameters pi ones although adrc2 seems slightly better than adrc according to the index values during the disturbances stages it should be pointed out that adrc2 suffers from the lack of a torque loop control q axis current loop and therefore the resulted torque fluctuations are slightly reflected in the speed tracking error due to the system inertia filtering effect these observations show that ise and itae are interesting indices to evaluate a controller tracking performance in this context the speed tracking error suppression capability of the proposed adrc approach is well validated by these performance indices 4 2 control performance evaluation under swell wave disturbances swell waves are identified as the main cause of short time power fluctuations in tst generation systems zhou et al 2013 fig 10 shows the simulated marine current speed under swell effect after 4s fig 11 illustrates the rotor speed response and its tracking error by the proposed cascaded adrc approach it can be observed that the adrc approach realizes a very good speed tracking under swell induced disturbances with negligible tracking errors fig 12 compares the energy production calculated by the integration of generator power under swell disturbance by different control strategies studied in this work at the end of the simulation 60s it can be observed that the energy yielding by pi control is about 2736 wh sm and adrc2 lead to a slightly better energy yielding with 2737 5 wh and adrc leads to a best yielding of 2738 wh 5 adrc under system parameter variations when the generator resistance r s and inductance l s values are changed the current loop tracking performances are mainly concerned figs 13 and 14 show the tracking errors of q axis current under r s variations 20 and 500 and l s variations 50 and 200 large increase of resistance and inductance will cause current pulses while the performances after 0 5s are quite similar compared to the original parameter case this illustrates the robustness of the adrc current controller fig 15 shows the speed responses under different system inertia smaller inertia will increase the speed loop dynamics and make the speed control easier larger system inertia requires higher torque to keep the speed rising rate however the q axis current which directly contributes to the torque is limited by 2 times of nominal current and this explains the increased tracking error at the starting stage in the 200 inertia case adrc works very well to converge the speed to the steady state value rapidly and results in no speed overshoot 6 conclusions in this paper the cascaded adrc approach was proposed to enhance the control performance of a pmsg based tidal stream turbine an alternative namely a second order adrc was also investigated the adrc strategy has clearly shown key features such a lesser dependency on plant model analysis and efficient disturbance rejection capabilities the carried out simulations and the achieved results have clearly illustrated the effectiveness of the proposed adrc strategy under various disturbance conditions while being compared to conventional pi and hybrid sliding mode pi control strategies this work has also shown that the cascaded adrc achieves better performance than the second order adrc in terms of smoothed torque performance indices namely itae and ise have been evaluated for three specific operating conditions the achieved results have clearly confirmed that the proposed adrc approach outperforms the pi and hybrid sliding mode pi control strategies robustness against system parameter variations has also been investigated and verified for the cascaded adrc approach it has been particularly shown that the proposed adrc approach enables slightly improving a tidal stream turbine system energy production during swell wave disturbance

21968,as an emerging technology to harness the marine current energy tidal stream turbine tst systems have been developed due to high predictability and energy density in tidal current resources however considering that various challenges such as swell disturbances unknown disturbances or parameter uncertainties may deteriorate the system performance it is interesting to investigate alternative control strategies to the conventional proportional integral pi controls in this paper the active disturbance rejection control adrc approach is proposed to replace pi controllers in the conventional generator side control scheme in this approach two adrc schemes cascaded and second order adrc strategies are respectively applied and compared to achieve mppt under current velocity and turbine torque disturbances performances of the proposed adrc approaches are compared to pi and sliding mode control strategies energy production during swell wave disturbance is also evaluated under these control strategies the comparisons show that the cascaded adrc has better performance than the second order approach moreover the cascaded adrc is tested under parameter variations to evaluate its robustness the carried out simulation based comparative study shows the effectiveness and advantages of the cascaded adrc strategy over conventional pi controller in terms of fast convergence overshoots elimination and improved robustness under disturbances and parameter uncertainties keywords tidal stream turbine disturbance rejection control maximum power point tracking robustness 1 introduction tidal stream turbine tst generation systems based on similar principles of wind power systems have been developed to generate electricity from tidal driven currents during the last decades advantages of tst generation systems are related to the high predictability in hourly time scale and high energy density of the tidal driven currents bahaj 2011 benelghali et al 2007 although challenges such as submarine installation and maintenance do exit tst generation systems are still considered to be a promising power supplying solution for some remote islands or coastal areas in fact various demonstrative tst projects have been successfully industrialized and they are entering the pre commercial stage zhou et al 2017 chen et al 2018 for achieving compact structure and reducing maintenance requirements several tst projects adopt turbines with nonpitchable blades and choose permanent magnet synchronous machine as generator touimi et al 2018 the power harnessed by a tst is generally proportional to the cubic marine current velocity and the turbine power coefficient for a turbine with fixed pitch blades the turbine power coefficient c p depends on the tip speed ratio tsr which can be controlled by the generator rotational speed therefore speed control in tst generation system can be necessary in order to capture maximum power under the varying marine current speed a previous study in zhou et al 2013 shows that under strong swell wave disturbances a speed control with filter based reference or a torque based control can achieve smoother produced power however in that work only classical proportional integral pi controllers are used and other kind of disturbances such as sudden current flow velocity change and unpredictable turbine mechanical torque changes are not considered although pid control is the most popular control strategy in industrial applications due to its simple structure and relative easy parameter tuning it may suffer several drawbacks such as 1 the controller implementation is often done without the derivative part d due to noise sensitivity 2 slow response or overshoot caused by the integration action 3 controller parameter tuning usually requires accurate plant model and parameters which may be unavailable or present uncertainties under different operation conditions to improve the transient performance of pid controllers system identification and intelligent techniques are introduced åström and hagglund 2001 fuzzy pid controllers can have better performances with adaptive controller gains however the design of membership function and rule sets could be difficult and complex kumar et al 2011 duan et al 2013 in modern control there are several advanced control strategies which are interesting the model predictive control mpc and linear quadratic regulator lqr require analysis of the space state model of the plant they have good performance around the steady state operating point but are not robust and could be sensitive to unmodeled dynamics and external disturbances imura et al 2011 cheema et al 2016 as a group of variable structure controllers higher order sliding hosm controllers are considered as a powerful control tool for nonlinear systems under parameter uncertainties hosm is developed to reduce chattering which is caused by unmodeled dynamics that increase the relative degree of the plant levant 2007 in various hosm control laws high order time derivatives of the sliding variable are often required however measuring high order derivatives in practice is often with high noises and not feasible in this case high order finite time convergent observer based on the symbolic function should be used levant 2003 the choice of the control laws and parameter tuning of the hosm could be difficult when the boundary conditions of the variation range or variation rate of certain system parameters are unavailable in gao et al 2001 han 2009 huang et al 2014 a relatively new design structure for controllers namely active disturbance rejection control adrc was proposed adrc is not based on plant model analysis because system behaviors could change unexpectedly in practice under disturbances and the plant models may therefore become unreliable as an emerging approach adrc uses a controller observer pair to treat external and internal disturbances plant parameter variations or uncertainties as an element not to be modeled analytically but to be rejected as a generalized total disturbance in this way the control signal responds directly to cancel the total disturbance and thus making the controller design almost model free gao 2015 linear adrc ladrc enables to apply parameter tuning methods based on close loop bandwidth and observer bandwidth according to desired frequency or time domain performances li et al 2012 wang et al 2019 however the study in ahi and haeri 2018 shows that the limitation of sensor bandwidth could degrade the closed loop performance of the lardc various parameter uncertainties and external disturbances exist in pm machines a comprehensive overview on disturbance and uncertainty estimation and attenuation duea techniques including adrc is given in yang et al 2017 it shows that duea has a better balance among performances compared to other robust control and adaption control methods in zuo et al 2019 guo et al 2017 ardc are applied to the speed controller of pm machines however pi controllers are still used in the current loops in a recent work zhou et al 2019 adrc was applied on a laboratory scaled small pm machine and compared to pi and sm controls although the comparison carried out in zhou et al 2019 is of some interest there were several issues such as the size of the used pm machine that does not fit tidal stream turbine systems power level for deployment adrc was only applied in the speed control loop and the robustness issue has not been addressed while it is a critical issue in a marine context i e parameter variations all these issues will be addressed in this work while a control alternative namely a second order adrc approach will be developed and compared to the proposed cascaded adrc approach fig 1 shows a classical double loop control scheme of a permanent magnet synchronous generator pmsg the current loop control is usually based on pi controllers and the speed controller can be either pi controller or other advanced controller in order to fully benefit from the adrc strategies advantages an all adrc approach as shown in fig 2 is proposed in this work in this approach all the controllers both in speed and current loops are designed by adrc strategies in the proposed cascaded adrc approach the decoupling terms in the classical pi current control loops are not needed and thus the dependence of system parameters can be reduced using a higher order adrc controller to combine the speed adrc controller and the q axis adrc current controller can achieve a possible variant of this adrc approach nonlinear ardc controllers are applied in this work to fully maintain the advantages of large error small gain small error large gain compared to ladrc the proposed all adrc approach is applied to a 500 kw tst generation system to achieve the mppt task under different kinds of disturbances and parameter variations in section ii the pmsg based tst system model and classical controller design for the tst generation system are presented then the proposed adrc approach and the controller design are presented in section iii in section iv simulation results of different control strategies under tidal current speed and turbine torque disturbances are compared energy production performance under swell effect is also presented in section v parameter uncertainties are applied to verify the proposed adrc robustness section vi gives the conclusion 2 classical control for a tst system the mechanical power extracted by a tst can be calculated by the following equation 1 p 1 2 ρ c p λ π r 2 v t i d e 3 in 1 the seawater density ρ and the turbine radius r are constants v tide is the velocity of marine tidal current c p is the turbine power coefficient for a given turbine the c p curve may be approximated as a function of the pitch angle and the tip speed ratio λ the considered tst is a fixed pitch blade one therefore c p depends only on λ for typical mct prototypes the optimal c p value is estimated to be in the range of 0 39 0 45 zhou et al 2017 fig 3 shows the c p curve used in this work the maximum c p value is 0 41 which corresponds to a tip speed ratio of 6 3 this value is considered as the optimal tip speed ratio λ opt 6 3 for obtaining the maximal c p value under varying tidal current condition a basic mppt control can be realized by controlling the generator speed to regulate the turbine rotational speed according to tidal current velocity the speed reference for the generator can be given by 2 for the

much faster than the speed response and the current controller tuning is usually easier than the speed controller therefore pi control are applied for the two current loops in this section and then two different control strategies pi and sliding mode sm control will be applied to the speed controller the controllers should be well tuned to serve as a sound base for later comparison with the proposed adrc strategies 2 1 proportional integral control the tuning of the two pi controllers shown in fig 1 in the current loops is to be presented firstly same parameters can be used for both pi current controllers due to the similar dynamics for i d and i q loops the open loop transfer function of the pi control based current loop can be expressed as 4 g 0 s k p c τ i c s 1 τ i c s 1 r s l s r s s 1 t σ i s 1 with k pc and k i c 1 τ i c as the current loop controller gains and t σ i which is much smaller than the electrical time constant l s r s as a small time constant standing for current sensor and power converter delays based on the dominant pole cancelation method and with a desired damping factor 0 707 in this work for the close loop transfer function the following controller gains can be chosen for the current loop pi controllers 5 k i c r s l s k p c r s 2 t σ i k i c the speed controller will generate the q axis current reference i q the d axis current reference i d can be set to 0 for maximizing the electromagnetic torque for a given stator current the pi speed controller parameters can be tuned by many ways and in this work the non symmetrical optimum method nsom is chosen as one analytical method the nsom relies on a second order approximated model of the plant with a generalized time constant t q 1 ω q which includes all the time delays in the speed loop and k q which represents the slope rate of open loop step response these two parameters can be deduced from a series of step response tests in simulation or in practice by the nsom the parameters of the pi speed controller can be obtained from ane and loron 2006 as follows 6 k p s γ c ω q k q α c k i s ω q α c in 6 the correcting gain fact γ c is defined in terms of the desired resonant peak value m c the parameter α c is calculated by a phase advance δϕ which depends on γ c more details of the nsom tuning procedure can be found in zhou 2014 2 2 sliding mode speed control to improve the pmsg speed control performance hosm can be applied benelghali et al 2011 liang et al 2017 phan and huang 2015 in this work the super twisting sliding mode control strategy is applied to the speed controller as an alternative to the pi one the sliding variable is defined as the speed tracking error 7 s 1 e ω m ω m and the controller output is calculated by 8 u i q k 1 s 1 0 5 sign s 1 k 2 sign s 1 the lower limits of the gains k 1 and k 2 for the super twisting control law can be calculated with bounding information of certain parameters variation range and variation rate fridman and levant 2002 generally higher gains are needed to cover higher parameter uncertainty and larger disturbances in this work k 1 1200 and k 2 500 are chosen for the studied tst system 3 adrc alternative approach for the tst system 3 1 active disturbance rejection control from the previous pi speed controller tuning procedure it can be noted that the pi gains relay on the knowledge of plant parameters or require some tests to obtain an approximate plant model however disturbances or nonlinear dynamics are not considered in pi controller designs to overcome these drawbacks adrc uses a nonlinear controller nlc with an extended state observer eso to obtain fast convergence and effective disturbance rejection a stand formulation for applying adrc is based on a canonical state space expression of the plant with the total disturbance as an extended state variable the adrc controller order depends on the derivative order of the target variable to be controlled zhou et al 2019 the first order derivation of the plant output y can be formulated by 9 x 1 f b u y x 1 in 9 u is the plant input b is a constant and f represents the total disturbance which combines all the known dynamics and unknown disturbances then f is treated as an extended state variable x 2 to be estimated by the eso the first order adrc controller diagram is illustrated by fig 4 in this figure e is the tracking error b 0 is a roughly estimated value of the constant b of the plant described in 9 and the eso has two outputs z 1 is an estimation of the plant output y and z 2 is the estimated total disturbance f the nonlinear function called fal is applied in the adrc 10 f a l x α δ x α sign x x δ x δ 1 α x δ with x as the main input representing some kind of error information 0 α 1 enables the function value to have a reducing effect with large x input and δ 0 introduces a linear zone to avoid too big function value for small x around 0 the eso of the adrc can then be constructed as 11 ε z 1 y z 1 z 2 b 0 u β 1 f a l ε α 1 δ z 2 β 2 f a l ε α 2 δ with β 1 β 2 as the eso gains the nlc is given as u 0 k 1 f a l e α 0 δ with k 1 as the controller gain the adrc controller output is u u 0 z 2 b 0 it is also possible to move the block 1 b 0 on the z 2 signal channel in fig 4 and thus making the controller output u u 0 z 2 b 0 this could be helpful to reduce the nlc output u 0 and its controller gain k 1 when the constant b 0 is very large 3 2 cascaded adrc control in the proposed cascaded adrc control for the tidal stream turbine generation system fig 2 the current loop adrc controllers are constructed based on the first order derivation of the d q axis currents 12 i d 1 l d r s i d ω e l q i q 1 l d v d i q 1 l q r s i q ω e l d i d ω e ψ m 1 l q v q when comparing 12 with the standard formula 9 it can be seen that for the surface mounted pmsg l d l q l s the constant b 1 l s is the same for the dynamic model of d q axis currents although the total disturbance f has different expressions in d q current loops the same adrc current controller can be used for both current loops for the reason that the total disturbance f does not need to be known or modeled but it can be estimated by the eso in this case only the basic knowledge of b 0 1 l s is required for the adrc current controller applying the adrc approach the q axis current controller is designed as 13 and the d axis current controller can be constructed in the same way 13 ε z 1 i q z 1 z 2 1 l s u β 1 c f a l ε 0 5 2 z 2 β 2 c f a l ε 0 25 2 e i q z 1 u 0 k 1 c f a l e 0 5 2 u u 0 l s z 2 v q in 13 the first three equations are the eso in the adrc current controller to estimate the current by z 1 and the total disturbance of the concerned current loop by z 2 the last three equations describe the nlc and the output of the adrc current controller the eso and nlc gains of the adrc current controller are tuned intuitively by trial and error as β1c 90000 β2c 60000 k 1c 150 for the speed controller the variable to be controlled is the generator rotor speed y ω m and the controller output is the q axis current reference u i q based on the first order derivative of the rotor speed 14 ω m t m j f b ω m j 1 5 n p ψ m j i q the adrc speed controller can be designed as follows 15 ε s z 1 ω m z 1 z 2 b 0 s u β 1 s f a l ε s 0 5 0 01 z 2 β 2 s f a l ε s 0 25 0 01 e s ω m ω m u 0 k 1 s f a l e s 0 3 0 01 u u 0 z 2 b 0 s i q in 15 the constant b 0s is set close to or equal to the constant b 1 5 n p ψ m j as found in 14 it should be noted that the adrc speed controller does not need accurate plant model which means that the unknown disturbances or variations of the mechanical torque friction coefficient rotational speed and the system inertia can be generalized as the total disturbance and estimated inside the eso of the adrc due to the fact that the dynamics of the speed loop is much slower than the current loop and considering a quite important system inertia for the studied 500 kw pmsg based tst system j 4 359 10 4 kg m 2 the eso gains β 1s β 2s should be much smaller than those of the current controller the eso and nlc gains of the adrc speed controller are tuned by simulation as β1s 36 β2s 3 k 1s 20 3 3 second order adrc control there exists a possibility to merge the cascaded speed adrc controller and the q axis adrc controller into 1 s order adrc speed controller if the second order derivation of the rotor speed is formulated as 16 ω m f k t j l q v q f t m j f b ω m j k t j l q r s i q ω e l d i d ω e ψ m d in 16 k t 1 5 n p ψ m is the pmsg torque constant f is the total disturbance to be estimated and rejected by the second order adrc d represents unknown disturbances based on the basic structure of a second order adrc proposed in han 2009 the second order speed controller for the pmsg based tst can be designed as follows 17 ε s z 1 ω m z 1 z 2 β 1 ε s z 2 z 3 b 0 u β 2 f a l ε s 0 9 0 01 z 3 β 3 f a l ε s 0 9 0 01 e 1 ω m ω m e 2 e 1 u 0 k 1 f a l e 1 0 5 0 01 k 2 f a l e 2 1 1 0 01 u u 0 z 3 b 0 v q in 17 the constant b 0 can be set as k t j l s the derivative of the tracking error can be approximately calculated by 18 with τ1 0 001 and τ2 0 0015 to avoid direct differentiation of the tracking error which may contain noises or sharp variations z 1 z 2 and z 3 are the estimations of the rotor speed its derivative and the total disturbance respectively β 1 β 2 and β 3 are the eso gains and k 1 and k 2 are the nlc gains of the second order adrc controller 18 e 2 1 τ 2 τ 1 1 τ 1 s 1 1 τ 2 s 1 e 1 although the second order adrc speed controller enables to generate v q directly from speed tracking error this approach involves a more complicated controller design and large gains have to be used in the eso because the total disturbance needed to be estimated by the second order adrc is greatly increased compared to the first order one 4 simulation and comparative study in this section a 500 kw direct driven pmsg based tst system parameters are listed in the appendix is studied the proposed cascaded adrc approach will be compared with the second order adrc approach the classical pi control approach and the hybrid speed sliding mode plus pi current control strategy these four control strategies are shortened as adrc adrc2 pi and sm in the following comparison study 4 1 control performance evaluation under disturbances of current velocity and torque in this part the current velocity is considered as a constant value of 2 m s during 15s a sudden current velocity fall with 0 7 m s as the peak is applied during 6 6 6s and a large turbine torque thrust of 140knm equivalent to the nominal torque of the pmsg is added at 11 11 5s the speed performance of the adrc approach during the entire 15s will be firstly illustrated and then comparisons with other control methods will be carried out in different time periods fig 5 shows that the rotor speed response under the proposed adrc control strategy converges to the speed reference calculated by mppt very rapidly a rate limiter block is added at the reference speed so that step speed changes can be avoided therefore at the starting stage the speed follows a slop reference during the tidal current disturbance and the turbine mechanical torque disturbance periods the tracking error is about 0 03 rad s and 0 01 rad s which are lower than 1 3 of the steady state speed of 2 377 rad s to compare the adrc performance with other approaches smaller time scales should be used fig 6 compares the rotor speed response during the startup stage it can be observed that the pi approach leads to an overshoot of 0 21 rad s which is 8 8 of the steady state speed the sm approach enables reducing the overshoot to 3 0 08 rad s ardc has fastest convergent speed with a negligible overshoot of 0 13 ardc2 presents no overshoot while it leads some small steady state errors and oscillations than the other approaches fig 7 shows that under the current velocity drop disturbance all the four control approaches are capable to follow a dropping speed reference however when the disturbance is cleared at 6 6s the speed reference has a quick rise to its steady state value in this case pi shows the biggest overshoot and longest settle time among other approaches sm shows a smoother and quicker convergent speed compared with pi while adrc and adrc2 have the fastest convergent speed when the disturbance is cleared although the speed performances of adrc and adrc2 are very similar it should be noted that adrc2 presents small fluctuations which are caused by torque fluctuations due to the reason that adrc2 has no q axis current control loop during the torque disturbance the speed reference is not changed which means that the ideal rotor speed should keep at the steady state value of 2 377 rad s fig 8 illustrates that the sudden rise of the turbine mechanical torque at 11s leads to a speed rising and the clearance of the disturbance at 11 5s causes a speed dropping for pi and sm while sm has less fluctuation and a quick performance recovering than the pi approach both adrc and adrc2 achieve the smallest tracking error and no speed drop error at the clearance of the disturbance at 11 5s during the torque disturbance adrc has a maximum tracking error about 0 007 rad s as also shown in fig 5 adrc2 seems to have even smaller error compared to adrc however speed fluctuations can be seen with adrc2 fig 9 shows that adrc2 leads to bigger torque fluctuations and this explains why speed fluctuations exist in adrc2 this reveals the drawback of adrc2 due to the lack of a q axis current control loop in order to further investigate the control performance speed tracking of the above evaluated strategies two performance indices ise integral of the square error and itae integral of the time weighted absolute error are evaluated they are given by levine 1996 19 i s e t 1 t 2 e 2 t d t 20 i t a e t 1 t 2 t t 1 e t d t in 19 and 20 e t is the speed tracking error t 1 and t 2 represent the time interval of the studied operating stages the ise emphasizes on large overshoot or excessively underdamped behaviors a small ise value usually indicates a good capability of large error suppression the itae emphasizes on both initial response error and persistent errors a low itae can therefore reflect a satisfactory general error suppression performance during the duration of interest itae has been also used to tune pid controller parameters awouda and mamat 2010 or evaluate a controller performance dahiya et al 2017 in our case both ise and itae are calculated for the three specific operating stages starting stage 1s 1 5s current velocity disturbance stage 6s 7 5s and torque disturbance stage 11s 12 5s the achieved performance indices are listed in table 1 based on the calculated performance indices it has been found that for the starting stage adrc has the lowest ise and itae values which demonstrate that it has a best error suppression capability sm has a little higher ise and itae values than pi for the reason that a smooth response may lead to a lower error suppression speed in terms of error integration index this result is coherent with the simulation results shown in fig 6 during current velocity disturbance and torque disturbance stages adrc2 leads to the smallest ise and itae values and adrc has very similar results that are much smaller than those of sm and pi it should be also noted that during the disturbance stages sm could have smaller itae values than pi this means that nonlinear controllers such adrc and sm can have generally better disturbance rejection capabilities than constant parameters pi ones although adrc2 seems slightly better than adrc according to the index values during the disturbances stages it should be pointed out that adrc2 suffers from the lack of a torque loop control q axis current loop and therefore the resulted torque fluctuations are slightly reflected in the speed tracking error due to the system inertia filtering effect these observations show that ise and itae are interesting indices to evaluate a controller tracking performance in this context the speed tracking error suppression capability of the proposed adrc approach is well validated by these performance indices 4 2 control performance evaluation under swell wave disturbances swell waves are identified as the main cause of short time power fluctuations in tst generation systems zhou et al 2013 fig 10 shows the simulated marine current speed under swell effect after 4s fig 11 illustrates the rotor speed response and its tracking error by the proposed cascaded adrc approach it can be observed that the adrc approach realizes a very good speed tracking under swell induced disturbances with negligible tracking errors fig 12 compares the energy production calculated by the integration of generator power under swell disturbance by different control strategies studied in this work at the end of the simulation 60s it can be observed that the energy yielding by pi control is about 2736 wh sm and adrc2 lead to a slightly better energy yielding with 2737 5 wh and adrc leads to a best yielding of 2738 wh 5 adrc under system parameter variations when the generator resistance r s and inductance l s values are changed the current loop tracking performances are mainly concerned figs 13 and 14 show the tracking errors of q axis current under r s variations 20 and 500 and l s variations 50 and 200 large increase of resistance and inductance will cause current pulses while the performances after 0 5s are quite similar compared to the original parameter case this illustrates the robustness of the adrc current controller fig 15 shows the speed responses under different system inertia smaller inertia will increase the speed loop dynamics and make the speed control easier larger system inertia requires higher torque to keep the speed rising rate however the q axis current which directly contributes to the torque is limited by 2 times of nominal current and this explains the increased tracking error at the starting stage in the 200 inertia case adrc works very well to converge the speed to the steady state value rapidly and results in no speed overshoot 6 conclusions in this paper the cascaded adrc approach was proposed to enhance the control performance of a pmsg based tidal stream turbine an alternative namely a second order adrc was also investigated the adrc strategy has clearly shown key features such a lesser dependency on plant model analysis and efficient disturbance rejection capabilities the carried out simulations and the achieved results have clearly illustrated the effectiveness of the proposed adrc strategy under various disturbance conditions while being compared to conventional pi and hybrid sliding mode pi control strategies this work has also shown that the cascaded adrc achieves better performance than the second order adrc in terms of smoothed torque performance indices namely itae and ise have been evaluated for three specific operating conditions the achieved results have clearly confirmed that the proposed adrc approach outperforms the pi and hybrid sliding mode pi control strategies robustness against system parameter variations has also been investigated and verified for the cascaded adrc approach it has been particularly shown that the proposed adrc approach enables slightly improving a tidal stream turbine system energy production during swell wave disturbance

21969,this study aims to propose an optimal horizontal eccentric cylinder type wave energy converter wec prototype suitable for western sea of jeju island by using linear inviscid and nonlinear viscous numerical model appropriately parametric studies with respect to draft and position of center of rotation of horizontal eccentric cylinder type wec were carried out through a frequency domain analysis based on the linear potential theory to propose an optimal design of wec dynamic behaviors of the optimized wec in 1 20 scale induced by regular waves with different wave heights was not only experimentally investigated but also compared with a numerical result with openfoam one of computational fluid dynamic models a response amplitude operator rao induced by a higher wave height is smaller than rao induced by a lower wave height a non linear dynamic behavior is investigated from spectrum analysis a free decay test with different initial pitch excursions shows that nonlinear effects due to viscosity the extracted power of the optimized wec in full scale can be estimated from the simulation of full scale model induced by the wave climate in western sea of jeju island keywords horizontal eccentric cylinder type wec computational fluid dynamic openfoam rao free decay test 1 introduction the development of wave energy converters wecs for harnessing wave energy has been attracting substantial research since the salter s duck was proposed by salter 1974 theoretical analyses swift hook et al 1975 revealed that the radiated waves by pitch motion of the salter duck are closely related to the energy absorbed it is possible to have the primary wave energy conversion with higher efficiency close to 90 because the generated waves by the forced pitch motion of salter s duck whose wave amplitude ratio of the forward side to the leeward side is low the high energy efficiency arises from a cross sectional configuration so called paunch which resembles wave particle velocity profile additionally the changing hydrostatic pressure buoyant fore body near beak contributes to nodding up and down motion however it has a complicated cross sectional shape and is expensive to be manufactured in order to overcome these drawbacks of salter s duck manufacture a circular cylinder with off centered axis of rotation which performs the asymmetric cross sectional motion of salter s duck was investigated cruz and salter 2006 the principle advantage of this design is lower cost of manufacturing process than the original salter duck it is found that the performance is not very different from the original duck lucas et al 2009 in order to design wec that a primary energy conversion is able to be maximized a natural frequency of wec in specific motion mode matches the frequency of a target wave climate as a resonance condition in real sea it is more important to consider a resonant condition because an irregular wave combined with various amplitudes and frequencies has a dense energy at a specific frequency peak frequency energy frequency design parameters with regard to a submerged depth of the cylinder a position of center of rotation cor etc for the optimized performance plays a key role for matching the resonant condition in order to design an optimal wec model parametric studies which require substantial computational efforts have been performed using the linear model in consideration of an efficiency of the numerical calculation however if a viscous effect is not considered an excessive motion occurs near a resonance frequency cruz and salter 2006 wu et al 2017 a linear or nonlinear viscous damping coefficient is determined by performing a free decay test fdt in an experiment and with a computational fluid dynamic cfd model which has been commonly studied in offshore engineering and naval architecture faltinsen 1993 journee and massie 2001 de oliveira and carlos fernandes 2014 the practice for application of viscous damping coefficients is explained for wec studies by wec study asmuth et al 2014 poguluri et al 2019 according to the advance of computer hardware cfd which is fully nonlinear viscous model are widely used in wec performance studies schmitt and elsaesser 2015 vyzikas et al 2017 wu et al 2019 however it requires much computational effort and is not used for broad parametric studies but further nonlinear dynamic behavior study of wec with a few cases the purpose of this study is to propose an optimal horizontal eccentric cylinder type wec prototype suitable for western sea of jeju island south korea by using linear inviscid and nonlinear viscous models appropriately firstly parametric studies with respect to draft and position of cor of horizontal eccentric cylinder type wec were carried out through a frequency domain analysis based on the linear potential flow theory to complement the linear inviscid model a linear viscous damping coefficient calculated from free decay test with openfoam is applied to the parametric studies and then an optimal pto damping and an optimal design of wec is determined for western sea of jeju island south korea dynamic behaviors of the optimized wec in 1 20 scale induced by regular wave with different wave heights was experimentally and numerically analyzed response amplitude operator rao comparisons between different wave heights show that non linear effect and further analysis based on non linear dynamic behavior is investigated from spectrum analysis fdt with different initial pitch excursions shows that nonlinear effect results from nonlinear viscous damping finally the extracted power of the optimized wec in full scale considering the optimal pto damping coefficient from the linear results has been estimated from the simulation of full scale model induced by the wave climate in western sea of jeju island 2 numerical modeling numerical analyses were carried out by a linear inviscid and nonlinear viscous model based on linear potential flow theory and reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations respectively to obtain the optimized wec model numerous parametric studies with respect to draft and cor were conducted using linear potential flow theory because it requires lower computational cost than the nonlinear viscous model once the optimized design is selected numerical simulations with the nonlinear viscous model including fully viscous effect were performed to understand in depth dynamic behavior of the horizontal eccentric cylinder type wec 2 1 linear wave theory

is the surface tension coefficient and the curvature of the free surface respectively in this study the renormalization group rng k ε turbulence model was used for the turbulence flow analysis yakhot et al 1992 in the interfoam solver a vof volume of fluid method was used to track the free surface in two phase air water in the vof method the volume fraction α p computes the phase fraction of the convection but the abrupt boundary change between air and water can be inaccurately expressed due to numerical diffusion versteeg and malalasekera 2007 in openfoam the compression velocity u r is introduced into the volume fraction equation artificially at the interface as in eq 20 20 α p t α p u α p 1 α p u r 0 where u represents the velocity field made up of velocity vectors u v w a cell full of water or of air is represented by 1 and 0 respectively u r max c α u max u is a velocity field perpendicular to the interface for artificial compression and c α can be artificially controlled through openfoam if there is no compression velocity it is set to 0 the higher value means that the compression velocity is applied at the interface is greater than 1 a small value is applied at the compression velocity in comparison with the maximum speed at the interface in order to avoid excessive compressing speed application the volume fraction α p determines the density of the mixed phase fluid in the equation of motion eq 19 by eq 21 21 ρ α p ρ w 1 α p ρ a where ρ w and ρ a are the density of water and air respectively finite volume method fvm is used for discretization in openfoam in

behavior of wec newmark 1959 3 a full scale design of optimal wec for numerical analysis the width and radius of horizontal eccentric cylinder type wecs is 5 m and 2 m respectively the drafts are selected with 1 6 2 4 and 3 2 m for a parametric study the detailed specifications of horizontal eccentric cylinder type wec are summarized in table 1 hydrostatic and hydrodynamic coefficients of horizontal cylinder type wecs in terms of three different drafts are determined with wamit lee and newman 2005 commercial codes but it is cumbersome to calculate numerous cases with different rotational axes in order to reduce the amount of numerical calculation the transformation formulas of force and moment from the horizontal cylinder type wec at coc to the eccentric horizontal cylinder type wec proposed by lucas 2011 is used see table 2 in the table 2 the subscript 11 33 55 corresponds to surge heave and pitch mode of the horizontal cylinder type wec at coc and the superscript means the transformed force and moment at cor the rotational axis moves away from coc as far as possible in manufacture to increase pitch moment the distance of the cor from the coc is l 0 0 75 r which is kept constant a fdt is performed using openfoam which is one of cfd models and then the linear viscous damping coefficient is applied to the inviscid model to predict the pitch excursion numerical analysis was performed at 30deg of initial excursion for the fdt decay coefficient κ 1 2 π l n z 1 z 2 z 3 z 4 is obtained from four successive positive or negative maximum pitch excursions z 1 to z 4 by logarithmic decrement as seen in fig 2 the linear decay coefficient is calculated by changing the position of the cor for each model with different drafts fig 3 shows that the decay coefficient changes with the change of cor also it can be seen that the tendency of the decay coefficient varies with the change of the draft the blue asterisk and the red solid line denote decay coefficients obtained from fdt with openfoam and the fitted curve by the smoothing spline the peak values of the decay coefficient become larger as the draft increases because the larger is the submerged area of wec the greater is the fluid viscous effect as the draft is less than a half of cylinder radius d 1 6 m at 0 to 180 of cor the decay coefficient is different tendency with d 2 4 m and d 3 2 m fig 4 shows pitch rao of the horizontal eccentric cylinder type wec for 1 6 m of depth of submergence without and with linear viscous damping pitch rao with linear viscous damping is dramatically reduced especially near resonant frequency tendency of pitch rao without and with the linear viscous damping is different because fdt results are different among different cors in spite of same draft the maximum pitch rao is at α 270 without the linear viscous damping whereas it is at α 90 with the viscous damping fig 5 shows the optimal pto damping coefficient c o p t p t o of eq 13 which gives the maximum extracted power according to the change of the incident wave frequency ω the depth of submergence d 1 6 m and various rotational axis positions α the optimum pto damping coefficient has a large value in the low frequency region and sharply decreases and then increases again as it goes to the high frequency region with the minimum value at a certain frequency the specific frequency giving the minimum value of the optimal pto damping coefficient corresponds to the natural frequency of the pitch mode of the eccentric horizontal cylinder type wec given in eq 14 in practice it is not easy to change the optimal pto damping coefficient depending on the frequency variation of the irregular wave therefore the pto damping coefficient should be selected to have a constant value regardless of the frequency change of the incident wave taking the minimum value of the pto damping coefficient increases the pitch motion of the eccentric horizontal cylinder type wec which leads to an increase in the extracted power fig 6 a and b show that the averaged extracted power given in eq 22 and natural frequency considering the linear viscous damping of the horizontal eccentric cylinder type wecs with different depth of submergence d 1 6 2 4 3 1 m and positions of cor α 0 to 330 respectively the irregular wave is selected a jonswap spectrum with h s 2 0 m t p 6 65 s e c and γ 1 3 which is measured data in the wave climate in western sea of jeju island south korea the maximum extracted power irrespective of the depth of submergence appears 7 3 kw especially at the lowest depth of submergence and α 300 interesting results are that as most of cors placed above the water surface the extracted power is larger than under the water surface in addition the extracted power with d 1 6 m and α 270 is suddenly dropped while the pitch rao is almost similar to α 300 in fig 4 this is because the natural frequency of α 270 is lower than the irregular wave peak frequency that denotes the red solid line as shown in the fig 6 b in general the energy density of jonswap spectrum at lower frequency is higher than at higher frequency 4 1 20 model scale of optimal wec 4 1 experimental set up a scale down model of the optimal horizontal eccentric cylinder type wec was designed and fabricated with 1 20 scale by froude s similarity fig 7 shows the geometry of a two dimensional wave tank length 20 m width 0 8 m height 1 0 m of the jeju national university along with the eccentric circular cylinder wave is generated by a piston type wave maker in front of wave flume and the wave is absorbed by two layered perforated stainless steels inclined at the end of the wave flume the optimal horizontal eccentric cylinder type wec with 0 1 m of radius and 0 708 m of width is deployed at 10 0 m from the wave maker as shown in the fig 7 a shaft and a bearing at cor position α 300 l 0 75 r were used to allow only single degree of freedom pitch motion as illustrated in fig 8 a video tracking method was used to measure the pitch displacement for a fdt due to regular incident waves table 3 shows the specification of the optimal horizontal eccentric cylinder type wec 1 20 model scaled linear regular waves with various wave period range 1 1 7 s and wave heights 0 01 m and 0 04 m are selected as incident wave conditions 4 2 cfd analysis a schematic diagram of the numerical wave flume and the position of the horizontal eccentric cylinder type wec is shown in fig 9 waves2foam jacobsen et al 2012 is used for wave generation and absorption and it includes a relaxation zone on both sides of the numerical wave flume for controlling wave and reflected wave by eq 24 24 φ α r φ computed 1 α r φ target where φ represents velocity u or volume fraction α p and φ c o m p u t e d and φ t a r g e t are the calculated solutions and theoretical solution respectively α r is a weight factor is calculated by eq 25 25 α r χ r 1 exp χ r 3 5 1 exp 1 1 for χ r 0 1 where χ r is the local coordinate system in which the length of the relaxation interval is a value between 0 and 1 α r always has a value of 1 at the boundary between the relaxation interval and the calculated region in order to generate the target wave and it is always 0 at the end of the tank to control the reflected wave the length of the wave generation and absorption is set to be 1 5 times longer than the longest wave length of incident wave conditions and the distance from the relaxation section to the wave generator is 1 5 times longer than the longest wave period respectively the pressureinletoutletvelocity and totalpressure boundary condition is applied on the top of wave flume for lid off velocity and pressure respectively no slip and zerogradient boundary conditions are applied on the bottom wall for the velocity and the phase fraction respectively a grid convergence test was carried out for accuracy and efficiency of wave generation and propagation the time series of water surface elevation at middle of wave flume where wec is deployed and the spatial distribution of water surface elevation at 20sec with different coarser medium and finer grid resolutions are compared with an analytical solution as shown in fig 10 10 wave cycles comparison between the theoretical solution and numerical solutions by root mean square difference rmsd method are summarized in table 4 the higher grid resolution is the lower the rms considering the efficiency and accuracy of the computational calculation the medium grid resolution is selected the following numerical analysis in this study a grid convergence test for dynamic grid analysis was conducted as shown in fig 11 for one case of fdts background grid is constant while coarser medium and finer grid resolution of inner ami region are changed 4 peak pitch heights and 4 periods in the fdt α 59 with numerical simulation are compared with the experimental results and summarized in table 5 as the grid resolution become higher the rmsds of pitch and period are not always low in the present study the medium grid resolution was chosen for inner ami region in consideration of the rmsds of period and pitch as shown in fig 12 the grid resolution was determined higher around the asymmetric wec and near the free water surface based on the grid convergence test to simulate a large rotational motion of the horizontal cylinder type wec without a mesh distortion ami arbitrary mesh interface was selected as seen in white cylinder around the wec the ami consists of a fixed cylindrical outer interface and a rotatable inner interface and all the calculated results are interpolated through the ami 5 non linear hydrodynamic behavior raos in pitch mode were compared with numerical results of wamit with and without a linear viscous damping and openfoam and experimental data as shown in fig 13 2048 panels are selected from the panel convergence test the linear viscous damping coefficient obtained from the experimental fdt at initial angle of 30deg is applied to the numerical result of wamit to investigate a nonlinear dynamic behavior due to different wave heights raos induced by 0 01 m and 0 04 m of wave heights were obtained from the openfoam and the experimental data the highest wave height is selected as 0 04 m to reduce nonlinearity of wave because wave steepness k a is less than 0 08 the raos with openfoam are over predicted where period is longer than and equal to the natural period because of experimental uncertainties which come from the reflected wave against wave maker and a mechanical damping effect via bearing system however the rao tendencies of the cylinder type wec induced by different incident wave heights with openfoam are in good agreement with the experimental data raos are affected by different wave heights through comparison between openfoam and experimental results the higher is incident wave height the lower is rao it means that wave energy in its own frequency is not properly converted to the cylinder type wec with the frequency as the wave height is higher it will be explained by the following spectral analysis fig 14 a f show comparisons of the time series of pitch excursion by openfoam and experimental data taken during three wave cycles the numerical results are in very good agreement with the experimental results as the incident wave height is increased the pitch excursion is also increased as the wave height increases the clockwise positive pitch excursion is higher than the counter clockwise negative pitch excursions fig 15 a f show comparisons of the spectrum analysis of pitch excursion by openfoam and experimental data although the wave nonlinearity is almost negligible the second harmonic motion appeared experimentally and numerically even induced by h 0 01 m and t 1 35 s is similar to the resonant frequency of horizontal eccentric cylinder type wec as wave height increases not only the primary pitch motions are increased but also the second harmonic pitch motion increases in addition third harmonic motions are appeared in the highest pitch excursion induced by h 0 04 m and t 1 35 s and t 1 70 s the enhanced nonlinear effect is associated with the rao decrease with higher wave height as shown in the fig 13 the primary second and third harmonic motion extracted from the spectrum analysis in the fig 15 are summarized in table 6 for a quantitative analysis as the wave height increases by 4 times the change of primary harmonic motion shows about 3 3 times increased at the incident wave periods 1 00 and 1 70 s which are away from the resonant period whereas it is 2 4 times increase at the resonant period of the horizontal eccentric cylinder type wec the second harmonic motion increases and the third harmonic motion appears as the wave height increases as a result it is envisaged that the rao in the fig 13 decreases with increasing wave height due to the presence of primary harmonic motion 6 non linear damping effects considering that viscous effect is predominant for the nonlinear dynamic behavior of horizontal eccentric cylinder type wec α 300 as shown in the experimental and openfoam results of the section 5 fdt were performed at different initial pitch angle experimentally and numerically fig 16 a and b show comparisons of the pitch excursion fdt by openfoam and experimental data at initial angles of 20 and 50 the openfoam results predict well the experimental results the numerical fdt results with openfoam are compared to the experimental results and the decay coefficient κ and the averaged fdt period t z t z 1 t z 2 2 were also investigated according to the change of initial pitch angle as shown in figs 17 and 18 respectively the experimental results show that the small initial angle is slightly different from the numerical analysis due to mechanical damping however as the initial angle is increased the averaged fdt period t z as well as the decay coefficient κ are also increased as the initial angle is small the averaged fdt period t z is similar to the natural period t n 1 3 s e c predicted by wamit however as the initial angle increases the averaged fdt period t z is further increased than the wamit result the more viscous the fluid is the more the damping moment affects the natural period in other words it relates the increase of decay coefficient κ which decides the linear damping coefficient by the increase of initial angle therefore the nonlinearity of damping coefficient due to the viscosity of fluid is considered to be an important cause of nonlinear dynamic behavior of horizontal eccentric cylinder type wec α 300 7 full scale of optimal wec the extracted power of full scale of optimal horizontal eccentric cylinder type wec α 300 was calculated induced by the irregular wave in western sea of jeju island the incident wave was generated by adding an additional term to the jonswap spectrum of wave2foam to use the jonswap spectrum under the same conditions as the frequency domain analysis the irregular wave based on the jonswap spectrum with h s 2 0 m t p 6 65 s e c and γ 1 3 is produced by a linear superposition of first order stokes waves the phases are randomly created between 0 r a d and 2 π r a d and the spectrum is discretized by 200 wave components with non equidistant frequency including a cut off frequency of 0 3 t p and 3 t p respectively in order to verify the generated waves the spectrum results obtained from the time series of free surface elevation in the simulation time of 900 s at the middle of the wave tank are compared to the target spectrum as shown in fig 19 the comparison shows that the incident wave generated in the numerical analysis is in good agreement with the target incident wave to obtain the extracted power the optimal pto damping coefficient obtained from the linear model is applied to the openfoam simulation as shown in fig 20 the time averaged extraction power was obtained at 7 8 kw similar to the linear model result however it is important to say that a nonlinear model results gives a similar linear model result 8 conclusions in order to obtain more reliable rao especially near resonant frequency linear viscous damping coefficients were obtained using openfoam which is a nonlinear viscous model and applied to the inviscid linear model parametric studies using the linear model with the linear damping coefficient were carried out according to the change of draft and cor of horizontal eccentric cylinder type wec the optimal pto damping coefficient is calculated and then the horizontal eccentric cylinder type wec prototype considering the optimal pto damping coefficient which has the highest extracted power in western sea of jeju island is proposed dynamic behavior analysis of the optimal horizontal eccentric cylinder type wec with 1 20 scale model induced by regular waves were performed numerically and experimentally the numerical results with openfoam predict rao well according to different wave heights in comparison to experiments as the wave height increases the nonlinearity increases with the dynamic behavior near the resonance period a fdt was performed to investigate the viscous damping effect according to the initial pitch angles as the initial pitch angles were increased greater submergence both the viscous damping effect of the wec and the averaged fdt period t z is increased this suggests that the viscous effect is one of the causes of the nonlinear dynamic behavior according to increase of wave height by applying the optimal pto damping coefficients obtained from the linear model results to the full scale model the time averaged extracted power induced by jonswap spectrum with h 1 3 2 m and t p 6 65 s e c in the western sea of jeju island was obtained it is possible that the optimal horizontal eccentric cylinder type wec on the western sea of jeju island could be proposed and the extracted power could be estimated with

21969,this study aims to propose an optimal horizontal eccentric cylinder type wave energy converter wec prototype suitable for western sea of jeju island by using linear inviscid and nonlinear viscous numerical model appropriately parametric studies with respect to draft and position of center of rotation of horizontal eccentric cylinder type wec were carried out through a frequency domain

keywords horizontal eccentric cylinder type wec computational fluid dynamic openfoam rao free decay test 1 introduction the development of wave energy converters wecs for harnessing wave energy has been attracting substantial research since the salter s duck was proposed by salter 1974 theoretical analyses swift hook et al 1975 revealed that the radiated waves by pitch motion of the salter duck are closely related to the energy absorbed it is possible to have the primary wave energy conversion with higher efficiency close to 90 because the generated waves by the forced pitch motion of salter s duck whose wave amplitude ratio of the forward side to the leeward side is low the high energy efficiency arises from a cross sectional configuration so called paunch which resembles wave particle velocity profile additionally the changing hydrostatic pressure buoyant fore body near beak contributes to nodding up and down motion however it has a complicated cross sectional shape and is expensive to be manufactured in order to overcome these drawbacks of salter s duck manufacture a circular cylinder with off centered axis of rotation which performs the asymmetric cross sectional motion of salter s duck was investigated cruz and salter 2006 the principle advantage of this design is lower cost of manufacturing process than the original salter duck it is found that the performance is not very different from the original duck lucas et al 2009 in order to design wec that a primary energy conversion is able to be maximized a natural frequency of wec in specific motion mode matches the frequency of a target wave climate as a resonance condition in real sea it is more important to consider a resonant condition because an irregular wave combined with various amplitudes and frequencies has a dense energy at a specific frequency peak frequency energy frequency design parameters with regard to a submerged depth of the cylinder a position of center of rotation cor etc for the optimized performance plays a key role for matching the resonant condition in order to design an optimal wec model parametric studies which require substantial computational efforts have been performed using the linear model in consideration of an efficiency of the numerical calculation however if a viscous effect is not considered an excessive motion occurs near a resonance frequency cruz and salter 2006 wu et al 2017 a linear or nonlinear viscous damping coefficient is determined by performing a free decay test fdt in an experiment and with a computational fluid dynamic cfd model which has been commonly studied in offshore engineering and naval architecture faltinsen 1993 journee and massie 2001 de oliveira and carlos fernandes 2014 the practice for application of viscous damping coefficients is explained for wec studies by wec study asmuth et al 2014 poguluri et al 2019 according to the advance of computer hardware cfd which is fully nonlinear viscous model are widely used in wec performance studies schmitt and elsaesser 2015 vyzikas et al 2017 wu et al 2019 however it requires much computational effort and is not used for broad parametric studies but further nonlinear dynamic behavior study of wec with a few cases the purpose of this study is to propose an optimal horizontal eccentric cylinder type wec prototype suitable for western sea of jeju island south korea by using linear inviscid and nonlinear viscous models appropriately firstly parametric studies with respect to draft and position of cor of horizontal eccentric cylinder type wec were carried out through a frequency domain analysis based on the linear potential flow theory to complement the linear inviscid model a linear viscous damping coefficient calculated from free decay test with openfoam is applied to the parametric studies and then an optimal pto damping and an optimal design of wec is determined for western sea of jeju island south korea dynamic behaviors of the optimized wec in 1 20 scale induced by regular wave with different wave heights was experimentally and numerically analyzed response amplitude operator rao comparisons between different wave heights show that non linear effect and further analysis based on non linear dynamic behavior is investigated from spectrum analysis fdt with different initial pitch excursions shows that nonlinear effect results from nonlinear viscous damping finally the extracted power of the optimized wec in full scale considering the optimal pto damping coefficient from the linear results has been estimated from the simulation of full scale model induced by the wave climate in western sea of jeju island 2 numerical modeling numerical analyses were carried out by a linear inviscid and nonlinear viscous model based on linear potential flow theory and reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations respectively to obtain the optimized wec model numerous parametric studies with respect to draft and cor were conducted using linear potential flow theory because it requires lower computational cost than the nonlinear viscous model once the optimized design is selected numerical simulations with the nonlinear viscous model including fully viscous effect were performed to understand in depth dynamic behavior of the horizontal eccentric cylinder type wec 2 1 linear wave theory modeling frequency domain analysis a horizontal eccentric cylinder type wec with a draft d rotates in the beam sea where an incident wave has amplitude a and frequency ω progresses toward the positive direction of x axis is illustrated in fig 1 the origin of the coordinate axis is located at the center of water plane area of cylinder and z axis is held vertically upward the cor is defined with a distance l 0 from the center of the cylinder coc and an angle α counter clockwise in the positive direction the rao of single degree of freedom for pitch motion by restricting the horizontal and

the position vector μ eff is the effective dynamic viscosity calculated as the sum of the dynamic viscosity μ and the turbulent dynamic viscosity μ t and ρ u u denotes the reynolds stresses σ and κ c is the surface tension coefficient and the curvature of the free surface respectively in this study the renormalization group rng k ε turbulence model was used for the turbulence flow analysis yakhot et al 1992 in the interfoam solver a vof volume of fluid method was used to track the free surface in two phase air water in the vof method the volume fraction α p computes the phase fraction of the convection but the abrupt boundary change between air and water can be inaccurately expressed due to numerical diffusion versteeg and malalasekera 2007 in openfoam the compression velocity u r is introduced into the volume fraction equation artificially at the interface as in eq 20 20 α p t α p u α p 1 α p u r 0 where u represents the velocity field made up of velocity vectors u v w a cell full of water or of air is represented by 1 and 0 respectively u r max c α u max u is a velocity field perpendicular to the interface for artificial compression and c α can be artificially controlled through openfoam if there is no compression velocity it is set to 0 the higher value means that the compression velocity is applied at the interface is greater than 1 a small value is applied at the compression velocity in comparison with the maximum speed at the interface in order to avoid excessive compressing speed application the volume fraction α p determines the density of the mixed phase fluid in the equation of motion eq 19 by eq 21 21 ρ α p ρ w 1 α p ρ a where ρ w and ρ a are the density of water and air respectively finite volume method fvm is used for discretization in openfoam in the equations of motion the convection term was applied to normalized variable diminishing nvd limited linear method and the volume fraction was calculated by gauss vanleer van leer 1979 difference method the calculation by the pressure velocity coupling is performed by the pimple algorithm which combines pressure implicit with splitting of operator piso and semi implicit method for pressure linked equations simple piso and simple algorithms are described in detail in issa 1986 ferziger and peric 1999 2 2 2 motion equation of horizontal eccentric cylinder type wec the motion equations of the horizontal eccentric cylinder type wec is obtained using a force and moment by the fluid flow pressures solved by eqs 18 and 19 22 f t s f e x t f f l o w d s m x 23 m t s m e x t m f l o w d s j

or viscosity m and j is a mass and a moment of inertia of the wec x and θ are a translational and rotational motions respectively the newmark time integration method was chosen to calculate dynamic behavior of wec newmark 1959 3 a full scale design of optimal wec for numerical analysis the width and radius of horizontal eccentric cylinder type wecs is 5 m and 2 m respectively the drafts are selected with 1 6 2 4 and 3 2 m for a parametric study the detailed specifications of horizontal eccentric cylinder type wec are summarized in table 1 hydrostatic and hydrodynamic coefficients of horizontal cylinder type wecs in terms of three different drafts are determined with wamit lee and newman 2005 commercial codes but it is cumbersome to calculate numerous cases with different rotational axes in order to reduce the amount of numerical calculation the transformation formulas of force and moment from the horizontal cylinder type wec at coc to the eccentric horizontal cylinder type wec proposed by lucas 2011 is used see table 2 in the table 2 the subscript 11 33 55 corresponds to surge heave and pitch mode of the horizontal cylinder type wec at coc and the superscript means the transformed force and moment at cor the rotational axis moves away from coc as far as possible in manufacture to increase pitch moment the distance of the cor from the coc is l 0 0 75 r which is kept constant a fdt is performed using openfoam which is one of cfd models and then the linear viscous damping coefficient is applied to the inviscid model to predict the pitch excursion numerical analysis was performed at 30deg of initial excursion for the fdt decay coefficient κ 1 2 π l n z 1 z 2 z 3 z 4 is obtained from four successive positive or negative maximum pitch excursions z 1 to z 4 by logarithmic decrement as seen in fig 2 the linear decay coefficient is calculated by changing the position of the cor for each model with different drafts fig 3 shows that the decay coefficient changes with the change of cor also it can be seen that the tendency of the decay coefficient varies with the change of the draft the blue asterisk and the red solid line denote decay coefficients obtained from fdt with openfoam and the fitted curve by the smoothing spline the peak values of the decay coefficient become larger as the draft increases because the larger is the submerged area of wec the greater is the fluid viscous effect as the draft is less than a half of cylinder radius d 1 6 m at 0 to 180 of cor the decay coefficient is different tendency with d 2 4 m and d 3 2 m fig 4 shows pitch rao of the horizontal eccentric cylinder type wec for 1 6 m of depth of submergence without and with linear viscous damping pitch rao with linear viscous damping is dramatically reduced especially near resonant frequency tendency of pitch rao without and with the linear viscous damping is different because fdt results are different among different cors in spite of same draft the maximum pitch rao is at α 270 without the linear viscous damping whereas it is at α 90 with the viscous damping fig 5 shows the optimal pto damping coefficient c o p t p t o of eq 13 which gives the maximum extracted power according to the change of the incident wave frequency ω the depth of submergence d 1 6 m and various rotational axis positions α the optimum pto damping coefficient has a large value in the low frequency region and sharply decreases and then increases again as it goes to the high frequency region with the minimum value at a certain frequency the specific frequency giving the minimum value of the optimal pto damping coefficient corresponds to the natural frequency of the pitch mode of the eccentric horizontal cylinder type wec given in eq 14 in practice it is not easy to change the optimal pto damping coefficient depending on the frequency variation of the irregular wave therefore the pto damping coefficient should be selected to have a constant value regardless of the frequency change of the incident wave taking the minimum value of the pto damping coefficient increases the pitch motion of the eccentric horizontal cylinder type wec which leads to an increase in the extracted power fig 6 a and b show that the averaged extracted power given in eq 22 and natural frequency considering the linear viscous damping of the horizontal eccentric cylinder type wecs with different depth of submergence d 1 6 2 4 3 1 m and positions of cor α 0 to 330 respectively the irregular wave is selected a jonswap spectrum with h s 2 0 m t p 6 65 s e c and γ 1 3 which is measured data in the wave climate in western sea of jeju island south korea the maximum extracted power irrespective of the depth of submergence appears 7 3 kw especially at the lowest depth of submergence and α 300 interesting results are that as most of cors placed above the water surface the extracted power is larger than under the water surface in addition the extracted power with d 1 6 m and α 270 is suddenly dropped while the pitch rao is almost similar to α 300 in fig 4 this is because the natural frequency of α 270 is lower than the irregular wave peak frequency that denotes the red solid line as shown in the fig 6 b in general the energy density of jonswap spectrum at lower frequency is higher than at higher frequency 4 1 20 model scale of optimal wec 4 1 experimental

10 0 m from the wave maker as shown in the fig 7 a shaft and a bearing at cor position α 300 l 0 75 r were used to allow only single degree of freedom pitch motion as illustrated in fig 8 a video tracking method was used to measure the pitch displacement for a fdt due to regular incident waves table 3 shows the specification of the optimal horizontal eccentric cylinder type wec 1 20 model scaled linear regular waves with various wave period range 1 1 7 s and wave heights 0 01 m and 0 04 m are selected as incident wave conditions 4 2 cfd analysis a schematic diagram of the numerical wave flume and the position of the horizontal eccentric cylinder type wec is shown in fig 9 waves2foam jacobsen et al 2012 is used for wave generation and absorption and it includes a relaxation zone on both sides of the numerical wave flume for controlling wave and reflected wave by eq 24 24 φ α r φ computed 1 α r φ target where φ represents velocity u or volume fraction α p and φ c o m p u t e d and φ t a r g e t are the calculated solutions and theoretical solution respectively α r is a weight factor is calculated by eq 25 25 α r χ r 1 exp χ r 3 5 1 exp 1 1 for χ r 0 1 where χ r is the local coordinate system in which the length of the relaxation interval is a value between 0 and 1 α r always has a value of 1 at the boundary between the relaxation interval and the calculated region in order to generate the target wave and it is always 0 at the end of the tank to control the reflected wave the length of the wave generation and absorption is set to be 1 5 times longer than the longest wave length of incident wave conditions and the distance from the relaxation section to the wave generator is 1 5 times longer than the longest wave period respectively the pressureinletoutletvelocity and totalpressure boundary condition is applied on the top of wave flume for lid off velocity and pressure respectively no slip and zerogradient boundary conditions are applied on the bottom wall for the velocity and the phase fraction respectively a grid convergence test was carried out for accuracy and efficiency of wave generation and propagation the time series of water surface elevation at middle of wave flume where wec is deployed and the spatial distribution of water surface elevation at 20sec with different coarser medium and finer grid resolutions are compared with an analytical solution as shown in fig 10 10 wave cycles comparison between the theoretical solution and numerical solutions by root mean square difference rmsd method are summarized in table 4 the higher grid resolution is the lower the rms considering the efficiency and accuracy of the computational calculation the medium grid resolution is selected the following numerical analysis in this study a grid convergence test for dynamic grid analysis was conducted as shown in fig 11 for one case of fdts background grid is constant while coarser medium and finer grid resolution of inner ami region are changed 4 peak pitch heights and 4 periods in the fdt α 59 with numerical simulation are compared with the experimental results and summarized in table 5 as the grid resolution become higher the rmsds of pitch and period are not always low in the present study the medium grid resolution was chosen for inner ami region in consideration of the rmsds of period and pitch as shown in fig 12 the grid resolution was determined higher around the asymmetric wec and near the free water surface based on the grid convergence test to simulate a large rotational motion of the horizontal cylinder type wec without a mesh distortion ami arbitrary mesh interface was selected as seen in white cylinder around the wec the ami consists of a fixed cylindrical outer interface and a rotatable inner interface and all the calculated results are interpolated through the ami 5 non linear hydrodynamic behavior raos in pitch mode were compared with numerical results of wamit with and without a linear viscous damping and openfoam and experimental data as shown in fig 13 2048 panels are selected from the panel convergence test the linear viscous damping coefficient obtained from the experimental fdt at initial angle of 30deg is applied to the numerical result of wamit to investigate a nonlinear dynamic behavior due to different wave heights raos induced by 0 01 m and 0 04 m of wave heights were obtained from the openfoam and the experimental data the highest wave height is selected as 0 04 m to reduce nonlinearity of wave because wave steepness k a is less than 0 08 the raos with openfoam are over predicted where period is longer than and equal to the natural period because of experimental uncertainties which come from the reflected wave against wave maker and a mechanical damping effect via bearing system however the rao tendencies of the cylinder type wec induced by different incident wave heights with openfoam are in good agreement with the experimental data raos are affected by different wave heights through comparison between openfoam and experimental results the higher is incident wave height the lower is rao it means that wave energy in its own frequency is not properly converted to the cylinder type wec with the frequency as the wave height is higher it will be explained by the following spectral analysis fig 14 a f show comparisons of the time series of pitch excursion by openfoam and experimental data taken during three wave cycles the numerical results are in very good agreement with the experimental results as the incident wave height is increased the pitch excursion is also increased as the wave height increases the clockwise positive pitch excursion is higher than the counter clockwise negative pitch excursions fig 15 a f show comparisons of the spectrum analysis of pitch excursion by openfoam and experimental data although the wave nonlinearity is almost negligible the second harmonic motion appeared experimentally and numerically even induced by h 0 01 m and t 1 35 s is similar to the resonant frequency of horizontal eccentric cylinder type wec as wave height increases not only the primary pitch motions are increased but also the second harmonic pitch motion increases in addition third harmonic motions are appeared in the highest pitch excursion induced by h 0 04 m and t 1 35 s and t 1 70 s the enhanced nonlinear effect is associated with the rao decrease with higher wave height as shown in the fig 13 the primary second and third harmonic motion extracted from the spectrum analysis in the fig 15 are summarized in table 6 for a quantitative analysis as the wave height increases by 4 times the change of primary harmonic motion shows about 3 3 times increased at the incident wave periods 1 00 and 1 70 s which are away from the resonant period whereas it is 2 4 times increase at the resonant period of the horizontal eccentric cylinder type wec the second harmonic motion increases and the third harmonic motion appears as the wave height increases as a result it is envisaged that the rao in the fig 13 decreases with increasing wave height due to the presence of primary harmonic motion 6 non linear damping effects considering that viscous effect is predominant for the nonlinear dynamic behavior of horizontal eccentric cylinder type wec α 300 as shown in the experimental and openfoam results of the section 5 fdt were performed at different initial pitch angle experimentally and numerically fig 16 a and b show comparisons of the pitch excursion fdt by openfoam and experimental data at initial angles of 20 and 50 the openfoam results predict well the experimental results the numerical fdt results with openfoam are compared to the experimental results and the decay coefficient κ and the averaged fdt period t z t z 1 t z 2 2 were also investigated according to the change of initial pitch angle as shown in figs 17 and 18 respectively the experimental results show that the small initial angle is slightly different from the numerical analysis due to mechanical damping however as the initial angle is increased the averaged fdt period t z as well as the decay coefficient κ are also increased as the initial angle is small the averaged fdt period t z is similar to the natural period t n 1 3 s e c predicted by wamit however as the initial angle increases the averaged fdt period t z is further increased than the wamit result the more viscous the fluid is the more the damping moment affects the natural period in other words it relates the increase of decay coefficient κ which decides the linear damping coefficient by the increase of initial angle therefore the nonlinearity of damping coefficient due to the viscosity of fluid is considered to be an important cause of nonlinear dynamic behavior of horizontal eccentric cylinder type wec α 300 7 full scale of optimal wec the extracted power of full scale of optimal horizontal eccentric cylinder type wec α 300 was calculated induced by the irregular wave in western sea of jeju island the incident wave was generated by adding an additional term to the jonswap spectrum of wave2foam to use the jonswap spectrum under the same conditions as the frequency domain analysis the irregular wave based on the jonswap spectrum with h s 2 0 m t p 6 65 s e c and γ 1 3 is produced by a linear superposition of first order stokes waves the phases are randomly created between 0 r a d and 2 π r a d and the spectrum is discretized by 200 wave components with non equidistant frequency including a cut off frequency of 0 3 t p and 3 t p respectively in order to verify the generated waves the spectrum results obtained from the time series of free surface elevation in the simulation time of 900 s at the middle of the wave tank are compared to the target spectrum as shown in fig 19 the comparison shows that the incident wave generated in the numerical analysis is in good agreement with the target incident wave to obtain the extracted power the optimal pto damping coefficient obtained from the linear model is applied to the openfoam simulation as shown in fig 20 the time averaged extraction power was obtained at 7 8 kw similar to the linear model result however it is important to say that a nonlinear model results gives a similar linear model result 8 conclusions in order to obtain more reliable rao especially near resonant frequency linear viscous damping coefficients were obtained using openfoam which is a nonlinear viscous model and applied to the inviscid linear model parametric studies using the linear model with the linear damping coefficient were carried out according to the change of draft and cor of horizontal eccentric cylinder type wec the optimal pto damping coefficient is calculated and then the horizontal eccentric cylinder type wec prototype considering the optimal pto damping coefficient which has the highest extracted power in western sea of jeju island is proposed dynamic behavior analysis of the optimal horizontal eccentric cylinder type wec with 1 20 scale model induced by regular waves were performed numerically and experimentally the numerical results with openfoam predict rao well according to different wave heights in comparison to experiments as the wave height increases the nonlinearity increases with the dynamic behavior near the resonance period a fdt was performed to investigate the viscous damping effect according to the initial pitch angles as the initial pitch angles were increased greater submergence both the viscous damping effect of the wec and the averaged fdt period t z is increased this suggests that the viscous effect is one of the causes of the nonlinear dynamic behavior according to increase of wave height by applying the optimal pto damping coefficients obtained from the linear model results to the full scale model the time averaged extracted power induced by jonswap spectrum with h 1 3 2 m and t p 6 65 s e c in the western sea of jeju island was obtained it is possible that the optimal horizontal eccentric cylinder type wec on the western sea of jeju island could be proposed and the extracted power could be estimated with maximizing computational efficiency using the appropriate utilization of the linear inviscid and nonlinear viscous model credit authorship contribution statement haeng sik ko methodology validation
