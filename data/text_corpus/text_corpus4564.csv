22820,prediction of the extremal responses of dynamic structures is a vital step in the risk management of offshore assets often when modelling structural response the outputs are dependent on covariates defined on a continuous input domain we demonstrate a methodology to allow for continuous covariates in extremal modelling by building latent variable models whereby output dependencies are incorporated by smooth processes in the latent parameters this allows information from close by input regions to be shared when forming inference at unseen inputs we illustrate the methodology using a computational simulation of floating production storage and offloading fpso vessel motions modelled as functions of the peak wave period we provide methodologies and diagnostics for the modelling of the time domain maxima quantiles and threshold exceedance data there are three contributions made by this research a methodology to predict the extremal outputs from a time domain simulator with incorporation of continuous covariate knowledge significant speed increase when using the developed methodology as a computational proxy to the simulator and a framework for the probabilistic quantification of the output uncertainty of the extremal data keywords extremal data latent variable model uncertainty quantification dynamic structures fpso vessel motions bayesian statistics 1 introduction existing frameworks for the analysis of extremal data in offshore engineering primarily focus on the prediction of extreme environmental conditions e g jonathan and ewans 2013 in parallel there is a growing need for methodologies to predict and quantify uncertainty surrounding extremal structural motions for operational risk management and decision making operational strategies frequently rely upon simulated structural dynamics that are the outputs of complex functions the inputs of which are metocean parameters bitner gregersen 2015 although technological advances have meant near real time predictive tools are increasingly desired in industrial settings khan et al 2016 this can be infeasible with some simulators astfalck et al 2018b describe how a statistical surrogate of a simulator a k a an emulator can execute evaluations 60 000 times faster than a simulator of mean turret offset and produce reliable predictions this article extends the work of astfalck et al 2018b to a methodology that emulates extremal features of outputs from a simulator that requires only the parsimonious usage of training data to provide fast and accurate predictive performance we model the extremal realisations from the time domain computer simulation of a turret moored floating production storage and offloading fpso vessel with inputs specified by the environmental forcing to align with industry standards dnv 2014 3 h time domain simulations of the vessel motions are used the vessel of interest is currently mooring in the australian north west shelf one of australia s most economically significant maritime regions the australian north west shelf is subject to metocean conditions with high spatio temporal variation due to phenomena such as frequent internal waves strong and sporadic eddies tropical cyclones and perennial swell astfalck et al 2018a it is vital to the safety of the vessel to predict when metocean conditions are expected to lead to unfavourable local motions as work may become unsafe and subsequently halted until the vessel stabilises the decision to halt work is costly and must be balanced with the risk of injury and asset damage mcbride 2012 over caution leads to superfluous economic loss conversely under caution may lead to economic social and environmental consequences this research is motivated by the need to predict the distributions of vessel extreme behaviours in a timely and accurate manner statistical extreme value ev theory provides a mathematical framework in which to quantify the extremal behaviour of measured quantities coles et al 2001 asymptotic arguments allow for the distributions of maxima and threshold exceedance data to be quantified without the need to model the main body of the data de haan and ferreira 2007 modelling the maxima is immediately possible from the time series data however modelling the threshold exceedance evaluations relies on the specification of a threshold it is seldom clear what value this threshold should take as it is required to be high enough for the asymptotic arguments to hold but low enough to leverage sufficient data ross et al 2017 alternatively thresholds may be specified by domain experts to provide values that are meaningful for operations in the absence of such criteria we use quantile regression to set a threshold to correspond to a high covariate dependent quantile of the time series data quantile regression is used to estimate the quantile values providing a meaningful threshold in the modelling of the threshold exceedance data this modelling process yields predictions for three extremal quantities maxima threshold exceedance motions and quantiles the simulator s maxima and threshold exceedance outputs are assumed to either be realisations of generalised extreme value gev or generalised pareto genp distributions the paramaters of which are functions of the input space simulator output dependencies are induced by modelling the gev and genp parameters as smooth functions over the input space we implement the latent variable model in a bayesian framework this allows for the inclusion of prior beliefs and the use of markov chain monte carlo mcmc sampling to numerically integrate over the analytically intractable latent space metropolis et al 1953 hastings 1970 three motions key to vessel operability are analysed as a function of the peak wave period heave pitch and roll to assess model performance two diagnostics are introduced we utilise coverage plots and quantile quantile qq density plots to examine the models of maxima and threshold exceedance over the entire predictive distribution for the quantiles the resulting fit from minimising leave one out cross validation over both the training and validation data is used as a measure of truth and the quantile regression results are compared to this fit using the root mean squared error the demonstrated methodologies provide a good basis for the fast and accurate modelling of extremal data over a continuous input space due to the specification of covariance between inputs relatively small numbers of simulations are required by the modelling the scope of the research has been developed in conjunction with industry and future avenues for deployment are being investigated the paper proceeds as follows section 2 reviews the simulator of vessel motions and presents the maxima data section 3 defines the three analysed tail behaviours section 4 describes the background statistical knowledge section 5 specifies the latent variable models section 6 presents the results with diagnostics section 7 provides discussion and outlines future avenues of development and section 8 offers conclusions from the research code used in the research is available on the first author s github repository https github com astfalckl extreme as the analysed data are confidential a synthetic dataset has been generated and uploaded to be used with the developed code 2 simulator of fpso vessel motions the dynamic responses of a turret moored fpso subject to environmental forcing is simulated using ariane7 commercially available software developed by bureau veritas bureau veritas 2007 ariane7 is a multi body hydrodynamic software commonly used by offshore oil and gas industry to assess vessel mooring integrity we utilise ariane7 to simulate vessel roll pitch and heave from a six degree of freedom coupled analysis of the vessel and its moorings each simulation randomly generates a wave train and so the simulation output is stochastic consequently each simulation run provides us with a single realisation of the vessel s maximum response thus in its current form probabilistic understanding of the maximum responses requires many executions of the simulator each simulation is run for an equivalent of 3 h as in practice wave spectra may generally only be considered stationary for this time dnv 2014 an initialisation period of 3000 s is specified to allow the vessel to come to equilibrium and a recording time step of 1 s is used a single time domain execution is shown in fig 1 in real time each simulation run requires 30 s to execute so when quantification of output uncertainty is needed the propagation of thousands of input samples through the simulator is infeasible for operations vessel operating conditions correspond to the mean operating draft of 12 m and displacement of 180 000 te to illustrate the methodology presented herein we analyse the vessel response as a function of peak wave period t p with a constant significant wave height and incident wave angle in total 500 simulation runs are used of which we assign 60 for training and the remaining 440 for model validation depiction of the maxima from the training and validation runs for roll pitch and heave are shown in fig 2 for confidentiality the peak wave period has been normalised onto 0 1 3 definition of tail behaviours this research looks at three important extremal quantities the maxima the threshold exceedance data and the quantiles given a series of time domain measurements t 1 t n the maxima is defined as m n max t 1 t n the set of threshold exceedance points as y t i t i u for some threshold u and the α quantile as q α x inf t i 1 n 1 t i x t n α to be clear for a given input x herein corresponding to the peak wave period each simulator run generates a time series output from which we calculate the modelled outputs m n y and q α x to highlight the distinctions between the extremal responses roll response from a single run of the time domain simulator is shown in fig 1 the maximum value is marked by the blue diamond at 7500 s the 95th quantile is shown by the dashed red line and the threshold exceedance data is represented by the purple points above the threshold to aid clarity this colour scheme is upheld throughout the exposition industrial interpretations for these models are as follows the model of simulation maxima allows us to predict the distribution of maximum occurrence for the given simulation length quantile regression of the α quantile estimates the value that will be exceeded α of the time and the model for quantile exceedance quantifies the expected distribution of the data given the data exceeds the α quantile the differences between these models may seem subtle however their interpretations are key to providing industry with a complete view of the extremal processes at hand 4 statistical theory the following section explains the requisite statistical theory required to understand the methodology presented in section 5 first section 4 1 presents basic extreme value theory including quantile regression and second section 4 2 gives an overview of gaussian process modelling the methodology used to induce dependency over the inputs methods and ideas presented within this section have been adapted from many sources most notably background information in section 4 1 relies on de haan and ferreira 2007 sang and gelfand 2009 and coles et al 2001 for traditional ev theory koenker 2005 and yu and moyeed 2001 for quantile regression and section 4 2 relies on sacks et al 1989 kennedy and o hagan 2001 and rasmussen 2004 4 1 extreme value theory the statistics of extremes has grown into a vast area of research both from a methodological and applied standpoint when inference is required in the distributional tails beyond what is available by the data one may appeal to the asymptotic results of ev theory initial findings of asymptotic limiting distributions for extremal data were separately conceived by fréchet 1928 fisher and tippett 1928 and von mises 1936 however it was not until the 1980 s that the field reached a level of maturity as documented by de haan and ferreira 2007 since these developments ev theory has become integral to many research fields with for example recent work seen in environmental modelling joyce et al 2018 econometrics martins filho et al 2018 naval architecture gaidai et al 2018 medical science chiu et al 2018 and solar physics de la luz et al 2018 consider a series of identical and independently distributed iid measurements t 1 t n from a distribution ℱ to model the single most extreme value of the n measurements we focus on the behaviour of m n max t 1 t n in theory we may derive the distribution of m n as 1 p m n t p t 1 t t n t p t 1 t p t n t ℱ n t this is however not accessible when ℱ is unknown one technique is to estimate ℱ and substitute it into equation 1 although problems arise when n is large as small errors in the estimation of ℱ can lead to significant discrepancies in ℱ n instead ev theory asks if there exist distributional families for ℱ n that may be estimated only by the extreme values m n note that this is the extreme value analogy of the central limit theorem where distributional means may be approximated by a normal distribution coles et al 2001 consider z z where z is the smallest value of z such that ℱ z 1 as n ℱ n z 0 and the distribution of m n degenerates to a point mass at z this is not useful to empirical modelling of extreme data the problem of degeneracy is avoided by rescaling m n such that m n m n b n a n for a n 0 and b n r the extremal types theorem then states that for constants a n and b n if 2 p m n b n a n z g z as n where g is a non degenerate function then g must be a member of the gev family a brief proof of this is included in section 3 1 4 of coles et al 2001 4 1 1 generalised extreme value distribution the gev distribution is defined as 3 g z exp 1 ξ z μ σ 1 ξ for ξ 0 and 4 g z exp exp z μ σ for ξ 0 where z is defined on the set z 1 ξ z μ σ 0 with location parameter μ r scale parameter σ 0 and shape parameter ξ r the gev distribution is a generalisation of the three ev distributions the weibull gumbel and frechet distributions unification of the three ev distributions leads to a more robust approach to statistical inference as estimation of the shape parameter ξ naturally selects the distribution most suited to the data the gev distribution is the only distribution that satisfies equation 2 regardless of the data generating distribution ℱ 4 1 2 generalised pareto distribution often we are concerned not only with modelling the maxima but also in modelling threshold exceedance events by utilising more than just the most extreme point modelling peaks over thresholds allows more data to be incorporated into the analysis we describe the threshold exceedance distribution by h t p t t t u ℱ t ℱ u 1 ℱ u for a threshold u as with the gev distribution if the distribution ℱ were known then modelling the threshold exceedance is trivial although this is rarely the case however approximations of h may be made as the threshold u increases to a sufficiently high level suppose that ℱ satisfies the extremal types theorem such that p m n z g z for some μ σ and ξ then for large enough u the distribution h t is approximated by the genp distribution 5 h t 1 1 ξ t u σ 1 ξ t u for ξ 0 and 6 h t 1 exp t u σ t u for ξ 0 where σ σ ξ u μ proof of this is included in the appendix of jonathan and ewans 2013 it is important to note that in many instances of exceedance modelling the threshold value is pre specified however we wish to incorporate covariate effects such as in jonathan et al 2014a in this work the threshold is to be defined by a high quantile as estimated via a quantile regression procedure results shown herein consider the top 5 of the time series data there is no guaranteed selection of the threshold u such that the exceedance data will be genp distributed northrop and coleman 2014 the choice of u must thus be validated after the modelling stages with appropriate diagnostics to confirm that the choice of a genp distribution for the exceedance data is appropriate more discussion on the selection of u is found in scarrott and macdonald 2012 thompson et al 2009 guillou and hall 2001 and tancredi et al 2006 4 1 3 quantile regression quantile regression is an extension of classical regression modelling of conditional mean models to the estimation of models for conditional quantile functions koenker 2005 here we follow the recommendations of jonathan et al 2013 and northrop et al 2016 and use the upper quantiles to provide a meaningful threshold for modelling the threshold exceedance data we define q α x as the true α quantile of the distribution of the time domain measurements t 1 x t n x with input x such that q α x inf t p ℱ x t α due to the inherent stochasticity of the time domain simulation q α x is an unknown function that varies with input x should the distribution of the outputs ℱ be known then q α can be estimated however as discussed in section 4 1 we do not wish to specify a parametric class for ℱ rather we propose the use of the empirical quantile estimates 7 q α x inf t i 1 n 1 t i x t n α for the n data at each observed input location we then obtain predictions of the quantiles q ˆ α x by modelling the empirical estimates q α x as further detailed in section 5 1 2 4 2 gaussian process modelling gaussian processes are a non parametric approach to modelling unknown functions they are widely implemented to solve a variety of regression and classification problems rasmussen 2004 within the bayesian paradigm the modelling approach specifies a prior and predicts directly in the function space with the function properties determined by the governing parameters in the mean and covariance functions define by f x an unknown function on the domain x x suppose n observations of f are made at locations x x 1 x n the goal is to use these observations to predict at n unobserved input locations x x 1 x n the gaussian process prior assumes the observed data are realisations of a multivariate normal distribution f x θ m n m σ 2 σ m is a column matrix with i 1 th elements m i m x i i 1 n and σ is a matrix with i j th elements σ i j λ x i x j i j 1 n here m and λ represent the mean and covariance functions respectively and are both known functions with unknown parameters θ more generally the gaussian process prior may be written in terms of the mean and covariance function f θ g p m λ the gaussian process prior specifies that the conditional distribution of any single output f x given an input x is gaussian furthermore the joint distribution of any finite collection of outputs given corresponding elements in the input space is multivariate gaussian theoretically extended to an infinite number of elements in x given the unobserved input locations x we may express the joint distribution of the observed and the unobserved data as f x f x θ m n m m σ σ σ t σ where m n denotes the multivariate normal distribution m is a column matrix with i 1 th elements m i m x i i 1 n σ is a matrix with i j th elements σ i j λ x i x j i 1 n j 1 n and σ is a matrix with i j th elements σ i j λ x i x j i j 1 n following o hagan 1978 we appeal to multivariate normal theory and condition the unobserved points on the observed points yielding 8 f x f x θ m n m 1 x θ λ 1 x x θ where m 1 x θ m σ t σ 1 y m and λ 1 x x θ σ σ t σ 1 σ thus inference on f at any unobserved region in x may be made conditional on the observed data the posterior predictive density can be obtained by marginalising equation 8 over the uncertain estimates of θ 5 proposed methodology 5 1 model specification we demonstrate three methodologies for the analysis of different types of extremal data the maxima and quantiles are able to be immediately modelled from the data however the threshold exceedance model is dependent on the quantile estimates the three methodologies are included as follows first we build a latent variable model of the simulation maxima then we use quantile regression to obtain estimates of the quantiles finally we use the results of the quantile regression to model the threshold exceedance data also with a latent variable model a summary of this modelling process is seen in fig 3 for the results presented in section 6 x corresponds to the peak wave period t p 5 1 1 simulation maxima we begin by modelling the simulation maxima we impose two requirements first the conditional distributions of the maxima given an input x must be modelled by a gev distribution and second parameters at locations close in the input space must have higher correlation than points far away maxima z z 1 z n t are assumed to be gev distributed and independent conditioned on the corresponding inputs x x 1 x n t the location parameter μ is modelled by a gaussian process the scale parameter σ by a log linear function and the shape parameter ξ z is assumed to be constant over x justification of these modelling choices are as follows μ is modelled via a gaussian process as they are flexible and provide support on r σ is modelled by a log linear model to ensure σ 0 a cubic model is selected as it provides a sufficient degree of flexibility higher order polynomials were examined with no significant improvements in performance according to the diagnostics presented in section 6 finally the choice of ξ to be modelled as constant is primarily pragmatic as variations in ξ are difficult to estimate from the number of data available to the analysis mathematically we express this model as z x i μ x i σ x i ξ z g e v μ x i σ x i ξ z θ β z μ θ g p 0 λ 1 θ σ β z exp x β z x 1 x x 2 x 3 p ξ z θ β z p ξ z p θ p β z where μ μ x i and σ σ x i for i 1 n and β z is a vector of regression coefficients the gaussian process placed over μ utilises the squared exponential covariance function λ 1 x i x j α 1 2 exp x i x j 2 2 l 1 where α 1 is the amplitude parameter and l 1 is the length scale this represents the belief that μ is smooth over the inputs and nearness in the input space implies high correlation in the estimated values of μ distributions p ξ z p θ and p β z are the prior distributions for ξ z θ and β z respectively prior distributions are specified as ξ z n 0 1 θ m c 0 1 and β z n c 0 1 where n is the univariate normal distribution c and c are the half and full cauchy distributions respectively and θ m and β z n denote the mth and nth elements in θ and β z where m 1 dim θ and n 1 dim β z the analysis is fully probabilistic and all estimated uncertainty in the parameters is propagated through to the estimates of the predicted maxima the structure of the design matrix x was selected after some exploratory data analysis as it provided good balance of flexibility and model simplicity given the data z the posterior is expressed as p μ β z ξ z θ z p z μ β z ξ z p μ θ p ξ z θ β z with the posterior predictive distribution for a maxima z at location x defined by 9 p z z p z μ x β z ξ z p μ x θ μ p μ β z ξ z θ z d μ x d μ d β z d ξ z d θ 5 1 2 quantile estimates quantile estimates q α are made at each of the observed inputs x 1 x n as specified in equation 7 we impose the belief that closeness in the input domain impels high correlation in the estimates q α x thus the stipulation of a gaussian process prior with appropriate covariance function is reasonable as detailed in section 4 2 for a zero mean gaussian process predictions of the quantiles q ˆ α at an input x are made following 10 q ˆ α x q α x ϕ m n m 2 x ϕ λ 2 x x ϕ where m 2 x ϕ σ t σ ρ 2 i 1 q α x and λ 2 x x ϕ σ σ t σ ρ 2 i 1 σ matrices σ σ and σ are specified by a squared exponential function λ 2 x i x j α 2 2 exp x i x j 2 2 l 2 where ϕ α 2 2 l 2 the additional parameter ρ 2 accounts for the variation of q α x q α x note that ρ 2 is only applied to the variance covariance matrix of the observed data σ and not with the variance covariance matrix of the unobserved data σ this is so the true quantiles q α are estimated and not the noisy estimates q α 5 1 3 threshold exceedance quantile regression results are used to model the quantile exceedance data such that the threshold u is specified by the posterior fitted mean values of q ˆ α x such that u e m 2 ϕ we further define by y i the set of time series measurements t x i exceeding the threshold u x i such that y i t x i t x i u x i appealing to the statistical methodology in section 4 1 2 we assume the exceedance data y y 1 y n t conditioned on the corresponding inputs x x 1 x n t to be genp distributed as in section 5 1 1 we model σ by a log linear function and the shape parameter ξ y as a constant over x the model is defined as y i u x i σ x i ξ y genp u x i σ x i ξ y ϕ β y u q α x ϕ g p 0 λ 2 ϕ σ β y exp x β y x 1 x x 2 x 3 p ξ y ϕ β y p ξ y p ϕ p β y where ϕ and λ 2 ϕ are as defined in section 5 1 2 β y is a vector of regression coefficients and p ξ y p ϕ and p β y are the prior distributions on ξ y ϕ and β y respectively defined as ξ y n 0 1 ϕ m c 0 1 and β y n c 0 1 where ϕ m and β y n denote the mth and nth elements in ϕ and β y for m 1 dim ϕ and n 1 dim β y in theory the shape parameters ξ z and ξ y should be the same however as different types of data are used to inform the models for maxima and threshold exceedance some variation is expected given the observed data y and quantile estimates q α x the posterior distribution of the unknown parameters is p u β y ξ y ϕ y q α x p y u β y ξ y p u q α x ϕ p ξ y ϕ β y with the posterior predictive distribution for a measurement of threshold exceedance y at location x defined by 11 p y y p y u x β y ξ y p u x u ϕ p u β y ξ y ϕ y q α x d u x d u d β y d ξ y d ϕ 5 2 sampling details for all models the posterior is analytically intractable and so may not be directly sampled from recent advances in mcmc sampling are used to estimate the posterior quantities of interest we implement a no u turns nuts sampling scheme hoffman and gelman 2014 embedded in the probabilistic programming language rstan carpenter et al 2017 all rstan models are available on the first author s github repo https github com astfalckl extreme rstan relies on hamilton monte carlo hmc sampling neal et al 2011 to explore the posterior this has the advantages of using information on the posterior s gradient to explore the space and has been seen to be more efficient in highly constrained correlated spaces than traditional mcmc algorithms girolami and calderhead 2011 6 results with application to fpso vessel motions 6 1 diagnostics of model performance as the developed models are mainly a tool for prediction the model diagnostics used herein focus on the models predictive performance for the maxima and threshold exceedance models we wish to assess the entire predictive distribution rather than some central feature appropriate diagnostics should allow for this and so we utilise coverage and qq density plots explained in sections 6 1 1 and 6 1 2 respectively appropriate validation of the modelled quantiles is less obvious as we aim to model and validate an unobservable quantity following plumlee and tuo 2014 we find the set of parameters whose corresponding mean function minimises the leave one out cross validation index using all the data both training and validation we then use this mean function as an indication of the truth for validation the leave one out cross validation index is defined in section 6 1 3 6 1 1 coverage plots diagnostic plots for emulation were first described in bastos and o hagan 2009 and demonstrated in the context of offshore engineering in astfalck et al 2018b we adapt from this the coverage diagnostic also known as the d α diagnostic bastos and o hagan 2009 coverage calculates the proportion of validation points lying within the predictive intervals of width α given an expected or nominal coverage the diagnostic is evaluated by d α y 1 r r i 1 1 y i pi i α where pi i α denotes the predictive interval bounding α probability at input i and r is the total number of validation points for an accurate model we expect the value of α and d α to be close when d α α the model is lacking in predictive performance and when d α α the model predicts with excessive uncertainty 6 1 2 quantile quantile density plots whilst coverage provides a measure of predictive performance of the model over its entire posterior predictive distribution it does not include knowledge of the specified distributional assumptions when the distributional form of the posterior predictive distribution is known qq plots may be utilised so that the empirical quantiles of the data may be compared to the distributional quantiles for the models of maxima and threshold exceedance we know that when conditioned on the parameters and an input the posterior predictive distributions are gev and genp distributed respectively however when we integrate over the parameters as in equations 9 and 11 the resulting distributions do not retain their respective gev and genp distributional forms past research has evaded this issue by taking single estimates of the parameters we do not do this as we are concerned with the full propagation of uncertainty in our predictive estimates rather for every parameter sample the conditional predictive distributions at every validation location are normalised and the qq plot calculated this information is then collated into a single plot and the quantile densities are calculated for each theoretical quantile we expect that for accurate distributional assumptions the majority of the mass should bound the 45 degree line through the origin 6 1 3 leave one out cross validation index cross validation is a model validation method primarily utilised when prediction is the main goal of the analysis leave one out cross validation systematically excludes a single data point and finds the error between the model s prediction and the data point the leave one out cross validation index is calculated as the sum of the errors for all data points we use the set of parameters that minimise this index as an indication of the truth of u following plumlee and tuo 2014 for the zero mean gaussian process described in equation 10 the leave one out cross validation index for each observation is calculated by e i j ϕ σ 1 ϕ j σ 1 ϕ j j q α x σ ϕ and q α x are as defined in equation 10 j denotes the jth row and j j denotes the jth diagonal element to obtain an estimate of the true quantile process we find the point prediction of the parameters ϕ ˆ such that the leave one out cross validation index is minimised ϕ ˆ arg min i 1 n j 1 m e i j 2 ϕ note that ϕ ˆ is estimated using all the data both training and validation 6 2 modelling maxima results corresponding to the model for maxima specified in section 5 1 1 are seen in fig 4 the darkest banded intervals denote the 90 credible interval of the location parameter μ the medium grey intervals represent the 90 prediction interval of the maxima and the lightest grey intervals represent the 99 prediction interval of the maxima for all motions the model shows clear asymmetry with a heavier tail towards the more extreme values reflecting the generally positive samples of ξ z from the mcmc scheme coverage plots and qq density plots are shown in fig 5 for all motions prediction of the larger quantiles sees slightly excessive uncertainty however it is acceptable the 90 density bounds marked by the dashed lines in the qq density plots bound the theoretical gev quantiles through the whole domain indicating that the specification of gev distributions on the data is appropriate 6 3 modelling quantiles the fitted 95 quantiles modelled as per section 5 1 2 are shown in fig 6 the dotted line indicates the leave one out cross validation fit using both training and validation data treated as an indication of the truth the solid black line represents the fitted posterior mean values for the 95 quantiles trained from the quantile estimates at the training locations denoted by the red crosses it is apparent that the resulting fit is close to the leave one out cross validation fit with root mean square errors of 0 026 0 015 and 0 016 for roll pitch and heave respectively 6 4 modelling threshold exceedance data exceeding the 95th quantiles are modelled as per section 5 1 3 the results are shown in fig 7 the purple points represent the exceedance data from which the threshold exceedance model is estimated the light grey intervals represent the 99 prediction bounds and the dark grey intervals represent the 90 prediction bounds to aid plotting clarity the data has been thinned by a factor of 100 note that these data have only been thinned for plotting purposes but the analysis incorporated the entire dataset diagnostics for this model are available in fig 8 the coverage plots indicate good predictive capabilities of the model for roll the 90 quantile intervals bound the theoretical quantiles through the whole domain for pitch and heave some minor deviations are seen towards the upper quantiles the uncertainty in the qq density plots for the threshold exceedance data is much less than for maxima data this is due to more data being available in the fitting of the model and thus a better prediction of the underlying process 7 discussion 7 1 near real time inputs to decision analysis a fundamental motivation of this paper is to provide predictions of the extremal vessel motions to inform decision analysis particularly in the offshore engineering industries decision making for operations often needs to be made swiftly and reactively to changing metocean input conditions it is thus imperative for any predictive tool to be fast and accurate in its execution accuracy of the methodology is demonstrated in the results in section 6 execution of the methodology involves simple computational tasks including the numerical integrations in equations 9 and 11 given a sample from the distributions of inputs and the parameters distributions of the vessel s maxima and threshold exceedance models are estimated in 2 ms thus the numerical integration over the predictive input density and the uncertain parameters is executable in a matter of seconds when compared to the original simulator the demonstrated methodology predicts the extremal motions 15 000 times faster we note that the run time of the statistical methodology is independent of the computational cost of the simulator and so may be expected to be constant regardless of the choice of simulator 7 2 probabilistic estimation of return vales often in industrial settings quantification of extremes is described in terms of return values calculated either non parametrically or parametrically jonathan et al 2014b return values describe the size of an event that is expected to occur once in a return period p for example the return value of a 100 year wave describes the wave that occurs annually with probability 0 01 typically return periods of extreme inputs are discussed in the order of tens to thousands of years and the corresponding return values act as inputs into survival analyses during design salvadori et al 2015 this standard application of return values does not however prevent their use for shorter term extreme value predictions for example say we wish to model the maximum expected vessel motion over a five day cyclone event the data from the 3 h simulations may be used to predict the five day return value and subsequently used to inform the go or no go decision of the vessel with the specification of a parametric distribution the calculation of the return value is mathematically available here the return values for the extremal distributions of vessel motions corresponding to a period p 1 p are defined as 12 z p μ σ ξ z 1 log 1 p n t 1 ξ z and 13 y p u σ ξ y n p p ζ u ξ y 1 for the gev and genp distributions respectively here n t is the number of time domain simulation lengths t n per unit p n p is the number of time steps t i t i 1 per unit p ζ u p t u with estimator ζ ˆ u k n where k is the number of exceedances from a simulation of n time steps and the remaining parameters are as defined in sections 4 1 1 and 4 1 2 uncertainty in the parameters in equations 12 and 13 yields uncertainty in the estimated return values to form a probabilistic prediction of the return value there are two uncertainty sources that must be accounted for uncertainty in the model parameters and uncertainty in the predicted inputs the return values z p and y p may be probabilistically estimated as follows consider random samples of an environmental forecast x ˆ 1 x ˆ n ˆ where each x ˆ i is drawn from a predictive distribution x ˆ i q x ˆ equations 12 and 13 may be re written to be dependent on an input value x ˆ i such that z p x ˆ i μ x ˆ i σ x ˆ i ξ z 1 log 1 p n t 1 ξ z and y p x ˆ i u x ˆ i σ x ˆ i ξ y n p p ζ u ξ y 1 note that μ u σ σ ξ z and ξ y are all themselves uncertain with predictive densities given by their mcmc samples as described in section 5 to provide marginal probabilistic descriptions of z p and y p we integrate over the distributions of the parameters and the environmental forecast q x ˆ such that p z p z p z p μ ˆ β z ξ z p μ ˆ θ μ x ˆ p μ β z ξ z θ z q x ˆ d μ ˆ d μ d β z d ξ z d θ d x ˆ and p y p y p z p u ˆ β y ξ y p u ˆ ϕ u x ˆ p u β y ξ y ϕ y q x ˆ d

multivariate inputs this work analyses the effects of peak wave period on the maximum vessel motions this univariate analysis has allowed the visual demonstration of the methodology extension of the models to multivariate inputs is possible where the parameter structures are described by multivariate inputs trivial for gaussian processes and log linear functions as the size of the input space grows with increasing dimensions more data are needed to accurately model the extremal processes especially for the models of maxima this will increase the posterior dimensionality future work is ongoing to extend the methodology presented to model vessel response as a function of significant wave height peak wave period and incident wave direction 7 4 alternate method for modelling threshold exceedance data in our industrial experience often we do not have access to the full time domain simulation output historical or otherwise rather simulation runs are recorded by their statistical summaries where this is the case estimates of threshold exceedance may still be provided from knowledge of the quantiles and the maxima as is shown in section 4 1 2 ξ y and σ may be obtained from the gev parameter estimates of ξ z σ μ the threshold values u are obtained from the results of the quantile regression given by u q ˆ α as all required parameters are theoretically known functions of existing parameter estimates prediction of the quantile exceedance data requires no further probabilistic parameter quantification the predictive posterior distribution of y at an input x may thus be expressed as 14 p y z p y q ˆ α x μ x β z ξ z p q ˆ α x q α x ϕ ρ 2 p μ x μ θ p μ β z ξ z θ ϕ ρ 2 z d μ d β z d ξ z d θ d ϕ d ρ 2 where y q ˆ α x μ x β z ξ z genp u x σ x ξ z ϕ θ β z ρ 2 μ as an example diagnostic results of this model for roll are seen in fig 9 the model retains good predictive performance as seen in the coverage plot however the qq density plot indicates that there is far more uncertainty in the parameter estimates this is to be expected as there is far less data available to the model as only the 60 maximum values are utilised as opposed to the 32 400 exceedance points used in section 6 4 where possible we recommend the use of the method presented in section 5 1 3 as more data are available for accurate modelling however should historical simulator runs only be recorded by the statistical summaries this alternate method is a possibility 8 conclusion extremal data from a time domain simulation of fpso vessel motions is modelled as a function of the peak wave period the incorporation of covariate effects to the extremal modelling of dynamic structures is novel to offshore engineering frameworks for the fast and accurate analysis of time domain maxima quantiles and quantile exceedance data are provided two diagnostics are introduced to assess the maxima and threshold exceedance models coverage plots and qq density plots analysis of the diagnostics suggest that the developed models and assumptions are satisfactory a speed increase of 15 000 times is seen when comparing the developed models to the original simulator enabling the use of the techniques demonstrated herein for operational decision making understanding each type of extremal output with uncertainty contributes to forming a complete picture of the predicted extremal behaviour of the vessel it is demonstrated that latent variable modelling combined with quantile regression offers an accurate and efficient technique to quantify non stationary extremal responses subject to covariate effects the methods shown are generalisable and applicable to a wide range of offshore engineering problems acknowledgements this research was supported by the arc industrial transformation

22820,prediction of the extremal responses of dynamic structures is a vital step in the risk management of offshore assets often when modelling structural response the outputs are dependent on covariates defined on a continuous input domain we demonstrate a methodology to allow for continuous covariates in extremal modelling by building latent variable models whereby output dependencies are incorporated by smooth processes in the latent parameters this allows information from close by input regions to be shared when forming inference at unseen inputs we illustrate the methodology using a computational simulation of floating production storage and offloading fpso vessel motions modelled as functions of the peak wave period we provide methodologies and diagnostics for the modelling of the time domain maxima quantiles and threshold exceedance data there are three contributions made by this research a methodology to predict the extremal outputs from a time domain simulator with incorporation of continuous covariate knowledge significant speed increase when using the developed methodology as a computational proxy to the simulator and a framework for the probabilistic quantification of the output uncertainty of the extremal data keywords extremal data latent variable model uncertainty quantification dynamic structures fpso vessel motions bayesian statistics 1 introduction existing frameworks for the analysis of extremal data in offshore engineering primarily focus on the prediction of extreme environmental conditions e g jonathan and ewans 2013 in parallel there is a growing need for methodologies to predict and quantify uncertainty surrounding extremal structural motions for operational risk management and decision making operational strategies frequently rely upon simulated structural dynamics that are the outputs of complex functions the inputs of which are metocean parameters bitner gregersen 2015 although technological advances have meant near real time predictive tools are increasingly desired in industrial settings khan et al 2016 this can be infeasible with some simulators astfalck et al 2018b describe how a statistical surrogate of a simulator a k a an emulator can execute evaluations 60 000 times faster than a simulator of mean turret offset and produce reliable predictions this article extends the work of astfalck et al 2018b to a methodology that emulates extremal features of outputs from a simulator that requires only the parsimonious usage of training data to provide fast and accurate predictive performance we model the extremal realisations from the time domain computer simulation of a turret moored floating production storage and offloading fpso vessel with inputs specified by the environmental forcing to align with industry standards dnv 2014 3 h time domain simulations of the vessel motions are used the vessel of interest is currently mooring in the australian north west shelf one of australia s most economically significant maritime regions the australian north west shelf is subject to metocean conditions with high spatio temporal variation due to phenomena such as frequent internal waves strong and sporadic eddies tropical cyclones and perennial swell astfalck et al 2018a it is vital to the safety of the vessel to predict when metocean conditions are expected to lead to unfavourable local motions as work may become unsafe and subsequently halted until the vessel stabilises the decision to halt work is costly and must be balanced with the risk of injury and asset damage mcbride 2012 over caution leads to superfluous economic loss conversely under caution may lead to economic social and environmental consequences this research is motivated by the need to predict the distributions of vessel extreme behaviours in a timely and accurate manner statistical extreme value ev theory provides a mathematical framework in which to quantify the extremal behaviour of measured quantities coles et al 2001 asymptotic arguments allow for the distributions of maxima and threshold exceedance data to be quantified without the need to model the main body of the data de haan and ferreira 2007 modelling the maxima is immediately possible from the time series data however modelling the threshold exceedance evaluations relies on the specification of a threshold it is seldom clear what value this threshold should take as it is required to be high enough for the asymptotic arguments to hold but low enough to leverage sufficient data ross et al 2017 alternatively thresholds may be specified by domain experts to provide values that are meaningful for operations in the absence of such criteria we use quantile regression to set a threshold to correspond to a high covariate dependent quantile of the time series data quantile regression is used to estimate the quantile values providing a meaningful threshold in the modelling of the threshold exceedance data this modelling process yields predictions for three extremal quantities maxima threshold exceedance motions and quantiles the simulator s maxima and threshold exceedance outputs are assumed to either be realisations of generalised extreme value gev or generalised pareto genp distributions the paramaters of which are functions of the input space simulator output dependencies are induced by modelling the gev and genp parameters as smooth functions over the input space we implement the latent variable model in a bayesian framework this allows for the inclusion of prior beliefs and the use of markov chain monte carlo mcmc sampling to numerically integrate over the analytically intractable latent space metropolis et al 1953 hastings 1970 three motions key to vessel operability are analysed as a function of the peak wave period heave pitch and roll to assess model performance two diagnostics are introduced we utilise coverage plots and quantile quantile qq density plots to examine the models of maxima and threshold exceedance over the entire predictive distribution for the quantiles the resulting fit from minimising leave one out cross validation over both the training and validation data is used as a measure of truth and the quantile regression results are compared to this fit using the root mean squared error the demonstrated methodologies provide a good basis for the fast and accurate modelling of extremal data over a continuous input space due to the specification of covariance between inputs relatively small numbers of simulations are required by the modelling the scope of the research has been developed in conjunction with industry and future avenues for deployment are being investigated the paper proceeds as follows section 2 reviews the simulator of vessel motions and presents the maxima data section 3 defines the three analysed tail behaviours section 4 describes the background statistical knowledge section 5 specifies the latent variable models section 6 presents the results with diagnostics section 7 provides discussion and outlines future avenues of development and section 8 offers conclusions from the research code used in the research is available on the first author s github repository https github com astfalckl extreme as the analysed data are confidential a synthetic dataset has been generated and uploaded to be used with the developed code 2 simulator of fpso vessel motions the dynamic responses of a turret moored fpso subject to environmental forcing is simulated using ariane7 commercially available software developed by bureau veritas bureau veritas 2007 ariane7 is a multi body hydrodynamic software commonly used by offshore oil and gas industry to assess vessel mooring integrity we utilise ariane7 to simulate vessel roll pitch and heave from a six degree of freedom coupled analysis of the vessel and its moorings each simulation randomly generates a wave train and so the simulation output is stochastic consequently each simulation run provides us with a single realisation of the vessel s maximum response thus in its current form probabilistic understanding of the maximum responses requires many executions of the simulator each simulation is run for an equivalent of 3 h as in practice wave spectra may generally only be considered stationary for this time dnv 2014 an initialisation period of 3000 s is specified to allow the vessel to come to equilibrium and a recording time step of 1 s is used a single time domain execution is shown in fig 1 in real time each simulation run requires 30 s to execute so when quantification of output uncertainty is needed the propagation of thousands of input samples through the simulator is infeasible for operations vessel operating conditions correspond to the mean operating draft of 12 m and displacement of 180 000 te to illustrate the methodology presented herein we analyse the vessel response as a function of peak wave period t p with a constant significant wave height and incident wave angle in total 500 simulation runs are used of which we assign 60 for training and the remaining 440 for model validation depiction of the maxima from the training and validation runs for roll pitch and heave are shown in fig 2 for confidentiality the peak wave period has been normalised onto 0 1 3 definition of tail behaviours this research looks at three important extremal quantities the maxima the threshold exceedance data and the quantiles given a series of time domain measurements t 1 t n the maxima is defined as m n max t 1 t n the set of threshold exceedance points as y t i t i u for some threshold u and the α quantile as q α x inf t i 1 n 1 t i x t n α to be clear for a given input x herein corresponding to the peak wave period each simulator run generates a time series output from which we calculate the modelled outputs m n y and q α x to highlight the distinctions between the extremal responses roll response from a single run of the time domain simulator is shown in fig 1 the maximum value is marked by the blue diamond at 7500 s the 95th quantile is shown by the dashed red line and the threshold exceedance data is represented by the purple points above the threshold to aid clarity this colour scheme is upheld throughout the exposition industrial interpretations for these models are as follows the model of simulation maxima allows us to predict the distribution of maximum occurrence for the given simulation length quantile regression of the α quantile estimates the value that will be exceeded α of the time and the model for quantile exceedance quantifies the expected distribution of the data given the data exceeds the α quantile the differences between these models may seem subtle however their interpretations are key to providing industry with a complete view of the extremal processes at hand 4 statistical theory the following section explains the requisite statistical theory required to understand the methodology presented in section 5 first section 4 1 presents basic extreme value theory including quantile regression and second section 4 2 gives an overview of gaussian process modelling the methodology used to induce dependency over the inputs methods and ideas presented within this section have been adapted from many sources most notably background information in section 4 1 relies on de haan and ferreira 2007 sang and gelfand 2009 and coles et al 2001 for traditional ev theory koenker 2005 and yu and moyeed 2001 for quantile regression and section 4 2 relies on sacks et al 1989 kennedy and o hagan 2001 and rasmussen 2004 4 1 extreme value theory the statistics of extremes has grown into a vast area of research both from a methodological and applied standpoint when inference is required in the distributional tails beyond what is available by the data one may appeal to the asymptotic results of ev theory initial findings of asymptotic limiting distributions for extremal data were separately conceived by fréchet 1928 fisher and tippett 1928 and von mises 1936 however it was not until the 1980 s that the field reached a level of maturity as documented by de haan and ferreira 2007 since these developments ev theory has become integral to many research fields with for example recent work seen in environmental modelling joyce et al 2018 econometrics martins filho et al 2018 naval architecture gaidai et al 2018 medical science chiu et al 2018 and solar physics de la luz et al 2018 consider a series of identical and independently distributed iid measurements t 1 t n from a distribution ℱ to model the single most extreme value of the n measurements we focus on the behaviour of m n max t 1 t n in theory we may derive the distribution of m n as 1 p m n t p t 1 t t n t p t 1 t p t n t ℱ n t this is however not accessible when ℱ is unknown one technique is to estimate ℱ and substitute it into equation 1 although problems arise when n is large as small errors in the estimation of ℱ can lead to significant discrepancies in ℱ n instead ev theory asks if there exist distributional families for ℱ n that may be estimated only by the extreme values m n note that this is the extreme value analogy of the central limit theorem where distributional means may be approximated by a normal distribution coles et al 2001 consider z z where z is the smallest value of z such that ℱ z 1 as n ℱ n z 0 and the distribution of m n degenerates to a point mass at z this is not useful to empirical modelling of extreme data the problem of degeneracy is avoided by rescaling m n such that m n m n b n a n for a n 0 and b n r the extremal types theorem then states that for constants a n and b n if 2 p m n b n a n z g z as n where g is a non degenerate function then g must be a member of the gev family a brief proof of this is included in section 3 1 4 of coles et al 2001 4 1 1 generalised extreme value distribution the gev distribution is defined as 3 g z exp 1 ξ z μ σ 1 ξ for ξ 0 and 4 g z exp exp z μ σ for ξ 0 where z is defined on the set z 1 ξ z μ σ 0 with location parameter μ r scale parameter σ 0 and shape parameter ξ r the gev distribution is a generalisation of the three ev distributions the weibull gumbel and frechet distributions unification of the three ev distributions leads to a more robust approach to statistical inference as estimation of the shape parameter ξ naturally selects the distribution most suited to the data the gev distribution is the only distribution that satisfies equation 2 regardless of the data generating distribution ℱ 4 1 2 generalised pareto distribution often we are concerned not only with modelling the maxima but also in modelling threshold exceedance events by utilising more than just the most extreme point modelling peaks over thresholds allows more data to be incorporated into the analysis we describe the threshold exceedance distribution by h t p t t t u ℱ t ℱ u 1 ℱ u for a threshold u as with the gev distribution if the distribution ℱ were known then modelling the threshold exceedance is trivial although this is rarely the case however approximations of h may be made as the threshold u increases to a sufficiently high level suppose that ℱ satisfies the extremal types theorem such that p m n z g z for some μ σ and ξ then for large enough u the distribution h t is approximated by the genp distribution 5 h t 1 1 ξ t u σ 1 ξ t u for ξ 0 and 6 h t 1 exp t u σ t u for ξ 0 where σ σ ξ u μ proof of this is included in the appendix of jonathan and ewans 2013 it is important to note that in many instances of exceedance modelling the threshold value is pre specified however we wish to incorporate covariate effects such as in jonathan et al 2014a in this work the threshold is to be defined by a high quantile as estimated via a quantile regression procedure results shown herein consider the top 5 of the time series data there is no guaranteed selection of the threshold u such that the exceedance data will be genp distributed northrop and coleman 2014 the choice of u must thus be validated after the modelling stages with appropriate diagnostics to confirm that the choice of a genp distribution for the exceedance data is appropriate more discussion on the selection of u is found in scarrott and macdonald 2012 thompson et al 2009 guillou and hall 2001 and tancredi et al 2006 4 1 3 quantile regression quantile regression is an extension of classical regression modelling of conditional mean models to the estimation of models for conditional quantile functions koenker 2005 here we follow the recommendations of jonathan et al 2013 and northrop et al 2016 and use the upper quantiles to provide a meaningful threshold for modelling the threshold exceedance data we define q α x as the true α quantile of the distribution of the time domain measurements t 1 x t n x with input x such that q α x inf t p ℱ x t α due to the inherent stochasticity of the time domain simulation q α x is an unknown function that varies with input x should the distribution of the outputs ℱ be known then q α can be estimated however as discussed in section 4 1 we do not wish to specify a parametric class for ℱ rather we propose the use of the empirical quantile estimates 7 q α x inf t i 1 n 1 t i x t n α for the n data at each observed input location we then obtain predictions of the quantiles q ˆ α x by modelling the empirical estimates q α x as further detailed in section 5 1 2 4 2 gaussian process modelling gaussian processes are a non parametric approach to modelling unknown functions they are widely implemented to solve a variety of regression and classification problems rasmussen 2004 within the bayesian paradigm the modelling approach specifies a prior and predicts directly in the function space with the function properties determined by the governing parameters in the mean and covariance functions define by f x an unknown function on the domain x x suppose n observations of f are made at locations x x 1 x n the goal is to use these observations to predict at n unobserved input locations x x 1 x n the gaussian process prior assumes the observed data are realisations of a multivariate normal distribution f x θ m n m σ 2 σ m is a column matrix with i 1 th elements m i m x i i 1 n and σ is a matrix with i j th elements σ i j λ x i x j i j 1 n here m and λ represent the mean and covariance functions respectively and are both known functions with unknown parameters θ more generally the gaussian process prior may be written in terms of the mean and covariance function f θ g p m λ the gaussian process prior specifies that the conditional distribution of any single output f x given an input x is gaussian furthermore the joint distribution of any finite collection of outputs given corresponding elements in the input space is multivariate gaussian theoretically extended to an infinite number of elements in x given the unobserved input locations x we may express the joint distribution of the observed and the unobserved data as f x f x θ m n m m σ σ σ t σ where m n denotes the multivariate normal distribution m is a column matrix with i 1 th elements m i m x i i 1 n σ is a matrix with i j th elements σ i j λ x i x j i 1 n j 1 n and σ is a matrix with i j th elements σ i j λ x i x j i j 1 n following o hagan 1978 we appeal to multivariate normal theory and condition the unobserved points on the observed points yielding 8 f x f x θ m n m 1 x θ λ 1 x x θ where m 1 x θ m σ t σ 1 y m and λ 1 x x θ σ σ t σ 1 σ thus inference on f at any unobserved region in x may be made conditional on the observed data the posterior predictive density can be obtained by marginalising equation 8 over the uncertain estimates of θ 5 proposed methodology 5 1 model specification we demonstrate three methodologies for the analysis of different types of extremal data the maxima and quantiles are able to be immediately modelled from the data however the threshold exceedance model is dependent on the quantile estimates the three methodologies are included as follows first we build a latent variable model of the simulation maxima then we use quantile regression to obtain estimates of the quantiles finally we use the results of the quantile regression to model the threshold exceedance data also with a latent variable model a summary of this modelling process is seen in fig 3 for the results presented in section 6 x corresponds to the peak wave period t p 5 1 1 simulation maxima we begin by modelling the simulation maxima we impose two requirements first the conditional distributions of the maxima given an input x must be modelled by a gev distribution and second parameters at locations close in the input space must have higher correlation than points far away maxima z z 1 z n t are assumed to be gev distributed and independent conditioned on the corresponding inputs x x 1 x n t the location parameter μ is modelled by a gaussian process the scale parameter σ by a log linear function and the shape parameter ξ z is assumed to be constant over x justification of these modelling choices are as follows μ is modelled via a gaussian process as they are flexible and provide support on r σ is modelled by a log linear model to ensure σ 0 a cubic model is selected as it provides a sufficient degree of flexibility higher order polynomials were examined with no significant improvements in performance according to the diagnostics presented in section 6 finally the choice of ξ to be modelled as constant is primarily pragmatic as variations in ξ are difficult to estimate from the number of data available to the analysis mathematically we express this model as z x i μ x i σ x i ξ z g e v μ x i σ x i ξ z θ β z μ θ g p 0 λ 1 θ σ β z exp x β z x 1 x x 2 x 3 p ξ z θ β z p ξ z p θ p β z where μ μ x i and σ σ x i for i 1 n and β z is a vector of regression coefficients the gaussian process placed over μ utilises the squared exponential covariance function λ 1 x i x j α 1 2 exp x i x j 2 2 l 1 where α 1 is the amplitude parameter and l 1 is the length scale this represents the belief that μ is smooth over the inputs and nearness in the input space implies high correlation in the estimated values of μ distributions p ξ z p θ and p β z are the prior distributions for ξ z θ and β z respectively prior distributions are specified as ξ z n 0 1 θ m c 0 1 and β z n c 0 1 where n is the univariate normal distribution c and c are the half and full cauchy distributions respectively and θ m and β z n denote the mth and nth elements in θ and β z where m 1 dim θ and n 1 dim β z the analysis is fully probabilistic and all estimated uncertainty in the parameters is propagated through to the estimates of the predicted maxima the structure of the design matrix x was selected after some exploratory data analysis as it provided good balance of flexibility and model simplicity given the data z the posterior is expressed as p μ β z ξ z θ z p z μ β z ξ z p μ θ p ξ z θ β z with the posterior predictive distribution for a maxima z at location x defined by 9 p z z p z μ x β z ξ z p μ x θ μ p μ β z ξ z θ z d μ x d μ d β z d ξ z d θ 5 1 2 quantile estimates quantile estimates q α are made at each of the observed inputs x 1 x n as specified in equation 7 we impose the belief that closeness in the input domain impels high correlation in the estimates q α x thus the stipulation of a gaussian process prior with appropriate covariance function is reasonable as detailed in section 4 2 for a zero mean gaussian process predictions of the quantiles q ˆ α at an input x are made following 10 q ˆ α x q α x ϕ m n m 2 x ϕ λ 2 x x ϕ where m 2 x ϕ σ t σ ρ 2 i 1 q α x and λ 2 x x ϕ σ σ t σ ρ 2 i 1 σ matrices σ σ and σ are specified by a squared exponential function λ 2 x i x j α 2 2 exp x i x j 2 2 l 2 where ϕ α 2 2 l 2 the additional parameter ρ 2 accounts for the variation of q α x q α x note that ρ 2 is only applied to the variance covariance matrix of the observed data σ and not with the variance covariance matrix of the unobserved data σ this is so the true quantiles q α are estimated and not the noisy estimates q α 5 1 3 threshold exceedance quantile regression results are used to model the quantile exceedance data such that the threshold u is specified by the posterior fitted mean values of q ˆ α x such that u e m 2 ϕ we further define by y i the set of time series measurements t x i exceeding the threshold u x i such that y i t x i t x i u x i appealing to the statistical methodology in section 4 1 2 we assume the exceedance data y y 1 y n t conditioned on the corresponding inputs x x 1 x n t to be genp distributed as in section 5 1 1 we model σ by a log linear function and the shape parameter ξ y as a constant over x the model is defined as y i u x i σ x i ξ y genp u x i σ x i ξ y ϕ β y u q α x ϕ g p 0 λ 2 ϕ σ β y exp x β y x 1 x x 2 x 3 p ξ y ϕ β y p ξ y p ϕ p β y where ϕ and λ 2 ϕ are as defined in section 5 1 2 β y is a vector of regression coefficients and p ξ y p ϕ and p β y are the prior distributions on ξ y ϕ and β y respectively defined as ξ y n 0 1 ϕ m c 0 1 and β y n c 0 1 where ϕ m and β y n denote the mth and nth elements in ϕ and β y for m 1 dim ϕ and n 1 dim β y in theory the shape parameters ξ z and ξ y should be the same however as different types of data are used to inform the models for maxima and threshold exceedance some variation is expected given the observed data y and quantile estimates q α x the posterior distribution of the unknown parameters is p u β y ξ y ϕ y q α x p y u β y ξ y p u q α x ϕ p ξ y ϕ β y with the posterior predictive distribution for a measurement of threshold exceedance y at location x defined by 11 p y y p y u x β y ξ y p u x u ϕ p u β y ξ y ϕ y q α x d u x d u d β y d ξ y d ϕ 5 2 sampling details for all models the posterior is analytically intractable and so may not be directly sampled from recent advances in mcmc sampling are used to estimate the posterior quantities of interest we implement a no u turns nuts sampling scheme hoffman and gelman 2014 embedded in the probabilistic programming language rstan carpenter et al 2017 all rstan models are available on the first author s github repo https github com astfalckl extreme rstan relies on hamilton monte carlo hmc sampling neal et al 2011 to explore the posterior this has the advantages of using information on the posterior s gradient to explore the space and has been seen to be more efficient in highly constrained correlated spaces than traditional mcmc algorithms girolami and calderhead 2011 6 results with application to fpso vessel motions 6 1 diagnostics of model performance as the developed models are mainly a tool for prediction the model diagnostics used herein focus on the models predictive performance for the maxima and threshold exceedance models we wish to assess the entire predictive distribution rather than some central feature appropriate diagnostics should allow for this and so we utilise coverage and qq density plots explained in sections 6 1 1 and 6 1 2 respectively appropriate validation of the modelled quantiles is less obvious as we aim to model and validate an unobservable quantity following plumlee and tuo 2014 we find the set of parameters whose corresponding mean function minimises the leave one out cross validation index using all the data both training and validation we then use this mean function as an indication of the truth for validation the leave one out cross validation index is defined in section 6 1 3 6 1 1 coverage plots diagnostic plots for emulation were first described in bastos and o hagan 2009 and demonstrated in the context of offshore engineering in astfalck et al 2018b we adapt from this the coverage diagnostic also known as the d α diagnostic bastos and o hagan 2009 coverage calculates the proportion of validation points lying within the predictive intervals of width α given an expected or nominal coverage the diagnostic is evaluated by d α y 1 r r i 1 1 y i pi i α where pi i α denotes the predictive interval bounding α probability at input i and r is the total number of validation points for an accurate model we expect the value of α and d α to be close when d α α the model is lacking in predictive performance and when d α α the model predicts with excessive uncertainty 6 1 2 quantile quantile density plots whilst coverage provides a measure of predictive performance of the model over its entire posterior predictive distribution it does not include knowledge of the specified distributional assumptions when the distributional form of the posterior predictive distribution is known qq plots may be utilised so that the empirical quantiles of the data may be compared to the distributional quantiles for the models of maxima and threshold exceedance we know that when conditioned on the parameters and an input the posterior predictive distributions are gev and genp distributed respectively however when we integrate over the parameters as in equations 9 and 11 the resulting distributions do not retain their respective gev and genp distributional forms past research has evaded this issue by taking single estimates of the parameters we do not do this as we are concerned with the full propagation of uncertainty in our predictive estimates rather for every parameter sample the conditional predictive distributions at every validation location are normalised and the qq plot calculated this information is then collated into a single plot and the quantile densities are calculated for each theoretical quantile we expect that for accurate distributional assumptions the majority of the mass should bound the 45 degree line through the origin 6 1 3 leave one out cross validation index cross validation is a model validation method primarily utilised when prediction is the main goal of the analysis leave one out cross validation systematically excludes a single data point and finds the error between the model s prediction and the data point the leave one out cross validation index is calculated as the sum of the errors for all data points we use the set of parameters that minimise this index as an indication of the truth of u following plumlee and tuo 2014 for the zero mean gaussian process described in equation 10 the leave one out cross validation index for each observation is calculated by e i j ϕ σ 1 ϕ j σ 1 ϕ j j q α x σ ϕ and q α x are as defined in equation 10 j denotes the jth row and j j denotes the jth diagonal element to obtain an estimate of the true quantile process we find the point prediction of the parameters ϕ ˆ such that the leave one out cross validation index is minimised ϕ ˆ arg min i 1 n j 1 m e i j 2 ϕ note that ϕ ˆ is estimated using all the data both training and validation 6 2 modelling maxima results corresponding to the model for maxima specified in section 5 1 1 are seen in fig 4 the darkest banded intervals denote the 90 credible interval of the location parameter μ the medium grey intervals represent the 90 prediction interval of the maxima and the lightest grey intervals represent the 99 prediction interval of the maxima for all motions the model shows clear asymmetry with a heavier tail towards the more extreme values reflecting the generally positive samples of ξ z from the mcmc scheme coverage plots and qq density plots are shown in fig 5 for all motions prediction of the larger quantiles sees slightly excessive uncertainty however it is acceptable the 90 density bounds marked by the dashed lines in the qq density plots bound the theoretical gev quantiles through the whole domain indicating that the specification of gev distributions on the data is appropriate 6 3 modelling quantiles the fitted 95 quantiles modelled as per section 5 1 2 are shown in fig 6 the dotted line indicates the leave one out cross validation fit using both training and validation data treated as an indication of the truth the solid black line represents the fitted posterior mean values for the 95 quantiles trained from the quantile estimates at the training locations denoted by the red crosses it is apparent that the resulting fit is close to the leave one out cross validation fit with root mean square errors of 0 026 0 015 and 0 016 for roll pitch and heave respectively 6 4 modelling threshold exceedance data exceeding the 95th quantiles are modelled as per section 5 1 3 the results are shown in fig 7 the purple points represent the exceedance data from which the threshold exceedance model is estimated the light grey intervals represent the 99 prediction bounds and the dark grey intervals represent the 90 prediction bounds to aid plotting clarity the data has been thinned by a factor of 100 note that these data have only been thinned for plotting purposes but the analysis incorporated the entire dataset diagnostics for this model are available in fig 8 the coverage plots indicate good predictive capabilities of the model for roll the 90 quantile intervals bound the theoretical quantiles through the whole domain for pitch and heave some minor deviations are seen towards the upper quantiles the uncertainty in the qq density plots for the threshold exceedance data is much less than for maxima data this is due to more data being available in the fitting of the model and thus a better prediction of the underlying process 7 discussion 7 1 near real time inputs to decision analysis a fundamental motivation of this paper is to provide predictions of the extremal vessel motions to inform decision analysis particularly in the offshore engineering industries decision making for operations often needs to be made swiftly and reactively to changing metocean input conditions it is thus imperative for any predictive tool to be fast and accurate in its execution accuracy of the methodology is demonstrated in the results in section 6 execution of the methodology involves simple computational tasks including the numerical integrations in equations 9 and 11 given a sample from the distributions of inputs and the parameters distributions of the vessel s maxima and threshold exceedance models are estimated in 2 ms thus the numerical integration over the predictive input density and the uncertain parameters is executable in a matter of seconds when compared to the original simulator the demonstrated methodology predicts the extremal motions 15 000 times faster we note that the run time of the statistical methodology is independent of the computational cost of the simulator and so may be expected to be constant regardless of the choice of simulator 7 2 probabilistic estimation of return vales often in industrial settings quantification of extremes is described in terms of return values calculated either non parametrically or parametrically jonathan et al 2014b return values describe the size of an event that is expected to occur once in a return period p for example the return value of a 100 year wave describes the wave that occurs annually with probability 0 01 typically return periods of extreme inputs are discussed in the order of tens to thousands of years and the corresponding return values act as inputs into survival analyses during design salvadori et al 2015 this standard application of return values does not however prevent their use for shorter term extreme value predictions for example say we wish to model the maximum expected vessel motion over a five day cyclone event the data from the 3 h simulations may be used to predict the five day return value and subsequently used to inform the go or no go decision of the vessel with the specification of a parametric distribution the calculation of the return value is mathematically available here the return values for the extremal distributions of vessel motions corresponding to a period p 1 p are defined as 12 z p μ σ ξ z 1 log 1 p n t 1 ξ z and 13 y p u σ ξ y n p p ζ u ξ y 1 for the gev and genp distributions respectively here n t is the number of time domain simulation lengths t n per unit p n p is the number of time steps t i t i 1 per unit p ζ u p t u with estimator ζ ˆ u k n where k is the number of exceedances from a simulation of n time steps and the remaining parameters are as defined in sections 4 1 1 and 4 1 2 uncertainty in the parameters in equations 12 and 13 yields uncertainty in the estimated return values to form a probabilistic prediction of the return value there are two uncertainty sources that must be accounted for uncertainty in the model parameters and uncertainty in the predicted inputs the return values z p and y p may be probabilistically estimated as follows consider random samples of an environmental forecast x ˆ 1 x ˆ n ˆ where each x ˆ i is drawn from a predictive distribution x ˆ i q x ˆ equations 12 and 13 may be re written to be dependent on an input value x ˆ i such that z p x ˆ i μ x ˆ i σ x ˆ i ξ z 1 log 1 p n t 1 ξ z and y p x ˆ i u x ˆ i σ x ˆ i ξ y n p p ζ u ξ y 1 note that μ u σ σ ξ z and ξ y are all themselves uncertain with predictive densities given by their mcmc samples as described in section 5 to provide marginal probabilistic descriptions of z p and y p we integrate over the distributions of the parameters and the environmental forecast q x ˆ such that p z p z p z p μ ˆ β z ξ z p μ ˆ θ μ x ˆ p μ β z ξ z θ z q x ˆ d μ ˆ d μ d β z d ξ z d θ d x ˆ and p y p y p z p u ˆ β y ξ y p u ˆ ϕ u x ˆ p u β y ξ y ϕ y q x ˆ d u ˆ d u d β y d ξ y d ϕ d x ˆ where μ ˆ μ x ˆ i and u ˆ u x ˆ i for i 1 n ˆ this yields probabilistic estimates of the return values p z p and p y p for a specified return period p 7 3 methodology for multivariate inputs this work analyses the effects of peak wave period on the maximum vessel motions this univariate analysis has allowed the visual demonstration of the methodology extension of the models to multivariate inputs is possible where the parameter structures are described by multivariate inputs trivial for gaussian processes and log linear functions as the size of the input space grows with increasing dimensions more data are needed to accurately model the extremal processes especially for the models of maxima this will increase the posterior dimensionality future work is ongoing to extend the methodology presented to model vessel response as a function of significant wave height peak wave period and incident wave direction 7 4 alternate method for modelling threshold exceedance data in our industrial experience often we do not have access to the full time domain simulation output historical or otherwise rather simulation runs are recorded by their statistical summaries where this is the case estimates of threshold exceedance may still be provided from knowledge of the quantiles and the maxima as is shown in section 4 1 2 ξ y and σ may be obtained from the gev parameter estimates of ξ z σ μ the threshold values u are obtained from the results of the quantile regression given by u q ˆ α as all required parameters are theoretically known functions of existing parameter estimates prediction of the quantile exceedance data requires no further probabilistic parameter quantification the predictive posterior distribution of y at an input x may thus be expressed as 14 p y z p y q ˆ α x μ x β z ξ z p q ˆ α x q α x ϕ ρ 2 p μ x μ θ p μ β z ξ z θ ϕ ρ 2 z d μ d β z d ξ z d θ d ϕ d ρ 2 where y q ˆ α x μ x β z ξ z genp u x σ x ξ z ϕ θ β z ρ 2 μ as an example diagnostic results of this model for roll are seen in fig 9 the model retains good predictive performance as seen in the coverage plot however the qq density plot indicates that there is far more uncertainty in the parameter estimates this is to be expected as there is far less data available to the model as only the 60 maximum values are utilised as opposed to the 32 400 exceedance points used in section 6 4 where possible we recommend the use of the method presented in section 5 1 3 as more data are available for accurate modelling however should historical simulator runs only be recorded by the statistical summaries this alternate method is a possibility 8 conclusion extremal data from a time domain simulation of fpso vessel motions is modelled as a function of the peak wave period the incorporation of covariate effects to the extremal modelling of dynamic structures is novel to offshore engineering frameworks for the fast and accurate analysis of time domain maxima quantiles and quantile exceedance data are provided two diagnostics are introduced to assess the maxima and threshold exceedance models coverage plots and qq density plots analysis of the diagnostics suggest that the developed models and assumptions are satisfactory a speed increase of 15 000 times is seen when comparing the developed models to the original simulator enabling the use of the techniques demonstrated herein for operational decision making understanding each type of extremal output with uncertainty contributes to forming a complete picture of the predicted extremal behaviour of the vessel it is demonstrated that latent variable modelling combined with quantile regression offers an accurate and efficient technique to quantify non stationary extremal responses subject to covariate effects the methods shown are generalisable and applicable to a wide range of offshore engineering problems acknowledgements this research was supported by the arc industrial transformation

22821,this paper presents a semi analytical high order translating and pulsating green s function method for the hydrodynamic calculations of ships advancing in waves in this method the boundary integral equation bie for the radiation and diffraction problems is discretized by using 9 node bi quadratic curvilinear elements the translating pulsating green s function used in the bie is decomposed into rankine source g s and froude dependent component g f for the panel integrals related to rankine source the element geometry and velocity potential are described by the same interpolation functions and the traditional gauss quadrature is employed to calculate the influence coefficients but when it comes to the froude dependent component which is highly oscillatory in the horizontal direction we take a different integral strategy the 9 node element is divided into four quadrilateral elements and a semi analytical scheme is established to calculate the integral over each quadrilateral element in this scheme an analytical expression is derived for the integral along the horizontal direction while gauss quadrature is used for the integral computation along the vertical direction based on the semi analytical method the integrals of g f and its x derivative over a unit square are calculated numerical results show that present method is of good convergence and accuracy as compared with other existing results then this semi analytical high order method is applied to solve the forward speed ship motions in waves the hydrodynamic coefficients wave exciting forces and motion responses of a mathematical ship model modified wigley hull are first calculated the computed results are compared with the experimental data and other numerical results of constant panel method cpm and traditional high order boundary method hobem based on gauss quadrature numerical results show that the present semi analytical high order method appears to be more stable than the

decades it is well known that the boundary element panel method based on potential flow theory is a practical and efficient numerical tool to predict them according to the green s function employed in the boundary integral equation the panel methods can usually be divided into two categories rankine source method and free surface green s function method since the pioneering work of hess and smith 1964 the rankine source approach has been widely used in the ship wave problems dawson 1977 peng et al 2014 and seakeeping problems bertram and thiart 1998 zhang et al 2010 the originally proposed rankine source approach is a kind of constant panel method it requires a large number of panels to describe the surface geometry and is hard to obtain desired accuracy of derivatives on the surface to reduce the computational cost and improve the accuracy some researchers combined the rankine source approach with the higher order boundary element discretization for instance kouh and suen 2001 kring et al 2004 and gao and zou 2008 employed non uniform rational b spline nurbs to describe the body geometry shao and faltinsen 2012 he and kashiwagi 2014 and chen et al 2018 used biquadratic isoparametric panels to discretize the body surface generally the higher order rankine source codes developed by them are successfully applied in the ship hydrodynamic problems the major advantage of rankine source method is that it allows for more flexibility in treatment of the free surface condition this implies that for unsteady free surface flow problem more complicated free surface conditions instead of simple uniform flow or neumann kelvin linearization can be considered in the calculations yasukawa 1990 kim and kim 2010 zhang et al 2010 and yasuda et al 2016 considered double body flow as the basis flow to linearize the free surface boundary condition kring 1994 proposed a generalized linear free surface condition containing both uniform flow and double body flow linearizations as subsets and developed a time domain rankine code called aegir kring et al 2004 peltzer et al 2008 to solve the three dimensional potential flow around a ship after continued development aegir is now able to simulate the response of high speed ships rosenthal et al 2013 and solve both linear and nonlinear seakeeping problems o reilly et al 2018 however there are some inherent limitations in the rankine source method 1 the integration regions in the bie include not only the ship hull but also the free surface which will increase the calculation burden and introduce the numerical dissipation and instability 2 the radiation condition ahead of the ship is hard to be satisfied especially for the brard number τ less than 0 25 bertram 2012 in which case the calculation accuracy is often very poor on the other hand the free surface green s function method can avoid these limitations in this method the green s function that automatically satisfies the free surface and radiation conditions is employed in the bie so the singularities are only needed to be distributed on the wetted body surface the main work of this paper is to establish a semi analytical high order free surface green s function method to obtain more stable and accurate numerical solutions of the seakeeping problems with forward speed as early as 1946 haskind 1946 derived the double fourier integral form of translating pulsating green s function but this original form is complex and not suitable for computation for the convenience of calculation some single integral forms such as bessho form bessho 1977 iwashita and ohkusu 1989 du et al 2000 and havelock form havelock 1958 zong and huang 1991 were derived later the translating pulsating green s function is highly oscillatory chen 2000 especially for the filed point approaches the source point near the free surface consequently it will be difficult to obtain a stable and accurate integral value of the green s function over a panel in view of this some efforts were devoted to developing an analytical or semi analytical expression of the panel integral of the green s function for example iwashita 1992 and maury et al 2003 proposed an analytical quadrature of bessho s single integral expression over a panel and hong et al 2016 of our team developed a semi analytical havelock form green s function distributing on a horizontal line segment these analytical and semi analytical expressions have been proved to be more accurate than the traditional numerical quadrature and are able to decrease the oscillations of the calculations recent work on the translating pulsating green s function in both numerical and analytical aspects enables us today to solve the forward speed seakeeping problems by the free surface green s function method but most of the implementations of this method were low order schemes as mentioned above the high order schemes have been successfully used in the rankine source method there are also some published papers about the high order zero speed green s function methods liu et al 1991 teng and taylor 1995 choi et al 2001 but when it comes to the forward speed green s function most of the existing seakeeping codes are low order schemes the main reason for this may be that the translating pulsating green s function is difficult to compute and the corresponding high order algorithm will be very complicated besides in the high order boundary element method the collocation points are located at the nodes of the elements rather than the panel centers liu et al 1991 so the top collocation points of a surface piercing ship are at the free surface which will increase the oscillations of the green s function and consequently make it hard to obtain a stable numerical solution to circumvent these difficulties a new semi analytical high order translating pulsating green s function method is developed we employ 9 node bi quadratic curvilinear elements to discretize the hull surface then the discrete form of bie can be obtained the translating pulsating green s function used in the bie is expressed as the sum of rankine source g s and froude dependent component g f which is highly oscillatory for the panel integrals related to g s the element geometry and velocity potential are described by the same interpolation functions and the traditional gauss quadrature is employed to calculate the influence coefficients but when it comes to g f a completely different integral strategy is adopted we first divide the 9 node element into four quadrilateral elements and in each quadrilateral element a local right handed cartesian coordinate system o ξ η ζ with the ξ o η plane on the element and ξ axis parallel to the mean free surface is defined then the panel integrals in global coordinate system are transformed to the integrals in ξ o η plane in view that g f is highly oscillatory along the horizontal direction but smooth along the vertical direction hong el al different approaches are taken to integrate with respect to ξ and η an analytical expression is derived for the horizontal segment integral with respect to ξ while traditional gauss quadrature is adopted to integrate with respect to η so the so called semi analytical panel integral expressions related to g f and its partial derivatives can be obtained before the numerical implementation singularities in the integrands are analyzed systematically and by performing variable substitution and using the lobatto rule zong and huang 1991 we eliminate the singularity at the critical point θ υ after that the integrals related to g f over the quadrilateral elements can be calculated approximately by adaptive integral method the convergence and accuracy of the present semi analytical high order expression is investigated by the integrals of g f and its x derivative over a unit square we apply this semi analytical high order method to the hydrodynamic calculations of ships with forward speed the hydrodynamic coefficients wave exciting forces and motion responses of a mathematical ship model modified wigley hull advancing at fn 0 2 are first calculated for comparison the experimental data and other numerical results of the cpm and traditional hobem based on numerical quadrature are also shown in this paper wonderful agreement is found between the present results and the experimental data besides the present semi analytical high order method appears to be more stable than the traditional hobem and more accurate than the cpm then numerical simulations are conducted on a navy surface combatant model dtmb 5512 and a full formed ship modified kvlcc2 wave induced heave and pitch motions are calculated and analyzed the present semi analytical hobem is proved to be able to produce satisfactory predictions for the practical ships 2 mathematical model and numerical implementation a right handed inertial reference frame o xyz translating with the mean speed u of the ship is introduced as shown in fig 1 the x axis is taken positive in the direction of the forward speed the z axis points upward and crosses the gravity center of the ship and the origin is located on the undisturbed free surface the incident wave angle β is defined as the angle between the positive x axis and the wave propagation direction the incident wave frequency and wavenumber are denoted as ω 0 and k respectively and a dispersion relationship ω 0 2 g k is found between them for water of infinite depth in the moving reference coordinate system o xyz the incident wave comes with the encounter frequency ω e ω 0 kucosβ 2 1 velocity potential and boundary integral equation the velocity potential φ is introduced to describe the fluid motion under the assumption of ideal and incompressible fluid with irrotational motion within the framework of linear frequency domain potential flow theory the total velocity potential φ can be decomposed as follows 1 φ x y z t ϕ x y z re ϕ i x y z ϕ d x y z ϕ r x y z e i ω e t where ϕ denotes the velocity potential due to the steady motion of the ship ϕ i ϕ d and ϕ r are spatial parts of the incident wave diffraction and radiation potentials respectively by the linear decomposition ϕ r can be further written as ϕ r x y z j 1 6 i ω e x j ϕ j where x j is the complex amplitude of the ship motion in the j th mode and ϕ j is the corresponding normalized radiation potential the key point of the seakeeping problem is the solution of the diffraction potential ϕ d and the radiation potential ϕ j which satisfy the well known laplace s equation and boundary conditions the present study makes use of the direct boundary element method using the translating pulsating green s function g p q to solve this boundary value problem according to the green s third identity the unsteady velocity potential can be obtained by the following boundary integral equation 2 c p φ p 1 4 π s b g p q φ q n q φ q g p q n q d s q 1 4 π g w l 2 u i ω e φ g u 2 φ g ξ g φ ξ d η where φ represents ϕ d or ϕ j p x y z and q ξ η ζ are field point and source point respectively c p is the spatial solid angle at the field point p s b denotes the mean wetted body surface wl is the interaction curve between the body surface and the undisturbed free surface the translating pulsating source green s function g p q can be expressed as 3 g g s g f where g s is defined in terms of distribution of rankine singularities and g f is the froude dependent part of the green s function specially g s is defined as 4 g s 1 r 1 r 1 where r x ξ 2 y η 2 z ζ 2 r 1 x ξ 2 y η 2 z ζ 2 in this paper the froude dependent part g f in havelock form is employed due to its explicit physical meaning and relative ease of calculation according to zong and huang 1991 the froude dependent part g f in eq 3 can be written as 5 g f m n 1 2 0 π 1 m 1 k m e k m α n e 1 k m α n 2 π i h m n π 1 4 τ cos θ d θ where α n z ζ i x ξ cos θ 1 n 1 y η sin θ τ u ω e g k m 1 2 τ cos θ

the hobem the bie eq 2 is discretized with 9 node bi quadratic curvilinear elements shown in fig 2 a according to the decomposition of the green s function in eq 3 the integrals over each 9 node element on the right side of eq 2 can be written as 6 i 1 δ s g φ n q d s q δ s g s g f φ n q d s q i 1 s i 1 f i 2 δ s φ g n q d s q δ s φ g s n q g f n q d s q i 2 s i 2 f where i 1 s and i 2 s denote the integrals related to g s and its derivative respectively i 1 f and i 2 f denote the integrals related to g f and its derivative respectively if we use θ to signify the physical or geometrical variables it can be expressed on each element as 7 θ k 1 9 n k s t θ k where θ k represent the variable value at the k th node of the element n k is the shape function associated with the node k whose expression can be found in the reference chen et al 2016 based on the isoparametric transformation the 3d curvilinear elements will be mapped into a 2d parametric plane s t fig 2 b and c illustrate the mapped image and shape functions of the 9 node element respectively substituting eq 7 into the expressions of i 1 s and i 2 s in eq 6 we can obtain 8 i 1 s δ s g s φ n q d s q k 1 9 φ k n q 1 1 1 1 g s n k s t j s t d s d t i 2 s δ s φ g s n q d s q k 1 9 φ k 1 1 1 1 g s n q n k s t j s t d s d t where j s t is jacobian determinant by distributing several gauss points on the standard square element the influence coefficients of related to g s and its derivative can be calculated easily similarly the panel integrals i 1 f and i 2 f in eq 6 which are related to g f and its derivative can also be calculated by the same gauss quadrature used in i 1 s and i 2 s but as we know the froude dependent part g f and its partial derivatives are highly oscillatory along the horizontal direction see fig 3 so if the number of the gauss points distributed in the horizontal direction is not enough considerable errors will be introduced to the numerical calculation of the panel integrals to reduce the integral error semi analytical high order expressions are derived to calculate the panel integrals i 1 f and i 2 f in the following 3 semi analytical high order panel integrals related to g f before deriving the semi analytical high order expressions of i 1 f and i 2 f we first divide the 9 node element into four quadrilateral elements then the integral over the 9 node element can be expressed as the summation of the four panel integrals over the quadrilateral elements 9 i 1 f δ s g f φ n q d s q e 1 4 δ s e g f φ n q d s q i 2 f δ s φ g f n q d s q e 1 4 δ s e φ g f n q d s q where e represent the number of the quadrilateral element 3 1 local coordinate system in each quadrilateral element a local right handed coordinate system o ξ η ζ with the origin at the center is defined as shown in fig 4 the ξ o η plane is on the element and the ξ axis is parallel to the mean free surface the transformation between local coordinate and global coordinate can be written as 10 ξ ξ 0 d 1 ξ d 2 η η η 0 e 1 ξ e 2 η ζ ζ 0 f 1 ξ f 2 η where ξ 0 η 0 ζ 0 is the global coordinate of the quadrilateral element center ξ η ζ and ξ η ζ denote the local coordinate and global coordinate of a point in the quadrilateral element respectively the coefficients d 1 d 2 e 1 e 2 f 1 and f 2 on the right side of the equations are relevant to the angles between the two coordinate systems 11 d 1 cos α x d 2 cos β x e 1 cos α y e 2 cos β y f 1 cos α z 0 f 2 cos β z where α x α y and α z denote the angle between ξ axis and x axis the angle between ξ axis and y axis and the angle between ξ axis and z axis respectively β x β y and β z denote the angle between η axis and x axis the angle between η axis and y axis and the angle between η axis and z axis respectively 3 2 semi analytical expressions of panel integrals in local coordinate system according to the concept of piecewise polynomial approximation in finite element method larson and bengzon 2013 the physical variable θ at any point of the 4 node quadrilateral element can be expressed as 12 θ β 1 β 2 ξ β 3 η β 4 ξ η where β i i 1 2 3 4 are undetermined parameters substituting the node coordinates and nodal values θ i into eq 12 a system of linear equations about β i will be formed by employing cramer s rule we can obtain the solutions of this linear equations 13 β 1 1 d i 1 4 a i θ i β 2 1 d i 1 4 b i θ

different strategies to integrate with respect to ξ and η i e analytical expressions are derived for the horizontal segment integrals with respect to ξ and gauss legendre quadrature is employed to evaluate the integrals with respect to η the semi analytical expressions of the panel integrals over the quadrilateral element can be obtained 14 i 1 4 n o d e f δ s e g f φ n q d s q 1 d k 1 4 i 1 n

appendix 3 3 analysis of singularity the analytical expressions of the horizontal segment integrals eq 15 18 are θ type single integrals it can be found that the integrands of these integrals are singularity functions in this section the singularities of the integrands will be analyzed systematically 3 3 1 discontinuity points in the integral line segment in the derivation of the analytical horizontal segment integrals the integrands are assumed to be continuous with respect to ξ but in practice the integrands may be discontinuous for a given horizontal segment as they include the complex exponential integral e 1 k m α n and heaviside step function h mn as we know e 1 u is a multi valued function at the negative real axis zong and huang 1991 so the root of imag k m α n 0 is a discontinuous point of the integrands substituting the expressions of k m and α n into imag k m α n 0 we can obtain the discontinuity point of e 1 u 19 θ 0 υ ξ singular 1 2 τ c o s θ x ξ 0 d 2 η c o s

θ 1 n 1 e 1 s i n θ the step function h mn is a discontinuous function according to the expressions in the reference xu and dong 2011 if θ 0 υ where υ is equal to arccos 1 4 τ for τ 0 25 and 0 for τ 0 25 the possible discontinuity points of h mn exists at re k m α n 0 imag k m α n 0 and imag α n 0 but when θ υ π h mn has the only discontinuity point at imag α n 0 by solving these equations the discontinuity points of h mn can be expressed as 21 θ 0 υ ξ singular 1 m 4 τ c o s θ 1 x ξ 0 d 2 η c o s θ 1 n 1 y η 0 e 2 η s i n θ 1 2 τ c o s θ z ζ 0 f 2 η 1 2 τ c o s θ f 1 1 m 4 τ c o s θ 1 d 1 c

the discontinuity points of e 1 k m α n and h mn for a given θ so to ensure the continuity of the integrands we need only to divide the integral segment ξ l ξ r into several subsections by these discontinuity points 3 3 2 singular terms related to k m the wave numbers k 1 and k 2 are associated with the ring wave generated by the pulsating source and the kelvin steady wave generated by the translating source respectively they are important parameters of the integrands of the horizontal segment integrals the typical far field wave patterns corresponding to k 1 under the condition u 0 ω e 0 and k 2 under the condition u 0 ω e 0 are illustrated in the two figures of fig 6 according to the expressions of k m their values are dependent on θ if θ π 2 the denominators of k m will be equal to zero so θ π 2 is the singular point of k m when θ π 2 the limits of k 1 and k 2 are 23 lim θ π 2 k m lim θ π 2 1 2 τ cos θ 1 m 1 4 τ cos θ cos 2 θ g 2 u 2 ω e 2 g m 1 m 2 the results in eq 23 indicate that θ π 2 is a removable discontinuity point of k 1 so if we define k 1 ω 2 g at θ π 2 and calculate k 1 by the formula 24 the singularity of k 1 can be eliminated 24 k 1 4 ω 2 g 1 1 4 τ cos θ 2 however due to k 2 as θ π 2 the computation of k 2 is different from k 1 according to eq 15 18 there are five terms 1 k 2 e k 2 α n k 2 e k 2 α n e k 2 α n e 1 k 2 α n e k 2 α n e 1 k 2 α n k 2 or their combinations related to k 2 in the analytical expressions of the horizontal segment integrals the first term will not cause numerical integral difficulties since 1 k 2 0 as θ π 2 the second and third terms can be written as e k 2 z ζ e i k 2 x ξ cos θ 1 n 1 y η sin θ and k 2 e k 2 z ζ e i k 2 x ξ cos θ 1 n 1 y η sin θ they are oscillatory functions with the amplitudes e k 2 z ζ and k 2 e k 2 z ζ respectively when θ π 2 k 2 will tend to positive infinity and consequently the exponent k 2 z ζ of e k 2 z ζ and k 2 e k 2 z ζ will tend to negative infinity since the field point and source point are both below the free surface i e z ζ 0 in the practical calculation so e k 2 z ζ will tend to zero as θ π 2 and for k 2 e k 2 z ζ the same conclusion can be obtained by using series expansion 25 lim k 2 k 2 e k 2 z ζ lim k 2 k 2 e k 2 z ζ lim k 2 k 2 n 0 k 2 z ζ n n 0 the last two terms related to k 2 can be written as e u e 1 u and e u e 1 u u with u k 2 α n the independent variable u is equal to k 2 α n k 2 z ζ i k 2 x ξ cos θ 1 n 1 y η sin θ since both the field point and source point are below the free surface the real part of u will be less than zero in view of this we calculate the values of e u e 1 u and e u e 1 u u for re u 0 and the typical function images are plotted in fig 7 according to the two figures shown in fig 7 we can see that if the real part of u is less than zero the limits of e u e 1 u and e u e 1 u u are 0 and 1 as imag u or that is to say e k 2 α n e 1 k 2 α n and e k 2 α n e 1 k 2 α n k 2 will tend to be the constants as k 2 and the relative terms in the integrands of the horizontal segment integrals will tend to zero as θ π 2 through the above analysis and mathematical treatment the singularity of k m can be eliminated and no difficulties will be introduced into the integral calculation 3 3 3 singularity of cτ and cn when the brard number τ is larger than 0 25 the denominator of c τ will be equal to zero at θ υ arccos 1 4 τ under this circumstances it will be difficult to obtain accurate results of the horizontal segment integrals eq 15 18 here we take the integral i g f l i eq 15 on a horizontal line segment from 0 433 0 25 0 2 to 0 433 0 25 0 2 for a field point at 0 0 0 as an example for τ 0 26 the integrand of i g f l i with different θ are calculated and plotted in fig 8 a and the coefficient c τ in the integrand is plotted in fig 8 b by comparing the results shown in the two figures of fig 8 we find that the integrand of i g f l i are discontinuous at the singular point of c τ i e θ υ and in the vicinity of θ υ the value of the integrand is much larger than that at other positions so we must take some measures to deal with the discontinuity of the integrand at θ υ to obtain a more accurate integral value according to the expressions of eq 15 18 a new coefficient c n is introduced into the integrands f m n θ f m n ξ θ f m n θ and f m n ξ θ the integrands will be discontinuous at the zero point θ 0 of the denominator of c n i e f 1 i d 1 cos θ 1 n 1 e 1 sin θ but by using the l hospital s rule we can prove that θ 0 is a removable discontinuity of the integrands the limits of f m n θ and f m n θ at θ 0 can be expressed as 26 lim θ θ 0 f m n θ e 1 k m α n e k m α n k m ξ r ξ l 2 π i h m n e k m α n k m ξ r ξ l 27 lim θ θ 0 f m n θ e 1 k m α n e k m α n k m 2 ξ r ξ l 2 π i h m n e k m α n k m 2 ξ r ξ l k m α n ξ r ξ l similarly we can also obtain the limits of f m n ξ θ and f m n ξ θ which is not presented in this paper since their expressions are too complex so if the values of the integrands at θ 0 are supplementally defined the singularity can be eliminated besides another alternative way to eliminate the singularity is via extrapolation in a neighborhood of θ 0 3 4 numerical implementation after the above analysis and treatment we find that the main difficulty in the calculation of the horizontal segment integrals lies in the treatment of the singularity at θ υ see fig 8 in order to eliminate the singularity we divide the integral interval 0 π into 0 ν ν π by performing t cos θ the horizontal segment integrals 15 18 can be converted into some special forms if τ is larger than 0 25 another expression of i g f l i eq 15 can be derived as follows 28 i g f l i l i g f d ξ m n 1 2 0 π 1 m 1 c τ f m n θ d θ m n 1 2 0 π 1 m 1 π 1 4 τ cos θ f m n θ d θ m n 1 2 0 ν ν π

arccos t π 4 τ 1 t d t θ ν π where μ cos ν if τ 0 25 υ will be equal to zero in this case the integrands have no singularity at θ υ and there is no real need to take some special treatment for them but for ease of programing a similar expression as eq 28 is derived for τ 0 25 29 i g f l i m n 1 2 1 1 1 μ t t 1 1 m 1 f m n arccos t π 1 4 τ t d t the uniform expression of 28 and 29 can be written as 30 i g f l i m n 1 2 μ 1 g m n t 1 t t μ d t 1 μ h m n t μ t t 1 d t where g m n t 1 m 1 μ t g t f m n arccos t h m n t 1 m 1 μ t h t f m n arccos t μ t g t 1 i π 4 τ 1 t τ 0 25 0 τ 0 25 μ t h t 1

according to the lobatto rule zong and huang 1991 the integral of this form can be transformed into 0 π f b a 2 b a 2 cos χ d χ by performing u b a 2 b a 2 cos χ which eliminates the singularity at the end points so we can rewrite formulas 30 33 as 34 i g f l i m n 1 2 0 π g m n γ 1 χ h m n γ 2 χ d χ 35 i ξ g f l i m n 1 2 0 π g m n ξ γ 1 χ h m n ξ γ 2 χ d χ 36 i g x f l i i g y f l i i g z f l

and applying adaptive integral method in which the local integration interval length varies with the oscillations of the integrand in each subinterval the horizontal segment integrals can be calculated approximately then substituting the values of segment integrals into eq 14 we can obtain the panel integrals over the quadrilateral element 3 5 convergence and accuracy of the semi analytical method the panel integrals of g f and its partial derivatives over a unit square with its center at 0 0 0 51 and normal vector along the y axis maury et al 2003 are adopted to validate the present high order semi analytical integral method the forward speed and non dimensional encounter frequency are fn 0 1 and ϖ e 2 where ϖ e ω e l g respectively fig 9 a and b plot the typical function distribution of the real parts of g f and its x derivative on the unit square for a field point at the origin drastic oscillations are observed in x axis direction especially for the source points approaches to the free surface while g f and g x f change smoothly along z axis to calculate the panel integrals of g f and g x f by the present high order semi analytical method we need to set the velocity potential φ and its normal derivative φ n q in eq 14 equal to unit one as mentioned above in the semi analytical method the unit square is discretized into a series of segments parallel to x axis on which the integrals are calculated analytically numerical results with different numbers of segments for a field point at the origin are illustrated in fig 10 the abscissa n s in the two figures of fig 10 represents the number of the segments distributed on the unit square it can be seen that both the integrals of g f and g x f will stop changing if the number of the segments is more than 10 which indicates that the present method is of good convergence for comparison the same panel integrals calculated by the traditional gauss method are plotted in fig 11 the number of gauss points distributed along the z axis direction is set equal to 10 since the results in fig 10 show that ten horizontal segments are enough for the calculation of the panel integrals the abscissa of fig 11 is the number of gauss points in x axis direction different from the semi analytical method drastic oscillations are observed in the results of the numerical quadrature the numerical results especially the integral of the x derivative of g f are hard to reach the convergence precision even large numbers of gauss points are distributed in the x axis direction comparisons between the results plotted in figs 10 and 11 indicate that the present high order semi analytical panel integral method is easier to get convergence and stabilization than the traditional gauss quadrature based on the present high order semi analytical method the panel integrals of g f and g x f for a field point describing the z axis are calculated and plotted in fig 12 the calculation condition is described at the beginning of the section and 10 segments are used to discretize the unit square for comparison the accurate results of hong et al 2016 are also illustrated in these figures the excellent agreement between the present results and the existing results indicates that the high order semi analytical method established in this paper has a high accuracy 4 hydrodynamic calculations after calculating the panel integrals related to g s and g f a discrete form of bie can be constructed by substituting 8 9 and 14 into eq 2 then the velocity potential at each node of the 9 node elements can be obtained by solving this discrete bie 4 1 hydrodynamic coefficients and wave exciting forces substituting unsteady velocity potential into the bernoulli s equation newman 1979 the dynamic pressure distribution on the body surface can be computed the unsteady force acting on the ship can be expressed as the integral of the dynamic pressure over the body surface in this paper the unsteady force is divided into the incident wave force diffraction force and radiation force in corresponding to the decomposition of the unsteady potential in eq 1 the sum of incident wave force and diffraction force is called wave exciting force the complex amplitude of the wave exciting force in the i th direction can be expressed as 38 f i w ρ s b i ω e ϕ i ϕ d u ϕ i ϕ d x n i d s the radiation force due to the six degree of freedom motion can be calculated by 39 f i r j 1 6 ρ ω e 2 x j s b ϕ j i u ω e ϕ j x n i d s j 1 6 ω e 2 x j μ i j i ω e λ i j where μ i j and λ i j are added mass and damping coefficients respectively a modified wigley hull is first adopted to validate the present semi analytical high order translating and pulsating green s function method in the calculation of the hydrodynamic coefficients and wave exciting forces the length breadth and draft of the modified wigley hull are 2 m 0 3 m and 0 125 m respectively experimental data about it can be obtained in the references he and kashiwagi 2014 kashiwagi 2013 fig 13 shows the sketch of the mesh used in the calculation where 96 nine node elements are employed to discretize the body surface the case of fn 0 2 is considered in the present study besides the present semi analytical high order method the cpm hong et al 2013 and traditional hobem based on the gauss quadrature are also used in the calculation for comparison the number of the panels used in the cpm is 450 and the same mesh for the present semi analytical hobem see fig 13 is used in the calculation of the traditional hobem fig 14 illustrate the numerical and experimental results of added mass and damping coefficients due to the forced oscillations in heave and pitch it can be seen that the computed results from the present semi analytical hobem and cpm agree well with the experimental data on the whole in the low frequency region the present results are more close to experimental data than that from cpm especially for the heave coefficients i e μ 33 λ 33 different from the above two methods oscillating phenomenon is observed in the hydrodynamic coefficients curves of the traditional hobem the reason for this oscillation can mainly be considered as follows in the hobem the collocation points are chosen at the elements nodes rather than centers so the top field points are in the free surface which will intensify the oscillation of the green s function along the horizontal direction when gauss quadrature is employed to estimate the panel integrals related to the green s function it is hard to obtain stable and accurate results see fig 11 but by using the present semi analytical scheme the oscillations can be decreased then the wave exciting forces acting on the modified wigley hull advancing at fn 0 2 in head wave are calculated non dimensional results of the surge heave and pitch forces are plotted in the three figures of fig 15 respectively it is found that the computed results of the present semi analytical hobem are smooth and show excellent agreement with the experimental data in the whole wavelength range the cpm will underestimate the surge exciting force in the long wave region although good coincidence can be obtained between the experimental and computed results for both heave and pitch forces when it comes to the traditional hobem based on gauss quadrature the similar oscillatory phenomenon as the hydrodynamic coefficients is also observed in the wave exciting forces all of the above numerical calculations are performed on a personal computer with intel i7 4790 cpu of 3 4 ghz the openmp parallel technique chandra et al 2001 is employed to accelerate the computation if 8 threads are used the average consumed time of the cpm traditional hobem and present semi analytical hobem for one frequency are 58 9s 64 3s and 51 6s respectively overall there is no significant difference in the time costs of the three methods the computational efficiency of present semi analytical hobem can meet the need of engineering application since only about 1 min is comsumed for one frequency as stated above we can conclude that the present semi analytical hobem works well in predicting the hydrodynamic coefficients and wave exciting forces of ships advancing in waves besides compared with the cpm and traditional hobem based gauss quadrature the present method is more accurate and stable 4 2 wave induced motions after obtaining the hydrodynamic coefficients and wave exciting forces the wave induced motions of the ships with forward speed can be calculated by solving the motion equation in frequency domain 40 j 1 6 ω e 2 m i j μ i j i ω e λ i j c i j x j f i w i 1 2 6 where m i j and c i j are generalized mass and hydrostatic restoring force coefficient respectively 4 2 1 motions of modified wigley numerical and experimental results of wave induced motions in surge heave and pitch of modified wigley advancing in head wave with the forward speed fn 0 2 are plotted in fig 16 good agreement is found between the present numerical results and the experimental data for the vertical i e heave and pitch motions dominated by hydrostatics and inertia rather than the wave body disturbance the results of the cpm do not show a significant difference with that of the present semi analytical high order method but when it comes to the wave induced motion in surge the cpm obviously underestimates the peak value near λ l 1 0 and overestimate the value in the long wave range this is probably induced by the inaccurate calculation of the wave exciting forces in surge see fig 15 as for motion responses obtained from the traditional hobem based on gauss quadrature due to the oscillation in the hydrodynamic coefficients and wave exciting forces see figs 14 and 15 they show strong instability near the peak value frequency 4 2 2 motions of dtmb 5512 with different forward speed the above results show that the present semi analytical hobem can works well in the hydrodynamic calculation of the mathematical ship model in this section a david taylor model basin dtmb model 5512 is selected to verify the applicability of the present method in practical ship models dtmb 5512 is a 1 46 6 scale model of a navy surface combatant with the length l 3 048 m the principle dimensions of the ship model is shown in table 1 a series of experiments about the wave induced motions of dtmb 5512 in head waves have been conducted by irvine et al 2008 different speeds are chosen for the present investigation the panel distribution of dtmb 5512 is illustrated in fig 17 in which the mean wetted surface is discretized by 160 nine node elements heave and pitch motions of dtmb 5512 are calculated for speeds corresponding to fn 0 19 0 28 and 0 41 over a wide frequency range comparison between the numerical and experimental results is shown in fig 18 it can be seen that the computed heave and pitch motions show good agreement with those of the experimental data especially for the low speed case fn 0 19 both the experimental data and present numerical results display a dependence on the forward speed of the ship the peak values of the heave and pitch motions are found to increase with the increase of the forward speed while the corresponding resonant frequencies are on the contrary on the other hand numerical results of present semi analytical high order method are slightly larger than the experimental data near the resonant frequencies there are many possible reasons for this discrepancy one possible reason is that the free surface condition is linearized by uniform stream which will induce errors near the resonant frequencies for high speed cases another reason may be that nonlinear or viscous effects are neglected in present model nonlinear or viscous effects may not be significant for wave induced motions with low speed but when the speed goes high their effects should not be ignored especially near the resonant frequencies however the present semi analytical hobem can produce satisfactory predictions for all speeds considered on the whole further study for achieving more accurate values near the resonant frequencies is still on the way to see whether the present method still shows advantages over the cpm and traditional hobem in the hydrodynamic calculations of dtmb 5512 we conduct a comparison research on the motion responses obtained from these three methods fig 19 shows the heave and pitch motions of dtmb 5512 at fn 0 28 calculated by different methods 640 panels are used in the calculation of cpm while the same 9 node mesh for the present method see fig 17 are employed in the traditional hobem it can be obviously observed that both the results of the cpm and traditional hobem are more oscillatory than those of present semi analytical hobem this is probably because of the flare in the stern see fig 17 where even the collocation field points of the cpm which are at the panel centers are very close to the free surface in this case the translating pulsating green s function is highly oscillatory chen 2000 and it is difficult to use the gauss quadrature to obtain stable panel integrals related to it consequently unstable results of motion responses are obtained by the cpm and traditional hobem based on gauss quadrature 4 2 3 motions of modified kvlcc2 with block coefficient cb 0 84 finally motion responses for a more full formed ship modified kvlcc2 with block coefficient cb 0 84 are investigated by present semi analytical hobem the length breadth and draft of this ship are lpp 320 m b 58 m and t 20 8 m respectively its body plan is shown in yasukawa et al 2018 and its 3d geometry model can be seen in fig 20 which is discretized by 216 nine node panels just like the above two cases motions of the modified kvlcc2 are also calculated by the cpm and traditional hobem based on gauss quadrature for comparison 840 panels are employed in the calculation of the cpm and panel distribution shown in fig 20 are used in calculation of the traditional hobem and present semi analytical hobem fig 21 shows the computed and measured vertical motions of the modified kvlcc2 at fn 0 166 in head waves it can be seen that the traditional hobem does not give stable predictions of the motions as the other two methods which is similar to the calculations in modified wigley and dtmb 5512 overall motion responses obtained from the cpm and present semi analytical hobem have the similar tendency with the experimental data but near the peak value frequency although results of present method appear to be more close to the experimental data both of the cpm and present semi analytical hobem will over predict the motion responses this is possibly because the steady flow or nonlinear effects cannot be considered in the translating pulsating green s function method as mentioned above 5 conclusions in this paper a semi analytical high order boundary element method based on translating pulsating source green s function is developed for the ship hydrodynamic problems in comparison to other classic boundary element methods such as approximate forward speed method afs rankine source methods including neumann kelvin method double body method and nonlinear method et al bunnik et al 2010 hirdaris et al 2014 kalske and manderbacka 2017 the translating pulsating green s function method can be applied to higher froude numbers and does not need to distribute singularities over the free surface but it is challenging to evaluate the panel integrals related to the green s function the main motivation behind this work is to improve the accuracy and stability of this translating pulsating source method used to predict the wave induced loads and motions of marine vessels with forward speed within the framework of linear potential theory a boundary integral equation is formulated for the hydrodynamic problem in order to solve the bie the body surface is discretized into a series of nine node bi quadratic curvilinear elements the major difficulty in this method is the evaluation of the panel integrals associated with the green s function the forward speed green s function used in the bie is composed of rankine source and froude dependent component different integral strategies are employed to calculate the influence coefficients related to the two components for the rankine source part the element geometry and velocity potential are described by the same interpolation functions and the traditional gauss quadrature is employed to calculate the influence coefficients due to the highly oscillatory properties along the horizontal direction of the froude dependent component a semi analytical scheme is derived for the corresponding integral computation in the derivation we first divide the 9 node element into four 4 node quadrilateral elements so the integral over the 9 node element can be expressed by the summation of the integrals over the four quadrilateral elements then in each quadrilateral element an analytical expression is derived for the integral along the horizontal direction while the integral along the other direction is still calculated by the gauss quadrature the singularities of the semi analytical expression are analyzed and eliminated by performing variable substitution and using the lobatto rule in the numerical implementation the adaptive integral method is adopted to calculate the analytical integral expression along the horizontal direction the convergence and accuracy of the semi analytical scheme is validated by the integrals of g f and its x derivative over a unit square wonderful agreement is found between the present results and other available numerical results in the special case when the field point is in the free surface present semi analytical method can obtain a convergent integral value by distributing several horizontal segments on the square however even if a large number of gauss points is distributed on the square it is hard to use the gauss quadrature to obtain a stable value a computer code based on the semi analytical high order method is developed for the hydrodynamic calculations this code is first applied to solve the radiation and diffraction problems of a modified wigley hull with the forward speed fn 0 2 it is found that the hydrodynamic coefficients and wave exciting forces calculated by the present method agree well with the experimental data and compared with the traditional hobem based on gauss

22821,this paper presents a semi analytical high order translating and pulsating green s function method for the hydrodynamic calculations of ships advancing in waves in this method the boundary integral equation bie for the radiation and diffraction problems is discretized by using 9 node bi quadratic curvilinear elements the translating pulsating green s function used in the bie is decomposed into rankine source g s and froude dependent component g f for the panel integrals related to rankine source the element geometry and velocity potential are described by the same interpolation functions and the traditional gauss quadrature is employed to calculate the influence coefficients but when it comes to the froude dependent component which is highly oscillatory in the horizontal direction we take a different integral strategy the 9 node element is divided into four quadrilateral elements and a semi analytical scheme is established to calculate the integral over each quadrilateral element in this scheme an analytical expression is derived for the integral along the horizontal direction while gauss quadrature is used for the integral computation along the vertical direction based on the semi analytical method the integrals of g f and its x derivative over a unit square are calculated numerical results show that present method is of good convergence and accuracy as compared with other existing results then this semi analytical high order method is applied to solve the forward speed ship motions in waves the hydrodynamic coefficients wave exciting

decades it is well known that the boundary element panel method based on potential flow theory is a practical and efficient numerical tool to predict them according to the green s function employed in the boundary integral equation the panel methods can usually be divided into two categories rankine source method and free surface green s function method since the pioneering work of hess and smith 1964 the rankine source approach has been widely used in the ship wave problems dawson 1977 peng et al 2014 and seakeeping problems bertram and thiart 1998 zhang et al 2010 the originally proposed rankine source approach is a kind of constant panel method it requires a large number of panels to describe the surface geometry and is hard to obtain desired accuracy of derivatives on the surface to reduce the computational cost and improve the accuracy some researchers combined the rankine source approach with the higher order boundary element discretization for instance kouh and suen 2001 kring et al 2004 and gao and zou 2008 employed non uniform rational b spline nurbs to describe the body geometry shao and faltinsen 2012 he and kashiwagi 2014 and chen et al 2018 used biquadratic isoparametric panels to discretize the body surface generally the higher order rankine source codes developed by them are successfully applied in the ship hydrodynamic problems the major advantage of rankine source method is that it allows for more flexibility in treatment of the free surface condition this implies that for unsteady free surface flow problem more complicated free surface conditions instead of simple uniform flow or neumann kelvin linearization can be considered in the calculations yasukawa 1990 kim and kim 2010 zhang et al 2010 and yasuda et al 2016 considered double body flow as the basis flow to linearize the free surface boundary condition kring 1994 proposed a generalized linear free surface condition containing both uniform flow and double body flow linearizations as subsets and developed a time domain rankine code called aegir kring et al 2004 peltzer et al 2008 to solve the three dimensional potential flow around a ship after continued development aegir is now able to simulate the response of high speed ships rosenthal et al 2013 and solve both linear and nonlinear seakeeping problems o reilly et al 2018 however there are some inherent limitations in the rankine source method 1 the integration regions in the bie include not only the ship hull but also the free surface which will increase the calculation burden and introduce the numerical dissipation and instability 2 the radiation condition ahead of the ship is hard to be satisfied especially for the brard number τ less than 0 25 bertram 2012 in which case the calculation accuracy is often very poor on the other hand the free surface green s function method can avoid these limitations in this method the green s function that automatically satisfies the free surface and radiation conditions is employed in the bie so the singularities are only needed to be distributed on the wetted body surface the main work of this paper is to establish a semi analytical high order free surface green s function method to obtain more stable and accurate numerical solutions of the seakeeping problems with forward speed as early as 1946 haskind 1946 derived the double fourier integral form of translating pulsating green s function but this original form is complex and not suitable for computation for the convenience of calculation some single integral forms such as bessho form bessho 1977 iwashita and ohkusu 1989 du et al 2000 and havelock form havelock 1958 zong and huang 1991 were derived later the translating pulsating green s function is highly oscillatory chen 2000 especially for the filed point approaches the source point near the free surface consequently it will be difficult to obtain a stable and accurate integral value of the green s function over a panel in view of this some efforts were devoted to developing an analytical or semi analytical expression of the panel integral of the green s function for example iwashita 1992 and maury et al 2003 proposed an analytical quadrature of bessho s single integral expression over a panel and hong et al 2016 of our team developed a semi analytical havelock form green s function distributing on a horizontal line segment these analytical and semi analytical expressions have been proved to be more accurate than the traditional numerical quadrature and are able to decrease the oscillations of the calculations recent work on the translating pulsating green s function in both numerical and analytical aspects enables us today to solve the forward speed seakeeping problems by the free surface green s function method but most of the implementations of this method were low order schemes as mentioned above the high order schemes have been successfully used in the rankine source method there are also some published papers about the high order zero speed green s function methods liu et al 1991 teng and taylor 1995 choi et al 2001 but when it comes to the forward speed green s function most of the existing seakeeping codes are low order schemes the main reason for this may be that the translating pulsating green s function is difficult to compute and the corresponding high order algorithm will be very complicated besides in the high order boundary element method the collocation points are located at the nodes of the elements rather than the panel centers liu et al 1991 so the top collocation points of a surface piercing ship are at the free surface which will increase the oscillations of the green s function and consequently make it hard to obtain a stable numerical solution to circumvent these difficulties a new semi analytical high order translating pulsating green s function method is developed we employ 9 node bi quadratic curvilinear elements to discretize the hull surface then the discrete form of bie can be obtained the translating pulsating green s function used in the bie is expressed as the sum of rankine source g s and froude dependent component g f which is highly oscillatory for the panel integrals related to g s the element geometry and velocity potential are described by the same interpolation functions and the traditional gauss quadrature is employed to calculate the influence coefficients but when it comes to g f a completely different integral strategy is adopted we first divide the 9 node element into four quadrilateral elements and in each quadrilateral element a local right handed cartesian coordinate system o ξ η ζ with the ξ o η plane on the element and ξ axis parallel to the mean free surface is defined then the panel integrals in global coordinate system are transformed to the integrals in ξ o η plane in view that g f is highly oscillatory along the horizontal direction but smooth along the vertical direction hong el al different approaches are taken to integrate with respect to ξ and η an analytical expression is derived for the horizontal segment integral with respect to ξ while traditional gauss quadrature is adopted to integrate with respect to η so the so called semi analytical panel integral expressions related to g f and its partial derivatives can be obtained before the numerical implementation singularities in the integrands are analyzed systematically and by performing variable substitution and using the lobatto rule zong and huang 1991 we eliminate the singularity at the critical point θ υ after that the integrals related to g f over the quadrilateral elements can be calculated approximately by adaptive integral method the convergence and accuracy of the present semi analytical high order expression is investigated by the integrals of g f and its x derivative over a unit square we apply this semi analytical high order method to the hydrodynamic calculations of ships with forward speed the hydrodynamic coefficients wave exciting forces and motion responses of a mathematical ship model modified wigley hull advancing at fn 0 2 are first calculated for comparison the experimental data and other numerical results of the cpm and traditional hobem based on numerical quadrature are also shown in this paper wonderful agreement is found between the present results and the experimental data besides the present semi analytical high order method appears to be more stable than the traditional hobem and more accurate than the cpm then numerical simulations are conducted on a navy surface combatant model dtmb 5512 and a full formed ship modified kvlcc2 wave induced heave and pitch motions are calculated and analyzed the present semi analytical hobem is proved to be able to produce satisfactory predictions for the practical ships 2 mathematical model and numerical implementation a right handed inertial reference frame o xyz translating with the mean speed u of the ship is introduced as shown in fig 1 the x axis is taken positive in the direction of the forward speed the z axis points upward and crosses the gravity center of the ship and the origin is located on the undisturbed free surface the incident wave angle β is defined as the angle between the positive x axis and the wave propagation direction the incident wave frequency and wavenumber are denoted as ω 0 and k respectively and a dispersion relationship ω 0 2 g k is found between them for water of infinite depth in the moving reference coordinate system o xyz the incident wave comes with the encounter frequency ω e ω 0 kucosβ 2 1 velocity potential and boundary integral equation the velocity potential φ is introduced to describe the fluid motion under the assumption of ideal and incompressible fluid with irrotational motion within the framework of linear frequency domain potential flow theory the total velocity potential φ can be decomposed as follows 1 φ x y z t ϕ x y z re ϕ i x y z ϕ d x y z ϕ r x y z e i ω e t where ϕ denotes the velocity potential due to the steady motion of the ship ϕ i ϕ d and ϕ r are spatial parts of the incident wave diffraction and radiation potentials respectively by the linear decomposition ϕ r can be further written as ϕ r x y z j 1 6 i ω e x j ϕ j where x j is the complex amplitude of the ship motion in the j th mode and ϕ j is the corresponding normalized radiation potential the key point of the seakeeping problem is the solution of the diffraction potential ϕ d and the radiation potential ϕ j which satisfy the well known laplace s equation and boundary conditions the present study makes use of the direct boundary element method using the translating pulsating green s function g p q to solve this boundary value problem according to the green s third identity the unsteady velocity potential can be obtained by the following boundary integral equation 2 c p φ p 1 4 π s b g p q φ q n q φ q g p q n q d s q 1 4 π g w l 2 u i ω e φ g u 2 φ g ξ g φ ξ d η where φ represents ϕ d or ϕ j p x y z and q ξ η ζ are field point and source point respectively c p is the spatial solid angle at the field point p s b denotes the mean wetted body surface wl is the interaction curve between the body surface and the undisturbed free surface the translating pulsating source green s function g p q can be expressed as 3 g g s g f where g s is defined in terms of distribution of rankine singularities and g f is the froude dependent part of the green s function specially g s is defined as 4 g s 1 r 1 r 1 where r x ξ 2 y η 2 z ζ 2 r 1 x ξ 2 y η 2 z ζ 2 in this paper the froude dependent part g f in havelock form is employed due to its explicit physical meaning and relative ease of calculation according to zong and huang 1991 the froude dependent part g f in eq 3 can be written as 5 g f m n 1 2 0 π 1 m 1 k m e k m α n e 1 k m α n 2 π i h m n π 1 4 τ cos θ d θ where α n z ζ i x ξ cos θ 1 n 1 y η sin θ τ u ω e g k m 1 2 τ cos θ 1 m 1 4 τ cos θ 2 u 2 cos 2 θ g m 1 2 e 1 u u e t t d t arg u π h mn are heaviside step functions whose expressions can be found in the reference xu and dong 2011 2 2 hobem based on 9 node elements in the hobem the bie eq 2 is discretized with 9 node bi quadratic curvilinear elements shown in fig 2 a according to the decomposition of the green s function in eq 3 the integrals over each 9 node element on the right side of eq 2 can be written as 6 i 1 δ s g φ n q d s q δ s g s g f φ n q d s q i 1 s i 1 f i 2 δ s φ g n q d s q δ s φ g s n q g f n q d s q i 2 s i 2 f where i 1 s and i 2 s denote the integrals related to g s and its derivative respectively i 1 f and i 2 f denote the integrals related to g f and its derivative respectively if we use θ to signify the physical or geometrical variables it can be expressed on each element as 7 θ k 1 9 n k s t θ k where θ k represent the variable value at the k th node of the element n k is the shape function associated with the node k whose expression can be found in the reference chen et al 2016 based on the isoparametric transformation the 3d curvilinear elements will be mapped into a 2d parametric plane s t fig 2 b and c illustrate the mapped image and shape functions of the 9 node element respectively substituting eq 7 into the expressions of i 1 s and i 2 s in eq 6 we can obtain 8 i 1 s δ s g s φ n q d s q k 1 9 φ k n q 1 1 1 1 g s n k s t j s t d s d t i 2 s δ s φ g s n q d s q k 1 9 φ k 1 1 1 1 g s n q n k s t j s t d s d t where j s t is jacobian determinant by distributing several gauss points on the standard square element the influence coefficients of related to g s and its derivative can be calculated easily similarly the panel integrals i 1 f and i 2 f in eq 6 which are related to g f and its derivative can also be calculated by the same gauss quadrature used in i 1 s and i 2 s but as we know the froude dependent part g f and its partial derivatives are highly oscillatory along the horizontal direction see fig 3 so if the number of the gauss points distributed in the horizontal direction is not enough considerable errors will be introduced to the numerical calculation of the panel integrals to reduce the integral error semi analytical high order expressions are derived to calculate the panel integrals i 1 f and i 2 f in the following 3 semi analytical high order panel integrals related to g f before deriving the semi analytical high order expressions of i 1 f and i 2 f we first divide the 9 node element into four quadrilateral elements then the integral over the 9 node element can be expressed as the summation of the four panel integrals over the quadrilateral elements 9 i 1 f δ s g f φ n q d s q e 1 4 δ s e g f φ n q d s q i 2 f δ s φ g f n q d s q e 1 4 δ s e φ g f n q d s q where e represent the number of the quadrilateral element 3 1 local coordinate system in each quadrilateral element a local right handed coordinate system o ξ η ζ with the origin at the center is defined as shown in fig 4 the ξ o η plane is on the element and the ξ axis is parallel to the mean free surface the transformation between local coordinate and global coordinate can be written as 10 ξ ξ 0 d 1 ξ d 2 η η η 0 e 1 ξ e 2 η ζ ζ 0 f 1 ξ f 2 η where ξ 0 η 0 ζ 0 is the global coordinate of the quadrilateral element center ξ η ζ and ξ η ζ denote the local coordinate and global coordinate of a point in the quadrilateral element respectively the coefficients d 1 d 2 e 1 e 2 f 1 and f 2 on the right side of the equations are relevant to the angles between the two coordinate systems 11 d 1 cos α x d 2 cos β x e 1 cos α y e 2 cos β y f 1 cos α z 0 f 2 cos β z where α x α y and α z denote the angle between ξ axis and x axis the angle between ξ axis and y axis and the angle between ξ axis and z axis respectively β x β y and β z denote the angle between η axis and x axis the angle between η axis and y axis and the angle between η axis and z axis respectively 3 2 semi analytical expressions of panel integrals in local coordinate system according to the concept of piecewise polynomial approximation in finite element method larson and bengzon 2013 the physical variable θ at any point of the 4 node quadrilateral element can be expressed as 12 θ β 1 β 2 ξ β 3 η β 4 ξ η where β i i 1 2 3 4 are undetermined parameters substituting the node coordinates and nodal values θ i into eq 12 a system of linear equations about β i will be formed by employing cramer s rule we can obtain the solutions of this linear equations 13 β 1 1 d i 1 4 a i θ i β 2 1 d i 1 4 b i θ

different strategies to integrate with respect to ξ and η i e analytical expressions are derived for the horizontal segment integrals with respect to ξ and gauss legendre quadrature is employed to evaluate the integrals with respect to η the semi analytical expressions of the panel integrals over the quadrilateral element can be obtained 14 i 1 4 n o d e f δ s e g f φ n q d s q 1 d k 1 4 i 1 n

normal vector of the element fig 5 illustrates the discretization strategy used in the semi analytical method the key challenge in calculating the integrals in eq 14 lies in the calculation of the

appendix 3 3 analysis of singularity the analytical expressions of the horizontal segment integrals eq 15 18 are θ type single integrals it can be found that the integrands of these integrals are singularity functions in this section the singularities of the integrands will be analyzed systematically 3 3 1 discontinuity points in the integral line segment in the derivation of the analytical horizontal segment integrals the integrands are assumed to be continuous with respect to ξ but in practice the integrands may be discontinuous for a given horizontal segment as they include the complex exponential integral e 1 k m α n and heaviside step function h mn as we know e 1 u is a multi valued function at the negative real axis zong and huang 1991 so the root of imag k m α n 0 is a discontinuous point of the integrands substituting the expressions of k m and α n into imag k m α n 0 we can obtain the discontinuity point of e 1 u 19 θ 0 υ ξ singular 1 2 τ c o s θ x ξ 0 d 2 η c o s θ 1 n 1 y η 0 e 2 η s i n θ 1 m 4 τ c o s θ 1 z ζ 0 f 2 η 1 m 4 τ c o s θ 1 f 1 1 2 τ c o s θ d 1 c o s θ 1 n 1 e 1 s i n θ 20 θ υ π ξ singular x ξ 0 d 2 η c o s θ 1 n 1 y η 0 e 2 η s i n θ d 1 c o s θ 1 n 1 e 1 s i n θ the step function h mn is a discontinuous function according to the expressions in the reference xu and dong 2011 if θ 0 υ where υ is equal to arccos 1 4 τ for τ 0 25 and 0 for τ 0 25 the possible discontinuity points of h mn exists at re k m α n 0 imag k m α n 0 and imag α n 0 but when θ υ π h mn has the only discontinuity point at imag α n 0 by solving these equations the discontinuity points of h mn can be expressed as 21 θ 0 υ ξ singular 1 m 4 τ c o s θ 1 x ξ 0 d 2 η c o s θ 1 n 1 y η 0 e 2 η s i n θ 1 2 τ c o s θ z ζ 0 f 2 η 1 2 τ c o s θ f 1 1 m 4 τ c o s θ 1 d 1 c

the discontinuity points of e 1 k m α n and h mn for a given θ so to ensure the continuity of the integrands we need only to divide the integral segment ξ l ξ r into several subsections by these discontinuity points 3 3 2 singular terms related to k m the wave numbers k 1 and k 2 are associated with the ring wave generated by the pulsating source and the kelvin steady wave generated by the translating source respectively they are important parameters of the integrands of the horizontal segment integrals the typical far field wave patterns corresponding to k 1 under the condition u 0 ω e 0 and k 2 under the condition u 0 ω e 0 are illustrated in the two figures of fig 6 according to the expressions of k m their values are dependent on θ if θ π 2 the denominators of k m will be equal to zero so θ π 2 is the singular point of k m when θ π 2 the limits of k 1 and k 2 are 23 lim θ π 2 k m lim θ π 2 1 2 τ cos θ 1 m 1 4 τ cos θ cos 2 θ g 2 u 2 ω e 2 g m 1 m 2 the results in eq 23 indicate that θ π 2 is a removable discontinuity point of k 1 so if we define k 1 ω 2 g at θ π 2 and calculate k 1 by the formula 24 the singularity of k 1 can be eliminated 24 k 1 4 ω 2 g 1 1 4 τ cos θ 2 however due to k 2 as θ π 2 the computation of k 2 is different from k 1 according to eq 15 18 there are five terms 1 k 2 e k 2 α n k 2 e k 2 α n e k 2 α n e 1 k 2 α n e k 2 α n e 1 k 2 α n k 2 or their combinations related to k 2 in the analytical expressions of the horizontal segment integrals the first term will not cause numerical integral difficulties since 1 k 2 0 as θ π 2 the second and third terms can be written as e k 2 z ζ e i k 2 x ξ cos θ 1 n 1 y η sin θ and k 2 e k 2 z ζ e i k 2 x ξ cos θ 1 n 1 y η sin θ they are oscillatory functions with the amplitudes e k 2 z ζ and k 2 e k 2 z ζ respectively when θ π 2 k 2 will tend to positive infinity and consequently the exponent k 2 z ζ of e k 2 z ζ and k 2 e k 2 z ζ will tend to negative infinity since the field point and source point are both below the free surface i e z ζ 0 in the practical calculation so e k 2 z ζ will tend to zero as θ π 2 and for k 2 e k 2 z ζ the same conclusion can be obtained by using series expansion 25 lim k 2 k 2 e k 2 z ζ lim k 2 k 2 e k 2 z ζ lim k 2 k 2 n 0 k 2 z ζ n n 0 the last two terms related to k 2 can be written as e u e 1 u and e u e 1 u u with u k 2 α n the independent variable u is equal to k 2 α n k 2 z ζ i k 2 x ξ cos θ 1 n 1 y η sin θ since both the field point and source point are below the free surface the real part of u will be less than zero in view of this we calculate the values of e u e 1 u and e u e 1 u u for re u 0 and the typical function images are plotted in fig 7 according to the two figures shown in fig 7 we can see that if the real part of u is less than zero the limits of e u e 1 u and e u e 1 u u are 0 and 1 as imag u or that is to say e k 2 α n e 1 k 2 α n and e k 2 α n e 1 k 2 α n k 2 will tend to be the constants as k 2 and the relative terms in the integrands of the horizontal segment integrals will tend to zero as θ π 2 through the above analysis and mathematical treatment the singularity of k m can be eliminated and no difficulties will be introduced into the integral calculation 3 3 3 singularity of cτ and cn when the brard number τ is larger than 0 25 the denominator of c τ will be equal to zero at θ υ arccos 1 4 τ under this circumstances it will be difficult to obtain accurate results of the horizontal segment integrals eq 15 18 here we take the integral i g f l i eq 15 on a horizontal line segment from 0 433 0 25 0 2 to 0 433 0 25 0 2 for a field point at 0 0 0 as an example for τ 0 26 the integrand of i g f l i with different θ are calculated and plotted in fig 8 a and the coefficient c τ in the integrand is plotted in fig 8 b by comparing the results shown in the two figures of fig 8 we find that the integrand of i g f l i are discontinuous at the singular point of c τ i e θ υ and in the vicinity of θ υ the value of the integrand is much larger than that at other positions so we must take some measures to deal with the discontinuity of the integrand at θ υ to obtain a more accurate integral value according to the expressions of eq 15 18 a new coefficient c n is introduced into the integrands f m n θ f m n ξ θ f m n θ and f m n ξ θ the integrands will be discontinuous at the zero point θ 0 of the denominator of c n i e f 1 i d 1 cos θ 1 n 1 e 1 sin θ but by using the l hospital s rule we can prove that θ 0 is a removable discontinuity of the integrands the limits of f m n θ and f m n θ at θ 0 can be expressed as 26 lim θ θ 0 f m n θ e 1 k m α n e k m α n k m ξ r ξ l 2 π i h m n e k m α n k m ξ r ξ l 27 lim θ θ 0 f m n θ e 1 k m α n e k m α n k m 2 ξ r ξ l 2 π i h m n e k m α n k m 2 ξ r ξ l k m α n ξ r ξ l similarly we can also obtain the limits of f m n ξ θ and f m n ξ θ which is not presented in this paper since their expressions are too complex so if the values of the integrands at θ 0 are supplementally defined the singularity can be eliminated besides another alternative way to eliminate the singularity is via extrapolation in a neighborhood of θ 0 3 4 numerical implementation after the above analysis and treatment we find that the main difficulty in the calculation of the horizontal segment integrals lies in the treatment of the singularity at θ υ see fig 8 in order to eliminate the singularity we divide the integral interval 0 π into 0 ν ν π by performing t cos θ the horizontal segment integrals 15 18 can be converted into some special forms if τ is larger than 0 25 another expression of i g f l i eq 15 can be derived as follows 28 i g f l i l i g f d ξ m n 1 2 0 π 1 m 1 c τ f m n θ d θ m n 1 2 0 π 1 m 1 π 1 4 τ cos θ f m n θ d θ m n 1 2 0 ν ν π

arccos t π 4 τ 1 t d t θ ν π where μ cos ν if τ 0 25 υ will be equal to zero in this case the integrands have no singularity at θ υ and there is no real need to take some special treatment for them but for ease of programing a similar expression as eq 28 is derived for τ 0 25 29 i g f l i m n 1 2 1 1 1 μ t t 1 1 m 1 f m n arccos t π 1 4 τ t d t the uniform expression of 28 and 29 can be written as 30 i g f l i m n 1 2 μ 1 g m n t 1 t t μ d t 1 μ h m n t μ t t 1 d t where g m n t 1 m 1 μ t g t f m n arccos t h m n t 1 m 1 μ t h t f m n arccos t μ t g t 1 i π 4 τ 1 t τ 0 25 0 τ 0 25 μ t h t 1 π 4 τ 1 t τ 0 25 1 π 1 4 τ t τ 0 25 similarly we can convert 16 18 into the following expressions 31 i ξ g f l i m n 1 2 μ 1 g m n ξ t 1 t t μ d t 1 μ h m n ξ t μ t t 1 d t 32 i g x f l i i g y f l i

n arccos t h m n t μ t h t f m n arccos t g m n ξ t μ t g t f m n ξ arccos t h m n ξ t μ t h t f m n ξ arccos t it is obviously observed that the formulas 30 33 have the same form a b f u b u u a d u according to the lobatto rule zong and huang 1991 the integral of this form can be transformed into 0 π f b a 2 b a 2 cos χ d χ by performing u b a 2 b a 2 cos χ which eliminates the singularity at the end points so we can rewrite formulas 30 33 as 34 i g f l i m n 1 2 0 π g m n γ 1 χ h m n γ 2 χ d χ 35 i ξ g f l i m n 1 2 0 π g m n ξ γ 1 χ h m n ξ γ 2 χ d χ 36 i g x f l i i g y f l i i g z f l

and applying adaptive integral method in which the local integration interval length varies with the oscillations of the integrand in each subinterval the horizontal segment integrals can be calculated approximately then substituting the values of segment integrals into eq 14 we can obtain the panel integrals over the quadrilateral element 3 5 convergence and accuracy of the semi analytical method the panel integrals of g f and its partial derivatives over a unit square with its center at 0 0 0 51 and normal vector along the y axis maury et al 2003 are adopted to validate the present high order semi analytical integral method the forward speed and non dimensional encounter frequency are fn 0 1 and ϖ e 2 where ϖ e ω e l g respectively fig 9 a and b plot the typical function distribution of the real parts of g f and its x derivative on the unit square for a field point at the origin drastic oscillations are observed in x axis direction especially for the source points approaches to the free surface while g f and g x f change smoothly along z axis to calculate the panel integrals of g f and g x f by the present high order semi analytical method we need to set the velocity potential φ and its normal derivative φ n q in eq 14 equal to unit one as mentioned above in the semi analytical method the unit square is discretized into a series of segments parallel to x axis on which the integrals are calculated analytically numerical results with different numbers of segments for a field point at the origin are illustrated in fig 10 the abscissa n s in the two figures of fig 10 represents the number of the segments distributed on the unit square it can be seen that both the integrals of g f and g x f will stop changing if the number of the segments is more than 10 which indicates that the present method is of good convergence for comparison the same panel integrals calculated by the traditional gauss method are plotted in fig 11 the number of gauss points distributed along the z axis direction is set equal to 10 since the results in fig 10 show that ten horizontal segments are enough for the calculation of the panel integrals the abscissa of fig 11 is the number of gauss points in x axis direction different from the semi analytical method drastic oscillations are observed in the results of the numerical quadrature the numerical results especially the integral of the x derivative of g f are hard to reach the convergence precision even large numbers of gauss points are distributed in the x axis direction comparisons between the results plotted in figs 10 and 11 indicate that the present high order semi analytical panel integral method is easier to get convergence and stabilization than the traditional gauss quadrature based on the present high order semi analytical method the panel integrals of g f and g x f for a field point describing the z axis are calculated and plotted in fig 12 the calculation condition is described at the beginning of the section and 10 segments are used to discretize the unit square for comparison the accurate results of hong et al 2016 are also illustrated in these figures the excellent agreement between the present results and the existing results indicates that the high order semi analytical method established in this paper has a high accuracy 4 hydrodynamic calculations after calculating the panel integrals related to g s and g f a discrete form of bie can be constructed by substituting 8 9 and 14 into eq 2 then the velocity potential at each node of the 9 node elements can be obtained by solving this discrete bie 4 1 hydrodynamic coefficients and wave exciting forces substituting unsteady velocity potential into the bernoulli s equation newman 1979 the dynamic pressure distribution on the body surface can be computed the unsteady force acting on the ship can be expressed as the integral of the dynamic pressure over the body surface in this paper the unsteady force is divided into the incident wave force diffraction force and radiation force in corresponding to the decomposition of the unsteady potential in eq 1 the sum of incident wave force and diffraction force is called wave exciting force the complex amplitude of the wave exciting force in the i th direction can be expressed as 38 f i w ρ s b i ω e ϕ i ϕ d u ϕ i ϕ d x n i d s the radiation force due to the six degree of freedom motion can be calculated by 39 f i r j 1 6 ρ ω e 2 x j s b ϕ j i u ω e ϕ j x n i d s j 1 6 ω e 2 x j μ i j i ω e λ i j where μ i j and λ i j are added mass and damping coefficients respectively a modified wigley hull is first adopted to validate the present semi analytical high order translating and pulsating green s function method in the calculation of the hydrodynamic coefficients and wave exciting forces the length breadth and draft of the modified wigley hull are 2 m 0 3 m and 0 125 m respectively experimental data about it can be obtained in the references he and kashiwagi 2014 kashiwagi 2013 fig 13 shows the sketch of the mesh used in the calculation where 96 nine node elements are employed to discretize the body surface the case of fn 0 2 is considered in the present study besides the present semi analytical high order method the cpm hong et al 2013 and traditional hobem based on the gauss quadrature are also used in the calculation for comparison the number of the panels used in the cpm is 450 and the same mesh for the present semi analytical hobem see fig 13 is used in the calculation of the traditional hobem fig 14 illustrate the numerical and experimental results of added mass and damping coefficients due to the forced oscillations in heave and pitch it can be seen that the computed results from the present semi analytical hobem and cpm agree well with the experimental data on the whole in the low frequency region the present results are more close to experimental data than that from cpm especially for the heave coefficients i e μ 33 λ 33 different from the above two methods oscillating phenomenon is observed in the hydrodynamic coefficients curves of the traditional hobem the reason for this oscillation can mainly be considered as follows in the hobem the collocation points are chosen at the elements nodes rather than centers so the top field points are in the free surface which will intensify the oscillation of the green s function along the horizontal direction when gauss quadrature is employed to estimate the panel integrals related to the green s function it is hard to obtain stable and accurate results see fig 11 but by using the present semi analytical scheme the oscillations can be decreased then the wave exciting forces acting on the modified wigley hull advancing at fn 0 2 in head wave are calculated non dimensional results of the surge heave and pitch forces are plotted in the three figures of fig 15 respectively it is found that the computed results of the present semi analytical hobem are smooth and show excellent agreement with the experimental data in the whole wavelength range the cpm will underestimate the surge exciting force in the long wave region although good coincidence can be obtained between the experimental and computed results for both heave and pitch forces when it comes to the traditional hobem based on gauss quadrature the similar oscillatory phenomenon as the hydrodynamic coefficients is also observed in the wave exciting forces all of the above numerical calculations are performed on a personal computer with intel i7 4790 cpu of 3 4 ghz the openmp parallel technique chandra et al 2001 is employed to accelerate the computation if 8 threads are used the average consumed time of the cpm traditional hobem and present semi analytical hobem for one frequency are 58 9s 64 3s and 51 6s respectively overall there is no significant difference in the time costs of the three methods the computational efficiency of present semi analytical hobem can meet the need of engineering application since only about 1 min is comsumed for one frequency as stated above we can conclude that the present semi analytical hobem works well in predicting the hydrodynamic coefficients and wave exciting forces of ships advancing in waves besides compared with the cpm and traditional hobem based gauss quadrature the present method is more accurate and stable 4 2 wave induced motions after obtaining the hydrodynamic coefficients and wave exciting forces the wave induced motions of the ships with forward speed can be calculated by solving the motion equation in frequency domain 40 j 1 6 ω e 2 m i j μ i j i ω e λ i j c i j x j f i w i 1 2 6 where m i j and c i j are generalized mass and hydrostatic restoring force coefficient respectively 4 2 1 motions of modified wigley numerical and experimental results of wave induced motions in surge heave and pitch of modified wigley advancing in head wave with the forward speed fn 0 2 are plotted in fig 16 good agreement is found between the present numerical results and the experimental data for the vertical i e heave and pitch motions dominated by hydrostatics and inertia rather than the wave body disturbance the results of the cpm do not show a significant difference with that of the present semi analytical high order method but when it comes to the wave induced motion in surge the cpm obviously underestimates the peak value near λ l 1 0 and overestimate the value in the long wave range this is probably induced by the inaccurate calculation of the wave exciting forces in surge see fig 15 as for motion responses obtained from the traditional hobem based on gauss quadrature due to the oscillation in the hydrodynamic coefficients and wave exciting forces see figs 14 and 15 they show strong instability near the peak value frequency 4 2 2 motions of dtmb 5512 with different forward speed the above results show that the present semi analytical hobem can works well in the hydrodynamic calculation of the mathematical ship model in this section a david taylor model basin dtmb model 5512 is selected to verify the applicability of the present method in practical ship models dtmb 5512 is a 1 46 6 scale model of a navy surface combatant with the length l 3 048 m the principle dimensions of the ship model is shown in table 1 a series of experiments about the wave induced motions of dtmb 5512 in head waves have been conducted by irvine et al 2008 different speeds are chosen for the present investigation the panel distribution of dtmb 5512 is illustrated in fig 17 in which the mean wetted surface is discretized by 160 nine node elements heave and pitch motions of dtmb 5512 are calculated for speeds corresponding to fn 0 19 0 28 and 0 41 over a wide frequency range comparison between the numerical and experimental results is shown in fig 18 it can be seen that the computed heave and pitch motions show good agreement with those of the experimental data especially for the low speed case fn 0 19 both the experimental data and present numerical results display a dependence on the forward speed of the ship the peak values of the heave and pitch motions are found to increase with the increase of the forward speed while the corresponding resonant frequencies are on the contrary on the other hand numerical results of present semi analytical high order method are slightly larger than the experimental data near the resonant frequencies there are many possible reasons for this discrepancy one possible reason is that the free surface condition is linearized by uniform stream which will induce errors near the resonant frequencies for high speed cases another reason may be that nonlinear or viscous effects are neglected in present model nonlinear or viscous effects may not be significant for wave induced motions with low speed but when the speed goes high their effects should not be ignored especially near the resonant frequencies however the present semi analytical hobem can produce satisfactory predictions for all speeds considered on the whole further study for achieving more accurate values near the resonant frequencies is still on the way to see whether the present method still shows advantages over the cpm and traditional hobem in the hydrodynamic calculations of dtmb 5512 we conduct a comparison research on the motion responses obtained from these three methods fig 19 shows the heave and pitch motions of dtmb 5512 at fn 0 28 calculated by different methods 640 panels are used in the calculation of cpm while the same 9 node mesh for the present method see fig 17 are employed in the traditional hobem it can be obviously observed that both the results of the cpm and traditional hobem are more oscillatory than those of present semi analytical hobem this is probably because of the flare in the stern see fig 17 where even the collocation field points of the cpm which are at the panel centers are very close to the free surface in this case the translating pulsating green s function is highly oscillatory chen 2000 and it is difficult to use the gauss quadrature to obtain stable panel integrals related to it consequently unstable results of motion responses are obtained by the cpm and traditional hobem based on gauss quadrature 4 2 3 motions of modified kvlcc2 with block coefficient cb 0 84 finally motion responses for a more full formed ship modified kvlcc2 with block coefficient cb 0 84 are investigated by present semi analytical hobem the length breadth and draft of this ship are lpp 320 m b 58 m and t 20 8 m respectively its body plan is shown in yasukawa et al 2018 and its 3d geometry model can be seen in fig 20 which is discretized by 216 nine node panels just like the above two cases motions of the modified kvlcc2 are also calculated by the cpm and traditional hobem based on gauss quadrature for comparison 840 panels are employed in the calculation of the cpm and panel distribution shown in fig 20 are used in calculation of the traditional hobem and present semi analytical hobem fig 21 shows the computed and measured vertical motions of the modified kvlcc2 at fn 0 166 in head waves it can be seen that the traditional hobem does not give stable predictions of the motions as the other two methods which is similar to the calculations in modified wigley and dtmb 5512 overall motion responses obtained from the cpm and present semi analytical hobem have the similar tendency with the experimental data but near the peak value frequency although results of present method appear to be more close to the experimental data both of the cpm and present semi analytical hobem will over predict the motion responses this is possibly because the steady flow or nonlinear effects cannot be considered in the translating pulsating green s function method as mentioned above 5 conclusions in this paper a semi analytical high order boundary element method based on translating pulsating source green s function is developed for the ship hydrodynamic problems in comparison to other classic boundary element methods such as approximate forward speed method afs rankine source methods including neumann kelvin method double body method and nonlinear method et al bunnik et al 2010 hirdaris et al 2014 kalske and manderbacka 2017 the translating pulsating green s function method can be applied to higher froude numbers and does not need to distribute singularities over the free surface but it is challenging to evaluate the panel integrals related to the green s function the main motivation behind this work is to improve the accuracy and stability of this translating pulsating source method used to predict the wave induced loads and motions of marine vessels with forward speed within the framework of linear potential theory a boundary integral equation is formulated for the hydrodynamic problem in order to solve the bie the body surface is discretized into a series of nine node bi quadratic curvilinear elements the major difficulty in this method is the evaluation of the panel integrals associated with the green s function the forward speed green s function used in the bie is composed of rankine source and froude dependent component different integral strategies are employed to calculate the influence coefficients related to the two components for the rankine source part the element geometry and velocity potential are described by the same interpolation functions and the traditional gauss quadrature is employed to calculate the influence coefficients due to the highly oscillatory properties along the horizontal direction of the froude dependent component a semi analytical scheme is derived for the corresponding integral computation in the derivation we first divide the 9 node element into four 4 node quadrilateral elements so the integral over the 9 node element can be expressed by the summation of the integrals over the four quadrilateral elements then in each quadrilateral element an analytical expression is derived for the integral along the horizontal direction while the integral along the other direction is still calculated by the gauss quadrature the singularities of the semi analytical expression are analyzed and eliminated by performing variable substitution and using the lobatto rule in the numerical implementation the adaptive integral method is adopted to calculate the analytical integral expression along the horizontal direction the convergence and accuracy of the semi analytical scheme is validated by the integrals of g f and its x derivative over a unit square wonderful agreement is found between the present results and other available numerical results in the special case when the field point is in the free surface present semi analytical method can obtain a convergent integral value by distributing several horizontal segments on the square however even if a large number of gauss points is distributed on the square it is hard to use the gauss quadrature to obtain a stable value a computer code based on the semi analytical high order method is developed for the hydrodynamic calculations this code is first applied to solve the radiation and diffraction problems of a modified wigley hull with the forward speed fn 0 2 it is found that the hydrodynamic coefficients and wave exciting forces calculated by the present method agree well with the experimental data and compared with the traditional hobem based on gauss quadrature the present semi analytical is more stable then the wave induced surge heave and pitch motions are calculated for comparison numerical results of the cpm are also shown in this paper the results of present semi analytical hobem are obviously more close to the experimental data than that of the cpm especially for the surge motion finally the wave induced motions of two practical ship models a navy surface combatant model dtmb 5512 and a full formed ship modified kvlcc2 are investigated the wave induced heave and pitch motions display an evident dependence on the forward speed and the present semi analytical hobem is found to be able to produce satisfactory predictions for different ship types and forward speeds acknowledgment this work was supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant no 51579147 appendix a by substituting 12 and 13 into eq 9 the following expressions of the panel integrals related to g f and its partial derivatives over the

22822,in present study high order three dimensional coupled level set and volume of fluid clsvof based simulations about dam break induced tsunami bore interacting with the stationary triangular breakwater was numerically investigated under our clsvof approaching vof advection equation is solved by tangent of hyperbola for interface capturing thinc with weighed linear interface calculation wlic scheme and level set advection equation is solved directly by the high resolution optimized compact reconstruction weighted essentially non oscillatory weno scheme navier stokes equations is solved by a projection method on a fixed staggered cartesian finite difference mesh the pressure poisson equation is solved by the point successive over relaxation psor method the direct forcing immersed boundary method ibm was implemented for breakwater tsunami bore interface treatment numerical experiments based on our high order 3d clsvof thinc wlic ibm method were carried out in a rectangular water channel with a stationary typical triangular breakwater the numerical results were compared with corresponding laboratory experimental results and reasonable agreements were obtained with satisfied accuracy numerical cases with different shape of triangular breakwater are carried out then in order to investigate the free surface evolution and energy dissipation due to the breakwater and useful conclusion is obtained keywords dam break induced tsunamis bore high order clsvof method immersed boundary method thinc wlic scheme triangular breakwater 1 introduction tsunami is nearly the most destructive ocean disasters in the world which is mainly induced by coastal and submarine landslides and oceanic earthquakes for example the december 2004 indian ocean tsunami the march 2010 chile tsunami and the march 2011 japan tsunami caused severe damage in recent years causes serious disasters such as numerous losses of life and economic of coastal area underscored the need for a better understanding of tsunami wave and nearshore structure interaction linton et al 2013 when tsunami waves propagate into nearshore region the wave energy will focus and therefore wave amplitude increases significantly due to the decrease of water depth kocaman and cagatay 2015a as the result to predict the arriving time and the maximum run up height of tsunami wave and its energy dissipation caused by nearshore breakwater by means of numerical models has become an important missions of the tsunami research yang et al 2018a currently as the most commonly used two methods of tsunami wave simulation in physical or numerical model experiments isolated wave and dam break wave are widely used to investigate the interaction of tsunami waves with various nearshore structures since dam break induced wave propagation can be considered as wave propagation caused by a tsunami wave breaking on the coastline that was proposed by visscher and hager 1998 chanson et al 2000 especially the dam break induced wave is capable to better appear the tsunami bore behaviors in the water flume hence physical and numerical models of dam break flows induced tsunami bore have received considerable attention in the past few years nouri et al 2010 al faesly et al 2012 wei et al 2014 a free surface of dam break flow is usually subject to transient large and complex deformations an efficient and useful numerical scheme should able to both accurately predict the free surface position and maintain mass conservation in the same time lee and sheu 2001 shallow water equations had been widely adopted in studying dam break flow as the traditional way aureli et al 2008 shallow water equations is the suitable approaching way to describe dam break flows due to its less computational cost hu et al 2015 brufau and garcia navarro 2000 however because of its 2 d assumptions shallow water equations are inadequate to accurately simulate flows especially involving significant variations of water depth velocity and pressure in the vertical direction such as dam break flow near in stream structures hence the emphasis of numerical dam break research has shifted to the development of navier stokes n s equations based model park et al 2012 celis et al 2017 yang et al 2018b the swes and rans with the κ ε turbulence model are compared with each other for dam break flow impact on a vertical wall kocaman and cagatay 2015b and their result shown that the rans results was better than that of swes results comparing with experimental results normally n s equations based numerical model can be divided into two different category mesh free model and mesh based model mesh free models such as moving particle semi implicit mps method zhang and wan 2014 ng et al 2015 and smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph kao and chang 2011 2012 within that computing and capturing free surface are always relatively easy jobs but they still requires a great number of computing resources two main mesh based models to handle free surface deformation are the volume of fluid vof hirt and nichols 1981 and level set ls osher and fedkiw 2001 2003 methods respectively vof method was paid much attention in the field of the hydrodynamics in these year that was widely adopted in free surface numerical modeling due to its advantage of mass conservation vof methods can be categorized to both a geometrical and an algebraic methods for interface capturing geometrical vof methods which involve geometrical reconstruction such as plic piecewise linear interface calculation parker and youngs 1992 are relatively complicated for coding since it use a linear approximation with the orientation of the interface considered after advection different to geometrical vof method the algebraic vof method has been proposed and developed usefully typical improvement like tangent of hyperbola for interface capturing thinc scheme was proposed by xiao et al xiao et al 2005 which makes use of the hyperbolic tangent function to compute the numerical flux for the fluid fraction function that is able to gives a conservative oscillation less results of the fluid fraction function even for the extremely distorted interfaces use the simple line interface calculation slic to reconstruct multi dimensional numerical flux approximations and meantime consider the orientation of the interface have been reported in yokoi 2007 which is called vof and weighed line interface calculation vof wlic scheme an interface orientation dependent weighting between the original thinc scheme xiao et al 2011 and the first order donor cell scheme is suggested in yokoi 2007 which greatly enhance the geometrical accuracy of the original thinc scheme thinc sw thinc with slope weighting scheme was proposed by xiao et al xiao et al 2011 that presents an improved multi dimensional algebraic vof method to capture moving interfaces according to the interface orientation the interface jump in the thinc scheme is adaptively scaled to a proper thickness application of dam break problems by vof method were carried out to investigates its nonlinear flow behaviors liu et al 2013 marsooli and wu 2014 the ls based method has also become more and more popular for simulating free surface between gas and liquid due to its advantages that the interface is defined by the zero contour of a continuous signed distance function yang et al 2014 zhu et al 2016 such approaching allows the normality and curvature of the interface are easily obtained plus by means of implementing a high order advection scheme the complex topology changes is also easy to deal with kim and liou 2011 but the typical ls based methods contains two important issues first issue is that the deterioration due to numerical dissipation and dispersion in some occasion a useful suggestion is to adopt high order schemes such as weight essentially non oscillatory weno based schemes to handle the advection process for the ls equation hermann 2014 salih and moulic 2009 second issue is that mass conservation a small amount of mass may be gained or lost when the zero level set is altered during a re initialization procedure luo et al 2015 a re initialization procedure which was adopted in sussman s research is suggested for improving the mass conservation sussman and fatemi 1999 an effective option and reasonable technique is to adopt a hybrid approach including ls and vof such as coupled ls vof clsvof method wang and tong 2010 wang et al 2012 balczar et al 2016 clsvof method gathers the advantages from both vof and ls that means it able to further improve mass conservation and calculate curvature of the interface accurately from vof and ls methods respectively to approach such hybrid procedure is first using the vof function to advect the free surface then use the smoothed ls function to obtain the geometrical deformation of the free surface the improved re initialization procedure for ls equation was also usually adopted within clsvof approaching chakraborty et al 2013 ningegowda and premachandran 2014 li and yu 2019 this coupling method was widely used for high precision simulation such as droplet impacting a dry surface yokoi et al 2009 the triangular breakwater as a typical nearshore structure has been widely applied to dissipate the wave energy and protect the people and properties behind it hatice et al 2014 it is always complex and difficult to change the slope of the model in the laboratory experiment cheng et al 2017 but the immersed boundary method ibm is able to simulate the breakwater tsunami bore interface involving stationary or moving bodies which are geometrically complex ibm is applicable to problems with irregular solid objects and does not necessarily have to conform to cartesian grids since the grid does not necessarily conform to the solid boundary the governing equations near the boundary should be modified by imposing a proper boundary condition according to the review paper of mittal and iaccarino 2005 the ibm can be broadly categorized into two classes the continuous forcing and the discrete forcing in the continuous forcing method an explicit forcing term is introduced to the continuous n s equations before discretization typical examples can be seen in the original method of peskin 1972 in comparison with the continuous forcing ibm a sharper representation of the immersed boundary is allowed in the discrete forcing methods ghias et al 2007 hence the ibm is powerful to apply into ocean and coastal engineering region since the geometry and the shape of breakwater are relatively easy to model by means of ibm sassa et al 2016 christensen et al 2018 mondal and alam 2018 in the present study we developed high accuracy 3d numerical model based on clsvof combine thinc wlic scheme with ibm to investigate the dam break induced tsunami bore acting on the triangular breakwater the main purpose of this research is to develop a 3d numerical solver which is able to accurately and efficiently predict dam break induced tsunami wave evolution and its interaction with breakwater with different shapes this paper is organized as follows in section 2 a whole numerical algorithm is given which makes sure that ls function is correctly connected to the identical geometry described by vof function section 3 is presented to describe the interface on the splitting algorithm for clsvof equation advection of vof is solved under the framework of thinc wlic and ls is solved directly from its advection equation by the high resolution ocrweno scheme the ibm is implemented for the evaluation of momentum forcing term which adopts the volume fraction of solid on the body surface or inside the body in section 4 numerical experiments were carried out first in a rectangular flume with one triangular breakwater which was setted as the benchmark case to carry out mesh convengence analysis and mass conservation analysis then compared with the model experiment in order to demonstrate their resolution based on that in section 5 numerical investigate for tsunami bore towards the breakwater with different slopes was carried out and discussed the conclusions are written in section 6 2 mathematical model 2 1 level set ls method in ls method the interface can be tracked by solving the ls evolution equation as follow 1 ϕ t u ϕ 0 where ϕ is the level set function normally setted as a signed distance function d from the space point to the interface d is defined to be positive for liquid negative for gas the interface level always located at zero ψ such as 2 ϕ x t 0 d for x y z in the liquid 0 for x ψ d for x y z in the gas a re initialization equation is solved to re keep ϕ as a signed distance function as follow 3 ϕ τ s ϕ 0 1 ϕ λ δ ϕ ϕ where τ is the pseudo time for the iteration and ϕ 0 is the level set function before re initialization λ and delta function δ ϕ are respectively given as 4 λ ω δ ϕ s

clsvof method a new ls field ϕ is introduced where the interface position is defined by the iso line ϕ 0 first defined the volume fraction f in a grid cell ω of the domain at time t as a function of the ls ϕ 9 f ω t 1 ω ω h ϕ x y z t d x d y where h is the heaviside function 10 h ϕ 1 if ϕ 0 0 otherwise the clsvof algorithm is shown as follows for example if we have fraction function c n of the vof at time n then we have intermediate function ψ as follows 11 ψ 2 c n 1 then solve the following re initialization equation of the intermediate function ψ to a steady state 12 ψ τ s g n ψ 0 ψ 1 0 if ϕ n ε then let 13 ϕ n ψ then solve the following improved re initialization equation of the intermediate function ϕ to a steady state 14 ϕ τ s g n ϕ 0 ϕ 1 λ δ ϕ ϕ 0 finally we have re constructed ϕ

z are the characteristic functions of the vertical interfaces and horizontal interface respectively ω x i j k ω y i j k and ω z i j k in eq 21 are weighting functions the choice of weighting function ω x i j k for x component used in eq 21 is arbitrary three example possibilities are listed in table 1 aniszewski et al 2014 the calculation of n x i j k in table 1 use the vof function yokoi 2007 22

respectively α x is determined by 25 α x 1 i f n x i 0 1 i f n x i 0 here we used n x i c i 1 c i 1 this n x i is used only for the calculation of 24 the parameter β determines the steepness of the

introducing an artificial force to the momentum equations in the vicinity of the immersed boundary ω the resulting momentum equations can be written as 35 u t u u p 1 r e 2 u f as indicated by the name of discrete time momentum forcing method the forcing vector f shown in the above equation can be directly computed from the discrete time momentum vector equation as follows 36 u n 1 u n δ t u u p 1 r e 2 u f the prescribed momentum forcing term will act only on the points nearest the immersed boundary if the boundary surface is not perfectly aligned with the grid plane therefore it is required to interpolate the momentum forcing term so as to render the velocity with a magnitude approximately equal to v ω at the immersed boundary ω 37 f r h s v ω u n δ t in the above equation δ t represents the time interval and v ω denotes the specified velocity along the immersed boundary the vector r h s shown above consists of the pressure gradient convection and diffusion terms in the momentum equations in the case of a stationary solid body where no slip boundary conditions are prescribed v ω 0 will be specified along the boundary 38 u t u u x v u y w u z 1 ρ ϕ p x 1 r e μ ϕ ρ ϕ 2

to be computed only when the grid is on the solid in 3d grids the center of a grid is at x i 1 2 j 1 2 k 1 2 y i 1 2 j 1 2 k 1 2 z i 1 2 j 1 2 k 1 2 we can redefine η using finer grids δ x 1 δ y 1 δ z

z i δ z 1 2 l 1 δ z 1 all the points x l m n y l m n z l m n can be obtained from the above equations and it can be seen how many points fall inside the solid denote the number of points falling inside the solid as np then the solid volume fraction can be denoted as η n p m n l volume of solid 3 3 2 momentum equation solver the second order upwinding scheme is used for the convective terms in

calculated from two consecutive iterations p m 1 p m where m is the iteration counter 4 numerical validation with the 3d parallel numerical solver developed by fortran and openmp first a typical problem which contains analytic solution was adopted to valid the numerical accuracy of ibm then one dam break induced tsunami bore problems with stationary triangular breakwater is numerically carried out for mesh convengence study mass conversation analysis and wave elevation verification respectively 4 1 numerical validation for immersed boundary method ibm to verify the accuracy of ibm one problem which contains analytic solutions is investigated the validation problem is solved in the a square domain with side length l 1 within the domain there has a circular object centered at 0 5 0 5 in x y plane the radius of the circular object is 0 2 the schematic in x y view of this problem is shown in fig 1 boundary condition has an analytic expression as follow 49 u x y z 2 1 y 1 x 2 1 y 2 50 v x y z 2 1 x 1 x 2 1 y 2 51 w x y z 0 after solve the n s equation the pressure field has exact solution as follow 52 p x y z 2 1 x 2 1 y 2 we use l 2 norm to measure the numerical error with three different uniform cell size 0 05 0 025 0 0125 the numerical error results are shown in table 2 it can be seen in table 2 that the numerical errors that the predicted solutions agree very well with the exact solutions the global second order accuracy for velocity and pressure can be obtained 4 2 numerical validation for dam break induced tsunami bore with stationary triangular breakwater 4 2 1 parameters and setting for numerical simulations we choose a model experiment as a benckmark case and for comparison according to the referenced literature hatice et al 2014 as shown in fig 2 the computational domain was 8 90 m long 0 30 m wide and 0 30 m high for simulation all the surfaces of the channel bottom and sidewalls were assumed as smooth a volume of water in the reservoir 4 65 m long 0 30 m wide and 0 25 m high was defined as an initial condition according to the model experiment the probes was located along the channel as shown in fig 2 p 1 p 6 the upstream boundarys was set as wall since no flow entered into the reservoir and downstream boundary was set as velocity outlet the channel sidewalls were chosen as wall tangential and normal velocities were zero at the solid boundary due to defining the no slip condition the computational domain was subdivided into a mesh of fixed rectangular cells using cartesian coordinates the gate was rapidly opened in a very short time t 0 06 0 08 s the effect of triangular breakwater was simulated by ibm within the experiment the six measurement probes of stage hydrographs are setted along the channel p 1 p 6 to obtain water elevation variations over time by digital video images at selected sections the corresponded numerical probes are also setted in the same location during the numerical simulation 4 2 2 mesh convergence study fig 3 shown the experimental water level for probe p 3 and p 5 compare with the temporal evolution calculated in grid interval 5 m m 10 m m and 20 m m using clsvof and ibm in fig 3 time t was multiplied by g h 0 0 5 to get dimensionless time t where g is the acceleration of gravity it is clear that the numerical results converge to the experimental results as the grid interval reduced from δ 20 mm to δ 5 mm the water levels in finer grid interval 5 m m quite well with the experiment result in ref hatice et al 2014 after ensuring that the grids are independent the grid interval 5 m m i e δ x δ y δ z 5 m m is carried out in the other numerical cases in this research 4 2 3 numerical verfication on free surface evolution comparasion results of free surface evolution between numerical and experimental results are shown in fig 4 as well its corresponding 3d free surface behaviors at different times are shown in fig 5 within fig 4 three lines with different section location along y axis were used to represents free surface deformation at each corresponding time the red line represents section with y 0 05 m blue line and yellow line represents y 0 15 m and y 0 25 m respectively in fig 4 and corresponding iso surface profile within fig 5 it can be observed that when the gate was removed a strong dam break wave is generated which propagates over the dry channel when the dam break induced tsunami bore arrives at the breakwater a part of the wave is reflected and a spilling type reflected bore appears travelling along the upstream direction while the other part travels along the downstream of the channel at t 0 90 s the tsunami bore arrives at the top of the breakwater fig 4a at t 1 36 s the tsunami bore just flows past the right toe of the breakwater fig 4b in this period the numerical water front agrees well with the experiment images qualitatively at t 2 80 s the spilling type reflected bore begins to emerge fig 4d after t 3 30 s the spilling type reflected bore begins to move in the upstream direction fig 4e h the spilling type wave breaking is observed in both experimental snapshots and the present computed results after t 3 30 s it can be observed that the numerical solver presents good accordance with experimental snapshots in the spilling type reflected bore and wave breaking however slight discrepancy exists in the propagation speed between the experiment observations and numerical predictions the experiment bore has a little time delay with the assumption of frictionless solid boundaries the propagation of the spilling type reflected bore is over predicted under the frictionless condition in the present ibm model the time delay caused by the gate motion in the experiment also could causes such discrepancy it can be found from figs 4 and 5 that the numerical solver based on clsvof and ibm gaves very good agreement with experimental result clsvof method can handle such strong nonlinear phenomenon very well with enough numerical accuracy 4 2 4 mass conservation analysis beside of numerical verfication on free surface evolution the ability of mass conservation was also carried out for tsunami bore impact on a stationary triangular breakwater problem the mass error m e r r o r is defined as follow 53 m e r r o r m t m 0 m 0 100 where m t ω c t d ω is the mass at the time during the computation and m 0 ω c 0 d ω is the mass at the beginning of the computation the mass error of tsunami bore impact on a stationary triangular breakwater by using clsvof and ibm during the simulation is presented in fig 6 it can be seen that using clsvof gives a good mass conservation result which result from the clsvof is transported using conservative equations which reduce mass conservation errors while retaining the accuracy of interface normal vector even in break up phenomena in other words the clsvof which combines the advantages of thinc wlic and ls schemes makes the nonlinear phenomena of free surface approaching to the experimental results 4 2 5 numerical verfication on free surface elevation along the channel for different probes fig 7 and fig 8 shows the comparison between the numerical and experimental time history curves of water depths at six probes from p1 to p6 agreement between the numerical and experimental results is well achieved probe p1 fig 7a and probe p2 fig 7b are located just a little distance from the gate along upstream and downstream respectively when the gate is removed a strong dam break induced tsunami wave is generated then propagates along downstream meantime the abrupt rise in water depth are observed at p1 and p2 in both numerical results and experimental data t 5 there just has a little change in water depth at p1 and p2 during t 5 40 an abrupt rise in water level at about t 40 as the negative bore from the breakwater can be observed in both the numerical and experimental results after the rising the water depth gradually drop due to the reduction of the incoming flow from fig 7a and b the present model slightly overestimates the water levels in t 40 42 in fig 7a and t 35 40 in fig 7b where the negative bore just reaches the water level measurement positions the possible reason for this difference is that water levels were obtained directly from the digital video images that could ignoring the splash in front of the negative bore in the experiment in fig 7c for probe p3 a rising of the water level during t 2 30 can be observed and an abrupt rising resulted from the arrival of the negative bore is observed at t 30 the results at t 30 of the present model for p3 reveal similar phenomena to those at p1 and p2 some overestimates can be seen during t 32 40 within p3 that may be due to the spilling type wave breaking in front of the negative bore and the splash of the free surface in fig 8a for probe p4 compare with the experimental result the numerical result shows rapid rising in water level during the negative bore through the measurement location of p4 such phenomena may be resulted from the splashes of the wave breaking in front of the negative bore and the hydraulic jump on the free surface are ignored in the experimental measurements in fig 8b for probe p5 it can be observed that there has nearly no elapsed time for travelling between flood positive flow and negative flow since the rapid rising of the water level occurs behind the negative bore therefore water levels constantly rise up to their maximum levels at the measurement locations close to the toe of the breakwater p4 p5 and p6 the maximum water level occurs by comparison it can be found that the numerical method of this paper can better reproduce the quantitative changes of different liquid levels for each section over time numerical result of water level of all probes p1 p6 are always in good agreement with the experimental data during the simulation it also can be observed that the numerical approaching adopted in this paper has very good ability and accuracy on wave elevation capturing 5 numerical results for tsunami bore acting on breakwater with different slopes in this chapter we will investigate the interaction between tsunami waves and breakwaters with different slopes based on the previous chapter we added four numerical cases with different slopes the schematic diagram of different cases is shown in fig 9 as can be seen from fig 9 case 1 is the benchmark case that was adopted in the previous chapter for numerical verification the slope of the breakwater increases gradually from the case 2 to the case 5 in numerical simulation the setting of numerical parameters is basically the same as that in the previous chapter the difference lies in the slope of the breakwater and the length of the numerical flume the length of the numerical flume is re set as 12 m in order to investigate the energy dissipation of the tsunami wave propagating along downstream after acting with the breakwater the position of the left toe of the breakwater keeps unchange among five cases so the kinetic energy of the tsunami wave is the same when it touches the left toe of breakwaters figs 10 12 are the water level elevation time history curves for p2 to p4 respectively as can be seen from figs 10 and 11 as the slope increases gradually the arrival time of the reflected wave to the measuring probes p2 and p3 is also gradually advanced however the maximum water level rising of the reflected waves for five different slopes does not change too much and gradually tends to the same value with time however the nonlinear phenomenon of the reflected wave was increases with the increasing of the slope after the first rise of the water level the change of the water level with time becomes more and more irregular with the increase of the slope as can be seen from fig 12 the water level of case 5 with vertical slope varies dramatically which means a strong breaking wave phenomenon occurs here figs 13 16 is a schematic diagram of the free surface deformation at four typical moments i e the arrival climbing overturning and propagation of the interaction between tsunami wave and breakwater for case 2 5 respectively as can be seen from fig 13 the slope of case 2 is a little higher than that of case 1 but there is no obvious nonlinear phenomenon occurs the water body is relatively uniform and only in the process of climbing and overturning there has slight breaking waves phenomena at the wave head as can be seen from fig 14 with the further increase of the slope in the climbing process the wave head appeared more obvious nonlinear phenomenon and in the process of overturning the wavefront appeared splash phenomenon while in the propagation process of nonlinear phenomenon became relatively strong as the slope further increases it can be seen in fig 15 that nonlinear phenomena such as splash and wave breaking of the wavefront are severe and the wavefront is almost broken in fig 16 we can see that the nonlinear phenomena are very serious the water body is almost completely broken in the process of overturning and the three dimensional effect is very strong meantime the energy dissipation caused by strong turbulence can be created here the results show that the clsvof thinc wlic ibm method developed in this paper can well simulate the strong nonlinear phenomena and time evolution of the interaction between tsunami waves and breakwater in table 2 the listed time are wavefront reaches the position of left end of breakwater where located at 6 15 m and the position of 10 m and 12 m of the water channel respectively from the result of the table we can see that the velocity of wavefront of case 5 is the slowest because the kinetic energy of the tsunami wave keeps the same when it touches the left toe of breakwater within five cases it can be seen that the dissipation of kinetic energy occurs after the tsunami wave acting with the breakwater and such kinetic energy dissipation increases with the increase of the slope of the breakwater it can also be seen from the table that from case 1 to case 3 the time of wavefront arriving at the right end of the water channel has no too much difference it can be observed that strong nonlinear phenomena such as turbulence wave breaking splash are the biggest source of kinetic energy loss during the interaction between tsunami wave and the breakwater 6 concluding remarks in this study the interaction between dam break induced tsunami waves and triangular breakwater was numerically investigated over initially dry downstream channel with five distinct slopes by means of combined 3d clsvof thinc wlic ibm numerical approaching through the process of tsunami waves over the triangular breakwater we have compared the numerical simulation results of water elevation at different sections around the breakwater over time with experimental data the comparison shows that the numerical model we developed in this paper not only can better reflects the entire process of the dam break induced tsunami wave over the breakwater but also is able to reproduces the rich physical phenomena during the process such as changes in wave surface curvature jets wave breaking and other strong nonlinear free surface large deformation phenomena the findings of detailed numerical research show that the impact of dam break induced tsunami wave on breakwater causes wave reflection when the tsunami wave cross after the breakwater the wave speed was turn to slow resulted from energy dissipation due to the existed breakwater strong nonlinear phenomena such as turbulence wave break splash are the biggest source of kinetic energy dissipation during the interaction between tsunami wave and the breakwater to study the interaction between tsunami waves and breakwater the numerical model adopted in this paper is practical and reliable additionally the results of this study can also provide reliable reference for

22822,in present study high order three dimensional coupled level set and volume of fluid clsvof based simulations about dam break induced tsunami bore interacting with the stationary triangular breakwater was numerically investigated under our clsvof approaching vof advection equation is solved by tangent of hyperbola for interface capturing thinc with weighed linear interface calculation

immersed boundary method ibm was implemented for breakwater tsunami bore interface treatment numerical experiments based on our high order 3d clsvof thinc wlic ibm method were carried out in a rectangular water channel with a stationary typical triangular breakwater the numerical results were compared with corresponding laboratory experimental results and reasonable agreements were obtained with satisfied accuracy numerical cases with different shape of triangular breakwater are carried out then in order to investigate the free surface evolution and energy dissipation due to the breakwater and useful conclusion is obtained keywords dam break induced tsunamis bore high order clsvof method immersed boundary method thinc wlic scheme triangular breakwater 1 introduction tsunami is nearly the most destructive ocean disasters in the world which is mainly induced by coastal and submarine landslides and oceanic earthquakes for example the december 2004 indian ocean tsunami the march 2010 chile tsunami and the march 2011 japan tsunami caused severe damage in recent years causes serious disasters such as numerous losses of life and economic of coastal area underscored the need for a better understanding of tsunami wave and nearshore structure interaction linton et al 2013 when tsunami waves propagate into nearshore region the wave energy will focus and therefore wave amplitude increases significantly due to the decrease of water depth kocaman and cagatay 2015a as the result to predict the arriving time and the maximum run up height of tsunami wave and its energy dissipation caused by nearshore breakwater by means of numerical models has become an important missions of the tsunami research yang et al 2018a currently as the most commonly used two methods of tsunami wave simulation in physical or numerical model experiments isolated wave and dam break wave are widely used to investigate the interaction of tsunami waves with various nearshore structures since dam break induced wave propagation can be considered as wave propagation caused by a tsunami wave breaking on the coastline that was proposed by visscher and hager 1998 chanson et al 2000 especially the dam break induced wave is capable to better appear the tsunami bore behaviors in the water flume hence physical and numerical models of dam break flows induced tsunami bore have received considerable attention in the past few years nouri et al 2010 al faesly et al 2012 wei et al 2014 a free surface of dam break flow is usually subject to transient large and complex deformations an efficient and useful numerical scheme should able to both accurately predict the free surface position and maintain mass conservation in the same time lee and sheu 2001 shallow water equations had been widely adopted in studying dam break flow as the traditional way aureli et al 2008 shallow water equations is the suitable approaching way to describe dam break flows due to its less computational cost hu et al 2015 brufau and garcia navarro 2000 however because of its 2 d assumptions shallow water equations are inadequate to accurately simulate flows especially involving significant variations of water depth velocity and pressure in the vertical direction such as dam break flow near in stream structures hence the emphasis of numerical dam break research has shifted to the development of navier stokes n s equations based model park et al 2012 celis et al 2017 yang et al 2018b the swes and rans with the κ ε turbulence model are compared with each other for dam break flow impact on a vertical wall kocaman and cagatay 2015b and their result shown that the rans results was better than that of swes results comparing with experimental results normally n s equations based numerical model can be divided into two different category mesh free model and mesh based model mesh free models such as moving particle semi implicit mps method zhang and wan 2014 ng et al 2015 and smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph kao and chang 2011 2012 within that computing and capturing free surface are always relatively easy jobs but they still requires a great number of computing resources two main mesh based models to handle free surface deformation are the volume of fluid vof hirt and nichols 1981 and level set ls osher and fedkiw 2001 2003 methods respectively vof method was paid much attention in the field of the hydrodynamics in these year that was widely adopted in free surface numerical modeling due to its advantage of mass conservation vof methods can be categorized to both a geometrical and an algebraic methods for interface capturing geometrical vof methods which involve geometrical reconstruction such as plic piecewise linear interface calculation parker and youngs 1992 are relatively complicated for coding since it use a linear approximation with the orientation of the interface considered after advection different to geometrical vof method the algebraic vof method has been proposed and developed usefully typical improvement like tangent of hyperbola for interface capturing thinc scheme was proposed by xiao et al xiao et al 2005 which makes use of the hyperbolic tangent function to compute the numerical flux for the fluid fraction function that is able to gives a conservative oscillation less results of the fluid fraction function even for the extremely distorted interfaces use the simple line interface calculation slic to reconstruct multi dimensional numerical flux approximations and meantime consider the orientation of the interface have been reported in yokoi 2007 which is called vof and weighed line interface calculation vof wlic scheme an interface orientation dependent weighting between the original thinc scheme xiao et al 2011 and the first order donor cell scheme is suggested in yokoi 2007 which greatly enhance the geometrical accuracy of the original thinc scheme thinc sw thinc with slope weighting scheme was proposed by xiao et al xiao et al 2011 that presents an improved multi dimensional algebraic vof method to capture moving interfaces according to the interface orientation the interface jump in the thinc scheme is adaptively scaled to a proper thickness application of dam break problems by vof method were carried out to investigates its nonlinear flow behaviors liu et al 2013 marsooli and wu 2014 the ls based method has also become more and more popular for simulating free surface between gas and liquid due to its advantages that the interface is defined by the zero contour of a continuous signed distance function yang et al 2014 zhu et al 2016 such approaching allows the normality and curvature of the interface are easily obtained plus by means of implementing a high order advection scheme the complex topology changes is also easy to deal with kim and liou 2011 but the typical ls based methods contains two important issues first issue is that the deterioration due to numerical dissipation and dispersion in some occasion a useful suggestion is to adopt high order schemes such as weight essentially non oscillatory weno based schemes to handle the advection process for the ls equation hermann 2014 salih and moulic 2009 second issue is that mass conservation a small amount of mass may be gained or lost when the zero level set is altered during a re initialization procedure luo et al 2015 a re initialization procedure which was adopted in sussman s research is suggested for improving the mass conservation sussman and fatemi 1999 an effective option and reasonable technique is to adopt a hybrid approach including ls and vof such as coupled ls vof clsvof method wang and tong 2010 wang et al 2012 balczar et al 2016 clsvof method gathers the advantages from both vof and ls that means it able to further improve mass conservation and calculate curvature of the interface accurately from vof and ls methods respectively to approach such hybrid procedure is first using the vof function to advect the free surface then use the smoothed ls function to obtain the geometrical deformation of the free surface the improved re initialization procedure for ls equation was also usually adopted within clsvof approaching chakraborty et al 2013 ningegowda and premachandran 2014 li and yu 2019 this coupling method was widely used for high precision simulation such as droplet impacting a dry surface yokoi et al 2009 the triangular breakwater as a typical nearshore structure has been widely applied to dissipate the wave energy and protect the people and properties behind it hatice et al 2014 it is always complex and difficult to change the slope of the model in the laboratory experiment cheng et al 2017 but the immersed boundary method ibm is able to simulate the breakwater tsunami bore interface involving stationary or moving bodies which are geometrically complex ibm is applicable to problems with irregular solid objects and does not necessarily have to conform to cartesian grids since the grid does not necessarily conform to the solid boundary the governing equations near the boundary should be modified by imposing a proper boundary condition according to the review paper of mittal and iaccarino 2005 the ibm can be broadly categorized into two classes the continuous forcing and the discrete forcing in the continuous forcing method an explicit forcing term is introduced to the continuous n s equations before discretization typical examples can be seen in the original method of peskin 1972 in comparison with the continuous forcing ibm a sharper representation of the immersed boundary is allowed in the discrete forcing methods ghias et al 2007 hence the ibm is powerful to apply into ocean and coastal engineering region since the geometry and the shape of breakwater are relatively easy to model by means of ibm sassa et al 2016 christensen et al 2018 mondal and alam 2018 in the present study we developed high accuracy 3d numerical model based on clsvof combine thinc wlic scheme with ibm to investigate the dam break induced tsunami bore acting on the triangular breakwater the main purpose of this research is to develop a 3d numerical solver which is able to accurately and efficiently predict dam break induced tsunami wave evolution and its interaction with breakwater with different shapes this paper is organized as follows in section 2 a whole numerical algorithm is given which makes sure that ls function is correctly connected to the identical geometry described by vof function section 3 is presented to describe the interface on the splitting algorithm for clsvof equation advection of vof is solved under the framework of thinc wlic and ls is solved directly from its advection equation by the high resolution ocrweno scheme the ibm is implemented for the evaluation of momentum forcing term which adopts the volume fraction of solid on the body surface or inside the body in section 4 numerical experiments were carried out first in a rectangular flume with one triangular breakwater which was setted as the benchmark case to carry out mesh convengence analysis and mass conservation analysis then compared with the model experiment in order to demonstrate their resolution based on that in section 5 numerical investigate for tsunami bore towards the breakwater with different slopes was carried out and discussed the conclusions are written in section 6 2 mathematical model 2 1 level set ls method in ls method the interface can be tracked by solving the ls evolution equation as follow 1 ϕ t u ϕ 0 where ϕ is the level set function normally setted as a signed distance function d from the space point to the interface d is defined to be positive for liquid negative for gas the

introducing an artificial force to the momentum equations in the vicinity of the immersed boundary ω the resulting momentum equations can be written as 35 u t u u p 1 r e 2 u f as indicated by the name of discrete time momentum forcing method the forcing vector f shown in the above equation can be directly computed from the discrete time momentum vector equation as follows 36 u n 1 u n δ t u u p 1 r e 2 u f the prescribed momentum forcing term will act only on the points nearest the immersed boundary if the boundary surface is not perfectly aligned with the grid plane therefore it is required to interpolate the momentum forcing term so as to render the velocity with a magnitude approximately equal to v ω at the immersed boundary ω 37 f r h s v ω u n δ t in the above equation δ t

calculated from two consecutive iterations p m 1 p m where m is the iteration counter 4 numerical validation with the 3d parallel numerical solver developed by fortran and openmp first a typical problem which contains analytic solution was adopted to valid the numerical accuracy of ibm then one dam break induced tsunami bore problems with stationary triangular breakwater is numerically carried out for mesh convengence study mass conversation analysis and wave elevation verification respectively 4 1 numerical validation for immersed boundary method ibm to verify the accuracy of ibm one problem which contains analytic solutions is investigated the validation problem is solved in the a square domain with side length l 1 within the domain there has a circular object centered at 0 5 0 5 in x y plane the radius of the circular object is 0 2 the schematic in x y view of this problem is shown in fig 1 boundary condition has an analytic expression as follow 49 u x y z 2 1 y 1 x 2 1 y

three different uniform cell size 0 05 0 025 0 0125 the numerical error results are shown in table 2 it can be seen in table 2 that the numerical errors that the predicted solutions agree very well with the exact solutions the global second order accuracy for velocity and pressure can be obtained 4 2 numerical validation for dam break induced tsunami bore with stationary triangular breakwater 4 2 1 parameters and setting for numerical simulations we choose a model experiment as a benckmark case and for comparison according to the referenced literature hatice et al 2014 as shown in fig 2 the computational domain was 8 90 m long 0 30 m wide and 0 30 m high for simulation all the surfaces of the channel bottom and sidewalls were assumed as smooth a volume of water in the reservoir 4 65 m long 0 30 m wide and 0 25 m high was defined as an initial condition according to the model experiment the probes was located along the channel as shown in fig 2 p 1 p 6 the upstream boundarys was set as wall since no flow entered into the reservoir and downstream boundary was set as velocity outlet the channel sidewalls were chosen as wall tangential and normal velocities were zero at the solid boundary due to defining the no slip condition the computational domain was subdivided into a mesh of fixed rectangular cells using cartesian coordinates the gate was rapidly opened in a very short time t 0 06 0 08 s the effect of triangular breakwater was simulated by ibm within the experiment the six measurement probes of stage hydrographs are setted along the channel p 1 p 6 to obtain water elevation variations over time by digital video images at selected sections the corresponded numerical probes are also setted in the same location during the numerical simulation 4 2 2 mesh convergence study fig 3 shown the experimental water level for probe p 3 and p 5 compare with the temporal evolution calculated in grid interval 5 m m 10 m m and 20 m m using clsvof and ibm in fig 3 time t was multiplied by g h 0 0 5 to get dimensionless time t where g is the acceleration of gravity it is clear that the numerical results converge to the experimental results as the grid interval reduced from δ 20 mm to δ 5 mm the water levels in finer grid interval 5 m m quite well with the experiment result in ref hatice et al 2014 after ensuring that the grids are independent the grid interval 5 m m i e δ x δ y δ z 5 m m is carried out in the other numerical cases in this research 4 2 3 numerical verfication on free surface evolution comparasion results of free surface evolution between numerical and experimental results are shown in fig 4 as well its corresponding 3d free surface behaviors at different times are shown in fig 5 within fig 4 three lines with different section location along y axis were used to represents free surface deformation at each corresponding time the red line represents section with y 0 05 m blue line and yellow line represents y 0 15 m and y 0 25 m respectively in fig 4 and corresponding iso surface profile within fig 5 it can be observed that when the gate was removed a strong dam break wave is generated which propagates over the dry channel when the dam break induced tsunami bore arrives at the breakwater a part of the wave is reflected and a spilling type reflected bore appears travelling along the upstream direction while the other part travels along the downstream of the channel at t 0 90 s the tsunami bore arrives at the top of the breakwater fig 4a at t 1 36 s the tsunami bore just flows past the right toe of the breakwater fig 4b in this period the numerical water front agrees well with the experiment images qualitatively at t 2 80 s the spilling type reflected bore begins to emerge fig 4d after t 3 30 s the spilling type reflected bore begins to move in the upstream direction fig 4e h the spilling type wave breaking is observed in both experimental snapshots and the present computed results after t 3 30 s it can be observed that the numerical solver presents good accordance with experimental snapshots in the spilling type reflected bore and wave breaking however slight discrepancy exists in the propagation speed between the experiment observations and numerical predictions the experiment bore has a little time delay with the assumption of frictionless solid boundaries the propagation of the spilling type reflected bore is over predicted under the frictionless condition in the present ibm model the time delay caused by the gate motion in the experiment also could causes such discrepancy it can be found from figs 4 and 5 that the numerical solver based on clsvof and ibm gaves very good agreement with experimental result clsvof method can handle such strong nonlinear phenomenon very well with enough numerical accuracy 4 2 4 mass conservation analysis beside of numerical verfication on free surface evolution the ability of mass conservation was also carried out for tsunami bore impact on a stationary triangular breakwater problem the mass error m e r r o r is defined as follow 53 m e r r o r m t m 0 m 0 100 where m t ω c t d ω is the mass at the time during the computation and m 0 ω c 0 d ω is the mass at the beginning of the computation the mass error of tsunami bore impact on a stationary triangular breakwater by using clsvof and ibm during the simulation is presented in fig 6 it can be seen that using clsvof gives a good mass conservation result which result from the clsvof is transported using conservative equations which reduce mass conservation errors while retaining the accuracy of interface normal vector even in break up phenomena in other words the clsvof which combines the advantages of thinc wlic and ls schemes makes the nonlinear phenomena of free surface approaching to the experimental results 4 2 5 numerical verfication on free surface elevation along the channel for different probes fig 7 and fig 8 shows the comparison between the numerical and experimental time history curves of water depths at six probes from p1 to p6 agreement between the numerical and experimental results is well achieved probe p1 fig 7a and probe p2 fig 7b are located just a little distance from the gate along upstream and downstream respectively when the gate is removed a strong dam break induced tsunami wave is generated then propagates along downstream meantime the abrupt rise in water depth are observed at p1 and p2 in both numerical results and experimental data t 5 there just has a little change in water depth at p1 and p2 during t 5 40 an abrupt rise in water level at about t 40 as the negative bore from the breakwater can be observed in both the numerical and experimental results after the rising the water depth gradually drop due to the reduction of the incoming flow from fig 7a and b the present model slightly overestimates the water levels in t 40 42 in fig 7a and t 35 40 in fig 7b where the negative bore just reaches the water level measurement positions the possible reason for this difference is that water levels were obtained directly from the digital video images that could ignoring the splash in front of the negative bore in the experiment in fig 7c for probe p3 a rising of the water level during t 2 30 can be observed and an abrupt rising resulted from the arrival of the negative bore is observed at t 30 the results at t 30 of the present model for p3 reveal similar phenomena to those at p1 and p2 some overestimates can be seen during t 32 40 within p3 that may be due to the spilling type wave breaking in front of the negative bore and the splash of the free surface in fig 8a for probe p4 compare with the experimental result the numerical result shows rapid rising in water level during the negative bore through the measurement location of p4 such phenomena may be resulted from the splashes of the wave breaking in front of the negative bore and the hydraulic jump on the free surface are ignored in the experimental measurements in fig 8b for probe p5 it can be observed that there has nearly no elapsed time for travelling between flood positive flow and negative flow since the rapid rising of the water level occurs behind the negative bore therefore water levels constantly rise up to their maximum levels at the measurement locations close to the toe of the breakwater p4 p5 and p6 the maximum water level occurs by comparison it can be found that the numerical method of this paper can better reproduce the quantitative changes of different liquid levels for each section over time numerical result of water level of all probes p1 p6 are always in good agreement with the experimental data during the simulation it also can be observed that the numerical approaching adopted in this paper has very good ability and accuracy on wave elevation capturing 5 numerical results for tsunami bore acting on breakwater with different slopes in this chapter we will investigate the interaction between tsunami waves and breakwaters with different slopes based on the previous chapter we added four numerical cases with different slopes the schematic diagram of different cases is shown in fig 9 as can be seen from fig 9 case 1 is the benchmark case that was adopted in the previous chapter for numerical verification the slope of the breakwater increases gradually from the case 2 to the case 5 in numerical simulation the setting of numerical parameters is basically the same as that in the previous chapter the difference lies in the slope of the breakwater and the length of the numerical flume the length of the numerical flume is re set as 12 m in order to investigate the energy dissipation of the tsunami wave propagating along downstream after acting with the breakwater the position of the left toe of the breakwater keeps unchange among five cases so the kinetic energy of the tsunami wave is the same when it touches the left toe of breakwaters figs 10 12 are the water level elevation time history curves for p2 to p4 respectively as can be seen from figs 10 and 11 as the slope increases gradually the arrival time of the reflected wave to the measuring probes p2 and p3 is also gradually advanced however the maximum water level rising of the reflected waves for five different slopes does not change too much and gradually tends to the same value with time however the nonlinear phenomenon of the reflected wave was increases with the increasing of the slope after the first rise of the water level the change of the water level with time becomes more and more irregular with the increase of the slope as can be seen from fig 12 the water level of case 5 with vertical slope varies dramatically which means a strong breaking wave phenomenon occurs here figs 13 16 is a schematic diagram of the free surface deformation at four typical moments i e the arrival climbing overturning and propagation of the interaction between tsunami wave and breakwater for case 2 5 respectively as can be seen from fig 13 the slope of case 2 is a little higher than that of case 1 but there is no obvious nonlinear phenomenon occurs the water body is relatively uniform and only in the process of climbing and overturning there has slight breaking waves phenomena at the wave head as can be seen from fig 14 with the further increase of the slope in the climbing process the wave head appeared more obvious nonlinear phenomenon and in the process of overturning the wavefront appeared splash phenomenon while in the propagation process of nonlinear phenomenon became relatively strong as the slope further increases it can be seen in fig 15 that nonlinear phenomena such as splash and wave breaking of the wavefront are severe and the wavefront is almost broken in fig 16 we can see that the nonlinear phenomena are very serious the water body is almost completely broken in the process of overturning and the three dimensional effect is very strong meantime the energy dissipation caused by strong turbulence can be created here the results show that the clsvof thinc wlic ibm method developed in this paper can well simulate the strong nonlinear phenomena and time evolution of the interaction between tsunami waves and breakwater in table 2 the listed time are wavefront reaches the position of left end of breakwater where located at 6 15 m and the position of 10 m and 12 m of the water channel respectively from the result of the table we can see that the velocity of wavefront of case 5 is the slowest because the kinetic energy of the tsunami wave keeps the same when it touches the left toe of breakwater within five cases it can be seen that the dissipation of kinetic energy occurs after the tsunami wave acting with the breakwater and such kinetic energy dissipation increases with the increase of the slope of the breakwater it can also be seen from the table that from case 1 to case 3 the time of wavefront arriving at the right end of the water channel has no too much difference it can be observed that strong nonlinear phenomena such as turbulence wave breaking splash are the biggest source of kinetic energy loss during the interaction between tsunami wave and the breakwater 6 concluding remarks in this study the interaction between dam break induced tsunami waves and triangular breakwater was numerically investigated over initially dry downstream channel with five distinct slopes by means of combined 3d clsvof thinc wlic ibm numerical approaching through the process of tsunami waves over the triangular breakwater we have compared the numerical simulation results of water elevation at different sections around the breakwater over time with experimental data the comparison shows that the numerical model we developed in this paper not only can better reflects the entire process of the dam break induced tsunami wave over the breakwater but also is able to reproduces the rich physical phenomena during the process such as changes in wave surface curvature jets wave breaking and other strong nonlinear free surface large deformation phenomena the findings of detailed numerical research show that the impact of dam break induced tsunami wave on breakwater causes wave reflection when the tsunami wave cross after the breakwater the wave speed was turn to slow resulted from energy dissipation due to the existed breakwater strong nonlinear phenomena such as turbulence wave break splash are the biggest source of kinetic energy dissipation during the interaction between tsunami wave and the breakwater to study the interaction between tsunami waves and breakwater the numerical model adopted in this paper is practical and reliable additionally the results of this study can also provide reliable reference for

22823,orthogonal frequency division multiplexing ofdm has drawn extensive attention in the field of underwater acoustic uwa communication due to its advantages of high transmission rate and high spectrum efficiency unfortunately the practical application of ofdm in uwa communication is subject to severe multi path as well as doppler sensitivity to overcome the impact of doppler generally the value of doppler is estimated by searching the best correlation with the standard copy in time or frequency domain to enable doppler compensation via the resampling however it has been recognized that at the presence of diffuse or time varying multi path the doppler estimated by searching signal level correlation may cause significant mismatch and thus deteriorate the demodulation the reason is that while the doppler is searched in terms of signal level correlation function the purpose of the demodulation is to achieve the minimum bit error rate mber at bit level in this paper a doppler estimation method based on ber search is proposed to transform the signal level doppler estimation into a bit level one finally numerical simulation and sea trial experiments under different doppler scenarios are performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed doppler estimation method keywords orthogonal frequency division multiplexing ofdm doppler estimation bit error rate ber 1 introduction currently the uwa communication technology has been widely investigated and applied in areas such as underwater engineering marine scientific research and offshore oil industry stojanovic 1996 ian et al 2004 jamshidi and moezzi 2015 nonetheless the complicated substantive characteristics of underwater environment generates harsh acoustic channels jamshidi 2011 mousavi et al 2016 which causes some difficulties such as limited bandwidth severe multi path rapid time varying doppler shift and background noise in the uwa channel pose considerable challenges to uwa communication zakharov and kodanev 2000 chitre et al 2008 jamshidi and moezzi 2012 jiang et al 2018 with the capability to achieve high data transmission rate and high spectral efficiency ofdm technology has drawn more and more attention in uwa communication community jamshidi et al 2007 li et al 2008 tu et al 2011 however it has been found compared with the single carrier communication system ofdm communication system exhibits much more sensitivity to doppler and phase noise due to the vulnerability of the sub carrier orthogonality pollet et al 1995 zhang and liu 2007 zhou et al 2017 as the doppler effects on signals can generally be modeled as the process of time compression dilation with a compression factor constant over a measurement interval there have been extensive investigations reported sharif et al 2000 lyonnet et al 2010 jiang et al 2011 the principle idea behind which is to firstly estimate the doppler and then compensate accordingly a straightforward type of doppler estimation method is to directly measure the time difference or spectral peak of preambles specially designed in advance sharif et al 2000 wan et al 2012 while this simple doppler estimation techniques work for single carrier communication schemes its estimation accuracy cannot meet the need of ofdm systems arikan et al 2015 different from the direct estimation strategy the auto correlation based doppler estimation scheme is designed to measure the varied period of periodic transmitted signals with auto correlation between each other li et al 2018 note that as only a time compression or frequency offset parameter is obtained the above two kinds of methods cannot be used when there exists non uniform doppler i e multiple paths associated with different doppler the cross correlation based method has been proposed to estimate the doppler by searching the dominant correlation peak of the cross correlation yao et al 2007 or cross ambiguity function caf between received signal and multiple delayed compressed copies of transmitted signals zakharov and kodanev 1995 because the search is performed in a two dimension delay doppler grid different paths can be identified with the associated different doppler and different time delay nonetheless due to a large number of 2d searching grids this method means a high computational complexity furthermore some novel approaches have been used for doppler estimation such as those based on maximum likelihood estimation yang and zhu 2009 based on multiple signal classification technology mashdour and jamshidi 2014 and based on closed form least squares estimate amar et al 2016 and all of them exhibit satisfactory performance in terms of the estimation strategy the principle of all the above doppler estimation approaches is to search the best signal level match with the standard copy in time frequency or time frequency domain and then perform compensation to attain the bit level purpose of minimum bit error rate mber thus there may exist a mismatch between the signal level estimation and bit level purpose when the best signal level match is difficult if not impossible to search for for example the complicated propagation phenomena in uwa channel such as scattering from rough surfaces or dispersive bottom will cause diffuse multi path pattern i e a cluster of dense paths instead of a single path that means in the presence of complicated multi path uwa channel a doppler value estimated by signal level searching may not always be the optimal one to achieve mber to mitigate the impact of hostile uwa channel on doppler estimation in this paper a mber based principal for doppler estimation is proposed to transform the conventional signal level doppler estimation into a bit level search the numerical simulation and field experiments performed under different doppler scenarios verified the effectiveness of the proposed method compared with the conventional approaches 2 estimation and compensation of doppler 2 1

carrier in the ofdm symbol f c is the center frequency of sub carrier s a denotes the collection of all sub carriers and δ f represents the frequency interval between each adjacent sub carrier expressed as 2 δ f 1 t where t denotes the length of an ofdm symbol the carrier frequency of the k th sub carrier in the ofdm symbol can be written as 3 f k f c k δ f k k 2 k 2 1 where k represents the number of sub carriers and the signal bandwidth is b k δ f suppose that the impulse response of uwa channel can be formulated as johnson et al 1997 4 h τ t p a p t δ τ τ p t where a p t denotes the amplitude response and τ p t is the time delay from the time varying path assume that the doppler factor of each path is ε δ v c thus the time delay of the time varying path can be expressed as 5 τ p t τ p ε δ t under the assumption that a p τ p and ε δ are unaltered in a period the received signal can be described as 6 y t re p a p k s a d k e j 2 π k δ f t ε δ t τ p e j 2 π f c t ε δ t τ p n t t 0 t where n t is the gaussian white noise and equation 6 can be converted into equivalent baseband signal form as 7 y t k s a d k e j 2 π k δ f t e j 2 π k ε δ f k t p a p e j 2 π f k τ p n t where n t is the baseband gaussian white noise one may observe that the received signal is compressed or expanded from original t to t 1 ε δ in time scale thus the doppler of each sub carrier can be written as 8 d e j 2 π k ε δ f k t apparently for the wideband uwa communication system the doppler on each sub carrier is different the equation of doppler estimation by pursuing the best match in time domain can be described as 9 d t t r t t 1 f c where t r and t t denote the time length of the received signal and transmitted signal respectively similarly the doppler estimation in frequency domain can be expressed as 10 d f f r f t 1 f c where f r represents the frequency of a single frequency signal and f t denotes the frequency of the received single frequency signal moreover suppose that x t and y t are transmitted signal and received signal respectively then the cross correlation function can be formulated as 11 ξ c ε x t y t e j 2 π ε 0 1 l r 1 f s where ε is the preset doppler shift l r is the length of y t f s is the sampling rate and is defined as the correlation operation the doppler estimation utilizing cross correlation searching can be written as 12 d c argmax ε c 1 c 2 ξ c ε where c 1 c 2 is the searching range of doppler the implicit prerequisite for doppler estimation using cross correlation algorithm is that the correlation peak is distinct and resolvable however under the uwa channels with diffuse multi path caused by dynamic boundary or dispersive medium the presence of a cluster of correlation peaks makes it difficult to identify the exact location of the maximum correlation peak with the above conventional approaches the doppler is estimated at signal level and then used to achieve the mber of receiver at bit level thus may suffer from significant performance degradation when there exists the mismatch between the signal level estimation and bit level demodulation leading to the estimation bias 2 2 bit level doppler estimation for the proposed bit level doppler estimation approach the doppler is directly estimated by searching the mber among the demodulated results of the known sequence compensated by different doppler value with the purpose to achieve optimal ber match instead of signal level match a mber based principle is proposed and derived as following suppose that x f is the transmitted signal in the frequency domain the ber search strategy can be formulated as 13 j ε x f s d e c f diag e y t 2 2 whereeis defined as the doppler shift of the k sub carriers and it can be given by 14 e e j 2 π ε 0 b e j 2 π ε 1 b e j 2 π ε k 1 b t andfis the k k discrete fourier transform dft matrix which can be described as 15 f e j 2 π 0 k 0 e j 2 π 1 k 0 e j 2 π k 1 k 0 e j 2 π 0 k 1 e j 2 π 1 k 1 e j 2 π k 1 k 1 e j 2 π 0 k k 1 e j 2 π 1 k k 1 e j 2 π k 1 k k 1 moreover s d e c is defined as the decision function that can be utilized to detect from the output signal of the receiver i e 16 s d e c r f 1 r f 0 1 r f 0 where r f is the symbol carried by the output signal therefore the ber optimization problem can be formulated as 17 d λ argmin ε c 1 c 2 j ε the block diagram of the cross correlation search as well as the ber search approach is shown in fig 1 a and fig 1 b respectively where δ f represents the search interval of doppler and ε u and ε l denote the upper limit and the lower limit of the doppler shift respectively specifically taking two ofdm symbols as the doppler estimation signal a certain range of doppler search and compensation is performed on the training frame to produce corresponding ber result the ber associated with different doppler value is utilized as an indicator to search the lowest ber to avoid the computational load associated with channel estimation and equalization a classic differential ofdm demodulation haas and kaiser 2003 jiang et al 2006 receiver is adopted in this paper to achieve low implementation complexity moreover in order to reduce computational complexity of the search the range of the bit level doppler search can firstly be determined according to the conventional methods such as frequency domain estimation time domain estimation or cross correlation estimation song et al 2011 to obtain an initial estimation while the search range of the doppler can be obtained via the coarse estimation the accuracy of the doppler estimation is mainly dependent on the searching step i e a smaller searching step will lead to high estimation accuracy at the expense of proportionally increasing computational complexity from the viewpoint of implementation complexity the ber based doppler estimation is equivalent to running the classic ofdm demodulation algorithm several times to produce ber results for comparison as the classic ofdm demodulation actually consists of the low complexity fast fourier transform fft calculation jung et al 2001 the ber based doppler estimation is convenient for hardware implementation in terms of computational complexity 3 experiments and discussions 3 1 numerical simulation in numerical simulation while the single frequency signal and the lfm signal is adopted for frequency domain and time domain doppler estimation respectively doppler estimation signal consisting of two ofdm symbols is used for both ber search estimation and cross correlation estimation thus the frame structure of the transmitted signal was designed as shown in fig 2 to facilitate performance comparison and evaluation with the parameters of which provided in table 1 note that the convolutional coding technique was adopted corresponding to original communication rate and effective communication rate in table 1 for the time domain frequency domain cross correlation method and the proposed method the length of the training sequence for doppler estimation was 22 67 ms 100 ms 136 6 ms and 136 6 ms respectively the doppler estimation signal used for ber based doppler estimation contains two ofdm symbols equivalent to 536 bits for ber calculation a simulation underwater channel was generated with the bellhop model porter and bucker 1987 with a depth of 10 m and a distance of 1 km with the assumption of uniform water medium as well as flat surface and bottom the depth of transceiver was set to 4 m the sound velocity profile was set to a typical negative gradient ranging from 1543 m s to 1540 m s the resulting channel response was displayed in fig 3 indicating the existence of a dominant multipath arrival the white gaussian noise was added to produce a signal noise ratio snr ranging from 2 db to 20 db besides the channel and additive noise a doppler of 10 hz was imposed to the transmitted signal by artificial resampling the doppler estimation and compensation results obtained by the time domain frequency domain cross correlation method as well as the proposed method were illustrated in fig 4 respectively from fig 4 a one could notice that while the doppler obtained by all approaches remained in a range of 8 11 hz the time domain and cross correlation estimation algorithms corresponded to more stable results over different snr meanwhile as revealed in fig 4 b for all the snr conditions the ber dropped to the order of 10 3 after doppler correction according to the doppler estimated by four methods in particular the ber search algorithm yielded error free performance under various snr verifying performance enhancement compared to the other methods which still produced certain error bits under relatively low snr 3 2 sea trial it is straightforward that for underwater acoustic channel there are two typical doppler scenarios that caused by time varying medium and that induced by mobile platform in this study two ofdm communication experiments in shallow water were performed under these two types of doppler scenarios to evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme 3 2 1 the 1st sea trial the data of sea trial 1 was collected from a shallow water channel at wuyuan bay xiamen china which was a semi enclosed bay the depth in the experimental area was about 10 m the signal was transmitted from a transducer fixed at the depth of 5 m and the transmitted signal was received by a transducer mounted at the depth of 6 m the distance between two terminals was 820 m while both the transmitter and receiver were fixed there existed obvious tide and current that caused doppler the parameters of the signal frame in the sea trial 1 were the same as those of numerical simulation the physical sound velocity profile and the channel response were displayed in fig 5 a and fig 5 b respectively as shown in fig 5 b while the experimental channel exhibited multi path pattern there existed a strong and sharp direct path in order to evaluate the performance of this algorithm in time varying channels five frames of ofdm signal collected at different time were adopted to estimate the doppler shift and the results were presented in fig 6 a which provided the doppler shift obtained by time domain estimation frequency domain estimation cross correlation estimation and the proposed ber based estimation respectively as revealed in fig 6 a for static transceiver scenario the doppler shifts estimated by four methods are relatively small in a range from 1 hz to 2 5 hz after obtaining the doppler shift the received signal was resampled to compensate it accordingly as a result the demodulation ber of the original signals and those corrected by resampling was calculated as shown in fig 6 b from fig 6 b one might observe that the original ber was much higher than those obtained after the doppler correction meanwhile behaviors of ber variations compensated by resampling were generally consistent with the proposed approach corresponds to the lowest ber note that the number of error free data frame was three after doppler correction associated with both cross correlation and ber search algorithm one might notice that the ber search algorithm just exhibited slight performance improvement compared to the cross correlation algorithm with both of which outperformed the time domain and frequency domain estimation as the computational complexity of the doppler estimation method is dependent on the total search times for the cross correlation method and the proposed algorithm the ber with respect to different search times was analyzed in fig 7 with the same search range of 10 hz the search grid was set to 1 0 1 0 01 and 0 001 hz for performance comparison which corresponds to the search times of 10 100 1000 and 10000 respectively as presented in fig 7 ber associated with both estimation approaches tended to descend with the increasing of search times with the proposed search algorithm slightly outperformed the cross correlation method under search times larger than 100 3 2 2 the 2nd sea trial the data of the 2nd sea trial was collected from a mobile ofdm communication scenario in shallow water with a depth of about 10 m near xiamen harbor xiamen china the parameters of signal frame were also the same to those in the numerical simulation the transmitter was suspended under a vessel a which approaching to an anchored vessel b at a speed of 2 5 knot under which the receiver was mounted the depth of the transmitter and receiver was 3 m at the beginning of experiment the distance between two vessels was 1 1 km the sound speed profile as well as the channel response was provided in fig 8 a and fig 8 b respectively as displayed in fig 8 b the experimental channel exhibited diffuse multi path with a cluster of densely overlapped arrivals which made it difficult to identify a distinct domain path in the 2nd sea trial totally ten frames of ofdm signal were transmitted for doppler estimation and correction the results of which were shown in fig 9 it could be found from the fig 9 a that the dopper of the 2nd sea trial was much higher than that of the previous one due to the relative motion of the transceiver pair one might also see that while the doppler estimated by the cross correlation estimation and ber search estimation was similar and there was a significant difference from the results obtained using the time domain and frequency domain estimation similarly after resampling according to the estimated doppler the ber results associated with four methods were presented in fig 9 b for performance evaluation as shown in fig 9 b with the original ber close to 0 5 the classic ofdm demodulation completely fails without doppler correction by the proposed ber search and cross correlation method after doppler correction the number of the error free data frame estimated was six and four respectively meanwhile ber results associated with time domain estimation and frequency domain estimation method exhibited substantial performance variations the results of fig 9 b indicated that the proposed doppler estimation approach outperformed the other algorithms under doppler caused by relative motion of the transmitter and receiver similarly the relationship between the ber and search times was also analyzed in fig 10 for the cross correlation method and the proposed algorithm the settings of search range and the searching grid were the same as those of the first sea trial as displayed in fig 10 it is interesting to point out that with the increasing of search times ber of cross correlation algorithm at first slightly decreased but then tend to rise the reason was that the clustered correction peaks caused by diffuse type multi path made it difficult to obtain the real doppler via cross correlation search as a result increasing search times did not improve the ber because of the mismatch between ber and the signal level match of correlation meanwhile for the proposed algorithm the ber exhibited a consistently descend trend with the increasing of search times one may conclude that the proposed ber search estimation method is capable of accommodating the diffuse multi path which may deteriorate the cross correlation search algorithm 3 3 analysis of computational complexity in table 2 we compared the computational complexity of the proposed method and cross correlation method in terms of the multiplicative calculation and additive calculation without loss of generality n f is defined as length of the fft point for ber search as well as the length of lfm signal for cross correlation search from table 2 it is evident that the multiplicative and additive calculation of the cross correlation estimation was about three times that of the ber search method thus we may draw the conclusion that the computational complexity of the proposed mber based algorithm is comparable to that of the cross correlation method due to the simplicity of fft calculation 4 conclusion under adverse shallow water acoustic channels time varying or diffuse multi path may pose significant difficulties to the conventional doppler estimation strategies which are generally designed to search the best match between received signal and the standard copy in time or frequency domain the reason is that caused by highly dynamic boundaries or dispersive medium in shallow water acoustic channels there generally exist one or several clusters of multi path arrivals that makes it difficult to identify the signal level match accurately in this paper we investigated a bit level doppler estimation algorithm based on mber criterion for underwater ofdm communication utilizing the ber as the search criterion the proposed approach is designed to achieve a better match between the process of doppler estimation and that of demodulation the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed algorithm had been verified by the results of numerical simulation as well as sea trials under different doppler scenarios acknowledgement the authors are grateful for the funding of the national nature science foundation of china no 11274259 and no

22823,orthogonal frequency division multiplexing ofdm has drawn extensive attention in the field of underwater acoustic uwa communication due to its advantages of high transmission rate and high spectrum efficiency unfortunately the practical application of ofdm in uwa communication is subject to severe multi path as well as doppler sensitivity to overcome the impact of doppler generally the value of doppler is estimated by searching the best correlation with the standard copy in time or frequency domain to enable doppler compensation via the resampling however it has been recognized that at the presence of diffuse or time varying multi path the doppler estimated by searching signal level correlation may cause significant mismatch and thus deteriorate the demodulation the reason is that while the doppler is searched in terms of signal level correlation function the purpose of the demodulation is to achieve the minimum bit error rate mber at bit level in this paper a doppler estimation method based on ber search is proposed to transform the signal level doppler estimation into a bit level one finally numerical simulation and sea trial experiments under different doppler scenarios are performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed doppler estimation method keywords orthogonal frequency division multiplexing ofdm doppler estimation bit error rate ber 1 introduction currently the uwa communication technology has been widely investigated and applied in areas such as underwater engineering marine scientific research and offshore oil industry stojanovic 1996 ian et al 2004 jamshidi and moezzi 2015 nonetheless the complicated substantive characteristics of underwater environment generates harsh acoustic channels jamshidi 2011 mousavi et al 2016 which causes some difficulties such as limited bandwidth severe multi path rapid time varying doppler shift and background noise in the uwa channel pose considerable challenges to uwa communication zakharov and kodanev 2000 chitre et al 2008 jamshidi and moezzi 2012 jiang et al 2018 with the capability to achieve high data transmission rate and high spectral efficiency ofdm technology has drawn more and more attention in uwa communication community jamshidi et al 2007 li et al 2008 tu et al 2011 however it has been found compared with the single carrier communication system ofdm communication system exhibits much more sensitivity to doppler and phase noise due to the vulnerability of the sub carrier orthogonality pollet et al 1995 zhang and liu 2007 zhou et al 2017 as the doppler effects on signals can generally be modeled as the process of time compression dilation with a compression factor constant over a measurement interval there have been extensive investigations reported sharif et al 2000 lyonnet et al 2010 jiang et al 2011 the principle idea behind which is to firstly estimate the doppler and then compensate accordingly a straightforward type of doppler estimation method is to directly measure the time difference or spectral peak of preambles specially designed in advance sharif et al 2000 wan et al 2012 while this simple doppler estimation techniques work for single carrier communication schemes its estimation accuracy cannot meet the need of ofdm systems arikan et al 2015 different from the direct estimation strategy the auto correlation based doppler estimation scheme is designed to measure the varied period of periodic transmitted signals with auto correlation between each other li et al 2018 note that as only a time compression or frequency offset parameter is obtained the above two kinds of methods cannot be used when there exists non uniform doppler i e multiple paths associated with different doppler the cross correlation based method has been proposed to estimate the doppler by searching the dominant correlation peak of the cross correlation yao et al 2007 or cross ambiguity function caf between received signal and multiple delayed compressed copies of transmitted signals zakharov and kodanev 1995 because the search is performed in a two dimension delay doppler grid different paths can be identified with the associated different doppler and different time delay nonetheless due to a large number of 2d searching grids this method means a high computational complexity furthermore some novel approaches have been used for doppler estimation such as those based on maximum likelihood estimation yang and zhu 2009 based on multiple signal classification technology mashdour and jamshidi 2014 and based on closed form least squares estimate amar et al 2016 and all of them exhibit satisfactory performance in terms of the estimation strategy the principle of all the above doppler estimation approaches is to search the best signal level match with the standard copy in time frequency or time frequency domain and then perform compensation to attain the bit level purpose of minimum bit error rate mber thus there may exist a mismatch between the signal level estimation and bit level purpose when the best signal level match is difficult if not impossible to search for for example the complicated propagation phenomena in uwa channel such as scattering from rough surfaces or dispersive bottom will cause diffuse multi path pattern i e a cluster of dense paths instead of a single path that means in the presence of complicated multi path uwa channel a doppler value estimated by signal level searching may not always be the optimal one to achieve mber to mitigate the impact of hostile uwa channel on doppler estimation in this paper a mber based principal for doppler estimation is proposed to transform the conventional signal level doppler estimation into a bit level search the numerical simulation and field experiments performed under different doppler scenarios verified the effectiveness of the proposed method compared with the conventional approaches 2 estimation and compensation of doppler 2 1 signal level doppler estimation assume that the transmitted ofdm signal can be formulated as 1 x t re k s a d k e j 2 π k δ f t e j 2 π f c t t 0 t where d k represents the data symbol of the k th sub carrier in the ofdm symbol f c is the center frequency of sub carrier s a denotes the collection of all sub carriers and δ f represents the frequency interval between each adjacent sub carrier expressed as 2 δ f 1 t where t denotes the length of an ofdm symbol the carrier frequency of the k th sub carrier in the ofdm symbol can be written as 3 f k f c k δ f k k 2 k 2 1 where k represents the number of sub carriers and the signal bandwidth is b k δ f suppose that the impulse response of uwa channel can be formulated as johnson et al 1997 4 h τ t p a p t δ τ τ p t where a p t denotes the amplitude response and τ p t is the time delay from the time varying path assume that the doppler factor of each path is ε δ v c thus the time delay of the time varying path can be expressed as 5 τ p t τ p ε δ t under the assumption that a p τ p and ε δ are unaltered in a period the received signal can be described as 6 y t re p a p k s a d k e j 2 π k δ f t ε δ t τ p e j 2 π f c t ε δ t τ p n t t 0 t where n t is the gaussian white noise and equation 6 can be converted into equivalent baseband signal form as 7 y t k s a d k e j 2 π k δ f t e j 2 π k ε δ f k t p a p e j 2 π f k τ p n t where n t is the baseband gaussian white noise one may observe that the received signal is compressed or expanded from original t to t 1 ε δ in time scale thus the doppler of each sub carrier can be written as 8 d e j 2 π k ε δ f k t apparently for the wideband uwa communication system the doppler on each sub carrier is different the equation of doppler estimation by pursuing the best match in time domain can be described as 9 d t t r t t 1 f c where t r and t t denote the time length of the received signal and transmitted signal respectively similarly the doppler estimation in frequency domain can be expressed as 10 d f f r f t 1 f c where f r represents the frequency of a single frequency signal and f t denotes the frequency of the received single frequency signal moreover suppose that x t and y t are transmitted signal and received signal respectively then the cross correlation function can be formulated as 11 ξ c ε x t y t e j 2 π ε 0 1 l r 1 f s where ε is the preset doppler shift l r is the length of y t f s is the sampling rate and is defined as the correlation operation the doppler estimation utilizing cross correlation searching can be written as 12 d c argmax ε c 1 c 2 ξ c ε where c 1 c 2 is the searching range of doppler the implicit prerequisite for doppler estimation using cross correlation algorithm is that the correlation peak is distinct and resolvable however under the uwa channels with diffuse multi path caused by dynamic boundary or dispersive medium the presence of a cluster of correlation peaks makes it difficult to identify the exact location of the maximum correlation peak with the above conventional approaches the doppler is estimated at signal level and then used to achieve the mber of receiver at bit level thus may suffer from significant performance degradation when there exists the mismatch between the signal level estimation and bit level demodulation leading to the estimation bias 2 2 bit level doppler estimation for the proposed bit level doppler estimation approach the doppler is directly estimated by searching the mber among the demodulated results of the known sequence compensated by different doppler value with the purpose to achieve optimal ber match instead of signal level match a mber based principle is proposed and derived as following suppose that x f is the transmitted signal in the frequency domain the ber search strategy can be formulated as 13 j ε x f s d e c f diag e y t 2 2 whereeis defined as the doppler shift of the k sub carriers and it can be given by 14 e e j 2 π ε 0 b e j 2 π ε 1 b e j 2 π ε k 1 b t andfis the k k discrete fourier transform dft matrix which can be described as 15 f e j 2 π 0 k 0 e j 2 π 1 k 0 e j 2 π k 1 k 0 e j 2 π 0 k 1 e j 2 π 1 k 1 e j 2 π k 1 k 1 e j 2 π 0 k k 1 e j 2 π 1 k k 1 e j 2 π k 1 k k 1 moreover s d e c is defined as the decision function that can be utilized to detect from the output signal of the receiver i e 16 s d e c r f 1 r f 0 1 r f 0 where r f is the symbol carried by the output signal therefore the ber optimization problem can be formulated as 17 d λ argmin ε c 1 c 2 j ε the block diagram of the cross correlation search as well as the ber search approach is shown in fig 1 a and fig 1 b respectively where δ f represents the search interval of doppler and ε u and ε l denote the upper limit and the lower limit of the doppler shift respectively specifically taking two ofdm symbols as the doppler estimation signal a certain range of doppler search and compensation is performed on the training frame to produce corresponding ber result the ber associated with different doppler value is utilized as an indicator to search the lowest ber to avoid the computational load associated with channel estimation and equalization a classic differential ofdm demodulation haas and kaiser 2003 jiang et al 2006 receiver is adopted in this paper to achieve low implementation complexity moreover in order to reduce computational complexity of the search the range of the bit level doppler search can firstly be determined according to the conventional methods such as frequency domain estimation time domain estimation or cross correlation estimation song et al 2011 to obtain an initial estimation while the search range of the doppler can be obtained via the coarse estimation the accuracy of the doppler estimation is mainly dependent on the searching step i e a smaller searching step will lead to high estimation accuracy at the expense of proportionally increasing computational complexity from the viewpoint of implementation complexity the ber based doppler estimation is equivalent to running the classic ofdm demodulation algorithm several times to produce ber results for comparison as the classic ofdm demodulation actually consists of the low complexity fast fourier transform fft calculation jung et al 2001 the ber based doppler estimation is convenient for hardware implementation in terms of computational complexity 3 experiments and discussions 3 1 numerical simulation in numerical simulation while the single frequency signal and the lfm signal is adopted for frequency domain and time domain doppler estimation respectively doppler estimation signal consisting of two ofdm symbols is used for both ber search estimation and cross correlation estimation thus the frame structure of the transmitted signal was designed as shown in fig 2 to facilitate performance comparison and evaluation with the parameters of which provided in table 1 note that the convolutional coding technique was adopted corresponding to original communication rate and effective communication rate in table 1 for the time domain frequency domain cross correlation method and the proposed method the length of the training sequence for doppler estimation was 22 67 ms 100 ms 136 6 ms and 136 6 ms respectively the doppler estimation signal used for ber based doppler estimation contains two ofdm symbols equivalent to 536 bits for ber calculation a simulation underwater channel was generated with the bellhop model porter and bucker 1987 with a depth of 10 m and a distance of 1 km with the assumption of uniform water medium as well as flat surface and bottom the depth of transceiver was set to 4 m the sound velocity profile was set to a typical negative gradient ranging from 1543 m s to 1540 m s the resulting channel response was displayed in fig 3 indicating the existence of a dominant multipath arrival the white gaussian noise was added to produce a signal noise ratio snr ranging from 2 db to 20 db besides the channel and additive noise a doppler of 10 hz was imposed to the transmitted signal by artificial resampling the doppler estimation and compensation results obtained by the time domain frequency domain cross correlation method as well as the proposed method were illustrated in fig 4 respectively from fig 4 a one could notice that while the doppler obtained by all approaches remained in a range of 8 11 hz the time domain and cross correlation estimation algorithms corresponded to more stable results over different snr meanwhile as revealed in fig 4 b for all the snr conditions the ber dropped to the order of 10 3 after doppler correction according to the doppler estimated by four methods in particular the ber search algorithm yielded error free performance under various snr verifying performance enhancement compared to the other methods which still produced certain error bits under relatively low snr 3 2 sea trial it is straightforward that for underwater acoustic channel there are two typical doppler scenarios that caused by time varying medium and that induced by mobile platform in this study two ofdm communication experiments in shallow water were performed under these two types of doppler scenarios to evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme 3 2 1 the 1st sea trial the data of sea trial 1 was collected from a shallow water channel at wuyuan bay xiamen china which was a semi enclosed bay the depth in the experimental area was about 10 m the signal was transmitted from a transducer fixed at the depth of 5 m and the transmitted signal was received by a transducer mounted at the depth of 6 m the distance between two terminals was 820 m while both the transmitter and receiver were fixed there existed obvious tide and current that caused doppler the parameters of the signal frame in the sea trial 1 were the same as those of numerical simulation the physical sound velocity profile and the channel response were displayed in fig 5 a and fig 5 b respectively as shown in fig 5 b while the experimental channel exhibited multi path pattern there existed a strong and sharp direct path in order to evaluate the performance of this algorithm in time varying channels five frames of ofdm signal collected at different time were adopted to estimate the doppler shift and the results were presented in fig 6 a which provided the doppler shift obtained by time domain estimation frequency domain estimation cross correlation estimation and the proposed ber based estimation respectively as revealed in fig 6 a for static transceiver scenario the doppler shifts estimated by four methods are relatively small in a range from 1 hz to 2 5 hz after obtaining the doppler shift the received signal was resampled to compensate it accordingly as a result the demodulation ber of the original signals and those corrected by resampling was calculated as shown in fig 6 b from fig 6 b one might observe that the original ber was much higher than those obtained after the doppler correction meanwhile behaviors of ber variations compensated by resampling were generally consistent with the proposed approach corresponds to the lowest ber note that the number of error free data frame was three after doppler correction associated with both cross correlation and ber search algorithm one might notice that the ber search algorithm just exhibited slight performance improvement compared to the cross correlation algorithm with both of which outperformed the time domain and frequency domain estimation as the computational complexity of the doppler estimation method is dependent on the total search times for the cross correlation method and the proposed algorithm the ber with respect to different search times was analyzed in fig 7 with the same search range of 10 hz the search grid was set to 1 0 1 0 01 and 0 001 hz for performance comparison which corresponds to the search times of 10 100 1000 and 10000 respectively as presented in fig 7 ber associated with both estimation approaches tended to descend with the increasing of search times with the proposed search algorithm slightly outperformed the cross correlation method under search times larger than 100 3 2 2 the 2nd sea trial the data of the 2nd sea trial was collected from a mobile ofdm communication scenario in shallow water with a depth of about 10 m near xiamen harbor xiamen china the parameters of signal frame were also the same to those in the numerical simulation the transmitter was suspended under a vessel a which approaching to an anchored vessel b at a speed of 2 5 knot under which the receiver was mounted the depth of the transmitter and receiver was 3 m at the beginning of experiment the distance between two vessels was 1 1 km the sound speed profile as well as the channel response was provided in fig 8 a and fig 8 b respectively as displayed in fig 8 b the experimental channel exhibited diffuse multi path with a cluster of densely overlapped arrivals which made it difficult to identify a distinct domain path in the 2nd sea trial totally ten frames of ofdm signal were transmitted for doppler estimation and correction the results of which were shown in fig 9 it could be found from the fig 9 a that the dopper of the 2nd sea trial was much higher than that of the previous one due to the relative motion of the transceiver pair one might also see that while the doppler estimated by the cross correlation estimation and ber search estimation was similar and there was a significant difference from the results obtained using the time domain and frequency domain estimation similarly after resampling according to the estimated doppler the ber results associated with four methods were presented in fig 9 b for performance evaluation as shown in fig 9 b with the original ber close to 0 5 the classic ofdm demodulation completely fails without doppler correction by the proposed ber search and cross correlation method after doppler correction the number of the error free data frame estimated was six and four respectively meanwhile ber results associated with time domain estimation and frequency domain estimation method exhibited substantial performance variations the results of fig 9 b indicated that the proposed doppler estimation approach outperformed the other algorithms under doppler caused by relative motion of the transmitter and receiver similarly the relationship between the ber and search times was also analyzed in fig 10 for the cross correlation method and the proposed algorithm the settings of search range and the searching grid were the same as those of the first sea trial as displayed in fig 10 it is interesting to point out that with the increasing of search times ber of cross correlation algorithm at first slightly decreased but then tend to rise the reason was that the clustered correction peaks caused by diffuse type multi path made it difficult to obtain the real doppler via cross correlation search as a result increasing search times did not improve the ber because of the mismatch between ber and the signal level match of correlation meanwhile for the proposed algorithm the ber exhibited a consistently descend trend with the increasing of search times one may conclude that the proposed ber search estimation method is capable of accommodating the diffuse multi path which may deteriorate the cross correlation search algorithm 3 3 analysis of computational complexity in table 2 we compared the computational complexity of the proposed method and cross correlation method in terms of the multiplicative calculation and additive calculation without loss of generality n f is defined as length of the fft point for ber search as well as the length of lfm signal for cross correlation search from table 2 it is evident that the multiplicative and additive calculation of the cross correlation estimation was about three times that of the ber search method thus we may draw the conclusion that the computational complexity of the proposed mber based algorithm is comparable to that of the cross correlation method due to the simplicity of fft calculation 4 conclusion under adverse shallow water acoustic channels time varying or diffuse multi path may pose significant difficulties to the conventional doppler estimation strategies which are generally designed to search the best match between received signal and the standard copy in time or frequency domain the reason is that caused by highly dynamic boundaries or dispersive medium in shallow water acoustic channels there generally exist one or several clusters of multi path arrivals that makes it difficult to identify the signal level match accurately in this paper we investigated a bit level doppler estimation algorithm based on mber criterion for underwater ofdm communication utilizing the ber as the search criterion the proposed approach is designed to achieve a better match between the process of doppler estimation and that of demodulation the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed algorithm had been verified by the results of numerical simulation as well as sea trials under different doppler scenarios acknowledgement the authors are grateful for the funding of the national nature science foundation of china no 11274259 and no

autonomous underwater vehicles auvs control inertial navigation localization mapping underwater wireless communication 1 introduction most of the earth s surface is covered with water in the form of oceans rivers and lakes many of which remain unexplored till date these environments contain some of the most natural resource rich habitats these habitats directly or indirectly affect humans deployment of underwater robotic vehicles can help to study these environments to ensure their safety against environmental pollution and use the available natural resources for human development manned underwater vehicles have humans on board which increase the risk as well as operational cost so underwater unmanned systems are getting very popular these systems can be used in greater depth and extremely harsh conditions autonomous underwater vehicle auv and remotely operated underwater vehicle rov are two categories of unmanned underwater robotic systems rovs are controlled from the surface generally by a wired connection these can do a variety of tasks but the wired connection limits its manoeuvrability as well as accessibility to remote locations auvs navigate autonomously relying on its navigation algorithm and surrounding information once deployed they collect data and come back to the surface after completion of the predefined task as auvs are not connected to the ground they have high manoeuvrability can travel to remote locations narrow complex pathways involve no human fatigue and operation cost is very less underwater wireless communication has its limitations so auvs have seen an increase in interest from the underwater research community it has always been a challenge to make a robotic device to explore these hostile territories with advancements in auv research materials manufacturing techniques sensors computational power and battery technology autonomous decision making underwater robots have become more reliable and practical a reliable fully autonomous decision making robotic system is the objective of current auv research the first auv spurv the self propelled underwater research vehicle was developed by stan murphy and

3600 m widditsch 1973 in the 1970s few auvs were developed in mit and also in the soviet union remotely operated vehicle committee of the marine technology society these early underwater robots were bulky expensive and inefficient auvs have come a long way since then the modern day auvs can have six degrees of freedom can travel faster than 20 m s accurately detect obstacles and map ocean floors these are getting compact less expensive yet sophisticated and accessible to the general population for exploration fishing and entertainment etc these systems have yet to go a long way in terms of autonomy till fully autonomous robotic systems help us explore and protect these deep and hazardous habitats auvs have a large number of applications in hazardous underwater environments still auvs

techniques auvs depend on its propulsion system to travel in the underwater environment bio mimetic auvs mimic propulsion technique as well as body structure of aquatic animals these auvs travel in water using undulatory propulsion in this technique a pressure difference is created in water by moving some part of their body in a wave like pattern most of these auvs use electric motors for this purpose yang et al 2011 parameswaran and selvin 2011 ashar et al 2013 vo et al 2010 choi and lee 2012 yu et al 2016 zhao et al 2008 and jung et al 2013 used servo and dc motors for moving their body

systems are suitable for surveillance and ecological study as they produce no noise and don t disturb the aquatic animals nearby bio mimetic auvs are incapable of carrying heavy payloads and achieving high speed auvs used for these applications generally use multiple propellers or thrusters for propulsion along with rudders and fins for directional control auvs presented in isa and rizal a 2011 alam et al 2014 jun et al 2009 shome and das 2012 hiller et al 2012 ferguson 2009 hyakudome 2011 starfish hong et al 2010 maya national institute of oceanography nio 2012 and aqua explorer 1000 kato

general dynamics mission systems 2012 and auv presented in hung et al 2008 are some examples of such auvs with fixed thrusters kinematics and dynamics relations of different auvs are discussed in the next section 4 kinematics and dynamics kinematic model of a robot is the mathematical correlation between the inertial non inertial frame and links of a robot which defines the position velocity and acceleration of different parts of the robot with respect to some frame of reference dynamic model correlates forces and moments with the position and velocity of the robot a rigid body auv is considered as a single link manipulator and its kinematic model correlates the body fixed frame and the earth fixed frame as shown in fig 4 the body fixed frame is attached to the geometrical centre of the vehicle with axes in the directions of surge sway and heave respectively earth fixed or inertial x y z frame coincides with the north east down directions and fixed to a point on the water surface as presented in table 3 coordinates along x y z axis x y z and rotational angle about these axis ϕ θ ψ constitute the position and orientation vectors of auv centre of gravity c g in the inertial frame presented as η η 1 t η 2 t t where η 1 x y z t η 2 ϕ θ ψ t linear and angular velocity of the auv c g in the body fixed frame is denoted as ν ν 1 t ν 2 t t where ν 1 u ν w t and ν 2 p q r t parameters in both the frames can be correlated using euler transformation presented as 1 η j η 2 ν where j η 2 is the jacobian matrix detailed derivation of the kinematic and dynamic model is presented in fossen 1994 2011 antonelli 2014 an accurate dynamic model is essential for an auv for its control and navigation fossen et al 1995 have presented non linear modelling of a 6 degree of freedom marine vehicles which can be extended for a rigid body auv the interaction between the motion of an auv and different related forces and torques can be expressed as 2 m v c v v d v v g η τ where m m r b m a m r b and m a are the constant inertia and added mass matrix of the auv respectively c ν c r b ν c a ν c r b ν and c a ν are the coriolis and centripetal matrix of the rigid body and the added mass respectively d ν is the damping matrix containing drag and lift terms g η is the vector of restoring forces and moments which includes gravitational and buoyancy forces and τ is the vector of body fixed forces from the actuators hydrodynamic added mass can be interpreted as virtual mass added to a system because when the body accelerates or decelerates it must move some volume of the surrounding fluid as it moves through it added mass matrix m a depends on the shape of the auv m a is positive and symmetrical for submerged bodies different modern tools such as cad modelling and cfd analysis techniques can be used to find close estimates of these above mentioned parameters different system identification techniques have to be employed to accurately measure these system parameters by comparing the simulated results with the experiments weiss et al 2013 presented a method to develop the dynamic model for underwater vehicles in real time by system identification which can be used for position and velocity estimation this method uses recursive least squares estimator to minimise the square of the error between the modelled and measured response to find out the unknown parameters yue et al 2013 presented a dynamic model for the spherical robot sur ii along with parameter estimation to determine the hydrodynamic added mass matrix to the damping matrix here

essential work class rovs with remotely operated underwater manipulators are being used for underwater intervention and manipulation works these systems are very expensive because of the requirement of skilled operators high bandwidth communication link and they have to be deployed form the ships with sophisticated control stations apart from these operator fatigue is also a major issue cheaper autonomous intervention systems can effectively replace these expensive manipulator systems such intervention auvs i auvs can be easily deployed from less sophisticated surface vehicles and require

with two i auv is presented i auvs are relatively new and in the future we will be seeing more complex as well as cooperative intervention tasks being carried out by these systems dynamic modelling of auvs with manipulator becomes more complex when the hydrodynamic effect of the manipulator on the auv motion is considered following are some study on the dynamic model of auvs coupled with manipulators and other external accessories wang et al 2016 presented a lightweight multi link manipulator structure for minimising the dynamic coupling between the manipulator and the auv wilson et

an auv and its manipulator system jie and wang 2009 presented an underwater robot with two hanging torpedoes and developed a dynamic model for the robot considering the forces exerted by the torpedoes on the robot generally underwater robots rely on tethered communication the cable affects the dynamics of these vehicles schjolberg et al 1996 presented a dynamic model of a robotic system connected to the ship by a cable a flexible auv such as a robotic fish or snake has a body consisting of multiple links in the case of such auvs kinematic and dynamic modelling becomes more complex the dynamic model of such robots correlates different forces along with the forces generated because of the link movements and the motion of the auv some studies with mathematical modelling of such multi link flexible auvs are presented here yang et al 2011 presented a dynamic model for a 3 joint 4 link robotic fish ashar et al 2013 used different link movement patterns for a different motion of the fish robot kinematic relations have been developed for these movement patterns which are further used in the control system vo et al 2010 choi et al 2012b and yu et al 2016 developed kinematic and dynamic models of their flexible robot for control and navigation auvs have to use different control systems and path planning algorithms for navigation in the highly dynamic underwater environment which are discussed in the following section 4 1 planning and control after the development of an accurate dynamic model one needs to develop a control system for the auv to work properly control system regulates the actuator output to obtain the required velocity and position auv controller has three major operations planning control and error diagnostic depending on the mission objective and environmental constraints path plan is developed control enables the auv to follow this path and replanning is done if some constraint is violated the highly non linear behaviour of auv dynamic underwater environment forces and uncertainties in system parameters are some major challenges faced during the design of a control system for an auv multi link flexible body auvs and additional manipulators add more complexity to the problem auvs to operate in a highly dynamic environment controller gains have to be tuned during auv motion thus adaptive or self tuning controllers are highly desirable but still classic control technique such as pid is commonly used in auvs because of its ease of implementation schjolberg et al 1996 adopted a classical pid control strategy for control of the underwater robot and presented a stability analysis of the system by lyapunov theory a simple pid controller was used by jung et al 2013 to control the motion of a slide slipping fish robot on a flow aided path fittery et al 2012 used a simple pd controller with an onboard gyro sensor for estimation of heading angle of the micro pumps of an egg shaped auv isa and rizal a 2011 developed an open loop controller for a propeller driven underwater glider shome and das 2012 implemented a pid controller for auv 150 wilson et al 2011 presented a pid controller having linearised feedback schillai et al 2016 used a depth pid control along with sonar to evaluate the terrain collision risk associated with auvs used in photographic surveys of sea floor apart from simple controllers researchers have developed some advanced control strategies such as non linear control adaptive control sliding mode control and neural network control to address complex dynamic control problem associated with auvs some of these control methods adapted for auvs are discussed by parhi and kundu 2012 and yuh 2000 hyakudome 2011 used a linear quadratic optimum controller with integral action sarhadi et al 2016 proposed an adaptive pid control with an anti windup compensator for an auv such adaptive control strategies are better equipped to handle variable system parameters xiang et al 2015 developed a control strategy to move an auv along a horizontal path in both fully actuated and under actuated configurations a non linear controller was used for an under actuated auv which was later adopted for the fully actuated system fuzzy controllers based on fuzzy logic are most popular control techniques fuzzy logic is a mathematical system which considers analog inputs in the form of a logical variable which can take continuous values between 0 and 1 this method reduces mathematical complexity kato et al 1994 developed a pid and a fuzzy controller for maintaining the altitude of a cable tracking auv and also discussed the cable tracking experiment with sensors sonar and pid control hung et al 2008 used a hybrid fuzzy pid controller where the incremental fuzzy logic controller is used in place of the proportional term with integral and derivative terms intact yu et al 2016 used two stage control law for posture control of the robotic fish first one is the fast position approach which is a modified proportional control for the fish to swim faster towards the target and the second one is the accurate posture adjusting using a time varying feedback stabilization control for position and directional accuracy here fuzzy logic and behaviour based control were used for coordination of multiple fish robots vo et al 2010 developed the dynamic model of a fish robot

dynamics a dual closed loop integral sliding mode control design is used with an outer loop for velocity estimation and an inner loop for actual control input to actuators for trajectory tracking neural network controllers have gained popularity and seen a large scale adoption in recent years because of exponential advancements in computer infrastructure artificial neural networks are computing systems inspired by a biological neural network with machine learning algorithms for data processing li and lee 2005 designed a neural network adaptive controller for an auv here neural network was used to approximate unknown dynamics in the pitch motion wang et al 2014 proposed a neural network pid controller for an amphibious spherical robot the stability of the controller was analysed according to the lyapunov method shojaei 2019 studied a 3d target tracking control for an under actuated auv with a multilayer neural network as discussed above the control strategies in

fleet of multiple auvs kimura et al 2013 presented a control strategy for sotab i sotab spilled oil tracking autonomous buoy allibert et al 2019 presented a vision based non linear control technique for pipeline following apart from following a path or target control strategies can be developed to control depth increase energy efficiency achieve bio mimetic propulsion autonomous docking etc hong et al 2010 presented a depth controller design for a positively buoyant torpedo shaped auv named as starfish here the effect of buoyancy on both pitch and heave dynamics of an auv was studied and a controller scheme was proposed that specifically compensates for the positive buoyancy a cascaded dual loop design with inner sliding mode control and outer proportional control with feed forward loop

valve turning operation with learning by demonstration algorithm simetti et al 2017 discussed individual and also cooperative control of multiple uvms for different intervention tasks such as picking up transportation and deployment antonelli 2014 presented a detailed discussion on i auvs and different control strategy for uvms such as feed forward decoupling control feedback linearisation nonlinear control non regressor based adaptive contro and virtual decomposition based control etc along with the control systems certain navigation and localization techniques are essential for the auvs motion which is discussed in section 7 5 navigation and localization auvs navigate underwater autonomously based on predefined strategy localization is a vital component in navigation which helps an auv to follow the predefined path precisely and reach the final destination non availability of global positioning system gps and high frequency radio signals in the underwater environment makes localization and navigation very challenging for auvs maintaining accuracy in auv s position for a long mission is a difficult task accuracy in position deteriorates over time because of variations in auv motion and absence of an external reference therefore over time different innovative methods have been developed to tackle these problems using a combination of numerical technique and real time sensor data as discussed by stutters et al 2008 auv navigation can be broadly classified as inertial navigation inertial navigation uses different sensor data to estimate vehicle s relative velocity and position acceleration rotational speed and magnetic field intensity data are obtained from accelerometer gyroscope and magnetometer sensors respectively these three sensors are part of the inertial measurement unit imu other sensor data such as relative velocity from doppler velocity log dvl sonar positioning data from gps depth data from pressure sensor etc are used to minimise the error in estimated position acoustic navigation acoustic navigation uses multiple acoustic transponders to estimate auv s position using time of flight concept geophysical navigation geophysical navigation uses unique features in the surrounding as a reference to estimate auv s position and navigate different sensors capable of detecting and identifying these features are used auvs are equipped with different sensors which can provide real time quantitative data of the surrounding all these sensor data have to be processed together using some techniques to obtain an optimal estimate of the vehicle position some of those techniques are kalman filters kfs particle filters pfs and simultaneous localization and mapping slam from these techniques kfs and pfs are numerical techniques for sensor fusion these numerical methods are prone to drift over time in slam method localization is achieved by identifying areas of the environment the robot has already passed through stutters et al 2008 and paull et al 2014 discussed different navigation and localization methods in detail 5 1 inertial navigation systems ins calculates relative position and orientation of a dynamic system relative to a known starting point orientation and velocity using the data from motion sensors accelerometers and rotation sensors gyroscopes ins is a compact inexpensive and self contained system which does not require external references therefore it can be used for inexpensive small auvs however ins can accumulate error over time because the estimated relative velocity and position are the result of mathematical integrations of the accelerometer and gyroscopic sensor data errors in the measurement of this sensor data and errors introduced in integration lead to a significant drift in the estimated position and velocity therefore the estimated position from ins needs to be compared with the data from other systems such as depth sensor compass dvl sonar acoustic doppler current profiler adcp sonar for short missions and from gps on long missions depth sensor compass gps costs between 100 and 1000 usd whereas dvl and adcp sonar cost 20k 200k usd a low cost ins set up uses gps but the auv has to resurface in intervals when operating in greater depth resurfacing is not an option auv has to relay on ins with dvl or adcp sonar p suro auv li et al 2010 used an ins system along with depth sensor sonar and vision system with kalman filter for navigation thompson et al 2012a used kearfott inertial navigation system ins in their mapping auv shome and das 2012 used ekf with ins and dvl for navigation of auv 150 ashar et al 2013 used an ins using a 10 dof imu for a fish robot tal et al 2017 proposed a navigation system for small auv using ins and dvl fusion with partial dvl measurement 5 2 acoustic navigation systems the range is estimated from the time of travel of the acoustic signal for localization some of the popular acoustic navigation systems are ultra short baseline usbl auv is localized relative to a surface vehicle fitted with an array of acoustic transducers fig 6 a relative distance is calculated from the time of travel of the acoustic signal and direction from the phase difference of the signal received by different transducers here the transducers are placed close to one another and major disadvantages is the range the time delay in acoustic communication can cause an error in localization xiao et al 2017 proposed a time delay compensation approach for multi auv cooperative navigation with an ultra short baseline acoustic positioning system short baseline sbl here the transducers are placed in front and back of the surface vehicle fig 6 b thus the baseline is limited to the length of the vehicle which limits the positional accuracy of the auv long baseline lbl in this case the transducers are widely placed over the mission area on the seabed localization is done by triangulating the range estimated by acoustic transducers the major limitation is the huge cost and time involved in placing the transducers on the seabed siddiqui et al 2015 used lbl acoustic ranging sound speed profile was shown to affect acoustic localization and such environmental parameters were considered for effective path planning gps intelligent buoys gibs limitation of lbl can be eliminated by putting transducers with gps buoys on the surface fig 6 c two way communication is used between the auv and gibs the ranges are estimated by using two way travel time of the acoustic signal single transponder to minimise the cost single transponders can be used instead of multiple systems here the baseline is simulated by extending the range with time until the next signal is received straight trajectory towards or away from the transponder results in large positional errors for this case trajectories tangent to the transponder is ideal crasta et al 2015 presented an observability study of an auv with a single transponder in the presence of ocean current using depth measurement and range from the transponder data acoustic modem with these modems information can be transmitted along with the signal used for range estimation using time of flight therefore the transponders need not be fixed and located in the global frame before starting the mission this navigation technique can be used for cooperative navigation with multi auv systems a cooperative localization technique using a minimum of three auv by a tetrahedral geometric method is proposed by allotta et al 2014 three auvs were equipped with cheap ins modules but one had dvl whose benefits were extended by using acoustic communication towards cooperative localization munafo et al 2014 included time information in the acoustic signal which helped in improving auv localization using underwater acoustic sensor networks some of the commercially available acoustic modems are presented in table 4 tang et al 2019 studied a positioning method for auvs in arctic seawater using an electromagnetic field it uses direction of arrival triangulation based on the polarization of near field from three nodes auv estimates its position by comparing the polarized field obtained from three monochromatic sources with different frequencies 5 3 geophysical navigation external environmental features are used as landmarks for localization optical and sonar are the two major categories for geophysical navigation slam is predominantly used for this navigation 5 3 1 optical monocular or stereo cameras can be used to take images of the underwater environment and features extracted from the images can be used for slam visual odometry technique uses dual camera set up for relative velocity and orientation estimation from images captured negahdaripour et al 1991 described a method for orientation and motion estimation using optical sensor and illustrated some examples with real images hildebrandt and kirchner 2010 presented a visual odometry algorithm using stereo vision setup and data from an inertial measurement unit to be used in a slam system calibration is a major problem for visual odometry techniques kunz et al 2010 presented a system for recovering the 7 dof relationship between the auv s estimation frame and the camera rig in order to produce a self calibrated stereo vision setup for sea floor mapping this led to a detailed 3d reconstruction of the underwater structures p suro auv presented by li et al 2010 used an underwater vision system for localization and path planning during the vision test the template matching method with opencv library is used for detecting number patterns wirth et al 2013 presented a vision based motion estimation algorithms combined with inertial measurement units as a low cost sensor for velocity and incremental pose estimation for auv in this work libviso2 and fovis two visual odometry algorithms are used during the experimentation carrasco et al 2015 presented the integration of a stereo vision graph slam system in the navigation and control architecture of the auv sparus ii and showed improvement in localization compared with the fusion of dvl pressure sensor gps and imu sensors with ekf perez et al 2015 presented a benchmarking process used for easy comparison and replication of the results of two 3 d reconstruction algorithms in simulated and real scenarios sukvichai et al 2016 successfully implemented a visual odometry estimation algorithm into the single board computer raspberrypi 2 with the robot operating system ros lin et al 2017 developed a 3d reconstruction method using the laser line scan technique using a binocular stereo vision camera for obstacle avoidance for the auv liu et al 2019 presented a short range vision based docking system for auv a convolutional neural network is used for detection and pose estimation for docking the experiment was carried coupled with a usbl acoustic sensor to evaluate the proposed framework allibert et al 2019 presented a vision based non linear control technique for pipeline following fully actuated auv apart from kinematics full system dynamics have been considered for stability analysis the proposed system was demonstrated with a fully actuated girona 500 auv dark underwater environment scattering of light low visibility range are some major challenges for underwater vision systems lu et al 2017 discussed the issues related to the underwater vision such as poor visibility due to the medium scattering and light distortion and its solution using computer vision recent trends of ocean exploration approaches using optical imaging sensors and computer vision were also discussed hoth et al 2017 proposed a colour reconstruction of underwater images with machine learning so that vision systems can be used for underwater slam cho et al 2018 proposed visibility enhancement technique for visual slam in a turbid environment in most of the auvs object detection systems uses sonar expensive sonar systems can be replaced with optical sensors for object detection in case of small scale auvs advancement in compact high quality cameras techniques such as computer vision and artificial intelligence vision systems have become more reliable over time 5 3 2 sonar sonars are most preferable sensors for underwater mapping and being used for such applications from ages sonars can be used to detect and identify different underwater structural features to be used for navigation imaging sonars produces bathymetric information as a black and white image with hard rocks being dark with maximum reflection and mud lighter with less reflection multi beam bathymetry sonars used for ocean floor mapping by detecting sound reflected back from the sea floor by the multiple arrays of traducers with time delay after processing this information water depth is determined and bathymetric map is developed which can be used for terrain aided navigation tan morice et al 2009 developed a terrain aided navigation correction system for auv here drift was measured by comparing the bathymetric data from the multi beam sonar and previously collected reference map ferguson 2009 and kaminski et al 2010 presented the development of an auv for under ice seabed mapping in the canadian border using echo sounders curado teixeira et al 2016 presented a tan with a bi dimensional particle filter pf and a four dimensional rao blackwellized pf coupled with dvl sonar and imu the major issue with geophysical navigation is the shortage of unambiguous reference landmarks to address such problems teixeira et al 2017 presented three novel practical filter algorithms for tan norgren and skjetne 2018 proposed bathymetric distributed particle filter slam bpslam algorithm for mapping of undersea iceberg topology this method estimates auvs pose in an iceberg fixed coordinate system for auv guidance to cover the iceberg and producing consistent topology ma et al 2018 proposed a robust bathymetric slam bslam to properly estimate inter frame motion and avoid invalid loop closers the algorithm is verified with experimental data set 5 4 state estimator as discussed above kalman filters kfs particle filters pfs and simultaneous localization and mapping slam are some of the popular state estimators used for auv localization with available sensor data kfs and pfs commonly used with ins and acoustic navigation whereas slam with geophysical navigation kalman filter kf is used to derive the best estimate of position from different sensors used the kf estimates the state of a system from multiple uncertain observations using a predict update cycle a physical model describing auv motion can be highly non linear where the kf fails in such a non linear model case an extended kalman filter ekf can be used ekf uses a first order taylor series to approximate the nonlinear processes xiaoping yun et al 2000 developed an ins navigation system for small auv using low cost imu and gps unit an asynchronous kalman filter is used to improve position estimation allotta et al 2012 choi et al 2012a used ekf for auv localization font et al 2016 developed a navigation system with

compared with ekf and observed to reduce localization errors ngatini et al 2017 presented position estimation of auv based on the dynamic model using the ensemble kalman filter enkf and the fuzzy kalman filter fkf and shown that enkf is better in estimating the trajectory of dynamic equation of auv motion choi and lee 2012 proposed an effective movement for the navigation of the fish like robot using the heuristic method kinsey et al 2014 presented a system to estimate the position and velocity of an rov for the navigation using a non linear dynamic model here ekf and non linear observer nlo methods were used for position estimation and it is observed that nlo performed better than kf shao et al 2016 used an adaptive ekf for auv navigation allotta et al 2016a b used unscented kalman filter ukf for auv navigation and presented a comparative study with ekf approach jung et al 2013 presented a navigation strategy for an auv in a flowing medium a biomimetic robot moving in uniform flow using a side slipping manoeuvre was used to showcase the stability of the proposed strategy an accurate dynamic model of auvs are essential for navigation but the error in parameter estimation and some unknown parameters introduce error in navigation shariati et al 2019 proposed a method to estimate the non linear dynamic model of the auv using pf combined with ekf simulated results by the estimated model are compared with the experimental results to validate the model navigation algorithms can also be target specific such as tracking oil spill gas leakage or underwater communication cables etc in these cases different visual and chemical makeup sensors data are incorporated in the navigation algorithm to track these specific targets kimura et al 2013 described the guidance control simulation for designing the underwater robot sotab that tracks oil spill autonomously and gathers oceanographic data numerical simulation was adopted to estimate the manoeuvrability of this robot to compute the hydrodynamic derivatives of the robot usaf datcom method and cfd were used kato et al 1994 presented an autonomous underwater robot aqua explorer 1000 ae1000 used for inspection of underwater telecommunication cables ael000 can find and track buried underwater cables with a cable tracking sensor and the underwater footage of the sea floor is saved on a built in video cassette recorder vcr among the three navigation systems ins is suitable for low cost small scale auvs for short missions and long missions with gps where resurfacing is allowed acoustic navigation is costlier with better accuracy this need transponders to be fitted to support surface vehicles gps buoys or to be placed on the seabed which are time consuming process and before starting each operation the transponders has to be referred globally these limitations can be eliminated by using acoustic modems acoustic modems are suitable for cooperative navigation when existing information of the environment is available such as repetitive routine operations geophysical navigation can be utilised with low cost optical sensors or high precision costlier sonar sensors and different slam techniques 5 5 path planning with object detection and obstacle avoidance navigation algorithm must incorporate object detection and obstacle avoidance mechanism so that the auv does not collide with objects in the underwater environment and damage itself these systems are used for path planning to find an optimal and suboptimal path for navigation navigation algorithms can be deterministic non deterministic or hybridization of both called evolutionary algorithm navigation can be global or local in global navigation prior knowledge of the environment must be available in case of local navigation auv decides and controls its motion and orientation using the available sensor data such as sonar infrared range finder lasers acoustic sensors and stereo vision cameras path planning is simply a multobjective optimization procedure with an objective to reduce travel time shorten path length with safety and smooth trajectory path planning algorithm must quickly adapt to the changing underwater environment and select trajectory based on the surrounding information avoiding obstacles with either minimum time or energy use 3d optimal path planning is essential for auvs but large scale 3d optimization problem has a high computational requirement different optimization algorithm has been developed to address these problems but still more research is required towards the development of auv path planning systems to be used in the highly dynamic underwater environment li et al 2019 presented a detailed review of different path planning techniques used for auvs

robot vision and experimentally verified the system in turbid water section 9 highlights the different communication systems used by auvs 5 6 underwater communication most of the underwater robotic systems rely on tethered communication using lan coaxial or fibre optic cables these cable brings hydrodynamic instability to the auv increases drag and also limits its manoeuvrability and accessibility wireless underwater communication with high speed high volume data is still a major challenge researchers have experimented with different modes of communication for this purpose such as low and high frequency radio acoustic and laser communication vk5br 1987 presented a study on underwater radio communication along with its limitations and solutions shaneyfelt et al 2008 described

system using zigbee protocol and successfully tested its performance acoustic waves are most commonly used underwater communication method employed nowadays because of the lower attenuation in sea water commercial acoustic underwater wireless communication modems are available for low bit rate data transfer the low data rate delay in communication and high energy requirement are some of the disadvantages of the acoustic communication high attenuation in conducting salt water limits the use of high frequency radio waves and low frequency radio waves can be used in shallow waters constant requirement of high data rate low energy consumption gave rise to optical light based communication and hybrid acoustic radio frequency rf communication technique saini et al 2017 presented an analytical study showing the use of radio waves for deep water communication by using an acoustic signal as a complementary part soomro et al 2018 presented an underwater network control system with a

auvs are discussed along with few examples which show the usefulness of the underwater robotic systems different aspects of an auv such as structural design and analysis propulsion dynamics control navigation localization path planning and communication are presented in detail current developments and limitations in the field of auvs are discussed below this will provide an overview of possible research directions auvs can be found in various shapes and sizes from large scale torpedo shaped submersibles jun et al 2009 shome and das 2012 ferguson 2009 hiller et al 2012 hyakudome 2011 hong et

generally large scale auvs dominate this space most of these bulky expensive auvs are difficult to deploy and operate require a lot of energy and can not be used in narrow pathways over the years form factor of computers controllers and sensors have been reduced which can help reduce the size of the auvs significantly till date compact small scale auvs are rare and most of them are bio mimetic auvs these bio mimetic auvs are silent in operation can integrate well into the natural habitat therefore they are mostly used for survey and monitoring purpose in recent years soft and flexible materials have been used to develop lifelike bio mimetic auvs katzschmann et al 2018 such auvs can effortlessly integrate into the habitat and therefore used for close observation of aquatic life however these robots are slow and have very less load carrying capacity a host of research can be done towards the development of compact hybrid auvs with bio inspired aquatic structures and powerful thrusters with ever increasing computational power techniques like cfd and constantly upgrading sophisticated cad modelling software like solidworks and finite element analysis software like ansys researchers can come up with auvs with shape optimized hydrofoil profiles nguyen et al 2018 sun et al 2017 alam et al 2014 to increase efficiency and decrease drag and other unbalancing forces the auv designs can incorporate more bio mimetic components to further increase the efficiency such complex designs can become reality using sophisticated 3d printing techniques composite kang et al 2018 smart and functionally graded materials with higher strength energy harvesting ability have not much used in auvs investigation in this direction can help in increasing the efficiency which will enhance the range of operation in terms of time and distance compact micro robots and bio mimetic auvs can find large applications in surveillance and reconnaissance use of different system identification techniques and sophisticated cad modelling software have enabled researchers to develop accurate dynamic models for the highly non linear dynamic behaviour of the auvs using accurate dynamic models better control systems can be designed increase in the accuracy of the dynamic model increases its complexity and they have become highly non linear apart from simple pid controllers schjolberg et al

li et al 2017 adaptive sarhadi et al 2016 and neural network wang et al 2014 li and lee 2005 controllers have been developed to handle the non linear models more research has to be carried out for developing adaptive controllers suitable for auvs operating in the dynamic underwater environment different innovative navigation methods have been developed over time to have better localization in the underwater environment in the absence of gps and external references from these methods ins is best suited for small scale auvs with short range mission and accuracy can be improved by using dvl sonar stereo vision and other sensors with imu for long missions auvs have to resurface to use gps generally practical and kalman filters are used to estimate the best position using these multiple sensor data in last decade modified kalman filters such as ekf allotta et al 2012 choi et al 2012a font et al 2016 shome and das 2012 asynchronous kf xiaoping yun et al 2000 ensemble kf ngatini et al 2017 fuzzy kf ngatini et al 2017 unscented kf allotta et al 2016a b have seen extensively used in underwater localization and navigation of auvs with complex non linear dynamic model research towards the development of algorithms such as modified kalman filters with accurate and precise sensors can minimise the localization error previously deployed features or use of acoustic transponders munafo et al 2014 siddiqui et al 2015 can help improve auv navigation new generation acoustic modems can be used for cooperative navigation and save cost and time of deploy recovery and tracking of fixed beacons for repetitive mission on a small locality different slam carrasco et al 2015 hildebrandt and kirchner 2010 techniques can be used as in this system auvs map the surroundings in each pass and use this information for localization cooperative navigation with multi auvs allotta et al 2014 xiao et al 2017 can help extend the benefit of one auv s hardware capabilities to others sonar and optical sensors with hybrid ekf slam can further minimise localization errors i auvs have seen significant development in the last few years such autonomous manipulator systems can effectively replace costly and complex semi autonomous and manual intervention missions these systems are in the early stage and need significant research towards the development of fully autonomous systems for complex intervention tasks current research in this field showcased simple intervention task such as self ducking palomeras et al 2016 valve turning carrera et al 2014 search and retrieval of a target object prats et al 2012 sanz et al 2013 and cooperative transportation of payload to ocean floor simetti et al 2017 etc 3d optimal path planning with obstacle avoidance is essential for an auv path planning algorithm must quickly adapt to the dynamic underwater environment various evolutionary optimization algorithm such as genetic algorithm particle swarm optimization and quantum behaved particle swarm optimization has been used for auv path planning graph search schemes fast marching and level set method artificial potential field and rapidly exploring random tree are some of the other optimization methods used for auv path planning evolutionary algorithms are better suited to handle dynamic environments most of the auvs used 2d path planning to avoid the high computational requirement more research has to be carried out towards the development of 3d optimal path planning algorithms for trajectory selection of auvs operating in an unpredictable underwater environment generally in auvs sonars chew et al 2013 jacobi 2015 with different selection algorithms such as fuzzy abbasi et al 2010 choi et al 2012b sigmoid neuro fuzzy xiao et al 2007 are used for object detection and avoidance other such systems are laser gated ranging system he and seet 2001 infrared range finder and acoustic sensors munafo et al 2014 siddiqui et al 2015 for compact low cost auvs such expensive systems can

autonomous underwater vehicles auvs control inertial navigation localization mapping underwater wireless communication 1 introduction most of the earth s surface is covered with water in the form of oceans rivers and lakes many of which remain unexplored till date these environments contain some of the most natural resource rich habitats these habitats directly or indirectly affect humans deployment of underwater robotic vehicles can help to study these environments to ensure their safety against environmental pollution and use the available natural resources for human development manned underwater vehicles have humans on board which increase the risk as well as operational cost so underwater unmanned systems are getting very popular these systems can be used in greater depth and extremely harsh conditions autonomous underwater vehicle auv and remotely operated underwater vehicle rov are two categories of unmanned underwater robotic systems rovs are controlled from the surface generally by a wired connection these can do a variety of tasks but the wired connection limits its manoeuvrability as well as accessibility to remote locations auvs navigate autonomously relying on its navigation algorithm and surrounding information once deployed they collect data and come back to the surface after completion of the predefined task as auvs are not connected to the ground they have high manoeuvrability can travel to remote locations narrow complex pathways involve no human fatigue and operation cost is very less underwater wireless communication has its limitations so auvs have seen an increase in interest from the underwater research community it has always been a challenge to make a robotic device to explore these hostile territories with advancements in auv research materials manufacturing techniques sensors computational power and battery technology autonomous decision making underwater robots have become more reliable and practical a reliable fully autonomous decision making robotic system is the objective of current auv research the first auv spurv the self propelled underwater research vehicle was developed by stan murphy and bob francois in 1957 in the applied physics laboratory at the university of washington remotely operated vehicle committee of the marine technology society spurv operated at 2 2 5 m s up to a depth of 3600 m widditsch 1973 in the 1970s few auvs were developed in mit and also in the soviet union remotely operated vehicle committee of the marine technology society these early underwater robots were bulky expensive and inefficient auvs have come a long way since then the modern day auvs can have six degrees of freedom can travel faster than 20 m s accurately detect obstacles and map ocean floors these are getting compact less expensive yet sophisticated and accessible to the general population for exploration fishing and entertainment etc these systems have yet to go a long way in terms of autonomy till fully autonomous robotic systems help us explore and protect these deep and hazardous habitats auvs have a large number of applications in hazardous underwater environments still auvs have to overcome some limitations to have large scale adoption some of the key challenges are low price underwater wireless communication long lasting batteries advanced manufacturing techniques smart

techniques auvs depend on its propulsion system to travel in the underwater environment bio mimetic auvs mimic propulsion technique as well as body structure of aquatic animals these auvs travel in water using undulatory propulsion in this technique a pressure difference is created in water by moving some part of their body in a wave like pattern most of these auvs use electric motors for this purpose yang et al 2011 parameswaran and selvin 2011 ashar et al 2013 vo et al 2010 choi and lee 2012 yu et al 2016 zhao et al 2008 and jung et al 2013 used servo and dc motors for moving their body

systems are suitable for surveillance and ecological study as they produce no noise and don t disturb the aquatic animals nearby bio mimetic auvs are incapable of carrying heavy payloads and achieving high speed auvs used for these applications generally use multiple propellers or thrusters for propulsion along with rudders and fins for directional control auvs presented in isa and rizal a 2011 alam et al 2014 jun et al 2009 shome and das 2012 hiller et al 2012 ferguson 2009 hyakudome 2011 starfish hong et al 2010 maya national institute of oceanography nio 2012 and aqua explorer 1000 kato

general dynamics mission systems 2012 and auv presented in hung et al 2008 are some examples of such auvs with fixed thrusters kinematics and dynamics relations of different auvs are discussed in the next section 4 kinematics and dynamics kinematic model of a robot is the mathematical correlation between the inertial non inertial frame and links of a robot which defines the position velocity and acceleration of different parts of the robot with respect to some frame of reference dynamic model correlates forces and moments with the position and velocity of the robot a rigid body auv is considered as a single link manipulator and its kinematic model correlates the body fixed frame and the earth fixed frame as shown in fig 4 the body fixed frame is attached to the geometrical centre of the vehicle with axes in the directions of surge sway and heave respectively earth fixed or inertial x y z frame coincides with the north east down directions and fixed to a point on the water surface as presented in table 3 coordinates along x y z axis x y z and rotational angle about these axis ϕ θ ψ constitute the position and orientation vectors of auv centre of gravity c g in the inertial frame presented as η η 1 t η 2 t t where η 1 x y z t η 2 ϕ θ ψ t linear and angular velocity of the auv c g in the body fixed frame is denoted as ν ν 1 t ν 2 t t where ν 1 u ν w t and ν 2 p q r t parameters in both the frames can be correlated using euler transformation presented as 1 η j η 2 ν where j η 2 is the jacobian matrix detailed derivation of the kinematic and dynamic model is presented in fossen 1994 2011 antonelli 2014 an accurate dynamic model is essential for an auv for its control and navigation fossen et al 1995 have presented non linear modelling of a 6 degree of freedom marine vehicles which can be extended for a rigid body auv the interaction between the motion of an auv and different related forces and torques can be expressed as 2 m v c v v d v v g η τ where m m r b m a m r b and m a are the constant inertia and added mass matrix of the auv respectively c ν c r b ν c a ν c r b ν and c a ν are the coriolis and centripetal matrix of the rigid body and the added mass respectively d ν is the damping matrix containing drag and lift terms g η is the vector of restoring forces and moments which includes gravitational and buoyancy forces and τ is the vector of body fixed forces from the actuators hydrodynamic added mass can be interpreted as virtual mass added to a system because when the body accelerates or decelerates it must move some volume of the surrounding fluid as it moves through it added mass matrix m a depends on the shape of the auv m a is positive and symmetrical for submerged bodies different modern tools such as cad modelling and cfd analysis techniques can be used to find close estimates of these above mentioned parameters different system identification techniques have to be employed to accurately measure these system parameters by comparing the simulated results with the experiments weiss et al 2013 presented a method to develop the dynamic model for underwater vehicles in real time by system identification which can be used for position and velocity estimation this method uses recursive least squares estimator to minimise the square of the error between the modelled and measured response to find out the unknown parameters yue et al 2013 presented a dynamic model for the spherical robot sur ii along with parameter estimation to determine the hydrodynamic added mass matrix to the damping matrix here cfd analysis using ansys fluent is used for parameter estimation shen et al 2016 chin et al 2006 allotta et al 2016a ngatini et al 2017 isa and rizal a 2011 hyakudome 2011 shome and das 2012 wang et

vehicles a simplified approach towards the solution of a dynamic model is discussed for various practical applications such as retrieval of objects and repair work etc underwater manipulators are essential work class rovs with remotely operated underwater manipulators are being used for underwater intervention and manipulation works these systems are very expensive because of the requirement of skilled operators high bandwidth communication link and they have to be deployed form the ships with sophisticated control stations apart from these operator fatigue is also a major issue cheaper autonomous intervention systems can effectively replace these expensive manipulator systems such intervention auvs i auvs can be easily deployed from less sophisticated surface vehicles and require less human intervention odin choi et al 1994 and otter wang et al 1995 are some of the first auvs to be equipped with a simple 1 dof robotic arm lane et al 1997 presented the amadeus project for

the first lightweight girona 500 i auv is presented in detail along with its software architecture a detailed discussion on different experimental intervention tasks performed with the i auv such as

simetti et al 2017 presented cooperative manipulation and transportation of an object with multiple i auv simulation results of the mission for grasping transportation and deployment of a long pipe with two i auv is presented i auvs are relatively new and in the future we will be seeing more complex as well as cooperative intervention tasks being carried out by these systems dynamic modelling of auvs with manipulator becomes more complex when the hydrodynamic effect of the manipulator on the auv motion is considered following are some study on the dynamic model of auvs coupled with manipulators and other external accessories wang et al 2016 presented a lightweight multi link manipulator structure for minimising the dynamic coupling between the manipulator and the auv wilson et

an auv and its manipulator system jie and wang 2009 presented an underwater robot with two hanging torpedoes and developed a dynamic model for the robot considering the forces exerted by the torpedoes on the robot generally underwater robots rely on tethered communication the cable affects the dynamics of these vehicles schjolberg et al 1996 presented a dynamic model of a robotic system connected to the ship by a cable a flexible auv such as a robotic fish or snake has a body consisting of multiple links in the case of such auvs kinematic and dynamic modelling becomes more complex the dynamic model of such robots correlates different forces along with the forces generated because of the link movements and the motion of the auv some studies with mathematical modelling of such multi link flexible auvs are presented here yang et al 2011 presented a dynamic model for a 3 joint 4 link robotic fish ashar et al 2013 used different link movement patterns for a different motion of the fish robot kinematic relations have been developed for these movement patterns which are further used in the control system vo et al 2010 choi et al 2012b and yu et al 2016 developed kinematic and dynamic models of their flexible robot for control and navigation auvs have to use different control systems and path planning algorithms for navigation in the highly dynamic underwater environment which are discussed in the following section 4 1 planning and control after the development of an accurate dynamic model one needs to develop a control system for the auv to work properly control system regulates the actuator output to obtain the required velocity and position auv controller has three major operations planning control and error diagnostic depending on the mission objective and environmental constraints path plan is developed control enables the auv to follow this path and replanning is done if some constraint is violated the highly non linear behaviour of auv dynamic underwater environment forces and uncertainties in system parameters are some major challenges faced during the design of a control system for an auv multi link flexible body auvs and additional manipulators add more complexity to the problem auvs to operate in a highly dynamic environment controller gains have to be tuned during auv motion thus adaptive or self tuning controllers are highly desirable but still classic control technique such as pid is commonly used in auvs because of its ease of implementation schjolberg et al 1996 adopted a classical pid control strategy for control of the underwater robot and presented a stability analysis of the system by lyapunov theory a simple pid controller was used by jung et al 2013 to control the motion of a slide slipping fish robot on a flow aided path fittery et al 2012 used a simple pd controller with an onboard gyro sensor for estimation of heading angle of the micro pumps of an egg shaped auv isa and rizal a 2011 developed an open loop controller for a propeller driven underwater glider shome and das 2012 implemented a pid controller for auv 150 wilson et al 2011 presented a pid controller having linearised feedback schillai et al 2016 used a depth pid control along with sonar to evaluate the terrain collision risk associated with auvs used in photographic surveys of sea floor apart from simple controllers researchers have developed some advanced control strategies such as non linear control adaptive control sliding mode control and neural network control to address complex dynamic control problem associated with auvs some of these control methods adapted for auvs are discussed by parhi and kundu 2012 and yuh 2000 hyakudome 2011 used a linear quadratic optimum controller with integral action sarhadi et al 2016 proposed an adaptive pid control with an anti windup compensator for an auv such adaptive control strategies are better equipped to handle variable system parameters xiang et al 2015 developed a control strategy to move an auv along a horizontal path in both fully actuated and under actuated configurations a non linear controller was used for an under actuated auv which was later adopted for the fully actuated system fuzzy controllers based on fuzzy logic are most popular control techniques fuzzy logic is a mathematical system which considers analog inputs in the form of a logical variable which can take continuous values between 0 and 1 this method reduces mathematical complexity kato et al 1994 developed a pid and a fuzzy controller for maintaining the altitude of a cable tracking auv and also discussed the cable tracking experiment with sensors sonar and pid control hung et al 2008 used a hybrid fuzzy pid controller where the incremental fuzzy logic controller is used in place of the proportional term with integral and derivative terms intact yu et al 2016 used two stage control law for posture control of the robotic fish first one is the fast position approach which is a modified proportional control for the fish to swim faster towards the target and the second one is the accurate posture adjusting using a time varying feedback stabilization control for position and directional accuracy here fuzzy logic and behaviour based control were used for coordination of multiple fish robots vo et al 2010 developed the dynamic model of a fish robot

dynamics a dual closed loop integral sliding mode control design is used with an outer loop for velocity estimation and an inner loop for actual control input to actuators for trajectory tracking neural network controllers have gained popularity and seen a large scale adoption in recent years because of exponential advancements in computer infrastructure artificial neural networks are computing systems inspired by a biological neural network with machine learning algorithms for data processing li and lee 2005 designed a neural network adaptive controller for an auv here neural

valve turning operation with learning by demonstration algorithm simetti et al 2017 discussed individual and also cooperative control of multiple uvms for different intervention tasks such as picking up transportation and deployment antonelli 2014 presented a detailed discussion on i auvs and different control strategy for uvms such as feed forward decoupling control feedback linearisation nonlinear control non regressor based adaptive contro and virtual decomposition based control etc along with the control systems certain navigation and localization techniques are essential for the auvs motion which is discussed in section 7 5 navigation and localization auvs navigate underwater autonomously based on predefined strategy localization is a vital component in navigation which helps an auv to follow the predefined path precisely and reach the final destination non availability of global positioning system gps and high frequency radio signals in the underwater environment makes localization and navigation very challenging for auvs maintaining accuracy in auv s position for a long mission is a difficult task accuracy in position deteriorates over time because of variations in auv motion and absence of an external reference therefore over time different innovative methods have been developed to tackle these problems using a combination of numerical technique and real time sensor data as discussed by stutters et al 2008 auv navigation can be broadly classified as inertial navigation inertial navigation uses different sensor data to estimate vehicle s relative velocity and position acceleration rotational speed and magnetic field intensity data are obtained from accelerometer gyroscope and magnetometer sensors respectively these three sensors are part of the inertial measurement unit imu other sensor data such as relative velocity from doppler velocity log dvl sonar positioning data from gps depth data from pressure sensor etc are used to minimise the error in estimated position acoustic navigation acoustic navigation uses multiple acoustic transponders to estimate auv s position using time of flight concept geophysical navigation geophysical navigation uses unique features in the surrounding as a reference to estimate auv s position and navigate different sensors capable of detecting and identifying these features are used auvs are equipped with different sensors which can provide real time quantitative data of the surrounding all these sensor data have to be processed together using some techniques to obtain an optimal estimate of the vehicle position some of those techniques are kalman filters kfs particle filters pfs and simultaneous localization and mapping slam from these techniques kfs and pfs are numerical techniques for sensor fusion these numerical methods are prone to drift over time in slam method localization is achieved by identifying areas of the environment the robot has already passed through stutters et al 2008 and paull et al 2014 discussed different navigation and localization methods in detail 5 1 inertial navigation systems ins calculates relative position and orientation of a dynamic system relative to a known starting point orientation and velocity using the data from motion sensors accelerometers and rotation sensors gyroscopes ins is a compact inexpensive and self contained system which does not require external references therefore it can be used for inexpensive small auvs however ins can accumulate error over time because the estimated relative velocity and position are the result of mathematical integrations of the accelerometer and gyroscopic sensor data errors in the measurement of this sensor data and errors introduced in integration lead to a significant drift in the estimated position and velocity therefore the estimated position from ins needs to be compared with the data from other systems such as depth sensor compass dvl sonar acoustic doppler current profiler adcp sonar for short missions and from gps on long missions depth sensor compass gps costs between 100 and 1000 usd whereas dvl and adcp sonar cost 20k 200k usd a low cost ins set up uses gps but the auv has to resurface in intervals when operating in greater depth resurfacing is not an option auv has to relay on ins with dvl or adcp sonar p suro auv li et al 2010 used an ins system along with depth sensor sonar and vision system with kalman filter for navigation thompson et al 2012a used kearfott inertial navigation system ins in their mapping auv shome and das 2012 used ekf with ins and dvl for navigation of auv 150 ashar et al 2013 used an ins using a 10 dof imu for a fish robot tal et al 2017 proposed a navigation system for small auv using ins and dvl fusion with partial dvl measurement 5 2 acoustic navigation systems the range is estimated from the time of travel of the acoustic signal for localization some of the popular acoustic navigation systems are ultra short baseline usbl auv is localized relative to a surface vehicle fitted with an array of acoustic transducers fig 6 a relative distance is calculated from the time of travel of the acoustic signal and direction from the phase difference of the signal received by different transducers here the transducers are placed close to one another and major disadvantages is the range the time delay in acoustic communication can cause an error in localization xiao et al 2017 proposed a time delay compensation approach for multi auv cooperative navigation with an ultra short baseline acoustic positioning system short baseline sbl here the transducers are placed in front and back of the surface vehicle fig 6 b thus the baseline is limited to the length of the vehicle which limits the positional accuracy of the auv long baseline lbl in this case the transducers are widely placed over the mission area on the seabed localization is done by triangulating the range estimated by acoustic transducers the major limitation is the huge cost and time involved in placing the transducers on the seabed siddiqui et al 2015 used lbl acoustic ranging sound speed profile was shown to affect acoustic localization and such environmental parameters were considered for effective path planning gps intelligent buoys gibs limitation of lbl can be eliminated by putting transducers with gps buoys on the surface fig 6 c two way communication is used between the auv and gibs the ranges are estimated by using two way travel time of the acoustic signal single transponder to minimise the cost single transponders can be used instead of multiple systems here the baseline is simulated by extending the range with time until the next signal is received straight trajectory towards or away from the transponder results in large positional errors for this case trajectories tangent to the transponder is ideal crasta et al 2015 presented an observability study of an auv with a single transponder in the presence of ocean current using depth measurement and range from the transponder data acoustic modem with these modems information can be transmitted along with the signal used for range estimation using time of flight therefore the transponders need not be fixed and located in the global frame before starting the mission this navigation technique can be used for cooperative navigation with multi auv systems a cooperative localization technique using a minimum of three auv by a tetrahedral geometric method is proposed by allotta et al 2014 three auvs were equipped with cheap ins modules but one had dvl whose benefits were extended by using acoustic communication towards cooperative localization munafo et al 2014 included time information in the acoustic signal which helped in improving auv localization using underwater acoustic sensor networks some of the commercially available acoustic modems are presented in table 4 tang et al 2019 studied a positioning method for auvs in arctic seawater using an electromagnetic field it uses direction of arrival triangulation based on the polarization of near field from three nodes auv estimates its position by comparing the polarized field obtained from three monochromatic sources with different frequencies 5 3 geophysical navigation external environmental features are used as landmarks for localization optical and sonar are the two major categories for geophysical navigation slam is predominantly used for this navigation 5 3 1 optical monocular or stereo cameras can be used to take images of the underwater environment and features extracted from the images can be used for slam visual odometry technique uses dual camera set up for relative velocity and orientation estimation from images captured negahdaripour et al 1991 described a method for orientation and motion estimation using optical sensor and illustrated some examples with real images hildebrandt and kirchner 2010 presented a visual odometry algorithm using stereo vision setup and data from an inertial measurement unit to be used in a slam system calibration is a major problem for visual odometry techniques kunz et al 2010 presented a system for recovering the 7 dof relationship between the auv s estimation frame and the camera rig in order to produce a self calibrated stereo vision setup for sea floor mapping this led to a detailed 3d reconstruction of the underwater structures p suro auv presented by li et al 2010 used an underwater vision system for localization and path planning during the vision test the

low cost sensor for velocity and incremental pose estimation for auv in this work libviso2 and fovis two visual odometry algorithms are used during the experimentation carrasco et al 2015 presented the integration of a stereo vision graph slam system in the navigation and control architecture of the auv sparus ii and showed improvement in localization compared with the fusion of dvl pressure sensor gps and imu sensors with ekf perez et al 2015 presented a benchmarking process used for easy comparison and replication of the results of two 3 d reconstruction algorithms in simulated and real scenarios sukvichai et al 2016 successfully implemented a visual odometry estimation algorithm into the single board computer raspberrypi 2 with the robot operating system ros lin et al 2017 developed a 3d reconstruction method using the laser line scan technique using a binocular stereo vision camera for obstacle avoidance for the auv liu et al 2019 presented a short range vision based docking

allibert et al 2019 presented a vision based non linear control technique for pipeline following fully actuated auv apart from kinematics full system dynamics have been considered for stability analysis the proposed system was demonstrated with a fully actuated girona 500 auv dark underwater environment scattering of light low visibility range are some major challenges for underwater vision systems lu et al 2017 discussed the issues related to the underwater vision such as poor visibility due to the medium scattering and light distortion and its solution using computer vision recent trends of ocean exploration approaches using optical imaging sensors and computer vision were also discussed hoth et al 2017 proposed a colour reconstruction of underwater images with machine learning so that vision systems can be used for underwater slam cho et al 2018 proposed visibility enhancement technique for visual slam in a turbid environment in most of the auvs object detection systems uses sonar expensive sonar systems can be replaced with optical sensors for object detection in case of small scale auvs advancement in compact high quality cameras techniques such as computer vision and artificial intelligence vision systems have become more reliable over time 5 3 2 sonar sonars are most preferable sensors for underwater mapping and being used for such applications from ages sonars can be used to detect and identify different underwater structural features to be used for navigation imaging sonars produces bathymetric information as a black and white image with hard rocks being dark with maximum reflection and mud lighter with less reflection multi beam bathymetry sonars used for ocean floor mapping by detecting sound reflected back from the sea floor by the multiple arrays of traducers with time delay after processing this information water depth is determined and bathymetric map is developed which can be used for terrain aided navigation tan morice et al 2009 developed a terrain aided navigation correction system for auv here drift was measured by comparing the bathymetric data from the multi beam sonar and previously collected reference map ferguson 2009

robust bathymetric slam bslam to properly estimate inter frame motion and avoid invalid loop closers the algorithm is verified with experimental data set 5 4 state estimator as discussed above kalman filters kfs particle filters pfs and simultaneous localization and mapping slam are some of the popular state estimators used for auv localization with available sensor data kfs and pfs commonly used with ins and acoustic navigation whereas slam with geophysical navigation kalman filter kf is used to derive the best estimate of position from different sensors used the kf estimates the state of a system from multiple uncertain observations using a predict update cycle a physical model describing auv motion can be highly non linear where the kf fails in such a non linear model case an extended kalman filter ekf can be used ekf uses a first order taylor series to approximate the nonlinear processes xiaoping yun et al 2000 developed an ins navigation system for small auv using low cost imu and gps unit an asynchronous kalman filter is used to improve position estimation allotta et al 2012 choi et al 2012a used ekf for auv localization font et al 2016 developed a navigation system with

compared with ekf and observed to reduce localization errors ngatini et al 2017 presented position estimation of auv based on the dynamic model using the ensemble kalman filter enkf and the fuzzy kalman filter fkf and shown that enkf is better in estimating the trajectory of dynamic equation of auv motion choi and lee 2012 proposed an effective movement for the navigation of the fish like robot using the heuristic method kinsey et al 2014 presented a system to estimate the position and velocity of an rov for the navigation using a non linear dynamic model here ekf and non linear observer nlo methods were used for position estimation and it is observed that nlo performed better than kf shao et al 2016 used an adaptive ekf for auv navigation allotta et al 2016a b used unscented kalman filter ukf for auv navigation and presented a comparative study with ekf approach jung et al 2013 presented a navigation strategy for an auv in a flowing medium a biomimetic robot moving in uniform flow using a side slipping manoeuvre was used to showcase the stability of the proposed strategy an accurate dynamic model of auvs are essential for navigation but the error in parameter estimation and some unknown parameters introduce error in navigation shariati et al 2019 proposed a method to estimate the non linear dynamic model of the auv using pf combined with ekf simulated results by the estimated model are compared with the experimental results to validate the model navigation algorithms can also be target specific such as tracking oil spill gas leakage or underwater communication cables etc in these cases different visual and chemical makeup sensors data are incorporated in the navigation algorithm to track these specific targets kimura et al 2013 described the guidance control simulation for designing the underwater robot sotab that tracks oil spill autonomously and gathers oceanographic data numerical simulation was adopted to estimate the manoeuvrability of this robot to compute the hydrodynamic derivatives of the robot usaf datcom method and cfd were used kato et al 1994 presented an autonomous underwater robot aqua explorer 1000 ae1000 used for inspection of underwater telecommunication cables ael000 can find and track buried underwater cables with a cable tracking sensor and the underwater footage of the sea floor is saved on a built in video cassette recorder vcr among the three navigation systems ins is suitable for low cost small scale auvs for short missions and long missions with gps where resurfacing is allowed acoustic navigation is costlier with better accuracy this need transponders to be fitted to support surface vehicles gps buoys or to be placed on the seabed which are time consuming process and before starting each operation the transponders has to be referred globally these limitations can be eliminated by using acoustic modems acoustic modems are suitable for cooperative navigation when existing information of the environment is available such as repetitive routine operations geophysical navigation can be utilised with low cost optical sensors or high precision costlier sonar sensors and different slam techniques 5 5 path planning with object detection and obstacle avoidance navigation algorithm must incorporate object detection and obstacle avoidance mechanism so that the auv does not collide with objects in the underwater environment and damage itself these systems are used for path planning to find an optimal and suboptimal path for navigation navigation algorithms can be deterministic non deterministic or hybridization of both called evolutionary algorithm navigation can be global or local in global navigation prior knowledge of the environment must be available in case of local navigation auv decides and controls its motion and orientation using the available sensor data such as sonar infrared range finder lasers acoustic sensors and stereo vision cameras path planning is simply a multobjective optimization procedure with an objective to reduce travel time shorten path length with safety and smooth trajectory path planning algorithm must quickly adapt to the changing underwater environment and select trajectory based on the surrounding information avoiding obstacles with either minimum time or energy use 3d optimal path planning is essential for auvs but large scale 3d optimization problem has a high computational requirement different optimization algorithm has been developed to address these problems but still more research is required towards the development of auv path planning systems to be used in the highly dynamic underwater environment li et al 2019 presented a detailed review of different path planning techniques used for auvs

robot vision and experimentally verified the system in turbid water section 9 highlights the different communication systems used by auvs 5 6 underwater communication most of the underwater robotic systems rely on tethered communication using lan coaxial or fibre optic cables these cable brings hydrodynamic instability to the auv increases drag and also limits its manoeuvrability and accessibility wireless underwater communication with high speed high volume data is still a major challenge researchers have experimented with different modes of communication for this purpose such as low and high frequency radio acoustic and laser communication vk5br 1987 presented a study on underwater radio communication along with its limitations and solutions shaneyfelt et al 2008 described

system using zigbee protocol and successfully tested its performance acoustic waves are most commonly used underwater communication method employed nowadays because of the lower attenuation in sea water commercial acoustic underwater wireless communication modems are available for low bit rate data transfer the low data rate delay in communication and high energy requirement are some of the disadvantages of the acoustic communication high attenuation in conducting salt water limits the use of high frequency radio waves and low frequency radio waves can be used in shallow waters constant requirement of high data rate low energy consumption gave rise to optical light based communication and hybrid acoustic radio frequency rf communication technique saini et al 2017 presented an analytical study showing the use of radio waves for deep water communication by using an acoustic signal as a complementary part soomro et al 2018 presented an underwater network control system with a

auvs are discussed along with few examples which show the usefulness of the underwater robotic systems different aspects of an auv such as structural design and analysis propulsion dynamics control navigation localization path planning and communication are presented in detail current developments and limitations in the field of auvs are discussed below this will provide an overview of possible research directions auvs can be found in various shapes and sizes from large scale torpedo shaped submersibles jun et al 2009 shome and das 2012 ferguson 2009 hiller et al 2012 hyakudome 2011 hong et

generally large scale auvs dominate this space most of these bulky expensive auvs are difficult to deploy and operate require a lot of energy and can not be used in narrow pathways over the years form factor of computers controllers and sensors have been reduced which can help reduce the size of the auvs significantly till date compact small scale auvs are rare and most of them are bio mimetic auvs these bio mimetic auvs are silent in operation can integrate well into the natural habitat therefore they are mostly used for survey and monitoring purpose in recent years soft and flexible materials have been used to develop lifelike bio mimetic auvs katzschmann et al 2018 such auvs can effortlessly integrate into the habitat and therefore used for close observation of aquatic life however these robots are slow and have very less load carrying capacity a host of research can be done towards the development of compact hybrid auvs with bio inspired aquatic structures and powerful thrusters with ever increasing computational power techniques like cfd and constantly upgrading sophisticated cad modelling software like solidworks and finite element analysis software like ansys researchers can come up with auvs with shape optimized hydrofoil profiles nguyen et al 2018 sun et al 2017 alam et al 2014 to increase efficiency and decrease drag and other unbalancing forces the auv designs can incorporate more bio mimetic components to further increase the efficiency such complex designs can become reality using sophisticated 3d printing techniques composite kang et al 2018 smart and functionally graded materials with higher strength energy harvesting ability have not much used in auvs investigation in this direction can help in increasing the efficiency which will enhance the range of operation in terms of time and distance compact micro robots and bio mimetic auvs can find large applications in surveillance and reconnaissance use of different system identification techniques and sophisticated cad modelling software have enabled researchers to develop accurate dynamic models for the highly non linear dynamic behaviour of the auvs using accurate dynamic models better control systems can be designed increase in the accuracy of the dynamic model increases its complexity and they have become highly non linear apart from simple pid controllers schjolberg et al

li et al 2017 adaptive sarhadi et al 2016 and neural network wang et al 2014 li and lee 2005 controllers have been developed to handle the non linear models more research has to be carried out for developing adaptive controllers suitable for auvs operating in the dynamic underwater environment different innovative navigation methods have been developed over time to have better localization in the underwater environment in the absence of gps and external references from these methods ins is best suited for small scale auvs with short range mission and accuracy can be improved by using dvl sonar stereo vision and other sensors with imu for long missions auvs have to resurface to use gps generally practical and kalman filters are used to estimate the best position using these multiple sensor data in last decade modified kalman filters such as ekf allotta et al 2012 choi et al 2012a font et al 2016 shome and das 2012 asynchronous kf xiaoping yun et al 2000 ensemble kf ngatini et al

beacons for repetitive mission on a small locality different slam carrasco et al 2015 hildebrandt and kirchner 2010 techniques can be used as in this system auvs map the surroundings in each pass and use this information for localization cooperative navigation with multi auvs allotta et al 2014 xiao et al 2017 can help extend the benefit of one auv s hardware capabilities to others sonar and optical sensors with hybrid ekf slam can further minimise localization errors i auvs have seen significant development in the last few years such autonomous manipulator systems can effectively replace costly and complex semi autonomous and manual intervention missions these systems are in the early stage and need significant research towards the development of fully autonomous systems for complex intervention tasks current research in this field showcased simple intervention task such as self ducking palomeras et al 2016 valve turning carrera et al 2014 search and retrieval of a target object prats et al 2012 sanz et al 2013 and cooperative transportation of payload to ocean floor simetti et al 2017 etc 3d optimal path planning with obstacle avoidance is essential for an auv path planning algorithm must quickly adapt to the dynamic underwater environment various evolutionary optimization algorithm such as genetic algorithm particle swarm optimization and quantum behaved particle swarm optimization has been used for auv path planning graph search schemes fast marching and level set method artificial potential field and rapidly exploring random tree are some of the other optimization methods used for auv path planning evolutionary algorithms are better suited to handle dynamic environments most of the auvs used 2d path planning to avoid the high computational requirement more research has to be carried out towards the development of 3d optimal path planning algorithms for trajectory selection of auvs operating in an unpredictable underwater environment generally in auvs sonars chew et al 2013 jacobi 2015 with different selection algorithms such as fuzzy abbasi et al 2010 choi et al 2012b sigmoid neuro fuzzy xiao et al 2007 are used for object detection and avoidance other such systems are laser gated ranging system he and seet 2001 infrared range finder and acoustic sensors munafo et al 2014 siddiqui et al 2015 for compact low cost auvs such expensive systems can be replaced with vision systems but it always has challenges in the underwater environment such as low visibility turbidity and light distortion which decreases the efficiency of the systems underwater techniques like computer vision lu et al 2017 can be used to overcome some limitations more research and development in computer vision neural network and image recognition hardware and software will encourage the development of less expensive object detection obstacle avoidance lin et al 2017 and visual odometry systems hildebrandt and kirchner 2010 sukvichai et al 2016 these systems coupled with ins wirth et al 2013 li et al 2010 can be used for accurate localization and mapping li et al 2010 compact high precision sensors can provide quantitative information of the surrounding which will help navigate these uncertain dynamic underwater environments data intensive wireless underwater communication is still a challenge low frequency acoustic signals are being used for communication with the data transfer rate in the kbps range and average transmission range of 1 2 km the requirement of high data rate and low energy consumption encouraged researchers to revisit rf communications wireless optical communication oubei et al 2018 sharifzadeh et al 2018 and hybrid acoustic and rf communication soomro et al 2018 are some of the new trends in this field compact modems with high speed and long range data transfer will play an important role in long range auv missions 7 conclusion a critical review on auvs has been carried out considering the past literature in the present review investigation a detailed study of auvs with applications and different research aspects such as structural design and analysis propulsion dynamics control navigation localization path planning and communication are discussed in recent times autonomous underwater manipulator system has gained its popularity because of its cost effective and simplified solution towards various intervention tasks cooperative manipulation and navigation with multi auvs systems can bring functional solutions to various underwater challenges such cooperative systems require high data rate and energy efficient wireless communication systems which can be realised with optical hybrid rf and acoustic communication compact efficient auv structures better adaptive control techniques using fuzzy logic and neural networking accurate localization using improved ins with non linear kalman filters cooperative aquatics localization slam etc 3d optimal path planning with obstacle avoidance low cost vision systems with ai and computer vision for object detection and odometry and underwater wireless communication are some of the topics which require attention from research community a few years back underwater robotic systems were very expensive and bulky with the development of affordable manufacturing techniques like 3d printing cheap one board computers like raspberrypi underwater robots are becoming popular in the scientific community affordable underwater drones such as trident by openrov and powerray by powervision have come to commercial space and become accessible to students small industries these drones are tethered and manually controlledstill such systems can create research interest in young minds improvement in sensors high density batteries energy harvesting techniques high strength materials highspeed wireless underwater communication artificial intelligence computer vision neural network adaptive control improved localization will help towards the development of long range fully autonomous underwater robots which can explore deepest corners of the oceans
