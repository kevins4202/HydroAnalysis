13880,zero valent scrap iron zvsi combined with fenton based oxidation reaction reduction oxidation process was studied under natural sunlight conditions to degrade a mixture of six pharmaceuticals zvsi is a waste product from metalworking industries which present excellent reactivity the morphological and structural properties of zvsi were evaluated using different techniques the parent compounds and their transformation products tps were monitored using liquid chromatographic coupled with quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometer lc qtof ms the in silico quantitative structure activity relationship q sar predictions of toxicity and biodegradability were predicted for each tp by using different freely available models according the characterization zvsi consisted mainly of carbon 48 5 and iron 43 6 with 0 6922 m2 g of surface area hematite and magnetite were the main crystalline phases zvsi doehlert design and desirability profile were used to select the experimental conditions higher degradation rates were achieved at ph 3 0 32 5 mg l 1 h2o2 and 2 g l 1 zvsi under the optimal conditions pharmaceuticals removal was as high as 87 in all matrixes evaluated following a pseudo first order kinetic model behavior three reuse cycles were performed using real hospital wastewater rhww achieving degradation percentages 70 and no substantial variation in the crystalline phases of the zvsi was observed twenty three tps were detected according to in silico q sar predictions the integrated system decreased the toxicity of tps moreover most of tps were predicted as persistent compounds the results indicated that zvsi combined with solar fenton based oxidation is an interesting alternative for the degradation of pharmaceuticals in rhww allowing the reuse of catalyst keywords reduction oxidation process pharmaceuticals degradation transformation products toxicity biodegradability 1 introduction brazil is one of the countries that has substantial iron ore reserves 1 zero valent scrap iron zvsi a waste product from metalworking industries possesses excellent reactivity similar to zero valent iron zvi but is available at a very low price the replacement of zvi by zvsi in processes can decrease the overall costs and also provide a use for scrap iron 2 however few studies have explored the advantages of this material 2 4 zvi has been successfully applied for the treatment of water and wastewater contain pharmaceuticals 5 zvi is a reactive metal with standard redox potential e0 0 44 v therefore it is an effective reducer when it reacts with contaminants containing carbonyl nitro and azo groups such as pharmaceuticals the mechanism of elimination of contaminants by zvi via reduction refers to the directional transfer of electrons from zvi to the contaminants eq 1 6 reduction of carbonyl compounds generates alcohol derivatives whereas nitro and azo reductions lead to amino derivatives sometimes the hydroxyl and amino moieties are much more susceptible to degradation than other functional groups commonly present in some parent compounds 5 meanwhile when the system is in the presence of dissolved oxygen do there can be corrosion of zvi and in situ generation of h2o2 eq 2 5 moreover zvi is oxidized by two electron transfer in the presence of h2o2 under the acidic conditions eq 3 7 the release of fe2 ions in zvi h2o2 systems is known as the fenton reaction which can produce hydroxyl radicals ho that have a strong oxidizing capacity e0 2 8 v 8 towards a variety of organic compounds this oxidation of contaminants can be through i a homogeneous fenton mechanism ii heterogeneous reaction inducedor iii the synergic action of both mechanisms 9 1 fe0 fe2 2e 2 fe0 o2 2h fe2 h2o2 3 fe0 h2o2 2h fe2 2h2o on the other hand most of the studies using zvi for the degradation of pharmaceuticals analyzed the degradation of a single compound in water or simulated effluents 5 however complex matrixes like raw hospital wastewater rhww or wastewater treatment plants wwtp are known to contain a large variety of pharmaceuticals 10 in different concentrations 11 consequently the study of mixtures of pharmaceutical compounds in real matrixes is necessary to have greater precision regarding the effectiveness of the treatment when zvi is used for degradation of pharmaceuticals which are present as complex mixtures in wastewater different degradation pathways are generated leading to the formation of intermediates called transformation products tps whose presence and amounts can vary depending on the matrix and the treatment employed 12 the presence of pharmaceuticals and tps can lead to synergistic and or antagonistic effects 13 it has in turn an environmental outcomes the assessment of environmental fate and effects could to avoid or reduce their environmental and human health impacts combining analytical techniques such as lc qtof ms and in silico quantitative structure activity relationship q sar predictions tools are powerful approaches for a proactive assessment of environmental fate and toxicity this combination can provide a strong indication about the tps that may have adverse effects enabling the proposal of the most appropriate conditions and the types of treatment that could provide total removal of tps 14 15 the goal of this work was to evaluate the degradation of a mixture of pharmaceuticals in real hospital wastewater rhww employing zvsi as a source of the iron species required in a combined reduction oxidation process degradation pathways were proposed for pharmaceutical degradation together with in silico q sar predictions of the toxicities and biodegradabilities of the proposed tps 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and aqueous matrixes standards of paracetamol pct propranolol ppn dipyrone dip fluoxetine fxt diazepam dzp and progesterone prg analytical grade purity 90 were used for the degradation study a mixed stock solution was prepared at a concentration of 14 g l 1of each of target compounds in acetonitrile methanol 2 1 v v dilutions of the stock solution were prepared at the initial concentrations of 500 μg l 1 of each pharmaceutical compounds for the degradation experiments the three aqueous matrixes employed were distilled water dw simulated wastewater sww and raw hospital wastewater rhww the composition of the sww was adapted from the oecd recommendation 16 consisted of peptone 160 mg l 1 beef extract 110 mg l 1 urea 30 mg l 1 mg2so4 7h2o 2 mg l 1 and cacl2 2h2o 4 mg l 1 the characteristics of the rhww can be seen in the table 1 the rhww employed in the degradation studies was used as collected without filtration the pharmaceutical compounds were spiked into the different aqueous matrixes prior to ph adjustment 2 2 characterization of the zvsi granulometric powder x ray diffraction xrd scanning electron microscopy sem eds mapping brunauer emmett teller bet surface area sbet and the point of zero charge were analyzed more information about the characterization can be seen in text s 1 supplementary material 2 3 experimental design of the reduction oxidation process doehlert design was used for optimization of the variables in the reduction oxidation table s 2 1 supplementary material batch experiments were performed using a solar photo reactor 1 l equipped with an aeration system providing agitation the zvsi was added to the photo reactor containing the initial mixture of pharmaceuticals in the dark and was left for 15 min after this time h2o2 39 w v was added to the photo reactor which was then exposed to sunlight the initial ph was adjusted to 3 0 using h2so4 0 5 mol l 1 the experiment was carried out at chemistry institute of universidade federal do rio grande do sul rs brazil latitude 30 4 21 0864 s longitude 51 7 11 838 w using natural sunlight irradiation on a sunny day around noon natural solar uv radiation was measured using a solar energy meter sp 2000 icel which provides data in terms of incident radiation w m 2 to facilitate the comparison with other photocatalytic experiments the normalized illumination time t30w 17 was used instead of exposition time t 2 4 reuse experiments the reuse experiments of zvsi were performed in rhww matrix under the same experimental conditions after the first set of experiments the zvsi was separated by centrifugation washed at least three times with ultrapure water and dried at 60 c for 2 h the washed material was employed in three successive experiments 2 5 analytical determinations the iron speciation and h2o2 residual were determined by 1 10 phenanthroline and hydroquinone 18 and nh4vo3 19 methods using a cary 50 uv vis spectrophotometer mineralization was monitored by measuring the doc of the rhww samples with direct injection of the filtered 0 45 μm pvdf membrane samples into a shimadzu toc l csh analyzer 2 6 lc qtof ms instrumentation the pharmaceuticals and their tps were monitored and quantified using a liquid chromatograph nexera x2 shimadzu connected to a qtof mass spectrometer impact ii bruker daltonics further details are provided in text s 3 supplementary material identification of the tps was carried out by constructing a purpose built database with tps reported in the literature including over 175 compounds this database was updated from previous work 20 each tp was assigned with a number and the acronym of the pharmaceutical from which it originated 2 7 in silico predictions of biodegradability and toxicological risk of the tps predictions of biodegradability and ecotoxicity of pharmaceuticals and their tps were made by in silico q sar tools toxtreev 13 0 21 and epi suite biowin 1 7 software from us epa 22 were used to estimate biodegradability persistence and oral toxicity while acute and chronic toxicities were estimated using ecological structure activity relationships ecosar v 2 0 software from us epa 23 the lc50 ratio mg l 1 was calculated dividing lc50 or ec50 fish 96 h daphnid 48 h and green algae 96 h of each tp for the respective values of its parent compound 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the zvsi fig 1 a shows a histogram of the zvsi particle size distribution 85 in the size range 1 2 0 3 mm and 47 corresponding to tyler mesh size 28 0 6 mm for more information table s 1 1 supplementary material according with bet surface area analysis the zvsi has a 0 6922 m2 g with a micropore volume of 2 39 103 cm3 g and 4 13 nm of micropore width the xrd of the zvsi fig 1b showed peaks at 2θ of 27 45 55 65 and 83 the narrow and intense peaks located at 27 and 45 evidenced the crystalline character of the material the xrd crystallographic library data enabled the identification of two phases according to icsd inorganic crystal structure database card 31829 the peaks at 27 and 55 were of graphitic carbon while based on icsd card 64999 the peaks at 45 65 and 83 corresponded to zvi similar results were obtained by shaibani and ghambari 2011 24 the average crystallite size was calculated using the scherrer equation eq 3 3 d k λ β c o s θ where k is the scherrer constant 0 91 β is the width at half height λ is the wavelength of the radiation 0 15406 nm and θ is the bragg angle values of 56 2 and 25 1 nm were obtained for the graphitic carbon and metallic iron respectively the layered image obtained using sem fig 1c showed a little of surface oxidation onto the material the particles presented irregular edges rough surfaces and were deformed because mechanical machining processes generated them at higher magnification fig 1d small pores could be seen onto surface indicating that the material could act as an adsorbent the energy dispersive spectrometry eds technique showed the presence of the elements fe c o si cr mn and ca fig 1e carbon and iron presented the highest percentages 48 5 and 43 6 respectively the hydrated surface of zvsi in aqueous solution could be ph dependent the effect of ph on the surface charge is characterized by the isoelectric point iep fig s 4 1 supplementary material shows the zeta potential of the zvsi particles as a function of solution ph the iep was found to be near ph 7 0 while increasing the ph the zvsi particles acquired an outer layer of iron oxide at the surface where ligands could be adsorbed the adsorption of anions decreases the iep once more protons are needed to neutralize the negative charges of the adsorbed anionic species 25 at ph 3 0 the zvsi presented a positive surface charge of 16 63 mv which could be explained by transfer of fe2 fe3 to the solution and the formation of dimers of fe2o3 nh2o on the surface as the ph was changed the species formed on the surface of the zvsi also changed as shown by charge variations 3 2 optimization of the experimental conditions using a doehlert design preliminary studies were carried out in the dark using the zvsi with agitation for 60 min using an aeration system fig s 4 2 supplementary material the results revealed greater degradation of the pharmaceuticals in the system when aeration was applied zvi air zvi air promotes the coexistence of reduction adsorption and oxidation reactions due to h2o2 formation in an acidic medium by the reaction of zvi with o2 26 this result is in accordance with xiong et al 2015 27 who indicated the degradation capacity of zvi could be improved by air aeration according to the core shell model 28 the shell consists of iron oxides hydroxides formed by the oxidation of zvsi and the oxide film provides sites for chemical reactions zvsi can serve as an electron donor eq 1 and pharmaceuticals accept the electrons and undergo reducing reaction first the pharmaceutical according to its charge is easily adsorbed in zvsi to a favorable reaction site and then the electrons are then transferred from the zvsi to the molecule of pharmaceutical although the reduction of pharmaceuticals occurs on the surface of zvsi h2o2 can also be generated in situ from zvsi and initiate oxidative degradation of pharmaceuticals under acidic conditions eq 2 29 while reaction presented in eq 1 is dominant in fe2 generation the reaction presented in eq 2 controls the generation of fe2 ions in the presence of dissolved oxygen do 30 and promotes the fenton reaction in the zvsi air water matrix in the darkness yuan et al 2016 31 proved that zvi could intensify fenton process the highest primary elimination of pharmaceuticals occurred in the first 15 min so this time was established as the contact time of zvsi with the pharmaceuticals solution in the dark after which the solar photo fenton process was immediately started with addition of h2o2 doehlert design quadratic model was applied to optimize the experimental conditions of zvsi g l 1 and h2o2 mg l 1 at ph 3 0 in a dw matrix nine experiments were performed and the analytical response was reported as the percentage decrease of the summed peak areas of the pharmaceuticals 1 σ at a0 100 after t30w 25 2 min table s 2 1 the highest degradations rates were found in the experiments 5 98 36 and 6 99 06 analysis of variance anova table s 2 2 supplementary material and the f test provided the statistical significance within a 95 confidence interval confirming that the quadratic model could explain 97 57 of the variance the pareto chart of the effects fig s 2 2 shows that the variables zvsi and h2o2 and the square of the zvsi are considered statistically important for treatment furthermore the pareto chart of effects shows that although zvsi and h2o2 have a positive effect on treatment the quadratic interaction term has an antagonist effect confirming the results shown in the desirability profile fig s 2 1 supplementary material the desirability profile from 0 0 undesirable to 1 0 very desirable provided indication of the optimum experimental conditions the h2o2concentration showed desirability value of 1 0 in the range from 32 5 to 64 mg l 1 intermediate concentration level whereas for zvsi was 2 g maximum amount evaluated accordingly ph 3 0 32 5 mg l 1of h2o2 and 2 g zvsi were selected for the subsequent experiments in order to confirm the effectiveness of these conditions experiments 5 and 6 were performed in sww matrix a matrix containing high organic matter content similar to the rhww matrix and more complex than dw higher degradation rates were achieved in experiment 6 compared to experiment 5 with values of 94 59 and 87 48 respectively confirming the correct selection of the experimental conditions 3 3 degradation of pharmaceutical compounds in different aqueous matrixes the solar driven zvsi oxidation process was carried out for t30w 53 9 min using the dw sww andrhww matrixes under the optimized conditions described above the results showed that dip presented the highest degradation rates in the three matrixes in the darkness step furthermore fxt dzp and prg were more persistent throughout the process in dw fig 2 a however it can be mentioned that acidic conditions mainly remove most pharmaceuticals through an oxidation reaction to analyze the interaction of the pharmaceuticals with the zvsi the distribution of each pharmaceutical microspecies in function of ph was calculated using chemicalize org by chemaxon 32 fig s 5 1 supplementary material the pharmaceuticals studied were calculated neutrally charged at ph 3 0 with the exception of dip negatively charged influencing the adsorption onto zvsi compared to other pharmaceuticals adsorption favors the transfer of electrons from the zvsi to the dip therefore producing reduction reactions 30 the alkene moiety present in the pyrazolone ring and the substituents from dip is more susceptible to protonation the structure of the products is determined by the site of protonation of the radical anion intermediate formed after the first electron transfer step 34 subsequently the generated ho iron corrosion products represent the oxidation and adsorption ability which is influenced by solution ph 35 in oxidation process the molecules can undergo aromatic ring openings and hydroxylation for more information see section 3 6 preliminary studies were performed considering desorption of dip in acidic and basic solutions as well as in organic solvents such as methanol and ethanol however due to the strong adsorption of dip and its possible reduction onto zvsi it was not possible to calculate the amount of dip adsorbed on the other hand pct fxt dzp and prg were identified at the end of the treatment in both sww and rhww matrixes fig 2c and e table 1 shows the final concentrations of the pharmaceuticals in the different matrixes studied the results showed that the complexity of the matrix decreased the efficiency of the solar process the zvsi capacity for adsorption of dip and degradation of pharmaceuticals decreased in sww and rhww matrixes which could be explained by the ionic effects caused by the phosphate chloride and sulfate ions occupy active sites and form strong complexes onto zvi surface 36 this behavior was also observed by springer et al 2016 37 where lower dip adsorption was associated with increases in the concentrations of ligands such as phosphate or sulfate suggesting that the dip adsorption mechanism was influenced by the formation of complexes between the internal sphere and metal ions on the particle surface lai et al 38 confirmed the formation of a passive film on the surface of zvi granular activated carbon consisting of inorganic ions i e feso4 fepo4and fe3 po4 2 in the wastewater treatment which decreased the degradation efficiency on the other hand organic matter adsorbs on the catalyst surfaces providing strong steric repulsive forces that oppose the attractive zvsi magnetic interactions 39 natural organic matter is a common scavenger of reactive radicals and humic acids can significantly restrict the elimination of pharmaceuticals in the zvsi system 40 the initial ph 3 0 accelerated corrosion of the zvsi releasing more fe2 into the solutions bulk final concentrations of fe2 9 30 mg l 1 in dw 10 24 mg l 1 in sww 9 75 mg l 1 in rhww compared to fe3 final concentrations of fe3 0 78 mg l 1 in dw 0 34 mg l 1 in sww 0 52 mg l 1 in rhww fig 2b d and f the zvsi acted as a continuous source of dissolved iron into the solution with a predominance of fe2 which in turn contributed to the homogeneous fenton reaction after the treatment the ph increased to final values of 4 0 3 8 and 3 6 in the dw sww and rhww respectively the increase in ph could reflect the contribution of fe2 in a fenton reaction forming ho and ho such behavior was reported by segura et al 2013 41 who evaluated the capacity of the zvi h2o2 system for the wastewaters treatment with different organic amounts in the present work h2o2 consumption was 25 8 mg l 1in dw while in sww and rhww h2o2 was complete consumed successive h2o2 additions were employed to improve the degradation efficiency for this purpose h2o2 was added for four times t30w 0 4 5 9 2 and 13 9 min at a concentration of 8 13 mg l 1 the results obtained fig 2g and 2 h showed that there maining concentration of the parent compounds were lower than single addition table 2 h2o2 was completely consumed and 12 16 mg l 1 of total dissolved iron released into the solutions these results were in agreement with the work of hinojosa guerra et al 2019 42 who used successive additions of h2o2 in a solar photo fenton process for the degradation of pct and amoxicillin in synthetic wastewater and real effluent from a treatment plant achieving degradation rates of 90 and 80 respectively high mineralization rates were obtained using successive h2o2 additions 29 60 compared to a single addition 19 90 these results indicate that successive additions of h2o2 minimized the effect of hydroxyl radical scavengers and preserved the catalytic activity of zvsi decreasing the formation of hydroxides that could inhibit electron transport 3 4 degradation kinetics usually photo fenton process follows a pseudo first order kinetic 43 44 most of the experiments were fitted by the linear behavior of ln c c0 vs t30w r2 0 99 due to competitive matrix effects tps formed and changes in ph 45 other kinetic models were used the model proposed by chan and chu 2003 46 considered two stages of degradation i rapid and indicative of high reactivity and ii slow kinetic characterized by a smaller slope table 2 shows the final concentrations ct of the parent compounds the kinetic models and kobs min 1 the pseudo first order model fitted most of the pharmaceutical degradation kinetics however some kinetic behaviors were in agreement with chan and chu model 46 as well as with the findings of liu et al 2017 47 for the degradation of chloramphenicol by nano zvi relating the matrix and the kobs values table 2 a considerable decrease in the kinetic of degradation is evident mainly in prg fxt and dzp while pct degradation rate showed less variation in relation with the complexity of matrix the degradations in dw show a higher constant rate due to the greater availability of active sites in zvsi the association of kobs was prg fxt ppn dzp pct in sww a decrease in reaction kinetic was substantial in prg compared to kobs in dw in rhww the presence of ions and organic matter decreases the availability of active sites in zvsi besides the suspended particles could obstruct the passage of uv radiation to the matrix inhibit the formation of ho radicals to promote the oxidation of pharmaceuticals reducing kobs 3 5 reuse experiments the stability of zvsi plays an important role for the treatment processes such behavior was evaluated by a three reuse cycles employing the rhww matrix fig 3 a the zvsi still maintained high degradation capability even after the three reuse cycles as indicated by the xrd acquired after each cycle fig 3b low intensity peaks were observed at 21 23 36 40 60 63 74 and 78 corresponding to the crystalline phase of magnetite no significant alterations of the crystalline phases were observed by xrd indicating the structural stability of the catalyst the degradation rates decreased slowly between the first and the third cycles with reductions of 10 07 pct 1 75 ppn 3 69 flx 6 68 dzp and 6 31 prg the total dissolved iron into the solution decreased with from 9 13 to 6 78 and 6 73 mg l 1 in the first second and third reuse cycles respectively the corresponding consumptions of h2o2 were 30 52 30 12 and 29 38 mg l 1 respectively as the number of reuse cycles increased the adsorption of dip decreased due to loss of the active sites by the formation of hydroxides during washing the results showed removal over 89 93 of pharmaceuticals in three cycles of reuse demonstrating the potential of zvsi reuse for the degradation of pharmaceuticals 3 6 identification of transformation products high resolution mass spectrometry lc qtof ms in positive ionization mode allowed the detection of 23 tps in the aqueous matrixes studied these tps were identified by the m z values associated with low mass errors rdb 5 ppm the lc qtof ms data were based on a purpose built database containing data for 175 tps previously reported in different articles in the current literature the database included the elemental compositions of the tps and their fragments when available table s 6 1 supplementary material during the first 15 min of the process in the dark zvsi related processes include adsorption reduction and oxidation steps which proceeded onto the surface 33 the formations of intermediate radical anions short lived products are predominates in reduction reactions 48 many possible reactions such as the scission of cc and cn bonds can be attributed to this the corrosion of the zvsi by oxygen o2 can produce reactive oxidants capable of oxidize the pharmaceutical compounds these characterized by the hydroxylation reaction of the aromatic ring electron abstraction hydrogen abstraction and double bond addition 42 according to the reactive oxygen species ros involved in the process the superoxide anion is generated by the first reduction of oxygen by 1 electron at low ph it is protonated and called perhydroxyl radical with pka ho2 o2 4 8 49 however the reduction of oxygen by 1 electron is not thermodynamically favored compared to its complete reduction 4 electrons e o2 h2o 0 81 v 50 in contrast the hydroxyl radical ho is the most powerful oxidant among ros with a potential of e ho h2o 2 34 v 51 at low ph values ho is the predominant species pka ho o 11 9 52 therefore the oxidation of pharmaceuticals at ph 3 0 can be explained by the action of ho most of the tps were formed during this stage the dip tps showed an increase in this first part of the process which is related to the rapid reaction of this pharmaceutical with zvsi though the formation of ppn tps occurred in the presence of sunlight and h2o2 addition it is well known that dip is hydrolyzed to 4 maa due to the presence of a water soluble sulfonate group r so3h there are four possible pathways for the cleavage of 4 maa i loss of the methylamine chain partial aromatic ring reduction alkene moiety protonation and subsequent oxidation confirmed by the identification of tp9 dip with and further hydroxylation opening the pyrazolone ring tp2 dip oxidation of secondary alcohol from tp2 dip to ketone forming tp3 dip ii tp7 dip is generated by pyrazolinone ring opening leading to loss of the amino methyl group tp3 dip 53 or formation of tp2 dip tp3 faa a tp from formyl amino antipyrine faa a human metabolite of dip 54 was also observed iii epoxy compound tp2 aaa and n phenylacetamide tp9 aaa originated from acetyl aminoantipyrine aaa another human metabolite of dip 54 tp9 aaa was formed by cleavage of the six membered ring and further nn bond cleavage of the hydrazine group from tp2 aaa an unstable intermediate susceptible to oxidation in an acidic medium 55 the presence of these dip metabolites in rhww was reported by becker et al 2020 10 iv a hydroxylated derivative of 4 maa was formed and oxidized forming a quinone imine intermediate tp17 dip 17 fig 4 a tp1 dzp and tp2 dzp were formed by cleavage of the benzodiazepinic ring from tp6 dzp while tp5 dzp was formed by the loss of ch3 and formation of a five membered ring 56 tp1 dzp and tp5 dzp were detected in drinking water samples 57 evidencing their formation in the environment associated with human metabolism these tps are recalcitrant and were not removed by conventional drinking water treatments tp6 dzp was formed by a hydrolysis reaction of the double bond of dzp during the advanced fenton process fig 4b this tp was previously reported to be a product of a chlorination process 58 ppn contains two types of reactive sites the naphthalene moiety and the lateral chain cleavage and ring opening due to electrophilic hydroxyl radical attack on the naphthalene moiety formed tp7 ppn tp22 ppn tp26 27 ppn and tp45 ppn additionally tp2 ppn and tp3 ppn are side chain derived tps 59 61 the co bond cleavage and subsequent oxidation of the tp7 ppn formed anphthalic acid tp37 ppn 62 fig 4c the degradation of pct follow by two hydroxylation steps on the aromatic ting starts forming tp2 pct and tp 3 pct which can be in the ortho and meta positions tp 3 pct is tri hydroxylated intermediate fig 4d which was previously observed during photo fenton treatment 63 prg undergo h abstraction with the first step of the reaction being electron transfer from oxygen in the enone moiety by zvsi followed by the abstraction of hydrogen by ho generating tp3 prg this tp was identified by shamsipur et al 2017 64 in studies of the electrocatalytic oxidation of prg finally cleavage of the c o bond of flx can produce two types of structures containing and not fluorine atoms it was possible to identify tp16 flx fig 4e evidencing the loss of fluoride and formation of a cyanide group this tp was reported previously by tisler et al 2019 65 concerning the single h2o2 addition out of the 23 tps identified 9 tps were persistent throughout the process in the rhww whereas in the dw and sww matrixes none of the tps identified were detectable at the end of treatment of these 9 persistent tps in the rhww three tps were from dip tp3 dip tp9 aaa and tp3 faa 4 tps from ppn tp2 ppn tp3 ppn tp22 ppn and tp37 ppn and one tp from each dzp and fxt tp2 dzp and tp16 fxt fig s 6 1 supplementary material for the successive h2o2 additions from the 9 tps above tp22 ppn tp3 dip and tp2 dzp were not detectable at the end of process therefore the successive h2o2additions strategy improved the degradation of both the pharmaceuticals and the tps 3 6 1 in silico q sar predictions of toxicological risk and biodegradability of the tps the in silico q sar assessment of toxicity and biodegradability of pharmaceuticals and their tps were carried out by using epi suitetm toxtree and ecosar software table s 6 2 supplementary material shows the ecosar in silico predictions for acute and chronic toxicities towards the aquatic organisms fish daphnid and green algae the lc50 ec50 chv predicted values were evaluated according to the globally harmonized classification and labeling system of chemicals 66 the predictions indicated that the dip tps presented acute toxicity being harmful to fish and daphnid and toxic to green algae dip tps presented high chronic toxicity towards green algae most of the dzp tps presented acute toxicity being harmful to the three organisms tested whereas tp1 dzp tp2 dzp and tp6 dzp presented high chronic toxicity towards fish and daphnid tp16 fxt presented harmful acute and chronic toxicities for the pct tp the predicted lower chronic toxicity values towards all three organisms indicated a threat to the aquatic ecosystem according to the predicted acute and chronic toxicity values for ppn tps most tps could be considered non harmful exception to tp7 ppn and tp22 ppn that showed chronic toxicity towards daphnid finally tp3 prg indicated that the molecule could be considered harmful to the three organisms fig 5 depicts a normalization of the lc50and ec50values for fish daphnid and green algae comparing tps to their parent compounds in order to show their toxicity effects i e lc50tp lc50parent compound a value 1 indicated that the tp toxicity was lower than their parent compounds whereas a value 1 indicated higher toxicity of the tp the lc50 and ec50 ratios showed that the tps from fxt pct ppn and prg exhibited lower toxicity compared to its parent compounds ratios 1 however tp2 dip tp3 dip tp7 dip tp9 dip tp2 aaa tp9 aaa and tp3 faa exhibited higher toxicities compared to dip ratios 1 the same behavior was observed for tp1 dzp and tp6 dzp considering the normalized values fig 5 also shows the t30w where the highest intensity peaks of the most toxic tps occurred as depicted four tps tp7 dip tp9 dip tp1 dzp and tp6 dzp fig 5a and c had a higher intensity during the dark stage with a decrease during the solar process the other tps were formed during the oxidative solar stage with the highest intensities in the first 30 min of the process decreasing after compared to the other structures identified dip and dzp tps were predicted as more toxic pct and prg tps presented toxicity and most ppn tps were predicted as harmful and not harmful fig 5d e and f the cramer rules were in accordance with most of the ecosar estimations for dip dzp and ppn it should be noted that the cramer prediction reports toxic effects in terms of oral toxicity while ecosar reports the results in terms of the acute and chronic toxicity values the in silico q sar predictions for biodegradability provided by biowin 1 7 and start toxtree can be seen in table s 6 3 supplementary material comparing the in silico q sar predictions similar results were pointed out indicating most of the tps as non biodegradable compounds biowin is fragment based while start is based on structural alerts which are molecular functional groups or sub structures linked to environmental persistence or biodegradability information about the smiles ecosar fragment type data and biowin 1 7 predictions can be seen in table s 6 3 supplementary material 4 conclusions considering that iron scrap can be easily acquired from industrial waste the use of zvsi as catalyst can improve the economic viability and can be incorporated in integrated system of reduction oxidation for the degradation of pharmaceuticals in complex matrixes excellent results in terms of elimination of the pharmaceuticals were found for the reuse of zvsi the zvsi provides a continuous release of fe2 into the solutions bulk successive h2o2 additions can be used as a strategy improving the pharmaceutical degradation and mineralization ratios combining reducing and oxidizing stages was useful for the remediation of pharmaceuticals and degraded most of the persistent tps that presented toxic characteristics besides zvsi offers an alternative for the treatment of effluents containing high amounts of salts and organic matter reducing the release of toxic products allowing the reuse of industrial waste for the degradation of micropollutants declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have

activity relationship q sar predictions of toxicity and biodegradability were predicted for each tp by using different freely available models according the characterization zvsi consisted mainly of carbon 48 5 and iron 43 6 with 0 6922 m2 g of surface area hematite and magnetite were the main crystalline phases zvsi doehlert design and desirability profile were used to select the experimental conditions higher degradation rates were achieved at ph 3 0 32 5 mg l 1 h2o2 and 2 g l 1 zvsi under the optimal conditions pharmaceuticals removal was as high as 87 in all matrixes evaluated following a pseudo first order kinetic model behavior three reuse cycles were performed using real hospital wastewater rhww achieving degradation percentages 70 and no substantial variation in the crystalline phases of the zvsi was observed twenty three tps were detected according to in silico q sar predictions the integrated system decreased the toxicity of tps moreover most of tps were predicted as persistent compounds the results indicated that zvsi combined with solar fenton based oxidation is an interesting alternative for the degradation of pharmaceuticals in rhww allowing the reuse of catalyst keywords reduction oxidation process pharmaceuticals degradation transformation products toxicity biodegradability 1 introduction brazil is one of the countries that has substantial iron ore reserves 1 zero valent scrap iron zvsi a waste product from metalworking industries possesses excellent reactivity similar to zero valent iron zvi but is available at a very low price the replacement of zvi by zvsi in processes can decrease the overall costs and also provide a use for scrap iron 2 however few studies have explored the advantages of this material 2 4 zvi has been successfully applied for the treatment of water and wastewater contain pharmaceuticals 5 zvi is a reactive metal with standard redox potential e0 0 44 v therefore it is an effective reducer when it reacts with contaminants containing carbonyl nitro and azo groups such as pharmaceuticals the mechanism of elimination of contaminants by zvi via reduction refers to the directional transfer of electrons from zvi to the contaminants eq 1 6 reduction of carbonyl compounds generates alcohol derivatives whereas nitro and azo reductions lead to amino derivatives sometimes the hydroxyl and amino moieties are much more susceptible to degradation than other functional groups commonly present in some parent compounds 5 meanwhile when the system is in the presence of dissolved oxygen do there can be corrosion of zvi and in situ generation of h2o2 eq 2 5 moreover zvi is oxidized by two electron transfer in the presence of h2o2 under the acidic conditions eq 3 7 the release of fe2 ions in zvi h2o2 systems is known as the fenton reaction which can produce hydroxyl radicals ho that have a strong oxidizing capacity e0 2 8 v 8 towards a variety of organic compounds this oxidation of contaminants can be through i a homogeneous fenton mechanism ii heterogeneous reaction inducedor iii the synergic action of both mechanisms 9 1 fe0 fe2 2e 2 fe0 o2 2h fe2 h2o2 3 fe0 h2o2 2h fe2 2h2o on the other hand most of the studies using zvi for the degradation of pharmaceuticals analyzed the degradation of a single compound in water or simulated effluents 5 however complex matrixes like raw hospital wastewater rhww or wastewater treatment plants wwtp are known to contain a large variety of pharmaceuticals 10 in different concentrations 11 consequently the study of mixtures of pharmaceutical compounds in real matrixes is necessary to have greater precision regarding the effectiveness of the treatment when zvi is used for degradation of pharmaceuticals which are present as complex mixtures in wastewater different degradation pathways are generated leading to the formation of intermediates called transformation products tps whose presence and amounts can vary depending on the matrix and the treatment employed 12 the presence of pharmaceuticals and tps can lead to synergistic and or antagonistic effects 13 it has in turn an environmental outcomes the assessment of environmental fate and effects could to avoid or reduce their environmental and human health impacts combining analytical techniques such as lc qtof ms and in silico quantitative structure activity relationship q sar predictions tools are powerful approaches for a proactive assessment of environmental fate and toxicity this combination can provide a strong indication about the tps that may have adverse effects enabling the proposal of the most appropriate conditions and the types of treatment that could provide total removal of tps 14 15 the goal of this work was to evaluate the degradation of a mixture of pharmaceuticals in real hospital wastewater rhww employing zvsi as a source of the iron species required in a combined reduction oxidation process degradation pathways were proposed for pharmaceutical degradation together with in silico q sar predictions of the toxicities and biodegradabilities of the proposed tps 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and aqueous matrixes standards of paracetamol pct propranolol ppn dipyrone dip fluoxetine fxt diazepam dzp and progesterone prg analytical grade purity 90 were used for the degradation study a mixed stock solution was prepared at a concentration of 14 g l 1of each of target compounds in acetonitrile methanol 2 1 v v dilutions of the stock solution were prepared at the initial concentrations of 500 μg l 1 of each pharmaceutical compounds for the degradation experiments the three aqueous matrixes employed were distilled water dw simulated wastewater sww and raw hospital wastewater rhww the composition of the sww was adapted from the oecd recommendation 16 consisted of peptone 160 mg l 1 beef extract 110 mg l 1 urea 30 mg l 1 mg2so4 7h2o 2 mg l 1 and cacl2 2h2o 4 mg l 1 the characteristics of the rhww can be seen in the table 1 the rhww employed in the degradation studies was used as collected without filtration the pharmaceutical compounds were spiked into the different aqueous matrixes prior to ph adjustment 2 2 characterization of the zvsi granulometric powder x ray diffraction xrd scanning electron microscopy sem eds mapping brunauer emmett teller bet surface area sbet and the point of zero charge were analyzed more information about the characterization can be seen in text s 1 supplementary material 2 3 experimental design of the reduction oxidation process doehlert design was used for optimization of the variables in the reduction oxidation table s 2 1 supplementary material batch experiments were performed using a solar photo reactor 1 l equipped with an aeration system providing agitation the zvsi was added to the photo reactor containing the initial mixture of pharmaceuticals in the dark and was left for 15 min after this time h2o2 39 w v was added to the photo reactor which was then exposed to sunlight the initial ph was adjusted to 3 0 using h2so4 0 5 mol l 1 the experiment was carried out at chemistry institute of universidade federal do rio grande do sul rs brazil latitude 30 4 21 0864 s longitude 51 7 11 838 w using natural sunlight irradiation on a sunny day around noon natural solar uv radiation was measured using a solar energy meter sp 2000 icel which provides data in terms of incident radiation w m 2 to facilitate the comparison with other photocatalytic experiments the normalized illumination time t30w 17 was used instead of exposition time t 2 4 reuse experiments the reuse experiments of zvsi were performed in rhww matrix under the same experimental conditions after the first set of experiments the zvsi was separated by centrifugation washed at least three times with ultrapure water and dried at 60 c for 2 h the washed material was employed in three successive experiments 2 5 analytical determinations the iron speciation and h2o2 residual were determined by 1 10 phenanthroline and hydroquinone 18 and nh4vo3 19 methods using a cary 50 uv vis spectrophotometer mineralization was monitored by measuring the doc of the rhww samples with direct injection of the filtered 0 45 μm pvdf membrane samples into a shimadzu toc l csh analyzer 2 6 lc qtof ms instrumentation the pharmaceuticals and their tps were monitored and quantified using a liquid chromatograph nexera x2 shimadzu connected to a qtof mass spectrometer impact ii bruker daltonics further details are provided in text s 3 supplementary material identification of the tps was carried out by constructing a purpose built database with tps reported in the literature including over 175 compounds this database was updated from previous work 20 each tp was assigned with a number and the acronym of the pharmaceutical from which it originated 2 7 in silico predictions of biodegradability and toxicological risk of the tps predictions of biodegradability and ecotoxicity of pharmaceuticals and their tps were made by in silico q sar tools toxtreev 13 0 21 and epi suite biowin 1 7 software from us epa 22 were used to estimate biodegradability persistence and oral toxicity while acute and chronic toxicities were estimated using ecological structure activity relationships ecosar v 2 0 software from us epa 23 the lc50 ratio mg l 1 was calculated dividing lc50 or ec50 fish 96 h daphnid 48 h and green algae 96 h of each tp for the respective values of its parent compound 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the zvsi fig 1 a shows a histogram of the zvsi particle size distribution 85 in the size range 1 2 0 3 mm and 47 corresponding to tyler mesh size 28 0 6 mm for more information table s 1 1 supplementary material according with bet surface area analysis the zvsi has a 0 6922 m2 g with a micropore volume of 2 39 103 cm3 g and 4 13 nm of micropore width the xrd of the zvsi fig 1b showed peaks at 2θ of 27 45 55 65 and 83 the narrow and intense peaks located at 27 and 45 evidenced the crystalline character of the material the xrd crystallographic library data enabled the identification of two phases according to icsd inorganic crystal structure database card 31829 the peaks at 27 and 55 were of graphitic carbon while based on icsd card 64999 the peaks at 45 65 and 83 corresponded to zvi similar results were obtained by shaibani and ghambari 2011 24 the average crystallite size was calculated using the scherrer equation eq 3 3 d k λ β c o s θ where k is the scherrer constant 0 91 β is the width at half height λ is the wavelength of the radiation 0 15406 nm and θ is the bragg angle values of 56 2 and 25 1 nm were obtained for the graphitic carbon and metallic iron respectively the layered image obtained using sem fig 1c showed a little of surface oxidation onto the material the particles presented irregular edges rough surfaces and were deformed because mechanical machining processes generated them at higher magnification fig 1d small pores could be seen onto surface indicating that the material could act as an adsorbent the energy dispersive spectrometry eds technique showed the presence of the elements fe c o si cr mn and ca fig 1e carbon and iron presented the highest percentages 48 5 and 43 6 respectively the hydrated surface of zvsi in aqueous solution could be ph dependent the effect of ph on the surface charge is characterized by the isoelectric point iep fig s 4 1 supplementary material shows the zeta potential of the zvsi particles as a function of solution ph the iep was found to be near ph 7 0 while increasing the ph the zvsi particles acquired an outer layer of iron oxide at the surface where ligands could be adsorbed the adsorption of anions decreases the iep once more protons are needed to neutralize the negative charges of the adsorbed anionic species 25 at ph 3 0 the zvsi presented a positive surface charge of 16 63 mv which could be explained by transfer of fe2 fe3 to the solution and the formation of dimers of fe2o3 nh2o on the surface as the ph was changed the species formed on the surface of the zvsi also changed as shown by charge variations 3 2 optimization of the experimental conditions using a doehlert design preliminary studies were carried out in the dark using the zvsi with agitation for 60 min using an aeration system fig s 4 2 supplementary material the results revealed greater degradation of the pharmaceuticals in the system when aeration was applied zvi air zvi air promotes the coexistence of reduction adsorption and oxidation reactions due to h2o2 formation in an acidic medium by the reaction of zvi with o2 26 this result is in accordance with xiong et al 2015 27 who indicated the degradation capacity of zvi could be improved by air aeration according to the core shell model 28 the shell consists of iron oxides hydroxides formed by the oxidation of zvsi and the oxide film provides sites for chemical reactions zvsi can serve as an electron donor eq 1 and pharmaceuticals accept the electrons and undergo reducing reaction first the pharmaceutical according to its charge is easily adsorbed in zvsi to a favorable reaction site and then the electrons are then transferred from the zvsi to the molecule of pharmaceutical although the reduction of pharmaceuticals occurs on the surface of zvsi h2o2 can also be generated in situ from zvsi and initiate oxidative degradation of pharmaceuticals under acidic conditions eq 2 29 while reaction presented in eq 1 is dominant in fe2 generation the reaction presented in eq 2 controls the generation of fe2 ions in the presence of dissolved oxygen do 30 and promotes the fenton reaction in the zvsi air water matrix in the darkness yuan et al 2016 31 proved that zvi could intensify fenton process the highest primary elimination of pharmaceuticals occurred in the first 15 min so this time was established as the contact time of zvsi with the pharmaceuticals solution in the dark after which the solar photo fenton process was immediately started with addition of h2o2 doehlert design quadratic model was applied to optimize the experimental conditions of zvsi g l 1 and h2o2 mg l 1 at ph 3 0 in a dw matrix nine experiments were performed and the analytical response was reported as the percentage decrease of the summed peak areas of the pharmaceuticals 1 σ at a0 100 after t30w 25 2 min table s 2 1 the highest degradations rates were found in the experiments 5 98 36 and 6 99 06 analysis of variance anova table s 2 2 supplementary material and the f test provided the statistical significance within a 95 confidence interval confirming that the quadratic model could explain 97 57 of the variance the pareto chart of the effects fig s 2 2 shows that the variables zvsi and h2o2 and the square of the zvsi are considered statistically important for treatment furthermore the pareto chart of effects shows that although zvsi and h2o2 have a positive effect on treatment the quadratic interaction term has an antagonist effect confirming the results shown in the desirability profile fig s 2 1 supplementary material the desirability profile from 0 0 undesirable to 1 0 very desirable provided indication of the optimum experimental conditions the h2o2concentration showed desirability value of 1 0 in the range from 32 5 to 64 mg l 1 intermediate concentration level whereas for zvsi was 2 g maximum amount evaluated accordingly ph 3 0 32 5 mg l 1of h2o2 and 2 g zvsi were selected for the subsequent experiments in order to confirm the effectiveness of these conditions experiments 5 and 6 were performed in sww matrix a matrix containing high organic matter content similar to the rhww matrix and more complex than dw higher degradation rates were achieved in experiment 6 compared to experiment 5 with values of 94 59 and 87 48 respectively confirming the correct selection of the experimental conditions 3 3 degradation of pharmaceutical compounds in different aqueous matrixes the solar driven zvsi oxidation process was carried out for t30w 53 9 min using the dw sww andrhww matrixes under the optimized conditions described above the results showed that dip presented the highest degradation rates in the three matrixes in the darkness step furthermore fxt dzp and prg were more persistent throughout the process in dw fig 2 a however it can be mentioned that acidic conditions mainly remove most pharmaceuticals through an oxidation reaction to analyze the interaction of the pharmaceuticals with the zvsi the distribution of each pharmaceutical microspecies in function of ph was calculated using chemicalize org by chemaxon 32 fig s 5 1 supplementary material the pharmaceuticals studied were calculated neutrally charged at ph 3 0 with the exception of dip negatively charged influencing the adsorption onto zvsi compared to other pharmaceuticals adsorption favors the transfer of electrons from the zvsi to the dip therefore producing reduction reactions 30 the alkene moiety present in the pyrazolone ring and the substituents from dip is more susceptible to protonation the structure of the products is determined by the site of protonation of the radical anion intermediate formed after the first electron transfer step 34 subsequently the generated ho iron corrosion products represent the oxidation and adsorption ability which is influenced by solution ph 35 in oxidation process the molecules can undergo aromatic ring openings and hydroxylation for more information see section 3 6 preliminary studies were performed considering desorption of dip in acidic and basic solutions as well as in organic solvents such as methanol and ethanol however due to the strong adsorption of dip and its possible reduction onto zvsi it was not possible to calculate the amount of dip adsorbed on the other hand pct fxt dzp and prg were identified at the end of the treatment in both sww and rhww matrixes fig 2c and e table 1 shows the final concentrations of the pharmaceuticals in the different matrixes studied the results showed that the complexity of the matrix decreased the efficiency of the solar process the zvsi capacity for adsorption of dip and degradation of pharmaceuticals decreased in sww and rhww matrixes which could be explained by the ionic effects caused by the phosphate chloride and sulfate ions occupy active sites and form strong complexes onto zvi surface 36 this behavior was also observed by springer et al 2016 37 where lower dip adsorption was associated with increases in the concentrations of ligands such as phosphate or sulfate suggesting that the dip adsorption mechanism was influenced by the formation of complexes between the internal sphere and metal ions on the particle surface lai et al 38 confirmed the formation of a passive film on the surface of zvi granular activated carbon consisting of inorganic ions i e feso4 fepo4and fe3 po4 2 in the wastewater treatment which decreased the degradation efficiency on the other hand organic matter adsorbs on the catalyst surfaces providing strong steric repulsive forces that oppose the attractive zvsi magnetic interactions 39 natural organic matter is a common scavenger of reactive radicals and humic acids can significantly restrict the elimination of pharmaceuticals in the zvsi system 40 the initial ph 3 0 accelerated corrosion of the zvsi releasing more fe2 into the solutions bulk final concentrations of fe2 9 30 mg l 1 in dw 10 24 mg l 1 in sww 9 75 mg l 1 in rhww compared to fe3 final concentrations of fe3 0 78 mg l 1 in dw 0 34 mg l 1 in sww 0 52 mg l 1 in rhww fig 2b d and f the zvsi acted as a continuous source of dissolved iron into the solution with a predominance of fe2 which in turn contributed to the homogeneous fenton reaction after the treatment the ph increased to final values of 4 0 3 8 and 3 6 in the dw sww and rhww respectively the increase in ph could reflect the contribution of fe2 in a fenton reaction forming ho and ho such behavior was reported by segura et al 2013 41 who evaluated the capacity of the zvi h2o2 system for the wastewaters treatment with different organic amounts in the present work h2o2 consumption was 25 8 mg l 1in dw while in sww and rhww h2o2 was complete consumed successive h2o2 additions were employed to improve the degradation efficiency for this purpose h2o2 was added for four times t30w 0 4 5 9 2 and 13 9 min at a concentration of 8 13 mg l 1 the results obtained fig 2g and 2 h showed that there maining concentration of the parent compounds were lower than single addition table 2 h2o2 was completely consumed and 12 16 mg l 1 of total dissolved iron released into the solutions these results were in agreement with the work of hinojosa guerra et al 2019 42 who used successive additions of h2o2 in a solar photo fenton process for the degradation of pct and amoxicillin in synthetic wastewater and real effluent from a treatment plant achieving degradation rates of 90 and 80 respectively high mineralization rates were obtained using successive h2o2 additions 29 60 compared to a single addition 19 90 these results indicate that successive additions of h2o2 minimized the effect of hydroxyl radical scavengers and preserved the catalytic activity of zvsi decreasing the formation of hydroxides that could inhibit electron transport 3 4 degradation kinetics usually photo fenton process follows a pseudo first order kinetic 43 44 most of the experiments were fitted by the linear behavior of ln c c0 vs t30w r2 0 99 due to competitive matrix effects tps formed and changes in ph 45 other kinetic models were used the model proposed by chan and chu 2003 46 considered two stages of degradation i rapid and indicative of high reactivity and ii slow kinetic characterized by a smaller slope table 2 shows the final concentrations ct of the parent compounds the kinetic models and kobs min 1 the pseudo first order model fitted most of the pharmaceutical degradation kinetics however some kinetic behaviors were in agreement with chan and chu model 46 as well as with the findings of liu et al 2017 47 for the degradation of chloramphenicol by nano zvi relating the matrix and the kobs values table 2 a considerable decrease in the kinetic of degradation is evident mainly in prg fxt and dzp while pct degradation rate showed less variation in relation with the complexity of matrix the degradations in dw show a higher constant rate due to the greater availability of active sites in zvsi the association of kobs was prg fxt ppn dzp pct in sww a decrease in reaction kinetic was substantial in prg compared to kobs in dw in rhww the presence of ions and organic matter decreases the availability of active sites in zvsi besides the suspended particles could obstruct the passage of uv radiation to the matrix inhibit the formation of ho radicals to promote the oxidation of pharmaceuticals reducing kobs 3 5 reuse experiments the stability of zvsi plays an important role for the treatment processes such behavior was evaluated by a three reuse cycles employing the rhww matrix fig 3 a the zvsi still maintained high degradation capability even after the three reuse cycles as indicated by the xrd acquired after each cycle fig 3b low intensity peaks were observed at 21 23 36 40 60 63 74 and 78 corresponding to the crystalline phase of magnetite no significant alterations of the crystalline phases were observed by xrd indicating the structural stability of the catalyst the degradation rates decreased slowly between the first and the third cycles with reductions of 10 07 pct 1 75 ppn 3 69 flx 6 68 dzp and 6 31 prg the total dissolved iron into the solution decreased with from 9 13 to 6 78 and 6 73 mg l 1 in the first second and third reuse cycles respectively the corresponding consumptions of h2o2 were 30 52 30 12 and 29 38 mg l 1 respectively as the number of reuse cycles increased the adsorption of dip decreased due to loss of the active sites by the formation of hydroxides during washing the results showed removal over 89 93 of pharmaceuticals in three cycles of reuse demonstrating the potential of zvsi reuse for the degradation of pharmaceuticals 3 6 identification of transformation products high resolution mass spectrometry lc qtof ms in positive ionization mode allowed the detection of 23 tps in the aqueous matrixes studied these tps were identified by the m z values associated with low mass errors rdb 5 ppm the lc qtof ms data were based on a purpose built database containing data for 175 tps previously reported in different articles in the current literature the database included the elemental compositions of the tps and their fragments when available table s 6 1 supplementary material during the first 15 min of the process in the dark zvsi related processes include adsorption reduction and oxidation steps which proceeded onto the surface 33 the formations of intermediate radical anions short lived products are predominates in reduction reactions 48 many possible reactions such as the scission of cc and cn bonds can be attributed to this the corrosion of the zvsi by oxygen o2 can produce reactive oxidants capable of oxidize the pharmaceutical compounds these characterized by the hydroxylation reaction of the aromatic ring electron abstraction hydrogen abstraction and double bond addition 42 according to the reactive oxygen species ros involved in the process the superoxide anion is generated by the first reduction of oxygen by 1 electron at low ph it is protonated and called perhydroxyl radical with pka ho2 o2 4 8 49 however the reduction of oxygen by 1 electron is not thermodynamically favored compared to its complete reduction 4 electrons e o2 h2o 0 81 v 50 in contrast the hydroxyl radical ho is the most powerful oxidant among ros with a potential of e ho h2o 2 34 v 51 at low ph values ho is the predominant species pka ho o 11 9 52 therefore the oxidation of pharmaceuticals at ph 3 0 can be explained by the action of ho most of the tps were formed during this stage the dip tps showed an increase in this first part of the process which is related to the rapid reaction of this pharmaceutical with zvsi though the formation of ppn tps occurred in the presence of sunlight and h2o2 addition it is well known that dip is hydrolyzed to 4 maa due to the presence of a water soluble sulfonate group r so3h there are four possible pathways for the cleavage of 4 maa i loss of the methylamine chain partial aromatic ring reduction alkene moiety protonation and subsequent oxidation confirmed by the identification of tp9 dip with and further hydroxylation opening the pyrazolone ring tp2 dip oxidation of secondary alcohol from tp2 dip to ketone forming tp3 dip ii tp7 dip is generated by pyrazolinone ring opening leading to loss of the amino methyl group tp3 dip 53 or formation of tp2 dip tp3 faa a tp from formyl amino antipyrine faa a human metabolite of dip 54 was also observed iii epoxy compound tp2 aaa and n phenylacetamide tp9 aaa originated from acetyl aminoantipyrine aaa another human metabolite of dip 54 tp9 aaa was formed by cleavage of the six membered ring and further nn bond cleavage of the hydrazine group from tp2 aaa an unstable intermediate susceptible to oxidation in an acidic medium 55 the presence of these dip metabolites in rhww was reported by becker et al 2020 10 iv a hydroxylated derivative of 4 maa was formed and oxidized forming a quinone imine intermediate tp17 dip 17 fig 4 a tp1 dzp and tp2 dzp were formed by cleavage of the benzodiazepinic ring from tp6 dzp while tp5 dzp was formed by the loss of ch3 and formation of a five membered ring 56 tp1 dzp and tp5 dzp were detected in drinking water samples 57 evidencing their formation in the environment associated with human metabolism these tps are recalcitrant and were not removed by conventional drinking water treatments tp6 dzp was formed by a hydrolysis reaction of the double bond of dzp during the advanced fenton process fig 4b this tp was previously reported to be a product of a chlorination process 58 ppn contains two types of reactive sites the naphthalene moiety and the lateral chain cleavage and ring opening due to electrophilic hydroxyl radical attack on the naphthalene moiety formed tp7 ppn tp22 ppn tp26 27 ppn and tp45 ppn additionally tp2 ppn and tp3 ppn are side chain derived tps 59 61 the co bond cleavage and subsequent oxidation of the tp7 ppn formed anphthalic acid tp37 ppn 62 fig 4c the degradation of pct follow by two hydroxylation steps on the aromatic ting starts forming tp2 pct and tp 3 pct which can be in the ortho and meta positions tp 3 pct is tri hydroxylated intermediate fig 4d which was previously observed during photo fenton treatment 63 prg undergo h abstraction with the first step of the reaction being electron transfer from oxygen in the enone moiety by zvsi followed by the abstraction of hydrogen by ho generating tp3 prg this tp was identified by shamsipur et al 2017 64 in studies of the electrocatalytic oxidation of prg finally cleavage of the c o bond of flx can produce two types of structures containing and not fluorine atoms it was possible to identify tp16 flx fig 4e evidencing the loss of fluoride and formation of a cyanide group this tp was reported previously by tisler et al 2019 65 concerning the single h2o2 addition out of the 23 tps identified 9 tps were persistent throughout the process in the rhww whereas in the dw and sww matrixes none of the tps identified were detectable at the end of treatment of these 9 persistent tps in the rhww three tps were from dip tp3 dip tp9 aaa and tp3 faa 4 tps from ppn tp2 ppn tp3 ppn tp22 ppn and tp37 ppn and one tp from each dzp and fxt tp2 dzp and tp16 fxt fig s 6 1 supplementary material for the successive h2o2 additions from the 9 tps above tp22 ppn tp3 dip and tp2 dzp were not detectable at the end of process therefore the successive h2o2additions strategy improved the degradation of both the pharmaceuticals and the tps 3 6 1 in silico q sar predictions of toxicological risk and biodegradability of the tps the in silico q sar assessment of toxicity and biodegradability of pharmaceuticals and their tps were carried out by using epi suitetm toxtree and ecosar software table s 6 2 supplementary material shows the ecosar in silico predictions for acute and chronic toxicities towards the aquatic organisms fish daphnid and green algae the lc50 ec50 chv predicted values were evaluated according to the globally harmonized classification and labeling system of chemicals 66 the predictions indicated that the dip tps presented acute toxicity being harmful to fish and daphnid and toxic to green algae dip tps presented high chronic toxicity towards green algae most of the dzp tps presented acute toxicity being harmful to the three organisms tested whereas tp1 dzp tp2 dzp and tp6 dzp presented high chronic toxicity towards fish and daphnid tp16 fxt presented harmful acute and chronic toxicities for the pct tp the predicted lower chronic toxicity values towards all three organisms indicated a threat to the aquatic ecosystem according to the predicted acute and chronic toxicity values for ppn tps most tps could be considered non harmful exception to tp7 ppn and tp22 ppn that showed chronic toxicity towards daphnid finally tp3 prg indicated that the molecule could be considered harmful to the three organisms fig 5 depicts a normalization of the lc50and ec50values for fish daphnid and green algae comparing tps to their parent compounds in order to show their toxicity effects i e lc50tp lc50parent compound a value 1 indicated that the tp toxicity was lower than their parent compounds whereas a value 1 indicated higher toxicity of the tp the lc50 and ec50 ratios showed that the tps from fxt pct ppn and prg exhibited lower toxicity compared to its parent compounds ratios 1 however tp2 dip tp3 dip tp7 dip tp9 dip tp2 aaa tp9 aaa and tp3 faa exhibited higher toxicities compared to dip ratios 1 the same behavior was observed for tp1 dzp and tp6 dzp considering the normalized values fig 5 also shows the t30w where the highest intensity peaks of the most toxic tps occurred as depicted four tps tp7 dip tp9 dip tp1 dzp and tp6 dzp fig 5a and c had a higher intensity during the dark stage with a decrease during the solar process the other tps were formed during the oxidative solar stage with the highest intensities in the first 30 min of the process decreasing after compared to the other structures identified dip and dzp tps were predicted as more toxic pct and prg tps presented toxicity and most ppn tps were predicted as harmful and not harmful fig 5d e and f the cramer rules were in accordance with most of the ecosar estimations for dip dzp and ppn it should be noted that the cramer prediction reports toxic effects in terms of oral toxicity while ecosar reports the results in terms of the acute and chronic toxicity values the in silico q sar predictions for biodegradability provided by biowin 1 7 and start toxtree can be seen in table s 6 3 supplementary material comparing the in silico q sar predictions similar results were pointed out indicating most of the tps as non biodegradable compounds biowin is fragment based while start is based on structural alerts which are molecular functional groups or sub structures linked to environmental persistence or biodegradability information about the smiles ecosar fragment type data and biowin 1 7 predictions can be seen in table s 6 3 supplementary material 4 conclusions considering that iron scrap can be easily acquired from industrial waste the use of zvsi as catalyst can improve the economic viability and can be incorporated in integrated system of reduction oxidation for the degradation of pharmaceuticals in complex matrixes excellent results in terms of elimination of the pharmaceuticals were found for the reuse of zvsi the zvsi provides a continuous release of fe2 into the solutions bulk successive h2o2 additions can be used as a strategy improving the pharmaceutical degradation and mineralization ratios combining reducing and oxidizing stages was useful for the remediation of pharmaceuticals and degraded most of the persistent tps that presented toxic characteristics besides zvsi offers an alternative for the treatment of effluents containing high amounts of salts and organic matter reducing the release of toxic products allowing the reuse of industrial waste for the degradation of micropollutants declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have

and horizontal args transfer during the treatment of antibiotics in bes promisingly arb and args could be inhibited by a higher electric current this study raises questions regarding the potential

electrolysis cells constructed wetland 1 introduction antibiotics are widely used in human medicine animal husbandry agriculture and aquaculture 1 2 large amounts of antibiotics are released into municipal wastewater due to their excessive consumption and incomplete metabolism in human and animal gut 3 4 these drugs can then enter various water bodies through diverse pathways including through the effluent from wastewater treatment plants wwtps animal feeding operations fish hatcheries or surface runoff 4 5 even at low concentrations the presence of antibiotics and their byproducts in engineered or natural ecosystems possess significant risks to human and environmental health 2 6 the additional health concern is the acquisition of antibiotic resistance genes args by microorganisms which can also be driven by antibiotic 5 7 8 recently the world health organization considers the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistant bacteria arb as one of the three most significant threats

among microorganisms in activated sludge 12 moreover antibiotics are generally resistant to biodegradation due to their lethality to microbial communities 13 14 bioelectrochemical systems bes such as microbial fuel cells mfcs and microbial electrolysis cells mecs are novel anaerobic biotechnologies that can accelerate the removal of the pollutant 15 17 mfcs utilize microorganisms that biologically redox organic matter and transfer electrons to the anode 18 similar to mfcs mecs are consisted with an electric driven hydrogen evolution process can result in a high yield of hydrogen during wastewater removal 19 in recent years some traditional wastewater treatment technologies such as constructed wetland cw and membrane bioreactor mbr have been combined with mfc to obtain the individual advantages of each component the microbial fuel cell coupled with a constructed wetland cw mfc system is a new technology that embeds an mfc into a cw to treat wastewater and produce energy 20 mbr technology has been adopted as an efficient wastewater treatment technology due to its simultaneous filtration and biological function effects 21 the coupling of mfc and mbr systems offers many advantages such as high effluent quality effective fouling reduction and considerable energy savings 21 22 researchers have determined that bes can enhance the removal rate of antibiotics via oxidation and reduction reactions as shown in fig 1 6 23 ceftriaxone sodium can be biodegraded while electricity is simultaneously produced in an mfc 24 zhang et al 25 observed that 90 of 200 μg l 1 sulfamethoxazole smx could be degraded by using a three dimensional biofilm electrode reactor 26 in addition to antibiotics themselves some antibiotic degradation products may be toxic exploration of the degradation pathways and metabolites of antibiotics would greatly benefit the evaluation of their environmental risks 6 in particular electrical stimulation affects the physical properties of bacteria 27 such as transmembrane permeability and membrane potential 28 29 resulting in the variation of args and arb present in bes 30 hence the investigation of the fate of arb and args in bess is essential this paper intending to summarize the antibiotic removal efficacy by the bes technologies and the associating fate of arb and args through reviewing the limited literature on bes fig 2 this review addresses the question of whether bes can benefit the removal of antibiotics and while inhibiting arb and args 2 performance of mfcs 2 1 mfcs for antibiotic removal 2 1 1 performance of antibiotic removal the performance of mfcs in treating antibiotics is summarized in table 1 two chambered mfcs and single chambered mfcs are frequently used in antibiotic removal processes mfcs have been reported to achieve high antibiotic removal efficiencies ranging from 98 removal efficiency for β lactam antibiotics by single chambered type to 85 removal for nitroimidazoles 90 for sulfonamides 84 for chloramphenicol 99 for quinolones and 80 for tetracyclines by two chambered type 25 31 35 table 1 since the adsorption behavior is not likely to dramatically affect the concentration of sulfonamide antibiotic after months of operation the removal of the antibiotic in mfcs can be attributed mainly to the microbial activity 6 2 1 2 roles of anode for antibiotic removal in traditional mfcs antibiotics can be oxidized by the anode chamber while the air cathode chamber is difficult to degrade antibiotics hence the improved degradation of antibiotics at the anodes of mfcs might be attributed to the current generated which is absent in traditional anaerobic treatments 24 zhang et al indicated that electrically assisted microbial degradation of cefazolin sodium cfzs played a crucial role in effective cfzs removal 39 continuous electron transfer makes the anode a sufficient anaerobic terminal electron acceptor which might promote the metabolic activity of functional anaerobic microbes 31 generally the atp level of microbes in mfc was higher than that in an open circuit reactor indicating that microorganisms were more active in mfcs than in control systems 6 possibly through the rapid degradation of antibiotics in mfcs 2 1 3 antibiotic concentration and organic matter in addition the removal efficiency of antibiotics is affected by the concentrations of antibiotics in the influent of the concentrations in mfcs for example metronidazole removal ability was strongly inhibited at the high initial concentration of 50 mg l 1 with 44 removal efficiency after 24 h 32 wang et al also noted that the half life of smx increased from 1 day to 3 days when the concentration of smx was increased from 20 mg l 1 to 200 mg l 1 in the mfcs 36 these results indicate that high initial antibiotic concentrations reduce removal capacity possibly due to the inhibition of microbial activity by antibiotics 6 32 carbon sources such as glucose and acetic acid are easily metabolized by microorganism indicating that they can be used more quickly and produce electricity better for mfc however antibiotics are not a necessary carbon source for microbes and even inhibit or kill bacteria 35 an extra carbon source is often used in mfcs for balancing the between commensalism and competition of the microbial community previous studies mainly focus on the removal performance of antibiotics with organic matter or without additional organic matter for instance 91 of ceftriaxone sodium was removed in an mfc compared with 51 in an anaerobic reactor containing 50 mg l 1 ceftriaxone sodium and 1000 mg l 1 glucose 24 miran et al explored that the removal efficiency of smx was above 90 with a concentration of 0 08 mm sodium lactate cod 500 mg l 1 present in an mfc additionally a significantly improved cap removal rate was obtained with acetate as the electron donor in an mfc system 25 these results indicate that accelerated removal of antibiotics is due mainly to faster oxidation in co metabolic degradation based on biocatalysis 38 on the other hand an mfc with no extra carbon source exhibited extremely poor performance in the removal of the nitroaromatic antibiotic chloramphenicol 31 after 10 months running approximately 85 of 20 mg l 1 smx was mineralized within 12 h which utilized smx as the sole organic matter 6 this indicates that biocatalysis based anaerobic degradation of antibiotics is probably due to direct oxidation by the anode in which the antibiotic is served as a sole electron donor 6 31 38 2 2 effect of antibiotics on electricity production the effect of antibiotic degradation on electricity generation in mfc was reviewed a maximum power density of 113 w m 3 was obtained at a current density of 13 a m 2 using a mixture of 50 mg l 1 ceftriaxone sodium and 1000 mg l 1 glucose which is 6 fold higher than that with only1000 mg l 1 glucose in the mfc system 24 in addition when penicillin increased from 0 to 50 mg l 1 which resulted in higher maximum power density in an mfc fed glucose 34 antibiotics such as penicillin roxithromycin sulfadimidine and norfloxacin as co substrates might be metabolized by microorganism and consequently maintaining the mfc performance 34 35 in addition degradation product of antibiotic might be further consumed in mfc when the product was the nitrogen and carbon source 6 these results indicate that power production depends on the type of antibiotic and concentration as well as the co substrate penicillin might enhance the electron permeability of cell membranes and increase the release and activity of enzymes 40 giving rise to an increased direct electron transfer to outer cell membranes and consequently improving the mfc performance 34 however in another study zhang et al 39 demonstrated that an increased cfzs concentration to 100 mg l 1 caused a decrease of electricity production to 0 1 v in comparison the rise of cfzs concentration to 300 mg l 1 did not reduce the electricity production after long term operation of mfcs with 100 mg l 1 cfzs 39 as discussed in section 2 1 antibiotic acclimatization probably led to the generation of more antibiotic resistant microbial species and subsequently increased the antibiotic tolerance of mfcs in mfc process antibiotics could be served as electron mediators for enhancing electron transfer from exoelectrogens to the anode 41 in addition antibiotics could stimulate bioelectrocatalytic activity of anodic biofilm as well 42 nevertheless the maximum voltage was 157 mv after running for 40 h in the presence of 50 mg l 1 tc indicating that tc can be used as the sole substrate for electricity generation in mfcs 33 3 mecs for antibiotic removal 3 1 performance of antibiotic removal the performance of mecs in removing antibiotics has gained widespread attention in recent years table 2 since harnisch et al 43 utilized this technology to treat sulfonamides studies using mecs for the removal of cap 92 5 99 sulfonamide antibiotics 69 88 and tc 72 have been intensified table 2 mecs with different operational procedures and electrode configurations including the graphite fiber brush active carbon fiber and metal foam electrode have been illustrated in many studies table 2 the removal efficiency of cap is affected by the operating temperature of mecs cap degradation decreased notably upon switching from 25 c to 10 c 44 possibly due to a decrease in the cathode current generation due to the reduced operating temperature glucose metabolism by cathodophilic microbes in addition to the degradation of cap by extracellular electrons from the electrode was inhibited at low temperatures 44 3 2 potential for antibiotic removal the applied voltage was one of the most important factors in determining the degradation efficiency of antibiotics in mecs sulfadiazine sdz removal efficiency increased when the voltage was enhanced from 0 to 0 9 v in mecs 51 this result might be attributed to the stimulated bacterial activity and accelerated biofilm formation by the electric voltage 52 the cap removal efficiency tended to increase when a negative cathode potential of 1 25 v was applied thus a negative cathode potential can provide sufficient electrons to alter the microbial community 27 3 3 roles of biocathode for antibiotic removal biocathode plays an important factor in determining the removal of antibiotics for instance the removal efficiency of cap over 24 h was higher with a biocathode than with an abiotic cathode in mecs 46 in addition the cap removal efficiency dropped to 62 0 when the biocathode was disconnected 45 the initial current of the biocathode was 3 2 times higher than that of the abiotic cathode despite the similar cathode potentials of the two cathodes 45 the biocathode exhibited a high cap reduction rate likely because biocathode microorganisms could obtain electrons directly from the cathode and were involved in cap degradation 45 a biofilm on the cathode appears to facilitate mass transfer between the electrode and electrolyte 46 metal foams offer larger specific surface areas and have porous walls when compared with typical metal electrodes 53 the unique characteristics of metal foams can be used in electrodes to degrade antibiotics through electrochemical deposition wu et al investigated the degradation ability by using carbon rod removal efficiency 100 nickel foam removal efficiency 94 9 and copper foam removal efficiency 100 as cathodes to removal cap in mecs and found out copper foam exhibited desirable performance of complete degradation for cap 49 indicating that metal foams are a promising cathode material for antibiotic removal in mec 4 coupled system for antibiotic removal 4 1 summary of coupled system for antibiotic removal in terms of restoring the deteriorating environment traditional wastewater treatment technologies such as cw and mbr systems operating as standalone technologies which are insufficient 54 in recent years many coupled bes systems have been developed for antibiotic removal 55 these systems include an mfc sorption system coupled photo electrochemical catalysis in an mfc mfc pec or ec mbr mfc cw mfc and cw mfc mec table 3 yang et al developed a novel continuous flow mfc sorption system for tc removal and found out that high tc concentration high electrolyte concentration and low ph value could increase the tc adsorption capacity 56 this work also indicates that the increased numbers of mfcs connected in series could accelerate the removal efficiency of tc due to the higher current 56 however tc was adsorbed rather than degraded and further treatment requirements should be investigated in another study an mfc pec and mfc ec were constructed to degrade tc in the cathode chamber 57 bioelectricity assists with oxygen reduction compared with feo tio2 which forms reactive oxygen species ros to efficiently facilitate tc degradation and electricity generation 57 furthermore a new coupled mbr mfc system with filled granular activated carbon by doped feooh tio2 feooh tio2 gac was found to mitigate membrane fouling to achieve more than 90 tc hydrochloride removal this removal was due to oxygen reduction reactions proceeding along the 2e pathway and the formation of hydrogen peroxide 21 4 2 cw mfcs for antibiotic removal cw mfc as an emerging technology has recently attracted attention for antibiotic removal in a more recent study tc and smx were removed efficiently with tc exhibiting greater removal efficiency compared with smx in cw mfcs 58 60 additionally the sdz concentration was lower in a closed circuit mode cw mfc than in an open mode 61 this reduction was consistent with a series of biological and physicochemical processes such as substrate absorption electrode absorption microbial degradation desirable dehydrogenase activity plant uptake and hydrolysis which may be involved in antibiotic removal in cw mfcs 62 58 63 although antibiotics could be removed effectively by a single cw mfc and mec the risk of arg release when using this technology has received little attention in a cw mfc mec system the degradation of antibiotics was achieved by using bioelectricity generated from cw mfc without using external power 59 64 the mec has been used effectively as a pretreatment for antibiotics and the effluent can be used as the influent to a cw mfc for further degradation the coupled system has been shown to degrade high concentrations of smx 65 this result is unsurprising because a relatively stable electricity supply provided by the stacked cw mfcs could support the mecs for effective smx pretreatment 85 73 followed by further smx degradation by the cw mfcs 65 these coupled systems are efficient and energy saving for the removal of antibiotics without an external power supply 5 microbial community and activity in bes 5 1 predominant bacteria the predominant microbes including bacteria and methanogen may be directly related to the biodegradation of antibiotics and the abundance of args 8 the microbial community composition in the bes at the phylum level is summarized in fig 3 after incubation in the presence of antibiotics the six dominant phyla proteobacteria bacteroidetes clostridia actinobacteria firmicutes and chloroflexi in the bes were differing markedly compared with those in the open circuit and activated sludge groups fig 3 the proteobacteria was the most abundant phylum and included geobacter acinetobacter stenotrophomonas azoarcus aeromonas pseudomonas achromobacter alcaligenes and enterobacter in the bes 33 36 39 42 geobacter pseudomonas and alcaligenes are electrochemically active bacteria that responsible for electron transfer via cathode and anode 27 33 39 66 wang et al suggested that the enterobacter was most likely responsible for the biodegradation of tc in their mfc 33 in addition achromobacter pseudomonas and thauera have demonstrated the capability for smx degradation 36 38 cap degrading bacteria such as azoarcus pseudomonas comamonas rhodococcus chryseobacterium and nitrososphaera were also found in the bes 25 27 in conclusion the microbes of the mfc anode biofilm can be functionally categorized into two groups antibiotic degrading bacteria and exoelectrogens 25 complex interactions among these functional bacteria are crucial for antibiotic degradation and electricity generation in mfcs first the substrate was metabolized by exoelectrogens which were responsible for the current generation the electrons produced then accelerated the metabolic reactions of anaerobic bacteria 67 next bacteria with strong catabolic versatility may be developed to improve antibiotic removal 25 5 2 methanogenic communities methanogenic communities were analyzed to gain insight into the inhibitory effects of antibiotics on the performance of anaerobic reactors 26 27 the abundance of methylobacillus was altered in samples collected under different operating conditions of mecs 27 the relative abundances of vadinca11 and methanosarcina increased with increased voltage whereas methanosaeta and methanomassiliicoccus exhibited the opposite trend in the bes 26 a previous study revealed that homoacetogenesis coupled with hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis promoted anaerobic smx degradation in anaerobic reactors 1 in addition methylobacillus is capable of utilizing methanol and methylamine madhaiyan et al 2012 which may facilitate biodegradation of contaminants in mecs these findings suggest that functional methanogenic communities are important for antibiotic degradation but depend on the electrons in the system 26 27 5 3 roles of current for microbial communities previous results have indicated that the homeostasis of microbial communities could be affected by antibiotics and electrical stimulation 27 48 the main difference observed with differing initial cap concentrations was the distribution of the phyla proteobacteria bacteroidetes and firmicutes suggesting that the homeostasis of microbial community was affected by cap concentrations 27 in addition the abundance of proteobacteria gradually decreased as the cathode potential became less negative indicating that some specific species were enriched by electrical stimulation 27 this result is unsurprising because stimulation with the appropriate current resulted in increased dehydrogenase activity and cell proliferation 48 5 4 roles of organic matter and smx for microbial communities according to the results of principal coordinates analysis pcoa wang et al noted that biological samples tended to cluster together when mfcs were fed the same substrate acetate or smx 36 furthermore when the substrate was changed the diversity of the bacterial community decreased sharply 36 38 these results suggest that certain species are favored for the consumption of different substrates sodium acetate or smx and hence that the substrate affected the bacterial community structure in addition different operating modes mfc and abiotic control of mfcs could also strongly influence the diversity of the microbial community 36 6 fate of arb and args in bes anaerobic bess produce less sludge than wwtps which limits the proliferation of args in the process of sludge disposal 27 68 although antibiotics could be significantly removed in bes the risks of arb and args release using this technology have received little attention therefore the fate of arb and args in the bes is of significant significance fig 4 operating parameters such as cathodic potentials anode electrode antibiotics and their concentrations and dissolved oxygen have the potential to influence the occurrence and abundance of args and arb 27 48 69 70 yuan et al indicated that the average removal rate of tc and sulfonamide resistant e coli increased significantly when the bes was switched from high current to open circuit mode 70 in addition the bacterial density with 10 v direct voltage was 1 48 times higher than that of the control 0 v at 48 h in a bes 69 furthermore the abundances of chloramphenicol resistant bacteria crb at 1 25 v were more than 6 and 18 times higher than those at 1 v indicating that the abundances of crb increased with a more negative cathode potential 27 this is because the args persist with their host bacteria after surviving anode electrode and the electron shuttles excreted by exoelectrogens 70 however an 84 5 death rate of arb was observed in response to the application of 25 ma in a minimal nutrient medium which was caused by the excessive ros production under high electric current in bes 71 these results indicate that arb can be inhibited by using the proper electric current in the bes during the treatment of antibiotic residues 6 1 fate of arb in bes the promotion or elimination of arb may be caused by oxidative stress and adenosine triphosphate atp under electrical stimulation in bes it was seen that with the increased current density ros production in arb increased which suggested that ros were positively associated with the current compared with the open circuit mode lactic dehydrogenase ldh increased with an enhancement of current from 7 to 28 ma suggested that the current enhanced cell membrane permeability 69 antibiotics may enter the cell due to changes in cell membrane property under a strong electric field resulting in the death of bacteria without args thereby selectively increasing the abundance of arb 27 in addition the abundance of arb was enhanced due to the increase in atp concentration that occurred with the increased current 69 hence proper electric stimulation could enhance the levels of ros production membrane permeability and atp of arb however when the current increased by a specific range 28 ma excess ros production resulted in a decrease of arb 69 6 2 fate of args in bes compared with arb the fate of args in bes is quite complicated the expression of chloramphenicol resistance genes crgs decreased with more negative cathode potential in mec 27 in addition the abundance of args decreased by about 90 when the current was raised from 0 to 25 ma in mec 71 thus the application of current in bes treatment of antibiotic contaminated wastewater could be beneficial in contrast previous results indicated that electrical stimulation enhanced the abundance of args 61 the average removal rates of inti1 suli and tet e were enhanced by 2 logs when the mfc was disconnected 70 similarly the expression levels of the sulii gene firstly increased and then decreased with the increased current density from 4 to 10 v in nutrient broth medium 69 consequently we hypothesize that low current could promote the abundance of args however the high electric current might eliminate args in the bes fig 4 yuan et al indicated that args persisted with their host arb which survived by respiring the available electron acceptors and electron shuttles in the bes 70 6 3 correlations between the arb and args in bes significant correlations were obtained between the reduction of arb and args indicating that the survival of arb is a crucial factor determining the presence of args 70 it was observed that bacteroiodetes and chloroflexi were negatively affected by args 72 according to the correlation between args and bacterial phyla the most likely potential host of the suli gene mainly belonged to armatimonadetes acidobacteria nitrospirae planctomycetes firmicutes or chlorobi 61 the potential hosts of args cmla flor suli mainly belonged to pseudomonas byssovorax and dechloromonas at different salinities 23 in addition arg abundances were significantly increased may be relevant to the decrease of bacterial community diversity 72 indicating that the change of bacterial diversity may be responsible for the abundance of args 6 4 possible mechanisms of args transfer as discussed above we hypothesized that electrical stimulation could promote arg transfer through vertical gene transfer vgt and horizontal gene transfer hgt between bacteria during antibiotic degradation in the bes fig 4 vgt is a contributor to the high abundance of args in the bes because selection influenced by residual antibiotics could result in more significant selective pressure and increased abundance of arb due to the availability of electron acceptors and electron shuttles 70 another contributor to the greater abundance of args is hgt 23 which might include conjugative transfer and extracellular arg transformation exposure to metabolic burden might significantly promote the conjugative transfer of args and the underlying mechanisms may involve enhanced cell membrane permeability ros response or altered expression of conjugative genes 73 75 when arb was killed or damaged however free args could be released and survive in the bes 76 in this case args transformation does not require an infective or viable donor bacterium and the receptor bacterium might efficiently uptake extracellular args within and across genera in the bes when stimulated by a current hence it is essential to note that the reduction of the args transformation capacity is crucial for the inhibition of arb dissemination 7 outlook bess combined electrochemical redox reduction and microbial metabolism which are regarded as promising treatments for emerging pollutants especially antibiotics this review raises questions regarding the potential role of bes for antibiotic removal and the consequent fate of args and arb in wastewater some issues are needed to be explored in further research 1 the variation of microbial diversity with antibiotic removal and arg abundance should be comprehensively explored due to the microbial diversity is directly related to the biodegradation of antibiotics and the abundance of args 2 co metabolism or direct oxidation process in the bes should be deeply studied which attributes to the degradation of antibiotics 3 args transfer process such as vgt and hgt is closely related to the promotion or elimination of args and arb hence the effect of current intensity and antibiotics on the args transfer is needed to be fully understood 8 conclusion the goal of this review is to summarize the advantages and disadvantages of bes for antibiotic removal the efficient removal of antibiotics occurs mainly due to faster oxidation through co metabolic degradation or direct oxidation by the anode in which the antibiotic is served as a sole electron donor in mfcs for the mecs a cathode can provide continuous electrons for the reduction of antibiotics the most abundant phylum in bes is proteobacteria the microbial communities and their relative abundances are affected by antibiotics and electric current antibiotics can be used as the sole carbon source for electricity generation in mfcs but the electricity generating activity of the microbial community could be inhibited by antibiotics therefore the relationship between antibiotics and electricity generation requires further investigation in addition a low electric current could promote arg transfer through vgt and hgt during antibiotic degradation in bes hopefully arb and args are eliminated with the high electric current this study raises questions regarding the potential role of bes for antibiotic removal and the reduction of args and arb further research is needed to elucidate the primary arg transfer mechanism and to fully understand the advantages of bess declaration of competing

13881,given its advantages in terms of high efficiency and low energy consumption bioelectrochemical system bes has been applied widely in the removal of various antibiotics from wastewater bes avoids the proliferation of antibiotic resistance genes args by producing less amount of sludge compared with wastewater treatment plants however transmembrane permeability and membrane potential can be affected by the electrical stimulation resulting in increases in the antibiotic resistant bacteria arb and args in bes based on limited published works available the main objective of this review is

mixture of 50 mg l 1 ceftriaxone sodium and 1000 mg l 1 glucose which is 6 fold higher than that with only1000 mg l 1 glucose in the mfc system 24 in addition when penicillin increased from 0 to 50 mg l 1 which resulted in higher maximum power density in an mfc fed glucose 34 antibiotics such as penicillin roxithromycin sulfadimidine and norfloxacin as co substrates might be metabolized by microorganism and consequently maintaining the mfc performance 34 35 in addition degradation product of antibiotic might be further consumed in mfc when the product was the nitrogen and carbon source 6 these results indicate that power production depends on the type of antibiotic and concentration as well as the co substrate penicillin might enhance the electron permeability of cell membranes and increase the release and activity of enzymes 40 giving rise to an increased direct electron transfer to outer cell membranes and consequently improving the mfc performance 34 however in another study zhang et al 39 demonstrated that an increased cfzs concentration to 100 mg l 1 caused a decrease of electricity production to 0 1 v in comparison the rise of cfzs concentration to 300 mg l 1 did not reduce the electricity production after long term operation of mfcs with 100 mg l 1 cfzs 39 as discussed in section 2 1 antibiotic acclimatization probably led to the generation of more antibiotic resistant microbial species and subsequently increased the antibiotic tolerance of mfcs in mfc process antibiotics could be served as electron mediators for enhancing electron transfer from exoelectrogens to the anode 41 in addition antibiotics could stimulate bioelectrocatalytic activity of anodic biofilm as well 42 nevertheless the maximum voltage was 157 mv after running for 40 h in the presence of 50 mg l 1 tc indicating that tc can be used as the sole substrate for electricity generation in mfcs 33 3 mecs for antibiotic removal 3 1 performance of antibiotic removal the performance of mecs in removing antibiotics has gained widespread attention in recent years table 2 since harnisch et al 43 utilized this technology to treat sulfonamides studies using mecs for the removal of cap 92 5 99 sulfonamide antibiotics 69 88 and tc 72 have been intensified table 2 mecs with different operational procedures and electrode configurations including the graphite fiber brush active carbon fiber and metal foam electrode have been illustrated in many studies table 2 the removal efficiency of cap is affected by the operating temperature of mecs cap degradation decreased notably upon switching from 25 c to 10 c 44 possibly due to a decrease in the cathode current generation due to the reduced operating temperature glucose metabolism by cathodophilic microbes in addition to the degradation of cap by extracellular electrons from the electrode was inhibited at low temperatures 44 3 2 potential for antibiotic removal the applied voltage was one of the most important factors in determining the degradation efficiency of antibiotics in mecs sulfadiazine sdz removal efficiency increased when the voltage was enhanced from 0 to 0 9 v in mecs 51 this result might be attributed to the stimulated bacterial activity and accelerated biofilm formation by the electric voltage 52 the cap removal efficiency tended to increase when a negative cathode potential of 1 25 v was applied thus a negative cathode potential can provide sufficient electrons to alter the microbial community 27 3 3 roles of biocathode for antibiotic removal biocathode plays an important factor in determining the removal of antibiotics for instance the removal efficiency of cap over 24 h was higher with a biocathode than with an abiotic cathode in mecs 46 in addition the cap removal efficiency dropped to 62 0 when the biocathode was disconnected 45 the initial current of the biocathode was 3 2 times higher than that of the abiotic cathode despite the similar cathode potentials of the two cathodes 45 the biocathode exhibited a high cap reduction rate likely because biocathode microorganisms could obtain electrons directly from the cathode and were involved in cap degradation 45 a biofilm on the cathode appears to facilitate mass transfer between the electrode and electrolyte 46 metal foams offer larger specific surface areas and have porous walls when compared with typical metal electrodes 53 the unique characteristics of metal foams can be used in electrodes to degrade antibiotics through electrochemical deposition wu et al investigated the degradation ability by using carbon rod removal efficiency 100 nickel foam removal efficiency 94 9 and copper foam removal efficiency 100 as cathodes to removal cap in mecs and found out copper foam exhibited desirable performance of complete degradation for cap 49 indicating that metal foams are a promising cathode material for antibiotic removal in mec 4 coupled system for antibiotic removal 4 1 summary of coupled system for antibiotic removal in terms of restoring the deteriorating environment traditional wastewater treatment technologies such as cw and mbr systems operating as standalone technologies which are insufficient 54 in recent years many coupled bes systems have been developed for antibiotic removal 55 these systems include an mfc sorption system coupled photo electrochemical catalysis in an mfc mfc pec or ec mbr mfc cw mfc and cw mfc mec table 3 yang et al developed a novel continuous flow mfc sorption system for tc removal and found out that high tc concentration high electrolyte concentration and low ph value could increase the tc adsorption capacity 56 this work also indicates that the increased numbers of mfcs connected in series could accelerate the removal efficiency of tc due to the higher current 56 however tc was adsorbed rather than degraded and further treatment requirements should be investigated in another study an mfc pec and mfc ec were constructed to degrade tc in the cathode chamber 57 bioelectricity assists with oxygen reduction compared with feo tio2 which forms reactive oxygen species ros to efficiently facilitate tc degradation and electricity generation 57 furthermore a new coupled mbr mfc system with filled granular activated carbon by doped feooh tio2 feooh tio2 gac was found to mitigate membrane fouling to achieve more than 90 tc hydrochloride removal this removal was due to oxygen reduction reactions proceeding along the 2e pathway and the formation of hydrogen peroxide 21 4 2 cw mfcs for antibiotic removal cw mfc as an emerging technology has recently attracted attention for antibiotic removal in a more recent study tc and smx were removed efficiently with tc exhibiting greater removal efficiency compared with smx in cw mfcs 58 60 additionally the sdz concentration was lower in a closed circuit mode cw mfc than in an open mode 61 this reduction was consistent with a series of biological and physicochemical processes such as substrate absorption electrode absorption microbial degradation desirable dehydrogenase activity plant uptake and hydrolysis which may be involved in antibiotic removal in cw mfcs 62 58 63 although antibiotics could be removed effectively by a single cw mfc and mec the risk of arg release when using this technology has received little attention in a cw mfc mec system the degradation of antibiotics was achieved by using bioelectricity generated from cw mfc without using external power 59 64 the mec has been used effectively as a pretreatment for antibiotics and the effluent can be used as the influent to a cw mfc for further degradation the coupled system has been shown to degrade high concentrations of smx 65 this result is unsurprising because a relatively stable electricity supply provided by the stacked cw mfcs could support the mecs for effective smx pretreatment 85 73 followed by further smx degradation by the cw mfcs 65 these coupled systems are efficient and energy saving for the removal of antibiotics without an external power supply 5 microbial community and activity in bes 5 1 predominant bacteria the predominant microbes including bacteria and methanogen may be directly related to the biodegradation of antibiotics and the abundance of args 8 the microbial community composition in the bes at the phylum level is summarized in fig 3 after incubation in the presence of antibiotics the six dominant phyla proteobacteria bacteroidetes clostridia actinobacteria firmicutes and chloroflexi in the bes were differing markedly compared with those in the open circuit and activated sludge groups fig 3 the proteobacteria was the most abundant phylum and included geobacter acinetobacter stenotrophomonas azoarcus aeromonas pseudomonas achromobacter alcaligenes and enterobacter in the bes 33 36 39 42 geobacter pseudomonas and alcaligenes are electrochemically active bacteria that responsible for electron transfer via cathode and anode 27 33 39 66 wang et al suggested that the enterobacter was most likely responsible for the biodegradation of tc in their mfc 33 in addition achromobacter pseudomonas and thauera have demonstrated the capability for smx degradation 36 38 cap degrading bacteria such as azoarcus pseudomonas comamonas rhodococcus chryseobacterium and nitrososphaera were also found in the bes 25 27 in conclusion the microbes of the mfc anode biofilm can be functionally categorized into two groups antibiotic degrading bacteria and exoelectrogens 25 complex interactions among these functional bacteria are crucial for antibiotic degradation and electricity generation in mfcs first the substrate was metabolized by exoelectrogens which were responsible for the current generation the electrons produced then accelerated the metabolic reactions of anaerobic bacteria 67 next bacteria with strong catabolic versatility may be developed to improve antibiotic removal 25 5 2 methanogenic communities methanogenic communities were analyzed to gain insight into the inhibitory effects of antibiotics on the performance of anaerobic reactors 26 27 the abundance of methylobacillus was altered in samples collected under different operating conditions of mecs 27 the relative abundances of vadinca11 and methanosarcina increased with increased voltage whereas methanosaeta and methanomassiliicoccus exhibited the opposite trend in the bes 26 a previous study revealed that homoacetogenesis coupled with hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis promoted anaerobic smx degradation in anaerobic reactors 1 in addition methylobacillus is capable of utilizing methanol and methylamine madhaiyan et al 2012 which may facilitate biodegradation of contaminants in mecs these findings suggest that functional methanogenic communities are important for antibiotic degradation but depend on the electrons in the system 26 27 5 3 roles of current for microbial communities previous results have indicated that the homeostasis of microbial communities could be affected by antibiotics and electrical stimulation 27 48 the main difference observed with differing initial cap concentrations was the distribution of the phyla proteobacteria bacteroidetes and firmicutes suggesting that the homeostasis of microbial community was affected by cap concentrations 27 in addition the abundance of proteobacteria gradually decreased as the cathode potential became less negative indicating that some specific species were enriched by electrical stimulation 27 this result is unsurprising because stimulation with the appropriate current resulted in increased dehydrogenase activity and cell proliferation 48 5 4 roles of organic matter and smx for microbial communities according to the results of principal coordinates analysis pcoa wang et al noted that biological samples tended to cluster together when mfcs were fed the same substrate acetate or smx 36 furthermore when the substrate was changed the diversity of the bacterial community decreased sharply 36 38 these results suggest that certain species are favored for the consumption of different substrates sodium acetate or smx and hence that the substrate affected the bacterial community structure in addition different operating modes mfc and abiotic control of mfcs could also strongly influence the diversity of the microbial community 36 6 fate of arb and args in bes anaerobic bess produce less sludge than wwtps which limits the proliferation of args in the process of sludge disposal 27 68 although antibiotics could be significantly removed in bes the risks of arb and args release using this technology have received little attention therefore the fate of arb and args in the bes is of significant significance fig 4 operating parameters such as cathodic potentials anode electrode antibiotics and their concentrations and dissolved oxygen have the potential to influence the occurrence and abundance of args and arb 27 48 69 70 yuan et al indicated that the average removal rate of tc and sulfonamide resistant e coli increased significantly when the bes was switched from high current to open circuit mode 70 in addition the bacterial density with 10 v direct voltage was 1 48 times higher than that of the control 0 v at 48 h in a bes 69 furthermore the abundances of chloramphenicol resistant bacteria crb at 1 25 v were more than 6 and 18 times higher than those at 1 v indicating that the abundances of crb increased with a more negative cathode potential 27 this is because the args persist with their host bacteria after surviving anode electrode and the electron shuttles excreted by exoelectrogens 70 however an 84 5 death rate of arb was observed in response to the application of 25 ma in a minimal nutrient medium which was caused by the excessive ros production under high electric current in bes 71 these results indicate that arb can be inhibited by using the proper electric current in the bes during the treatment of antibiotic residues 6 1 fate of arb in bes the promotion or elimination of arb may be caused by oxidative stress and adenosine triphosphate atp under electrical stimulation in bes it was seen that with the increased current density ros production in arb increased which suggested that ros were positively associated with the current compared with the open circuit mode lactic dehydrogenase ldh increased with an enhancement of current from 7 to 28 ma suggested that the current enhanced cell membrane permeability 69 antibiotics may enter the cell due to changes in cell membrane property under a strong electric field resulting in the death of bacteria without args thereby selectively increasing the abundance of arb 27 in addition the abundance of arb was enhanced due to the increase in atp concentration that occurred with the increased current 69 hence proper electric stimulation could enhance the levels of ros production membrane permeability and atp of arb however when the current increased by a specific range 28 ma excess ros production resulted in a decrease of arb 69 6 2 fate of args in bes compared with arb the fate of args in bes is quite complicated the expression of chloramphenicol resistance genes crgs decreased with more negative cathode potential in mec 27 in addition the abundance of args decreased by about 90 when the current was raised from 0 to 25 ma in mec 71 thus the application of current in bes treatment of antibiotic contaminated wastewater could be beneficial in contrast previous results indicated that electrical stimulation enhanced the abundance of args 61 the average removal rates of inti1 suli and tet e were enhanced by 2 logs when the mfc was disconnected 70 similarly the expression levels of the sulii gene firstly increased and then decreased with the increased current density from 4 to 10 v in nutrient broth medium 69 consequently we hypothesize that low current could promote the abundance of args however the high electric current might eliminate args in the bes fig 4 yuan et al indicated that args persisted with their host arb which survived by respiring the available electron acceptors and electron shuttles in the bes 70 6 3 correlations between the arb and args in bes significant correlations were obtained between the reduction of arb and args indicating that the survival of arb is a crucial factor determining the presence of args 70 it was observed that bacteroiodetes and chloroflexi were negatively affected by args 72 according to the correlation between args and bacterial phyla the most likely potential host of the suli gene mainly belonged to armatimonadetes acidobacteria nitrospirae planctomycetes firmicutes or chlorobi 61 the potential hosts of args cmla flor suli mainly belonged to pseudomonas byssovorax and dechloromonas at different salinities 23 in addition arg abundances were significantly increased may be relevant to the decrease of bacterial community diversity 72 indicating that the change of bacterial diversity may be responsible for the abundance of args 6 4 possible mechanisms of args transfer as discussed above we hypothesized that electrical stimulation could promote arg transfer through vertical gene transfer vgt and horizontal gene transfer hgt between bacteria during antibiotic degradation in the bes fig 4 vgt is a contributor to the high abundance of args in the bes because selection influenced by residual antibiotics could result in more significant selective pressure and increased abundance of arb due to the availability of electron acceptors and electron shuttles 70 another contributor to the greater abundance of args is hgt 23 which might include conjugative transfer and extracellular arg transformation exposure to metabolic burden might significantly promote the conjugative transfer of args and the underlying mechanisms may involve enhanced cell membrane permeability ros response or altered expression of conjugative genes 73 75 when arb was killed or damaged however free args could be released and survive in the bes 76 in this case args transformation does not require an infective or viable donor bacterium and the receptor bacterium might efficiently uptake extracellular args within and across genera in the bes when stimulated by a current hence it is essential to note that the reduction of the args transformation capacity is crucial for the inhibition of arb dissemination 7 outlook bess combined electrochemical redox reduction and microbial metabolism which are regarded as promising treatments for emerging pollutants especially antibiotics this review raises questions regarding the potential role of bes for antibiotic removal and the consequent fate of args and arb in wastewater some issues are needed to be explored in further research 1 the variation of microbial diversity with antibiotic removal and arg abundance should be comprehensively explored due to the microbial diversity is directly related to the biodegradation of antibiotics and the abundance of args 2 co metabolism or direct oxidation process in the bes should be deeply studied which attributes to the degradation of antibiotics 3 args transfer process such as vgt and hgt is closely related to the promotion or elimination of args and arb hence the effect of current intensity and antibiotics on the args transfer is needed to be fully understood 8 conclusion the goal of this review is to summarize the advantages and disadvantages of bes for antibiotic removal the efficient removal of antibiotics occurs mainly due to faster oxidation through co metabolic degradation or direct oxidation by the anode in which the antibiotic is served as a sole electron donor in mfcs for the mecs a cathode can provide continuous electrons for the reduction of antibiotics the most abundant phylum in bes is proteobacteria the microbial communities and their relative abundances are affected by antibiotics and electric current antibiotics can be used as the sole carbon source for electricity generation in mfcs but the electricity generating activity of the microbial community could be inhibited by antibiotics therefore the relationship between antibiotics and electricity generation requires further investigation in addition a low electric current could promote arg transfer through vgt and hgt during antibiotic degradation in bes hopefully arb and args are eliminated with the high electric current this study raises questions regarding the potential role of bes for antibiotic removal and the reduction of args and arb further research is needed to elucidate the primary arg transfer mechanism and to fully understand the advantages of bess declaration of competing

quantities of wastewater is generated by industrial and domestic sectors posing a great challenge to conventional treatment methods owing to the complex nature of the effluents and presence of recalcitrant compounds therefore comprehensive treatment of wastewater originating from domestic commercial and industrial sources has gained tremendous attention throughout the world due to the severe environmental problems associated with disposal 1 the coffee industry uses large quantities of water for the production of coffee powder in various stages of processing and generates around 40 45 l of wastewater per kilogram of product the wastewater discharged by the coffee processing industry contains high concentration of pollutants including acidity odor color turbidity total dissolved solids tds and chemical oxygen demand cod various researchers have studied treatment of coffee industrial effluent by applying different techniques zayas et al 3 investigated chemical flocculation and advanced oxidation processes for removal of color turbidity and cod by about 87 from coffee wastewater according to selvamurugan et al 4 cod was reduced by 61 and 68 6 from coffee effluent using anaerobic and aerobic bioreactors respectively maike et al 5 removed 87 cod from coffee processing wastewater employing a continuously aerated bioreactor the maximum reductions of cod and color were found to be 75 and 91 respectively using batch electrochemical coagulation with stainless steel ss and iron fe electrodes to process coffee industrial wastewater by sahana et al 6 veymar et al 2019 7 used anaerobic baffled bioreactor coupled with microfiltration process for treatment of wet coffee effluent and achieved 81 decrease in cod and 61 in case of tds from literature survey it was found that coffee wastewater was treated by various conventional techniques such as electrochemical coagulation flocculation and oxidation under anaerobic and aerobic conditions which require more footprint high energy consumption and huge operation and maintenance costs however very few studies have been conducted on membrane based technologies creating scope for using modern techniques such as membrane bioreactor mbr to treat the coffee industrial wastewater ciww further to reduce the huge load of contaminants the mbr can be integrated with conventional or even other membrane processes the advantages of using mbr include simplicity of design cost effective nature technical feasibility and economical viability in producing high quality of treated water for reuse in the present study an

india the solvent dimethylformamide dmf and crosslinker glutaraldehyde were purchased from m s finar ltd ahmedabad india membrane thickness was measured by dial thickness gauge obtained from m s baker

the ph and electrical conductivity ec of the sample collected from a local coffee industry for the present study were noted to be 4 98 and 1 5 ms cm correspondingly the sample was neutralized to 7 ph by the addition of 0 1 n naoh 15 the tds cod and turbidity were recorded to be 1520 mg l 20 000 mg l and 1100 fau respectively with strong awful odor and dark brown color the initial cod color and turbidity concentrations in the effluent were very high and needed an efficient but economical process configuration to attain permissible limits for gardening irrigation and cleaning uses as prescribed by the cpcb 2 2 experimental methodology 2 2 1 synthesis of the membrane a combination of 23 pes 2 pva 0 5 glutaraldehyde crosslinker was dissolved in proportionate amount of 74 5 ml w v dmf solvent at room temperature of 28 2 c for 3 h under stirring on a magnetic plate pva was added to enhance hydrophilicity and thereby overall water flux by the introduction of oh functional groups in the porous hydrophobic pes membrane which mainly consists of aromatic rings connected to hydrophilic sulfone group an automated casting machine was used to cast the resultant bubble free solution on a non woven polyester fabric support which was already affixed on a clean glass plate the film was then immediately immersed in an ice cold water bath to obtain a high flux ultraporous membrane of uniform thickness of 45 µm as measured by a dial microgauge the hf uf membrane thus obtained was found to have molecular weight cut off of 5 kda and contant angle of 27 respectively leaching out of pva was studied by soaking the membrane for 72 h in deionized water and noting the weight change of the dried film the weight of the polymer was found to be more or less constant indicating that the pva was strongly held within the pes matrix by crosslinking with glutaraldehyde 2 2 2 integrated membrane bioreactor imbr mixed bacterial culture was isolated from a soil sample collected from the council of scientific and industrial research indian institute of chemical technology csir iict hyderabad garden 1 gm of the soil sample was mixed in 10 ml of deionized water and serially diluted from 10 to 10 10 of original concentration simultaneously nutrient agar was prepared by dissolving 5 0 g of peptone 1 5 g of hm peptone b 1 5 g of yeast extract 5 0 g of sodium chloride and 15 g of agar in 1 l of deionized water by maintaining ph at 7 4 0 2 the nutrient agar was sterilized in an autoclave at 121 c and 15 lbs pressure for 1 h after attaining room temperature the sterile media was poured into the agar plates in a laminar airflow chamber further the diluted sample was spread on the nutrient agar plates and incubated at 28 c for 24 h the colonies appeared after 24 h on the plate at 10 5 of diluted concentration which could be transferred to the nutrient broth the culture flask with the effluent was subjected to incubation at 28 c for 72 h under constant agitation of 150 rpm the mixed microbial culture exhibited good growth in the effluent sample causing substantial reduction in cod which encouraged the use of the isolated microbial culture in further experiments selection of an appropriate microbial consortia is the primary requirement for attempting degradation of cod in the coffee effluent the isolated mixed microbial culture from the soil sample effectively reduced the levels of pollutant parameters the mixed microbial consortium showed good efficiency in the degradation of pollutants as compared to single bacterial culture in the bioreactor process 16 two different types of membranes were used for ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis applicaions within the imbr hf uf membrane of 5 kda mwco was developed in the laboratory and scaled up into spiral wound module of 1 2 m2 effective area with a standard water flow rate of 75 gallons per day gpd with the help of m s permionics membranes pvt ltd vadodara gujarat this was used for ultrafiltration of the side stream coming from the mbr thin film composite reverse osmosis membranes tfc ro based on aromatic polyamide of varying membrane areas viz 0 3 m2 of 75 gpd flow rate and 1 2 m2 of 300 gpd were purchased from svs water solutions hyderabad india these membranes differed in their polymer compositions and internal properties with detailed specifications provided in table 1 three different tanks namely feed or reactor tank t i intermediate tank t ii and product tank t iii were used in the experiments a schematic of the experimental setup is shown in fig 1 a where the feed reactor tank t i shown in red color contains coffee effluent and mixed microbial consortia the reactor was operated for 15 days with constant aeration at 3 l min using a small aerator model ap 208a 2 5 w capacity venus aqua air pumps hyderabad india at atmospheric temperature the reactor tank was connected to a side stream hf uf membrane module with a flow line attached to the diaphragm pump after 15 days permeate water from the hf uf membrane was collected in an intermediate tank t ii represented by yellow color bubbles in fig 1 a indicating the appearance of permissible quality for safe disposal the treated water from the intermediate tank t ii was further processed through the tfc ro membrane and the final product was collected in a product tank t iii which is represented in green color bubbles in fig 1 a to project its suitability for recycle as it meets the norms fixed by the cpcb the water samples were collected at every 5 days interval from t i for characterization experiments were performed with two different effluent volumes of 2 l and 20 l each using the imbr process the details of each trial are explained in the form of case studies 2 2 3 case study for 2 l and 20 l capacity experimental trials with aerobic imbr imbr trials were performed using the feed reactor tank t i of 5 l maximum capacity in which 2 l of effluent sample and 100 ml of mixed microbial consortia were added the dimensions of the 5 l reactor tank t i were 40 cm 13 cm 20 cm a 25 l capacity feed tank t i was similarly employed for processing 20 l of coffee effluent added with 1000 ml of mixed microbial consortia the dimensions of the 25 l reactor tank were noted to be 50 cm 13 cm 40 cm in both cases the reactor t i was connected to a side stream hf uf membrane module with the outlet flow line attached to a diaphragm pump for generating positive pressure on the membrane while the tank was kept under constant aeration in the case of 2 l batch a pressure of 4 kg cm 2 produced a permeate flow rate of 1 7 l h at ambient temperature 28 2 c on the other hand for 20 l batch a flow rate of 17 l h was attained at the same pressure and temperature in both cases the wastewater level in the bioreactor was maintained constant in order to keep the hydraulic retention time hrt at a value of 15 days permeate from t i was collected into an intermittent tank t ii for the ro process 1 7 l of permeate from the 2 l batch and 17 l of permeate from 20 l batch were recovered and stored in the respective intermittent tanks t ii for further processing by ro the respective permeates from t ii were subjected to ro at a pressure of 6 kg cm 2 and 1 25 l from 2 l and correspondingly 13 l from 20 l original feed batches were the final water quantities recovered the product water from the ro process was collected in a separate tank t iii both 2 l and 20 l experimental trials were performed for 15 days to allow microbial consortium sufficient time to degrade the cod samples collected from tanks t i t ii and t iii were analyzed to assess the efficiency of treatment the experiments were conducted in triplicate to reduce the error values from studies 2 2 4 membrane cleaning soon after the termination of the experiment on the basis of very low flux the membrane modules were subjected to cleaning with tap water at a pressure of 2 kg cm 2 chemical cleaning of the membrane was then performed by treating with 1 of citric acid for 15 min to remove mineral scales and metal precipitates followed by water wash for 10 min the membrane was further cleaned with a mixture of 1 sodium hydroxide naoh 0 5 ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid edta and 0 1 of sodium lauryl sulfate sls for 15 min to dislodge stubborn organic foulants followed by a water wash again for 10 min as a consequence of the above cleaning protocols the scales formed on the membrane were completely removed and 99 of the original flux was restored 17 20 during shut down the membrane was stored in 0 5 w v sodium metabisulfite smbs aqueous solution to prevent biological fouling in the present paper the same membrane and operating conditions were used for 2 l and 20 l capacity feeds 2 2 5 morphological analysis by sem the surface and cross sectional morphologies of hf uf 5 kda membrane were carried out using hitachi s2150 scanning electron microscope sem purchased from japan the membranes were cut into the desired size under liquid nitrogen conditions to obtain a smooth cross section the samples were coated with gold sputtering using a sputter coater and subjected to sem analysis at 10 kv potential the surface and cross sectional images were magnified to determine the characteristics of the pva blended pes on polyester non woven fabric support 2 2 6 analytical methods effluent from a local coffee industry was collected in a closed container and analyzed for different physicochemical parameters like ph tds turbidity electrical conductivity ec cod color and odor 21 the ph and ec of the samples were measured using ph model dcm 900 and conductivity model dph 504 meters purchased from global electronics hyderabad india respectively tds was determined using a hm digital meter mg l units supplied by svs water solutions hyderabad india turbidity and color of the samples were measured using a colorimeter of model dr 890 hach bengaluru india in units of formazin attenuation unit fau and color intensity in platinum cobalt pt co units respectively 2 2 7 calculation of flux retention and cod the membrane performance can be evaluated by calculating the flux retention and cod as follows the flux was calculated using the following equation 1 p e r m e a t e f l u x j v o l u m e o f p e r m e a t e v m e m b r a n e a r e a a x t i m e t where the units of the flux membrane area volume and time are l m2 h m2 l and h respectively the retention was calculated by the equation 2 r 1 c p c f x 100 where r is retention cp and cf are conductivity of permeate and feed respectively the cod of the feed and permeate samples were calculated as follows 4 c o d m g l b s n 8000 d f v where b amount of ferrous ammonium sulfate fas consumed for blank sample s amount of fas consumed for sample n normality of fas 8000 equivalent weight of oxygen per liter v volume of a sample taken in ml d f dilution factor 3 results and discussion 3 1 scanning electron microscopy the surface and cross sectional sem morphologies of the hf uf 5 kda membrane are provided in fig 2 a and b fig 2 a indicates the presence of micropores of pva polymeric membrane uniformly distributed throughout the surface of the pes layer without any agglomerations which are clearly visible at 10 µm magnification of the image from fig 2 b the pva polymer effectively blended with ultraporous pes layer moreover the pva pes blend was found to interpenetrate through microvoids of the polyester nonwoven fabric support as evident at 200 µm magnification of the two layered structure therefore pva was successfully blended with pes as proven by both morphological views 22 3 2 effect of microbial consortia in effluent treatment the indigenous microbial consortia was found responsible for different biochemical reactions present to enable degradation of the organic matter from 20 000 to 40 mg l 99 in the coffee industrial wastewater to attain permissible limits under cpcb for discharge into the environment cod 250 mg l 4 color reduction was nearly 50 as recorded after an incubation period of 10 days under constant shaking condition the influence of bacterial consortia affected a change in ph from 7 0 to 9 0 at temperature 30 2 c fig 4 illustrates the removal of color with time there was no significant change in percentage removal of cod after 6 days after which a significant reduction was observed the cod removal was found to be nearly 40 while turbidity decreased by 36 after an incubation period of 15 days under continuous aeration and recirculation 3 3 integrated membrane bioreactor operation for 2 l and 20 l batches the results for imbr based processing of 2 l and 20 l batch sizes of coffee industrial effluent reveal a significant reduction in all parameters the detailed observations are provided in table 2 the acidic ph of 4 98 of the effluent was adjusted to neutral followed by the addition of microbial consortia isolated from the soil sample in the bioreactor there was no further change observed in ph value up to 5 days of exposure in the bioreactor interestingly after the fifth day there was a sudden increase in ph value from 8 to 8 89 in t ii after the mbr process and up to and 8 92 in t iii after ro treatment however after 15 days the ph value decreased to 8 86 in t ii and 8 60 in t iii cod value in the coffee industrial effluent was higher than that specified by the cpcb during the experiments with 2 l and 20 l batch sizes up to a period of 5 days there was no reduction in cod values a decline in cod value could be seen only on the sixth day due to the stabilization of the microbial consortia isolated from the soil sample the microbes in the bioreactor gradually acclimatized and consumed the substrate comprising of organics and other nutrients available in the effluent after 10 days of operating time the cod value decreased from 20 000 mg l to 18 000 for 2 l batch and to 17 000 mg l for 20 l batch in t ii of mbr treatment post ro treatment the cod further lowered to 3000 and 2650 mg l in t iii for the two different batch capacities a considerable decline in cod values was observed after the 15th day to values in the range of 12 000 and 13 000 mg l in t ii and finally as low as 40 and 60 mg l in t iii respectively the final cod values were thus observed to be 40 mg l for 2 l batch feed and 60 mg l for 20 l batch feed as seen in fig 3 b these values exhibit a great improvement over the data reported for treatment of coffee effluent by haddis and devi in 2008 23 where cod was reduced from 25 600 mg l to15 780 mg l for disposal into downstream water bodies other literature exhibited a reduction from 19 840 mg l to 11 200 mg l cod for 1 l batch of wastewater of coffee grounds using biochar as adsorbent 24 according to asha and kumar 2015 25 a study for coffee industrial wastewater with 1 l batch of coffee arabica using aluminum electrodes in an electrochemical process revealed a cod reduction from 12 840 to 618 mg l the results shown in table 2 indicate that tds and turbidity reduction were observed after 5 days of treatment in the bioreactor from the sixth day onwards the reduction can be seen in the bioreactor due to the activity of the microbial consortia on the effluent after 10 days the reduction in tds and turbidity values for 2 l and 20 l batches subjected to imbr process were observed as 1250 and 1325 mg l of tds 850 and 900 fau of turbidity correspondingly in t ii of mbr which got further reduced to 576 and 550 mg l 530 and 550 fau respectively in t iii after ro an additional 5 days of extra exposure to constitute a total duration of 15 days resulted in further reduction of tds to 1050 and 1150 mg l and turbidity to 720 and 700 fau in t ii with the imbr process at 2 l and 20 l batch sizes respectively as shown in fig 3 a tds was furthermore reduced to 357 and 360 mg l with nil turbidity after passing through the ro membrane the presence of a high level of tds was due to organic and inorganic matter present in the effluent after the treatment process a low level of tds was recorded in cases of both 2 l and 20 l batches with attainment of acceptable limits a similar reduction in tds from 2538 to 1258 mg l was reported by venkata swamy and co authors in 2016 26 using nanofiltration nf membrane for treatment of 30 l biscuit industrial effluent our study claims a substantial reduction in cod from 20 000 mg l to 40 mg l for 2 l batch and 60 mg l for 20 l batch size besides a final value of zero turbidity using the imbr process in treating coffee wastewater it is worth mentioning that the imbr process is safe and effective compared to earlier studies and provides an acceptable range of parameters set by the cpcb with 71 recovery of quality water for reuse the technology possesses a triple action process i e biological reaction linked with dual membrane technique thus the study suggests that the imbr process can be considered as an advanced way to deal with complicated effluents the ro permeate can be recycled back to the plant for reuse in various utilities like washing cleaning or even plantation etc the ro reject is highly concentrated in all pollutants therefore in case 1 the reject water could be subjected to anaerobic digestion in the form of a slurry after addition of microbial consortia whereas in case 2 the obtained sludge from mbr would be fed to an anaerobic gas chamber to generate biogas as a byproduct for cooking purposes fig 1 a the retentate i e remaining sludge is collected and sent to a solid waste management plant for biogas generation with high methane content 27 the scale up ratio from 2 l to 20 l effluent batch showed consistent performance with pollutant reduction being gradual for 10 days of treatment but accelerating after 15 days with a drastic reduction in all parameters that displays the effectiveness of the imbr technology in meeting the norms of environmental safety 3 4 effect of operating time on volumetric flux membrane performance was evaluated by calculating the volumetric flux against operating time during the treatment of 2 l and 20 l feed effluent batches by hf uf tank ii and ro tank iii membranes in cycle 1 of 10 days duration and cycle 2 of 15 days time period in cycle 1 shown in fig 4 a when hf uf membrane was subjected to a pressure of 4 kg cm 2 the volumetric flux decreased from 73 51 l m2 h to 40 84 l m2 h across an operating time of 0 54 8 33 min for 2 l batch while it reduced from 86 58 l m2 h to 39 16 l m2 h over a time period of 0 58 21 71 min for 20 l batch size from fig 4 b for ro the flux is seen to lower from 100 to 74 41 l m2 h for 2 l batch and from 93 75 to 67 01 l m2 h for 20 l batch across corresponding operating times of 0 2 4 40 min and 0 53 9 75 min at an operating pressure of 6 kg cm 2 further after cleaning of membranes in cycle 2 15 days the hf uf membrane flux was found to decline from 62 32 to 40 23 l m2 h within 8 45 min for 2 l batch and from 81 21 to 39 04 l m2 h in 21 71 min for 20 l batch respectively as seen in fig 4 c on the other hand flux of the effluent through ro membrane reduced from 92 95 to 56 35 l m2 h for 2 l batch in 9 85 min and from 99 5 to 72 35 l m2 h in 4 95 min for 20 l batch respectively as seen in fig 4 d the retention in cycle 1 was observed to be 17 8 and 12 8 in case of hf uf membrane and 62 1 and 63 8 for ro for 2 l and 20 l batches respectively on the other hand in case of cycle 2 the retention was 30 9 for 2 l batch and 24 3 for 20 l batch for hf uf membrane while corresponding values for ro were observed to be 76 5 and 76 3 respectively post membrane cleaning the declination in both flux and retention for 2 l and 20 l batch processes in cycles 1 and 2 could be considered negligible as the scales on the membrane surface were efficiently dislodged by the reagents used in the washing solutions thus the volumetric flux declination study exhibits that the hf uf and ro membranes have been conjectured to possess lower fouling propensity the membranes could be washed thoroughly with acidic citric acid and alkaline edta naoh solutions after each batch experiment the washing protocols followed in this study comprehensively removed inorganic and organic foulants from the membrane surface to enhance performance and lifespan of both ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis membranes 3 5 effect of membrane cleaning cycle on pure water flux membrane performance depends upon the number of cleaning cycles which affects the pure water flux after chemical washing of the hf uf and ro membanes after each cycle of effluent treatment the pure water flux was recorded to understand cleaning efficiency fig 5 a for 2 l batch size reveals the pure water flux of hf uf membrane to decrease from 114 89 l m2 h to 108 64 l m2 h in cycle 1 and to a value of 102 12 l m2 h in cycle 2 in case of ro the original pure water flux of 89 12 l m2 h reduced to 85 65 l m2 h in cycle 1 and in case of cycle 2 it lowered to 82 05 l m2 h similarly fig 5 b representing 20 l batch experiments depicts the original pure water flux of hf uf and ro membranes to be 135 82 l m2 h and 110 13 l m2 h respectively the values after membrane cleaning in cycles 1 and 2 reduced to 120 16 l m2 h and 116 68 l m2 h for hf uf membrane while those corresponding to ro membrane lowered to 106 12 l m2 h in cycle 1 and 102 65 l m2 h in cycle 2 fig 6 3 6 removal of color and odor separation of color and odor from effluents is critical and essential for enhancement of quality of the treated water earlier studies performed on the removal of color from industrial effluents using membranes 28 29 or activated carbon adsorbent by hang and woodams in 1979 30 report low reduction the hf uf and ro membranes were found to be highly effective for color removal from coffee wastewater in the present work the novel imbr process reports 100 removal in color from dark brown to colorless and odor from strong pungent to an acceptable range there was only a slight change in color after 10 days of operation whereas transparent water with acceptable odor was observed after 15 days of imbr which involved post treatment by ro the visual change in color obtained in this study is shown in fig 5 after imbr experiments were completed in 15 days chemical cleaning of the membrane was done to restore the flux by removal of foulants observations made from this cleaning protocol of this process support a similar study by hong and elimelech in 1997 31 the cleaning protocol adopted in the present study has helped in using the membrane for multiple cycles of operation with an enhanced life span though wastewater treatment is a challenging task in this era of zero liquid discharge zld the present study proves that the imbr process is technically feasible and economically viable in meeting the permissible limits established by cpcb for reuse or discharge of treated effluent into water bodies 3 7 economics of integrated membrane bioreactor process the activated sludge process asp requires huge space high energy and more manpower when comparing to the membrane processes which is a one time investment to obtain good quality of water for reuse in various applications to reduce fresh water consumption to determine economic feasibility a cost analysis was carried out and a statement of expenditure was prepared for 1000 l h capacity pilot plant as projected in table 2 cost analysis for the present study accounts for a complete list of expenses incurred during the execution of the experiments venkata swamy et al 2016 25 made a cost analysis for processing 1000 l h of biscuit industrial effluent by nf membrane and reported a capital investment of 4387 usd inr 2 80 lacs sarker and sarkar 2018 32 implemented cost analysis for chemical and paint manufacturing industrial effluents the etp plant cost component of the chemical facility was 16 667 and for paint facility about 39 103 in the current work the capital investment for a 1000 l h capacity has been projected to be 9512 usd inr 6 5 lacs a detailed spreadsheet of this estimate along with the operation and maintenance costs are presented in tables 3 and 4 respectively the water recovery was considered as 71 after the imbr process for 20 h of operating time of mbr and 15 h of ro per day the duration of membrane module replacement was considered to be 3 years cleaning in place cip is an important factor for ensuring long membrane life in all etps the cost of membrane cleaning could add up to 20 30 of total operational costs 33 3 8 comparison of present work with literature results observed during the present work with respect to various parameters such as cod tds color and turbidity are compared with existing data in the literature table 5 depicts the treatment of coffee effluent using imbr to have effectively removed 99 cod 100 color and turbidity and 76 tds compared to other conventional methods stand alone membrane and other integrated membrane processes therefore the current process is technically feasible economically viable environmentally clean with inherent safety in operating protocols 34 4 conclusions the performance of an integrated membrane bioreactor process using aerobic reactor manned with a side stream high flux ultrafiltration membrane followed by reverse osmosis as a post treatment has shown optimum performance for the treatment of coffee industrial effluent the configuration is highly feasible for upscaling due to the easy availability of aerobic reactors of robust design as well as advanced versions of ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis membranes the imbr process acquires the 3 es quality of being easy effective and economical and presents itself as a superior technique for removal of 100 of the turbidity color and odor present in coffee effluent accompanied by 99 reduction in chemical oxygen demand and 76 of total dissolved solids imbr appears to be an excellent tool for extending its implementation in the treatment ofother challenging industrial effluents like textiles distillery and tanneries the recovered water obtained from imbr configuration meets the acceptable range of 250 mg l cod and 5 5 9 0 ph specified by the central pollution control board government of india as per the norms the coffee processing industry falls under the orange category of schedule i industries and the reclaimed water can be used in various applications such as industrial utilities domestic purpose gardening and ground water recharge membrane cleaning protocols involving acidic and alkaline washing ensured efficient control of fouling with nearly complete restoration of original pure water flux effluent flux and retention values the reject contains a minimum quantity of slurry that could be subjected to anaerobic digestion to facilitate biogas production with solid sludge landfill for disposal to ensure a safe

quantities of wastewater is generated by industrial and domestic sectors posing a great challenge to conventional treatment methods owing to the complex nature of the effluents and presence of recalcitrant compounds therefore comprehensive treatment of wastewater originating from domestic commercial and industrial sources has gained tremendous attention throughout the world due to the severe environmental problems associated with disposal 1 the coffee industry uses large quantities of water for the production of coffee powder in various stages of processing and generates around 40 45 l of wastewater per kilogram of product the wastewater discharged by the coffee processing industry contains high concentration of pollutants including acidity odor color turbidity total dissolved solids tds and chemical oxygen demand cod various researchers have studied treatment of coffee industrial effluent by applying different techniques zayas et al 3 investigated chemical flocculation and advanced oxidation processes for removal of color turbidity and cod by about 87 from coffee wastewater according to selvamurugan et al 4 cod was reduced by 61 and 68 6 from coffee effluent using anaerobic and aerobic bioreactors respectively maike et al 5 removed 87 cod from coffee processing wastewater employing a continuously aerated bioreactor the maximum reductions of cod and color were found to be 75 and 91 respectively using batch electrochemical coagulation with stainless steel ss and iron fe electrodes to process coffee industrial wastewater by sahana et al 6 veymar et al 2019 7 used anaerobic baffled bioreactor coupled with microfiltration process for treatment of wet coffee effluent and achieved 81 decrease in cod and 61 in case of tds from literature survey it was found that coffee wastewater was treated by various conventional techniques such as electrochemical coagulation flocculation and oxidation under anaerobic and aerobic conditions which require more footprint high energy consumption and huge operation and maintenance costs however very few studies have been conducted on membrane based technologies creating scope for using modern techniques such as membrane bioreactor mbr to treat the coffee industrial wastewater ciww further to reduce the huge load of contaminants the mbr can be integrated with conventional or even other membrane processes the advantages of using mbr include simplicity of design cost effective nature technical feasibility and economical viability in producing high quality of treated water for reuse in the present study an integrated membrane bioreactor imbr process involving side stream ultrafiltration uf followed by reverse osmosis ro as post treatment exhibited effective reduction in tds from 1520 to 360 mg l and cod from 20 000 mg l to 40 mg l the color of wastewater was completely removed while ph was enhanced from 4 98 to 8 60 to enable reuse in the same industry feed and treated samples were analyzed as per the apha standard methods 8 9 the recovered water was found to meet the norms specified by the central pollution control board cpcb new delhi government of india for further use in irrigation

mwco were prepared from polyethersulfone pes purchased from solvay vadodara india polyvinyl alcohol pva used as a hydrophilic additive to prepare pes membrane was procured from loba chemie mumbai india the solvent dimethylformamide dmf and crosslinker glutaraldehyde were purchased from m s finar ltd ahmedabad india membrane thickness was measured by dial thickness gauge obtained from m s baker ltd gujarat india 2 1 qualitative characteristics of coffee industrial effluent the wastewater from a coffee processing industry is generally acidic with ph varying between 3 5 4 5 13 or 3 8 4 11 14 the ph and electrical conductivity ec of the sample collected from a local coffee industry for the present study were noted to be 4 98 and 1 5 ms cm correspondingly the sample was neutralized to 7 ph by the addition of 0 1 n naoh 15 the tds cod and turbidity were recorded to be 1520 mg l 20 000 mg l and 1100 fau respectively with strong awful odor and dark brown color the initial cod color and turbidity concentrations in the effluent were very high and needed an efficient but economical process configuration to attain permissible limits for gardening irrigation and cleaning uses as prescribed by the cpcb 2 2 experimental methodology 2 2 1 synthesis of the membrane a combination of 23 pes 2 pva 0 5 glutaraldehyde crosslinker was dissolved in proportionate amount of 74 5 ml w v dmf solvent at room temperature of 28 2 c for 3 h under stirring on a magnetic plate pva was added to enhance hydrophilicity and thereby overall water flux by the introduction of oh functional groups in the porous hydrophobic pes membrane which mainly consists of aromatic rings connected to hydrophilic sulfone group an automated casting machine was used to cast the resultant bubble free solution on a non woven polyester fabric support which was already affixed on a clean glass plate the film was then immediately immersed in an ice cold water bath to obtain a high flux ultraporous membrane of uniform thickness of 45 µm as measured by a dial microgauge the hf uf membrane thus obtained was found to have molecular weight cut off of 5 kda and contant angle of 27 respectively leaching out of pva was studied by soaking the membrane for 72 h in deionized water and noting the weight change of the dried film the weight of the polymer was found to be more or less constant indicating that the pva was strongly held within the pes matrix by crosslinking with glutaraldehyde 2 2 2 integrated membrane bioreactor imbr mixed bacterial culture was isolated from a soil sample collected from the council of scientific and industrial research indian institute of chemical technology csir iict hyderabad garden 1 gm of the soil sample was mixed in 10 ml of deionized water and serially diluted from 10 to 10 10 of original concentration simultaneously nutrient agar was prepared by dissolving 5 0 g of peptone 1 5 g of hm peptone b 1 5 g of yeast extract 5 0 g of sodium chloride and 15 g of agar in 1 l of deionized water by maintaining ph at 7 4 0 2 the nutrient agar was sterilized in an autoclave at 121 c and 15 lbs pressure for 1 h after attaining room temperature the sterile media was poured into the agar plates in a laminar airflow chamber further the diluted sample was spread on the nutrient agar plates and incubated at 28 c for 24 h the colonies appeared after 24 h on the plate at 10 5 of diluted concentration which could be transferred to the nutrient broth the culture flask with the effluent was subjected to incubation at 28 c for 72 h under constant agitation of 150 rpm the mixed microbial culture exhibited good growth in the effluent sample causing substantial reduction in cod which encouraged the use of the isolated microbial culture in further experiments selection of an appropriate microbial consortia is the primary requirement for attempting degradation of cod in the coffee effluent the isolated mixed microbial culture from the soil sample effectively reduced the levels of pollutant parameters the mixed microbial consortium showed good efficiency in the degradation of pollutants as compared to single bacterial culture in the bioreactor process 16 two different types of membranes were used for ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis applicaions within the imbr hf uf membrane of 5 kda mwco was developed in the laboratory and scaled up into spiral wound module of 1 2 m2 effective area with a standard water flow rate of 75 gallons per day gpd with the help of m s permionics membranes pvt ltd vadodara gujarat this was used for ultrafiltration of the side stream coming from the mbr thin film composite reverse osmosis membranes tfc ro based on aromatic polyamide of varying membrane areas viz 0 3 m2 of 75 gpd flow rate and 1 2 m2 of 300 gpd were purchased from svs water solutions hyderabad india these membranes differed in their polymer compositions and internal properties with detailed specifications provided in table 1 three different tanks namely feed or reactor tank t i intermediate tank t ii and product tank t iii were used in the experiments a schematic of the experimental setup is shown in fig 1 a where the feed reactor tank t i shown in red color contains coffee effluent and mixed microbial consortia the reactor was operated for 15 days with constant aeration at 3 l min using a small aerator model ap 208a 2 5 w capacity venus aqua air pumps hyderabad india at atmospheric temperature the reactor tank was connected to a side stream hf uf membrane module with a flow line attached to the diaphragm pump after 15 days permeate water from the hf uf membrane was collected in an intermediate tank t ii represented by yellow color bubbles in fig 1 a indicating the appearance of permissible quality for safe disposal the treated water from the intermediate tank t ii was further processed through the tfc ro membrane and the final product was collected in a product tank t iii which is represented in green color bubbles in fig 1 a to project its suitability for recycle as it meets the norms fixed by the cpcb the water samples were collected at every 5 days interval from t i for characterization experiments were performed with two different effluent volumes of 2 l and 20 l each using the imbr process the details of each trial are explained in the form of case studies 2 2 3 case study for 2 l and 20 l capacity experimental trials with aerobic imbr imbr trials were performed using the feed reactor tank t i of 5 l maximum capacity in which 2 l of effluent sample and 100 ml of mixed microbial consortia were added the dimensions of the 5 l reactor tank t i were 40 cm 13 cm 20 cm a 25 l capacity feed tank t i was similarly employed for processing 20 l of coffee effluent added with 1000 ml of mixed microbial consortia the dimensions of the 25 l reactor tank were noted to be 50 cm 13 cm 40 cm in both cases the reactor t i was connected to a side stream hf uf membrane module with the outlet flow line attached to a diaphragm pump for generating positive pressure on the membrane while the tank was kept under constant aeration in the case of 2 l batch a pressure of 4 kg cm 2 produced a permeate flow rate of 1 7 l h at ambient temperature 28 2 c on the other hand for 20 l batch a flow rate of 17 l h was attained at the same pressure and temperature in both cases the wastewater level in the bioreactor was maintained constant in order to keep the hydraulic retention time hrt at a value of 15 days permeate from t i was collected into an intermittent tank t ii for the ro process 1 7 l of permeate from the 2 l batch and 17 l of permeate from 20 l batch were recovered and stored in the respective intermittent tanks t ii for further processing by ro the respective permeates from t ii were subjected to ro at a pressure of 6 kg cm 2 and 1 25 l from 2 l and correspondingly 13 l from 20 l original feed batches were the final water quantities recovered the product water from the ro process was collected in a separate tank t iii both 2 l and 20 l experimental trials were performed for 15 days to allow microbial consortium sufficient time to degrade the cod samples collected from tanks t i t ii and t iii were analyzed to assess the efficiency of treatment the experiments were conducted in triplicate to reduce the error values from studies 2 2 4 membrane cleaning soon after the termination of the experiment on the basis of very low flux the membrane modules were subjected to cleaning with tap water at a pressure of 2 kg cm 2 chemical cleaning of the membrane was then performed by treating with 1 of citric acid for 15 min to remove mineral scales and metal precipitates followed by water wash for 10 min the membrane was further cleaned with a mixture of 1 sodium hydroxide naoh 0 5 ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid edta and 0 1 of sodium lauryl sulfate sls for 15 min to dislodge stubborn organic foulants followed by a water wash again for 10 min as a consequence of the above cleaning protocols the scales formed on the membrane were completely removed and 99 of the original flux was restored 17 20 during shut down the membrane was stored in 0 5 w v sodium metabisulfite smbs aqueous solution to prevent biological fouling in the present paper the same membrane and operating conditions were used for 2 l and 20 l capacity feeds 2 2 5 morphological analysis by sem the surface and cross sectional morphologies of hf uf 5 kda membrane were carried out using hitachi s2150 scanning electron microscope sem purchased from japan the membranes were cut into the desired size under liquid nitrogen conditions to obtain a smooth cross section the samples were coated with gold sputtering using a sputter coater and subjected to sem analysis at 10 kv potential the surface and cross sectional images were magnified to determine the characteristics of the pva blended pes on polyester non woven fabric support 2 2 6 analytical methods effluent from a local coffee industry was collected in a closed container and analyzed for different physicochemical parameters like ph tds turbidity electrical conductivity ec cod color and odor 21 the ph and ec of the samples were measured using ph model dcm 900 and conductivity model dph 504 meters purchased from global electronics hyderabad india respectively tds was determined using a hm digital meter mg l units supplied by svs water solutions hyderabad india turbidity and color of the samples were measured using a colorimeter of model dr 890 hach bengaluru india in units of formazin attenuation unit fau and color intensity in platinum cobalt pt co units respectively 2 2 7 calculation of flux retention and cod the membrane performance can be evaluated by calculating the flux retention and cod as follows the flux was calculated using the following equation 1 p e r m e a t e f l u x j v o l u m e o f p e r m e a t e v m e m b r a n e a r e a a x t i m e t where the units of the flux membrane

respectively the cod of the feed and permeate samples were calculated as follows 4 c o d m g l b s n 8000 d f v where b amount of ferrous ammonium sulfate fas consumed for blank sample s amount of fas consumed for sample n normality of fas 8000 equivalent weight of oxygen per liter v volume of a sample taken in ml d f dilution factor 3 results and discussion 3 1 scanning electron microscopy the surface and cross sectional sem morphologies of the hf uf 5 kda membrane are provided in fig 2 a and b fig 2 a indicates the presence of micropores of pva polymeric membrane uniformly distributed throughout the surface of the pes layer without any agglomerations which are clearly visible at 10 µm magnification of the image from fig 2 b the pva polymer effectively blended with ultraporous pes layer moreover the pva pes blend was found to interpenetrate through microvoids of the polyester nonwoven fabric support as evident at 200 µm magnification of the two layered structure therefore pva was successfully blended with pes as proven by both morphological views 22 3 2 effect of microbial consortia in effluent treatment the indigenous microbial consortia was found responsible for different biochemical reactions present to enable degradation of the organic matter from 20 000 to 40 mg l 99 in the coffee industrial wastewater to attain permissible limits under cpcb for discharge into the environment cod 250 mg l 4 color reduction was nearly 50 as recorded after an incubation period of 10 days under constant shaking condition the influence of bacterial consortia affected a change in ph from 7 0 to 9 0 at temperature 30 2 c fig 4 illustrates the removal of color with time there was no significant change in percentage removal of cod after 6 days after which a significant reduction was observed the cod removal was found to be nearly 40 while turbidity decreased by 36 after an incubation period of 15 days under continuous aeration and recirculation 3 3 integrated membrane bioreactor operation for 2 l and 20 l batches the results for imbr based processing of 2 l and 20 l batch sizes of coffee industrial effluent reveal a significant reduction in all parameters the detailed observations are provided in table 2 the acidic ph of 4 98 of the effluent was adjusted to neutral followed by the addition of microbial consortia isolated from the soil sample in the bioreactor there was no further change observed in ph value up to 5 days of exposure in the bioreactor interestingly after the fifth day there was a sudden increase in ph value from 8 to 8 89 in t ii after the mbr process and up to and 8 92 in t iii after ro treatment however after 15 days the ph value decreased to 8 86 in t ii and 8 60 in t iii cod value in the coffee industrial effluent was higher than that specified by the cpcb during the experiments with 2 l and 20 l batch sizes up to a period of 5 days there was no reduction in cod values a decline in cod value could be seen only on the sixth day due to the stabilization of the microbial consortia isolated from the soil sample the microbes in the bioreactor gradually acclimatized and consumed the substrate comprising of organics and other nutrients available in the effluent after 10 days of operating time the cod value decreased from 20 000 mg l to 18 000 for 2 l batch and to 17 000 mg l for 20 l batch in t ii of mbr treatment post ro treatment the cod further lowered to 3000 and 2650 mg l in t iii for the two different batch capacities a considerable decline in cod values was observed after the 15th day to values in the range of 12 000 and 13 000 mg l in t ii and finally as low as 40 and 60 mg l in t iii respectively the final cod values were thus observed to be 40 mg l for 2 l batch feed and 60 mg l for 20 l batch feed as seen in fig 3 b these values exhibit a great improvement over the data reported for treatment of coffee effluent by haddis and devi in 2008 23 where cod was reduced from 25 600 mg l to15 780 mg l for disposal into downstream water bodies other literature exhibited a reduction from 19 840 mg l to 11 200 mg l cod for 1 l batch of wastewater of coffee grounds using biochar as adsorbent 24 according to asha and kumar 2015 25 a study for coffee industrial wastewater with 1 l batch of coffee arabica using aluminum electrodes in an electrochemical process revealed a cod reduction from 12 840 to 618 mg l the results shown in table 2 indicate that tds and turbidity reduction were observed after 5 days of treatment in the bioreactor from the sixth day onwards the reduction can be seen in the bioreactor due to the activity of the microbial consortia on the effluent after 10 days the reduction in tds and turbidity values for 2 l and 20 l batches subjected to imbr process were observed as 1250 and 1325 mg l of tds 850 and 900 fau of turbidity correspondingly in t ii of mbr which got further reduced to 576 and 550 mg l 530 and 550 fau respectively in t iii after ro an additional 5 days of extra exposure to constitute a total duration of 15 days resulted in further reduction of tds to 1050 and 1150 mg l and turbidity to 720 and 700 fau in t ii with the imbr process at 2 l and 20 l batch sizes respectively as shown in fig 3 a tds was furthermore reduced to 357 and 360 mg l with nil turbidity after passing through the ro membrane the presence of a high level of tds was due to organic and inorganic matter present in the effluent after the treatment process a low level of tds was recorded in cases of both 2 l and 20 l batches with attainment of acceptable limits a similar reduction in tds from 2538 to 1258 mg l was reported by venkata swamy and co authors in 2016 26 using nanofiltration nf membrane for treatment of 30 l biscuit industrial effluent our study claims a substantial reduction in cod from 20 000 mg l to 40 mg l for 2 l batch and 60 mg l for 20 l batch size besides a final value of zero turbidity using the imbr process in treating coffee wastewater it is worth mentioning that the imbr process is safe and effective compared to earlier studies and provides an acceptable range of parameters set by the cpcb with 71 recovery of quality water for reuse the technology possesses a triple action process i e biological reaction linked with dual membrane technique thus the study suggests that the imbr process can be considered as an advanced way to deal with complicated effluents the ro permeate can be recycled back to the plant for reuse in various utilities like washing cleaning or even plantation etc the ro reject is highly concentrated in all pollutants therefore in case 1 the reject water could be subjected to anaerobic digestion in the form of a slurry after addition of microbial consortia whereas in case 2 the obtained sludge from mbr would be fed to an anaerobic gas chamber to generate biogas as a byproduct for cooking purposes fig 1 a the retentate i e remaining sludge is collected and sent to a solid waste management plant for biogas generation with high methane content 27 the scale up ratio from 2 l to 20 l effluent batch showed consistent performance with pollutant reduction being gradual for 10 days of treatment but accelerating after 15 days with a drastic reduction in all parameters that displays the effectiveness of the imbr technology in meeting the norms of environmental safety 3 4 effect of operating time on volumetric flux membrane performance was evaluated by calculating the volumetric flux against operating time during the treatment of 2 l and 20 l feed effluent batches by hf uf tank ii and ro tank iii membranes in cycle 1 of 10 days duration and cycle 2 of 15 days time period in cycle 1 shown in fig 4 a when hf uf membrane was subjected to a pressure of 4 kg cm 2 the volumetric flux decreased from 73 51 l m2 h to 40 84 l m2 h across an operating time of 0 54 8 33 min for 2 l batch while it reduced from 86 58 l m2 h to 39 16 l m2 h over a time period of 0 58 21 71 min for 20 l batch size from fig 4 b for ro the flux is seen to lower from 100 to 74 41 l m2 h for 2 l batch and from 93 75 to 67 01 l m2 h for 20 l batch across corresponding operating times of 0 2 4 40 min and 0 53 9 75 min at an operating pressure of 6 kg cm 2 further after cleaning of membranes in cycle 2 15 days the hf uf membrane flux was found to decline from 62 32 to 40 23 l m2 h within 8 45 min for 2 l batch and from 81 21 to 39 04 l m2 h in 21 71 min for 20 l batch respectively as seen in fig 4 c on the other hand flux of the effluent through ro membrane reduced from 92 95 to 56 35 l m2 h for 2 l batch in 9 85 min and from 99 5 to 72 35 l m2 h in 4 95 min for 20 l batch respectively as seen in fig 4 d the retention in cycle 1 was observed to be 17 8 and 12 8 in case of hf uf membrane and 62 1 and 63 8 for ro for 2 l and 20 l batches respectively on the other hand in case of cycle 2 the retention was 30 9 for 2 l batch and 24 3 for 20 l batch for hf uf membrane while corresponding values for ro were observed to be 76 5 and 76 3 respectively post membrane cleaning the declination in both flux and retention for 2 l and 20 l batch processes in cycles 1 and 2 could be considered negligible as the scales on the membrane surface were efficiently dislodged by the reagents used in the washing solutions thus the volumetric flux declination study exhibits that the hf uf and ro membranes have been conjectured to possess lower fouling propensity the membranes could be washed thoroughly with acidic citric acid and alkaline edta naoh solutions after each batch experiment the washing protocols followed in this study comprehensively removed inorganic and organic foulants from the membrane surface to enhance performance and lifespan of both ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis membranes 3 5 effect of membrane cleaning cycle on pure water flux membrane performance depends upon the number of cleaning cycles which affects the pure water flux after chemical washing of the hf uf and ro membanes after each cycle of effluent treatment the pure water flux was recorded to understand cleaning efficiency fig 5 a for 2 l batch size reveals the pure water flux of hf uf membrane to decrease from 114 89 l m2 h to 108 64 l m2 h in cycle 1 and to a value of 102 12 l m2 h in cycle 2 in case of ro the original pure water flux of 89 12 l m2 h reduced to 85 65 l m2 h in cycle 1 and in case of cycle 2 it lowered to 82 05 l m2 h similarly fig 5 b representing 20 l batch experiments depicts the original pure water flux of hf uf and ro membranes to be 135 82 l m2 h and 110 13 l m2 h respectively the values after membrane cleaning in cycles 1 and 2 reduced to 120 16 l m2 h and 116 68 l m2 h for hf uf membrane while those corresponding to ro membrane lowered to 106 12 l m2 h in cycle 1 and 102 65 l m2 h in cycle 2 fig 6 3 6 removal of color and odor separation of color and odor from effluents is critical and essential for enhancement of quality of the treated water earlier studies performed on the removal of color from industrial effluents using membranes 28 29 or activated carbon adsorbent by hang and woodams in 1979 30 report low reduction the hf uf and ro membranes were found to be highly effective for color removal from coffee wastewater in the present work the novel imbr process reports 100 removal in color from dark brown to colorless and odor from strong pungent to an acceptable range there was only a slight change in color after 10 days of operation whereas transparent water with acceptable odor was observed after 15 days of imbr which involved post treatment by ro the visual change in color obtained in this study is shown in fig 5 after imbr experiments were completed in 15 days chemical cleaning of the membrane was done to restore the flux by removal of foulants observations made from this cleaning protocol of this process support a similar study by hong and elimelech in 1997 31 the cleaning protocol adopted in the present study has helped in using the membrane for multiple cycles of operation with an enhanced life span though wastewater treatment is a challenging task in this era of zero liquid discharge zld the present study proves that the imbr process is technically feasible and economically viable in meeting the permissible limits established by cpcb for reuse or discharge of treated effluent into water bodies 3 7 economics of integrated membrane bioreactor process the activated sludge process asp requires huge space high energy and more manpower when comparing to the membrane processes which is a one time investment to obtain good quality of water for reuse in various applications to reduce fresh water consumption to determine economic feasibility a cost analysis was carried out and a statement of expenditure was prepared for 1000 l h capacity pilot plant as projected in table 2 cost analysis for the present study accounts for a complete list of expenses incurred during the execution of the experiments venkata swamy et al 2016 25 made a cost analysis for processing 1000 l h of biscuit industrial effluent by nf membrane and reported a capital investment of 4387 usd inr 2 80 lacs sarker and sarkar 2018 32 implemented cost analysis for chemical and paint manufacturing industrial effluents the etp plant cost component of the chemical facility was 16 667 and for paint facility about 39 103 in the current work the capital investment for a 1000 l h capacity has been projected to be 9512 usd inr 6 5 lacs a detailed spreadsheet of this estimate along with the operation and maintenance costs are presented in tables 3 and 4 respectively the water recovery was considered as 71 after the imbr process for 20 h of operating time of mbr and 15 h of ro per day the duration of membrane module replacement was considered to be 3 years cleaning in place cip is an important factor for ensuring long membrane life in all etps the cost of membrane cleaning could add up to 20 30 of total operational costs 33 3 8 comparison of present work with literature results observed during the present work with respect to various parameters such as cod tds color and turbidity are compared with existing data in the literature table 5 depicts the treatment of coffee effluent using imbr to have effectively removed 99 cod 100 color and turbidity and 76 tds compared to other conventional methods stand alone membrane and other integrated membrane processes therefore the current process is technically feasible economically viable environmentally clean with inherent safety in operating protocols 34 4 conclusions the performance of an integrated membrane bioreactor process using aerobic reactor manned with a side stream high flux ultrafiltration membrane followed by reverse osmosis as a post treatment has shown optimum performance for the treatment of coffee industrial effluent the configuration is highly feasible for upscaling due to the easy availability of aerobic reactors of robust design as well as advanced versions of ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis membranes the imbr process acquires the 3 es quality of being easy effective and economical and presents itself as a superior technique for removal of 100 of the turbidity color and odor present in coffee effluent accompanied by 99 reduction in chemical oxygen demand and 76 of total dissolved solids imbr appears to be an excellent tool for extending its implementation in the treatment ofother challenging industrial effluents like textiles distillery and tanneries the recovered water obtained from imbr configuration meets the acceptable range of 250 mg l cod and 5 5 9 0 ph specified by the central pollution control board government of india as per the norms the coffee processing industry falls under the orange category of schedule i industries and the reclaimed water can be used in various applications such as industrial utilities domestic purpose gardening and ground water recharge membrane cleaning protocols involving acidic and alkaline washing ensured efficient control of fouling with nearly complete restoration of original pure water flux effluent flux and retention values the reject contains a minimum quantity of slurry that could be subjected to anaerobic digestion to facilitate biogas production with solid sludge landfill for disposal to ensure a safe

13883,a large amount of steel slag has not been effectively used seriously polluting the environment based on the idea of waste control steel slag was applied to the preparation of particle electrode for the first time and sn mn loaded steel slag zeolite particle electrode was prepared and used in a three dimensional electrocatalytic system tde for rhodamine b rhb degradation the particle electrode was also characterized by x ray fluorescence spectrum xrf scanning electron microscope sem and x ray diffraction xrd the results showed that 1 sn mn loaded steel slag zeolite particle electrode was manufactured with the sn mn ratio 2 1 2 the physical and chemical characterization of sn mn loaded steel slag zeolite particle electrode confirmed that it was a good particle electrode for the degradation of organics 3 when the starting concentration of rhb is 10 mg l the degradation rate of rhb in the tde reached 95 0 at the optimal sintering conditions such as the current 0 5 a electrolyte 0 125 mol l and anode below the findings suggest that sn mn loaded steel slag zeolite particle is a cheap and efficient method for degradation of dye wastewater at the same time it also shows that steel slag has great application potential in tde system which provides a new way to utilize solid waste to treat refractory organics keywords particle electrode steel slag three dimensional electrocatalytic system rhodamine b 1 introduction steel slag is an oxidizing material produced in the production of crude steel in basic oxygen furnace by adding lime dolomite and other auxiliary materials to pig iron in blast furnace blowing oxygen to pig iron and removing carbon phosphorus and sulfur in the iron 1 steel slag is an industrial by product of steel production 2 china has accumulated more than 400 million tons of steel slag with an annual cumulative volume of 100 million tons alkaline leachate in steel slag not only occupies land but also may pollute soil and water 3 massive steel slag emissions are causing environmental problems in china the concept of using waste to treat waste has received wide attention in the field of water treatment 4 for its sorptive characteristics slag has been used in water and wastewater treatments as a low cost adsorbent replacing granular activated carbon and is widely used in the environmental field 5 6 adsorptions of dye 7 arsenic 8 and lead 9 are the examples however no one has yet applied steel slag to the preparation of particle electrodes steel slag contains a variety of metal oxides and non metallic oxides such as cao fe2o3 al2o3 sio2 10 the particle electrode supports transition metal oxides and metal oxides that are important in the formation of strong oxidants in tde such as hydroxyl radicals and h2o2 11 12 thus the effect of particle electrode on pollutants removal can be improved therefore the application of steel slag in the preparation of particle electrode cannot only solve the use of steel slag by waste treatment but also improve the removal efficiency of particle electrode the materials used to prepare granular electrodes are activated charcoal particles 13 ceramic filtering material 14 zeolite 15 zeolite is a crystalline aluminum silicate with complex molecular structure 16 the main part are composed of three dimensional silica oxygen and aluminum oxygen skeleton 17 the exemplary surface area and the cation exchange capacity make it a suitable platform for adsorption of different species such as molecules anions and metal nanoparticles 18 moreover the larger surface area and the pore structure of zeolite enable to absorb the electrolyte and electrochemical reaction species which can lead to a suitable condition for electrochemical measurement during diffusion controlled mass transfer process 19 20 however the poor conductivity of zeolite can lead to the high energy consumption which will hinder the application of the electrochemical system 21 zeolite has a certain adhesion 22 23 so steel slag and zeolite mixed together can prepare the particle electrode with stable performance good conductive effect strong adsorption capacity and high mass transfer efficiency sno2 and mno2 have good electrical conductivity 24 particle electrode usually adds them as active substances to enhance its electrical conductivity and stability in this study sn mn loaded steel slag zeolite particle electrode is prepared for the degradation of rhodamine b rhb the effect of active components and sn mn mass ratio on the electrocatalytic oxidation capacity of sn mn loaded steel slag zeolite particle electrode was investigated the physical and chemical characterization of sn mn loaded steel slag zeolite particle electrode were analyzed by xrf sem and xrd in addition this study also analyzed the factors which affect rhb degradation in the electrolytic cell with sn mn loaded steel slag zeolite particle electrode there are two novel aspects to the present work firstly it applied steel slag to the preparation of particle electrode for the first time secondly it mixed low cost materials such as steel slag and zeolite to produce more efficient and stable particle electrodes the fundamental knowledge and experience gained in this study can be used to advance the new wastewater treatment process and further the water treatment industry 2 materials and methods 2

were obtained from shenzhen titanium industry co ltd china the stainless steel plates as the anode were obtained from baosteel steel co ltd the plexiglass for assembling the reactor was provided by shenzhen yak plexiglass products co ltd mno2 sno2 fe3o4 and na2so4 were all analytical grade and in powder form which were provided by fuchen chemical reagent co ltd 2 2 reactor description as can be seen from fig 1 the shape of the electrolytic cell is cylindrical with an outer diameter of 11 cm an inner diameter of 10 cm and a height of 20 cm it is made of pmma plexiglass material the anode is made of stainless steel mesh and is located under the electrolytic cell its diameter is 10 cm and the aperture of the net is 3 mm the cathode is made of titanium mesh and is located above the electrolytic cell its diameter is 10 cm and the aperture of the net is 3 mm the bottom of the reactor is equipped with evenly distributed aeration device 2 3 preparation of sn mn loaded steel slag zeolite particle electrode the flow chart of sn mn loaded steel slag zeolite particle electrode preparation is shown in fig 2 first of all the steel slag and zeolite slag were dried at 120 for 4 h the dried steel slag and zeolite were ground into powder by the ball mill then the powder was screened with 80 mesh secondly mixed the steel slag powder zeolite powder and active components in a muller at a mass ratio of 5 4 1 and stirred well pore forming agent starch was also added with 12 these raw materials were mixed well and rolled into balls with 3 5 mm in diameter thirdly the semi manufactured sn mn loaded steel slag zeolite particle electrode were sintered in a muffle furnace gzx 940mbe shanghai at 1190 c for 15 min finally the sintered products were gradually cooled down to room temperature the sn mn loaded steel slag zeolite particle electrode was obtained as shown in fig 3 2 4 analytical methods and calculations the conductivity and the ph were tested by conductivity meter fe30 mettler toledo and ph meter fe20 mettler toledo respectively x ray fluorescence spectra xrf s8 tiger germany axs were used to study the main chemical components of sn mn loaded steel slag zeolite particle electrode the crystal structure in the sn mn loaded steel slag zeolite particle electrode was analyzed by x ray diffraction xrd d8advance u s the morphology of sn mn loaded steel slag zeolite particle electrode was characterized by scanning electron microscope sem supratm55 germany zeiss the absorbance of rhb solution at 554 nm was analyzed by using a type 721 double beam ultraviolet spectrophotometer the removal efficiency η was calculated according to eq 1 where c0 is the initial concentration and ct is the concentration at time t d 1 η c 0 c t c 0 100 2 5 rhb degradation experiment in order to study the optimal degradation conditions of rhb by sn mn loaded steel slag zeolite particle electrode the single factor experiment change only one of the key factors and the rest remain the same was conducted when the initial ph and rhb concentration of the solution was 5 86 and 10 mg l respectively the current intensity electrolyte concentration and electrode plate s position the anode was underneath or the anode was above of the experiment were taken as the key factors to study the degradation efficiency of rhb in the electrolytic cell with sn mn loaded steel slag zeolite particle electrode firstly the current intensity was set as 0 0125 a 0 250 a and 0 500 a respectively secondly sodium sulfate used as electrolyte with the concentration 0 05 mol l 0 10 mol l and 0 20 mol l to explore the effect of electrolyte concentration on rhb removal at last the anode and cathode of the electrode plate was interchanged to study the position effect of the anode and cathode on the degradation of rhb 3 results and discussion 3 1 preparation of sn mn loaded steel slag zeolite particle electrode in the experimental conditions of rhb solution concentration of 10 mg l and electrolyte na2so4 concentration of 0 1 mol l a current of 0 5 a was introduced to conduct the experiment the removal rates of rhb by two dimensional electrocatalysis and three dimensional electrocatalysis were compared as shown in fig 4 a under the same electrochemical conditions the degradation efficiency of three dimensional electrocatalysis on rhb was 81 at 180 min which was significantly higher than that of two dimensional electrocatalysis 70 the addition of particle electrodes in the three dimensional electrocatalytic reactor are equivalent to the addition of many tiny batteries which increase the mass transfer efficiency of the reaction reduce the mass transfer distance and at the same time increase the specific surface area of the reaction thus improve the degradation efficiency of rhb the ratio of active components and mass of particle electrode have significant effects on the electrocatalytic efficiency of three dimensional electrocatalytic system 25 3 1 1 effect of active components on rhb removal rate fig 4a shows the effects of electrocatalytic degradation of rhb by particle electrodes at different active components it can be seen from fig 4a that under the same experimental conditions in the three dimensional electrocatalytic system the degradation efficiency of the particle electrode without load was 81 which was significantly lower than that of the three dimensional particle electrode system with loaded active components 86 for fe sn and 94 for sn mn apparently the addition of metal active components significantly promoted the catalytic activity of particle electrode and the synergistic effect between different metal oxides such as mno2 sno2 and fe3o4 also promoted the catalytic degradation of rhb to different degrees obviously the catalytic effect of the active components of sn mn was better than that of fe sn according to yuan et al 2018 the catalytic performance of modified zeolite after adding sn significantly improved in degradation of dihydroxyacetone 26 in the experimental study of rhb removal manganese modified steel slag particle electrode can significantly improve the catalytic performance of steel slag particle electrode 27 and in the degradation experiment of toluene the catalytic activity of catalyst was significantly increased after mn was added in the catalyst 28 therefore the addition of sn and mn can improve the catalytic activity of the particle electrode 26 the catalytic activity of the particle electrode added with sno2 and mno2 was significantly improved which could generate more stronger oxidants like hydroxyl radicals to react with the dye molecules and degrade them into organic intermediates of small molecules until they were decomposed into co2 and h2o so sno2 and mno2 were selected as active components of particle electrode to prepare particle electrode with high catalytic activity 3 1 2 effect of sn mn mass ratio on rhb removal rate fig 4b showed that the three dimensional electriccatalytic systems for rhb degradation efficiency have improved on the increase in the mass ratio of manganese to tin rhb degradation rate enhanced from 81 to 84 when the sn mn ratio increased from 1 2 to 1 1 it was important to highlight that rhb degradation rate reached 94 when the sn mn ratio reached 2 1 with the best degradation effect for rhb in the electrocatalytic degradation process the particles loaded with sno2 had high electrocatalytic activity 25 which could improve the degradation efficiency of rhb moreover a certain amount of mno2 could cooperate with sno2 to improve the catalytic activity of the particle electrode 29 the lattice constants of sno2 and mno2 were similar the two were doped to form a semiconductor solid solution it increased the active site and electron hole of particle electrode provided a large space for lattice oxygen and improved the activity and transport capacity of lattice oxygen in the catalyst it was beneficial for the conversion of o2 to o2 o and ho2 at the particle electrode the exist of a variety of active materials oh o2 o and ho2 accelerated the degradation of rhb electrocatalytic reaction was mainly the reaction of free radicals when the content of mn in particle electrode is too high the negative catalytic reaction of inhibiting free radicals will occur so the sn mn mass ratio is 2 1 in subsequent tests 3 2 physical and chemical characterization of sn mn loaded steel slag zeolite particle electrode 3 2 1 xrf characterization x ray fluorescence spectra xrf of the two particle electrode were scanned and the results were shown in table 1 table 1 showed that the main chemical components of the particle electrode were sio2 fe2o3 cao and al2o3 the reason was that the materials that made up the particle electrode were mainly steel slag and zeolite the steel slag was mainly the oxides of fe and ca and zeolite was mainly the oxides of si and al it was found that the percentage of mno2 4 31 and sno2 2 09 of the loaded particle electrode was significantly higher than that of the unloaded particle electrode and mn sn was about 2 1 this proved that the particle electrode was very successful in loading mn and sn in addition the particle electrode also had other oxides such as na2o tio2 v2o5 so3 cr2o3 sro zno zro2 cuo mgo transition metal oxides e g fe2o3 mno2 v2o5 cr2o3 zno zro2 cuo had an excellent catalytic effect on the degradation of organic compounds 14 according to zhang et al 2019 the degradation effect of rhb on the fe cu kaolin electrode was significantly higher than that on the kaolin electrode 13 so sn mn loaded steel slag zeolite particle electrode was a good choice to degraded organic compounds 3 2 2 sem characterization the particle electrode without load and loaded with sn mn was observed by sem and the results were shown in fig 5 the diameter of the particle electrode was about 5 3 mm and its surface was rough and porous the pore formation of particle electrode was mainly caused by the pore forming agent added in the preparation of particle electrode this porous structure increased the specific surface area of the particle electrode enhanced the mass transfer of the material and also added more active sites so that the particle electrode can adsorb and degrade rhb better 3 2 3 xrd characterization in order to further understand the metal morphology of sn mn loaded steel slag zeolite particle electrode x ray diffraction analysis was performed on the powders of the two particle electrode after grinding the diffraction pattern obtained was shown in fig 6 by comparing with the figures a and b in fig 6 it can be found that the active components mn and sn in the particle electrode mainly exist in the form of mno2 crystal and sno2 crystal moreover it was not difficult to find from the figure that the area of the diffraction peaks of mno2 and sno2 in the charged sn mn particle electrode was larger than that of the unloaded active component in other words the mno2 crystal and sno2 crystal content in the particle electrode loaded with sn mn was higher than that in the particle electrode not loaded with the active component these results demonstrated that the preparation of sn mn particle electrode was very successful 3 3 the influence of key factors on rhb degradation in order to determine the optimal process conditions for degradation of rhb the main factors affecting the degradation of rhb were also studied in the electrolytic cell with sn mn loaded steel slag zeolite particle electrode such as current intensity initial electrolyte dosage electrode positive and negative pole exchange the results were shown in fig 7 3 3 1 the effect of current intensity on rhb degradation when the electrolyte concentration was 0 10 mol l the initial ph value was 5 86 and the initial concentration of rhb was 10 mg l the current intensity was adjusted to 0 125 a 0 250 a and 0 500 a respectively for the experiment as shown in fig 7a with the current intensity increasing the degradation efficiency of rhb by particle electrode respectively reached 70 48 78 80 95 10 it can also be seen from the fig 7a that there were significant differences in the degradation efficiency of rhb by particle electrode under three current intensities the reasons were as follows i oh was formed on the surface of the anode and h2o2 was generated at the cathode which increases with the increase of current intensity 13 30 ii with the increase of current intensity the reactor can polarize more particle electrodes thereby enhancing the redox process and electrical adsorption capacity of the particle electrode surface and promoting the heterogeneous catalysis of the particle electrode surface 31 in addition the larger the number of microelectrodes the wider the reaction area and the stronger the free radicals produced 32 therefore 0 500 a was selected as the optimal current intensity in this experiment 3 3 2 the effect of initial electrolyte dosage on rhb degradation when the intensity of electric current initial ph value and initial concentration of rhb was 0 5 a 5 86 and 10 mg l respectively the initial electrolyte dosage was adjusted to 0 05 mol l 0 10 mol l and 0 20 mol l respectively fig 7b showed that the degradation rate of rhb reached 90 45 89 97 and 89 50 in 180 min respectively it could be found that electrolyte concentration had little effect on the performance of electrocatalytic system the variation trend of the three curves was basically the same due to the reaction mechanism of rhb degradation process was similar which was all degraded after adsorption direct oxidation and indirect oxidation 27 at 60 min the removal rate of low electrolyte concentration was better than the reaction curve of high electrolyte concentration the reason was that the input current and the reactor resistance were constant during the experiment when the electrolyte concentration decreased the voltage at both ends of the reactor increased as a result the electric energy inputs into the reactor increased which made the direct oxidation indirect oxidation electroflocculation and electroadsorption in the reactor more intense therefore 0 05 mol l was selected as the optimal initial electrolyte dosage 3 3 3 the effect of electrode plate s position on rhb degradation under the experimental condition that the current intensity the electrolyte concentration the initial ph value and the initial concentration of rhb was 0 5 a 0 10 mol l 5 86 and 10 mg l we exchanged the reactor s anode and cathode to explore the effect of electrode exchange on rhb degradation as shown in fig 7c under the two conditions there was significant difference in the effect of particle electrode on the degradation of rhb the degradation efficiency of rhb was about 92 33 when the anode was underneath the cathode was above in electrocatalytic system the rhb degradation efficiency of the electrocatalytic system was about 42 03 when the anode was above the cathode was underneath when the particle electrode was in contact with the anode it was polarized by the anode and became a small electrode with a positive charge rhb on the one hand was negatively charged when it was electrolyzed in solution thus a large amount of rhb will be electrically adsorbed and attached to the surface of the particle electrode and removed from the solution on the other hand rhb was a large molecule with a large number of benzene rings which was chemically stable the anode had a high oxidation potential which can destroy the stability of the ring structure so as to realize the degradation of rhb 33 conversely when the cathode was directly below the filled particle electrode was polarized and negatively charged while the rhb itself was negatively charged so the two substances repelled each other the adsorption and degradation effects of rhb are greatly reduced moreover under the condition that the cathode was directly below the particle electrode had a high negative potential and could not destroy the benzene ring structure in rhb 34 as a result rhb degraded relatively better when the anode was directly below it 3 4 uv spectrum scanning in order to explore the change rule of the removal effect of rhb with time the solution with processing time of 0 min 60 min 120 min and 180 min were analyzed by dual beam ultraviolet spectrophotometer fig 8 shows that rhb had the largest ultraviolet absorption peak at 554 nm and its absorption peak strength reduced with the increase of reaction time it is suggested that the concentration of rhb decreased over time after 60 min of illumination the adsorption peak of rhb gradually disappeared by the blue shift 35 this phenomenon indicated that rhb was gradually degraded and in the meanwhile new substances were formed 36 4 conclusions sn mn loaded steel slag zeolite particle electrode was prepared from waste steel slag and zeolite the sn mn loaded steel slag zeolite particle electrode was characterized by sem fluorescence spectrum and xrd when the loading active components were mno2 and sno2 and the mass ratio was 2 1 the catalytic activity of the particles was the highest and more free radicals were generated to degrade rhb the study found that the main factor affecting the removal effect of rhb was the current intensity as the current increased the oxidation capacity of the anode increased more particle electrodes were polarized and more free radicals were produced when the current was 0 500 a the removal rate of rhb was the highest reaching 95 10 electrolyte concentration had little effect on the efficiency of electrocatalytic system during the experiment exchanged the anode and cathode poles of the reactor when the anode was underneath the oxidation potential of the anode was high which could destroy the stability of rhb at this time the degradation effect of rhb was better with a degradation rate of 92 33 in conclusion the tde with sn mn loaded steel slag zeolite particle electrode could degrade rhb effectively which was an efficient and reliable treatment method in the process of

13883,a large amount of steel slag has not been effectively used seriously polluting the environment based on the idea of waste control steel slag was applied to the preparation of particle electrode for the first time and sn mn loaded steel slag zeolite particle electrode was prepared and used in a three dimensional electrocatalytic system tde for rhodamine b rhb degradation the particle electrode was also characterized by x ray fluorescence spectrum xrf scanning electron microscope sem and x ray diffraction xrd the results showed that 1 sn mn loaded steel slag zeolite particle electrode was manufactured with the sn mn ratio 2 1 2 the physical and chemical characterization of sn mn loaded steel slag zeolite particle electrode confirmed that it was a good particle electrode for the degradation of organics 3 when the starting concentration of rhb is 10 mg l the degradation rate of rhb in the tde reached 95 0 at the optimal sintering conditions such as the current 0 5 a electrolyte 0 125 mol l and anode below the findings suggest that sn mn loaded steel slag zeolite particle is a cheap and efficient method for degradation of dye wastewater at the same time it also shows that steel slag has great application potential in tde system which provides a new way to utilize solid waste to treat refractory organics keywords particle electrode steel slag three dimensional electrocatalytic system rhodamine b 1 introduction steel slag is an oxidizing material produced in the production of crude steel in basic oxygen furnace by adding lime dolomite and other auxiliary materials to pig iron in blast furnace blowing oxygen to pig iron and removing carbon phosphorus and sulfur in the iron 1 steel slag is an industrial by product of steel production 2 china has accumulated more than 400 million tons of steel slag with an annual cumulative volume of 100 million tons alkaline leachate in steel slag not only occupies land but also may pollute soil and water 3 massive steel slag emissions are causing environmental problems in china the concept of using waste to treat waste has received wide attention in the field of water treatment 4 for its sorptive characteristics slag has been used in water and wastewater treatments as a low cost adsorbent replacing granular activated carbon and is widely used in the environmental field 5 6 adsorptions of dye 7 arsenic 8 and lead 9 are the examples however no one has yet applied steel slag to the preparation of particle electrodes steel slag contains a variety of metal oxides and non metallic oxides such as cao fe2o3 al2o3 sio2 10 the particle electrode supports transition metal oxides and metal oxides that are important in the formation of strong oxidants in tde such as hydroxyl radicals and h2o2 11 12 thus the effect of particle electrode on pollutants removal can be improved therefore the application of steel slag in the preparation of particle electrode cannot only solve the use of steel slag by waste treatment but also improve the removal efficiency of particle electrode the materials used to prepare granular electrodes are activated charcoal particles 13 ceramic filtering material 14 zeolite 15 zeolite is a crystalline aluminum silicate with complex molecular structure 16 the main part are composed of three dimensional silica oxygen and aluminum oxygen skeleton 17 the exemplary surface area and the cation exchange capacity make it a suitable platform for adsorption of different species such as molecules anions and metal nanoparticles 18 moreover the larger surface area and the pore structure of zeolite enable to absorb the electrolyte and electrochemical reaction species which can lead to a suitable condition for electrochemical measurement during diffusion controlled mass transfer process 19 20 however the poor conductivity of zeolite can lead to the high energy consumption which will hinder the application of the electrochemical system 21 zeolite has a certain adhesion 22 23 so steel slag and zeolite mixed together can prepare the particle electrode with stable performance good conductive effect strong adsorption capacity and high mass transfer efficiency sno2 and mno2 have good electrical conductivity 24 particle electrode usually adds them as active substances to enhance its electrical conductivity and stability in this study sn mn loaded steel slag zeolite particle electrode is prepared for the degradation of rhodamine b rhb the effect of active components and sn mn mass ratio on the electrocatalytic oxidation capacity of sn mn loaded steel slag zeolite particle electrode was investigated the physical and chemical characterization of sn mn loaded steel slag zeolite particle electrode were analyzed by xrf sem and xrd in addition this study also analyzed the factors which affect rhb degradation in the electrolytic cell with sn mn loaded steel slag zeolite particle electrode there are two novel aspects to the present work firstly it applied steel slag to the preparation of particle electrode for the first time secondly it mixed low cost materials such as steel slag and zeolite to produce more efficient and stable particle electrodes the fundamental knowledge and experience gained in this study can be used to advance the new wastewater treatment process and further the water treatment industry 2 materials and methods 2

seen from fig 1 the shape of the electrolytic cell is cylindrical with an outer diameter of 11 cm an inner diameter of 10 cm and a height of 20 cm it is made of pmma plexiglass material the anode is made of stainless steel mesh and is located under the electrolytic cell its diameter is 10 cm and the aperture of the net is 3 mm the cathode is made of titanium mesh and is located above the electrolytic cell its diameter is 10 cm and the aperture of the net is 3 mm the bottom of the reactor is equipped with evenly distributed aeration device 2 3 preparation of sn mn loaded steel slag zeolite particle electrode the flow chart of sn mn loaded steel slag zeolite particle electrode preparation is shown in fig 2 first of all the steel slag and zeolite slag were dried at 120 for 4 h the dried steel slag and zeolite were ground into powder by the ball mill then the powder was screened with 80 mesh secondly mixed the steel slag powder zeolite powder and active components in a muller at a mass ratio of 5 4 1 and stirred well pore forming agent starch was also added with 12 these raw materials were mixed well and rolled into balls with 3 5 mm in diameter thirdly the semi manufactured sn mn loaded steel slag zeolite particle electrode were sintered in a muffle furnace gzx 940mbe shanghai at 1190 c for 15 min finally the sintered products were gradually cooled down to room temperature the sn mn loaded steel slag zeolite particle electrode was obtained as shown in fig 3 2 4 analytical methods and calculations the conductivity and the ph were tested by conductivity meter fe30 mettler toledo and ph meter fe20 mettler toledo respectively x ray fluorescence spectra xrf s8 tiger germany axs were used to study the main chemical components of sn mn loaded steel slag zeolite particle electrode the crystal structure in the sn mn loaded steel slag zeolite particle electrode was analyzed by x ray diffraction xrd d8advance u s the morphology of sn mn loaded steel slag zeolite particle electrode was characterized by scanning electron microscope sem supratm55 germany zeiss the absorbance of rhb solution at 554 nm was analyzed by using a type 721 double beam ultraviolet spectrophotometer the removal efficiency η was calculated according to eq 1 where c0 is the initial concentration and ct is the concentration at time t d 1 η c 0 c t c 0 100 2 5 rhb degradation experiment in order to study the optimal degradation conditions of rhb by sn mn loaded steel slag zeolite particle electrode the single factor experiment change only one of the key factors and the rest remain the same was conducted when the initial ph and rhb concentration of the solution was 5 86 and 10 mg l respectively the current intensity electrolyte concentration and electrode plate s position the anode was underneath or the anode was above of the experiment were taken as the key factors to study the degradation efficiency of rhb in the electrolytic cell with sn mn loaded steel slag zeolite particle electrode firstly the current intensity was set as 0 0125 a 0 250 a and 0 500 a respectively secondly sodium sulfate used as electrolyte with the concentration 0 05 mol l 0 10 mol l and 0 20 mol l to explore the effect of electrolyte concentration on rhb removal at last the anode and cathode of the electrode plate was interchanged to study the position effect of the anode and cathode on the degradation of rhb 3 results and discussion 3 1 preparation of sn mn loaded steel slag zeolite particle electrode in the experimental conditions of rhb solution concentration of 10 mg l and electrolyte na2so4 concentration of 0 1 mol l a current of 0 5 a was introduced to conduct the experiment the removal rates of rhb by two dimensional electrocatalysis and three dimensional electrocatalysis were compared as shown in fig 4 a under the same electrochemical conditions the degradation efficiency of three dimensional electrocatalysis on rhb was 81 at 180 min which was significantly higher than that of two dimensional electrocatalysis 70 the addition of particle electrodes in the three dimensional electrocatalytic reactor are equivalent to the addition of many tiny batteries which increase the mass transfer efficiency of the reaction reduce the mass transfer distance and at the same time increase the specific surface area of the reaction thus improve the degradation efficiency of rhb the ratio of active components and mass of particle electrode have significant effects on the electrocatalytic efficiency of three dimensional electrocatalytic system 25 3 1 1 effect of active components on rhb removal rate fig 4a shows the effects of electrocatalytic degradation of rhb by particle electrodes at different active components it can be seen from fig 4a that under the same experimental conditions in the three dimensional electrocatalytic system the degradation efficiency of the particle electrode without load was 81 which was significantly lower than that of the three dimensional particle electrode system with loaded active components 86 for fe sn and 94 for sn mn apparently the addition of metal active components significantly promoted the catalytic activity of particle electrode and the synergistic effect between different metal oxides such as mno2 sno2 and fe3o4 also promoted the catalytic degradation of rhb to different degrees obviously the catalytic effect of the active components of sn mn was better than that of fe sn according to yuan et al 2018 the catalytic performance of modified zeolite after adding sn significantly improved in degradation of dihydroxyacetone 26 in the experimental study of rhb removal manganese modified steel slag particle electrode can significantly improve the catalytic performance of steel slag particle electrode 27 and in the degradation experiment of toluene the catalytic activity of catalyst was significantly increased after mn was added in the catalyst 28 therefore the addition of sn and mn can improve the catalytic activity of the particle electrode 26 the catalytic activity of the particle electrode added with sno2 and mno2 was significantly improved which could generate more stronger oxidants like hydroxyl radicals to react with the dye molecules and degrade them into organic intermediates of small molecules until they were decomposed into co2 and h2o so sno2 and mno2 were selected as active components of particle electrode to prepare particle electrode with high catalytic activity 3 1 2 effect of sn mn mass ratio on rhb removal rate fig 4b showed that the three dimensional electriccatalytic systems for rhb degradation efficiency have improved on the increase in the mass ratio of manganese to tin rhb degradation rate enhanced from 81 to 84 when the sn mn ratio increased from 1 2 to 1 1 it was important to highlight that rhb degradation rate reached 94 when the sn mn ratio reached 2 1 with the best degradation effect for rhb in the electrocatalytic degradation process the particles loaded with sno2 had high electrocatalytic activity 25 which could improve the degradation efficiency of rhb moreover a certain amount of mno2 could cooperate with sno2 to improve the catalytic activity of the particle electrode 29 the lattice constants of sno2 and mno2 were similar the two were doped to form a semiconductor solid solution it increased the active site and electron hole of particle electrode provided a large space for lattice oxygen and improved the activity and transport capacity of lattice oxygen in the catalyst it was beneficial for the conversion of o2 to o2 o and ho2 at the particle electrode the exist of a variety of active materials oh o2 o and ho2 accelerated the degradation of rhb electrocatalytic reaction was mainly the reaction of free radicals when the content of mn in particle electrode is too high the negative catalytic reaction of inhibiting free radicals will occur so the sn mn mass ratio is 2 1 in subsequent tests 3 2 physical and chemical characterization of sn mn loaded steel slag zeolite particle electrode 3 2 1 xrf characterization x ray fluorescence spectra xrf of the two particle electrode were scanned and the results were shown in table 1 table 1 showed that the main chemical components of the particle electrode were sio2 fe2o3 cao and al2o3 the reason was that the materials that made up the particle electrode were mainly steel slag and zeolite the steel slag was mainly the oxides of fe and ca and zeolite was mainly the oxides of si and al it was found that the percentage of mno2 4 31 and sno2 2 09 of the loaded particle electrode was significantly higher than that of the unloaded particle electrode and mn sn was about 2 1 this proved that the particle electrode was very successful in loading mn and sn in addition the particle electrode also had other oxides such as na2o tio2 v2o5 so3 cr2o3 sro zno zro2 cuo mgo transition metal oxides e g fe2o3 mno2 v2o5 cr2o3 zno zro2 cuo had an excellent catalytic effect on the degradation of organic compounds 14 according to zhang et al 2019 the degradation effect of rhb on the fe cu kaolin electrode was significantly higher than that on the kaolin electrode 13 so sn mn loaded steel slag zeolite particle electrode was a good choice to degraded organic compounds 3 2 2 sem characterization the particle electrode without load and loaded with sn mn was observed by sem and the results were shown in fig 5 the diameter of the particle electrode was about 5 3 mm and its surface was rough and porous the pore formation of particle electrode was mainly caused by the pore forming agent added in the preparation of particle electrode this porous structure increased the specific surface area of the particle electrode enhanced the mass transfer of the material and also added more active sites so that the particle electrode can adsorb and degrade rhb better 3 2 3 xrd characterization in order to further understand the metal morphology of sn mn loaded steel slag zeolite particle electrode x ray diffraction analysis was performed on the powders of the two particle electrode after grinding the diffraction pattern obtained was shown in fig 6 by comparing with the figures a and b in fig 6 it can be found that the active components mn and sn in the particle electrode mainly exist in the form of mno2 crystal and sno2 crystal moreover it was not difficult to find from the figure that the area of the diffraction peaks of mno2 and sno2 in the charged sn mn particle electrode was larger than that of the unloaded active component in other words the mno2 crystal and sno2 crystal content in the particle electrode loaded with sn mn was higher than that in the particle electrode not loaded with the active component these results demonstrated that the preparation of sn mn particle electrode was very successful 3 3 the influence of key factors on rhb degradation in order to determine the optimal process conditions for degradation of rhb the main factors affecting the degradation of rhb were also studied in the electrolytic cell with sn mn loaded steel slag zeolite particle electrode such as current intensity initial electrolyte dosage electrode positive and negative pole exchange the results were shown in fig 7 3 3 1 the effect of current intensity on rhb degradation when the electrolyte concentration was 0 10 mol l the initial ph value was 5 86 and the initial concentration of rhb was 10 mg l the current intensity was adjusted to 0 125 a 0 250 a and 0 500 a respectively for the experiment as shown in fig 7a with the current intensity increasing the degradation efficiency of rhb by particle electrode respectively reached 70 48 78 80 95 10 it can also be seen from the fig 7a that there were significant differences in the degradation efficiency of rhb by particle electrode under three current intensities the reasons were as follows i oh was formed on the surface of the anode and h2o2 was generated at the cathode which increases with the increase of current intensity 13 30 ii with the increase of current intensity the reactor can polarize more particle electrodes thereby enhancing the redox process and electrical adsorption capacity of the particle electrode surface and promoting the heterogeneous catalysis of the particle electrode surface 31 in addition the larger the number of microelectrodes the wider the reaction area and the stronger the free radicals produced 32 therefore 0 500 a was selected as the optimal current intensity in this experiment 3 3 2 the effect of initial electrolyte dosage on rhb degradation when the intensity of electric current initial ph value and initial concentration of rhb was 0 5 a 5 86 and 10 mg l respectively the initial electrolyte dosage was adjusted to 0 05 mol l 0 10 mol l and 0 20 mol l respectively fig 7b showed that the degradation rate of rhb reached 90 45 89 97 and 89 50 in 180 min respectively it could be found that electrolyte concentration had little effect on the performance of electrocatalytic system the variation trend of the three curves was basically the same due to the reaction mechanism of rhb degradation process was similar which was all degraded after adsorption direct oxidation and indirect oxidation 27 at 60 min the removal rate of low electrolyte concentration was better than the reaction curve of high electrolyte concentration the reason was that the input current and the reactor resistance were constant during the experiment when the electrolyte concentration decreased the voltage at both ends of the reactor increased as a result the electric energy inputs into the reactor increased which made the direct oxidation indirect oxidation electroflocculation and electroadsorption in the reactor more intense therefore 0 05 mol l was selected as the optimal initial electrolyte dosage 3 3 3 the effect of electrode plate s position on rhb degradation under the experimental condition that the current intensity the electrolyte concentration the initial ph value and the initial concentration of rhb was 0 5 a 0 10 mol l 5 86 and 10 mg l we exchanged the reactor s anode and cathode to explore the effect of electrode exchange on rhb degradation as shown in fig 7c under the two conditions there was significant difference in the effect of particle electrode on the degradation of rhb the degradation efficiency of rhb was about 92 33 when the anode was underneath the cathode was above in electrocatalytic system the rhb degradation efficiency of the electrocatalytic system was about 42 03 when the anode was above the cathode was underneath when the particle electrode was in contact with the anode it was polarized by the anode and became a small electrode with a positive charge rhb on the one hand was negatively charged when it was electrolyzed in solution thus a large amount of rhb will be electrically adsorbed and attached to the surface of the particle electrode and removed from the solution on the other hand rhb was a large molecule with a large number of benzene rings which was chemically stable the anode had a high oxidation potential which can destroy the stability of the ring structure so as to realize the degradation of rhb 33 conversely when the cathode was directly below the filled particle electrode was polarized and negatively charged while the rhb itself was negatively charged so the two substances repelled each other the adsorption and degradation effects of rhb are greatly reduced moreover under the condition that the cathode was directly below the particle electrode had a high negative potential and could not destroy the benzene ring structure in rhb 34 as a result rhb degraded relatively better when the anode was directly below it 3 4 uv spectrum scanning in order to explore the change rule of the removal effect of rhb with time the solution with processing time of 0 min 60 min 120 min and 180 min were analyzed by dual beam ultraviolet spectrophotometer fig 8 shows that rhb had the largest ultraviolet absorption peak at 554 nm and its absorption peak strength reduced with the increase of reaction time it is suggested that the concentration of rhb decreased over time after 60 min of illumination the adsorption peak of rhb gradually disappeared by the blue shift 35 this phenomenon indicated that rhb was gradually degraded and in the meanwhile new substances were formed 36 4 conclusions sn mn loaded steel slag zeolite particle electrode was prepared from waste steel slag and zeolite the sn mn loaded steel slag zeolite particle electrode was characterized by sem fluorescence spectrum and xrd when the loading active components were mno2 and sno2 and the mass ratio was 2 1 the catalytic activity of the particles was the highest and more free radicals were generated to degrade rhb the study found that the main factor affecting the removal effect of rhb was the current intensity as the current increased the oxidation capacity of the anode increased more particle electrodes were polarized and more free radicals were produced when the current was 0 500 a the removal rate of rhb was the highest reaching 95 10 electrolyte concentration had little effect on the efficiency of electrocatalytic system during the experiment exchanged the anode and cathode poles of the reactor when the anode was underneath the oxidation potential of the anode was high which could destroy the stability of rhb at this time the degradation effect of rhb was better with a degradation rate of 92 33 in conclusion the tde with sn mn loaded steel slag zeolite particle electrode could degrade rhb effectively which was an efficient and reliable treatment method in the process of implementing the concept of waste control declaration of competing interest we declare that we have no financial and personal relationships with other people or organizations that can inappropriately

13884,the complex water resource security system is composed of natural social and economic factors in this research the security evaluation index system and grade were established from the perspectives of water supply security social security economic security and ecological security on this basis the analytic network process anp was used for the weight calculation of the main influencing factors of water resource security evaluation and the grey relational analysis gra was combined to establish the water resource security evaluation model to evaluate and analyze the security status of water resources from 2008 to 2018 in guizhou the results showed that the water resource security from 2008 to 2018 in guizhou province was relatively stable within relative secure status and critical secure status the security level showed a steadily rising trend and gradually stabilized in the later period which belonged to a relative secure status the evaluation result was consistent with the actual situation the gra anp based water resource security evaluation model can effectively analyze the uncertain relationship and interplay among the evaluation factors and provide more complete decision making information for water resource security evaluation making the evaluation process more reasonable the research can provide certain theoretical basis and reference for the research of water resource security evaluation methods keywords evaluation index evaluation model weight uncertain relationship security status 1 introduction as an indispensable natural resource water resource is one of the key factors that affect human survival and socioeconomic development 1 3 with the rapid growth of population and economy and the impact of climate change an increasing number of areas have problems of water resource security such as water shortage and water environment deterioration which have attracted more and more attention and become a research hotspot 4 8 the term water resources security first appeared internationally in the stockholm water forum in 2000 since the issue of water security was raised many scholars have carried out a lot of research work on the concept definition and evaluation index system of water resources security which has effectively raised the society s attention to water security issues the basic connotation of water resource security refers to the phenomenon that a country or a region in a certain historical development stage suffers water supply shortage and quality deterioration which are not caused by human and natural factors scientific and objective water resource security evaluation is both the important content of water resource security research but also basic research work to solve the problem of coordinated development of economy society and ecological environment 9 12 in recent years some researchers have studied the water resource security evaluation methods from different angles for example van leeuwen et al based on the characteristics of water resource system put forward the concept of water resource security index and pressure index and constructed the index system for security evaluation 13 schneider et al measured water resources security from the perspective of water system capacity and on this basis constructed the index system of water resource supply and demand balance to analyze the degree of basin water resource security 14 raskin et al used the ratio of water withdrawal and water resource quantity to evaluate the degree of water resource security defined it as the vulnerability index of water resources 15 shiklomanov and rodda used the indexes of improvable water resource industrial and agricultural water consumption and domestic water consumption to analyze the security status of water resources 16 existing water resource security evaluations have achieved remarkable results but still have the following problems first water resource security is in an extremely complex system and the evaluation process involves many factors such as water supply society economy and ecological environment so the existing evaluation index system is still insufficient to systematically and comprehensively reflect the real status of water resource security second each factor affecting water resource security has certain effect on the security evaluation but the closeness and interplay among these factors are uncertain existing water resource evaluation methods such as principal component analysis pca anp matter element analysis mea and fuzzy analysis have deficiencies in the uncertain relationship and interplay among the descriptive factors of this system 17 20 currently the research on water resources security mainly focuses on arid and semi arid regions while there are few studies on karst regions guizhou province is located in the karst area of southwest china although rainfall there is abundant the surface water is severely leaked due to the strong karst processes at the same time guizhou s economy has grown continuously in recent years and the contradiction between supply and demand of water resources is prominent therefore guizhou province was selected as the research area which has certain representativeness in view of these this research established the security evaluation index system from the perspectives of water supply security social security economic security and ecological security on this basis gra and anp were combined to establish the water resource security evaluation model to evaluate the security status of water resources in guizhou province the gra anp based water resource security evaluation model can reflect the characteristic that water resource security evaluation is controlled by multiple factors and more importantly it can effectively analyze the uncertain relationship and interplay among the evaluation factors making the evaluation process more reasonable the research in this paper can provide certain theoretical basis and reference for the future research of water resource security evaluation methods 2 evaluation index system of water resource security water resource security is affected by many factors according to the characteristics of data s representive operability and observability this research has evaluated the state of water resource security from four perspectives which are water supply security social security economic security and ecological security based on the national standard and previous research results 21 22 this research selected 13 evaluation indexes to establish the evaluation index system of water resource security and the evaluation level of water resource security was divided into secure status level i relative secure status level ii critical secure status level iii relative insecure status level iv and insecure status level v in table 1 3 gra anp based water resource security evaluation model 3 1 methods of determining the index weight anp is a new systematic decision making method which has developed based on the analytic hierarchy process it takes the interdependence between the internal elements of each layer in the system and the elements feedback delivered from the lower to the upper layer into account making the description of the connection between the objective more accurate 23 24 steps of calculating the index weight by anp method are as follows 1 construction of the judgement matrix assume that the control layer of anp in the water resources safety evaluation system has m elements b1 b2 b3 bm there are n elements in the network layer i e c1 c2 c3 cn where ci has n elements i e ei1 ei2 ein i 1 2 n take the element of control layer bs s 1 2 m as the criterion and the element ejl l 1 2 nj in element cj as the secondary criterion compare the indirect dominance of the elements in group cj according to their extent of influence on the element ejl and then the judgement matrix can be constructed and the priority vector is obtained by the characteristic root method as follows w i j w j 1 i 1 w j 2 i 1 w j n j i 1 w j 1 i 2 w j 2 i 2 w j n j i 2 w j 1 i n i w j 2 i n i w j n j i n i 2 construction of the super matrix the column vectors in the matrix wij are priority vectors of the dominance of the elements in ci to the elements in cj repeat the above steps to finally obtain the super matrix w based on the criterion bs s 1 2 m as follows w c 1 c 2 c n w 11 w 12 w 1 n w 21 w 22 w 2 n w n 1 w n 2 w n n 3 calculation of the limit super matrix in the super matrix w the element wij shows the extent of dominance from the element i to the element j the jth column of the w is the limit relative weight vector of each element in the network layer for j based on the criterion bs and w is as follows w w 11 w 12 w 1 n w 21 w 22 w 2 n w n 1 w n 2 w n n 3 2 evaluation model of water resource security according to the grey system theory a grey system means that a system in which part of information is known and part of information is unknown which is used to solve the uncertainty caused by incomplete information 25 26 for the complicated nonlinear systems such as comprehensive evaluation system of water resource security the effects of water supply social economic and ecological factors on water resource security are known but the extent of the interaction between these factors is uncertain so the comprehensive evaluation system of water resource security is a grey system and water resource security can be evaluated by the grey relational analysis gra this research established a comprehensive evaluation model of water resource security by gra based on the weight of the factors and the specific steps are as follows 1 determination of evaluation object and evaluation criterion set the reference sequence evaluation criterion as x j 0 x j 0 1 x j 0 2 x j 0 n and the comparison sequence evaluation object as x i 0 x i 0 1 x i 0 2 x i 0 n then make the evaluation matrix of the comparison sequence dimensionless based on initiation and matrix x is formed as follows x x 11 x 12 x 1 n x 21 x 22 x 2 n x m 1 x m 2 x m n where xmn denotes the dimensionless value of the nth index of the mth object the dimensionless process is performed by comparing the quantized value with the average value of the standard values at each level and the

8490 0 9295 0 7473 0 5994 the maximum weighted grey correlation r 2max 0 9295 and the level of social security is level iii which belongs to the critical secure status r 3 0 6057 0 8481 0 7454 0 5494 0 4167 the maximum weighted grey correlation r 3max 0 8481 and the level of economic security is level ii which belongs to the relative secure status r 4 0 5088 0 6888 0 9646 0 6559 0 4885 the maximum

level of water resource security is level ii which belongs to the relative secure status similarly the variation of the comprehensive levels of water resources security in guizhou province from 2008 to 2018 can be obtained by the calculation methods above as shown in table 6 to present the variation of water resource security status from 2008 to 2018 more clearly the inter annual variability histogram of water resource security status was made as shown in fig 3 results showed that the water resource security from 2008 to 2018 in guizhou province was relatively stable within relative secure status and critical secure status during which the water security level showed a steadily rising trend from 2008 2011 water resources security was in a critical safety status and the ecological security was in a relative insecure state by referring to the guizhou province water resources bulletin it can be known that rainfall had decreased significantly in recent years floods and droughts occurred frequently in many places and water resources had evaporated seriously especially in 2010 guizhou province encountered a rarely severe drought and there was not enough water for people to drink in many places in addition the rate of ecological water consumption and the water quality in the water functional area had been at a relatively low level for a long time which had led to a relatively low level of water resources security status from 2012 2018 the level of water resources security had been significantly improved the more obvious was that the water consumption per 10 000 yuan of gdp had dropped by 74 83 in 11 years also the water quality in the water functional area from 2012 to 2018 had more than doubled from 2008 to 2011 this is mainly because the change in development ideas in guizhou province in recent years the government has increased investment in water conservancy construction and water resources management year by year and strengthened the implementation of water resources protection policies which has led to a significant increase in indexes such as ecological water consumption and water quality in water functional area in recent years together with the increased rainfall the status of water resources security is in good condition it is worth noting that the social security and the ecological security of water resources have been in a critical secure status in all recent years mainly because the per capita water consumption is high while the rate of ecological water consumption is at a relatively low level 5 conclusion 1 water resources security is affected by many factors according to the characteristics of data s representative operability and observability and in accordance with relevant national standards and previous research results this research analyzed and selected 13 evaluation indexes that affect water resources security from the perspectives of water supply security social security economic security and ecological security and established a water resources security evaluation index system and classification criteria based on the analytic network process anp this paper determined the weight of each impact index in the evaluation system calculated the weight of each index by using the super decisions software and programed the theoretical calculation process of anp on this basis this paper combined grey relational analysis gra and analytic network process anp to establish a water resources security evaluation model that can objectively reflect the characteristics of decision making of multiple factors and the model was applied to evaluate the water resources security in guizhou province results showed that the water resource security from 2008 to 2018 in guizhou province was relatively stable within relative secure status and critical secure status and the security level showed a steadily rising trend and gradually stabilized in the later period after demonstrating the evaluation results were basically consistent with the reality 2 the water resources security evaluation model based on gra anp can not only reflect the characteristic that the water resources security evaluation is affected by multiple factors but also effectively consider the uncertainty relationship and mutual influence between evaluation factors which greatly eliminated the influence of human subjective intentions on the weight making the evaluation process more objective and accurate at the same time on the basis of fully knowing the development trend of evaluation indexes the gra anp model can be used to analyze and predict the security status of water resources providing more complete decision making information for water resources management relevant research in this paper can

13884,the complex water resource security system is composed of natural social and economic factors in this research the security evaluation index system and grade were established from the perspectives of water supply security social security economic security and ecological security on this basis the analytic network process anp was used for the weight calculation of the main influencing factors of water resource security evaluation and the grey relational analysis gra was combined to establish the water resource security evaluation model to evaluate and analyze the security status of water resources from 2008 to 2018 in guizhou the results showed that the water resource security from 2008 to 2018 in guizhou province was relatively stable within relative secure status and critical secure status the security level showed a steadily rising trend and gradually stabilized in the later period which belonged to a relative secure status the evaluation result was consistent with the actual situation the gra anp based water resource security evaluation model can effectively analyze the uncertain relationship and interplay among the evaluation factors and provide more complete decision making information for water resource security evaluation making the evaluation process more reasonable the research can provide certain theoretical basis and reference for the research of water resource security evaluation methods keywords evaluation index evaluation model weight uncertain relationship security status 1 introduction as an indispensable natural resource water resource is one of the key factors that affect human survival and socioeconomic development 1 3 with the rapid growth of population and economy and the impact of climate change an increasing number of areas have problems of water resource security such as water shortage and water environment deterioration which have attracted more and more attention and become a research hotspot 4 8 the term water resources security first appeared internationally in the stockholm water forum in 2000 since the issue of water security was raised many scholars have carried out a lot of research work on the concept definition and evaluation index system of water resources security which has effectively raised the society s attention to water security issues the basic connotation of water resource security refers to the phenomenon that a country or a region in a certain historical development stage suffers water supply shortage and quality deterioration which are not caused by human and natural factors scientific and objective water resource security evaluation is both the important content of water resource security research but also basic research work to solve the problem of coordinated development of economy society and ecological environment 9 12 in recent years some researchers have studied the water resource security evaluation methods from different angles for example van leeuwen et al based on the characteristics of water resource system put forward the concept of water resource security index and pressure index and constructed the index system for security evaluation 13 schneider et al measured water resources security from the perspective of water system capacity and on this basis constructed the index system of water resource supply and demand balance to analyze the degree of basin water resource security 14 raskin et al used the ratio of water withdrawal and water resource quantity to evaluate the degree of water resource security defined it as the vulnerability index of water resources 15 shiklomanov and rodda used the indexes of improvable water resource industrial and agricultural water consumption and domestic water consumption to analyze the security status of water resources 16 existing water resource security evaluations have achieved remarkable results but still have the following problems first water resource security is in an extremely complex system and the evaluation process involves many factors such as water supply society economy and ecological environment so the existing evaluation index system is still insufficient to systematically and comprehensively reflect the real status of water resource security second each factor affecting water resource security has certain effect on the security evaluation but the closeness and interplay among these factors are uncertain existing water resource evaluation methods such as principal component analysis pca anp matter element analysis mea and fuzzy analysis have deficiencies in the uncertain relationship and interplay among the descriptive factors of this system 17 20 currently the research on water resources security mainly focuses on arid and semi arid regions while there are few studies on karst regions guizhou province is located in the karst area of southwest china although rainfall there is abundant the surface water is severely leaked due to the strong karst processes at the same time guizhou s economy has grown continuously in recent years and the contradiction between supply and demand of water resources is prominent therefore guizhou province was selected as the research area which has certain representativeness in view of these this research established the security evaluation index system from the perspectives of water supply security social security economic security and ecological security on this basis gra and anp were combined to establish the water resource security evaluation model to evaluate the security status of water resources in guizhou province the gra anp based water resource security evaluation model can reflect the characteristic that water resource security evaluation is controlled by multiple factors and more importantly it can effectively analyze the uncertain relationship and interplay among the evaluation factors making the evaluation process more reasonable the research in this paper can provide certain theoretical basis and reference for the future research of water resource security evaluation methods 2 evaluation index system of water resource security water resource security is affected by many factors according to the characteristics of data s representive operability and observability this research has evaluated the state of water resource security from four perspectives which are water supply security social security economic security and ecological security based on the national standard and previous research results 21 22 this research selected 13 evaluation indexes to establish the evaluation index system of water resource security and the evaluation level of water resource security was divided into secure status level i relative secure status level ii critical secure status level iii relative insecure status level iv and insecure status level v in table 1 3 gra anp based water resource security evaluation model 3 1 methods of determining the index weight anp is a new systematic decision making method which has developed based on the analytic hierarchy process it takes the interdependence between the internal elements of each layer in the system and the elements feedback delivered from the lower to the upper layer into account making the description of the connection between the objective more accurate 23 24 steps of calculating the index weight by anp method are as follows 1 construction of the judgement matrix assume that the control layer of anp in the water resources safety evaluation system has m elements b1 b2 b3 bm there are n elements in the network layer i e c1 c2 c3 cn where ci has n elements i e ei1 ei2 ein i 1 2 n take the element of control layer bs s 1 2 m as the criterion and the element ejl l 1 2 nj in element cj as the secondary criterion compare the indirect dominance of the elements in group cj according to their extent of influence on the element ejl and then the judgement matrix can be constructed and the priority vector is obtained by the characteristic root method as follows w i j w j 1 i 1 w j 2 i 1 w j n j i 1 w j 1 i 2 w j 2 i 2 w j n j i 2 w j 1 i n i w j 2 i n i w j n j i n i 2 construction of the super matrix the column vectors in the matrix wij are priority vectors of the dominance of the elements in ci to the elements in cj repeat the above steps to finally obtain the super matrix w based on the criterion bs s 1 2 m as follows w c 1 c 2 c n w 11 w 12 w 1 n w 21 w 22 w 2 n w n 1 w n 2 w n n 3 calculation of the limit super matrix in the super matrix w the element wij shows the extent of dominance from the element i to the element j the jth column of the w is the limit relative weight vector of each element in the network layer for j based on the criterion bs and w is as follows w w 11 w 12 w 1 n w 21 w 22 w 2 n w n 1 w n 2 w n n 3 2 evaluation model of water resource security according to the grey system theory a grey system means that a system in which part of information is known and part of information is unknown which is used to solve the uncertainty caused by incomplete information 25 26 for the complicated nonlinear systems such as comprehensive evaluation system of water resource security the effects of water supply social economic and ecological factors on water resource security are known but the extent of the interaction between these factors is uncertain so the comprehensive evaluation system of water resource security is a grey system and water resource security can be evaluated by the grey relational analysis gra this research established a comprehensive evaluation model of water resource security by gra based on the weight of the factors and the specific steps are as follows 1 determination of evaluation object and evaluation criterion set the reference sequence evaluation criterion as x j 0 x j 0 1 x j 0 2 x j 0 n and the comparison sequence evaluation object as x i 0 x i 0 1 x i 0 2 x i 0 n then make the evaluation matrix of the comparison sequence dimensionless based on initiation and matrix x is formed as follows x x 11 x 12 x 1 n x 21 x 22 x 2 n x m 1 x m 2 x m n where xmn denotes the dimensionless value of the nth index of the mth object the dimensionless process is performed by comparing the quantized value with the average value of the standard values at each level and the equation is as follows 1 x k x 0 k 1 n j 1 n x j 0 k where x k represents the dimensionless value of the kth evaluation factor in the water resources safety evaluation index system x 0 k denotes the actual value of each evaluation factor x j 0 k denotes the standard value of each evaluation index in the evaluation criterion of water resource security where k 1 2 n 2 calculation of the grey relational coefficient the equation is as follows 2 x i k m i n i m i n k x i k x j k r m a x i m a x k x i k x j k x i k x j k r m a x i m a x k x i k x j k where ξ i k is the correlation coefficient between the k th index and the k th optimal index of the i th evaluation object in the water resources safety evaluation system ρ is the distinguishing coefficient usually ρ 0 5 k 1 2 n i 1 2 m 3 weighted grey correlation calculate the weighted grey correlation considering the weight difference between the factors based on the weight of each index determined by anp 3 r i k 1 n w k x i k where w k is the weight of each impact index r i is the grey weighted correlation degree of the i th evaluation index to the ideal object in the water resources safety evaluation system and i 1 2 m k 1 2 n 4 analysis of evaluation set up a correlation sequence of evaluation subject according to the calculated value of weighted grey correlation and then determine the level of evaluation of water resource security based on the maximum correlation rule which means the greater the correlation is the better the correlation with level set is 4 analysis of example 4 1 study area guizhou province is located

to 2018 can be obtained by the calculation methods above as shown in table 6 to present the variation of water resource security status from 2008 to 2018 more clearly the inter annual variability histogram of water resource security status was made as shown in fig 3 results showed that the water resource security from 2008 to 2018 in guizhou province was relatively stable within relative secure status and critical secure status during which the water security level showed a steadily rising trend from 2008 2011 water resources security was in a critical safety status and the ecological security was in a relative insecure state by referring to the guizhou province water resources bulletin it can be known that rainfall had decreased significantly in recent years floods and droughts occurred frequently in many places and water resources had evaporated seriously especially in 2010 guizhou province encountered a rarely severe drought and there was not enough water for people to drink in many places in addition the rate of ecological water consumption and the water quality in the water functional area had been at a relatively low level for a long time which had led to a relatively low level of water resources security status from 2012 2018 the level of water resources security had been significantly improved the more obvious was that the water consumption per 10 000 yuan of gdp had dropped by 74 83 in 11 years also the water quality in the water functional area from 2012 to 2018 had more than doubled from 2008 to 2011 this is mainly because the change in development ideas in guizhou province in recent years the government has increased investment in water conservancy construction and water resources management year by year and strengthened the implementation of water resources protection policies which has led to a significant increase in indexes such as ecological water consumption and water quality in water functional area in recent years together with the increased rainfall the status of water resources security is in good condition it is worth noting that the social security and the ecological security of water resources have been in a critical secure status in all recent years mainly because the per capita water consumption is high while the rate of ecological water consumption is at a relatively low level 5 conclusion 1 water resources security is affected by many factors according to the characteristics of data s representative operability and observability and in accordance with relevant national standards and previous research results this research analyzed and selected 13 evaluation indexes that affect water resources security from the perspectives of water supply security social security economic security and ecological security and established a water resources security evaluation index system and classification criteria based on the analytic network process anp this paper determined the weight of each impact index in the evaluation system calculated the weight of each index by using the super decisions software and programed the theoretical calculation process of anp on this basis this paper combined grey relational analysis gra and analytic network process anp to establish a water resources security evaluation model that can objectively reflect the characteristics of decision making of multiple factors and the model was applied to evaluate the water resources security in guizhou province results showed that the water resource security from 2008 to 2018 in guizhou province was relatively stable within relative secure status and critical secure status and the security level showed a steadily rising trend and gradually stabilized in the later period after demonstrating the evaluation results were basically consistent with the reality 2 the water resources security evaluation model based on gra anp can not only reflect the characteristic that the water resources security evaluation is affected by multiple factors but also effectively consider the uncertainty relationship and mutual influence between evaluation factors which greatly eliminated the influence of human subjective intentions on the weight making the evaluation process more objective and accurate at the same time on the basis of fully knowing the development trend of evaluation indexes the gra anp model can be used to analyze and predict the security status of water resources providing more complete decision making information for water resources management relevant research in this paper can
