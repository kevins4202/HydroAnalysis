20640,hydrodynamic characteristics of fish like propulsion have been of interest to researchers in the fields of fluid mechanics and biology the paper aims to present a systematic hydrodynamic study to further understand propulsion performance of fish like swimming the study is a numerical investigation based on a unified kinematic model and different self propulsion undulation conditions propulsion performance and hydrodynamic characteristics are analyzed according to the simulation results the theory demonstration shows that the propulsion efficiency is independent of the frequency when the frequency is large enough with increasing wavelength the undulation mode gradually becomes the oscillation mode and performance metrics tend to limit values the relations between propulsion performance and fluid field non dimensional numbers are also discussed the results show that a high efficiency propulsion for fish requires a high s t and low r e conditions an optimization index that emphasizes time cost for the entire swimming process is proposed to optimize the swimming for migrating a given distance under the optimal condition froude efficiency for the fish like undulation is about 0 52 with a 2 4bl s of swimming speed the findings will offer some new insights into understanding the swimming mechanism of fish like propulsion keywords fish like propulsion hydrodynamic

paradox proposed by gray 1936 nearly ninety years ago the studies on swimming mechanism have continued steadily since then fish have shown stronger stability greater maneuverability and higher propulsive efficiency than modern man made underwater vehicles hence the research field has attracted considerable attention in the past half century since lighthill proposed the slender body theory ebt lighthill 1960 1970 the study for bcf propulsion has been an important topic in the literature bcf body and or caudal fin propulsion is the swimming mode adopted about 85 of the fish species the bcf fish generate thrust relying on the lateral undulation of the body and caudal fin the mode is considered to have great advantages of high speed and high swimming efficiency for fish swimming compared with mpf median and or paired fin propulsion mode scaradozzi et al 2017 fuller understanding to fish swimming mechanisms could make it easier to guide and develop high performance underwater robots salazar et al 2018 sahoo et al 2019 the bulk of recent works in the field is concerned with computational fluid dynamics cfd with the advancements in computer techniques lamas and vidal 2020 reviewed the state of the works in the field of biomimetic hydrodynamics and numerical techniques over the past decades cfd technique provides important information of fluid field avoiding limitations of experimental conditions for the study of fish propulsion maertens et al 2017 verma et al 2018 feng et al 2020 some studies are conducted based on two dimensional hydrodynamic simulations that require less computational resources and time costs meanwhile two dimensional simulations could still provide some useful insights for understanding fish swimming mechanism xiao et al 2011 presented a numerical study on the hydrodynamic performance of undulation foil in the near wake of d section cylinder li et al 2019 reported that the wake and the pressure resulting from the undulating fish are important factors affecting the froude efficiency based on the study of fish swarm the results showed that fish group could choose different swarm configuration to adapt to the environment and tasks sun et al 2020 reported that the energy extraction efficiency of the undulatory airfoil with a thicker leading edge becomes higher at moderate to high reynolds numbers they found that the propulsive performance can be considerably affected by the leading edge radius at only low and moderate reynolds numbers besides some studies also explored the collective behaviors and passive hydrodynamic interactions in different schooling arrangements based on two dimensional fish like models khalid et al 2018 dai et al 2018 park and sung 2018 li et al 2019 through using numerical simulations it provides an understanding to evaluate the hydrodynamic performance and explore the wake characteristics of fish swimming interesting to note that the swimming efficiency of fish involved in above numerical studies are generally less than 0 5 the result does not reflect the advantages of fish swimming compared to man made underwater vehicles most of these studies used tethered methods to simulate the fish swimming where the velocity of the fish are considered constant irrespective of the hydrodynamic forces the method is widely used to simulate a constant velocity propulsion dong and lu 2007 liu et al 2012 thekkethil et al 2017 zhao and dou 2019 however the motion of the fish is usually transient where swimming velocity varies with changes of undulation profiles thus for exploring transient characteristics of fish and flow fluid a self propulsion study is necessary where the swimming velocity and acceleration rely on net thrust at any moment self propulsion studies have been undertaken to evaluate swimming performance and explore optimal swimming mode zhu et al 2014 conducted a systematic parametric study to investigate the effects of flexibility on hydrodynamic performance quantities such as the cruising speed swimming power and efficiency they presented that moderate flexibility is beneficial to symmetry preservation in the wake while excessive flexibility can trigger symmetry breaking cui et al 2017 reported that the forward speed of the fish is closely related to the tail beat frequency while the swimming efficiency is increased with the tail beat frequency and amplitude coefficient thekkethil et al 2020 used a unified kinematics model to study propulsion characteristics of different types bcf fish like self propulsion they found that the smaller wavelength for undulation motion is more effective over this smaller ranger of propulsion velocity table 1 shows a study summary involving some two dimensional numerical studies based on the fish like propulsion the table shows the numerical method the type of propulsion systems the kinematics and two fluid non dimensional numbers adopted in the corresponding study although a number of studies have discussed swimming performance and fluid field characteristics for undulation motion at different conditions there are still academic controversial points on the undulation mechanism due to lack of reliable experimental results for undulation wavelength some studies showed that there is an optimal specific wavelength that maximizes the swimming speed and the thrust force for an undulatory swimmer bale et al 2015 nangia et al 2017 however thekkethil et al 2017 presented that mean thrust coefficient of the undulating foil increases with increasing wavelength for propulsive efficiency the definition of efficiency has not yet been unified quasi propulsive efficiency cui et al 2017 maertens et al 2015 froude efficiency borazjani and sotiropoulos 2008 sun et al 2020 and net propulsive efficiency thekkethil et al 2018 zhao and dou 2019 are widely used to evaluation the swimming performance of fish like propulsion no studies reveal differences among the different efficiency indexes for swimming performance optimization cui et al 2017 presented that the swimming efficiency is increased with the tail beat frequency generally the swimming speed also increases with increasing frequency the result that efficiency and swimming speed are increased with the undulation frequency is not in line with experiment results tytell and lauder 2004 it is still an open question that whether there is an optimal kinematic profile for the undulation mode in order to obtain optimal hydrodynamic performance these intriguing problems will be further investigated in this work a systematic study is still necessary to fully understand the hydrodynamic performance of the fish like propulsion in the work a more comprehensive study on performance evaluation and optimization for fish like propulsion is presented transient and dynamic steady propulsion performance are discussed based on a unified kinematic model and different self propulsion undulation conditions a new optimization index that emphasizes time cost for the entire swimming process is proposed the rest of the paper is organized as follows in section 2 geometry and kinematic models for fish like propulsion are built in section 3 some metrics are discussed to evaluate propulsion performance in section 4 cfd numerical methods and error estimation are described in section 5 numerical results are presented and discussed in detail effects of kinematic factors and fluid non dimensional numbers on performance are discussed an optimization goal function is proposed to explore the optimal swimming performance in section 6 some conclusions are drawn 2 kinematic model the present study of fish like propulsion is based on a two dimensional kinematic model the model was used to simulate subcarangiform fish swimming such as rainbow trout liu et al 1997 xiao et al 2011 the fish like object like a rainbow trout is abbreviated as fish for convenience in the work the model is adopted to model the undulation motion of fish centerline the lateral displacement equation of the centerline is used as follows 1 h x t a x sin 2 π x λ t t where l is the fish centerline length and always equal to 0 1m in the study the variable t represents the time x is the streamwise coordinate measured from the tip of fish head t is the undulation period λ is the undulation wavelength and a x is the lateral amplitude of undulation and described as follows 2 a x l 0 351 sin x l 1 796 0 359 the centerline motion can be calculated by formulas 1 and 2 as shown in fig 1 the maximum undulation amplitude a x m a x is about 0 1 l in addition naca foil is widely used to model the fish body to add thickness to the fish centerline a fourth order naca0012 foil equation is used as follows 3 d s t m a x 0 2 0 2969 s l 0 1260 s l 0 3516 s l 2 0 2843 s l 3 0 1015 s l 4 where d s is the distance of the fish outline normal to and away from the fish centerline at position s and t m a x is the maximum thickness and equal to 0 125 l as shown in fig 2 in the study newton raphson method is used to update positions of centerline and keep the total length constant the method prevents the fish centerline from being stretched or compressed throughout motion the fish outline is obtained based on the foil equation it is a widely used method to simulate fish undulation by using foil undulation however there are still some differences between the fish and the foil for example the head of the foil has a smaller curvature radius at the nose liao et al 2003 it is to be expected that simulation results will not precisely match that of a real rainbow trout the motion of fish body modeled by the foil is shown in fig 3 3 performance metrics in the study all performance metrics are related to speed of fish propulsion fish propulsion is intermittent in nature where the speed is time wise varying with unsteady flow fish are usually under a dynamic steady state to maintain low energy consumption where the net thrust is almost zero and swimming speed shows the periodic fluctuation of small amplitude the average streamwise swimming speed of fish under a dynamic steady state is abbreviated as swimming speed u s for convenience all metrics below also aim to evaluate performance of fish under a dynamic steady state 3 1 ebt efficiency efficiency η is used to measure the energy conversion and loss throughout swimming in the study three different efficiency metrics are used to evaluate the self propulsion state of fish swimming the differences among the efficiency metrics are also discussed elongated body theory ebt developed by lighthill 1960 is an inviscid flow theory to evaluate force and efficiency for a slender fish the theory is widely used to predict swimming performance for a fish like motion although it has proven to have some defects such as overestimating efficiency and ignoring effects of wake vortices however it can still be considered as a performance index due to the low cost of calculation in ebt the time averaged thrust power efficiency are 4 t e b t p e b t u s 1 2 ρ h t u s h x 2 ζ p e b t ρ u s ζ h t u s h x h t η e b t t e b t u s p e b t where ζ is the area of the circumscribing circle of the cross section defined in ebt ρ ζ is the virtual mass ζ π 4 in 2d u s is the swimming speed elongated body theory cannot predict the u s so that the speed u s depends on numerical calculation in the study other values are calculated at the trailing edge x l by using complex functions the lateral displacement h x t can also be written as 5 h x t a x cos 2 π x λ t t π 2 re a x e 2 π x λ 2 π t t π 2 i re a x e i ω t where the symbol re represents the real part of the complex function the complex function h x the complex function a x and the angular frequency ω are respectively 6 h x t a x e i ω t a x a x e 2 π x λ π 2 i ω 2 π t partial derivatives for the h x t are 7 h t i ω a x e i ω t h x a x e i ω t the amplitude a 0 resp a 0 of the complex number a l resp a l is defined as 8 a l a 0 e i θ a l a 0 e i α using these complex functions the η e b t is also written as 9 η e b t 1 2 x 1 x x sin δ where the variables x and δ are respectively 10 x ω a 0 u s a 0 δ α θ the detailed derivation process can be referred to maertens s study maertens et al 2015 the efficiency calculation is more complicated using complex functions but the relation between kinematics parameters is more clear which is useful for the work 3 2 froude efficiency froude propulsive efficiency tytell and lauder 2004 is a measure of hydrodynamic efficiency which does not take into account additional mechanical energy loss of a system it is only useful in a dynamic steady state and not in acceleration motion it is defined as the ratio of useful power output to total power and written as 11 η f useful power total power f t u s f t u s p s i d e where f t and p s i d e represent average thrust and average power loss over a swimming cycle thrust need to be calculated to obtain froude propulsive efficiency under the dynamic steady state however the state means thrust is approximately equal to drag so that the net thrust f x is almost equal to zero it is more challenging to make the distinction between thrust and drag it is still possible but there is no simple theoretical method to make the distinction borazjani and sotiropoulos 2008 proposed a numerical method to achieve the distinction based on effects of forces net thrust f x can be defined as 12 f x t σ p n x τ x i n i d s i x y z where n i is the i th direction component of unit normal on element face d s τ is viscous stress tensor the subscript x indicates x axis direction and σ represents the whole fish outline net thrust f x t could contribute to either drag f d t or thrust f t t depending on whether f x t is negative or positive thus f x t is also written as 13 f x t f t t f d t to separate the two contributions thrust f t t and drag f d t are defined as follows 14 f t t f t p f t ν 1 2 σ p n x d s σ p n x d s 1 2 σ τ x i n i d s σ τ x i n i d s 15 f d t f d p f d ν 1 2 σ p n x d s σ p n x d s 1 2 σ τ x i n i d s σ τ x i n i d s power loss induced by lateral displacement is given by 16 p s i d e σ p n y u y d s σ τ y i n i u y d s where u y is the lateral undulation velocity from the time derivative of the lateral displacement 3 3 quasi propulsive efficiency quasi propulsive efficiency is considered a new rational non dimensional index of propulsive fitness of fish and fish like mechanisms maertens et al 2015 for a self propulsion fish the quasi propulsive efficiency is defined as follows 17 η q p r u s p i n where u s is swimming speed and r is towed drag and is obtained by towing a fish body without bending at the speed u s power input p i n is estimated as follows 18 p i n σ u f f d s where u f is local velocity on the fish body and f is local hydrodynamic force on the fish body under the two dimensional dynamic steady state the formula 18 can be further simplified as 19 p i n σ u x f x u y f y d s σ u s f x d s p s i d e u s f x p s i d e the average value of net thrust f x is almost equal to zero under a dynamic steady state thus the average value of power input p i n is also written as 20 p i n p s i d e the advantage of quasi propulsive efficiency is that it avoids the distinction between thrust and drag the towed drag r can also capture the hydrodynamic features of hulls so that it can be used to compared the performance of different vehicles maertens et al 2015 3 4 non dimensional coefficients the following non dimensional coefficients are used to characterize self propulsion motion of fish these non dimensional force coefficients and fluid non dimensional numbers are defined as follows reynolds number r e is the ratio of the inertial forces to the viscous forces and written by 21 r e u s l ν where u s is the swimming speed of fish l is the length of fish centerline and ν is the kinematic viscosity of water strouhal number s t s a non dimensional number describing oscillating flow mechanisms it is given as 22 s t f a p u s where f is the undulatory frequency of fish a p is the maximum peak to peak amplitude of lateral undulation and u s is the swimming speed of fish force coefficients are also discussed to characterize the self propulsion motion these coefficients are defined as 23 c f f x 0 5 ρ u s 2 l c t f t 0 5 ρ u s 2 l c d f d 0 5 ρ u s 2 l c p p s i d e 0 5 ρ u s 3 l where c f is net thrust force coefficient c t is thrust coefficient c d are drag coefficient and c p is lateral power loss coefficient when a fish is under a dynamic steady state its net thrust is almost equal to zero as a result c f is also equal to zero and c t is close to c d 4 method and verification 4 1 numerical method most performance metrics discussed above cannot be directly calculated from existing theoretical models therefore the study of performance evaluation is mainly depended on the numerical method for fluid system a self propulsion fish like motion into an incompressible viscous fluid is focused in the work governing equations for fluid flow are the two dimensional unsteady incompressible navier stokes equations in addition the computational domain contains a two dimensional flexible deforming fish body the dynamic mesh model is also applied to model flows where the computational domain is changing with the flexible motion with respect to dynamic meshes the governing equations solved are written as 24 u u g 0 t ρ u ρ u u u g p μ 2 u where u is the flow velocity u g is the mesh velocity of the moving mesh ρ is the fluid density p is the pressure and μ is dynamic viscosity the whole fluid system is simulated based on the cfd software ansys fluent a no slip boundary condition is applied to the deforming fish body 25 u u f where u f is local velocity on the fish body in this work the 1 dof self propulsion motion is focused and the fish is only able to do undulatory motion periodically and swim along the streamwise direction thus the velocity u f can be decomposed into two parts 26 u f u s u d e f where u s is local swimming velocity on the fish body along streamwise direction u d e f is the local deforming velocity on the fish body the deforming velocity u d e f is only depended on the undulatory motion defined in eq 1 the undulatory motion is a prescribed motion which is presented in section 2 the fish swimming is an unprescribed motion where the subsequent swimming velocity is depended on the net thrust at current time the self propulsion swimming velocity u s can be calculated by newton s law 27 f x m d u s d t where f x is the net thrust defined in eq 12 and u s is the instant swimming speed the fish mass m is a constant and equal to 1kg for convenience in the study fluent allows users to describe the complex deforming motion and control the positions of boundaries using user defined functions udfs the self propulsion swimming speed is calculated based on the definitions above at each time step besides the prescribed undulation motion is used to control fish body deformation the calculation processes are coded as a macro function and linked to fluent the macro function is executed at every time step to control the fish motion the fluid computational domain zone 1 is a rectangular zone which is meshed with structured meshes zone 2 which contains the fish is meshed with triangular unstructured meshes the two zones are independent and overlapping connected by an overset interface the interface connects different cell zones by interpolating cell data in the overlapping regions the computational domain is shown in fig 4 as the background mesh the meshes in zone 1 is always static and does not involve the mesh motion mesh deformation motion is concentrated in zone 2 affected by flexible deformation of fish body some meshes that do not meet the quality requirements in the zone 2 are marked based the size and skewness criteria the new positions of these meshes are updated based on the spring smoothing and remeshing methods at each time step throughout the simulation the swimming speed u s obtained from calculation is not directly given the fish but the whole zone 2 at every time step the whole zone 2 moves forward at the speed u s the meshes in zone 2 and the fish boundary are given a forward speed as a result the fish body boundary get a undulation speed from a prescribed motion and a forward speed from calculation as described in eq 26 the meshes in zone 2 also seem to get a forward speed however it does not affect the simulation because the boundary motion conditions are not affected by these meshes an advantage of overset technique is that component mesh and background mesh can be generated separately with fewer constrains more importantly zone 1 does not require dynamic mesh models and mesh deformation so that simulation time cost can be reduced compared with controlling the skewness of the deforming meshes in a larger computational domain it is easier to control deforming sizes of local meshes on zone 2 the adoption of overset technique is a compromise between time cost and simulation accuracy local region zone 2 near the fish are filled with unstructured meshes to ensure mesh quality throughout deforming motion and the background mesh are filled with structured meshes to reduce the time cost of calculating the fluid field away from the fish in mesh overlap areas receptor cells and donor cells are given nearly identical resolutions avoiding to generate orphan cells and leading to better solution accuracy when an overset interface is set as shown in fig 4 three main steps need to be completed namely hole cutting overlap minimization and donor search ansys inc 2020 the process called hole cutting marks cells lying outside of flow region as dead cells overlap minimization is used to minimize lapping regions by converting unnecessary solve cells into receptor cells and converting unnecessary receptor cells into dead cells in the process called donor search ansys fluent automatically searched valid solve meshes for each receptor mesh and the solve meshes are used as donor candidates to establishing the connectivity between two zones after these steps are completed the interpolation can be performed to transfer information from donor meshes to receptor meshes throughout the simulation in the work the least square interpolation method is used to interpolate cell data in the overlapping regions other boundary conditions are also marked in fig 4 the left boundary is set to velocity inlet boundary the velocity of the inlet boundary is zero and the fish mainly rely on the own undulation to swim forward the right boundary is set to pressure outlet boundary the upper and lower sides of the fluid domain is set to wall boundary the local meshes near the fish body is refined to ensure high boundary mesh resolution the computational flow field presents laminar flow characteristics because swimming speeds of fish do not exceed 4 5 bl s body lengths per second in the study the fish length is 0 1m so that the maximum r e of the external flow field does not exceed 45 000 a double precision solver is used to solve the transient laminar fluid model based on the pressure based coupled algorithm all discrete formats of space and time are second order in order to ensure calculation accuracy 4 2 discretization error estimation error estimation is necessary to ensure a high reliability for cfd study there are generally three contributions to the numerical error round off error iterative error and discretization error in principle the round off error can be decreased and ignored by using a double precision solver the iterative error is also decreased with increasing machine accuracy as a result the discretization error is usually the main contributor to the numerical error eça and hoekstra 2013 in the study a discretization error estimation is executed by calculating a numerical uncertainty based on grid refinement the method proposed by eça and hoekstra 2014 builds error estimators and uses least square method to estimate the discretization error even if the exact solution is unknown a qualitative dependency study is first carried out in order to find a study scope of mesh and time step a case with 5hz of undulation frequency is used different grids are used which consist of m 1 99 645 cells m 2 171 803 cells m 3 245 594 cells and m 4 309 751 cells to study mesh dependency different time step sizes are used which consist of δ t 1 1 200 t δ t 2 1 266 t δ t 3 1 400 t and δ t 4 1 800 t to study time dependence the results are shown in fig 5 differences among these results are subtle and the four grids with the same time step 1 400 t are used to do the error estimation the discretization error estimation aims to estimate the uncertainty of a given numerical result even if the exact solution is unknown the basic formula is given 28 ϕ e x a c t ϕ i λ ϕ where ϕ is any flow quantity ϕ e x a c t is the exact solution of the quantity ϕ i is the numerical solution of the quantity λ ϕ is the estimated uncertainty the basic equation to estimate the discretization error ϵ ϕ is 29 ϵ ϕ ϕ i ϕ 0 α h i p 0 where ϕ 0 is the estimate of the exact solution α is a constant to be determined h i is the typical cell size and p 0 is the observed order of grid convergence usually p 0 is equal to the theoretical order of numerical method thus p 0 is equal to 2 in the work it is possible to determine these unknown quantities based on the least square method and power series expansions the estimation scheme used in the work is the weighted two term expansion with second order terms here main steps are omitted and a detailed description of the error estimation is given in eca s study eça and hoekstra 2014 the swimming speed u s and the drag coefficient c d are selected as estimation objects the estimation results are given in table 2 the four simulation cases are carried out with the same time step 1 400 t for the estimated uncertainty of the speed low density mesh get a better result conversely high density mesh get a better result for the estimated uncertainty of the drag coefficient which is expected as a compromise between time cost and calculation accuracy the grid m 3 within an acceptable error range is adopted in the work 5 performance evaluation and optimization 5 1 simulation results the work focus on the effects of undulation frequency and wavelength on propulsion performance wavelength and frequency are two study variables other parameters are considered constants fig 6 presents the range of the frequency and the wavelength applied in the work wavelength is measured by the body length of the fish bl each colorful spot represents a simulation case carried out in the work in fig 6 a the colorful bar represents the range of reynolds number under the dynamic steady state in general reynolds number increases with increasing frequency and wavelength while strouhal number decreases with increasing frequency and wavelength as shown in fig 6 b although a wide range of swimming conditions is considered the strouhal number under the dynamic steady state is concentrated on the range form 0 25 to 0 35 it is also found that a wide variety of fishes swim within the range of s t from 0 2 to 0 35 triantafyllou et al 1993 taylor et al 2003 smits 2019 the undulation shapes at different wavelengths are shown in fig 7 the higher the frequency the faster the undulation speed but the undulation shape is the same with increasing wavelength the undulation mode gradually becomes the oscillation mode the pressure suction based thrust generation mechanism can be applied to the undulation mode müller et al 1997 while thrust in oscillating motion is generated by the formation of low and high pressure regions another feature is that the wall vortex attached to the fish body is elongated as the wavelength increases as shown by the black streamline in fig 7 the pressure difference between the two sides of the fish is larger as the wavelength increases due to the greater pushing area between the tail and water with increasing wavelength the pushing area gradually becomes horizontal which reduces the momentum transfer in streamwise direction and increases the energy loss in lateral direction thekkethil et al 2017 although the different kinematic parameters lead to the different performance the self propulsion process form a static state to a dynamic steady state for fish swimming is similar even under different motion conditions the static accelerating cruising process of the fish is shown in fig 9 based on vorticity contours throughout the whole process the temporal variations of the fish swimming speed are shown in fig 10 a the accelerating cruising process can be roughly divided into three stages the first stage is the startup stage which corresponds to the first and second swimming cycle the acceleration of the fish in the start stage reaches the maximum value with the generation of starting vortices the starting vortices including a clockwise vortex and a counter clockwise vortex are generated at the leading edge and fall off at the trailing edge one after another due to a undulation pressure difference between the left and right sides as shown in fig 8 two vortices form a dipole due to the almost static flow field and the little convection of momentum transfer the dipole also promotes the formation of local jets thereby further increasing the thrust during the startup process the startup process is accompanied by the formation of two dipoles the dipoles are also shown in the vorticity contour in fig 8 the dipole formation is absent in the third cycle due to the increase of wake velocity the phenomena have also been discussed in depth in some past studies marais et al 2012 thekkethil et al 2020 the second stage is the acceleration process the wake flow generally presents a regular staggered vortex arrangement as shown in the vorticity contour at 6 0 t and 8 5 t the swimming speed increases gradually and smoothly but the acceleration decreases due to the increasing drag during the process as shown in fig 10 a the entire fluid system gradually develop to a dynamic steady state some force coefficients defined in formula 23 are shown in fig 10 the figures do not show the coefficient variations of the startup stage because the swimming speed at this stage is so small that the coefficients is very large after nondimensionalization the third stage is the dynamic steady state the swimming speed tends to a steady value with zero of net thrust force the final average value of the coefficient c f is zero as shown in fig 10 b fig 10 c and d show the temporal variations of c t and c p and they are all decreasing and eventually reach steady values under the dynamic steady state the coefficients under different swimming conditions shows the similar variation trend 5 2 effects of kinematic factors on performance the effects of different frequencies and wavelengths on the performance are reflected in the changes of the coefficients the results are summarized in fig 11 fig 11 a shows the variations of swimming speed with increasing frequency the swimming speed is linear with the frequency increasing with increasing frequency the average thrust coefficient and the average lateral power coefficient both decrease monotonously with increasing frequency as shown in fig 11 c and e and the lower the frequency the greater the gradient it is noted that thrust and lateral power loss increase with increasing frequency as shown in fig 10 the trends of force and force coefficient are opposite from the mathematics standpoint the high power function of speed at the denominator position plays a primary role in the non dimensionalization process causing the decrease of coefficients instead for different wavelengths the speed increase monotonously while the average thrust coefficient and the average lateral power coefficient both decrease monotonously with increasing wavelength as shown in fig 11 b d and f compared with the frequency the changes are slight as the wavelength increases the variation trend gradually flattens and performance metrics tend to limit values from the kinematic standpoint the limit state reflects a pure oscillating motion of a foil as discussed in section 5 1 the undulation mode gradually becomes the oscillation mode and the undulatory fish gradually becomes an oscillating foil with increasing wavelength the changes of metrics reflect the difference between the undulation mode and the oscillation mode when the wavelength is relatively small undulation mode the thrust generation depend on the pushing area the pushing area gradually becomes horizontal as the wavelength increases as a result thrust generation is gradually independent on the wavelength and dependent on the low and high pressure regions which are related to the body shape thekkethil et al 2017 the variations of the three efficiency under different kinematic conditions are shown in fig 13 the three different efficiencies are widely used in hydrodynamic performance evaluation quasi propulsive efficiency also depends on towed drag r which is obtained by towing a fish body without bending at a constant velocity as shown in fig 12 the towed drag at other different towed velocity can be obtained by interpolation based on the results the swimming efficiency ranges from 0 4 to 0 8 under different undulation conditions the η e b t is higher than the η f while the η q p is generally lower in essence elongated body theory is an inviscid flow theory and does not take account into viscous shear stress so that it underestimates the lateral power loss and overestimates the swimming efficiency the η f relies on the estimation for thrust produced by a swimming fish it is difficult to separate the thrust from the net thrust usually the separation method is completely numerical and has no clear physical significance the disadvantage of the η q p is that it is not strictly an efficiency hence its range is not strictly 0 to 1 the calculation of the η q p actually uses towed drag instead of undulation drag during swimming undulation drag is equal to thrust at a dynamic steady state hence the η q p underestimates the thrust and the swimming efficiency in short ebt efficiency and froude efficiency are intuitive measures of hydrodynamic efficiency but quasi propulsive efficiency can only be used to minimize the energy consumption maertens et al 2015 it should be noted that the η e b t and the η f remain almost constant with increasing frequency it shows that frequency has no effect on efficiency the frequency is always related to the swimming speed in a dynamic steady state the swimming speed u s is linear with the frequency f hence the u s can be approximately expressed as 30 u s a f b where the a and b are constants an intuitive fact is that the swimming speed should be zero when the frequency is zero hence the b should be equal to zero however when b is 0 a paradox arises here the s t is always a constant due to f a u s a a the conclusion is inconsistent with both experiment study and simulation study the relations between the speed and the frequency at different wavelengths are further shown in fig 14 the linear relation under different wavelengths always works however a and b vary with the wavelength the results of curve fitting show that the range of the b is between 0 to 1 i e b is a small number but not zero the linear relation also reported in webb s experiment study webb et al 1984 when the frequency is large enough the b can be ignored and the u s is approximately proportional to the f by taking the results into formula 10 x can be written as 31 x 2 π f a 0 u s a 0 2 π f a 0 a f b a 0 2 π a 0 a a 0 an advantage of introducing complex function into ebt is that it can separate variables from a coupling equation 4 the complex function a x is independent on frequency according to the definition eq 6 thus a 0 a 0 and δ derived from a x are independent on frequency hence when the frequency is large enough x and η e b t is also independent on frequency according to formula 9 although the conclusion is derived from ebt it can also apply to froude efficiency η f as shown in fig 13 this is an empirical inference because ebt efficiency and froude efficiency are both intuitive measures of hydrodynamic efficiency it does not work for quasi propulsive efficiency η q p because η q p depends on not only the swimming motion but also the towed process besides the conclusion is based on the linear relation between the swimming speed and the frequency under the dynamic steady state the conclusion does not work when the fish is at the startup or accelerating state another limitation is that the frequency is required large enough in fact when the f is larger than 1hz the efficiency is largely unaffected by the frequency for the wavelength the quasi propulsive efficiency does not show a significant difference under different wavelength conditions as shown in fig 11 b the η q p always remains close to 0 4 the result is consistent with cui s study besides the η e b t and the η f decrease with increasing wavelength as discussed above the changes reflect the differences between the undulation mode and the oscillation mode with increasing wavelength the pushing area gradually becomes horizontal which reduces the momentum transfer in streamwise direction and increases the energy loss in lateral direction generally the efficiency in the oscillation mode is lower than that in undulation mode cui et al 2017 thekkethil et al 2020 5 3 effects of fluid non dimensional numbers on performance the effects of kinematic factors on performance is intuitive and the one to one connection between them is clear usually however there are defects in evaluating performance based on kinematics parameters kinematics parameters rely on the size and shape of the study object even though these parameters are non dimensional for example for the fish with 1 15bl of wavelength in the present work and another fish with 1 15bl of wavelength and 10m of body length although the non dimensional wavelength is the same the swimming performance may be different under the same non dimensional kinematic conditions viscous effects may lead to a different result due to the low r e for the former besides different kinematic parameters may also lead to the similar swimming performance hence another topic is to explore the connection between the fluid structure and the swimming performance some studies smits 2019 shows that there is no obvious one to one connection between them the topic is like studying the footprints of terrestrial animals although it does not offer the complete information some interesting results can still be obtained from the fluid structure for a two dimensional unsteady incompressible fluid flow r e and s t are generally used to characterize the fluid flow the relation between r e and swimming speed u s is one to one based on the definition of r e the connection between the s t and u s is a bit complicated due to the effect of the frequency f on s t when the f is variable the u s is also variable and given by eq 30 the relation between the s t and the u s is written as 32 u s f a s t u s 1 a u s b a a s t u s b a a s t a a the formula 32 shows that s t decreases with increasing swimming speed u s and s t tends to a lower limit when u s tends to infinity as shown in fig 15 three dashed lines represent three different wavelength conditions there is always a lower limit of s t for each dashed line and it is equal to a a not depending on the frequency four solid lines represent four different frequency conditions for a fixed frequency the s t decreases with increasing wavelength the undulation mode gradually becomes the oscillation mode with increasing wavelength i e s t still has a lower limit which represents the s t of a foil under the oscillation mode the fig 15 also shows that there is not a one to one connection between the u s and the s t under different kinematic conditions the fish may obtain a similar swimming speed and the s t of fluid flow may be the same moreover the s t always decreases with the increasing frequency or the increasing wavelength and the decreasing s t always tends to a lower limit variations of thrust coefficient and lateral power coefficient with increasing r e and s t are shown in fig 16 both the thrust coefficient and the lateral power coefficient show the same trend decreasing with increasing r e the one to one connection between the coefficients and r e is obvious and clear the larger the reynolds number the larger the swimming speed and the fluid dynamic pressure in a sense the high power function of swimming speed at the denominator position plays a primary role in the non dimensionalization process of force and power causing the same results in other words the static pressure on the fish body is much smaller than the dynamic pressure the fluid field need more energy from the fish motion to maintain the high r e fluid flow for the fish there are much more momentum transfer in lateral direction not in streamwise direction therefore the flow of high reynolds number is not benefit for the fish swimming from the energy standpoint besides there is not an one to one connection between the coefficients and s t as shown in fig 16 c and d generally speaking the thrust and lateral power coefficients increase with increasing s t the s t is used to describe the oscillating wake mechanism the higher s t the more strongly the wake flow the thrust generation of the fish also depends on the reverse kármán vortex street the strong wake means the more momentum transfer in streamwise direction leading to the larger thrust as a result a high efficiency propulsion for the fish requires a high s t and a low r e as shown in fig 17 the difference value between the maximum value and the minimum value does not exceed 0 1 under different undulation conditions the froude efficiency is always higher than 0 5 in all cases the figure also confirms the conclusion that is a necessary condition for high efficient propulsion is to maintain a swimming state with a low reynolds number and a high strouhal number 5 4 performance optimization swimming efficiency is widely used as an optimization goal however there are some tricky problems in the optimization process firstly the definition of swimming efficiency is not unique it need be further explored whether the optimization result changes with the definition of efficiency secondly the efficiency indexes defined in section 3 2 can only represent hydrodynamic efficiency not system efficiency the hydrodynamic efficiency cannot measure the loss of mechanical energy or muscle energy for the whole system lastly high swimming efficiency does not means high swimming speed any optimization could conclude that a swimming speed of zero is optimal since there is no power loss in the system a more meaningful optimization goal can be expressed as under the optimal swimming conditions the swimmer spend less energy and time on migrating at a given distance the goal demands a reasonable compromise between high efficiency and high swimming speed the optimization is defined by 33 s t 1 t 2 e t d t where e t presents the total energy consumption during swimming the t 1 and t 2 represent the start time and end time for migrating a given distance the time integral of the total energy consumption is called the action denoted by s the distance is 1000 l to simulate a long distance migration the fish is considered always under a dynamic steady state throughout swimming because the startup and accelerating process take little time compared with the whole migration process from the biological metabolism standpoint energy demanding processes of a swimming fish without feeding consist of standard metabolic rate smr and active metabolic rate amr smr is the minimum maintenance metabolism independent of swimming speed amr is the motion metabolism for maintaining a swimming speed hydrodynamic energy consumption typically accounts for 6 20 of amr the total power p t is written as 34 p t p a m r p s m r p h η 0 14 1 s m r where p h η 0 is the power consumption by the muscle to maintain a swimming speed u s the η 0 is the muscle power efficiency of the biochemical to mechanical energy conversion it is 0 15 in the model based on the liu s study liu et al 2012 the p h is written as 35 p h f t u s p s i d e the smr is usually calculated with the unit mgo 2 s 1 it can be converted into energy units by multiplying a general oxycaloric value of 14 1jmgo 2 1 steinhausen et al 2005 a general bio energetic model can predict the smr and can be written as 36 s m r a m b e c t 0 where a b and c are constants and can be obtained based on the holker s study holker 2003 the smr mgo 2 h 1 in formula 36 depends on the different species the fish mass g and the environmental temperature c in the study the environment temperature t 0 is always equal to 20 c hence the index s for the given distance 1000l is written as 37 s 0 5 f t u s p s i d e η 0 14 1 s m r 1000 l u s 2 the optimization results are shown in figs 18 and 19 the one to one connection between the index s and the r e is clear the s achieves the minimum value when the r e is about 24000 under that condition froude efficiency for the fish is about 0 52 with a 2 4bl s of swimming speed as shown in fig 19 it is benefit for decreasing the s at a low s t and a high r e the optimal s t is about 0 23 as discussed above the optimization result is a reasonable compromise between the time cost and the energy consumption it is noted that the conclusion for the s is completely opposite to the condition of high efficiency propulsion a high efficiency propulsion requires that the swimming speed is low enough as shown in fig 17 however the swimming with low speed and high efficiency spends more time on migrating the given distance the index s emphasizes time cost for the entire swimming process compared with traditional optimization goals 6 conclusions this study aims to evaluate and optimize propulsion performance of fish like propulsion a comprehensive hydrodynamic study involving self propulsion models transient hydrodynamics performance evaluation and optimization are presented effects of the wavelength and the frequency on swimming performance are discussed the effects of kinematic factors on performance is intuitive and the one to one connection between them is clear usually however there are defects in evaluating performance based on kinematics parameters the kinematics parameters cannot reflect the effects from fluid viscosity and wake structure further r e and s t are used to characterize the fluid flow effects of them on swimming performance are also discussed in detail finally an optimization index emphasizing the time cost for the entire swimming process is proposed to be specific the conclusions drawn from the present study are as follows 1 for a self propulsion swimming fish the whole accelerating cruising process can be divided into three stages including the startup stage the acceleration stage and the dynamic steady stage the startup stage is accompanied by the formation of two dipoles in the first two cycles the wake flow gradually presents a regular staggered vortex arrangement in the acceleration stage in the dynamic steady stage the hydrodynamic and propulsive performance presented the period characteristics the propulsion process is always similar for swimming even under different motion conditions although a wide range of swimming conditions is considered the strouhal number under the dynamic steady state is always concentrated on the range form 0 2 to 0 35 2 three different efficiency indexes are discussed under different frequency and wavelength conditions ebt efficiency and froude efficiency are intuitive measures of hydrodynamic efficiency but quasi propulsive efficiency can only be used to minimize the energy consumption ebt efficiency is usually higher than froude efficiency because elongated body theory is an inviscid flow theory and underestimates the lateral power loss the calculation of quasi propulsive efficiency uses towed drag instead of undulation drag so that it underestimates the power output 3 the swimming speed is almost linear with the frequency increasing with increasing frequency the average thrust coefficient and the average lateral power coefficient both decrease monotonously with increasing frequency besides the theory demonstration based on ebt and complex function shows that the propulsion efficiency is independent of the frequency when the frequency is large enough the simulation results show that the efficiency is largely unaffected by the frequency when the frequency is larger than 1hz 4 with increasing wavelength the undulation mode gradually becomes the oscillation mode the wall vortex attached to the fish body is elongated and the pressure difference between the two sides of the fish is larger as the wavelength increases due to the greater pushing area between the tail and water as a result the swimming speed increase monotonously while the average thrust coefficient and the average lateral power coefficient both decrease monotonously with increasing wavelength the variation trend gradually flattens and performance metrics tend to limit values the limit state reflects a pure oscillating motion of a foil 5 the relations between propulsion performance and fluid field non dimensional numbers are also discussed the s t decreases with increasing swimming speed u s and s t tends to a lower limit when u s tends to infinity the thrust coefficient and the lateral power coefficient are decreased with increasing r e in other words the static pressure on the fish body is much smaller than the dynamic pressure at high r e fluid field for the fish there are much more momentum transfer in lateral direction the higher s t the more strongly the wake flow the strong wake means the more momentum transfer in streamwise direction leading to the larger thrust the simulation results show that a high efficiency propulsion for the fish requires a high s t and a low r e 6 an optimization index that emphasizes time cost for the entire swimming process is proposed to optimize the swimming for migrating a given distance under the optimal condition froude efficiency for the fish like undulation is about 0 52 with a 2 4bl s of dynamic steady state speed the

paradox proposed by gray 1936 nearly ninety years ago the studies on swimming mechanism have continued steadily since then fish have shown stronger stability greater maneuverability and higher propulsive efficiency than modern man made underwater vehicles hence the research field has attracted considerable attention in the past half century since lighthill proposed the slender body theory ebt lighthill 1960 1970 the study for bcf propulsion has been an important topic in the literature bcf body and or caudal fin propulsion is the swimming mode adopted about 85 of the fish species the bcf fish generate thrust relying on the lateral undulation of the body and caudal fin the mode is considered to have great advantages of high speed and high swimming efficiency for fish swimming compared with mpf median and or paired fin propulsion mode scaradozzi et al 2017 fuller understanding to fish swimming mechanisms could make it easier to guide and develop high performance underwater robots salazar et al 2018 sahoo et al 2019 the bulk of recent works in the field is concerned with computational fluid dynamics cfd with the advancements in computer techniques lamas and vidal 2020 reviewed the state of the works in the field of biomimetic hydrodynamics and numerical techniques over the past decades cfd technique provides important information of fluid field avoiding limitations of experimental conditions for the study of fish propulsion maertens et al 2017 verma et al 2018 feng et al 2020 some studies are conducted based on two dimensional hydrodynamic simulations that require less computational resources and time costs meanwhile two dimensional simulations could still provide some useful insights for understanding fish swimming mechanism xiao et al 2011 presented a numerical study on the hydrodynamic performance of undulation foil in the near wake of d section cylinder li et al 2019 reported that the wake and the pressure resulting from the undulating fish are important factors affecting the froude efficiency based on the study of fish swarm the results showed that fish group could choose different swarm configuration to adapt to the environment and tasks sun et al 2020 reported that the energy extraction efficiency of the undulatory airfoil with a thicker leading edge becomes higher at moderate to high reynolds numbers they found that the propulsive performance can be considerably affected by the leading edge radius at only low and moderate reynolds numbers besides some studies also explored the collective behaviors and passive hydrodynamic interactions in different schooling arrangements based on two dimensional fish like models khalid et al 2018 dai et al 2018 park and sung 2018 li et al 2019 through using numerical simulations it provides an understanding to evaluate the hydrodynamic performance and explore the wake characteristics of fish swimming interesting to note that the swimming efficiency of fish involved in above numerical studies are generally less than 0 5 the result does not reflect the advantages of fish swimming compared to man made underwater vehicles most of these studies used tethered methods to simulate the fish swimming where the velocity of the fish are considered constant irrespective of the hydrodynamic forces the method is widely used to simulate a constant velocity propulsion dong and lu 2007 liu et al 2012 thekkethil et al 2017 zhao and dou 2019 however the motion of the fish is usually transient where swimming velocity varies with changes of undulation profiles thus for exploring transient characteristics of fish and flow fluid a self propulsion study is necessary where the swimming velocity and acceleration rely on net thrust at any moment self propulsion studies have been undertaken to evaluate swimming performance and explore optimal swimming mode zhu et al 2014 conducted a systematic parametric study to investigate the effects of flexibility on hydrodynamic performance quantities such as the cruising speed swimming power and efficiency they presented that moderate flexibility is beneficial to symmetry preservation in the wake while excessive flexibility can trigger symmetry breaking cui et al 2017 reported that the forward speed of the fish is closely related to the tail beat frequency while the swimming efficiency is increased with the tail beat frequency and amplitude coefficient thekkethil et al 2020 used a unified kinematics model to study propulsion characteristics of different types bcf fish like self propulsion they found that the smaller wavelength for undulation motion is more effective over this smaller ranger of propulsion velocity table 1 shows a study summary involving some two dimensional numerical studies based on the fish like propulsion the table shows the numerical method the type of propulsion systems the kinematics and two fluid non dimensional numbers adopted in the corresponding study although a number of studies have discussed swimming performance and fluid field characteristics for undulation motion at different conditions there are still academic controversial points on the undulation mechanism due to lack of reliable experimental results for undulation wavelength some studies showed that there is an optimal specific wavelength that maximizes the swimming speed and the thrust force for an undulatory swimmer bale et al 2015 nangia et al 2017 however thekkethil et al 2017 presented that mean thrust coefficient of the undulating foil increases with increasing wavelength for propulsive efficiency the definition of efficiency has not yet been unified quasi propulsive efficiency cui et al 2017 maertens et al 2015 froude efficiency borazjani and sotiropoulos 2008 sun et al 2020 and net propulsive efficiency thekkethil et al 2018 zhao and dou 2019 are widely used to evaluation the swimming performance of fish like propulsion no studies reveal differences among the different efficiency indexes for swimming performance optimization cui et al 2017 presented that the swimming efficiency is increased with the tail beat frequency generally the swimming speed also increases with increasing frequency the result that efficiency and swimming speed are increased with the undulation frequency is not in line with experiment results tytell and lauder 2004 it is still an open question that whether there is an optimal kinematic profile for the undulation mode in order to obtain optimal hydrodynamic performance these intriguing problems will be further investigated in this work a systematic study is still necessary to fully understand the hydrodynamic performance of the fish like propulsion in the work a more comprehensive study on performance evaluation and optimization for fish like propulsion is presented transient and dynamic steady propulsion performance are discussed based on a unified kinematic model and different self propulsion undulation conditions a new optimization index that emphasizes time cost for the entire swimming process is proposed the rest of the paper is organized as follows in section 2 geometry and kinematic models for fish like propulsion are built in section 3 some metrics are discussed to evaluate propulsion performance in section 4 cfd numerical methods and error estimation are described in section 5 numerical results are presented and discussed in detail effects of kinematic factors and fluid non dimensional numbers on performance are discussed an optimization goal function is proposed to explore the optimal swimming performance in section 6 some conclusions are drawn 2 kinematic model the present study of fish like propulsion is based on a two dimensional kinematic model the model was used to simulate subcarangiform fish swimming such as rainbow trout liu et al 1997 xiao et al 2011 the fish like object like a rainbow trout is abbreviated as fish for convenience in the work the model is adopted to model the undulation motion of fish centerline the lateral displacement equation of the centerline is used as follows 1 h x t a x sin 2 π x λ t t where l is the fish centerline length and always equal to 0 1m in the study the variable t represents the time x is the streamwise coordinate measured from the tip of fish head t is the undulation period λ is the undulation wavelength and a x is the lateral amplitude of undulation and described as follows 2 a x l 0 351 sin x l 1 796 0 359 the centerline motion can be calculated by formulas 1 and 2 as shown in fig 1 the maximum undulation amplitude a x m a x is about 0 1 l in addition naca foil is widely used to model the fish body to add thickness to the fish centerline a fourth order naca0012 foil equation is used as follows 3 d s t m a x 0 2 0 2969 s l 0 1260 s l 0 3516 s l 2 0 2843 s l 3 0 1015 s l 4 where d s is the distance of the fish outline normal to and away from the fish centerline at position s and t m a x is the maximum thickness and equal to 0 125 l as shown in fig 2 in the study newton raphson method is used to update positions of centerline and keep the total length constant the method prevents the fish centerline from being stretched or compressed throughout motion the fish outline is obtained based on the foil equation it is a widely used method to simulate fish undulation by using foil undulation however there are still some differences between the fish and the foil for example the head of the foil has a smaller curvature radius at the nose liao et al 2003 it is to be expected that simulation results will not precisely match that of a real rainbow trout the motion of fish body modeled by the foil is shown in fig 3 3 performance metrics in the study all performance metrics are related to speed of fish propulsion fish propulsion is intermittent in nature where the speed is time wise varying with unsteady flow fish are usually under a dynamic steady state to maintain low energy consumption where the net thrust is almost zero and swimming speed shows the periodic fluctuation of small amplitude the average streamwise swimming speed of fish under a dynamic steady state is abbreviated as swimming speed u s for convenience all metrics below also aim to evaluate performance of fish under a dynamic steady state 3 1 ebt efficiency efficiency η is used to measure the energy conversion and loss throughout swimming in the study three different efficiency metrics are used to evaluate the self propulsion state of fish swimming the differences among the efficiency metrics are also discussed elongated body theory ebt developed by lighthill 1960 is an inviscid flow theory to evaluate force and efficiency for a slender fish the theory is widely used to predict swimming performance for a fish like motion although it has proven to have some defects such as overestimating efficiency and ignoring effects of wake vortices however it can still be considered as a performance index due to the low cost of calculation in ebt the time averaged thrust power efficiency are 4 t e b t p e b t u s 1 2 ρ h t u s h x 2 ζ p e b t ρ u s ζ h t u s h x h t η e b t t e b t u s p e b t where ζ is the area of the circumscribing circle of the cross section defined in ebt ρ ζ is the virtual mass ζ π 4 in 2d u s is the swimming speed elongated body theory cannot predict the u s so that the speed u s depends on numerical calculation in the study other values are calculated at the trailing edge x l by using complex functions the lateral displacement h x t can also be written as 5 h x t a x cos 2 π x λ t t π 2 re a x e 2 π x λ 2 π t t π 2 i re a x e i ω t where the symbol re represents the real part of the complex function the complex function h x the complex function a x and the angular frequency ω are respectively 6 h x t a x e i ω t a x a x e 2 π x λ π 2 i ω 2 π t partial derivatives for the h x t are 7 h t i ω a x e i ω t h x a x e i ω t the amplitude a 0 resp a 0 of the complex number a l resp a l is defined as 8 a l a 0 e i θ a l a 0 e i α using these complex functions the η e b t is also written as 9 η e b t 1 2 x 1 x x sin δ where the variables x and δ are respectively 10 x ω a 0 u s a 0 δ α θ the detailed derivation process can be referred to maertens s study maertens et al 2015 the efficiency calculation is more complicated using complex functions but the relation between kinematics parameters is more clear which is useful for the work 3 2 froude efficiency froude propulsive efficiency tytell and lauder 2004 is a measure of hydrodynamic efficiency which does not take into account additional mechanical energy loss of a system it is only useful in a dynamic steady state and not in acceleration motion it is defined as the ratio of useful power output to total power and written as 11 η f useful power total power f t u s f t u s p s i d e where f t and p s i d e represent average thrust and average power loss over a swimming cycle thrust need to be calculated to obtain froude propulsive efficiency under the dynamic steady state however the state means thrust is approximately equal to drag so that the net thrust f x is almost equal to zero it is more challenging to make the distinction between thrust and drag it is still possible but there is no simple theoretical method to make the distinction borazjani and sotiropoulos 2008 proposed a numerical method to achieve the distinction based on effects of forces net thrust f x can be defined as 12 f x t σ p n x τ x i n i d s i x y z where n i is the i th direction component of unit normal on element face d s τ is viscous stress tensor the subscript x indicates x axis direction and σ represents the whole fish outline net thrust f x t could contribute to either drag f d t or thrust f t t depending on whether f x t is negative or positive thus f x t is also written as 13 f x t f t t f d t to separate the two contributions thrust f t t and drag f d t are defined as follows 14 f t t f t p f t ν 1 2 σ p n x d s σ p n x d s 1 2 σ τ x i n i d s σ τ x i n i d s 15 f d t f d p f d ν 1 2 σ p n x d s σ p n x d s 1 2 σ τ x i n i d s σ τ x i n i d s power loss induced by lateral displacement is given by 16 p s i d e σ p n y u y d s σ τ y i n i u y d s where u y is the lateral undulation velocity from the time derivative of the lateral displacement 3 3 quasi propulsive efficiency quasi propulsive efficiency is considered a new rational non dimensional index of propulsive fitness of fish and fish like mechanisms maertens et al 2015 for a self propulsion fish the quasi propulsive efficiency is defined as follows 17 η q p r u s p i n where u s is swimming speed and r is towed drag and is obtained by towing a fish body without bending at the speed u s power input p i n is estimated as follows 18 p i n σ u f f d s where u f is local velocity on the fish body and f is local hydrodynamic force on the fish body under the two dimensional dynamic steady state the formula 18 can be further simplified as 19 p i n σ u x f x u y f y d s σ u s f x d s p s i d e u s f x p s i d e the average value of net thrust f x is almost equal to zero under a dynamic steady state thus the average value of power input p i n is also written as 20 p i n p s i d e the advantage of quasi propulsive efficiency is that it avoids the distinction between thrust and drag the towed drag r can also capture the hydrodynamic features of hulls so that it can be used to compared the performance of different vehicles maertens et al 2015 3 4 non dimensional coefficients the following non dimensional coefficients are used to characterize self propulsion motion of fish these non dimensional force coefficients and fluid non dimensional numbers are defined as follows reynolds number r e is the ratio of the inertial forces to the viscous forces and written by 21 r e u s l ν where u s is the swimming speed of fish l is the length of fish centerline and ν is the kinematic viscosity of water strouhal number s t s a non dimensional number describing oscillating flow mechanisms it is given as 22 s t f a p u s where f is the undulatory frequency of fish a p is the maximum peak to peak amplitude of lateral undulation and u s is the swimming speed of fish force coefficients are also discussed to characterize the self propulsion motion these coefficients are defined as 23 c f f x 0 5 ρ u s 2 l c t f t 0 5 ρ u s 2 l c d f d 0 5 ρ u s 2 l c p p s i d e 0 5 ρ u s 3 l where c f is net thrust force coefficient c t is thrust coefficient c d are drag coefficient and c p is lateral power loss coefficient when a fish is under a dynamic steady state its net thrust is almost equal to zero as a result c f is also equal to zero and c t is close to c d 4 method and verification 4 1 numerical method most performance metrics discussed above cannot be directly calculated from existing theoretical models therefore the study of performance evaluation is mainly depended on the numerical method for fluid system a self propulsion fish like motion into an incompressible viscous fluid is focused in the work governing equations for fluid flow are the two dimensional unsteady incompressible navier stokes equations in addition the computational domain contains a two dimensional flexible deforming fish body the dynamic mesh model is also applied to model flows where the computational domain is changing with the flexible motion with respect to dynamic meshes the governing equations solved are written as 24 u u g 0 t ρ u ρ u u u g p μ 2 u where u is the flow velocity u g is the mesh velocity of the moving mesh ρ is the fluid density p is the pressure and μ is dynamic viscosity the whole fluid system is simulated based on the cfd software ansys fluent a no slip boundary condition is applied to the deforming fish body 25 u u f where u f is local velocity on the fish body in this work the 1 dof self propulsion motion is focused and the fish is only able to do undulatory motion periodically and swim along the streamwise direction thus the velocity u f can be decomposed into two parts 26 u f u s u d e f where u s is local swimming velocity on the fish body along streamwise direction u d e f is the local deforming velocity on the fish body the deforming velocity u d e f is only depended on the undulatory motion defined in eq 1 the undulatory motion is a prescribed motion which is presented in section 2 the fish swimming is an unprescribed motion where the subsequent swimming velocity is depended on the net thrust at current time the self propulsion swimming velocity u s can be calculated by newton s law 27 f x m d u s d t where f x is the net thrust defined in eq 12 and u s is the instant swimming speed the fish mass m is a constant and equal to 1kg for convenience in the study fluent allows users to describe the complex deforming motion and control the positions of boundaries using user defined functions udfs the self propulsion swimming speed is calculated based on the definitions above at each time step besides the prescribed undulation motion is used to control fish body deformation the calculation processes are coded as a macro function and linked to fluent the macro function is executed at every time step to control the fish motion the fluid computational domain zone 1 is a rectangular zone which is meshed with structured meshes zone 2 which contains the fish is meshed with triangular unstructured meshes the two zones are independent and overlapping connected by an overset interface the interface connects different cell zones by interpolating cell data in the overlapping regions the computational domain is shown in fig 4 as the background mesh the meshes in zone 1 is always static and does not involve the mesh motion mesh deformation motion is concentrated in zone 2 affected by flexible deformation of fish body some meshes that do not meet the quality requirements in the zone 2 are marked based the size and skewness criteria the new positions of these meshes are updated based on the spring smoothing and remeshing methods at each time step throughout the simulation the swimming speed u s obtained from calculation is not directly given the fish but the whole zone 2 at every time step the whole zone 2 moves forward at the speed u s the meshes in zone 2 and the fish boundary are given a forward speed as a result the fish body boundary get a undulation speed from a prescribed motion and a forward speed from calculation as described in eq 26 the meshes in zone 2 also seem to get a forward speed however it does not affect the simulation because the boundary motion conditions are not affected by these meshes an advantage of overset technique is that component mesh and background mesh can be generated separately with fewer constrains more importantly zone 1 does not require dynamic mesh models and mesh deformation so that simulation time cost can be reduced compared with controlling the skewness of the deforming meshes in a larger computational domain it is easier to control deforming sizes of local meshes on zone 2 the adoption of overset technique is a compromise between time cost and simulation accuracy local region zone 2 near the fish are filled with unstructured meshes to ensure mesh quality throughout deforming motion and the background mesh are filled with structured meshes to reduce the time cost of calculating the fluid field away from the fish in mesh overlap areas receptor cells and donor cells are given nearly identical resolutions avoiding to generate orphan cells and leading to better solution accuracy when an overset interface is set as shown in fig 4 three main steps need to be completed namely hole cutting overlap minimization and donor search ansys inc 2020 the process called hole cutting marks cells lying outside of flow region as dead cells overlap minimization is used to minimize lapping regions by converting unnecessary solve cells into receptor cells and converting unnecessary receptor cells into dead cells in the process called donor search ansys fluent automatically searched valid solve meshes for each receptor mesh and the solve meshes are used as donor candidates to establishing the connectivity between two zones after these steps are completed the interpolation can be performed to transfer information from donor meshes to receptor meshes throughout the simulation in the work the least square interpolation method is used to interpolate cell data in the overlapping regions other boundary conditions are also marked in fig 4 the left boundary is set to velocity inlet boundary the velocity of the inlet boundary is zero and the fish mainly rely on the own undulation to swim forward the right boundary is set to pressure outlet boundary the upper and lower sides of the fluid domain is set to wall boundary the local meshes near the fish body is refined to ensure high boundary mesh resolution the computational flow field presents laminar flow characteristics because swimming speeds of fish do not exceed 4 5 bl s body lengths per second in the study the fish length is 0 1m so that the maximum r e of the external flow field does not exceed 45 000 a double precision solver is used to solve the transient laminar fluid model based on the pressure based coupled algorithm all discrete formats of space and time are second order in order to ensure calculation accuracy 4 2 discretization error estimation error estimation is necessary to ensure a high reliability for cfd study there are generally three contributions to the numerical error round off error iterative error and discretization error in principle the round off error can be decreased and ignored by using a double precision solver the iterative error is also decreased with increasing machine accuracy as a result the discretization error is usually the main contributor to the numerical error eça and hoekstra 2013 in the study a discretization error estimation is executed by calculating a numerical uncertainty based on grid refinement the method proposed by eça and hoekstra 2014 builds error estimators and uses least square method to estimate the discretization error even if the exact solution is unknown a qualitative dependency study is first carried out in order to find a study scope of mesh and time step a case with 5hz of undulation frequency is used different grids are used which consist of m 1 99 645 cells m 2 171 803 cells m 3 245 594 cells and m 4 309 751 cells to study mesh dependency different time step sizes are used which consist of δ t 1 1 200 t δ t 2 1 266 t δ t 3 1 400 t and δ t 4 1 800 t to study time dependence the results are shown in fig 5 differences among these results are subtle and the four grids with the same time step 1 400 t are used to do the error estimation the discretization error estimation aims to estimate the uncertainty of a given numerical result even if the exact solution is unknown the basic formula is given 28 ϕ e x a c t ϕ i λ ϕ where ϕ is any flow quantity ϕ e x a c t is the exact solution of the quantity ϕ i is the numerical solution of the quantity λ ϕ is the estimated uncertainty the basic equation to estimate the discretization error ϵ ϕ is 29 ϵ ϕ ϕ i ϕ 0 α h i p 0 where ϕ 0 is the estimate of the exact solution α is a constant to be determined h i is the typical cell size and p 0 is the observed order of grid convergence usually p 0 is equal to the theoretical order of numerical method thus p 0 is equal to 2 in the work it is possible to determine these unknown quantities based on the least square method and power series expansions the estimation scheme used in the work is the weighted two term expansion with second order terms here main steps are omitted and a detailed description of the error estimation is given in eca s study eça and hoekstra 2014 the swimming speed u s and the drag coefficient c d are selected as estimation objects the estimation results are given in table 2 the four simulation cases are carried out with the same time step 1 400 t for the estimated uncertainty of the speed low density mesh get a better result conversely high density mesh get a better result for the estimated uncertainty of the drag coefficient which is expected as a compromise between time cost and calculation accuracy the grid m 3 within an acceptable error range is adopted in the work 5 performance evaluation and optimization 5 1 simulation results the work focus on the effects of undulation frequency and wavelength on propulsion performance wavelength and frequency are two study variables other parameters are considered constants fig 6 presents the range of the frequency and the wavelength applied in the work wavelength is measured by the body length of the fish bl each colorful spot represents a simulation case carried out in the work in fig 6 a the colorful bar represents the range of reynolds number under the dynamic steady state in general reynolds number increases with increasing frequency and wavelength while strouhal number decreases with increasing frequency and wavelength as shown in fig 6 b although a wide range of swimming conditions is considered the strouhal number under the dynamic steady state is concentrated on the range form 0 25 to 0 35 it is also found that a wide variety of fishes swim within the range of s t from 0 2 to 0 35 triantafyllou et al 1993 taylor et al 2003 smits 2019 the undulation shapes at different wavelengths are shown in fig 7 the higher the frequency the faster the undulation speed but the undulation shape is the same with increasing wavelength the undulation mode gradually becomes the oscillation mode the pressure suction based thrust generation mechanism can be applied to the undulation mode müller et al 1997 while thrust in oscillating motion is generated by the formation of low and high pressure regions another feature is that the wall vortex attached to the fish body is elongated as the wavelength increases as shown by the black streamline in fig 7 the pressure difference between the two sides of the fish is larger as the wavelength increases due to the greater pushing area between the tail and water with increasing wavelength the pushing area gradually becomes horizontal which reduces the momentum transfer in streamwise direction and increases the energy loss in lateral direction thekkethil et al 2017 although the different kinematic parameters lead to the different performance the self propulsion process form a static state to a dynamic steady state for fish swimming is similar even under different motion conditions the static accelerating cruising process of the fish is shown in fig 9 based on vorticity contours throughout the whole process the temporal variations of the fish swimming speed are shown in fig 10 a the accelerating cruising process can be roughly divided into three stages the first stage is the startup stage which corresponds to the first and second swimming cycle the acceleration of the fish in the start stage reaches the maximum value with the generation of starting vortices the starting vortices including a clockwise vortex and a counter clockwise vortex are generated at the leading edge and fall off at the trailing edge one after another due to a undulation pressure difference between the left and right sides as shown in fig 8 two vortices form a dipole due to the almost static flow field and the little convection of momentum transfer the dipole also promotes the formation of local jets thereby further increasing the thrust during the startup process the startup process is accompanied by the formation of two dipoles the dipoles are also shown in the vorticity contour in fig 8 the dipole formation is absent in the third cycle due to the increase of wake velocity the phenomena have also been discussed in depth in some past studies marais et al 2012 thekkethil et al 2020 the second stage is the acceleration process the wake flow generally presents a regular staggered vortex arrangement as shown in the vorticity contour at 6 0 t and 8 5 t the swimming speed increases gradually and smoothly but the acceleration decreases due to the increasing drag during the process as shown in fig 10 a the entire fluid system gradually develop to a dynamic steady state some force coefficients defined in formula 23 are shown in fig 10 the figures do not show the coefficient variations of the startup stage because the swimming speed at this stage is so small that the coefficients is very large after nondimensionalization the third stage is the dynamic steady state the swimming speed tends to a steady value with zero of net thrust force the final average value of the coefficient c f is zero as shown in fig 10 b fig 10 c and d show the temporal variations of c t and c p and they are all decreasing and eventually reach steady values under the dynamic steady state the coefficients under different swimming conditions shows the similar variation trend 5 2 effects of kinematic factors on performance the effects of different frequencies and wavelengths on the performance are reflected in the changes of the coefficients the results are summarized in fig 11 fig 11 a shows the variations of swimming speed with increasing frequency the swimming speed is linear with the frequency increasing with increasing frequency the average thrust coefficient and the average lateral power coefficient both decrease monotonously with increasing frequency as shown in fig 11 c and e and the lower the frequency the greater the gradient it is noted that thrust and lateral power loss increase with increasing frequency as shown in fig 10 the trends of force and force coefficient are opposite from the mathematics standpoint the high power function of speed at the denominator position plays a primary role in the non dimensionalization process causing the decrease of coefficients instead for different wavelengths the speed increase monotonously while the average thrust coefficient and the average lateral power coefficient both decrease monotonously with increasing wavelength as shown in fig 11 b d and f compared with the frequency the changes are slight as the wavelength increases the variation trend gradually flattens and performance metrics tend to limit values from the kinematic standpoint the limit state reflects a pure oscillating motion of a foil as discussed in section 5 1 the undulation mode gradually becomes the oscillation mode and the undulatory fish gradually becomes an oscillating foil with increasing wavelength the changes of metrics reflect the difference between the undulation mode and the oscillation mode when the wavelength is relatively small undulation mode the thrust generation depend on the pushing area the pushing area gradually becomes horizontal as the wavelength increases as a result thrust generation is gradually independent on the wavelength and dependent on the low and high pressure regions which are related to the body shape thekkethil et al 2017 the variations of the three efficiency under different kinematic conditions are shown in fig 13 the three different efficiencies are widely used in hydrodynamic performance evaluation quasi propulsive efficiency also depends on towed drag r which is obtained by towing a fish body without bending at a constant velocity as shown in fig 12 the towed drag at other different towed velocity can be obtained by interpolation based on the results the swimming efficiency ranges from 0 4 to 0 8 under different undulation conditions the η e b t is higher than the η f while the η q p is generally lower in essence elongated body theory is an inviscid flow theory and does not take account into viscous shear stress so that it underestimates the lateral power loss and overestimates the swimming efficiency the η f relies on the estimation for thrust produced by a swimming fish it is difficult to separate the thrust from the net thrust usually the separation method is completely numerical and has no clear physical significance the disadvantage of the η q p is that it is not strictly an efficiency hence its range is not strictly 0 to 1 the calculation of the η q p actually uses towed drag instead of undulation drag during swimming undulation drag is equal to thrust at a dynamic steady state hence the η q p underestimates the thrust and the swimming efficiency in short ebt efficiency and froude efficiency are intuitive measures of hydrodynamic efficiency but quasi propulsive efficiency can only be used to minimize the energy consumption maertens et al 2015 it should be noted that the η e b t and the η f remain almost constant with increasing frequency it shows that frequency has no effect on efficiency the frequency is always related to the swimming speed in a dynamic steady state the swimming speed u s is linear with the frequency f hence the u s can be approximately expressed as 30 u s a f b where the a and b are constants an intuitive fact is that the swimming speed should be zero when the frequency is zero hence the b should be equal to zero however when b is 0 a paradox arises here the s t is always a constant due to f a u s a a the conclusion is inconsistent with both experiment study and simulation study the relations between the speed and the frequency at different wavelengths are further shown in fig 14 the linear relation under different wavelengths always works however a and b vary with the wavelength the results of curve fitting show that the range of the b is between 0 to 1 i e b is a small number but not zero the linear relation also reported in webb s experiment study webb et al 1984 when the frequency is large enough the b can be ignored and the u s is approximately proportional to the f by taking the results into formula 10 x can be written as 31 x 2 π f a 0 u s a 0 2 π f a 0 a f b a 0 2 π a 0 a a 0 an advantage of introducing complex function into ebt is that it can separate variables from a coupling equation 4 the complex function a x is independent on frequency according to the definition eq 6 thus a 0 a 0 and δ derived from a x are independent on frequency hence when the frequency is large enough x and η e b t is also independent on frequency according to formula 9 although the conclusion is derived from ebt it can also apply to froude efficiency η f as shown in fig 13 this is an empirical inference because ebt efficiency and froude efficiency are both intuitive measures of hydrodynamic efficiency it does not work for quasi propulsive efficiency η q p because η q p depends on not only the swimming motion but also the towed process besides the conclusion is based on the linear relation between the swimming speed and the frequency under the dynamic steady state the conclusion does not work when the fish is at the startup or accelerating state another limitation is that the frequency is required large enough in fact when the f is larger than 1hz the efficiency is largely unaffected by the frequency for the wavelength the quasi propulsive efficiency does not show a significant difference under different wavelength conditions as shown in fig 11 b the η q p always remains close to 0 4 the result is consistent with cui s study besides the η e b t and the η f decrease with increasing wavelength as discussed above the changes reflect the differences between the undulation mode and the oscillation mode with increasing wavelength the pushing area gradually becomes horizontal which reduces the momentum transfer in streamwise direction and increases the energy loss in lateral direction generally the efficiency in the oscillation mode is lower than that in undulation mode cui et al 2017 thekkethil et al 2020 5 3 effects of fluid non dimensional numbers on performance the effects of kinematic factors on performance is intuitive and the one to one connection between them is clear usually however there are defects in evaluating performance based on kinematics parameters kinematics parameters rely on the size and shape of the study object even though these parameters are non dimensional for example for the fish with 1 15bl of wavelength in the present work and another fish with 1 15bl of wavelength and 10m of body length although the non dimensional wavelength is the same the swimming performance may be different under the same non dimensional kinematic conditions viscous effects may lead to a different result due to the low r e for the former besides different kinematic parameters may also lead to the similar swimming performance hence another topic is to explore the connection between the fluid structure and the swimming performance some studies smits 2019 shows that there is no obvious one to one connection between them the topic is like studying the footprints of terrestrial animals although it does not offer the complete information some interesting results can still be obtained from the fluid structure for a two dimensional unsteady incompressible fluid flow r e and s t are generally used to characterize the fluid flow the relation between r e and swimming speed u s is one to one based on the definition of r e the connection between the s t and u s is a bit complicated due to the effect of the frequency f on s t when the f is variable the u s is also variable and given by eq 30 the relation between the s t and the u s is written as 32 u s f a s t u s 1 a u s b a a s t u s b a a s t a a the formula 32 shows that s t decreases with increasing swimming speed u s and s t tends to a lower limit when u s tends to infinity as shown in fig 15 three dashed lines represent three different wavelength conditions there is always a lower limit of s t for each dashed line and it is equal to a a not depending on the frequency four solid lines represent four different frequency conditions for a fixed frequency the s t decreases with increasing wavelength the undulation mode gradually becomes the oscillation mode with increasing wavelength i e s t still has a lower limit which represents the s t of a foil under the oscillation mode the fig 15 also shows that there is not a one to one connection between the u s and the s t under different kinematic conditions the fish may obtain a similar swimming speed and the s t of fluid flow may be the same moreover the s t always decreases with the increasing frequency or the increasing wavelength and the decreasing s t always tends to a lower limit variations of thrust coefficient and lateral power coefficient with increasing r e and s t are shown in fig 16 both the thrust coefficient and the lateral power coefficient show the same trend decreasing with increasing r e the one to one connection between the coefficients and r e is obvious and clear the larger the reynolds number the larger the swimming speed and the fluid dynamic pressure in a sense the high power function of swimming speed at the denominator position plays a primary role in the non dimensionalization process of force and power causing the same results in other words the static pressure on the fish body is much smaller than the dynamic pressure the fluid field need more energy from the fish motion to maintain the high r e fluid flow for the fish there are much more momentum transfer in lateral direction not in streamwise direction therefore the flow of high reynolds number is not benefit for the fish swimming from the energy standpoint besides there is not an one to one connection between the coefficients and s t as shown in fig 16 c and d generally speaking the thrust and lateral power coefficients increase with increasing s t the s t is used to describe the oscillating wake mechanism the higher s t the more strongly the wake flow the thrust generation of the fish also depends on the reverse kármán vortex street the strong wake means the more momentum transfer in streamwise direction leading to the larger thrust as a result a high efficiency propulsion for the fish requires a high s t and a low r e as shown in fig 17 the difference value between the maximum value and the minimum value does not exceed 0 1 under different undulation conditions the froude efficiency is always higher than 0 5 in all cases the figure also confirms the conclusion that is a necessary condition for high efficient propulsion is to maintain a swimming state with a low reynolds number and a high strouhal number 5 4 performance optimization swimming efficiency is widely used as an optimization goal however there are some tricky problems in the optimization process firstly the definition of swimming efficiency is not unique it need be further explored whether the optimization result changes with the definition of efficiency secondly the efficiency indexes defined in section 3 2 can only represent hydrodynamic efficiency not system efficiency the hydrodynamic efficiency cannot measure the loss of mechanical energy or muscle energy for the whole system lastly high swimming efficiency does not means high swimming speed any optimization could conclude that a swimming speed of zero is optimal since there is no power loss in the system a more meaningful optimization goal can be expressed as under the optimal swimming conditions the swimmer spend less energy and time on migrating at a given distance the goal demands a reasonable compromise between high efficiency and high swimming speed the optimization is defined by 33 s t 1 t 2 e t d t where e t presents the total energy consumption during swimming the t 1 and t 2 represent the start time and end time for migrating a given distance the time integral of the total energy consumption is called the action denoted by s the distance is 1000 l to simulate a long distance migration the fish is considered always under a dynamic steady state throughout swimming because the startup and accelerating process take little time compared with the whole migration process from the biological metabolism standpoint energy demanding processes of a swimming fish without feeding consist of standard metabolic rate smr and active metabolic rate amr smr is the minimum maintenance metabolism independent of swimming speed amr is the motion metabolism for maintaining a swimming speed hydrodynamic energy consumption typically accounts for 6 20 of amr the total power p t is written as 34 p t p a m r p s m r p h η 0 14 1 s m r where p h η 0 is the power consumption by the muscle to maintain a swimming speed u s the η 0 is the muscle power efficiency of the biochemical to mechanical energy conversion it is 0 15 in the model based on the liu s study liu et al 2012 the p h is written as 35 p h f t u s p s i d e the smr is usually calculated with the unit mgo 2 s 1 it can be converted into energy units by multiplying a general oxycaloric value of 14 1jmgo 2 1 steinhausen et al 2005 a general bio energetic model can predict the smr and can be written as 36 s m r a m b e c t 0 where a b and c are constants and can be obtained based on the holker s study holker 2003 the smr mgo 2 h 1 in formula 36 depends on the different species the fish mass g and the environmental temperature c in the study the environment temperature t 0 is always equal to 20 c hence the index s for the given distance 1000l is written as 37 s 0 5 f t u s p s i d e η 0 14 1 s m r 1000 l u s 2 the optimization results are shown in figs 18 and 19 the one to one connection between the index s and the r e is clear the s achieves the minimum value when the r e is about 24000 under that condition froude efficiency for the fish is about 0 52 with a 2 4bl s of swimming speed as shown in fig 19 it is benefit for decreasing the s at a low s t and a high r e the optimal s t is about 0 23 as discussed above the optimization result is a reasonable compromise between the time cost and the energy consumption it is noted that the conclusion for the s is completely opposite to the condition of high efficiency propulsion a high efficiency propulsion requires that the swimming speed is low enough as shown in fig 17 however the swimming with low speed and high efficiency spends more time on migrating the given distance the index s emphasizes time cost for the entire swimming process compared with traditional optimization goals 6 conclusions this study aims to evaluate and optimize propulsion performance of fish like propulsion a comprehensive hydrodynamic study involving self propulsion models transient hydrodynamics performance evaluation and optimization are presented effects of the wavelength and the frequency on swimming performance are discussed the effects of kinematic factors on performance is intuitive and the one to one connection between them is clear usually however there are defects in evaluating performance based on kinematics parameters the kinematics parameters cannot reflect the effects from fluid viscosity and wake structure further r e and s t are used to characterize the fluid flow effects of them on swimming performance are also discussed in detail finally an optimization index emphasizing the time cost for the entire swimming process is proposed to be specific the conclusions drawn from the present study are as follows 1 for a self propulsion swimming fish the whole accelerating cruising process can be divided into three stages including the startup stage the acceleration stage and the dynamic steady stage the startup stage is accompanied by the formation of two dipoles in the first two cycles the wake flow gradually presents a regular staggered vortex arrangement in the acceleration stage in the dynamic steady stage the hydrodynamic and propulsive performance presented the period characteristics the propulsion process is always similar for swimming even under different motion conditions although a wide range of swimming conditions is considered the strouhal number under the dynamic steady state is always concentrated on the range form 0 2 to 0 35 2 three different efficiency indexes are discussed under different frequency and wavelength conditions ebt efficiency and froude efficiency are intuitive measures of hydrodynamic efficiency but quasi propulsive efficiency can only be used to minimize the energy consumption ebt efficiency is usually higher than froude efficiency because elongated body theory is an inviscid flow theory and underestimates the lateral power loss the calculation of quasi propulsive efficiency uses towed drag instead of undulation drag so that it underestimates the power output 3 the swimming speed is almost linear with the frequency increasing with increasing frequency the average thrust coefficient and the average lateral power coefficient both decrease monotonously with increasing frequency besides the theory demonstration based on ebt and complex function shows that the propulsion efficiency is independent of the frequency when the frequency is large enough the simulation results show that the efficiency is largely unaffected by the frequency when the frequency is larger than 1hz 4 with increasing wavelength the undulation mode gradually becomes the oscillation mode the wall vortex attached to the fish body is elongated and the pressure difference between the two sides of the fish is larger as the wavelength increases due to the greater pushing area between the tail and water as a result the swimming speed increase monotonously while the average thrust coefficient and the average lateral power coefficient both decrease monotonously with increasing wavelength the variation trend gradually flattens and performance metrics tend to limit values the limit state reflects a pure oscillating motion of a foil 5 the relations between propulsion performance and fluid field non dimensional numbers are also discussed the s t decreases with increasing swimming speed u s and s t tends to a lower limit when u s tends to infinity the thrust coefficient and the lateral power coefficient are decreased with increasing r e in other words the static pressure on the fish body is much smaller than the dynamic pressure at high r e fluid field for the fish there are much more momentum transfer in lateral direction the higher s t the more strongly the wake flow the strong wake means the more momentum transfer in streamwise direction leading to the larger thrust the simulation results show that a high efficiency propulsion for the fish requires a high s t and a low r e 6 an optimization index that emphasizes time cost for the entire swimming process is proposed to optimize the swimming for migrating a given distance under the optimal condition froude efficiency for the fish like undulation is about 0 52 with a 2 4bl s of dynamic steady state speed the optimization result is a reasonable compromise between the time cost and the energy consumption the study offers some insights into understanding the swimming mechanism of fish like propulsion the

20641,the use of an automated net hauling system using four polyethylene pe pipes is proposed in this study to increase the efficiency of set net fishery in this system the pipes are installed on the seabed beneath a box chamber net compressed air is injected into the first pipe at the slope net and then into the other pipes in succession in this system the fish are cornered between the fourth pipe and the end of the box chamber net the performance of the system from the second to the fourth pipe is evaluated using numerical analysis water tank tests and field experiments in addition a static numerical model for the deformation of the pe pipes is developed using the theory of finite deformation and is validated by the results of the water tank and coastal sea experiments the results show that the maximal bending stress of the full scale pipe is about 10 mpa which is within the allowable range of 23 mpa indicating that the risk of pipe breakage in the automated net hauling system is considerably low therefore the automated net hauling system developed in this study has high application value and development potential in set net fishery keywords set net fishery automated net hauling system box chamber net polyethylene pipe 1 introduction set net fishery is a passive type of fishery generally applied along the paths of migrating fish at traditional sites in coastal areas less than 100 m in depth this system consists of netting devices used for herding and restraining including a leader net a panel net impounding a playground an ascending slope net a funnel net and a box chamber net hiramoto 1994 1997 1997 he and inoue 2010 wan et al 2020 the leader net extends from the entrance of the playground and is usually normal to the coastline along which the fish generally swim through the ascending slope and funnel nets fish can be herded and guided into the box chamber net where they fish are confined until harvesting wan et al 2020 set net fishery has achieved worldwide attention for its low impact on habitats and good fuel efficiency because high oil consumption for exploratory fishing is not required fish below catchable size can be released alive and intrusion and damages to fish mammals and turtles are prevented konigson et al 2013 lehtonen and suuronen 2004 2010 shen and heino 2014 suuronen et al 2012 sun et al 2006 wang and tsai 2014 net hauling operations in set net fishery require a considerable workforce for daily harvesting which is labor intensive and time consuming suuronen et al 2012 many developed countries are currently facing challenges of imminent labor shortage caused by aging populations moreover the number of fishers will decrease in the future which will cause an extended downturn in set net fishery kitazawa et al 2012 suuronen et al 2012 the development of an automated hauling system is therefore a reliable solution in the fishery industry kitazawa et al 2018 since the 1960s several complementary devices have been developed to save labor oitsuki 2004 in particular a rubber tube was considered for the design of a net hauling system in the 1980s fukahori et al 1988 decades later in the 21st century an automated hauling system using interconnected fire hoses was developed and tested kitazawa et al 2018 however this system is still under development because the durability of the fire hose connections has not been established li et al 2019 2020 a recent study conducted on the hydrodynamic performance of set net systems in water currents calculated the equilibrium configuration and the tension distribution of the set net using the finite element method and a physical model test in a flume tank wan et al 2020 however an automated net hauling system has not been considered thus far polyethylene pe pipes of suitable stiffness are newly proposed in the present study for use in an automated net hauling system fig 1 specifically four pe pipes are placed on the seabed outside the box chamber net air is injected into the central part of each pipe which causes each to float individually as a result the box chamber net floats at the edge of the fish confinement location although this system has been successfully applied to a set net fishery in ajiro japan important parameters such as accurate shape deformation of the pe pipe during floating and the tension of the mooring lines at both ends of the pipes remain unclear in this study the shape analysis of the model pipe during flotation with and without mooring lines was conducted in during a water tank experiment and the shape of the pe pipe with mooring lines in the coastal sea trial in ajiro was measured a numerical model based on the finite displacement theory is developed and verified by the water tank experiment to analyze the shape deformation of the pe pipe during flotation and the tension of the mooring lines and the stress on the pipe under actual sea condition are estimated the safety and performance of the pe pipe in the automated net hauling system are then discussed 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental pipes full scale and 1 121 scale pipes were used for the coastal sea experiment and water tank test respectively the details of the pipe material and size are listed in table 1 the material used for the full scale pipe was high density pe whereas vinyl chloride material was selected for the 1 121 scale pipe to ensure suitable flexural rigidity a 1 121 scale model of the set net was created when the fishing net model was developed the diameter of the actual net yarn and size of the net mesh were small thus if downsized according to the scale ratio the diameter and mesh of the net yarn will be extremely small therefore the similarity law proposed by tauchi was applied tauchi 1934 according to this law the geometrical shapes of a real objects and the model become similar by matching the ratio of gravity applied to the net drag and tension of the net for this purpose it is necessary to match the ratio of the twine diameter and mesh size between the actual product and the model for this study it was assumed that the ratio was 0 44 and that the flow velocity ratio and force ratio were 0 48 and 1 53 10 5 respectively based on the similarity law it should be noted that tauchi s similarity law was adopted for the modeled materials in terms of the force ratio an experiment combining the box chamber net model of the set net and the pe pipe model will performed in future research the model pipe was selected to match the shape of the actual pe pipe during flotation although the young s modulus of the pe pipe varies with temperature the value measured by the pipe manufacturer at 20 c was used because the temperature of seawater is between 15 c and 25 c because the specific gravity of the pe pipe is smaller than that of seawater a lead weight was attached to the bottom of the pipe to force it to sink to the seabed when water was supplied the experiment to confirm the behavior of one pipe was conducted using a model of the second to fourth pipes fig 1 because the size of the first pipe was too large for haul up the funnel net to match the buoyancy ratio it was sufficient to consider the similarity when the inside of the actual pe pipe was filled with air so that the inner diameter of the pe pipe model would be 0 0116 m the length of the pe pipe model was 0 87 m regarding the flexural rigidity when the same high density pe was used as the actual product the pipe became extremely thin making it difficult to model after the examination of various materials soft vinyl chloride with a density of 1322 kg m3 was selected as the pe model pipe of which the thickness d t ratio and young s modulus were 0 4 cm 4 and 2 27 106 pa respectively the bending stiffness of the pe pipe model was calculated according to these parameters the bending stiffness of pe pipe model was 5 9 10 3 pa m4 which is larger than the expected value of 1 31 10 4 pa m4 this difference addressed by adjusting the distribution of weights in the pe pipe model using a chain and a lead weight the flexural rigidity of the pe pipe model was measured in advance to be 5 00 10 3 n m2 the flexural rigidity similarity must be satisfied between the actual pe pipe and the pe pipe model flexural rigidity ei n m2 is expressed as the product of young s modulus e pa and moment of inertia of area i m4 the ratio of the flexural rigidity between the actual and model pipe can be converted into the ratios of force f n and scale l m as fl 2 n m2 because the force ratio of 1 53 10 5 n m2 according to tauchi s law was used here the ratio of flexural rigidity was 1 04 10 9 n m2 considering the scale ratio of 1 121 thus the desired flexural rigidity of the model pipe was 1 31 10 4 n m2 because that of the actual pipe was 1 26 10 5 n m2 however even in this case the value is considerably larger than the flexural rigidity of 1 31 10 4 n m2 required for the pe pipe model accordingly the weight distribution was adjusted during the experiment which enabled the shapes of the pe pipe and the full scale pipe to be as close as possible fig 2 shows the weight distribution for the second and fourth pipes to achieve similarity in the pipe deformation while floating in the actual sea conditions a sinker of 200 g m was placed at both ends of the model pipe in addition a mooring line was installed on both sides at appropriate angles and air was injected into the central part to the two ends 2 2 water tank experiment the water tank experiment was conducted in the marine ecosystem engineering laboratory at the university of tokyo fig 3 the length width and depth of the tank were 5 m 1 m and 0 55 m respectively and the water depth was 0 4 m a load cell lux b 50n id amplifier dpm 951a and analog to digital converter pcd 430a produced by kyowa electronic instruments co ltd japan were used in the experiment to measure the tension when the pipe was floating after air injection 2 3 sea trial the coastal sea trial was conducted on february 24 2016 at the set net fishery area in ajiro atami city shizuoka prefecture japan the automated net hauling system was set up on the seabed just beneath the box chamber net fig 4 fig 5 shows a photograph of the experimental setup captured by a drone an inclination of 6 along the direction of the pipe length was present when setting the four pipes therefore the length of the mooring rope of the box chamber net was different between the offshore and land sides the box chamber net was removed prior to the experiment five ultra small depth meters dms mds td jfe advantech co ltd japan were used to record the depth of the pipe when it was floating fig 6 however because one of the dms was defective the depth data from only 4 m was obtained the air discharge amount of the compressor for air injection was 755 l min and the maximum pressure was 1 4 mpa when the water depth was 70 m pressure above 0 8 mpa including the atmospheric pressure was required when injecting air into the pipe installed on the seabed 2 4 numerical simulation because the pipes used in the automated net hauling system are more flexible than the rigid bodies the finite element method was adopted in this study when analyzing the shape of the pipes after floating trana 2002 when the pipe end began to ascend from the seabed the pipe shape and the tension of the mooring rope were calculated in the numerical simulation based on the finite displacement theory assuming that the motion of the pipe was slow and quasi static although it ignores the inertial effects and is not able to calculate the ballistic movement the quasi static scheme can be used in applications with relatively small inertial effects thus it is suitable for application to pipe deformation wiggert and tijsseling 2001 jensen and fossen 2009 zhang and jar ben 2017 the consistency of the analysis including the tension of the mooring rope was confirmed through numerical analysis and model experiments in the net hauling system proposed here the mooring tension and stress on the pipe were maximum when the pipe end separated from the seabed thus no vertical drag force was present on the pipe the amount of air in the pipe needed for balancing the forces was estimated and the pipe shape at that time was calculated the force and moment on the pipe microelements are represented in fig 7 a the displacement of the pipe can be described using the following equations because angle d θ is small it was considered that sin θ d θ and cos θ 1 1 d t d l f d θ d l w sin θ 2 d f d l t d θ d l w cos θ 3 d m d l f 4 d θ d l m e i 5 d x d l cos θ 6 d y d l sin θ in these equations l is the length of the microelement m x and y are the coordinates of the microelement m f is the shear force n t is the axial force n w is the distributed weight n m m is the bending moment n m θ is the deflection angle rad e is the young s modulus pa and i is the moment of inertia of area m4 when the mooring line is connected to the end of the pipe the tension from the mooring line and its angle need to be considered as shown in fig 7b the tension from the mooring line is denoted as t m n the angle between the mooring line and seabed is θ m rad and the angle of the pipe end microelement is θ 1 rad the axial force on the pipe end microelement is represented as t t m cos θ m θ 1 and the shear force can be described as f t m sin θ m θ 1 2 5 initial conditions the center of the pipe was taken as 0 in the x coordinate and the pipe was divided into 1000 elements for calculation the initial values of each parameter of the pipe end with and without mooring lines are represented in table 2 in the water tank experiment with the mooring rope the mooring rope angle θ m and the mooring tension t m were unknown when the pipe shape was unknown and the pipe angle θ 1 was unknown in the pipe end microelement at that time θ 1 was uniquely determined for each mooring rope angle θ m and mooring tension t m so to make the pipe symmetrical the initial values in the coastal sea experiment are shown in fig 6 the seabed topography was assumed to be flat and the angle of the pipe end and mooring tension satisfied the bilateral symmetry of the pipe shape the midpoint of the mooring line for the box chamber net and the pe pipe end was connected to another mooring line the mooring angle θ m at the position at which the pipe end began to ascend from the seabed was assumed as 0 302 rad based on the node position of the mooring line and the position range of the pipe ends on the seabed to determine the effect of the mooring angle on the mooring tension and bending stress the pipe shape was calculated at 0 02 rad intervals from 0 342 rad to 0 242 rad at which points the pipes were touching the bottom and the pipe ends moved near the central pipe respectively 3 result and discussion 3 1 model verification in the water tank experiment fig 8 shows the time series of the pipe shape under flotation conditions the difference in shape was small when the pipe was floating when the experimental and numerical results were compared the shape of the pe pipe was assumed to be constant when floating fig 9 shows a comparison of the experimental and numerical results of the pipe shape with and without the mooring lines according to this comparison the deformations calculated by the numerical simulations were in good agreement with those of the water tank experiments however the simulated central point of the pipe without the mooring line was slightly higher than that determined in the experiments and the edge points were narrower a possible explanation is that the fluid resistance acting on the central part of the pipe could have been greater than that at the end part in the experiment although this was not considered in the calculation because the motion process of the pipe was assumed to be quasi static in the numerical model on the contrary the dynamic change in fluid resistance was limited partly by the mooring lines therefore the pipe deformation was reproduced well in the case with mooring lines table 3 lists the calculated model state variables for the pipe the moment was maximum at the central part of the pipe whereas the axial force and shear force reached maximum values between the center and ends of the pipe under both conditions the difference is that the direction of the moment near the pipe end became negative when the pipe was attached to the mooring line this could explain the larger deformation of the pipe shape without mooring lines as shown in fig 9 the central point of the pipes with and without the mooring lines reached 0 29 m and 0 24 m respectively when both ends of the pipe were began to ascend from the bottom of the water tank after air injection the simulated central points under both conditions were 0 31 m and 0 246 m respectively under the condition with mooring lines the tension on the right mooring line was 0 066 n which is 0 013 n greater than that on the left line the light motion of the pipe at left side during flotation is attributed to the unbalanced buoyancy inside the pipe when air was injected the average mooring tension in the numerical simulation was 0 074 n larger than the average value in the model experiment because the axial force in the y direction pressing on the pipe was used to substitute the fluid resistance in the numerical simulation moreover the dynamic change in the floating speed was not considered in the finite displacement theory because the calculation was based on the equilibrium of forces 3 2 model application to sea trial in the sea trial five dms were attached dm 1 and dm 5 were attached to the end of the pipe dm 3 was attached to the center of the pipe and dm 2 and dm 4 were attached at the midpoint between the center and end of the pipe fig 6 however as previously mentioned the data of only four dms were analyzed because dm 4 was defective the dotted rectangle in fig 10 shows the pipe flotation area which implies that the deformation shape was almost the same while the pipes were floating therefore the pipe shape for the experimental and numerical results was compared under the assumption that the shape did not change while floating fig 11 a shows that the simulated locations matched well with the data from the dms the deformation of the pipe shape was reproduced successfully by the numerical model which indicates that the pipe shape was accurately estimated to some extent through numerical simulation even considering the limited depth data however a 2 m difference was observed between the simulation and experimental results for the second dm on the left side a reasonable explanation is that the inclination of the seabed was not considered in the actual sea the seabed is inclined at 6 along the pipe direction however the numerical simulation ignored this for simplicity moreover the weight of the box chamber net acted on the actual pe pipe which might have lowered the position of the pipe hydrodynamic force in the actual sea can also account for the difference the maximum bending stress distribution of the entire pipe is shown in fig 11b the central part end was convex concave and the bending stress direction was reversed from the central part to the end moreover variation was found in the mooring tension and maximum bending stress of the pipe at different mooring angles although both values were generally constant fig 12 the mooring tension increased proportionally with the change in mooring angle and a negative linear relationship was observed between them when the maximum bending stress on the pipes decreased accordingly a positive linear relationship was obtained 3 3 safety and performance of the pipe the bending strength of the high density pe used in this study was about 69 mpa of which 1 3 23 mpa was set as the allowable bending stress the maximum bending stress of the pipe calculated from the numerical model was about 10 mpa which is within the allowable range accordingly the safety rate concerning the bending stress of the full scale pipe was 2 3 times higher indicating that the risk of pipe breakage in the auto net hauling system was considerably low within this sea trial the box chamber net was not considered in either the experiment or the simulation in practice this net is placed at the middle part of the pipe and creates extra loading therefore the deformation of the pipe shape in practice would be smaller in both the experiment and the simulation the bending moment was also reduced in the central part of the pipe which would increase the safety rate in practical operations however it should be considered that the mooring tension on the pipes affected the mooring line of the box chamber net because the mooring line of the pipe was attached to that of the box chamber net in particular considering that the anchoring force might not be sufficient when the extra tension is present the weight of the anchor needs to be increased in correspondence to the mooring tension calculated by the numerical model as shown in fig 10 the shape of the pipe did not change significantly during the floating operation regarding the bending moment of the pipe the pipe motion was therefore assumed to be quasi static in this study currently the net hauling operation of the box chamber net takes about 40 min because the approximate length and depth of the box chamber net is 120 m and 70 m respectively the net moves 3 m min and 1 75 m min in the horizontal and vertical directions respectively in the sea trial the maximum upward speed of the pipe was 1 m s which is significantly larger than the speed of the current net hauling operation this speed can be regulated for effective harvesting in practical applications however dynamic simulation is beyond the scope of this study and will be performed in future research for this purpose the time variation in air flow in the pipe including the expansion and compression under pressure variation should be modeled to estimate the buoyancy distribution on the pipe moreover laboratory and field testing of the pipe deformation should be conducted under complex conditions with wave and water flow and the corresponding dynamic analysis is required to effectively understand the performance of the proposed net hauling system regarding the performance of this net hauling system biological testing was not conducted for optimizing design parameters such as the floating speed of the pipe and the mesh size of the box chamber net which depend strongly on the fish size and species essentially fish do not touch the box chamber net during the net hauling operation because they tend to escape from the approaching net toward the opposite direction although some fish are directed to the box chamber net floating near the pipe fish smaller than the mesh size of the box chamber net cannot escape through the net the pipe floats in a dome form which enables some fish to reverse their direction and escape from both sides of the box chamber net thus the fish size rather than the species can affect the desirable shape of the pipe sea trials using several sizes and species of fish should be conducted in future research to investigate the behavior of fish during the net hauling operation if fish can escape from both sides of the box chamber net the shape of the pipe needs to be flatter which can be accomplished by controlling air injection rate or varying the buoyancy of the pipe 4 conclusions an automated net hauling system using pe pipes was newly developed in this study numerical simulation water tank testing and field experiments were employed to evaluate the deformation shape of the pipe during flotation and to determine the tension of the mooring lines when both ends of the pipe began to ascend from the seabed after air injection the central points of both the full scale and model pipe with mooring lines reached 0 29 m and 32 4 m respectively the pipe deformation calculated by numerical simulation was in good agreement with that determined in water tank and actual sea experiments the maximum bending stress of the pipe calculated from the numerical model was about 10 mpa which is less than the allowable bending stress and the safety rate was 2 3 these results indicate that the pipe breakage will not occur in the auto net hauling system during the flotation the shape analysis of the pipes was based on the finite displacement theory in this study however the dynamic shape change was not considered in the numerical simulation which resulted in differences in the pipe deformation and mooring tension between the experiment and simulation results the calculation of the dynamic shape change was difficult to conduct based on the balance of forces hence this factor coupled with the motion equation of the entire pipe to improve the precision of the numerical simulation although the deformation of the pipe shape in the coastal sea can be reproduced using numerical analysis the current study modeled the pipe deformation without using the box chamber net further research including this net the shape deformation of the pipe and the weight load on the pipe was discussed accordingly additional research will benefit from monitoring the behavior of the box chamber net and simulating its shape change credit authorship contribution statement junbo zhang methodology data curation visualization writing original draft

20641,the use of an automated net hauling system using four polyethylene pe pipes is proposed in this study to increase the efficiency of set net fishery in this system the pipes are installed on the seabed beneath a box chamber net compressed air is injected into the first pipe at the slope net and then into the other pipes in succession in this system the fish are cornered between the fourth pipe and the end of the box chamber net the performance of the system from the second to the fourth pipe is evaluated using numerical analysis water tank tests and field experiments in addition a static numerical model for the deformation of the pe pipes is developed using the theory of finite deformation and is validated by the results of the water tank and coastal sea experiments the results show that the maximal bending stress of the full scale pipe is about 10 mpa which is within the allowable range of 23 mpa indicating that the risk of pipe breakage in the automated net hauling system is considerably low therefore the automated net hauling system developed in this study has high application value and development potential in set net fishery keywords set net fishery automated net hauling system box chamber net polyethylene pipe 1 introduction set net fishery is a passive type of fishery generally applied along the paths of migrating fish at traditional sites in coastal areas less than 100 m in depth this system consists of netting devices used for herding and restraining including a leader net a panel net impounding a playground an ascending slope net a funnel net and a box chamber net hiramoto 1994 1997 1997 he and inoue 2010 wan et al 2020 the leader net extends from the entrance of the playground and is usually normal to the coastline along which the fish generally swim through the ascending slope and funnel nets fish can be herded and guided into the box chamber net where they fish are confined until harvesting wan et al 2020 set net fishery has achieved worldwide attention for its low impact on habitats and good fuel efficiency because high oil consumption for exploratory fishing is not required fish below catchable size can be released alive and intrusion and damages to fish mammals and turtles are prevented konigson et al 2013 lehtonen and suuronen 2004 2010 shen and heino 2014 suuronen et al 2012 sun et al 2006 wang and tsai 2014 net hauling operations in set net fishery require a considerable workforce for daily harvesting which is labor intensive and time consuming suuronen et al 2012 many developed countries are currently facing challenges of imminent labor shortage caused by aging populations moreover the number of fishers will decrease in the future which will cause an extended downturn in set net fishery kitazawa et al 2012 suuronen et al 2012 the development of an automated hauling system is therefore a reliable solution in the fishery industry kitazawa et al 2018 since the 1960s several complementary devices have been developed to save labor oitsuki 2004 in particular a rubber tube was considered for the design of a net hauling system in the 1980s fukahori et al 1988 decades later in the 21st century an automated hauling system using interconnected fire hoses was developed and tested kitazawa et al 2018 however this system is still under development because the durability of the fire hose connections has not been established li et al 2019 2020 a recent study conducted on the hydrodynamic performance of set net systems in water currents calculated the equilibrium configuration and the tension distribution of the set net using the finite element method and a physical model test in a flume tank wan et al 2020 however an automated net hauling system has not been considered thus far polyethylene pe pipes of suitable stiffness are newly proposed in the present study for use in an automated net hauling system fig 1 specifically four pe pipes are placed on the seabed outside the box chamber net air is injected into the central part of each pipe which causes each to float individually as a result the box chamber net floats at the edge of the fish confinement location although this system has been successfully applied to a set net fishery in ajiro japan important parameters such as accurate shape deformation of the pe pipe during floating and the tension of the mooring lines at both ends of the pipes remain unclear in this study the shape analysis of the model pipe during flotation with and without mooring lines was conducted in during a water tank experiment and the shape of the pe pipe with mooring lines in the coastal sea trial in ajiro was measured a numerical model based on the finite displacement theory is developed and verified by the water tank experiment to analyze the shape deformation of the pe pipe during flotation and the tension of the mooring lines and the stress on the pipe under actual sea condition are estimated the safety and performance of the pe pipe in the automated net hauling system are then discussed 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental pipes full scale and 1 121 scale pipes were used for the coastal sea experiment and water tank test respectively the details of the pipe material and size are listed in table 1 the material used for the full scale pipe was high density pe whereas vinyl chloride material was selected for the 1 121 scale pipe to ensure suitable flexural rigidity a 1 121 scale model of the set net was created when the fishing net model was developed the diameter of the actual net yarn and size of the net mesh were small thus if downsized according to the scale ratio the diameter and mesh of the net yarn will be extremely small therefore the similarity law proposed by tauchi was applied tauchi 1934 according to this law the geometrical shapes of a real objects and the model become similar by matching the ratio of gravity applied to the net drag and tension of the net for this purpose it is necessary to match the ratio of the twine diameter and mesh size between the actual product and the model for this study it was assumed that the ratio was 0 44 and that the flow velocity ratio and force ratio were 0 48 and 1 53 10 5 respectively based on the similarity law it should be noted that tauchi s similarity law was adopted for the modeled materials in terms of the force ratio an experiment combining the box chamber net model of the set net and the pe pipe model will performed in future research the model pipe was selected to match the shape of the actual pe pipe during flotation although the young s modulus of the pe pipe varies with temperature the value measured by the pipe manufacturer at 20 c was used because the temperature of seawater is between 15 c and 25 c because the specific gravity of the pe pipe is smaller than that of seawater a lead weight was attached to the bottom of the pipe to force it to sink to the seabed when water was supplied the experiment to confirm the behavior of one pipe was conducted using a model of the second to fourth pipes fig 1 because the size of the first pipe was too large for haul up the funnel net to match the buoyancy ratio it was sufficient to consider the similarity when the inside of the actual pe pipe was filled with air so that the inner diameter of the pe pipe model would be 0 0116 m the length of the pe pipe model was 0 87 m regarding the flexural rigidity when the same high density pe was used as the actual product the pipe became extremely thin making it difficult to model after the examination of various materials soft vinyl chloride with a density of 1322 kg m3 was selected as the pe model pipe of which the thickness d t ratio and young s modulus were 0 4 cm 4 and 2 27 106 pa respectively the bending stiffness of the pe pipe model was calculated according to these parameters the bending stiffness of pe pipe model was 5 9 10 3 pa m4 which is larger than the expected value of 1 31 10 4 pa m4 this difference addressed by adjusting the distribution of weights in the pe pipe model using a chain and a lead weight the flexural rigidity of the pe pipe model was measured in advance to be 5 00 10 3 n m2 the flexural rigidity similarity must be satisfied between the actual pe pipe and the pe pipe model flexural rigidity ei n m2 is expressed as the product of young s modulus e pa and moment of inertia of area i m4 the ratio of the flexural rigidity between the actual and model pipe can be converted into the ratios of force f n and scale l m as fl 2 n m2 because the force ratio of 1 53 10 5 n m2 according to tauchi s law was used here the ratio of flexural rigidity was 1 04 10 9 n m2 considering the scale ratio of 1 121 thus the desired flexural rigidity of the model pipe was 1 31 10 4 n m2 because that of the actual pipe was 1 26 10 5 n m2 however even in this case the value is considerably larger than the flexural rigidity of 1 31 10 4 n m2 required for the pe pipe model accordingly the weight distribution was adjusted during the experiment which enabled the shapes of the pe pipe and the full scale pipe to be as close as possible fig 2 shows the weight distribution for the second and fourth pipes to achieve similarity in the pipe deformation while floating in the actual sea conditions a sinker of 200 g m was placed at both ends of the model pipe in addition a mooring line was installed on both sides at appropriate angles and air was injected into the central part to the two ends 2 2 water tank experiment the water tank experiment was conducted in the marine ecosystem engineering laboratory at the university of tokyo fig 3 the length width and depth of the tank were 5 m 1 m and 0 55 m respectively and the water depth was 0 4 m a load cell lux b 50n id amplifier dpm 951a and analog to digital converter pcd 430a produced by kyowa electronic instruments co ltd japan were used in the experiment to measure the tension when the pipe was floating after air injection 2 3 sea trial the coastal sea trial was conducted on february 24 2016 at the set net fishery area in ajiro atami city shizuoka prefecture japan the automated net hauling system was set up on the seabed just beneath the box chamber net fig 4 fig 5 shows a photograph of the experimental setup captured by a drone an inclination of 6 along the direction of the pipe length was present when setting the four pipes therefore the length of the mooring rope of the box chamber net was different between the offshore and land sides the box chamber net was removed prior to the experiment five ultra small depth meters dms mds td jfe advantech co ltd japan were used to record the depth of the pipe when it was floating fig 6 however because one of the dms was defective the depth data from only 4 m was obtained the air discharge amount of the compressor for air injection was 755 l min and the maximum pressure was 1 4 mpa when the water depth was 70 m pressure above 0 8 mpa including the atmospheric pressure was required when injecting air into the pipe installed on the seabed 2 4 numerical simulation because the pipes used in the automated net hauling system are more flexible than the rigid bodies the finite element method was adopted in this study when analyzing the shape of the pipes after floating trana 2002 when the pipe end began to ascend from the seabed the pipe shape and the tension of the mooring rope were calculated in the numerical simulation based on the finite displacement theory assuming that the motion of the pipe was slow and quasi static although it ignores the inertial effects and is not able to calculate the ballistic movement the quasi static scheme can be used in applications with relatively small inertial effects thus it is suitable for application to pipe deformation wiggert and tijsseling 2001 jensen and fossen 2009 zhang and jar ben 2017 the consistency of the analysis including the tension of the mooring rope was confirmed through numerical analysis and model experiments in the net hauling system proposed here the mooring tension and stress on the pipe were maximum when the pipe end separated from the seabed thus no vertical drag force was present on the pipe the amount of air in the pipe needed for balancing the forces was estimated and the pipe shape at that time was calculated the force and moment on the pipe microelements are represented in fig 7 a the displacement of the pipe can be described using the following equations because angle d θ is small it was considered that sin θ d θ and cos θ 1 1 d t d l f d θ d l w sin θ 2 d f d l t d θ d l w cos θ 3 d m d l f 4 d θ d l m e i 5 d x d l cos θ 6 d y d l sin θ in these equations l is the length of the microelement m x and y are the coordinates of the microelement m f is the shear force n t is the axial force n w is the distributed weight n m m is the bending moment n m θ is the deflection angle rad e is the young s modulus pa and i is the moment of inertia of area m4 when the mooring line is connected to the end of the pipe the tension from the mooring line and its angle need to be considered as shown in fig 7b the tension from the mooring line is denoted as t m n the angle between the mooring line and seabed is θ m rad and the angle of the pipe end microelement is θ 1 rad the axial force on the pipe end microelement is represented as t t m cos θ m θ 1 and the shear force can be described as f t m sin θ m θ 1 2 5 initial conditions the center of the pipe was taken as 0 in the x coordinate and the pipe was divided into 1000 elements for calculation the initial values of each parameter of the pipe end with and without mooring lines are represented in table 2 in the water tank experiment with the mooring rope the mooring rope angle θ m and the mooring tension t m were unknown when the pipe shape was unknown and the pipe angle θ 1 was unknown in the pipe end microelement at that time θ 1 was uniquely determined for each mooring rope angle θ m and mooring tension t m so to make the pipe symmetrical the initial values in the coastal sea experiment are shown in fig 6 the seabed topography was assumed to be flat and the angle of the pipe end and mooring tension satisfied the bilateral symmetry of the pipe shape the midpoint of the mooring line for the box chamber net and the pe pipe end was connected to another mooring line the mooring angle θ m at the position at which the pipe end began to ascend from the seabed was assumed as 0 302 rad based on the node position of the mooring line and the position range of the pipe ends on the seabed to determine the effect of the mooring angle on the mooring tension and bending stress the pipe shape was calculated at 0 02 rad intervals from 0 342 rad to 0 242 rad at which points the pipes were touching the bottom and the pipe ends moved near the central pipe respectively 3 result and discussion 3 1 model verification in the water tank experiment fig 8 shows the time series of the pipe shape under flotation conditions the difference in shape was small when the pipe was floating when the experimental and numerical results were compared the shape of the pe pipe was assumed to be constant when floating fig 9 shows a comparison of the experimental and numerical results of the pipe shape with and without the mooring lines according to this comparison the deformations calculated by the numerical simulations were in good agreement with those of the water tank experiments however the simulated central point of the pipe without the mooring line was slightly higher than that determined in the experiments and the edge points were narrower a possible explanation is that the fluid resistance acting on the central part of the pipe could have been greater than that at the end part in the experiment although this was not considered in the calculation because the motion process of the pipe was assumed to be quasi static in the numerical model on the contrary the dynamic change in fluid resistance was limited partly by the mooring lines therefore the pipe deformation was reproduced well in the case with mooring lines table 3 lists the calculated model state variables for the pipe the moment was maximum at the central part of the pipe whereas the axial force and shear force reached maximum values between the center and ends of the pipe under both conditions the difference is that the direction of the moment near the pipe end became negative when the pipe was attached to the mooring line this could explain the larger deformation of the pipe shape without mooring lines as shown in fig 9 the central point of the pipes with and without the mooring lines reached 0 29 m and 0 24 m respectively when both ends of the pipe were began to ascend from the bottom of the water tank after air injection the simulated central points under both conditions were 0 31 m and 0 246 m respectively under the condition with mooring lines the tension on the right mooring line was 0 066 n which is 0 013 n greater than that on the left line the light motion of the pipe at left side during flotation is attributed to the unbalanced buoyancy inside the pipe when air was injected the average mooring tension in the numerical simulation was 0 074 n larger than the average value in the model experiment because the axial force in the y direction pressing on the pipe was used to substitute the fluid resistance in the numerical simulation moreover the dynamic change in the floating speed was not considered in the finite displacement theory because the calculation was based on the equilibrium of forces 3 2 model application to sea trial in the sea trial five dms were attached dm 1 and dm 5 were attached to the end of the pipe dm 3 was attached to the center of the pipe and dm 2 and dm 4 were attached at the midpoint between the center and end of the pipe fig 6 however as previously mentioned the data of only four dms were analyzed because dm 4 was defective the dotted rectangle in fig 10 shows the pipe flotation area which implies that the deformation shape was almost the same while the pipes were floating therefore the pipe shape for the experimental and numerical results was compared under the assumption that the shape did not change while floating fig 11 a shows that the simulated locations matched well with the data from the dms the deformation of the pipe shape was reproduced successfully by the numerical model which indicates that the pipe shape was accurately estimated to some extent through numerical simulation even considering the limited depth data however a 2 m difference was observed between the simulation and experimental results for the second dm on the left side a reasonable explanation is that the inclination of the seabed was not considered in the actual sea the seabed is inclined at 6 along the pipe direction however the numerical simulation ignored this for simplicity moreover the weight of the box chamber net acted on the actual pe pipe which might have lowered the position of the pipe hydrodynamic force in the actual sea can also account for the difference the maximum bending stress distribution of the entire pipe is shown in fig 11b the central part end was convex concave and the bending stress direction was reversed from the central part to the end moreover variation was found in the mooring tension and maximum bending stress of the pipe at different mooring angles although both values were generally constant fig 12 the mooring tension increased proportionally with the change in mooring angle and a negative linear relationship was observed between them when the maximum bending stress on the pipes decreased accordingly a positive linear relationship was obtained 3 3 safety and performance of the pipe the bending strength of the high density pe used in this study was about 69 mpa of which 1 3 23 mpa was set as the allowable bending stress the maximum bending stress of the pipe calculated from the numerical model was about 10 mpa which is within the allowable range accordingly the safety rate concerning the bending stress of the full scale pipe was 2 3 times higher indicating that the risk of pipe breakage in the auto net hauling system was considerably low within this sea trial the box chamber net was not considered in either the experiment or the simulation in practice this net is placed at the middle part of the pipe and creates extra loading therefore the deformation of the pipe shape in practice would be smaller in both the experiment and the simulation the bending moment was also reduced in the central part of the pipe which would increase the safety rate in practical operations however it should be considered that the mooring tension on the pipes affected the mooring line of the box chamber net because the mooring line of the pipe was attached to that of the box chamber net in particular considering that the anchoring force might not be sufficient when the extra tension is present the weight of the anchor needs to be increased in correspondence to the mooring tension calculated by the numerical model as shown in fig 10 the shape of the pipe did not change significantly during the floating operation regarding the bending moment of the pipe the pipe motion was therefore assumed to be quasi static in this study currently the net hauling operation of the box chamber net takes about 40 min because the approximate length and depth of the box chamber net is 120 m and 70 m respectively the net moves 3 m min and 1 75 m min in the horizontal and vertical directions respectively in the sea trial the maximum upward speed of the pipe was 1 m s which is significantly larger than the speed of the current net hauling operation this speed can be regulated for effective harvesting in practical applications however dynamic simulation is beyond the scope of this study and will be performed in future research for this purpose the time variation in air flow in the pipe including the expansion and compression under pressure variation should be modeled to estimate the buoyancy distribution on the pipe moreover laboratory and field testing of the pipe deformation should be conducted under complex conditions with wave and water flow and the corresponding dynamic analysis is required to effectively understand the performance of the proposed net hauling system regarding the performance of this net hauling system biological testing was not conducted for optimizing design parameters such as the floating speed of the pipe and the mesh size of the box chamber net which depend strongly on the fish size and species essentially fish do not touch the box chamber net during the net hauling operation because they tend to escape from the approaching net toward the opposite direction although some fish are directed to the box chamber net floating near the pipe fish smaller than the mesh size of the box chamber net cannot escape through the net the pipe floats in a dome form which enables some fish to reverse their direction and escape from both sides of the box chamber net thus the fish size rather than the species can affect the desirable shape of the pipe sea trials using several sizes and species of fish should be conducted in future research to investigate the behavior of fish during the net hauling operation if fish can escape from both sides of the box chamber net the shape of the pipe needs to be flatter which can be accomplished by controlling air injection rate or varying the buoyancy of the pipe 4 conclusions an automated net hauling system using pe pipes was newly developed in this study numerical simulation water tank testing and field experiments were employed to evaluate the deformation shape of the pipe during flotation and to determine the tension of the mooring lines when both ends of the pipe began to ascend from the seabed after air injection the central points of both the full scale and model pipe with mooring lines reached 0 29 m and 32 4 m respectively the pipe deformation calculated by numerical simulation was in good agreement with that determined in water tank and actual sea experiments the maximum bending stress of the pipe calculated from the numerical model was about 10 mpa which is less than the allowable bending stress and the safety rate was 2 3 these results indicate that the pipe breakage will not occur in the auto net hauling system during the flotation the shape analysis of the pipes was based on the finite displacement theory in this study however the dynamic shape change was not considered in the numerical simulation which resulted in differences in the pipe deformation and mooring tension between the experiment and simulation results the calculation of the dynamic shape change was difficult to conduct based on the balance of forces hence this factor coupled with the motion equation of the entire pipe to improve the precision of the numerical simulation although the deformation of the pipe shape in the coastal sea can be reproduced using numerical analysis the current study modeled the pipe deformation without using the box chamber net further research including this net the shape deformation of the pipe and the weight load on the pipe was discussed accordingly additional research will benefit from monitoring the behavior of the box chamber net and simulating its shape change credit authorship contribution statement junbo zhang methodology data curation visualization writing original draft

vessel is input coordinate system and initial position of the ship are defined the wave type 5th order stokes wave is selected wave parameters including wave height wavelength incidence angle and initial phase etc are given quality attributes of the ship design speed and fluid density are defined then the constraint condition is determined the hull surface and the free surface are treated by meshing subdivision finally the solution conditions are set which include the largest number of iterations the time step and the initial free surface wave 3 2 test models and wave conditions to investigate the phenomenon of added resistance three conventional ship types are compared with prv the added resistance of the medium size moeri tanker kvlcc2 s175 containership and kcs containership are performed in this paper prv can accomplish multiple missions including oceanography scientific investigation and polar research prv is equipped with two azimuth thrusters at stern and the aftbody will appear a flat bottom instead of a whole streamline aftbody they offer a superb maneuvering capability but the shapes of their aftbody are different prv used a spoon icebreaking bow which means it is full bow form the center of buoyancy is rather far forward relative to non prvs the station of maximum beam is usually well forward of amidships and entrance angles are quite large this full forebody characteristic may affect the seakeeping performance and lead to the increasing of open water resistance fig 1 presents the ship models and table 1 describes the particulars of the investigated ships in general l b is minimum in four ships and the block coefficient cb is second only to kvlcc2 in the numerical simulations the origin of the ship fixed reference frame is located at its center of gravity cog the inertial frame of reference is located at the waterline in the fore perpendicular in this study the naked hull that is not equipped with bilge keels shaft brackets and rudders all ships were studied in model scale to obtain the best comparability with experimental results by avoiding scaling effects table 2 shows the wave conditions corresponding to the four ships and they will be transformed to the model scale 3 3 added resistance calculation the resistance of the selected ship has been calculated in calm water and waves the average added resistance due to waves r aw is obtained by eq 22 22 r a w r w r c where r w and r c are total resistance in waves and resistance in calm water respectively the calculation formula of transfer function of non dimensional added resistance is expressed as 23 r a w r a w ρ g ζ 2 b 2 l p p where r aw is added resistance in regular waves ρ is the density g is the acceleration of gravity ζ is the wave amplitude of regular waves b is the water line beam lpp is the length between perpendiculars for comparison s sake non dimensional amplitudes are plotted against the non dimensional wave frequency ω defined as follows 24 ω l p p λ the non dimensional amplitude of heave and pitch motions are expressed as 25 c z z a ζ a 26 c θ θ a k ζ a 27 k 360 λ ζ a is the wave amplitude of regular waves and equals half of the wave height z a and θ a is the average amplitude of heave and pitch motion c z and c θ is the corresponding non dimensional heave and pitch motion 3 4 configuration in nonlinear unsteady potential flow method calculations half of the ship s hull under the still water level is modelled using quadratic panels while 8 panels per wavelength as the maximum length of each panel are used for the highest encounter frequency a right handed coordinate system x y z used in the gothenburg 2010 workshop is adopted here the numerical and experimental results are all transferred into this coordinate for comparison and analysis as a rule vessel headings are specified as the direction in which the vessel v x axis is pointing relative to global axes directions for waves are specified by giving the direction in which the wave is progressing wave direction equals 180 meaning that the wave propagates in the opposite direction of the ship heading one regular wave based on 5th order stokes wave theory will be used the wave form is determined by a wave height and a wave length the phase of the wave is set as zero meaning that a wave peak coincides with lpp 2 at time zero the wave direction is 180 meaning that the wave propagates in the opposite direction of the ship heading moreover the simulation will continue until the ship has encountered 1 wave normally a recommended number of wave encounters are 12 the calculations are done for surface domain of one ship length upstream two ship lengths downstream the width of the free surface is one ship length fig 2 shows the example of kcs in medium mesh the body and free surface is meshed using 23604 bem panels 3 5 verification good validation data is essential when testing nonlinear potential flow method there are large amounts of experimental and computed results available kcs containership was chosen as an example the experimental data of kcs container in this thesis is mainly from tokyo 2015 workshop national maritime research institute 2015 kcs is a modern container ship with bulb bow and stern developed by moeri and used as an example hull in this research the comparison was wave added resistance coefficient heave and pitch motion in order to eliminate the influence of scale effect the scale ship model is used in the calculation as in the experiment three different mesh systems are used for calculating added resistance the coarse mesh comprised about 10497 meshes the medium mesh about 23604 meshes the fine mesh about 43888 meshes for fn 0 26 the total calm water resistance is 51 136 n the coefficient is 3 794e 2 deviates by 1 07 from the model test results table 3 shows the calm water resistance and motions compared with the experiment the wave conditions and parameters set in the software are consistent with the experimental configuration fig 3 and fig 4 shows the computed wave added resistance coefficients and vertical motions compared with the experimental results the nonlinear potential method provides a satisfactory result fig 5 shows the comparison of wave contour in calm water and in waves for the kcs containership for three different mesh systems obviously the ship induced wave pattern is more pronounced in waves the difference can be found near the ship surface of the shoulder region in the presence of incident wave wave patterns of three mesh systems are very similar to each other in wave conditions the finest case shows slightly higher wave elevation than the other cases it increases the added resistance as shown in fig 3 cause the waterline integration of the wave elevation is a dominant component of the added resistance considering the time consuming and results accuracy of different mesh settings medium mesh system is used in the following calculations to reduce uncertainties related to discretization errors all computations were performed on the same mesh using the same numerical settings 4 analysis of calculation results figs 6 7 presents the time histories of computed longitudinal force for the four investigated ships advancing at constant forward speed in short and long regular head waves it could be seen nonlinearities of longitudinal force for the prv it is this ship that is characterized by higher bow flare angles 4 1 results of added resistance experimental results of added resistance are useful to understand the characteristics and validate the results of numerical analysis the comparison data of kvlcc2 tanker is mainly from the gothenburg 2010 workshop on ship hydrodynamics larsson et al 2013 added resistances on a s175 containership were measured by fujii and takahashi fujii 1975 nakamura and naito nakamura and naito 1977 and fonseca and soares fonseca and guedessoares 2004 the comparable normalized added resistance coefficient in regular head waves shown in fig 8 as plots of the tanker and containerships demonstrates here also the generally favorable agreement between computations and measurements zakaria and baree 2007 have discussed the variation of added resistance caused by the block coefficient cb the added resistance increases with the cb increased when series 60 hull block coefficient is from 0 6 to 0 8 ship with larger cb usually have larger added resistance and peak value of added resistance will move into the longer wave because the larger cb reduce the natural frequencies of heave and pitch fig 9 compares the added resistance coefficients of the four investigated ships at similar froude numbers unlike the other three ships the prv does not have a bulbous bow however the hull is quite full and the block coefficient is large sort by the block coefficient in order are kvlcc2 tanker prv kcs and s175 containership for the tanker and containerships the peak value of added resistance coefficient is about λ lpp 1 1 although the block coefficient of prv is samller than kvlcc2 the wave length ship length ration of peak value of added resistance coefficient tends to longer wave and is about 1 2 this is probably because lack of bulbous bow to reduce wave resistance which is the main components of added resistance many other model tests on added resistance have been conducted since 1970s park and lee 2019 the added resistance experiments in the head sea conditions based on the literature information available has been summarized fig 10 showed the added resistance coefficient compared with prv s it can be seen that added resistance coefficient of the prv is still higher than these data significantly in both long waves and short waves thus the overall wave resistance in head seas the maximum value of added resistance occurs at wavelengths slightly larger than the length of the vessel as the wavelength increases the added resistance decreases and almost disappears when wavelength is double of the ship length as the wavelength decreases the added resistance decreases and tends to a stable value it may show the trend of added resistance coefficient under typical sea condition at design speed 4 2 effects of heave and pitch motions on added resistance in waves added resistance is closely related to the vertical motions accurate prediction of motions was required as shown in fig 11 overall tendencies of the heave and pitch motions are similar to each other and show good agreement with experimental data in the above wavelength range the unexpected deviation between the calculated vertical motion and the measured vertical motion cannot be explained which may be caused by the uncertainty related to the measured vertical motion in the conventional ships the maximum value of non dimensional amplitudes of heave and pitch motion is slightly shifted towards to longer waves for the tanker because the hull of tanker is blunter than containership although block coefficient of prv is lower than that of tanker the maximum value of the response operator tends to long wave 4 3 effects of ship speed on added resistance in waves claus d simonsen simonsen et al 2013 compared the vertical motion and added resistance of kcs containership under three speeds the results showed that maximum vertical response and added resistance occurred at maximum speed the peak value of added resistance will move to longer wave as speed increases to investigate the effects of ship speed on the vertical motion and added resistance computation was conducted at various forward speeds albeit only for the containership and the prv for the prv computations were performed at full scale speeds of 15 and 16 5 knots corresponding to froude numbers of 0 205 and 0 225 respectively for the kcs containership at 20 and 24 knots corresponding to froude number of 0 21 and 0 26 respectively the comparative non dimensional amplitudes of added resistance and heave and pitch motions are shown in fig 12 and fig 13 as expected the added resistance in waves is more at higher ship speeds for kcs and prv in the range of wave length equal to ship length the added resistance in waves are noticeably increasing heave motions are distinctly in long waves less at slower ship speeds pitch motions are nearly unaffected by ship speed 4 4 effects of wave steepness on added resistance in waves until now we assumed that added resistance in waves is the second order quantity in the wave amplitude journee 1976 different from added resistance motions change linearly however ships operate in waves of variable steepness thus the question arose in what way this assumption is valid to resolve this issue we computed the added resistance in waves for the vessels in waves of different steepness here defined as wave height divided by the ship length the non dimensional amplitudes of heave and pitch motion of kvlcc2 and prv are almost the same under two different wave steepness as shown in fig 14 that is the relationship between ship motion and wave amplitude is linear it can be found in fig 15 that the added resistance coefficient of kvlcc2 is approximate equivalent it accords with the quadratic correlation between added resistance and wave amplitude however added resistance of prv doesn t show a good quadratic relationship 5 conclusion the feasibility of the three dimensional full nonlinear time domain potential flow theory in the calculation of ship motions and resistance in waves is verified and validated systematically by comparing the kcs model test data with the numerical calculation the results showed that the reliability and accuracy of the numerical model in terms of studying added resistance problems only the wavelength is around the ship length the calculated added resistance coefficient is slight lower than experiment results this part of results may need to be modified by experiment data three different mesh systems were compared and the mesh numbers have little influence on the results the medium mesh systems were applied in calculation of prv and other two conventional ships for a wide range of wave conditions at the design speed this paper explains the effects of ship type ship speed wave steepness on added resistance of the prv it will provide a reference for the performance analysis and design of the prv usually the peak value of added resistance occurs at wavelength slightly larger than the length of vessels when wavelength goes up or down the added resistance will decrease the block coefficient of prv falls in between tanker and containership the wave length ship length ratio of maximum added resistance equals 1 2 besides the body of prv is full we can speculate that the lack of bulbous bow on wave resistance will make the wave length ship length ratio bigger the ice breaking bow form will have adverse effect on added resistance from the perspective of ship motions the non dimensional amplitudes of heave and pitch motion of the prv increase gradually the non dimensional amplitudes of heave of prv is lower than the other three ships which means the heave motion of prv in waves is not as obvious as conventional ships with the speed up only the added resistance coefficient where the wavelength is around the ship length will rise obviously for kcs and prv and correspondingly the non dimensional amplitudes of heave and pitch motion of the prv have little impact in the other range of wavelength the added resistance coefficient increases slightly when the wave amplitude changes heave and pitch motion of prv varies linearly however the added resistance coefficient doesn t have the same quadratic relationship as conventional ship credit authorship

vessel is input coordinate system and initial position of the ship are defined the wave type 5th order stokes wave is selected wave parameters including wave height wavelength incidence angle and initial phase etc are given quality attributes of the ship design speed and fluid density are defined then the constraint condition is determined the hull surface and the free surface are treated by meshing subdivision finally the solution conditions are set which include the largest number of iterations the time step and the initial free surface wave 3 2 test models and wave conditions to investigate the phenomenon of added resistance three conventional ship types are compared with prv the added resistance of the medium size moeri tanker kvlcc2 s175 containership and kcs containership are performed in this paper prv can accomplish multiple missions including oceanography scientific investigation and polar research prv is equipped with two azimuth thrusters at stern and the aftbody will appear a flat bottom instead of a whole streamline aftbody they offer a superb maneuvering capability but the shapes of their aftbody are different prv used a spoon icebreaking bow which means it is full bow form the center of buoyancy is rather far forward relative to non prvs the station of maximum beam is usually well forward of amidships and entrance angles are quite large this full forebody characteristic may affect the seakeeping performance and lead to the increasing of open water resistance fig 1 presents the ship models and table 1 describes the particulars of the investigated ships in general l b is minimum in four ships and the block coefficient cb is second only to kvlcc2 in the numerical simulations the origin of the ship fixed reference frame is located at its center of gravity cog the inertial frame of reference is located at the waterline in the fore perpendicular in this study the naked hull that is not equipped with bilge keels shaft brackets and rudders all ships were studied in model scale to obtain the best comparability with experimental results by avoiding scaling effects table 2 shows the wave conditions corresponding to the four ships and they will be transformed to the model scale 3 3 added resistance calculation the resistance of the selected ship has been calculated in calm water and waves the average added resistance due to waves r aw is obtained by eq 22 22 r a w r w r c where r w and r c are total resistance in waves and resistance in calm water respectively the calculation formula of transfer function of non dimensional added resistance is expressed as 23 r a w r a w ρ g ζ 2 b 2 l p p where r aw is added resistance in regular waves ρ is the density g is the acceleration of gravity ζ is the wave amplitude of regular waves b is the water line beam lpp is the length between perpendiculars for comparison s sake non dimensional amplitudes are plotted against the non dimensional wave frequency ω defined as follows 24 ω l p p λ the non dimensional amplitude of heave and pitch motions are expressed as 25 c z z a ζ a 26 c θ θ a k ζ a 27 k 360 λ ζ a is the wave amplitude of regular waves and equals half of the wave height z a and θ a is the average amplitude of heave and pitch motion c z and c θ is the corresponding non dimensional heave and pitch motion 3 4 configuration in nonlinear unsteady potential flow method calculations half of the ship s hull under the still water level is modelled using quadratic panels while 8 panels per wavelength as the maximum length of each panel are used for the highest encounter frequency a right handed coordinate system x y z used in the gothenburg 2010 workshop is adopted here the numerical and experimental results are all transferred into this coordinate for comparison and analysis as a rule vessel headings are specified as the direction in which the vessel v x axis is pointing relative to global axes directions for waves are specified by giving the direction in which the wave is progressing wave direction equals 180 meaning that the wave propagates in the opposite direction of the ship heading one regular wave based on 5th order stokes wave theory will be used the wave form is determined by a wave height and a wave length the phase of the wave is set as zero meaning that a wave peak coincides with lpp 2 at time zero the wave direction is 180 meaning that the wave propagates in the opposite direction of the ship heading moreover the simulation will continue until the ship has encountered 1 wave normally a recommended number of wave encounters are 12 the calculations are done for surface domain of one ship length upstream two ship lengths downstream the width of the free surface is one ship length fig 2 shows the example of kcs in medium mesh the body and free surface is meshed using 23604 bem panels 3 5 verification good validation data is essential when testing nonlinear potential flow method there are large amounts of experimental and computed results available kcs containership was chosen as an example the experimental data of kcs container in this thesis is mainly from tokyo 2015 workshop national maritime research institute 2015 kcs is a modern container ship with bulb bow and stern developed by moeri and used as an example hull in this research the comparison was wave added resistance coefficient heave and pitch motion in order to eliminate the influence of scale effect the scale ship model is used in the calculation as in the experiment three different mesh systems are used for calculating added resistance the coarse mesh comprised about 10497 meshes the medium mesh about 23604 meshes the fine mesh about 43888 meshes for fn 0 26 the total calm water resistance is 51 136 n the coefficient is 3 794e 2 deviates by 1 07 from the model test results table 3 shows the calm water resistance and motions compared with the experiment the wave conditions and parameters set in the software are consistent with the experimental configuration fig 3 and fig 4 shows the computed wave added resistance coefficients and vertical motions compared with the experimental results the nonlinear potential method provides a satisfactory result fig 5 shows the comparison of wave contour in calm water and in waves for the kcs containership for three different mesh systems obviously the ship induced wave pattern is more pronounced in waves the difference can be found near the ship surface of the shoulder region in the presence of incident wave wave patterns of three mesh systems are very similar to each other in wave conditions the finest case shows slightly higher wave elevation than the other cases it increases the added resistance as shown in fig 3 cause the waterline integration of the wave elevation is a dominant component of the added resistance considering the time consuming and results accuracy of different mesh settings medium mesh system is used in the following calculations to reduce uncertainties related to discretization errors all computations were performed on the same mesh using the same numerical settings 4 analysis of calculation results figs 6 7 presents the time histories of computed longitudinal force for the four investigated ships advancing at constant forward speed in short and long regular head waves it could be seen nonlinearities of longitudinal force for the prv it is this ship that is characterized by higher bow flare angles 4 1 results of added resistance experimental results of added resistance are useful to understand the characteristics and validate the results of numerical analysis the comparison data of kvlcc2 tanker is mainly from the gothenburg 2010 workshop on ship hydrodynamics larsson et al 2013 added resistances on a s175 containership were measured by fujii and takahashi fujii 1975 nakamura and naito nakamura and naito 1977 and fonseca and soares fonseca and guedessoares 2004 the comparable normalized added resistance coefficient in regular head waves shown in fig 8 as plots of the tanker and containerships demonstrates here also the generally favorable agreement between computations and measurements zakaria and baree 2007 have discussed the variation of added resistance caused by the block coefficient cb the added resistance increases with the cb increased when series 60 hull block coefficient is from 0 6 to 0 8 ship with larger cb usually have larger added resistance and peak value of added resistance will move into the longer wave because the larger cb reduce the natural frequencies of heave and pitch fig 9 compares the added resistance coefficients of the four investigated ships at similar froude numbers unlike the other three ships the prv does not have a bulbous bow however the hull is quite full and the block coefficient is large sort by the block coefficient in order are kvlcc2 tanker prv kcs and s175 containership for the tanker and containerships the peak value of added resistance coefficient is about λ lpp 1 1 although the block coefficient of prv is samller than kvlcc2 the wave length ship length ration of peak value of added resistance coefficient tends to longer wave and is about 1 2 this is probably because lack of bulbous bow to reduce wave resistance which is the main components of added resistance many other model tests on added resistance have been conducted since 1970s park and lee 2019 the added resistance experiments in the head sea conditions based on the literature information available has been summarized fig 10 showed the added resistance coefficient compared with prv s it can be seen that added resistance coefficient of the prv is still higher than these data significantly in both long waves and short waves thus the overall wave resistance in head seas the maximum value of added resistance occurs at wavelengths slightly larger than the length of the vessel as the wavelength increases the added resistance decreases and almost disappears when wavelength is double of the ship length as the wavelength decreases the added resistance decreases and tends to a stable value it may show the trend of added resistance coefficient under typical sea condition at design speed 4 2 effects of heave and pitch motions on added resistance in waves added resistance is closely related to the vertical motions accurate prediction of motions was required as shown in fig 11 overall tendencies of the heave and pitch motions are similar to each other and show good agreement with experimental data in the above wavelength range the unexpected deviation between the calculated vertical motion and the measured vertical motion cannot be explained which may be caused by the uncertainty related to the measured vertical motion in the conventional ships the maximum value of non dimensional amplitudes of heave and pitch motion is slightly shifted towards to longer waves for the tanker because the hull of tanker is blunter than containership although block coefficient of prv is lower than that of tanker the maximum value of the response operator tends to long wave 4 3 effects of ship speed on added resistance in waves claus d simonsen simonsen et al 2013 compared the vertical motion and added resistance of kcs containership under three speeds the results showed that maximum vertical response and added resistance occurred at maximum speed the peak value of added resistance will move to longer wave as speed increases to investigate the effects of ship speed on the vertical motion and added resistance computation was conducted at various forward speeds albeit only for the containership and the prv for the prv computations were performed at full scale speeds of 15 and 16 5 knots corresponding to froude numbers of 0 205 and 0 225 respectively for the kcs containership at 20 and 24 knots corresponding to froude number of 0 21 and 0 26 respectively the comparative non dimensional amplitudes of added resistance and heave and pitch motions are shown in fig 12 and fig 13 as expected the added resistance in waves is more at higher ship speeds for kcs and prv in the range of wave length equal to ship length the added resistance in waves are noticeably increasing heave motions are distinctly in long waves less at slower ship speeds pitch motions are nearly unaffected by ship speed 4 4 effects of wave steepness on added resistance in waves until now we assumed that added resistance in waves is the second order quantity in the wave amplitude journee 1976 different from added resistance motions change linearly however ships operate in waves of variable steepness thus the question arose in what way this assumption is valid to resolve this issue we computed the added resistance in waves for the vessels in waves of different steepness here defined as wave height divided by the ship length the non dimensional amplitudes of heave and pitch motion of kvlcc2 and prv are almost the same under two different wave steepness as shown in fig 14 that is the relationship between ship motion and wave amplitude is linear it can be found in fig 15 that the added resistance coefficient of kvlcc2 is approximate equivalent it accords with the quadratic correlation between added resistance and wave amplitude however added resistance of prv doesn t show a good quadratic relationship 5 conclusion the feasibility of the three dimensional full nonlinear time domain potential flow theory in the calculation of ship motions and resistance in waves is verified and validated systematically by comparing the kcs model test data with the numerical calculation the results showed that the reliability and accuracy of the numerical model in terms of studying added resistance problems only the wavelength is around the ship length the calculated added resistance coefficient is slight lower than experiment results this part of results may need to be modified by experiment data three different mesh systems were compared and the mesh numbers have little influence on the results the medium mesh systems were applied in calculation of prv and other two conventional ships for a wide range of wave conditions at the design speed this paper explains the effects of ship type ship speed wave steepness on added resistance of the prv it will provide a reference for the performance analysis and design of the prv usually the peak value of added resistance occurs at wavelength slightly larger than the length of vessels when wavelength goes up or down the added resistance will decrease the block coefficient of prv falls in between tanker and containership the wave length ship length ratio of maximum added resistance equals 1 2 besides the body of prv is full we can speculate that the lack of bulbous bow on wave resistance will make the wave length ship length ratio bigger the ice breaking bow form will have adverse effect on added resistance from the perspective of ship motions the non dimensional amplitudes of heave and pitch motion of the prv increase gradually the non dimensional amplitudes of heave of prv is lower than the other three ships which means the heave motion of prv in waves is not as obvious as conventional ships with the speed up only the added resistance coefficient where the wavelength is around the ship length will rise obviously for kcs and prv and correspondingly the non dimensional amplitudes of heave and pitch motion of the prv have little impact in the other range of wavelength the added resistance coefficient increases slightly when the wave amplitude changes heave and pitch motion of prv varies linearly however the added resistance coefficient doesn t have the same quadratic relationship as conventional ship credit authorship

frequency domain time domain 1 introduction vlfs very large floating structure plays an important role in the development and utilization of ocean resources so the problem of load and response of vlfs becomes an important research hotspot in the world due to its huge dimensions generally vlfs has to be made up of many structural modules because vlfs has very large dimensions large floating structure is applied for integrative replenishment base and platform it is used for aircraft taking off and landing fuel oil replenishment logistical support and sea sightseeing watanabe et al 2006 proposed the concept of large floating structure which provide a marine replenishment for the aircrafts flying atlantic suzuki et al 2017 introduced box floating structure mega float which is early vlfs for airfield or container dock kansai international airport realized to apply vlfs to be runways in japan semisubmersible vlfs is used in first stage and box typed vlfs is applied in second stage suzuki 2005 rognaas et al 2001 proposed a mob mobile offshore base which is semisubmersible large floating structure for airfield mob is a typical semisubmersible vlfs and it is also connected by multi modulus to provide runways and to replenishment in ocean table 1 0 lists a number of famous vlfss built in the world most vlfss are used to be airport so that it is slender type heteroclite vlfs has not been proposed and built rigid connector is a kind of common connecting means of large floating structures it includes rmrc rigid module rigid connector and fmrc flexible module rigid connector ochi et al ochi and namseeg 1991 proposed numerical rmrc model wave pressure and mob motion is deduced at the basis of rmrc model so that the shearing force and bending moment are obtained at any section of mob then loads of connector is solved wang 2019 proposed a rmrc hexagon enclosed platform and a model test is performed to measure loads responses at connector section numerical simulation combining bem boundary element method and fem finite element method is calculated then calculation results and test results are compared kim et al 1999 think that fmrc model has better effect on calculating loads of connector three models involving fmrc rmfc rigid module flexible connector and rmrc are used to compare their linear hydroelastic responses tank model experiment is a feasible means to study the load and response of large floating structure okubo et al okubo 1996 carried out a model test to study the load characteristics of connector of large floating structure fixed at 2 bars in tank yago et al yago and hara 1996 yago and endo 1996a performed multi bodies vlfs model test in which rigid and flexible connectors are applied lv et al 2004a performed a hydrodynamic model test study of semisubmersible multi bodies of vlfs which was connected by three flexible connectors wave height wave angle and stiffness of connector were changed and analysed the effect on section loads of connectors wu and li wu et al 2016 li et al 2017 carried out a number of model tests of large floating structure near islands and reefs these test results remained to be improving the numerical methods for study of connector load yago and endo 1996b performed hydroelastic model test of multi vlfs which rigid connector and hinged connector were used to study the loads at connectors chen 2003 and lv et al 2004b had done hydroelastic model test of box section vlfs vertical displacement is measured wan et al wan 2014 conducted hydroelastic model test of vlfs in water of several depths test results were compared with numerical computations wu et al ding et al 2015 li et al 2016 wu et al 2017a performed a model test of vlfs connected by mulit body in ocean near islands and reefs song et al song 2012 studied a vlfsob very large floating structure ocean base model experiment to obtain its structural responses in tank waves it is stated that most vlfss are slender floating structures by making a general survey while enclosed type vlfs in which modulus are connected end by end has not been studied yet 3d 3 dimensional hydroelasticity is most important evaluation theory to study structural responses of ocean structures in waves bishop and price 1979 proposed hydroelasticity theory by using potential theory and mode superposition method to study linear hydroelastic response of 2d 2 dimensional ship structure in 1979 wu et al wu 1984 developed the 3d hydroelasticity by using 3d fem to study frequency domain hydroelastic response of ship in 1980s most of the hydroelastic analysis methods of vlfs can be divided into modal analysis method and direct method modal analysis is widely used because it can greatly reduce the number of degrees of freedom ohkusu et al ohkusu and namba 1996 used hydroelasticity to consider diffraction and radiation dry modes are supeposited to obtain structural deformation hamamoto et al hamamoto and sekine 2000 used the wet mode method to study and gave a simplified formula for calculating the additional mass of any plate in 1994 mamidipudi et al mamidipudi and webster 1994 firstly applied the direct method to study the hydroelastic calculation of vlfs and they directly solved the coupled hydroelastic equations by using the central finite difference method malenica et al 2009 studied the problem of ship modelling under elastic vibration and springing responses of linear wave hydroelasticity has been successfully applied to evaluate the hydroelastic response of ship structure including springing and whipping response and the springing response of vlfs structure so hydroelasticity combining potential theory and fem is expected to calculate the hydroelastic response of a hexagon enclosed platform hep in this paper vlfs usually has a large horizontal dimensions and small depth size so that its overall stiffness is flexible and hydroelastic response is significant such as springing and whipping 3d hydroelasticity and model test both are two common approaches to study structural responses of vlfs in waves a hexagon enclosed platform hep which provides life accommodation ship docking and marine replenishment for many ocean going vessels in deep ocean need to be designed the hep has large dimensions so that it is classified to vlfs it is necessary to evaluate structural response of vlfs for design of vlfs model experiment and 3d hydroelasticity numerical method are both common means to evaluate the structural response yago and endo 1996b chen 2003 lv et al 2004b wan 2014 ding et al 2015 li et al 2016 wu et al 2017a song 2012 a number of vlfss are studied by model tests and simulations in the world most of vlfss are of slender floating structures watanabe et al 2006 suzuki et al 2017 suzuki 2005 rognaas et al 2001 ochi and namseeg 1991 wang 2019 kim et al 1999 okubo 1996 yago and hara 1996 yago and endo 1996a 1996b lv et al 2004a 2004b wu et al 2016 2017a li et al 2016 2017 chen 2003 wan 2014 ding et al 2015 song 2012 however heteromorphic shape vlfs has not been designed and not been used in ocean so far heteromorphic shape vlfs is very different from slender vlfs so that heteromorphic shape vlfs has special load and response characteristic it is necessary to carry out experimental and numerical research on load and structural response for those heteromorphic shape vlfs if heteromorphic shape vlfs is designed the usage of ocean supporting platform requires a kind of heteromorphic shape vlfs for docking serval ships and well structural stability traditional slender vlfs is not fit for ocean supporting platform a hexagon type platform is proposed to be an alternative for ocean supporting platform wu et al 2017b the hep is of structural stability because it is made up of six single modules end by end a large moon pool provides a safe sheltering water area therefore a conception structure of hep which is made up of six trapezoidal floating structures connected by six rigid connectors and provides life accommodation ship docking and marine replenishment for many ocean going vessels at open sea is designed in original hep design fmrc hep and fmfc hep are both designed fmrc hep means that six modules are connected by six rigid connector so that no large rotation between modules fmfc hep implicates that six hinged connectors connect six modules so the rotations about common edges are allowed in fmfc hep fmfc hep induces complex multi body interaction therefore fmrc hep and fmfc hep has significant structural responses difference we both carry out researches on structural response of fmrc hep and fmfc hep the structural responses of fmrc hep and fmfc hep have to be discussed in two papers due to large amount of studying results this paper studies structural response of fmrc hep by means of experiment and numerical hydroelasticity another paper focuses on structural response of fmfc hep which is still compared to fmrc hep s only by using experiment method weiqin et al 2020 although these two papers both study hep connecting means and studying methods are different this paper studies the load and structural response of fmrc flexible module rigid connectors hexagon enclosed platform hep by means of model test and numerical investigation this paper proposes an experimental methodology to measure the load and structural response and applies numerical hydroelasticity method to evaluate hydroelastic response for heteromorphic shape hep scaled model of fmrc hep is designed and fabricated then the model experiment is carried out in wave tank a number of experimental results are measured and obtained 3d hydroelastic code homer is used to evaluate elastic response of hep model tested the model experiment numerical results and experimental results are compared and verified to analyse the structural response mechanism of fmrc hexagon enclosed platform in this paper structural response mechanism of a fmrc hexagon enclosed platform is studied and obtained by model experiment and numerical investigation to guide structural design of hexagon enclosed platform and to provide design and evaluation reference for other enclosed ocean platforms 2 structural design of hep model a hep hexagon enclosed platform provides life accommodation ship docking and marine replenishment for many ocean going vessels in far ocean the hexagon enclosed platform is made up of six trapezoidal floating structures connected by six rigid connectors as fig 1 shown all single structural modules will be built and dragged to match at service sea as fig 1 shown the outsides and insides are used to dock for ocean going vessels there is a large moon pool in the centre of hep so the enclosed kind of platform can withstand out waves to be an artificial sheltered harbour outside edges of hep can be used to short term docking for ships inside edges of hep can be used when long term docking or heave sea hep can dock 3 or 4 ocean going vessels at most this platform can provide life accommodation ship docking ship maintenance and marine replenishment large life space can provide life recreation and medical treatment for people as fig 1 shown hep has six single modules which are connected end by end there are one life modulus for people life four operation modules for ship docking ship maintenance and marine replenishment and one gate modulus which equips thrusters to drift when ships are passing in and out hep has the characteristics of mat type structure which horizontal dimensions are large and moulded depth is small so hydroelastic response of hep is significant in this paper experiment model is designed from conceptual structure of hep the model experiment of hep is used to study the structural responses mechanism of hep structure in waves it is a feasible means to study the characteristics of structural response of hep structure by means of model experiment due to low cost and suitable size model experiment of fmrc hep is used to measure strain histories to analyse structural mechanism of hep structure therefore the experiment model of hep is elastic but rigid the stiffness of design model of hep is determined based on a similarity theory which is used by chen et al 2003 for model design of a vlfs the experimental model and real hep must satisfy geometrical similarity and hydrodynamic similarity and structural similarity are both satisfied if they are of hydroelastic similarity geometrical similarity means that structural scale size deformation wave length and wave height should satisfy eq 1 1 l r l m λ where l is scale dimension λ is scaled ratio r means conceptual structure m denotes experiment model hydrodynamic similarity considers the effect of free surface and gravity so that froude number should be equal between experiment model and conceptual structure wave is an unsteady flows and has periodic motion so that strouhal number should be equal for ocean wave and tank wave the hydrodynamic similarity should satisfy eq 2 lin et al 1991 2 v r g r l r v m g m l m l r v r t r l m v m t m where v is velocity t is wave period and g is acceleration of gravity structural similarity requires the ratio of real structure deflection to scaled model deflection being equal to the scaled ratio λ as eq 3 3 w r w m λ q r l r 3 e r i r λ q m l m 3 e m i m where w is deflection of structure q is distribution load the loads of real structure and scaled model is three power of scaled ratio so stiffness of real structure and scaled model is obtained as eq 4 yu et al 1991 4 e r i r e m i m λ 5 according to above hydroelastic similarities involving geometrical similarity hydrodynamic similarity and structural similarity the design model of hep is designed the scale ratio between conceptual structure and experiment model of hep is determined to 100 in the case of considering wall boundary effect and wave tank dimensions so the dimensions of experiment model is presented in table 2 six trapezoidal modules is fabricated respectively and then they are matched by using rigid connector to form hexagonal shape as fig 2 a shows hydrodynamic similarity is used to determine wave case structural similarity is used to guide the structural design of experiment model the experiment model should be elastic to be measured for strain information therefore two layer structure is used for experiment model of hep as fig 2 b shows upper layer is steel plate which provides stiffness and strength and it can be measured by strain gage under layer is waterproof foam material with low hardness which can provide buoyancy and initial stiffness steel plate and foam layer are clung by super glue to constitute a single modulus the thickness of steel plate is determined 0 5 mm to make sure the stiffness of a single module should satisfy eq 4 as table 2 0 gives according to design of conceptual structure of hep where six rigid connectors are used so rigid connection is simulated in experiment model rigid connector of experiment model is designed as fig 2 c presents box irons are inserted bush on each short edge of single module box iron and single module are both drilled same holes where bolts are fasten so that the rigid connection is obtained in experiment model additional cylinder irons are distributed uniformly on model plate on the basis of weight of conceptual structure to obtain design draft as fig 2 a shows 3 experimental and numerical methodologies of 3d hydroelastic response of hep model considering possible 3d hydroelastic response of real hep structure in ocean waves a tank experiment is carried out to test hydroelastic response of hep model and 3d hydroelastic theory is used to calculate the hydroelastic responses by using a 3d hydroelastic system homer which combines hydrodynamics code bem and structural dynamics code fem experimental and numerical methodologies are both used to analyse the hydroelastic mechanism of hep model 3 1 experimental methodology of hep model the experiment of hep model is carried out in the wave tank of wut wuhan university of technology as shown in fig 3 main dimensions of the wave tank is 132m 10 8m 2m the depth is able to be adjusted regular waves irregular wave and freak waves can be made by a flap type wave maker high precision wave gauge is used to measure wave elevation and non contact motion capturing system is used to test model motion structural responses of hep is studying objective in this paper dynamic strain signals are collected to analyse the structural responses of hep modulus number of six modules is determined the 3 adjacent modules are arranged 4 strain gages in each while another 3 modules are arranged 1 strain gage in each to verify symmetry of the model 15 strain gages are arranged on steel plate of experiment model as fig 4 shows two wave gages is placed before hep to test wave elevation all gages are connected to a acquisition instrument which has 32 channels and sample frequency is 500 hz all experimental devices are presented in table 3 the hydroelastic model test of hep is carried out in a large towing and wave tank in which length is 132m width is 10 8m and water depth is 4m in wuhan university of technology maximum wave height reaches 0 4m wave gauge is used to record dynamic wave elevation in the experiment this experiment is carried out in a towing tank equipped a wave maker so the wave tank is long and wide enough and a wave maker is located at its one of end one wave direction from wave maker to another end of tank is obtained in the tank wave tank is divided into wave making area testing area and wave absorbing area and hep model is placed in testing area as fig 5 shows wave making area is used to make waves testing area is located at 20m from wave maker hep model is floating blow tow truck where strain lines are passed through and sensor information are gathered wave absorbing area is end of wave tank which absorbs waves to avoid large reflected waves in order to obtain two wave angles 0 and 30 as fig 4 shows the hep model arrangement is changed as fig 6 illustrates several light and slender mooring lines are fasten between model angles and towing rails tank width is much larger than width of hep model so that tank wall effect is avoided two wave angles 0 and 30 are tested due to symmetry of the model the common edge of no 1 and no 6 modulus is normal to wave maker in the case of 0 as fig 6 a while the long edge of no 6 modulus is face to wave maker in the case of 30 as fig 6 b shows 48 wave cases are made to measure hydroelastic response of hep model in the experiment 24 cases are used to perform the tank experiments for 0 incoming wave and another 24 cases are used to carry out the tank experiment for 30 incoming wave in each wave angle arrangement 21 wave case are used to change wave length from 0 6m to 6m 4 wave cases are used to change wave height from 0 035m to 0 06m in the experiment mooring lines is in a relax statement mooring lines are used to restrain model horizontal drift motion and 1st order motions of model are not restricted 3 2 numerical methodology of 3d hydroelastic simulation the general methodology for hydroelastic ship beam model is rather well known and the first developments can be attributed to bishop price bishop and price 1979 3d hydroelastic theory is proposed by wu by combining 3d bem and 3d fem wu 1984 then 3d hydroelastic theory is widely applied for ship engineering especially 3d hydroelasticity is most important evaluating theory to study structural responses of vlfs in waves because vlfs has large horizontal dimensions and low overall stiffness in contrast to the well known rigid body seakeeping model the 3d hydroelastic theory basically extends the motion representation with the additional modals of motion deformation chosen as a series of the wet structural natural modals structural responses of large floating structure is linear if it has small motion and elastic deformation in waves so the displacement h x y z of floating structure involving motion and deformation is expressed by mode superposition method 5 h x y z i 1 n ξ i t h i x y z i 1 n ξ i t h x i x y z i h y i x y z j h z i x y z k where h i x y z denotes the general motion deformation modal which can be either rigid or elastic the above decomposition leads to the additional radiation boundary value problems bvp for elastic modes with the following change in the body boundary condition n is total modal number including rigid modal number and flexible modal number and rigid modal number is 6 which represents 6 degree of freedom of rigid motion and n 6 is flexible modal number the displacement h x y z of floating structure is solved by a quadratic partial differential equation 6 a a h b b h c c h f where a b c are generalized structural mass matrix damping matrix and stiffness matrix a b c are generalized added mass matrix wave damping matrix and restoring force matrix f are generalized wave forces when eq 5 is substituted to eq 6 to transform the solving the variable h to ξ structural response of large floating structure can be solved on the basis of modal superposition in waves dynamic structural code nastran is used to solve stress as 7 σ x x y z r 1 m ξ r σ x r where m is the flexible modal number m n 6 coupled dynamic equation eq 6 in frequency domain can be written as follows 8 ω e 2 m a i ω e b k c ξ f d i where m is modal genuine mass k is modal structural stiffness a is hydrodynamic added mass b is hydrodynamic damping c is hydrostatic stiffness ξ is modal amplitudes f d i is wave excitation force which is solved by the sum of integral force of incident wave velocity potential and diffraction potential on ship wet surface as eq 9 9 f d i f f k f d i ω ρ s b φ i φ d n i d s elements of added mass a and hydrodynamic damping b are obtained by integral of radiation potential as eq 10 and eq 11 10 a i j ρ re s b ϕ r j h i n d s 11 b i j ρ ω e im s b ϕ r j h i n d s diffraction potential and radiation potential can be solved by bem or method of sources as eq 12 12 ϕ s b σ x h g x h x s d s where σ x h is source function hydrodynamic code hydrostar is introduced to solve above hydrodynamic coefficients and potentials in order to simulate the dynamic response it is necessary to move to the time domain this will be performed using a procedure proposed by cummins lin et al 1991 rewrite the time domain equivalent of the motion equation as eq 13 13 m a ξ t k c ξ t 0 t k t τ ξ τ d τ f d i t q t where a is infinite frequency added mass matrix k t is matrix of impulse response functions impulse response functions can be calculated from the frequency dependent damping coefficients as eq 14 14 k i j t 2 π 0 b i j ω cos ω t d w a 3d hydroelastic analysis platform homer combining a structural solver nastran and hydrodynamic solver hydrostar is used to analyse 3d elastic response of hep experiment model the hydroelastic code homer is developed by bureau veritas up to now homer is used to solve 3d hydroelastic response of large ship and ocean structures in some studies malenica et al 2003 2008 tuitman and malenica 2009 the sachem of homer is given in fig 7 structural solver and hydrodynamic solver calculate independently but homer uses their computational results to couple hydroelastic responses fem model of hep considering balance weight distribution and structural weight as fig 8 hydrodynamic model is given as fig 9 shows origin of coordinates is determined at center point on structural bottom surface in two models in fem model mass point elements are arranged on corresponding locations on plate of hep to simulate the additional cylinder irons rigid many point contraction mpc is used to connect all modules 160428 elements are meshed in the fem model 2032 bem panels are meshed on wet surface of hep for calculating wave load and structure motion in hydrodynamic model homer uses the two models to calculate the 3d structural responses of hep considering hydroelastic effect in this numerical study it is spent about 0 5 h for a frequency domain case and it takes about 6 h for a time domain case 3 3 analysis of modal and frequency domain stress rao according to the experimental programme 50 wave cases are performed in tank waves stress from strain gauge are obtained at each stress points therefore a number of time domain strain histories are recorded and transformed to analyse frequency domain stress rao response amplitude operator in this study a number of frequency domain stress raos including experimental results and numerical results are obtained experimental results are obtained in the hydroelastic model experiment of hep and numerical results are calculated by means of 3d hydroelastic solver homer a number of stress points are selected to analyse frequency domain structural response based on all experimental and numerical results with changing wave frequency wave height and wave angle 4 1 modal analysis of hep model 3d hydroelastic response is obtained on the basis of modal superposition method so that the first 9 modals are analysed as fig 10 shows in modal analysis the arranging angle of hep model is the 0 position as shown in fig 4 it is indicated from fig 10 that hep model has significant local modal local modal appears each single modulus it is analysed that hep has wide horizontal area and short depth its overall stiffness is relative small and the stiffness in all directions of horizontal plane is close so that the modal characteristic of hep is very different from ship type structure the first 9 dry wet frequencies for flexible modal is given in table 4 0 it is seem that wet frequencies are closer it means that their springing responses are possible to be induced in these wave cases which wave frequencies are close to the wet frequencies therefore the first 9 flexible modals are used to superpose to calculate hydroelastic responses of hep in numerical investigation 4 2 analysis of linearity and symmetry of stress points experiment and numerical results need to be verify their availability by means of studying linearity of data and symmetry of stress points 4 wave cases changing wave height are carried out to check experimental linearity as figs 11 and 8 of all wave cases are used to study the linearity experimental results wave parameters of the 8 wave cases are presented in tables 5 0 and 4 wave cases are used for wave angle 0 while another 4 wave cases are studied for wave angle 30 each 4 wave cases changes the wave height from 0 035m to 0 06m while wave lengths and periods are same fig 11 a presents stress linearity of stress points by changing wave height at wave angle 0 and fig 11 b gives stress of points by changing wave height at wave angle 30 they are manifested that the experimental results have evident linearity so that research data are of confidence level experiment and numerical results of symmetrical stress points on hep model are discussed to determine the availability of data fig 12 a shows stress raos of no 1 and 15 point at wave angle 0 it implies that no 1 and no 15 point which are symmetrical at wave angle 0 have very close values so that the data availability is acceptable fig 12 b shows stress raos of no 1 and 14 point at wave angle 30 it shows that no 1 and no 14 point have very close values so fig 12 also verifies the symmetry of stress points fig 12 verifies the symmetry of stress points so that stress values are believable including experiment and numerical calculation 4 3 analysis of effect of wave angle on structural responses effects of two wave angles such as 0 and 30 shown in fig 4 on stress response are studied in this paper as fig 4 shows no 1 no 5 and no 9 point are located at centre points on deck plane of no 1 no 2 and no 3 modulus the experimental and numerical results of no 1 no 5 and no 9 point are analysed and compared stress raos of no 1 no 5 and no 9 point are shown at wave angle 0 and 30 fig 13 presents stress raos of no 1 5 and 9 point at wave angle 0 and 30 fig 13 a shows stress raos of no 1 point by changing wave angle 0 and 30 it is found that no 1 point or no 1 modulus has larger stress level at wave angle 30 because it is analysed that no 1 point is closer to mid hep at wave angle 30 fig 13 b presents stress raos of no 5 point by changing wave angle 0 and 30 stress of no 5 represents the strength level of no 2 modulus it is shown that no 2 modulus has a little higher stress at stage of low frequency at wave angle 0 where no 5 point is located at mid hep section while no 5 point doesn t locate at mid hep any more at wave angle 30 fig 13 c shows stress raos of no 9 point it denotes that no 3 modulus has higher stress at stage of low frequency at wave angle 0 because no 9 point is close to mid hep section at wave angle 0 while long edge of no 3 modulus is perpendicular to wave direction at wave angle 30 hexagon shape of hep doesn t have simple effect to determine which wave angle is serious 4 4 analysis of stress distribution between modules stress raos of stress points is analysed to study structural stress distribution of hep as fig 5 shows no 1 is heading to wave firstly no 2 modulus is middle modulus of hep and no 3 modulus is end of hep model while hep model is ahead at wave angle 0 the strength of no 1 no 2 and no 3 modulus is studied by discussing on no 1 no 5 and no 9 stress point because they respectively locate at centre point of no 1 and no 2 and no 3 modulus fig 14 a demonstrates stress raos of no 1 5 and 9 point at wave angle 0 it indicates that no 2 has higher stress because it is located at middle part at the angle 0 when hep model is ahead to wave angle 30 long edge of no 6 modulus with a centre stress point no 15 is perpendicular to wave direction and no 1 modulus and no 2 modulus are symmetrical around middle section of hep therefore stress of no 1 5 and 15 point is discussed at wave angle 30 fig 14 b shows stress raos of no 1 5 and 9 point at wave angle 30 it manifests that no 1 modulus and no 2 modulus has close results while no 6 has low amplitude stress because no 1 modulus and no 2 modulus is symmetrical about a a axis shown in fig 4 and no 6 modulus is located the end side of hep at the wave angle 30 5 analysis of time domain stress histories a number of wave cases are carried out to obtain the frequency domain stress results 4 typical time domain wave cases are selected to analyse time domain structural features of hep model the parameters of wave cases are presented in table 6 0 case 1 2 are posited in wave angle 0 and case 3 4 are faced to wave angle 30 with changing wave periods two wave periods which reflect typical structural features at intermediate and high frequency are discussed in the paper in this experiment it is seem that elastic hep model has resonant vibration responses so it is necessary to determine the hydroelastic characteristic of hep model by analysing time domain stress histories and then transfer them to spectrum curves fig 15 shows the time domain stress histories of stress point no 5 involving numerical calculation and experiment at wave angle 0 a denotes case 1 b shows case 2 c gives case 3 and d presents case 4 it is obvious from fig 15 that time domain numerical results and experimental results have good agreement it is indicated that the 3d hydroelastic numerical simulation method is applicable for evaluating hydroelastic responses of hep model in this experiment case 2 was carried out three times to study repeatability of experiment so the availability of the experiment is determined the time domain histories of no 5 point of case 2 are shown in fig 16 for three repeatable tests it is seen from fig 16 that the time domain histories of three case 2 tests are very close implying that the hep hydroelastic experiment has good repeatability and the experimental results are reliable it is also seen from fig 15 that time domain stress histories of case 1 and case 3 have smooth curves while case 2 and case 4 have significant resonant vibration responses so it is necessary to determine the hydroelastic characteristic of hep model experimental and numerical time domain stress curves are transformed to frequency spectrum curves by means of fourier transformation to analyse the hydroelastic characteristic of hep model fig 17 presents the frequency spectrum curves of case 1 2 3 and 4 it is obvious that these curves have multi peaks and experimental and numerical frequency spectrum curves have similar peak distribution fig 17 a shows that the amplitude of subsequent peaks are very smaller than 1st peak so that the time domain history is smooth it means case 1 has feeble hydroelastic response and wave load plays a major role on structural response of hep model however it is seen that 1st peak frequencies are very equal to wave encountering frequencies the subsequent peak frequencies are very close to double triple and quadruple encountering wave frequencies in fig 15 and 2nd peak frequencies are very close to the 7th wet modal in fig 17 a and c 3rd peak frequencies are very close to the 11th wet modal in fig 17 b and d the subsequent peaks have significant amplitude in fig 17 b d so it indicates that the nonlinear springing response of hep model is generated it is seen from fig 17 that there is certain difference between experiment and time domain numerical calculation it is indicated that nonlinearities are appeared in experiment while 3d hydroelasticity method can t consider nonlinearity it is analysed that the hep model has a large moon pool where internal free surface is nonlinear in experiment in addition hydroelasticity method is based on potential flow theory which can t consider viscidity effect viscidity damping coefficient used in simulation can t simulate complicated viscidity effect happened in experiment the deformation mode of hep model is paid a close attention two moments t1 and t2 of case 1 which reflect hogging and sagging shown in fig 15 a are selected to analyse structural deformation of hep model fig 18 displays structural deformation of hep model of case 1 at t1 and fig 19 shows structural deformation of hep model of case 1 at t2 they are found that simulation and experiment have accordant deformation modes 6 summary 6 1 discussion in this study one can see that the experimental results and the numerical results have good agreements but there are still some discrepancies worth discussing for example it is noticed that numerical results suggest peaks exist at high frequency while the experimental results don t figs 12 14 this is because those high frequency responses are very difficult to perform in the water tank due to the fact that they are close to the wetted frequency table 4 0 another point is that experimental test results demonstrates somewhat higher response range compared with the numerical results figs 15 16 this is because the numerical results are obtained based on linear methods in the laboratory test significant nonlinear effects exist furthermore there is a large moon pool in the center of the hep structure where nonlinearity of the free surface inside is even higher additionally viscous effects such as vortex shedding will affect the accuracy a little bit although it is not very significant in regular wave in short based on our analysis and international towing tank conference ittc procedures ittc committee 2017 there is room to improve the numerical method but the results are quite acceptable compared against the water tank test 6 2 highlight this paper studies the hydroelastic responses of a fmrc hep model by the means of experiment and numerical simulation the fmrc hep model is spliced by 6 trapezoidal modules the hep model is designed to be flexible and the connector is rigid so that its stress and deformation response can be obtained a 3d hydroelastic code homer is used to calculate the numerical response of hep model then a hydroelastic experiment is designed to study the real mechanism of hep model and to verify the effectiveness of simulation based on simulation results and experimental results including frequency domain and time domain it is found that experimental results and numerical results have accordant and close matching it is indicated that the numerical approach is believable and can be popularized to evaluate the structural response of mat type ocean platform and the experimental method is also verified by numerical simulation it is found that the hydroelastic responses of hep model is generated indeed frequency domain raos of stress have multiple significant and close peaks and the time domain stress curves is transformed by fourier transformation to analyse frequency spectrum indicating springing responses is induced so the hydroelastic response should be considered when the platform is designed although hydroelastic response is produced its amplitude is smaller than the responses induced by low frequency wave load on the basis of the characteristics of shape and structure the intermediate modulus of hep along wave direction need to be paid a close attention 0 incident wave has significant response the hexagon enclosed platform model using rigid connectors is studied in this paper the fmrc hep model is studied for its structural safety in waves in this paper designers and authors are expecting that the hep will be put into operation and applied to develop ocean service hep consists of multi modulus so that it has the advantage of fast moving and splicing it is applied in deep ocean it is found from research results that this hexagon enclosed platform is satisfied for the strength evaluation it is verified to play a rule to be several alternatives for ocean platform firstly hep is expected to be multipurpose ocean platform which provides life accommodation ship docking and marine replenishment for many ocean going vessels in deep ocean secondly hep is also expected to be ocean sightseeing platform for docking large luxury liners and cruise ships there are a lot of five star rooms multifunction meeting rooms restaurants entertainment places fishing and scuba diving facilities hep doesn t only becomes sighting and entertainment places combining catering entertainment accommodation business and replenishment but is docking ports for tourist ships thirdly hep is also alternative for a scientific and experiment platform which is used for marine science research ocean environment measure experiment verification and ocean monitoring finally hep is a choose for ship repairing platform too there is a large moon pool that provides well safe sheltering water area for repaired ships and such platform may provide abundant repairing facilities and materials all in all hep provides various options for

20643,hexagon enclosed platform hep provides life accommodation ship docking and marine replenishment for many ocean going vessels in deep ocean the hep is composed of six trapezoidal floating modules

indeed based on research results the research results and conclusions obtained in the paper are used to guide conceputal design of a hep structure keywords experiment hydroelasticity hep fmrc stress frequency domain time domain 1 introduction vlfs very large floating structure plays an important role in the development and utilization of ocean resources so the problem of load and response of vlfs becomes an important research hotspot in the world due to its huge dimensions generally vlfs has to be made up of many structural modules because vlfs has very large dimensions large floating structure is applied for integrative replenishment base and platform it is used for aircraft taking off and landing fuel oil replenishment logistical support and sea sightseeing watanabe et al 2006 proposed the concept of large floating structure which provide a marine replenishment for the aircrafts flying atlantic suzuki et al 2017 introduced box floating structure mega float which is early vlfs for airfield or container dock kansai international airport realized to apply vlfs to be runways in japan semisubmersible vlfs is used in first stage and box typed vlfs is applied in second stage suzuki 2005 rognaas et al 2001 proposed a mob mobile offshore base which is semisubmersible large floating structure for airfield mob is a typical semisubmersible vlfs and it is also connected by multi modulus to provide runways and to replenishment in ocean table 1 0 lists a number of famous vlfss built in the world most vlfss are used to be airport so that it is slender type heteroclite vlfs has not been proposed and built rigid connector is a kind of common connecting means of large floating structures it includes rmrc rigid module rigid connector and fmrc flexible module rigid connector ochi et al ochi and namseeg 1991 proposed numerical rmrc model wave pressure and mob motion is deduced at the basis of rmrc model so that the shearing force and bending moment are obtained at any section of mob then loads of connector is solved wang 2019 proposed a rmrc hexagon enclosed platform and a model test is performed to measure loads responses at connector section numerical simulation combining bem boundary element method and fem finite element method is calculated then calculation results and test results are compared kim et al 1999 think that fmrc model has better effect on calculating loads of connector three models involving fmrc rmfc rigid module flexible connector and rmrc are used to compare their linear hydroelastic responses tank model experiment is a feasible means to study the load and response of large floating structure okubo et al okubo 1996 carried out a model test to study the load characteristics of connector of large floating structure fixed at 2 bars in tank yago et al yago and hara 1996 yago and endo 1996a performed multi bodies vlfs model test in which rigid and flexible connectors are applied lv et al 2004a performed a hydrodynamic model test study of semisubmersible multi bodies of vlfs which was connected by three flexible connectors wave height wave angle and stiffness of connector were changed and analysed the effect on section loads of connectors wu and li wu et al 2016 li et al 2017 carried out a number of model tests of large floating structure near islands and reefs these test results remained to be improving the numerical methods for study of connector load yago and endo 1996b performed hydroelastic model test of multi vlfs which rigid connector and hinged connector were used to study the loads at connectors chen 2003 and lv et al 2004b had done hydroelastic model test of box section vlfs vertical displacement is measured wan et al wan 2014 conducted hydroelastic model test of vlfs in water of several depths test results were compared with numerical computations wu et al ding et al 2015 li et al 2016 wu et al 2017a performed a model test of vlfs connected by mulit body in ocean near islands and reefs song et al song 2012 studied a vlfsob very large floating structure ocean base model experiment to obtain its structural responses in tank waves it is stated that most vlfss are slender floating structures by making a general survey while enclosed type vlfs in which modulus are connected end by end has not been studied yet 3d 3 dimensional hydroelasticity is most important evaluation theory to study structural responses of ocean structures in waves bishop and price 1979 proposed hydroelasticity theory by using potential theory and mode superposition method to study linear hydroelastic response of 2d 2 dimensional ship structure in 1979 wu et al wu 1984 developed the 3d hydroelasticity by using 3d fem to study frequency domain hydroelastic response of ship in 1980s most of the hydroelastic analysis methods of vlfs can be divided into modal analysis method and direct method modal analysis is widely used because it can greatly reduce the number of degrees of freedom ohkusu et al ohkusu and namba 1996 used hydroelasticity to consider diffraction and radiation dry modes are supeposited to obtain structural deformation hamamoto et al hamamoto and sekine 2000 used the wet mode method to study and gave a simplified formula for calculating the additional mass of any plate in 1994 mamidipudi et al mamidipudi and webster 1994 firstly applied the direct method to study the hydroelastic calculation of vlfs and they directly solved the coupled hydroelastic equations by using the central finite difference method malenica et al 2009 studied the problem of ship modelling under elastic vibration and springing responses of linear wave hydroelasticity has been successfully applied to evaluate the hydroelastic response of ship structure including springing and whipping response and the springing response of vlfs structure so hydroelasticity combining potential theory and fem is expected to calculate the hydroelastic response of a hexagon enclosed platform hep in this paper vlfs usually has a large horizontal dimensions and small depth size so that its overall stiffness is flexible and hydroelastic response is significant such as springing and whipping 3d hydroelasticity and model test both are two common approaches to study structural responses of vlfs in waves a hexagon enclosed platform hep which provides life accommodation ship docking and marine replenishment for many ocean going vessels in deep ocean need to be designed the hep has large dimensions so that it is classified to vlfs it is necessary to evaluate structural response of vlfs for design of vlfs model experiment and 3d hydroelasticity numerical method are both common means to evaluate the structural response yago and endo 1996b chen 2003 lv et al 2004b wan 2014 ding et al 2015 li et al 2016 wu et al 2017a song 2012 a number of vlfss are studied by model tests and simulations in the world most of vlfss are of slender floating structures watanabe et al 2006 suzuki et al 2017 suzuki 2005 rognaas et al 2001 ochi and namseeg 1991 wang 2019 kim et al 1999 okubo 1996 yago and hara 1996 yago and endo 1996a 1996b lv et al 2004a 2004b wu et al 2016 2017a li et al 2016 2017 chen 2003 wan 2014 ding et al 2015 song 2012 however heteromorphic shape vlfs has not been designed and not been used in ocean so far heteromorphic shape vlfs is very different from slender vlfs so that heteromorphic shape vlfs has special load and response characteristic it is necessary to carry out experimental and numerical research on load and structural response for those heteromorphic shape vlfs if heteromorphic shape vlfs is designed the usage of ocean supporting platform requires a kind of heteromorphic shape vlfs for docking serval ships and well structural stability traditional slender vlfs is not fit for ocean supporting platform a hexagon type platform is proposed to be an alternative for ocean supporting platform wu et al 2017b the hep is of structural stability because it is made up of six single modules end by end a large moon pool provides a safe sheltering water area therefore a conception structure of hep which is made up of six trapezoidal floating structures connected by six rigid connectors and provides life accommodation ship docking and marine replenishment for many ocean going vessels at open sea is designed in original hep design fmrc hep and fmfc hep are both designed fmrc hep means that six modules are connected by six rigid connector so that no large rotation between modules fmfc hep implicates that six hinged connectors connect six modules so the rotations about common edges are allowed in fmfc hep fmfc hep induces complex multi body interaction therefore fmrc hep and fmfc hep has significant structural responses difference we both carry out researches on structural response of fmrc hep and fmfc hep the structural responses of fmrc hep and fmfc hep have to be discussed in two papers due to large amount of studying results this paper studies structural response of fmrc hep by means of experiment and numerical hydroelasticity another paper focuses on structural response of fmfc hep which is still compared to fmrc hep s only by using experiment method weiqin et al 2020 although these two papers both study hep connecting means and studying methods are different this paper studies the load and structural response of fmrc flexible module rigid connectors hexagon enclosed platform hep by means of model test and numerical investigation this paper proposes an experimental methodology to measure the load and structural response and applies numerical hydroelasticity method to evaluate hydroelastic response for heteromorphic shape hep scaled model of fmrc hep is designed and fabricated then the model experiment is carried out in wave tank a number of experimental results are measured and obtained 3d hydroelastic code homer is used to evaluate elastic response of hep model tested the model experiment numerical results and experimental results are compared and verified to analyse the structural response mechanism of fmrc hexagon enclosed platform in this paper structural response mechanism of a fmrc hexagon enclosed platform is studied and obtained by model experiment and numerical investigation to guide structural design of hexagon enclosed platform and to provide design and evaluation reference for other enclosed ocean platforms 2 structural design of hep model a hep hexagon enclosed platform provides life accommodation ship docking and marine replenishment for many ocean going vessels in far ocean the hexagon enclosed platform is made up of six trapezoidal floating structures connected by six rigid connectors as fig 1 shown all single structural modules will be built and dragged to match at service sea as fig 1 shown the outsides and insides are used to dock for ocean going vessels there is a large moon pool in the centre of hep so the enclosed kind of platform can withstand out waves to be an artificial sheltered harbour outside edges of hep can be used to short term docking for ships inside edges of hep can be used when long term docking or heave sea hep can dock 3 or 4 ocean going vessels at most this platform can provide life accommodation ship docking ship maintenance and marine replenishment large life space can provide life recreation and medical treatment for people as fig 1 shown hep has six single modules which are connected end by end there are one life modulus for people life four operation modules for ship docking ship maintenance and marine replenishment and one gate modulus which equips thrusters to drift when ships are passing in and out hep has the characteristics of mat type structure which horizontal dimensions are large and moulded depth is small so hydroelastic response of hep is significant in this paper experiment model is designed from conceptual structure of hep the model experiment of hep is used to study the structural responses mechanism of hep structure in waves it is a feasible means to study the characteristics of structural response of hep structure by means of model experiment due to low cost and suitable size model experiment of fmrc hep is used to measure strain histories to analyse structural mechanism of hep structure therefore the experiment model of hep is elastic but rigid the stiffness of design model of hep is determined based on a similarity theory which is used by chen et al 2003 for model design of a vlfs the experimental model and real hep must satisfy geometrical similarity and hydrodynamic similarity and structural similarity are both satisfied if they are of hydroelastic similarity geometrical similarity means that structural scale size deformation wave length and wave height should satisfy eq 1 1 l r l m λ where l is scale dimension λ is scaled ratio r means conceptual structure m denotes experiment model hydrodynamic similarity considers the effect of free surface and gravity so that froude number should be equal between experiment model and conceptual structure wave is an unsteady flows and has periodic motion so that strouhal number should be equal for ocean wave and tank wave the hydrodynamic similarity should satisfy eq 2 lin et al 1991 2 v r g r l r v m g m l m l r v r t r l m v m t m where v is velocity t is wave period and g is acceleration of gravity structural similarity requires the ratio of real structure deflection to scaled model deflection being equal to the scaled ratio λ as eq 3 3 w r w m λ q r l r 3 e r i r λ q m l m 3 e m i m where w is deflection of structure q is distribution load the loads of real structure and scaled model is three power of scaled ratio so stiffness of real structure and scaled model is obtained as eq 4 yu et al 1991 4 e r i r e m i m λ 5 according to above hydroelastic similarities involving geometrical similarity hydrodynamic similarity and structural similarity the design model of hep is designed the scale ratio between conceptual structure and experiment model of hep is determined to 100 in the case of considering wall boundary effect and wave tank dimensions so the dimensions of experiment model is presented in table 2 six trapezoidal modules is fabricated respectively and then they are matched by using rigid connector to form hexagonal shape as fig 2 a shows hydrodynamic similarity is used to determine wave case structural similarity is used to guide the structural design of experiment model the experiment model should be elastic to be measured for strain information therefore two layer structure is used for experiment model of hep as fig 2 b shows upper layer is steel plate which provides stiffness and strength and it can be measured by strain gage under layer is waterproof foam material with low hardness which can provide buoyancy and initial stiffness steel plate and foam layer are clung by super glue to constitute a single modulus the thickness of steel plate is determined 0 5 mm to make sure the stiffness of a single module should satisfy eq 4 as table 2 0 gives according to design of conceptual structure of hep where six rigid connectors are used so rigid connection is simulated in experiment model rigid connector of experiment model is designed as fig 2 c presents box irons are inserted bush on each short edge of single module box iron and single module are both drilled same holes where bolts are fasten so that the rigid connection is obtained in experiment model additional cylinder irons are distributed uniformly on model plate on the basis of weight of conceptual structure to obtain design draft as fig 2 a shows 3 experimental and numerical methodologies of 3d hydroelastic response of hep model considering possible 3d hydroelastic response of real hep structure in ocean waves a tank experiment is carried out to test hydroelastic response of hep model and 3d hydroelastic theory is used to calculate the hydroelastic responses by using a 3d hydroelastic system homer which combines hydrodynamics code bem and structural dynamics code fem experimental and numerical methodologies are both used to analyse the hydroelastic mechanism of hep model 3 1 experimental methodology of hep model the experiment of hep model is carried out in the wave tank of wut wuhan university of technology as shown in fig 3 main dimensions of the wave tank is 132m 10 8m 2m the depth is able to be adjusted regular waves irregular wave and freak waves can be made by a flap type wave maker high precision wave gauge is used to measure wave elevation and non contact motion capturing system is used to test model motion structural responses of hep is studying objective in this paper dynamic strain signals are collected to analyse the structural responses of hep modulus number of six modules is determined the 3 adjacent modules are arranged 4 strain gages in each while another 3 modules are arranged 1 strain gage in each to verify symmetry of the model 15 strain gages are arranged on steel plate of experiment model as fig 4 shows two wave gages is placed before hep to test wave elevation all gages are connected to a acquisition instrument which has 32 channels and sample frequency is 500 hz all experimental devices are presented in table 3 the hydroelastic model test of hep is carried out in a large towing and wave tank in which length is 132m width is 10 8m and water depth is 4m in wuhan university of technology maximum wave height reaches 0 4m wave gauge is used to record dynamic wave elevation in the experiment this experiment is carried out in a towing tank equipped a wave maker so the wave tank is long and wide enough and a wave maker is located at its one of end one wave direction from wave maker to another end of tank is obtained in the tank wave tank is divided into wave making area testing area and wave absorbing area and hep model is placed in testing area as fig 5 shows wave making area is used to make waves testing area is located at 20m from wave maker hep model is floating blow tow truck where strain lines are passed through and sensor information are gathered wave absorbing area is end of wave tank which absorbs waves to avoid large reflected waves in order to obtain two wave angles 0 and 30 as fig 4 shows the hep model arrangement is changed as fig 6 illustrates several light and slender mooring lines are fasten between model angles and towing rails tank width is much larger than width of hep model so that tank wall effect is avoided two wave angles 0 and 30 are tested due to symmetry of the model the common edge of no 1 and no 6 modulus is normal to wave maker in the case of 0 as fig 6 a while the long edge of no 6 modulus is face to wave maker in the case of 30 as fig 6 b shows 48 wave cases are made to measure hydroelastic response of hep model in the experiment 24 cases are used to perform the tank experiments for 0 incoming wave and another 24 cases are used to carry out the tank experiment for 30 incoming wave in each wave angle arrangement 21 wave case are used to change wave length from 0 6m to 6m 4 wave cases are used to change wave height from 0 035m to 0 06m in the experiment mooring lines is in a relax statement mooring lines are used to restrain model horizontal drift motion and 1st order motions of model are not restricted 3 2 numerical methodology of 3d hydroelastic simulation the general methodology for hydroelastic ship beam model is rather well known and the first developments can be attributed to bishop price bishop and price 1979 3d hydroelastic theory is proposed by wu by combining 3d bem and 3d fem wu 1984 then 3d hydroelastic theory is widely applied for ship engineering especially 3d hydroelasticity is most important evaluating theory to study structural responses of vlfs in waves because vlfs has large horizontal dimensions and low overall stiffness in contrast to the well known rigid body seakeeping model the 3d hydroelastic theory basically extends the motion representation with the additional modals of motion deformation chosen as a series of the wet structural natural modals structural responses of large floating structure is linear if it has small motion and elastic deformation in waves so the displacement h x y z of floating structure involving motion and deformation is expressed by mode superposition method 5 h x y z i 1 n ξ i t h i x y z i 1 n ξ i t h x i x y z i h y i x y z j h z i x y z k where h i x y z denotes the general motion deformation modal which can be either rigid or elastic the above decomposition leads to the additional radiation boundary value problems bvp for elastic modes with the following change in the body boundary condition n is total modal number including rigid modal number and flexible modal number and rigid modal number is 6 which represents 6 degree of freedom of rigid motion and n 6 is flexible modal number the displacement h x y z of floating structure is solved by a quadratic partial differential equation 6 a a h b b h c c h f where a b c are generalized structural mass matrix damping matrix and stiffness matrix a b c are generalized added mass matrix wave damping matrix and restoring force matrix f are generalized wave forces when eq 5 is substituted to eq 6 to transform the solving the variable h to ξ structural response of large floating structure can be solved on the basis of modal superposition in waves dynamic structural code nastran is used to solve stress as 7 σ x x y z r 1 m ξ r σ x r where m is the flexible modal number m n 6 coupled dynamic equation eq 6 in frequency domain can be written as follows 8 ω e 2 m a i ω e b k c ξ f d i where m is modal genuine mass k is modal structural stiffness a is hydrodynamic added mass b is hydrodynamic damping c is hydrostatic stiffness ξ is modal amplitudes f d i is wave excitation force which is solved by the sum of integral force of incident wave velocity potential and diffraction potential on ship wet surface as eq 9 9 f d i f f k f d i ω ρ s b φ i φ d n i d s elements of added mass a and hydrodynamic damping b are obtained by integral of radiation potential as eq 10 and eq 11 10 a i j ρ re s b ϕ r j h i n d s 11 b i j ρ ω e im s b ϕ r j h i n d s diffraction potential and radiation potential can be solved by bem or method of sources as eq 12 12 ϕ s b σ x h g x h x s d s where σ x h is source function hydrodynamic code hydrostar is introduced to solve above hydrodynamic coefficients and potentials in order to simulate the dynamic response it is necessary to move to the time domain this will be performed using a procedure proposed by cummins lin et al 1991 rewrite the time domain equivalent of the motion equation as eq 13 13 m a ξ t k c ξ t 0 t k t τ ξ τ d τ f d i t q t where a is infinite frequency added mass matrix k t is matrix of impulse response functions impulse response functions can be calculated from the frequency dependent damping coefficients as eq 14 14 k i j t 2 π 0 b i j ω cos ω t d w a 3d hydroelastic analysis platform homer combining a structural solver nastran and hydrodynamic solver hydrostar is used to analyse 3d elastic response of hep experiment model the hydroelastic code homer is developed by bureau veritas up to now homer is used to solve 3d hydroelastic response of large ship and ocean structures in some studies malenica et al 2003 2008 tuitman and malenica 2009 the sachem of homer is given in fig 7 structural solver and hydrodynamic solver calculate independently but homer uses their computational results to couple hydroelastic responses fem model of hep considering balance weight distribution and structural weight as fig 8 hydrodynamic model is given as fig 9 shows origin of coordinates is determined at center point on structural bottom surface in two models in fem model mass point elements are arranged on corresponding locations on plate of hep to simulate the additional cylinder irons rigid many point contraction mpc is used to connect all modules 160428 elements are meshed in the fem model 2032 bem panels are meshed on wet surface of hep for calculating wave load and structure motion in hydrodynamic model homer uses the two models to calculate the 3d structural responses of hep considering hydroelastic effect in this numerical study it is spent about 0 5 h for a frequency domain case and it takes about 6 h for a time domain case 3 3 analysis of modal and frequency domain stress rao according to the experimental programme 50 wave cases are performed in tank waves stress from strain gauge are obtained at each stress points therefore a number of time domain strain histories are recorded and transformed to analyse frequency domain stress rao response amplitude operator in this study a number of frequency domain stress raos including experimental results and numerical results are obtained experimental results are obtained in the hydroelastic model experiment of hep and numerical results are calculated by means of 3d hydroelastic solver homer a number of stress points are selected to analyse frequency domain structural response based on all experimental and numerical results with changing wave frequency wave height and wave angle 4 1 modal analysis of hep model 3d hydroelastic response is obtained on the basis of modal superposition method so that the first 9 modals are analysed as fig 10 shows in modal analysis the arranging angle of hep model is the 0 position as shown in fig 4 it is indicated from fig 10 that hep model has significant local modal local modal appears each single modulus it is analysed that hep has wide horizontal area and short depth its overall stiffness is relative small and the stiffness in all directions of horizontal plane is close so that the modal characteristic of hep is very different from ship type structure the first 9 dry wet frequencies for flexible modal is given in table 4 0 it is seem that wet frequencies are closer it means that their springing responses are possible to be induced in these wave cases which wave frequencies are close to the wet frequencies therefore the first 9 flexible modals are used to superpose to calculate hydroelastic responses of hep in numerical investigation 4 2 analysis of linearity and symmetry of stress points experiment and numerical results need to be verify their availability by means of studying linearity of data and symmetry of stress points 4 wave cases changing wave height are carried out to check experimental linearity as figs 11 and 8 of all wave cases are used to study the linearity experimental results wave parameters of the 8 wave cases are presented in tables 5 0 and 4 wave cases are used for wave angle 0 while another 4 wave cases are studied for wave angle 30 each 4 wave cases changes the wave height from 0 035m to 0 06m while wave lengths and periods are same fig 11 a presents stress linearity of stress points by changing wave height at wave angle 0 and fig 11 b gives stress of points by changing wave height at wave angle 30 they are manifested that the experimental results have evident linearity so that research data are of confidence level experiment and numerical results of symmetrical stress points on hep model are discussed to determine the availability of data fig 12 a shows stress raos of no 1 and 15 point at wave angle 0 it implies that no 1 and no 15 point which are symmetrical at wave angle 0 have very close values so that the data availability is acceptable fig 12 b shows stress raos of no 1 and 14 point at wave angle 30 it shows that no 1 and no 14 point have very close values so fig 12 also verifies the symmetry of stress points fig 12 verifies the symmetry of stress points so that stress values are believable including experiment and numerical calculation 4 3 analysis of effect of wave angle on structural responses effects of two wave angles such as 0 and 30 shown in fig 4 on stress response are studied in this paper as fig 4 shows no 1 no 5 and no 9 point are located at centre points on deck plane of no 1 no 2 and no 3 modulus the experimental and numerical results of no 1 no 5 and no 9 point are analysed and compared stress raos of no 1 no 5 and no 9 point are shown at wave angle 0 and 30 fig 13 presents stress raos of no 1 5 and 9 point at wave angle 0 and 30 fig 13 a shows stress raos of no 1 point by changing wave angle 0 and 30 it is found that no 1 point or no 1 modulus has larger stress level at wave angle 30 because it is analysed that no 1 point is closer to mid hep at wave angle 30 fig 13 b presents stress raos of no 5 point by changing wave angle 0 and 30 stress of no 5 represents the strength level of no 2 modulus it is shown that no 2 modulus has a little higher stress at stage of low frequency at wave angle 0 where no 5 point is located at mid hep section while no 5 point doesn t locate at mid hep any more at wave angle 30 fig 13 c shows stress raos of no 9 point it denotes that no 3 modulus has higher stress at stage of low frequency at wave angle 0 because no 9 point is close to mid hep section at wave angle 0 while long edge of no 3 modulus is perpendicular to wave direction at wave angle 30 hexagon shape of hep doesn t have simple effect to determine which wave angle is serious 4 4 analysis of stress distribution between modules stress raos of stress points is analysed to study structural stress distribution of hep as fig 5 shows no 1 is heading to wave firstly no 2 modulus is middle modulus of hep and no 3 modulus is end of hep model while hep model is ahead at wave angle 0 the strength of no 1 no 2 and no 3 modulus is studied by discussing on no 1 no 5 and no 9 stress point because they respectively locate at centre point of no 1 and no 2 and no 3 modulus fig 14 a demonstrates stress raos of no 1 5 and 9 point at wave angle 0 it indicates that no 2 has higher stress because it is located at middle part at the angle 0 when hep model is ahead to wave angle 30 long edge of no 6 modulus with a centre stress point no 15 is perpendicular to wave direction and no 1 modulus and no 2 modulus are symmetrical around middle section of hep therefore stress of no 1 5 and 15 point is discussed at wave angle 30 fig 14 b shows stress raos of no 1 5 and 9 point at wave angle 30 it manifests that no 1 modulus and no 2 modulus has close results while no 6 has low amplitude stress because no 1 modulus and no 2 modulus is symmetrical about a a axis shown in fig 4 and no 6 modulus is located the end side of hep at the wave angle 30 5 analysis of time domain stress histories a number of wave cases are carried out to obtain the frequency domain stress results 4 typical time domain wave cases are selected to analyse time domain structural features of hep model the parameters of wave cases are presented in table 6 0 case 1 2 are posited in wave angle 0 and case 3 4 are faced to wave angle 30 with changing wave periods two wave periods which reflect typical structural features at intermediate and high frequency are discussed in the paper in this experiment it is seem that elastic hep model has resonant vibration responses so it is necessary to determine the hydroelastic characteristic of hep model by analysing time domain stress histories and then transfer them to spectrum curves fig 15 shows the time domain stress histories of stress point no 5 involving numerical calculation and experiment at wave angle 0 a denotes case 1 b shows case 2 c gives case 3 and d presents case 4 it is obvious from fig 15 that time domain numerical results and experimental results have good agreement it is indicated that the 3d hydroelastic numerical simulation method is applicable for evaluating hydroelastic responses of hep model in this experiment case 2 was carried out three times to study repeatability of experiment so the availability of the experiment is determined the time domain histories of no 5 point of case 2 are shown in fig 16 for three repeatable tests it is seen from fig 16 that the time domain histories of three case 2 tests are very close implying that the hep hydroelastic experiment has good repeatability and the experimental results are reliable it is also seen from fig 15 that time domain stress histories of case 1 and case 3 have smooth curves while case 2 and case 4 have significant resonant vibration responses so it is necessary to determine the hydroelastic characteristic of hep model experimental and numerical time domain stress curves are transformed to frequency spectrum curves by means of fourier transformation to analyse the hydroelastic characteristic of hep model fig 17 presents the frequency spectrum curves of case 1 2 3 and 4 it is obvious that these curves have multi peaks and experimental and numerical frequency spectrum curves have similar peak distribution fig 17 a shows that the amplitude of subsequent peaks are very smaller than 1st peak so that the time domain history is smooth it means case 1 has feeble hydroelastic response and wave load plays a major role on structural response of hep model however it is seen that 1st peak frequencies are very equal to wave encountering frequencies the subsequent peak frequencies are very close to double triple and quadruple encountering wave frequencies in fig 15 and 2nd peak frequencies are very close to the 7th wet modal in fig 17 a and c 3rd peak frequencies are very close to the 11th wet modal in fig 17 b and d the subsequent peaks have significant amplitude in fig 17 b d so it indicates that the nonlinear springing response of hep model is generated it is seen from fig 17 that there is certain difference between experiment and time domain numerical calculation it is indicated that nonlinearities are appeared in experiment while 3d hydroelasticity method can t consider nonlinearity it is analysed that the hep model has a large moon pool where internal free surface is nonlinear in experiment in addition hydroelasticity method is based on potential flow theory which can t consider viscidity effect viscidity damping coefficient used in simulation can t simulate complicated viscidity effect happened in experiment the deformation mode of hep model is paid a close attention two moments t1 and t2 of case 1 which reflect hogging and sagging shown in fig 15 a are selected to analyse structural deformation of hep model fig 18 displays structural deformation of hep model of case 1 at t1 and fig 19 shows structural deformation of hep model of case 1 at t2 they are found that simulation and experiment have accordant deformation modes 6 summary 6 1 discussion in this study one can see that the experimental results and the numerical results have good agreements but there are still some discrepancies worth discussing for example it is noticed that numerical results suggest peaks exist at high frequency while the experimental results don t figs 12 14 this is because those high frequency responses are very difficult to perform in the water tank due to the fact that they are close to the wetted frequency table 4 0 another point is that experimental test results demonstrates somewhat higher response range compared with the numerical results figs 15 16 this is because the numerical results are obtained based on linear methods in the laboratory test significant nonlinear effects exist furthermore there is a large moon pool in the center of the hep structure where nonlinearity of the free surface inside is even higher additionally viscous effects such as vortex shedding will affect the accuracy a little bit although it is not very significant in regular wave in short based on our analysis and international towing tank conference ittc procedures ittc committee 2017 there is room to improve the numerical method but the results are quite acceptable compared against the water tank test 6 2 highlight this paper studies the hydroelastic responses of a fmrc hep model by the means of experiment and numerical simulation the fmrc hep model is spliced by 6 trapezoidal modules the hep model is designed to be flexible and the connector is rigid so that its stress and deformation response can be obtained a 3d hydroelastic code homer is used to calculate the numerical response of hep model then a hydroelastic experiment is designed to study the real mechanism of hep model and to verify the effectiveness of simulation based on simulation results and experimental results including frequency domain and time domain it is found that experimental results and numerical results have accordant and close matching it is indicated that the numerical approach is believable and can be popularized to evaluate the structural response of mat type ocean platform and the experimental method is also verified by numerical simulation it is found that the hydroelastic responses of hep model is generated indeed frequency domain raos of stress have multiple significant and close peaks and the time domain stress curves is transformed by fourier transformation to analyse frequency spectrum indicating springing responses is induced so the hydroelastic response should be considered when the platform is designed although hydroelastic response is produced its amplitude is smaller than the responses induced by low frequency wave load on the basis of the characteristics of shape and structure the intermediate modulus of hep along wave direction need to be paid a close attention 0 incident wave has significant response the hexagon enclosed platform model using rigid connectors is studied in this paper the fmrc hep model is studied for its structural safety in waves in this paper designers and authors are expecting that the hep will be put into operation and applied to develop ocean service hep consists of multi modulus so that it has the advantage of fast moving and splicing it is applied in deep ocean it is found from research results that this hexagon enclosed platform is satisfied for the strength evaluation it is verified to play a rule to be several alternatives for ocean platform firstly hep is expected to be multipurpose ocean platform which provides life accommodation ship docking and marine replenishment for many ocean going vessels in deep ocean secondly hep is also expected to be ocean sightseeing platform for docking large luxury liners and cruise ships there are a lot of five star rooms multifunction meeting rooms restaurants entertainment places fishing and scuba diving facilities hep doesn t only becomes sighting and entertainment places combining catering entertainment accommodation business and replenishment but is docking ports for tourist ships thirdly hep is also alternative for a scientific and experiment platform which is used for marine science research ocean environment measure experiment verification and ocean monitoring finally hep is a choose for ship repairing platform too there is a large moon pool that provides well safe sheltering water area for repaired ships and such platform may provide abundant repairing facilities and materials all in all hep provides various options for deep ocean platform which has multipurpose application for devolving ocean service credit authorship contribution statement weiqin liu writing original draft study design xiaoxuan guo writing original

20644,water ballast type floating breakwater has a wide range of applications due to its good wave attenuation performance in this study a series of physical model tests have been carried out to get insights into the dynamic response characteristics quantitatively of the floating breakwater and tension of the mooring lines the external and inner water pressure and its distribution on the floating body are presented the results show that the sway and roll motions of the floating body exhibit strongly nonlinear characteristics as a result of water on deck and sloshing occurrence the heave motion maintains a downward drifting and the greatest heave amplitude occurs when the wave period is close to the heave natural period at both waveward and leeward side of the floating body the mooring lines give almost comparable amplitudes but opposite phase of tension in terms of both upper and lower the maximum water pressures appear at the waveward side which is near the still water level at the corner between the floating box and the vertical plate the pressure changes sharply leading to a snap value overall the results in this study provide a database for detailed design for the water ballast type floating breakwaters in future structural and material selection keywords floating breakwater water ballast type dynamic response experimental study 1 introduction floating breakwaters have been increasingly used as an alternative structure in ports or coastal protection which display advantage in terms of construction economics and ecology they are especially competitive in regions with poor foundations deep water ice problems and large tidal range and high water quality requirement when compared to the traditional ponderous bottom mounded breakwaters as a key planned port project in fuzhou port east china songxia port area has deep water and convenient channel for ships entering and leaving the port the songxia port area is to be built in three stages by using an encircled breakwater to enclose a semi enclosed sea area to provide a relatively stable condition for ship docking see fig 1 at present the first and second phase of the breakwater has been completed and under construction respectively using gravity type structure which prevents waves invasion from the north and east respectively as a result the construction of gravity type breakwater hinders the water exchange of the port area leading to deterioration of water quality the tidal range of songxia port area is quite large reaching up to 8 10 m if the traditional gravity type is still adopted in the third phase of the breakwater project higher construction costs must be paid to prevent wave overtopping during high tide most importantly the proposed third phase breakwater of the songxia port area which prevents wave invasion from the south is close to a marine ecological protection zone the traditional gravity structure will further hinder the water exchange of the port area in the meantime large scale construction will seriously damage the local marine ecological environment to address this issue the floating breakwater scheme has been put on the agenda which is expected to not only reduce the damage to the marine environment but also greatly reduce the construction cost in the past few decades much research effort has gone into aspects related to the conceptual design of the floating breakwater lots of floating breakwaters with novel configurations have been proposed under various circumstances for a better performance and or high cost effectiveness for example the cage type pontoon murali and mani 1997 breakwaters with two rectangular floaters connected by horizontal cylinders nakamura et al 1999 the tethered spar buoy fence liang et al 2004 the submerged box type floating breakwater rahman et al 2006 the horizontal interlaced multilayer mats hegde et al 2007 the floating board with nets dong et al 2008 the porous assembled blocks wang and sun 2010 the box type floating breakwater with truss uzaki et al 2011 breakwaters with multiple layers of pipes patil et al 2011 the frame type breakwaters composed of two identical cylindrical columns merlevede 2012 the asymmetrical energy capturing pontoon madhi et al 2014 floating breakwater with flexible connectors loukogeorgaki et al 2014 the double cylinders with mesh cage and balls inside ji et al 2015 the floating breakwaters with double layered perforated walls xiao et al 2016 the oscillating buoy wec type floating breakwater ning et al 2016 and the asymmetrical f type pontoon duan et al 2017 the integrated breakwater wec system zhao et al 2019 furthermore some novel shapes have been proposed e g π shaped floating breakwaters gesraha 2006 r shaped floating breakwaters wang and sun 2010 t shaped floating breakwaters zhan et al 2017 and inversed t shaped floating breakwaters neelamani and rajendran 2002 chen et al 2016 deng et al 2019 etc for the existing floating breakwater structure multifarious wave attenuation mechanisms have been utilized including the wave reflection wave energy dissipating and limit the generation of radiation waves etc most of them are suitable for short wave condition and waters where the tidal range is small however there is still a problem that limits the application in relative longer wave and larger tide range environment furthermore the effectiveness exertion of wave attenuation is limited by the materials used as the conventional material steel or reinforced concrete must contend with the fact that the former is highly corrosive in the seawater and the latter is fragile in wave dynamic loading inspired by the anti rolling tank which has been widely used in the field of naval architecture moaleji and greig 2007 a water ballast type floating breakwater has been firstly proposed by yang et al 2018 the main feature of this new structure is the use of a ballasted water tank and a vertical plate which allow for stronger water vortex liquid sloshing wave overtopping and wave breaking developing surrounding or within the structure for the restriction of the floating body the mooring chain is designed to be dual tensional in order to obtain more restrictions on the movements of floating breakwater for the material a kind of reinforced composite material which has high performance in corrosion resistance crashworthiness and fatigue resistance is used which allows the floating box conventionally ballasted with fixed rocks or sands to be ballasted with the low cost seawater these improvements effectively improve the performance in reducing the wave transmission currently the water ballast type floating breakwater has been selected as one of the important alternatives for the songxia port the hydrodynamic effectiveness has also been systemically investigated through a series of experiments yang et al 2018 using a coupled sph mooring model liu and wang 2020a b numerically investigated the wave attenuation performances and hydrodynamics of the water ballast submerged moored box type floating breakwaters with different shapes of cross sections these results support that the new floating breakwater has competitive effectiveness when compared to the traditional floating breakwaters however there are limited investigations on the dynamic response of the moored floating body under different wave conditions which is actually critical for the security of the application for practical application of a floating breakwater how to ensure its safety in their life cycle is most important issue including safety of the mooring line and the floating box structure for example whether the floating body will ground during use and significantly impact the erosion and deposition of the seabed over the long term when the mooring lines and floating box exceed their strength and fatigue limits in practice however it must be aware that many nonlinear phenomena occur along with green water loadings on the small freeboard floating structures in rough waves such as slamming violent impact force wave breaking water air mixing and associated turbulence zhao et al 2014 furthermore the presence of ballast water significantly increases the complexity of dynamic response for the floating box structure although a lot of numerical model studies have been proposed to address the wave induced nonlinear motions for the2d floating body sueyoshi et al 2008 hu and kashiwagi 2009 zhao et al 2014 in general it is still very challenging to set up a numerical simulation to predict its 6 dof motions mooring line tensions and structural stress accurately this is especially true for a multiple moored water ballast type floating body therefore in this study a series of experiments have been conducted to examine the dynamic responses of the water ballast type floating breakwater exposed to regular waves this study aims to provide a database for detailed designing for the water ballast type floating breakwaters in future structural and material selection experiments for 2d cases have been carried out in a wave flume the action of regular waves with wide ranges of wave heights and periods has been considered emphasis are given on the dynamic response characteristics quantitatively including the motion and water pressure of the floating body tension of the mooring lines to investigate the effect with aspect to different parameters i e structural parameters and wave conditions etc a free decay test has been carried out to study the natural dynamic characteristics of the moored floating system a tension amplitude ratio and its phase difference have also been defined to analyze the fairlead tensions between different mooing lines for both waveward leeward and upper lower side of the floating body in addition the external and inner water pressure and its distribution on the floating box and vertical plate have been presented to get insights into the dynamic mechanisms finally conclusions were drawn 2 experimental setup and conditions in the present study a series of hydrodynamic experiment were carried out to investigate the dynamic response of a water ballast type floating breakwater parameters of the floating breakwater and wave conditions are based on an actual engineering in the following sub sections the experimental set up and experimental conditions of the present investigation are described part of this description has been also presented in yang et al 2018 2 1 model of floating body and mooring line the floating body and mooring line model were constructed based on a typical prototype which is planned to utilize in songxia port of fujian province coastal areas in china the whole model was scaled following froude similitude with the geometrical scale of λ 1 25 a sketch of the floating breakwater model used is shown in fig 2 the dimension of the floating box is 0 4 m wide and 0 16 m high which has the ratio of wide to high of 2 5 for the convenience of fabrication and adjustment the model was made of resin matrix composite material built as two independent but symmetrical long parts and these two parts ultimately assembled together before putting into the wave flume each long part was separated into five water tanks by four bulkheads these water tanks can be injected with liquid like water to change the draft of floating breakwater after the completion of water injection the top of each long part was covered by a cover board a vertical plate was mounted to the bottom of box structure with the height of 0 12 m for improving the structural integrity and strength several rib plates were fixed between the bottom of box structure and the vertical plate the bulkheads and rib plates were made of 5 mm thickness and the other components of the model were made of 10 mm thickness while for achieving the target total dry mass of 21 82 kg this kind of floating breakwater is referred to as water ballast type which use several wave attenuation mechanisms for instance wave reflection water sloshing wave breaking and wave current interactions more details about the model structure or design principles can also be found in yang et al 2018 it is well known that the tension status of the mooring line directly affects the movement of the moored floating breakwater which further significantly affects the performance of the breakwater in wave attenuation in order to improve the performance the floating body was designed as taut moored four sets of mooring lines were installed on each side of the floating breakwater and a total of eight sets four in the waveward side and four in the leeward side of the floating breakwater were applied each set consists of two mooring lines one connecting to the bottom edge of box structure and the other one connecting to the vertical plate the other ends of both mooring lines were together fastened to an anchor which fixed on the flume bottom the horizontal distance of anchor to origin is 3 28 m this kind of tensional mooring configuration is expected to effectively restrict the sway and roll motions thus can reduce the motion radiated waves and is especially suitable for the floating breakwater hanging attachment underneath mani 1991 following the prototype the total length of each mooring line l 1 was selected equal to 3 57 m for the upper one and 3 87 m for the lower one l 2 namely the length of the mooring line was 4 5 times of the water depth for each mooring line the whole line was hanging in the water i e no length lying at the bottom the model mooring line was made of stainless steel with a submerged weight per unit length of 94 72 g m such that the mass per unit length satisfies the gravity similarity since its total length is limited the deformation of mooring line is tiny and the elastic deformation is negligible therefore it is impractical to simulate the elastic deformation of the prototype chain by using the model chain directly for this reason a wire spring was mounted on the bottom of the model chain for compensating the elastic deformation in consistency with the prototype according to wilson equation the tension deformation curve of the simulating lines is calculated as 1 t m c p d p 2 δ s s n λ 3 in which t m means the model tension while δs s is the elongation c p is the elasticity modulus d p is the diameter of prototype mooring line n constant as 1 5 on the basis of the prototype wire and λ is the model scale the mooring lines were calibrated by selecting different linear springs in order to match the target elastic characteristics example of relationship between the measured spring elongation and the spring tension elastic deformation of the spring is shown in fig 3 it can be seen that the theoretical and simulated tension deformation agree well the deformation curve of the spring is basically linear when the tension is less than 150 n which indicates that the reasonable of using spring to simulate mooring line stiffness the model rigidity coefficient is approximate to k 99 0 kg m which correspond to 2 elongation of the prototype mooring line moreover it should be noted that the model chain s material should be selected to maintain the flexibility of the chain in the prototype the schematic diagram for layout of the physical model can be found in fig 4 the related parameters of the floating breakwater model which is adopted in the physical experiment are exhibited in table 1 to acquire an accurate dynamic response of the floating breakwater the deviation detection for model parameters was carried out during the manufacture period and the error range was controlled within 2 2 2 experimental facility and setup the experiments were carried out in the 2d wave flume of the national engineering laboratory for port hydraulic construction technology tianjin research institute for water transport engineering m o t in china scales of the wave flume are 90 m long 1 0 m wide and 2 0 m deep at one side of the wave flume a piston type wavemaker was installed which is capable of generating uni directional waves at the other side an artificial gravel sloping beach 1 10 was mounted to absorb the reflected waves indeed this kind of small slope with high porosity beach prevents wave reflections effectively besides reflected waves by the floating breakwater were propagating toward to the wavemaker therefore rather than the reflection from the dissipation beach the reflection from the wavemaker was the main concern during the experiments to eliminate the wave re reflection generated by the wavemaker an active wave absorption control method was used in the wavemaker system more details can also be found in yang et al 2018 which allows for generation of incident waves and absorption of reflected waves synchronously fig 5 shows a sketch of layout about the wave flume experimental setup and the definition of coordinate system the floating model was 55 m away from the wavemaker and kept as an equilibrium position by a series of tensional mooring lines from the top view of the layout fig 5 b it can be seen that four ball bearings were mounted on the two sides of the floating box which has the aim to sustain the breakwater along to the flume walls and to avoid the collision between floating model and walls in the experiment the ball bearings on the top part of the breakwater have all directions to rotate therefore the friction between the floating body and flume walls was minimized and could be ignored at the same time its only 15 mm thick of exposed portion for each ball bearing after installation corresponding to the wave flume so that very few incoming waves would across directly the gap between the floating body and flume walls in this manner the 3d motion responses of the floating breakwater tend towards 2d responses he et al 2017 the measurement instrument consists of a twenty eight water pressure sensor wp for measuring the water pressure and consequently the water pressure at the inner wall and at the outer wall of the floating box are obtained b eight one dimensional s beam tension and compression type load cells lc for measuring the mooring lines tension and c nine wave gauges for recording the wave elevation at selected points in the waveward and leeward side of the floating body d a fastrak motion tracking system mts for measuring the motion responses of the floating body a sketch for showing the position of the wp is given in fig 6 there are two kinds of measure points distributed on the floating body i e the outside measure points op and inside points ip in the present experiment the wp is a piezoresistive type with the pressure capacity equaling 100 pa all the water pressure data were recorded with a sampling frequency of 100 hz the actual installation photo of the water pressure sensor and the mts is shown in fig 7 as to the lc eight lcs capacity 100 n were installed at each top of the mooring line four lcs were installed at the waveward part of the floating body while the rest four lcs were installed at the leeward side all the lcs were put in the middle of the model as shown in fig 5 lower part detail installation method of the mooring line the lc and the spring are sketched in fig 8 four mooring lines ml1 ml2 ml3 and ml4 which correspond to the waveward upper waveward lower leeward upper and leeward lower side of the floating body respectively were representatively selected for analyzing the mooring line tension subsequently all the mooring line tension data were recorded with a sampling frequency of 100 hz nine wave gauges resistance type were used to record the wave time series in which one was mounted on the wave paddle for data feedback of the active wave absorption controlling and others were placed at both waveward side and leeward side of the floating breakwater for calibration of the incoming wave and measuring the wave field at specify point the time series of wave elevation were recorded with a sampling frequency of 50 hz for measuring the motion response of the floating model in the wave flume experiment a fastrak motion tracking system mts was used to measure the 6 dofs it should be mentioned that in the present research the motion responses of floating model were reduced to a two dimensional problem and only the heave sway and roll motion were useful all the motion results were recorded with a sampling frequency of 100 hz a monitor a data logger and a computer were adopted to record the time series of wave surface while another data logger and computer were used to record data related with the wp the lc and the mts synchronously the used floating body and relevant measurement instruments including the water pressure sensor wp the s type load cells lc the wave gauge wg and the motion tracking system mts are pictured in fig 9 2 3 experimental conditions in this study only the regular waves were considered throughout the experiment the water depth h remains unchanged as 0 6 m the wave period ranged from 1 2 s to 2 8 s while the wave height changes from 0 04 m to 0 26 m to control the wave steepness h l where l is the wave length the combination of incoming wave period and height was chosen for each wave condition detailed arrangement of wave parameter could be found in table 2 each wave period was combined with three wave steepness values h l 0 02 0 03 0 04 to explore the combined effect of the wave parameter and the angle of different mooring lines in the present experiment the mooring angle θ 1 θ 2 were taken as 30 27 and 60 55 respectively see fig 4 so that a total of forty eight cases were considered before conducting the case study the incident wave parameters were carefully calibrated and the deviations were controlled within 5 prior to the installation of floating body the incident wave was calibrated by wave gauges placed where the floating model would be installed after installing the floating body and before conducting the formal model tests all the load cells were carefully adjusted to balance the initial tension of the mooring line for the waveward and leeward the initial mooring line tension is presented in table 3 moreover to avoid the influence of zero drift of the recording system all the sensors including water pressure mooring line tension wave gauge and motion tracking were set to 0 at still water condition for every tested case therefore during the formal tests all the recorded values actually include the wave induced dynamic variables solely and exclude the initial offset 3 results 3 1 free decay test to investigate the dynamic characteristics of the floating breakwater system the natural period and damping ratio of the floating body were identified firstly a decay test for the moored floating body was considered two mooring angles θ 1 θ 2 30 27 and 60 55 were considered in the decay tests the floating breakwater was forced by a small initial displacement and then released as the effect of hydrostatic restoring force and elasticity of the mooring system the floating model gradually returns to the mean position as an example time histories of the heave and roll displacement in water for mooring angle 30 27 are depicted in fig 10 the natural periods of the floating body can be obtained by calculating the average period of all the oscillation processes using the zero crossing method correspondingly the natural periods of sway roll and heave for the floating body are shown in table 4 the natural period of heave is smaller than sway and roll as expected the natural period decease for the heave but increase for the sway and roll with increasing mooring angle this is mainly due to the restoring stiffness in vertical is larger than in horizontal and the discrepancy of restoring stiffness increases with the mooring angle the damping ratio of heave is also smaller than sway and roll however as the mooring angle increases the effect of the mooring angle to the damping ratio is weak 3 2 motion of the floating body as an example fig 11 demonstrates the time series of floating body motion with wave condition of t 2 2 s h 0 16 m with the mooring angle θ 1 θ 2 being 30 27 obviously the motion of floating body shows a remarkable regular change under incoming regular waves and the motion period is in accord with wave period it can be clearly seen that a new mean heave position drifting appears which are caused by the mean drift force the time series of sway and roll show a strongly nonlinearity as a result of water on deck and sloshing occurrence i e interaction between the floating box and the ballasted water inside e g hu and kashiwagi 2009 while the water on deck has an insignificant effect on the heave which can be attributed to the dynamic response mechanism of sway and roll are quite complicated when compared to heave for the water ballast type floating breakwater this phenomenon is probably different with the conventional box type floating breakwater or other floating structure song et al 2018 according to yang et al 2018 the wave attenuation mechanisms of the water ballast type breakwater including a wave reflection by the floating box and a middle vertical plate b water vortex generated by the bottom plate of floating box and the vertical plate c wave overtopping and wave breaking d sloshing occurs in the water ballast which weakens the motion induced radiated waves in addition the water ballast is a major component for the floating breakwater and it has a significant effect to the motion response of floating breakwater as to the heave motion the movement form is relatively simple since only the bottom spring of the mooring line provides the restoring force the inner ballasted water move up and down with the floating box and remains in a relatively dormant state however the inner water injected the box has the purpose of ballast and obtains an additional effect of making the box as an anti rolling structure which is more stable because of the ballasted water sloshes against the motion of sway and roll and it also makes the movement form of sway and roll highly nonlinear and more complicated evidences of the above phenomenon can be further found in fig 12 where the corresponding motion energy spectra analyses of fig 11 are given for the heave motion response the first order component which is governed by the incident wave frequency can be clearly observed the low frequency 0 hz component corresponds to the above mentioned mean heave position drifting however the sway and roll motion exhibit interesting remarkable high frequency 2nd order components respectively beside the first order component the secondary harmonics in the energy spectra up to one third of the first order value which should be considered in the engineering design there are two possible reasons for the secondary harmonics firstly for the motion of the water ballast type floating breakwater the motion phase of the inner water is opposite to that of the waves outside however the natural frequency of the inner water motion is 0 85 hz that is approximately 2 0 2 3 times that of the whole floating body see detailed discussion in yang et al 2018 which probably leads to the phenomenon of sub peak in the motion of the floating body secondly the motion of the floating body was restricted by four mooring lines on either side of it the tension of the four mooring lines have some phase difference therefore during the movement of the floating body the sudden tension of the mooring lines probably also makes the floating body appear higher order motion the dynamic displacement of the floating body was obtained under regular waves with the same wave steepness of 0 03 the variation of extremum motion response with wave period is shown in fig 13 the results show that the sway has growing tendency with increasing wave period fig 13 a to estimate the effect of mean drift force the average value of sway is also present in the figure it is interesting to find that the mean sway is quite small and is not affected significantly by the wave period this phenomenon is different compared with those of song et al 2018 in which the sway presents a considerable mean drift force traditionally for short waves relatively large motion of the floating body results in greater diffraction effects and greater mean 2nd order horizontal forces e g pinkster 1979 however in this paper a distinguishing feature is that the mooring lines are designed to be tensional rather than flabby in previous study and there is almost no free mooring line lying at the bottom therefore the wave induced mean drift forces can be effectively counteracted by the mooring line tensions the heave motion of floating body enlarges with the increase of the wave period before reaches the peak value of motion resonance at the natural period of the floating model fig 13 b it is higher than the wave amplitude and then tends to be equal to the wave amplitude as waves become longer in the downward direction the negative mean heave is mainly induced by the impact pressures of water wave overtopping on floating box wave period has a considerable effect to the mean heave motion and the peak value occurs at its natural period it means that the wave period plays a significant role for heave which directly affects the water wave overtopping amount on the floating body of particular note is that the greatest downward mean heave motion occurs under the wave condition of t t heave such fact has not been noticed so far in previous research to the author s knowledge the greatest mean heave in downward direction leads to the floating breakwater submerging in water and risk of the floating body grounding during use period which also impacts the erosion and deposition of the seabed in the long term the roll increases first and then maintain stable as wave period increases it approaches the local peaks about wave period of 1 8 s and 2 4 s as shown in fig 13 c this phenomenon is quite similar with those of journée 1991 which found that for longer waves of t t roll the roll amplitude is trending to the wave steepness and decreases with wavelength increasing since the mooring lines are designed to be tensional the wave induced mean drift force can be effectively counteracted by the mooring line force as expected the mean roll is closed to zero in addition from the free decay tests it has small discrepancies between resonant periods of roll and heave for the floating body and the natural periods which could be effected by coupling of wave actions and the hydrodynamic forces the sway heave and roll response amplitude operators rao of the floating body were obtained with the same wave steepness of 0 03 as plotted in fig 13 d results again confirm that the heave amplitude increases with increasing wave period and peaks at its natural period of 2 0 s the sway exhibits a dynamic magnification near short wave of 1 2 s beside the first order dynamic magnification near short wave of 2 8 s the rao of roll motion decreases as the wave period increases and basically stabilizes till wave period equals to 2 0 s 3 3 tensions of the mooring lines another key difference of the water ballast type floating breakwater in the present experiment with conventional ones is that we used four rows of mooring lines waveward upper ml1 waveward lower ml2 leeward upper ml3 and leeward lower ml4 to connect the floating body as murali and mani 1997 leading to the mechanical mechanism of the mooring line becoming increasingly complicated the mechanical property of mooring line is very important because it affects its strength design and fatigue analysis in murali and mani 1997 the effect of stiffness of mooring lines on wave transmission coefficient was analyzed carefully but unfortunately the tensions of mooring line were not measured in this section we will give a detailed discussion on the tensions of the mooring lines as an example fig 14 firstly shows the time series of tension with ml1 ml4 for selected different wave cases with the fixed mooring angle 30 27 and wave steepness 0 03 it should be noticed that before conducting the formal model tests all the tension sensors have been set to 0 at still water condition for every case therefore during the formal tests all the recorded values only include the wave induced dynamic tensions and exclude the initial tension offset since the mooring line cannot be compressed axially there will be no pressure output negative values in fig 14 mean that the actual tension value is lower than the initial tension offset which is presented in table 3 it can be found that at both the waveward and the leeward side of the breakwater the mooring lines give almost comparable amount but opposite phase of tension in terms of both upper and lower all the upper tensions are larger than those of lower side the mooring line tension is relatively stable and the waveform also has a regular shape however strongly nonlinearity can be captured this is especially true for longer wave incident which give more instantaneous force and overlapped peak in the crests taking the mooring lines at the waveward side ml1 and ml2 as an example fig 15 further show the corresponding spectra analyses of fig 14 clearly mooring lines at both upper and lower side have an exactly equal value of dynamic response frequency the nonlinearity of the mooring line tension enlarges with increasing the incident wave period at t 2 4 s an obvious 3rd order component can even be observed the second order component reaches the same order of magnitude as the first order component for further analyzing the amplitude and phase relation of tensions for the four mooring lines it is more convenient to use a normalized tension and a phase difference to compare the tensions among the four mooring lines two parameters are defined as follow 2 r i a i t a m l 1 t 3 δ φ i φ i φ m l 1 where r is the tension amplitude ratio a i t the amplitude of the i th mooring line tension mli a m l 1 t means the tension amplitude of the 1 th mooring line ml1 δ φ 0 π is the phase difference φ i the initial phase of the i th mooring line tension mli φ m l 1 means the initial phase of the 1 th mooring line tension ml1 i represents the numerical order of the mooring line for example ml1 ml2 ml3 ml4 we evaluate the tension amplitude and phase difference for all the mooring line tension based on the ml1 which is located at the waveward upper side of the floating body fig 16 a give the tension amplitude ratio versus incident wave period for mooring line ml1 ml4 with the fixed mooring angle 30 27 and wave steepness 0 03 at both upper and lower side of the floating body the mooring lines at waveward side give almost comparable amount of tension with those of leeward side for ml2 and ml4 the tension amplitude ratios increase with increasing wave period peak at t 1 8 s and t 2 4 s and tend to be stable as wave period increases this phenomenon is accord with the floating body roll as shown in fig 13 c suggesting that the mooring line tension at lower side of the floating breakwater in this study has close relationships to the roll motion for ml3 the tension amplitude ratios decrease with increasing wave period and tend to be stable with increasing wave period interestingly at t 1 8 s and t 2 4 s the tension amplitude ratios of ml3 have trend to be much close to those of ml1 which is consistent with phenomenon of ml2 and ml4 in comparison of the tension amplitude ratio the tension amplitudes of ml2 and ml4 are approximately 0 2 0 5 times of those of ml1 while for ml3 the multiple is approximately 0 85 1 0 comparing the tension amplitude ratios of ml1 ml4 also give a fact that the roll of the floating body is an adverse factor for mooring line this is another indication of how important the used anti rolling tank of the water ballast type breakwater is as expected in yang et al 2018 correspondingly fig 16 b gives the phase difference versus incident wave period as expect at both waveward and leeward side of the breakwater the phase differences of mooring lines between upper and lower side are quite small the tension also presents a phase delay of approximately 125 180 between the waveward and leeward this phenomenon is a bit different with the conventional non water ballast type floating breakwater he et al 2012 or other floating structure song et al 2018 that the waveward tension has a normative π phase lag with leeward tension this can also be attributed to the ballasted water sloshes leading to an opposite force against the motion of the floating body the variation of tension with relative width w l is given in fig 17 where fig 17 a c and e denote the mooring angle are set as 30 27 and fig 17 b d and f denote the mooring angle are set as 60 55 the wave steepness are 0 02 0 03 and 0 04 respectively for a convenience analysis wave period and wave height are nondimensionalized as the relative width w l and the wave steepness h l clearly the mooring line tension decreases as relative width increases basically and increases with increasing wave steepness h l it is well known that wave power is directly proportional to square of the wave period or the wave height as the wave steepness increases or relative water depth decreases under the constant water depth the larger wave energy has an impact force on the floating breakwater thereby pulling the mooring line a greater tension furthermore the tension of mooring line and the discrepancy for the upper ones ml1 and ml3 and lower ones ml2 and ml4 decrease with increasing mooring angle when comparing different mooring angles as shown in fig 17 however the tendency is quite different with the previous researches that the mooring line tension has little relationship with the mooring angle see e g he et al 2013 loukogeorgaki et al 2014 in previous studies the main difference is that the mooring lines are designed similarly to the ship anchorage system where mooring lines are in a relaxed state in static water and even have a certain dragging length for the mooring line itself the tension will only be generated under tension state thus in the previous studies the anchor tension depends largely on the length of the mooring line instead of mooring angle however mooring lines in this study are designed to be always in a tight state in still water consequently a certain amount of floating body motion will inevitably produce different mooring line tension for different mooring angles 3 4 water pressure distribution on the floating body the floating body used in the present experiment mainly includes a floating box and a vertical plate fixed at the bottom of the box as shown in fig 4 when water wave interacts with the floating breakwater some of the wave energy is reflected back part of the energy continues to propagate forward through the breakwater and the remainder is directly dissipated during interaction of the external waves and inner ballasted water on the floating box during the final detailed design phase for a practical floating breakwater project in addition to obtain the mooring line tension it is important to know the distribution of water pressure impact directly on the floating body in this study the pressure loads on the floating box mainly include the incoming wave force impacts on the outer surface and the liquid sloshing force on the inner surface whilst pressure loads on the vertical plate includes the impulse force of wave crest and the recovery force of wave trough for the floating box the mechanical mechanism of water pressure is quite complicated at the outside of the floating box when wave crest begins to impact the surface of the floating body a high strength instantaneous dynamic water pressure will be generated as water particle to deviate from the direction of the floating body movement dynamic water pressure gradually changes its direction from positive impact pressure to negative and moves forward along the bottom of the vertical plate as waves propagation the negative dynamic water pressure at the outside of the floating box peaks as water particle move to wave trough at the inside of the floating box the inner ballasted water sloshes as the floating body moves periodically under waves action when the inner water impacts the box body a positive water pressure is generated and when the water returns the water pressure becomes a negative value fig 18 presents atypical time series of the wave pressure for different points at both inner and outside of the floating box with wave period and wave height equal to 2 0 s and 0 1 m respectively as expected wave pressure on the floating box is relatively stable and the waveform keep as regular shape similar to the floating body motion and tension of the mooring line strongly nonlinear characteristics in the water pressure can be captured this is due to wave breaking occurrence and the sloshing i e fluid structure interaction between the floating box and the ballasted water inside for purpose of further analyze the distribution characteristics of wave pressure on the floating body the average peak values of the positive and negative pressure under different incoming wave conditions are obtained to draw the wave pressure distribution envelope diagram fig 19 plots the envelope diagram of wave pressure distribution at each measuring point see fig 7 of the floating breakwater under different wave steepness with the fixed mooring angle 30 27 in which no 1 no 6 denote the waveward measuring points no 9 no 14 denote the leeward measuring points while no 7 and no 8 denote the measuring points at the vertical plate clearly the water pressure increases with increasing wave steepness the maxima of the water pressure appear at the waveward side which is near the still water surface with the increase of the submerged water depth the pressure decreases accordingly the pressures on the waveward side and the leeward side are generally consistent pressures on the outside of the floating structure are significantly larger than those of inside meanwhile the positive pressure peak is greater than the negative pressure peak at the corner between the floating box and the vertical plate due to the turbulent effect of the water wave the pressure changes sharply leading to a snap value and the distribution regularity is not obvious compared with other places similar to the tension of mooring line water pressure on the floating body is also affected by wave condition and anchor condition for analyzing the water pressure sensitivity of the floating body structure fig 20 present the variation of water pressure with relative width w l for selected measuring points op2 op8 ip2 and ip8 see fig 7 under the mooring angle 30 27 likewise nondimensionalized parameters of the relative width w l and the wave steepness h l are adopted it is found that the water pressure loads on the floating box and vertical plate decreases with relative width w l increasing basically which is quite similar with features of the floating body motion and mooring line tension fig 21 selectively presents the pressure variation of floating body on points op2 op8 and op13 for different mooring angles it is obvious that the water pressure increases with decreasing mooring angle and the discrepancy between 60 55 and 30 27 appears a growing tendency with wave period according to the above analyses the relationship between water pressures on the floating body with the mooring angle is basically the similar with that of the mooring line tension which fully reflects a good consistency of dynamic performance for the floating breakwater 4 conclusions in this study a series of two dimensional wave flume model tests with scale of 1 25 have been carried out to get insights into the dynamic response mechanisms quantitatively for a water ballast type floating breakwater the motion and water pressure of the floating body tensions of the mooring lines have been systemically examined with aspect to different parameters including the structural parameters and wave conditions etc the natural dynamic characteristics of the moored floating system have been studied by a free decay experiment a tension amplitude ratio and its phase difference have also been defined to analyze the fairlead tensions between different mooing lines for both waveward leeward and upper lower side of the floating body furthermore the external and inner water pressure and its distribution on the floating box and vertical plate have been presented the following conclusions can be drawn the sway and roll of the floating body present strongly nonlinearity due to water on deck and sloshing occurrence the sway increases with the wave period while the mean value is not affected significantly by the wave period the roll increases first and then maintain stable as wave period increases the heave maintains a downward mean position drifting from the free surface due to the mean drift force wave period has a significant effect to the mean heave value and the peak value occurs at its natural period which warns a risk for the floating body grounding during use period it also impacts the erosion and deposition of the seabed in the long term four rows of mooring lines were used to connect the floating body which leads to the mechanical mechanism of the mooring line becoming increasingly complicated at both waveward and leeward side of the breakwater the mooring lines give almost comparable amount but opposite phase of tension in terms of both upper and lower all the upper tensions are larger than those of lower side but the response frequency is almost equivalent the upper mooring lines tension decrease and tend to be stable with increasing wave period while the lower tension increases and tend to be stable with increasing wave period which has close relationships to the roll of the floating body this is another indication of how important the used anti rolling tank of the water ballast type breakwater is similar to the floating body motion and tension of the mooring line the water pressure reveals strongly nonlinear characteristics which is due to wave breaking and the sloshing occurrence the water pressures on the outside of the floating structure are significantly larger than those of inside the maxima appear at the waveward side which is near the still water surface owing to the turbulence at the corner between the floating box and the vertical plate the pressure changes sharply leading to a snap value in general the mooring line tension and water pressure of the floating body decrease with increasing relative width w l and mooring angle θ but increase with increasing wave steepness h l which fully reflects a good consistency of dynamic performance for the floating breakwater the present results in this study demonstrate that the water ballast tank can effectively improve the dynamic performance for a floating breakwater which provide a database for its detailed designing in terms of structural and material selection

20644,water ballast type floating breakwater has a wide range of applications due to its good wave attenuation performance in this study a series of physical model tests have been carried out to get insights into the dynamic response characteristics quantitatively of the floating breakwater and tension of the mooring lines the external and inner water pressure and its distribution on the floating body are presented the results show that the sway and roll motions of the floating body exhibit strongly nonlinear characteristics as a result of water on deck and sloshing occurrence the heave motion maintains a downward drifting and the greatest heave amplitude occurs when the wave period is close to the heave natural period at both waveward and leeward side of the floating body the mooring lines give almost comparable amplitudes but opposite phase of tension in terms of both upper and lower the maximum water pressures appear at the waveward side which is near the still water level at the corner between the floating box and the vertical plate the pressure changes sharply leading to a snap value overall the results in this study provide a database for detailed design for the water ballast type floating breakwaters in future structural and material selection keywords floating breakwater water ballast type dynamic response experimental study 1 introduction floating breakwaters have been increasingly used as an alternative structure in ports or coastal protection which display advantage in terms of construction economics and ecology they are especially competitive in regions with poor foundations deep water ice problems and large tidal range and high water quality requirement when compared to the traditional ponderous bottom mounded breakwaters as a key planned port project in fuzhou port east china songxia port area has deep water and convenient channel for ships entering and leaving the port the songxia port area is to be built in three stages by using an encircled breakwater to enclose a semi enclosed sea area to provide a relatively stable condition for ship docking see fig 1 at present the first and second phase of the breakwater has been completed and under construction respectively using gravity type structure which prevents waves invasion from the north and east respectively as a result the construction of gravity type breakwater hinders the water exchange of the port area leading to deterioration of water quality the tidal range of songxia port area is quite large reaching up to 8 10 m if the traditional gravity type is still adopted in the third phase of the breakwater project higher construction costs must be paid to prevent wave overtopping during high tide most importantly the proposed third phase breakwater of the songxia port area which prevents wave invasion from the south is close to a marine ecological protection zone the traditional gravity structure will further hinder the water exchange of the port area in the meantime large scale construction will seriously damage the local marine ecological environment to address this issue the floating breakwater scheme has been put on the agenda which is expected to not only reduce the damage to the marine environment but also greatly reduce the construction cost in the past few decades much research effort has gone into aspects related to the conceptual design of the floating breakwater lots of floating breakwaters with novel configurations have been proposed under various circumstances for a better performance and or high cost effectiveness for example the

integrated breakwater wec system zhao et al 2019 furthermore some novel shapes have been proposed e g π shaped floating breakwaters gesraha 2006 r shaped floating breakwaters wang and sun 2010 t shaped floating breakwaters zhan et al 2017 and inversed t shaped floating breakwaters neelamani and rajendran 2002 chen et al 2016 deng et al 2019 etc for the existing floating breakwater structure multifarious wave attenuation mechanisms have been utilized including the wave reflection wave energy dissipating and limit the generation of radiation waves etc most of them are suitable for short wave condition and waters where the tidal range is small however there is still a problem that limits the application in relative longer wave and larger tide range environment furthermore the effectiveness exertion of wave attenuation is limited by the materials used as the conventional material steel or reinforced concrete must contend with the fact that the former is highly corrosive in the seawater and the latter is fragile in wave dynamic loading inspired by the anti rolling tank which has been widely used in the field of naval architecture moaleji and greig 2007 a water ballast type floating breakwater has been firstly proposed by yang et al 2018 the main feature of this new structure is the use of a ballasted water tank and a vertical plate which allow for stronger water vortex liquid sloshing wave overtopping and wave breaking developing surrounding or within the structure for the restriction of the floating body the mooring chain is designed to be dual tensional in order to obtain more restrictions on the movements of floating breakwater for the material a kind of reinforced composite material which has high performance in corrosion resistance crashworthiness and fatigue resistance is used which allows the floating box conventionally ballasted with fixed rocks or sands to be ballasted with the low cost seawater these improvements effectively improve the performance in reducing the wave transmission currently the water ballast type floating breakwater has been selected as one of the important alternatives for the songxia port the hydrodynamic effectiveness has also been systemically investigated through a series of experiments yang et al 2018 using a coupled sph mooring model liu and wang 2020a b numerically investigated the wave attenuation performances and hydrodynamics of the water ballast submerged moored box type floating breakwaters with different shapes of cross sections these results support that the new floating breakwater has competitive effectiveness when compared to the traditional floating breakwaters however there are limited investigations on the dynamic response of the moored floating body under different wave conditions which is actually critical for the security of the application for practical application of a floating breakwater how to ensure its safety in their life cycle is most important issue including safety of the mooring line and the floating box structure for example whether the floating body will ground during use and significantly impact the erosion and deposition of the seabed over the long term when the mooring lines and floating box exceed their strength and fatigue limits in practice however it must be aware that many nonlinear phenomena occur along with green water loadings on the small freeboard floating structures in rough waves such as slamming violent impact force wave breaking water air mixing and associated turbulence zhao et al 2014 furthermore the presence of ballast water significantly increases the complexity of dynamic response for the floating box structure although a lot of numerical model studies have been proposed to address the wave induced nonlinear motions for the2d floating body sueyoshi et al 2008 hu and kashiwagi 2009 zhao et al 2014 in general it is still very challenging to set up a numerical simulation to predict its 6 dof motions mooring line tensions and structural stress accurately this is especially true for a multiple moored water ballast type floating body therefore in this study a series of experiments have been conducted to examine the dynamic responses of the water ballast type floating breakwater exposed to regular waves this study aims to provide a database for detailed designing for the water ballast type floating breakwaters in future structural and material selection experiments for 2d cases have been carried out in a wave flume the action of regular waves with wide ranges of wave heights and periods has been considered emphasis are given on the dynamic response characteristics quantitatively including the motion and water pressure of the floating body tension of the mooring lines to investigate the effect with aspect to different parameters i e structural parameters and wave conditions etc a free decay test has been carried out to study the natural dynamic characteristics of the moored floating system a tension amplitude ratio and its phase difference have also been defined to analyze the fairlead tensions between different mooing lines for both waveward leeward and upper lower side of the floating body in addition the external and inner water pressure and its distribution on the floating box and vertical plate have been presented to get insights into the dynamic mechanisms finally conclusions were drawn 2 experimental setup and conditions in the present study a series of hydrodynamic experiment were carried out to investigate the dynamic response of a water ballast type floating breakwater parameters of the floating breakwater and wave conditions are based on an actual engineering in the following sub sections the experimental set up and experimental conditions of the present investigation are described part of this description has been also presented in yang et al 2018 2 1 model of floating body and mooring line the floating body and mooring line model were constructed based on a typical prototype which is planned to utilize in songxia port of fujian province coastal areas in china the whole model was scaled following froude similitude with the geometrical scale of λ 1 25 a sketch of the floating breakwater model used is shown in fig 2 the dimension of the floating box is 0 4 m wide and 0 16 m high which has the ratio of wide to high of 2 5 for the convenience of fabrication and adjustment the model was made of resin matrix composite material built as two independent but symmetrical long parts and these two parts ultimately assembled together before putting into the wave flume each long part was separated into five water tanks by four bulkheads these water tanks can be injected with liquid like water to change the draft of floating breakwater after the completion of water injection the top of each long part was covered by a cover board a vertical plate was mounted to the bottom of box structure with the height of 0 12 m for improving the structural integrity and strength several rib plates were fixed between the bottom of box structure and the vertical plate the bulkheads and rib plates were made of 5 mm thickness and the other components of the model were made of 10 mm thickness while for achieving the target total dry mass of 21 82 kg this kind of floating breakwater is referred to as water ballast type which use several wave attenuation mechanisms for instance wave reflection water sloshing wave breaking and wave current interactions more details about the model structure or design principles can also be found in yang et al 2018 it is well known that the tension status of the mooring line directly affects the movement of the moored floating breakwater which further significantly affects the performance of the breakwater in wave attenuation in order to improve the performance the floating body was designed as taut moored four sets of mooring lines were installed on each side of the floating breakwater and a total of eight sets four in the waveward side and four in the leeward side of the floating breakwater were applied each set consists of two mooring lines one connecting to the bottom edge of box structure and the other one connecting to the vertical plate the other ends of both mooring lines were together fastened to an anchor which fixed on the flume bottom the horizontal distance of anchor to origin is 3 28 m this kind of tensional mooring configuration is expected to effectively restrict the sway and roll motions thus can reduce the motion radiated waves and is especially suitable for the floating breakwater hanging attachment underneath mani 1991 following the prototype the total length of each mooring line l 1 was selected equal to 3 57 m for the upper one and 3 87 m for the lower one l 2 namely the length of the mooring line was 4 5 times of the water depth for each mooring line the whole line was hanging in the water i e no length lying at the bottom the model mooring line was made of stainless steel with a submerged weight per unit length of 94 72 g m such that the mass per unit length satisfies the gravity similarity since its total length is limited the deformation of mooring line is tiny and the elastic deformation is negligible therefore it is impractical to simulate the elastic deformation of the prototype chain by using the model chain directly for this reason a wire spring was mounted on the bottom of the model chain for compensating the elastic deformation in consistency with the prototype according to wilson equation the tension deformation curve of the simulating lines is calculated as 1 t m c p d p 2 δ s s n λ 3 in which t m means the model tension while δs s is the elongation c p is the elasticity modulus d p is the diameter of prototype mooring line n constant as 1 5 on the basis of the prototype wire and λ is the model scale the mooring lines were calibrated by selecting different linear springs in order to match the target elastic characteristics example of relationship between the measured spring elongation and the spring tension elastic deformation of the spring is shown in fig 3 it can be seen that the theoretical and simulated tension deformation agree well the deformation curve of the spring is basically linear when the tension is less than 150 n which indicates that the reasonable of using spring to simulate mooring line stiffness the model rigidity coefficient is approximate to k 99 0 kg m which correspond to 2 elongation of the prototype mooring line moreover it should be noted that the model chain s material should be selected to maintain the flexibility of the chain in the prototype the schematic diagram for layout of the physical model can be found in fig 4 the related parameters of the floating breakwater model which is adopted in the physical experiment are exhibited in table 1 to acquire an accurate dynamic response of the floating breakwater the deviation detection for model parameters was carried out during the manufacture period and the error range was controlled within 2 2 2 experimental facility and setup the experiments were carried out in the 2d wave flume of the national engineering laboratory for port hydraulic construction technology tianjin research institute for water transport engineering m o t in china scales of the wave flume are 90 m long 1 0 m wide and 2 0 m deep at one side of the wave flume a piston type wavemaker was installed which is capable of generating uni directional waves at the other side an artificial gravel sloping beach 1 10 was mounted to absorb the reflected waves indeed this kind of small slope with high porosity beach prevents wave reflections effectively besides reflected waves by the floating breakwater were propagating toward to the wavemaker therefore rather than the reflection from the dissipation beach the reflection from the wavemaker was the main concern during the experiments to eliminate the wave re reflection generated by the wavemaker an active wave absorption control method was used in the wavemaker system more details can also be found in yang et al 2018 which allows for generation of incident waves and absorption of reflected waves synchronously fig 5 shows a sketch of layout about the wave flume experimental setup and the definition of coordinate system the floating model was 55 m away from the wavemaker and kept as an equilibrium position by a series of tensional mooring lines from the top view of the layout fig 5 b it can be seen that four ball bearings were mounted on the two sides of the floating box which has the aim to sustain the breakwater along to the flume walls and to avoid the collision between floating model and walls in the experiment the ball bearings on the top part of the breakwater have all directions to rotate therefore the friction between the floating body and flume walls was minimized and could be ignored at the same time its only 15 mm thick of exposed portion for each ball bearing after installation corresponding to the wave flume so that very few incoming waves would across directly the gap between the floating body and flume walls in this manner the 3d motion responses of the floating breakwater tend towards 2d responses he et al 2017 the measurement instrument consists of a twenty eight water pressure sensor wp for measuring the water pressure and consequently the water pressure at the inner wall and at the outer wall of the floating box are obtained b eight one dimensional s beam tension and compression type load cells lc for measuring the mooring lines tension and c nine wave gauges for recording the wave elevation at selected points in the waveward and leeward side of the floating body d a fastrak motion tracking system mts for measuring the motion responses of the floating body a sketch for showing the position of the wp is given in fig 6 there are two kinds of measure points distributed on the floating body i e the outside measure points op and inside points ip in the present experiment the wp is a piezoresistive type with the pressure capacity equaling 100 pa all the water pressure data were recorded with a sampling frequency of 100 hz the actual installation photo of the water pressure sensor and the mts is shown in fig 7 as to the lc eight lcs capacity 100 n were installed at each top of the mooring line four lcs were installed at the waveward part of the floating body while the rest four lcs were installed at the leeward side all the lcs were put in the middle of the model as shown in fig 5 lower part detail installation method of the mooring line the lc and the spring are sketched in fig 8 four mooring lines ml1 ml2 ml3 and ml4 which correspond to the waveward upper waveward lower leeward upper and leeward lower side of the floating body respectively were representatively selected for analyzing the mooring line tension subsequently all the mooring line tension data were recorded with a sampling frequency of 100 hz nine wave gauges resistance type were used to record the wave time series in which one was mounted on the wave paddle for data feedback of the active wave absorption controlling and others were placed at both waveward side and leeward side of the floating breakwater for calibration of the incoming wave and measuring the wave field at specify point the time series of wave elevation were recorded with a sampling frequency of 50 hz for measuring the motion response of the floating model in the wave flume experiment a fastrak motion tracking system mts was used to measure the 6 dofs it should be mentioned that in the present research the motion responses of floating model were reduced to a two dimensional problem and only the heave sway and roll motion were useful all the motion results were recorded with a sampling frequency of 100 hz a monitor a data logger and a computer were adopted to record the time series of wave surface while another data logger and computer were used to record data related with the wp the lc and the mts synchronously the used floating body and relevant measurement instruments including the water pressure sensor wp the s type load cells lc the wave gauge wg and the motion tracking system mts are pictured in fig 9 2 3 experimental conditions in this study only the regular waves were considered throughout the experiment the water depth h remains unchanged as 0 6 m the wave period ranged from 1 2 s to 2 8 s while the wave height changes from 0 04 m to 0 26 m to control the wave steepness h l where l is the wave length the combination of incoming wave period and height was chosen for each wave condition detailed arrangement of wave parameter could be found in table 2 each wave period was combined with three wave steepness values h l 0 02 0 03 0 04 to explore the combined effect of the wave parameter and the angle of different mooring lines in the present experiment the mooring angle θ 1 θ 2 were taken as 30 27 and 60 55 respectively see fig 4 so that a total of forty eight cases were considered before conducting the case study the incident wave parameters were carefully calibrated and the deviations were controlled within 5 prior to the installation of floating body the incident wave was calibrated by wave gauges placed where the floating model would be installed after installing the floating body and before conducting the formal model tests all the load cells were carefully adjusted to balance the initial tension of the mooring line for the waveward and leeward the initial mooring line tension is presented in table 3 moreover to avoid the influence of zero drift of the recording system all the sensors including water pressure mooring line tension wave gauge and motion tracking were set to 0 at still water condition for every tested case therefore during the formal tests all the recorded values actually include the wave induced dynamic variables solely and exclude the initial offset 3 results 3 1 free decay test to investigate the dynamic characteristics of the floating breakwater system the natural period and damping ratio of the floating body were identified firstly a decay test for the moored floating body was considered two mooring angles θ 1 θ 2 30 27 and 60 55 were considered in the decay tests the floating breakwater was forced by a small initial displacement and then released as the effect of hydrostatic restoring force and elasticity of the mooring system the floating model gradually returns to the mean position as an example time histories of the heave and roll displacement in water for mooring angle 30 27 are depicted in fig 10 the natural periods of the floating body can be obtained by calculating the average period of all the oscillation processes using the zero crossing method correspondingly the natural periods of sway roll and heave for the floating body are shown in table 4 the natural period of heave is smaller than sway and roll as expected the natural period decease for the heave but increase for the sway and roll with increasing mooring angle this is mainly due to the restoring stiffness in vertical is larger than in horizontal and the discrepancy of restoring stiffness increases with the mooring angle the damping ratio of heave is also smaller than sway and roll however as the mooring angle increases the effect of the mooring angle to the damping ratio is weak 3 2 motion of the floating body as an example fig 11 demonstrates the time series of floating body motion with wave condition of t 2 2 s h 0 16 m with the mooring angle θ 1 θ 2 being 30 27 obviously the motion of floating body shows a remarkable regular change under incoming regular waves and the motion period is in accord with wave period it can be clearly seen that a new mean heave position drifting appears which are caused by the mean drift force the time series of sway and roll show a strongly nonlinearity as a result of water on deck and sloshing occurrence i e interaction between the floating box and the ballasted water inside e g hu and kashiwagi 2009 while the water on deck has an insignificant effect on the heave which can be attributed to the dynamic response mechanism of sway and roll are quite complicated when compared to heave for the water ballast type floating breakwater this phenomenon is probably different with the conventional box type floating breakwater or other floating structure song et al 2018 according to yang et al 2018 the wave attenuation mechanisms of the water ballast type breakwater including a wave reflection by the floating box and a middle vertical plate b water vortex generated by the bottom plate of floating box and the vertical plate c wave overtopping and wave breaking d sloshing occurs in the water ballast which weakens the motion induced radiated waves in addition the water ballast is a major component for the floating breakwater and it has a significant effect to the motion response of floating breakwater as to the heave motion the movement form is relatively simple since only the bottom spring of the mooring line provides the restoring force the inner ballasted water move up and down with the floating box and remains in a relatively dormant state however the inner water injected the box has the purpose of ballast and obtains an additional effect of making the box as an anti rolling structure which is more stable because of the ballasted water sloshes against the motion of sway and roll and it also makes the movement form of sway and roll highly nonlinear and more complicated evidences of the above phenomenon can be further found in fig 12 where the corresponding motion energy spectra analyses of fig 11 are given for the heave motion response the first order component which is governed by the incident wave frequency can be clearly observed the low frequency 0 hz component corresponds to the above mentioned mean heave position drifting however the sway and roll motion exhibit interesting remarkable high frequency 2nd order components respectively beside the first order component the secondary harmonics in the energy spectra up to one third of the first order value which should be considered in the engineering design there are two possible reasons for the secondary harmonics firstly for the motion of the water ballast type floating breakwater the motion phase of the inner water is opposite to that of the waves outside however the natural frequency of the inner water motion is 0 85 hz that is approximately 2 0 2 3 times that of the whole floating body see detailed discussion in yang et al 2018 which probably leads to the phenomenon of sub peak in the motion of the floating body secondly the motion of the floating body was restricted by four mooring lines on either side of it the tension of the four mooring lines have some phase difference therefore during the movement of the floating body the sudden tension of the mooring lines probably also makes the floating body appear higher order motion the dynamic displacement of the floating body was obtained under regular waves with the same wave steepness of 0 03 the variation of extremum motion response with wave period is shown in fig 13 the results show that the sway has growing tendency with increasing wave period fig 13 a to estimate the effect of mean drift force the average value of sway is also present in the figure it is interesting to find that the mean sway is quite small and is not affected significantly by the wave period this phenomenon is different compared with those of song et al 2018 in which the sway presents a considerable mean drift force traditionally for short waves relatively large motion of the floating body results in greater diffraction effects and greater mean 2nd order horizontal forces e g pinkster 1979 however in this paper a distinguishing feature is that the mooring lines are designed to be tensional rather than flabby in previous study and there is almost no free mooring line lying at the bottom therefore the wave induced mean drift forces can be effectively counteracted by the mooring line tensions the heave motion of floating body enlarges with the increase of the wave period before reaches the peak value of motion resonance at the natural period of the floating model fig 13 b it is higher than the wave amplitude and then tends to be equal to the wave amplitude as waves become longer in the downward direction the negative mean heave is mainly induced by the impact pressures of water wave overtopping on floating box wave period has a considerable effect to the mean heave motion and the peak value occurs at its natural period it means that the wave period plays a significant role for heave which directly affects the water wave overtopping amount on the floating body of particular note is that the greatest downward mean heave motion occurs under the wave condition of t t heave such fact has not been noticed so far in previous research to the author s knowledge the greatest mean heave in downward direction leads to the floating breakwater submerging in water and risk of the floating body grounding during use period which also impacts the erosion and deposition of the seabed in the long term the roll increases first and then maintain stable as wave period increases it approaches the local peaks about wave period of 1 8 s and 2 4 s as shown in fig 13 c this phenomenon is quite similar with those of journée 1991 which found that for longer waves of t t roll the roll amplitude is trending to the wave steepness and decreases with wavelength increasing since the mooring lines are designed to be tensional the wave induced mean drift force can be effectively counteracted by the mooring line force as expected the mean roll is closed to zero in addition from the free decay tests it has small discrepancies between resonant periods of roll and heave for the floating body and the natural periods which could be effected by coupling of wave actions and the hydrodynamic forces the sway heave and roll response amplitude operators rao of the floating body were obtained with the same wave steepness of 0 03 as plotted in fig 13 d results again confirm that the heave amplitude increases with increasing wave period and peaks at its natural period of 2 0 s the sway exhibits a dynamic magnification near short wave of 1 2 s beside the first order dynamic magnification near short wave of 2 8 s the rao of roll motion decreases as the wave period increases and basically stabilizes till wave period equals to 2 0 s 3 3 tensions of the mooring lines another key difference of the water ballast type floating breakwater in the present experiment with conventional ones is that we used four rows of mooring lines waveward upper ml1 waveward lower ml2 leeward upper ml3 and leeward lower ml4 to connect the floating body as murali and mani 1997 leading to the mechanical mechanism of the mooring line becoming increasingly complicated the mechanical property of mooring line is very important because it affects its strength design and fatigue analysis in murali and mani 1997 the effect of stiffness of mooring lines on wave transmission coefficient was analyzed carefully but unfortunately the tensions of mooring line were not measured in this section we will give a detailed discussion on the tensions of the mooring lines as an example fig 14 firstly shows the time series of tension with ml1 ml4 for selected different wave cases with the fixed mooring angle 30 27 and wave steepness 0 03 it should be noticed that before conducting the formal model tests all the tension sensors have been set to 0 at still water condition for every case therefore during the formal tests all the recorded values only include the wave induced dynamic tensions and exclude the initial tension offset since the mooring line cannot be compressed axially there will be no pressure output negative values in fig 14 mean that the actual tension value is lower than the initial tension offset which is presented in table 3 it can be found that at both the waveward and the leeward side of the breakwater the mooring lines give almost comparable amount but opposite phase of tension in terms of both upper and lower all the upper tensions are larger than those of lower side the mooring line tension is relatively stable and the waveform also has a regular shape however strongly nonlinearity can be captured this is especially true for longer wave incident which give more instantaneous force and overlapped peak in the crests taking the mooring lines at the waveward side ml1 and ml2 as an example fig 15 further show the corresponding spectra analyses of fig 14 clearly mooring lines at both upper and lower side have an exactly equal value of dynamic response frequency the nonlinearity of the mooring line tension enlarges with increasing the incident wave period at t 2 4 s an obvious 3rd order component can even be observed the second order component reaches the same order of magnitude as the first order component for further analyzing the amplitude and phase relation of tensions for the four mooring lines it is more convenient to use a normalized tension and a phase difference to compare the tensions among the four mooring lines two parameters are defined as follow 2 r i a i t a m l 1 t 3 δ φ i φ i φ m l 1 where r is the tension amplitude ratio a i t the amplitude of the i th mooring line tension mli a m l 1 t means the tension amplitude of the 1 th mooring line ml1 δ φ 0 π is the phase difference φ i the initial phase of the i th mooring line tension mli φ m l 1 means the initial phase of the 1 th mooring line tension ml1 i represents the numerical order of the mooring line for example ml1 ml2 ml3 ml4 we evaluate the tension amplitude and phase difference for all the mooring line tension based on the ml1 which is located at the waveward upper side of the floating body fig 16 a give the tension amplitude ratio versus incident wave period for mooring line ml1 ml4 with the fixed mooring angle 30 27 and wave steepness 0 03 at both upper and lower side of the floating body the mooring lines at waveward side give almost comparable amount of tension with those of leeward side for ml2 and ml4 the tension amplitude ratios increase with increasing wave period peak at t 1 8 s and t 2 4 s and tend to be stable as wave period increases this phenomenon is accord with the floating body roll as shown in fig 13 c suggesting that the mooring line tension at lower side of the floating breakwater in this study has close relationships to the roll motion for ml3 the tension amplitude ratios decrease with increasing wave period and tend to be stable with increasing wave period interestingly at t 1 8 s and t 2 4 s the tension amplitude ratios of ml3 have trend to be much close to those of ml1 which is consistent with phenomenon of ml2 and ml4 in comparison of the tension amplitude ratio the tension amplitudes of ml2 and ml4 are approximately 0 2 0 5 times of those of ml1 while for ml3 the multiple is approximately 0 85 1 0 comparing the tension amplitude ratios of ml1 ml4 also give a fact that the roll of the floating body is an adverse factor for mooring line this is another indication of how important the used anti rolling tank of the water ballast type breakwater is as expected in yang et al 2018 correspondingly fig 16 b gives the phase difference versus incident wave period as expect at both waveward and leeward side of the breakwater the phase differences of mooring lines between upper and lower side are quite small the tension also presents a phase delay of approximately 125 180 between the waveward and leeward this phenomenon is a bit different with the conventional non water ballast type floating breakwater he et al 2012 or other floating structure song et al 2018 that the waveward tension has a normative π phase lag with leeward tension this can also be attributed to the ballasted water sloshes leading to an opposite force against the motion of the floating body the variation of tension with relative width w l is given in fig 17 where fig 17 a c and e denote the mooring angle are set as 30 27 and fig 17 b d and f denote the mooring angle are set as 60 55 the wave steepness are 0 02 0 03 and 0 04 respectively for a convenience analysis wave period and wave height are nondimensionalized as the relative width w l and the wave steepness h l clearly the mooring line tension decreases as relative width increases basically and increases with increasing wave steepness h l it is well known that wave power is directly proportional to square of the wave period or the wave height as the wave steepness increases or relative water depth decreases under the constant water depth the larger wave energy has an impact force on the floating breakwater thereby pulling the mooring line a greater tension furthermore the tension of mooring line and the discrepancy for the upper ones ml1 and ml3 and lower ones ml2 and ml4 decrease with increasing mooring angle when comparing different mooring angles as shown in fig 17 however the tendency is quite different with the previous researches that the mooring line tension has little relationship with the mooring angle see e g he et al 2013 loukogeorgaki et al 2014 in previous studies the main difference is that the mooring lines are designed similarly to the ship anchorage system where mooring lines are in a relaxed state in static water and even have a certain dragging length for the mooring line itself the tension will only be generated under tension state thus in the previous studies the anchor tension depends largely on the length of the mooring line instead of mooring angle however mooring lines in this study are designed to be always in a tight state in still water consequently a certain amount of floating body motion will inevitably produce different mooring line tension for different mooring angles 3 4 water pressure distribution on the floating body the floating body used in the present experiment mainly includes a floating box and a vertical plate fixed at the bottom of the box as shown in fig 4 when water wave interacts with the floating breakwater some of the wave energy is reflected back part of the energy continues to propagate forward through the breakwater and the remainder is directly dissipated during interaction of the external waves and inner ballasted water on the floating box during the final detailed design phase for a practical floating breakwater project in addition to obtain the mooring line tension it is important to know the distribution of water pressure impact directly on the floating body in this study the pressure loads on the floating box mainly include the incoming wave force impacts on the outer surface and the liquid sloshing force on the inner surface whilst pressure loads on the vertical plate includes the impulse force of wave crest and the recovery force of wave trough for the floating box the mechanical mechanism of water pressure is quite complicated at the outside of the floating box when wave crest begins to impact the surface of the floating body a high strength instantaneous dynamic water pressure will be generated as water particle to deviate from the direction of the floating body movement dynamic water pressure gradually changes its direction from positive impact pressure to negative and moves forward along the bottom of the vertical plate as waves propagation the negative dynamic water pressure at the outside of the floating box peaks as water particle move to wave trough at the inside of the floating box the inner ballasted water sloshes as the floating body moves periodically under waves action when the inner water impacts the box body a positive water pressure is generated and when the water returns the water pressure becomes a negative value fig 18 presents atypical time series of the wave pressure for different points at both inner and outside of the floating box with wave period and wave height equal to 2 0 s and 0 1 m respectively as expected wave pressure on the floating box is relatively stable and the waveform keep as regular shape similar to the floating body motion and tension of the mooring line strongly nonlinear characteristics in the water pressure can be captured this is due to wave breaking occurrence and the sloshing i e fluid structure interaction between the floating box and the ballasted water inside for purpose of further analyze the distribution characteristics of wave pressure on the floating body the average peak values of the positive and negative pressure under different incoming wave conditions are obtained to draw the wave pressure distribution envelope diagram fig 19 plots the envelope diagram of wave pressure distribution at each measuring point see fig 7 of the floating breakwater under different wave steepness with the fixed mooring angle 30 27 in which no 1 no 6 denote the waveward measuring points no 9 no 14 denote the leeward measuring points while no 7 and no 8 denote the measuring points at the vertical plate clearly the water pressure increases with increasing wave steepness the maxima of the water pressure appear at the waveward side which is near the still water surface with the increase of the submerged water depth the pressure decreases accordingly the pressures on the waveward side and the leeward side are generally consistent pressures on the outside of the floating structure are significantly larger than those of inside meanwhile the positive pressure peak is greater than the negative pressure peak at the corner between the floating box and the vertical plate due to the turbulent effect of the water wave the pressure changes sharply leading to a snap value and the distribution regularity is not obvious compared with other places similar to the tension of mooring line water pressure on the floating body is also affected by wave condition and anchor condition for analyzing the water pressure sensitivity of the floating body structure fig 20 present the variation of water pressure with relative width w l for selected measuring points op2 op8 ip2 and ip8 see fig 7 under the mooring angle 30 27 likewise nondimensionalized parameters of the relative width w l and the wave steepness h l are adopted it is found that the water pressure loads on the floating box and vertical plate decreases with relative width w l increasing basically which is quite similar with features of the floating body motion and mooring line tension fig 21 selectively presents the pressure variation of floating body on points op2 op8 and op13 for different mooring angles it is obvious that the water pressure increases with decreasing mooring angle and the discrepancy between 60 55 and 30 27 appears a growing tendency with wave period according to the above analyses the relationship between water pressures on the floating body with the mooring angle is basically the similar with that of the mooring line tension which fully reflects a good consistency of dynamic performance for the floating breakwater 4 conclusions in this study a series of two dimensional wave flume model tests with scale of 1 25 have been carried out to get insights into the dynamic response mechanisms quantitatively for a water ballast type floating breakwater the motion and water pressure of the floating body tensions of the mooring lines have been systemically examined with aspect to different parameters including the structural parameters and wave conditions etc the natural dynamic characteristics of the moored floating system have been studied by a free decay experiment a tension amplitude ratio and its phase difference have also been defined to analyze the fairlead tensions between different mooing lines for both waveward leeward and upper lower side of the floating body furthermore the external and inner water pressure and its distribution on the floating box and vertical plate have been presented the following conclusions can be drawn the sway and roll of the floating body present strongly nonlinearity due to water on deck and sloshing occurrence the sway increases with the wave period while the mean value is not affected significantly by the wave period the roll increases first and then maintain stable as wave period increases the heave maintains a downward mean position drifting from the free surface due to the mean drift force wave period has a significant effect to the mean heave value and the peak value occurs at its natural period which warns a risk for the floating body grounding during use period it also impacts the erosion and deposition of the seabed in the long term four rows of mooring lines were used to connect the floating body which leads to the mechanical mechanism of the mooring line becoming increasingly complicated at both waveward and leeward side of the breakwater the mooring lines give almost comparable amount but opposite phase of tension in terms of both upper and lower all the upper tensions are larger than those of lower side but the response frequency is almost equivalent the upper mooring lines tension decrease and tend to be stable with increasing wave period while the lower tension increases and tend to be stable with increasing wave period which has close relationships to the roll of the floating body this is another indication of how important the used anti rolling tank of the water ballast type breakwater is similar to the floating body motion and tension of the mooring line the water pressure reveals strongly nonlinear characteristics which is due to wave breaking and the sloshing occurrence the water pressures on the outside of the floating structure are significantly larger than those of inside the maxima appear at the waveward side which is near the still water surface owing to the turbulence at the corner between the floating box and the vertical plate the pressure changes sharply leading to a snap value in general the mooring line tension and water pressure of the floating body decrease with increasing relative width w l and mooring angle θ but increase with increasing wave steepness h l which fully reflects a good consistency of dynamic performance for the floating breakwater the present results in this study demonstrate that the water ballast tank can effectively improve the dynamic performance for a floating breakwater which provide a database for its detailed designing in terms of structural and material selection in future on going work is considering the irregular wave model tests and numerical simulations of a multiple moored water ballast type floating structures credit authorship contribution statement
