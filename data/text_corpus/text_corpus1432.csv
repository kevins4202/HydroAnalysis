7160,we present artificial neural network ann based software for rapidly predicting the recovery effectiveness ren of aquifer storage and recovery asr wells in fresh water aquifers the ren performance criterion equals the amount of the water injected in an asr well that is recoverable via the same well during a specified extraction period the software circumvents the need to prepare and run computationally intensive simulations by invoking ann models as surrogate simulators the paper presents the development of the ann models and a graphical user interface gui to facilitate using the ann models and to perform sensitivity analysis ann inputs include all factors significantly affecting ren in freshwater aquifers the software can evaluate ren in any asr system in confined aquifers whose parameters are within the range of parameters used for training the anns in this study keywords aquifer storage and recovery recovery effectiveness neural networks sensitivity analysis decision support systems 1 introduction aquifer storage and recovery asr is the recharge of excess surface water into an aquifer for later withdrawal an asr system provides an alternative to storage in surface reservoirs without many of the environmental concerns evaporation losses and costs pyne 1995 brown 2005 most asr studies reported in literature address saline aquifers ward et al 2009 barker et al 2016 brown et al 2016 recovery efficiency here termed resaline is commonly used to quantify the performance of the asr wells in saline aquifers eq 1 1 re saline v e v i where v e is the volume of extracted water with acceptable quality for intended use and v i is the volume of the injected water resaline is measurable in the field during asr operation the availability of the field data allows simulation model calibration and subsequent computation of resaline pavelic et al 2006 significant density difference between injected water and ambient or native groundwater requires using variable density coupled flow and transport models ward et al 2009 water managers can also implement asr systems in freshwater aquifers forghani and peralta 2017a lowry and anderson 2006 the jordan valley water conservancy district jvwcd began an asr project in utah usa in the year 2000 an objective in developing this asr system is to receive additional water rights for extraction during dry months by injecting excess surface water during wet months when granting multiple year carryover credit for injectate to the jvwcd the utah division of water rights udwr which determines water rights for the region included the condition that 10 of the injected volume is lost for each year of carryover storage after the first 12 months from injection this 10 is intended to address the lateral velocity of the stored injectate and the likely losses of that water from jvwcd s ability to recover it through pumping the asr wells personal communication with eric jones udwr in response to a jvwcd suggestion and as an alternative to long term tracer testing we present a counting molecules method to estimate a jvwcd asr wells recovery effectiveness ren forghani and peralta 2017b eq 2 shows that the ren performance criterion is the proportion of the injected water that the same asr well can recover 2 ren v e v e inj v i where v e inj is the volume of injected water injectate available in the total extracted water ve and v i is the total volume of injectate note that ren is a function of total extracted water ve eq 3 shows the relation between ren and re in saline aquifers 3 re saline ren v e v e amb v i where v e amb is the volume of ambient groundwater present in the extracted water pyne 1995 pp 103 shows how to quantify ren in asr systems in saline aquifers although its value is not usually of interest for asr managers in saline aquifers on the other hand estimating ren in freshwater aquifers during long term field asr operations can be challenging because of the similar quality of injected water and native groundwater in field tracking techniques such as tracer tests can yield uncertain or inaccurate results especially for water right negotiations analytical equations addressing asr have simplifications that prevent accurate evaluation of some situations gelhar and collins 1971 developed an analytical equation to estimate concentration change during an injection extraction cycle at a fully penetrating well in a confined aquifer their relation however does not allow a period of injectate storage between injection and extraction preventing ren computation for that situation lu et al 2011 developed a numerical model to estimate performance of asr systems under various mass transfer parameters among the simplifications their study neglects background flow gradients one of the most important factors affecting asr systems therefore to reasonably estimate ren we use flow and transport simulation via modflow mcdonald and harbaugh 1988 and mt3dms zheng and wang 1999 however we recognize that developing modflow mt3dms models can be cumbersome and simulation times can be large impeding analysis and comparison of multiple asr scenarios within a short time asher et al 2015 to overcome this difficulty we present a software that rapidly estimates ren eq 2 in confined homogenous aquifers without the need to prepare and run modflow mt3dms models the software evaluates the possibility of achieving an acceptably high ren for any asr system that has similar asr settings as the settings assumed in developing the software for example for a given asr well the software can rapidly show how much extraction must occur to achieve an ren of 90 to recover 90 of the injectate the result allows water managers to evaluate the usefulness of a counting molecules method for asr systems management as a substitute for modflow mt3dms simulations the software invokes two trained ann models anns are powerful nonlinear regression techniques that can identify complex relations between input and output data many researchers have utilized anns in different fields including water resources hsu et al 1995 kralisch et al 2003 parkin et al 2007 adeloye 2009 maier et al 2010 izady et al 2013 several studies employ anns as surrogate groundwater simulators in optimization models to reduce computational burden aly and peralta 1999 coppola et al 2007 fayad et al 2012 peralta et al 2014 no published study however reports developing and using ann models to quantify the performance of asr wells also most anns reported in the literature are developed for a specific area or even a specific site within an area the presented generalized anns can also estimate ren for other asr systems having parameter values within the ranges used in developing the anns the dataset used to train and verify the anns derive from 10 000 modflow mt3dms simulations inputs independent variables for these simulations differ for seven hydrogeological and operational factors that potentially impact ren these factors are background gradient hydraulic conductivity injection rate and duration extraction rate and duration storage duration aquifer thickness porosity and longitudinal dispersivity to address the effect of storage duration on achievable ren we utilize two different sets of modflow mt3dms models for two different storage duration scenarios one set of modflow mt3dms simulations assumes no storage of injected water i e extraction starts immediately after injection the other set of simulations allows one year storage of injected water i e extraction begins after storing the injected water in the aquifer for 12 months each of the two sets involves 5000 modflow mt3dms simulations using random values of independent variables generated within reasonable ranges modflow mt3dms simulations outputs are the computed ren values for each 15 days of extraction up to 120 days to identify the significant independent variables for use in ann model development for each of the two storage duration scenarios we perform a correlation analysis using the relevant 5000 input output modflow mt3dms datasets analysis also reveals the relative importance of independent variables on ren then we use 5000 input output datasets to develop one ann for each storage duration scenario to handle the large number of modflow mt3dms simulations needed for this study we use parallel processing by the message passing interface mpi technique gropp et al 2014 mpi allows running a large number of simulations in parallel on a cluster of computing nodes the developed anns are alternatives to implementing modflow mt3dms simulations to estimate ren in confined freshwater aquifers using the developed anns one can easily investigate achievable ren for multiple hydrogeological settings or operational factors this significantly improves the capability to identify asr optimal locations and operational injection extraction factors 2 artificial neural network theory an ann serves as a universal approximator for complex functional relationships between input and output datasets ann calibration does not require a priori knowledge of the form of the relationship between inputs and outputs the input output datasets needed for training anns can be obtained from field or observation data or simulation model results bowden et al 2005 among many ann structures proposed and used since the 1950s three layer feedforward neural networks are the most popular hornik et al 1989 show that three layer feedforward anns can be trained to model any piecewise continuous function fig 1 shows an example of a three layer feedforward ann each layer consists of processing elements called neurons or nodes the first layer or input layer and the last layer or output layer consist of input and output data respectively the numbers of nodes in these layers are the same as the numbers of inputs and outputs to the ann model the middle layer is termed the hidden layer generally the number of nodes in the hidden layer is a design issue based upon problem complexity govindaraju 2000 usually neural networks contain some additional nodes called bias with values equal to one the bias nodes are analogous to the intercept in a linear regression model and can significantly improve ann flexibility the fig 1 ann structure is termed feedforward because information transfers only from a previous layer to the next layer all the nodes including bias from the previous layer connect to all the nodes of the next layer each connection has an associated weight that represents the connection importance the value of each node in the hidden layer is computed by applying an activation function usually a nonlinear function on the sum of the products of the values of input layer nodes and their associated weights eq 4 similarly the value of each node in output layer is computed by applying an activation function usually linear on the sum of the products of the values of the hidden layer nodes and their associated weights eq 5 eqs 4 and 5 show respectively the calculation of one hidden node h1 and one output node y1 in fig 1 by applying a logistic sigmoid function for the hidden layer and a linear activation function for the output layer 4 h 1 1 1 exp 1 w 01 x 1 w 11 x 2 w 21 5 y 1 1 w 01 h 1 w 11 h 2 w 21 h 3 w 31 training calibration of an ann model involves entering an input output dataset to the ann model and optimizing the network weights to minimize the sum of squared of model residuals residuals are the differences between observed outputs and the predicted outputs by ann model after assuming random values for all weights learning algorithms optimize the values of the weights among learning algorithms the back propagation algorithm rumelhart et al 1986 is the most popular for training feedforward anns as mentioned the number of nodes in the ann hidden layer strongly affects ann accuracy considering too few hidden nodes prevents adequate representation of model complexity considering too many hidden nodes results in overfitting that degrades the general applicability of an ann to explain overfitting note that any input output dataset contains both a pattern or signal and some random noises we want an ann to model only the pattern of the data that actually shows the relations between inputs and outputs using too many hidden nodes during training causes the ann to recognize the noise of the training dataset as well as its pattern because the noises are random and change in each dataset an overfitted ann model is a poor predictor when applied to other datasets one method to avoid overfitting is cross validation kuhn and johnson 2013 chp 4 subsequent sections present the cross validation used in this study in summary developing an ann model using a three layer feedforward structure involves 1 selecting appropriate activation functions for hidden and output layers 2 choosing an appropriate learning algorithm to optimize weights 3 determining the number of nodes in the hidden layer by cross validation and 4 optimizing and recording a set of weights as the main outcome of an ann development to use the developed ann for predicting new scenarios one can apply the weights in equations similar to eqs 4 and 5 to estimate the model response to new input data 3 methodology 3 1 selection of independent variables to prepare the ann models capable of predicting ren for desired hydrogeological or operational settings we need to consider all the factors that can impact ren herein we consider seven factors as potentially significant independent variables for ren estimation these factors are 1 background gradient 2 hydraulic conductivity 3 injection rate 4 extraction rate 5 aquifer thickness 6 porosity and 7 longitudinal dispersivity we select these factors based on previous asr studies merritt 1986 pyne 1995 lowry and anderson 2006 as well as preliminary modflow mt3dms simulations performed in this study the preliminary analyses show that for the same value of transmissivity which for a confined aquifer is calculated as the product of hydraulic conductivity k and aquifer thickness b different combinations of b and k provide different ren results this necessitates using k and b explicitly instead of using a transmissivity value as an independent variable also because preliminary analyses show that computed ren is insensitive to the value of specific storage for a confined aquifer we do not use the storativity value as an independent variable and assume a constant specific storage equals to 1e 6 1 m for all simulations 3 2 selection of ranges of independent variables table 1 shows the range of independent variables considered in this study the ranges of independent variables of scenarios 1 and 2 are identical except that scenario 2 has a smaller range for background hydraulic gradient modflow mt3dms simulations revealed that for scenario 2 storage duration of 1 year background gradients more than 0 004 produce negligible ren regardless of the values of other factors therefore the upper limit of the gradient for scenario 2 is 0 004 also of interest is the range selected for hydraulic conductivity k we use 70 m d 230 ft d as the conceptual upper limit of hydraulic conductivity for unconsolidated basinfill materials lambert 1995 pp 15 we initially assumed 7 m d as the lower limit of k to be one order of magnitude smaller than the assumed upper limit however preliminary modeling results showed that using a k value this low produces large head fluctuations at the well during asr simulation possibly resulting in a dry cell this might imply that it is not operationally appropriate to have an asr well in a fresh water aquifer with hydraulic conductivity this low so we increased the lower limit of k values to 13 m d 43 ft d each employed extraction rate equals the product of an injection rate and a selected extraction rate injection rate ratio because all considered jvwcd wells had a preexisting water right before conversion to asr operation we only use extraction rate to injection rate ratios equaling or exceeding 1 0 in value the assumed range of longitudinal dispersivity values is from 1 5 to 15 m the upper limit of 15 m results from using the maximum probable injectate plume length within the formula of xu and eckstein 1995 we assume horizontal and vertical transverse dispersivities one and two orders of magnitude smaller than longitudinal dispersivity respectively also we assume the effect of molecular diffusion is unimportant in this study 3 3 preparation of modflow mt3dms models we use modflow mt3dms simulations to prepare the input output dataset needed for training the ann models we construct two different modflow mt3dms models to address two storage duration scenarios for each scenario we implement 5000 modflow mt3dms simulations by randomly changing the seven independent variables within their table 1 ranges for both scenarios we model a fully penetrating asr well in a homogenous one layer confined aquifer we assume constant head boundaries on the eastern and western edges of the model and assume the asr well is at the center of the model area fig 2 we assume no flow boundary conditions on the northern and southern edges of the model the model domain is 10 000 m by 10 000 m the model has 1000 rows and 1000 columns of 10 m by 10 m cells we confirmed that the domain was sufficiently large to validly use constant head boundaries for tested pumping rates the validity of constant head conditions was tested using the results of some model runs imposing the highest possible effect on boundaries with the highest values of injection rate extraction rate hydraulic conductivity and aquifer thickness to reduce computation time in mt3dms we inactivated transport simulation in cells that are very far from the asr well using 10 m by 10 m cells provided acceptable ren accuracy the aquifer top elevation was always zero meters to simulate ren for a specified aquifer thickness we assigned a negative aquifer bottom elevation the background gradient is from the east to the west all western boundary cells had a 330 m constant head value in each simulation the eastern boundary heads had a uniform value selected from 330 to 480 m for scenario 1 to induce gradients of 0 0 to 0 015 and from 330 to 370 m for scenario 2 to induce gradients of 0 to 0 004 even the lowest 330 m constant head boundary ensured that the aquifer remained confined during simulations for all combinations of independent variables both scenarios 1 and 2 employ two months of uniform injection rates presumably during the period of high surface water flow and availability this is a representative asr system injection duration subsequently scenarios use four months of uniform extraction rates for scenario 1 models we use seven monthly stress periods each with two time steps the first stress period models the steady state conditions before asr operation to induce the desired background gradient injection occurs in periods 2 and 3 while extraction occurs in periods 4 to 7 for scenario 2 models we use 19 monthly stress periods each with two time steps again the first stress period represents the steady state conditions before asr operation to induce the desired background gradient also injection occurs in periods 2 and 3 no pumping occurs in periods 4 to 15 to allow storage of injected water for 12 months then extraction occurs for 4 months in periods 16 to 19 because both native groundwater and injected water are freshwaters of similar quality in mt3dms model we assume injected water has 100 ppm of imaginary non reactive solute to distinguish it from uncontaminated native groundwater mt3dms tracks the injected solute during asr operation and computes the amount of the injected solute that the same asr well recovers the estimated ren eq 2 equals the ratio of solute extracted by the asr well divided by the total injected solute we use both the advection and dispersion packages of the mt3dms simulating dispersion is essential to reasonably estimate mass recovery lowry and anderson 2006 we do not simulate reactions because both injected water and native groundwater are actually freshwaters of similar quality to minimize numerical dispersion we use the total variation diminishing tvd explicit finite difference technique the results of mt3dms simulations allow calculating cumulative ren at specified times during extraction here we record eight ren values after 15 30 45 60 75 90 105 and 120 days of extraction and call them ren 15d ren 30d and ren 120d respectively we use a c code to manage implementation of modflow mt3dms simulations the code initially generates 5000 sets of independent variables for each scenario the code generates the values of the seven inputs randomly with uniform distribution from their specified range shown in table 1 the code also systematically applies the inputs of modflow model i e constant head values in the eastern boundary injection rate ratio of extraction rate to injection rate aquifer thickness and hydraulic conductivity and the inputs of mt3dms model i e porosity longitudinal dispersivity and aquifer thickness then the c code runs modflow and then mt3dms codes and finally records the eight ren values ren 15d ren 30d ren 120d for each simulation 3 4 processing simulations in parallel the computational effort for running 10 000 modflow mt3dms simulations is large for some sets of input variables a single modflow mt3dms simulation takes more than one hour although for some others run time is a couple of minutes to reduce the calendar time needed for all simulations we use parallel processing on a cluster of computing nodes to run multiple simulations in parallel hunt et al 2010 parallel processing is especially beneficial in groundwater studies because of the usual large computational demands for groundwater simulations ketabchi and ataie ashtiani 2015 several studies parallelized modflow and mt3dms codes to improve the computational efficiency of each individual simulation arnett and greenwade 2000 ji et al 2014 dong and li 2009 also dong et al 2013 used a distributed parallel processing for monte carlo type stochastic modeling in groundwater systems liu et al 2013 and hunt et al 2010 presented two applications of cloud computing in groundwater studies in this study we use message passing interface mpi gropp et al 2014 neal et al 2010 which is one of the most popular parallel programming techniques to run modflow mt3dms simulations in parallel we use mpi to convert the serial c code mentioned in the previous section into a parallel code to implement mpi for example on a single personal computer pc we virtually define a number of computing processors independent of the number of the pc s cores to work simultaneously one of the processors works as a master and the rest work as slaves initially the master sends the inputs of a modflow mt3dms simulation to each slave each slave runs its assigned modflow mt3dms simulation and returns the computed ren values to the master upon receiving ren values from a slave the master sends a new set of simulation inputs to that slave this process continues until all simulations are complete one can run an mpi code on a pc or on a cluster of computing nodes running the mpi code on a cluster of computing nodes can significantly decrease the total run time because it enables employing more processors as slaves which actually allows running more simulations in parallel for this study we use the cluster of computing nodes of the center for high performance computing chpc at the university of utah to report the performance of parallel computing we use speedup index gropp et al 2014 pp 32 which is the ratio of the serial execution time ts to the parallel execution time tp 6 speedup t s t p 3 5 preparing anns running all 10 000 modflow mt3dms simulations and recording their ren results provides the input output dataset needed for training the ann models to train the ann models we use the neuralnet package fritsch and günther 2008 in the r platform r core team 2013 r is a free software that provides a fine environment for statistical computing and graphics as mentioned before we use three layer feedforward ann having one hidden layer we use the nonlinear sigmoid activation function and the linear activation function for the hidden layer and the output layer respectively as the learning algorithm within neuralnet we use the resilient back propagation with weight method riedmiller 1994 which has shown superior performance than the traditional back propagation technique before using the data for ann training we normalize the values of each independent variable using the maximum and minimum values of that independent variable eq 7 also instead of using ren values as a percentage value we use them as proportions ranging 0 1 7 normalized input value original value minimum value maximum value minimum value the number of nodes in the hidden layer is a design parameter we determine the number of hidden nodes using the cross validation technique to prevent overfitting we apply cross validation only on scenario 1 data and consider its result as the optimal number of hidden nodes for ann of scenario 2 as well to do cross validation we use repeated training testing splits or monte carlo cross validation kuhn and johnson 2013 pp 71 first we consider a set of values as the candidates for the number of hidden nodes for each candidate model with an assumed number of hidden nodes we randomly split the original dataset with 5000 data into training and testing subsets we use 80 of the data i e 4000 data for training and 20 of the data i e 1000 data for testing we train the candidate models with the training subset and then use the trained model to predict the outputs of the testing subset comparing the predicted outputs and observed outputs in the testing subset presents the performance of the trained model we repeat this process 20 times for each candidate model and compute the performances average for each candidate model if average performance of a candidate model becomes lower than performance of the models with less hidden nodes this shows the onset of overfitting in order to measure the performance of models on testing subsets we use root mean square error rmse as shown in eq 8 rmse has the same unit of the dependent variable herein ren and implies how far on average the residuals i e the difference between observed ren and predicted ren are from zero we also report the coefficient of determination r2 as shown in eq 9 8 rmse 1 n ren o ren p 2 9 r 2 1 ren o ren p 2 ren o ren o 2 in eqs 8 and 9 n is the number of data in the testing subset ren o are the observed values for ren ren p are the predicted values for ren and ren o is the mean of observed values for ren after finding the optimal number of hidden nodes using cross validation we develop the final ann models by training them using all 5000 data 4 results 4 1 parallel processing speedup during one access to chpc resources employing 20 eight core computing nodes in total 160 cores required 7 h and 43 min to run 5000 simulations of scenario 1 during another access using 20 twelve core computing nodes in total 240 cores required 6 h and 49 min to run 5000 simulations of scenario 2 the latter access provides 239 slave processors to run 239 simulations in parallel because scenario 2 simulations use more stress periods and time steps than scenario 1 simulations for the same independent parameter input values one scenario 2 simulation takes longer than one scenario 1 simulation parallel processing produced at least an 80 fold speedup for scenario 1 simulations by using 160 processing cores and at least 100 fold speedup for scenario 2 simulations by using 240 processing cores the speedup value of 100 is reasonable considering that the simulations are independent of each other and there is no interaction between slaves 4 2 data analysis and parameter selection for anns to initially identify the independent variables to use in the ann model for each scenario we performed correlation analysis on the respective 5000 input output datasets specifically we developed pearson correlation coefficients that show the relative importance of each of the seven independent variables in predicting ren table 2 here we use ren 90d as the representative value of ren ren is positively related to injection rate ratio of extraction to injection rate and effective porosity note that positive correlation of injection rate denotes for a given ratio of extraction to injection rate an increase in injection rate increases ren gradient hydraulic conductivity and aquifer thickness show a considerable negative correlation with ren the greater the gradient or the transmissivity the product of conductivity and aquifer thickness the greater the background seepage velocity the more quickly the injectate departs from the wells extraction zone and the less injectate is recoverable forghani and peralta 2017b fig 3 for instance shows the effect of background gradient on concentration of the imaginary solute i e injectate in a typical asr well with a one year storage duration scenario 2 as mentioned before if gradient exceeds 0 04 all injectate departs the well s capture zone even before the extraction period begins zero concentration during extraction period so no injectate can be recovered zero ren on the other hand if gradient is negligible i e seepage velocity is negligible concentration reduction during the storage duration is negligible concentration of the imaginary solute decreases only during the extraction era therefore water recovered during the extraction era has a high concentration resulting in a high ren in both scenarios the strongest correlations are for gradient and hydraulic conductivity therefore these two are the most important variables on ren the importance of gradient even increases fig 3 by allowing one year storage of the injected water in scenario 2 the weakest correlation is for longitudinal dispersivity especially for scenario 2 because the correlation coefficient of longitudinal dispersivity is negligible for scenario 2 i e equal to 0 01 we consider that as an insignificant independent variable and therefore we do not use it for making the ann model for scenario 2 however we use longitudinal dispersivity as an input to make ann for scenario 1 note that because the inputs are randomly created values there is no correlation between them and the correlation coefficients are less than 0 02 for any pair of independent variables in summary we use all seven independent variables in table 1 as inputs to develop the scenario 1 ann but exclude longitudinal dispersivity for making the scenario 2 ann note that we did not omit longitudinal dispersivity from transport models we only do not use them in making the ann model for scenario 2 4 3 ann for scenario 1 the ann for scenario 1 has seven nodes in the input layer and eight nodes in the output layer the inputs are all seven independent variables shown in table 1 and the outputs are eight values of ren 15d to ren 120d to determine the optimal number of hidden nodes we use cross validation by considering 3 5 8 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 and 50 as the candidate numbers of hidden nodes fig 4 shows the results of cross validation fig 4 shows the mean of rmse and r2 for 20 random resamplings used for each candidate model the figure also shows the 95 confidence interval for rmse mean values of each candidate model the numerically optimal value for the number of hidden nodes is 30 because it provides the least rmse and highest r2 using more than 30 hidden nodes cause rmse to increase or fluctuate which is a sign of overfitting therefore we consider 30 as the final result of cross validation if needing to have a more parsimonious ann model one could use 15 25 hidden nodes since rmse and r2 do not improve significantly after these numbers nevertheless we choose 30 as the optimal number of ann hidden nodes in this study for a representative testing training data partition fig 5 shows the performance of the ann with 30 hidden nodes on a testing subset with 1000 data shown with blue squares after being trained with the associated training subset for example the rmse of ann predicted ren versus modflow mt3dms simulated ren at 90 days of extraction is 5 42 in fact fig 5 shows the power of the developed ann model for use as a predictive model for the same training and testing datasets used for fig 5 fig 6 shows that at 90 days of extraction most individual ann predicted rens are within 5 of modflow mt3dms simulated values and residuals are randomly scattered about zero after confirming the predictability of the ann model with 30 hidden nodes using training testing subsets we develop the final ann model by training an ann with 30 hidden nodes using all 5000 data in scenario 1 4 4 ann for scenario 2 the ann for scenario 2 has six nodes in the input layer and eight nodes in the output layer the inputs are the independent variables shown in table 1 except longitudinal dispersivity which insignificantly affects ren for scenario 2 the outputs are eight values of ren 15d to ren 120d for consistency we use the same number of hidden nodes determined for scenario 1 ann equal to 30 for the ann model of scenario 2 fig 7 shows the prediction ability of the scenario 2 ann model on a testing subset eventually to develop the final scenario 2 ann model we train an ann with 30 hidden nodes using all 5000 data in scenario 2 because the accuracy of the developed anns for predicting ren is quite suitable we did not examine alternative activation functions more advanced neural networks or other machine learning techniques e g support vector machines 4 5 application of ann models providing the asr system s hydrogeological and operational settings are within the range of parameters used to develop the ann models the developed anns can serve as reconnaissance tools for immediate ren estimation without having to prepare and run modflow mt3dms simulations this is important because a single modflow mt3dms simulation can take more than one hour the rapid estimation ability of anns encourages their inclusion within decision support systems dss jakeman et al 2011 a dss should respond to what if questions rapidly anderson et al 2015 pp 526 using modflow mt3dms models in dss systems is not as attractive because of their usual long runtimes this section demonstrates using the presented anns to analyze ren sensitivity to values of independent variables assuming one year storage of injected water i e scenario 2 and an asr well screened in one confined layer we first evaluate ren sensitivity to background gradient values for the following representative jvwcd asr well conditions aquifer thickness 61 m hydraulic conductivity 39 5 m d effective porosity 0 3 injection rate 5000 m3 day extraction rate 10 000 m3 day ratio of extraction to injection rate 2 because longitudinal dispersivity is not significant in scenario 2 the computed ren results are insensitive to changes in dispersivity fig 8 shows the changes in ren 90d for 50 gradient values selected in its specified range i e 0 0 004 note that plotting the results from running 50 modflow mt3dms simulations using 50 different gradients would produce a similar plot this figure aids identifying optimal locations for a proposed asr well for example assuming other factors remain unchanged installing the asr well in a region with background gradient less than 0 0007 could provide a 100 ren 90d ren 90d i e ren after extracting for 90 days would decline significantly for gradients exceeding 0 0007 fig 8 demonstrates that the developed ann models have captured the nonlinear relation between ren and background gradient the anns can provide similar insight into ren sensitivity to other independent variables assuming one would install the well in a location having a 0 0015 background gradient the predicted achievable ren 90d is 63 fig 8 to try to improve ren for that location one can use the ann models to investigate a change in operational factors of injection and extraction rates fig 9 shows the mutual impacts of injection and extraction rates on ren 90d for this well the figure results from numerous ann simulations by changing the values of injection rates and ratio of extraction to injection rates e i in their specified range while keeping other independent variables constant i e 39 5 m d hydraulic conductivity 0 0015 gradient 61 m aquifer thickness and 0 3 effective porosity fig 9 shows that achieving a ren 90d i e ren after extracting for 90 days exceeding 90 after one year storage requires an injection rate exceeding 7000 m3 d and an e i exceeding 2 5 i e extraction rate must exceed 17 500 m3 d an injection rate of 7000 m3 d for two months provides 420 000 m3 of injectate and an extraction rate of 17 500 m3 d for 90 days yields 1 575 000 m3 recovered water therefore for recovering 90 of the injected water achieving ren of 90 by extracting for 90 days the total extraction volume must be 3 75 times the total injection volume for this situation one infers that achieving a high ren requires that the injecting organization would already have the right to extract 2 75 times the volume that it plans to inject the jvwcd has pre existing groundwater pumping rights and uses asr to increase their total legal groundwater pumping other organizations subject to the same conditions would require pre existing or new groundwater pumping rights to achieve high ren values in the absence of pre existing groundwater right however results such as fig 9 imply that using ren as the criterion for gaining credit for the recharged water will result in groundwater depletion because much higher extraction than injection is needed for a satisfactory ren regardless of whether or how ren is used as a criterion for gaining credit for aquifer recharge via asr the developed anns provide rapid estimation of injectate recovery plots such as fig 9 can help water managers evaluate the usefulness of a counting molecules procedure using ren index for managing asr systems 4 6 application for partially penetrating wells or wells screened in multiple layers development of the anns assumed fully penetrating wells screened in one layer systems however the anns also reasonably estimate ren for partially penetrating wells or for wells screened in multiple aquifer layers that have different horizontal hydraulic conductivities if negligible vertical flow occurs between screen intervals this condition occurs if geologic material between the screens has low vertical hydraulic conductivity or if confining units exists between aquifer layers in such a situation injectates in different screen intervals act relatively independent of each other and separate screen intervals act similarly to fully penetrating wells pavelic et al 2006 ward et al 2008 also each screen interval receives a proportion of total injected water based on its transmissivity t i with respect to the sum of all interval transmissivities t i therefore by inputting a screen interval length instead of total aquifer thickness and the rate of injection into the interval the user can employ the anns to compute the ren for each individual screen interval ren i finally the ren for the entire asr well equals 10 ren well ren i t i t i forghani and peralta 2017c used the developed anns with eq 10 as the surrogate ren simulator within a coupled simulation optimization model developed for the jvwcd asr system to verify the accuracy of the surrogate simulator for multi layer asr wells they compared ren simulator results with the results from coupled regional 7 layer modflow and mt3dms models for accuracy the regional transport model uses the mnw2 package konikow et al 2009 and field values of installed asr well screen intervals for one of the optimal strategies obtained in forghani and peralta 2017c fig 10 compares the rens computed from the anns with the rens computed from the transport model this figure shows the acceptable accuracy of using the anns and eq 10 for estimating ren for multi layer wells 4 7 software development the software presented here includes a stand alone executable containing the ann models modflow and mt3dms executables to allow testing new situations and a graphical user interface gui to facilitate using the executables the final ann models for scenarios 1 and 2 contain a set of optimized weights as shown in fig 1 the anns executable uses these weights in equations similar to eqs 4 and 5 to compute ren for user specified inputs the gui and the ann executable allow analyzing the sensitivity of ren to changes in one or two independent variables e g figs 8 and 9 respectively assuming other independent variable values remain constant fig 11 shows a screenshot of the software as used to develop fig 9 the gui can also compare the results of the ann models with the results of actual transport modeling by invoking modflow mt3dms models developed for fig 2 for selected strategies these strategies are usually selected after conducting sensitivity analysis with ann models the developed software is available from peralta web bluezone usu edu 5 conclusions recovery effectiveness ren is the proportion of the injected water that the same asr well can recover the study presents development of software for rapidly estimating ren in fresh water homogeneous aquifers the software development involves training distinct ann models to estimate ren for two scenarios without and with storage of injected water we trained and tested the ann models using input and output data from numerous modflow mt3dms simulations for considered scenarios sensitivity analyses show that gradient and hydraulic conductivity most significantly impact ren and dispersivity has little impact especially for the scenario allowing one year of injectate storage before beginning extraction the developed software is a reconnaissance tool for immediate ren estimation for the ranges of hydrogeological and operational settings used in developing the ann models using the reported software avoids the need to prepare and run modflow mt3dms simulations for situations lying within tested ranges of operational and hydrogeological parameters for the considered scenarios the software allows water managers to evaluate the usefulness of a counting molecules method in managing asr systems plots such as fig 9 developed for an asr well aid investigating the possibility of achieving a satisfactory ren without

7160,we present artificial neural network ann based software for rapidly predicting the recovery effectiveness ren of aquifer storage and recovery asr wells in fresh water aquifers the ren performance criterion equals the amount of the water injected in an asr well that is recoverable via the same well during a specified extraction period the software circumvents the need to prepare and run computationally intensive simulations by invoking ann models as surrogate simulators the paper presents the development of the ann models and a graphical user interface gui to facilitate using the ann models and to perform sensitivity analysis ann inputs include all factors significantly affecting ren in freshwater aquifers the software can evaluate ren in any asr system in confined aquifers whose parameters are within the range of parameters used for training the anns in this study keywords aquifer storage and recovery recovery effectiveness neural networks sensitivity analysis decision support systems 1 introduction aquifer storage and recovery asr is the recharge of excess surface water into an aquifer for later withdrawal an asr system provides an alternative to storage in surface reservoirs without many of the environmental concerns evaporation losses and costs pyne 1995 brown 2005 most asr studies reported in literature address saline aquifers ward et al 2009 barker et al 2016 brown et al 2016 recovery efficiency here termed resaline is commonly used to quantify the performance of the asr wells in saline aquifers eq 1 1 re saline v e v i where v e is the volume of extracted water with acceptable quality for intended use and v i is the volume of the injected water resaline is measurable in the field during asr operation the availability of the field data allows simulation model calibration and subsequent computation of resaline pavelic et al 2006 significant density difference between injected water and ambient or native groundwater requires using variable density coupled flow and transport models ward et al 2009 water managers can also implement asr systems in freshwater aquifers forghani and peralta 2017a lowry and anderson 2006 the jordan valley water conservancy district jvwcd began an asr project in utah usa in the year 2000 an objective in developing this asr system is to receive additional water rights for extraction during dry months by injecting excess surface water during wet months when granting multiple year carryover credit for injectate to the jvwcd the utah division of water rights udwr which determines water rights for the region included the condition that 10 of the injected volume is lost for each year of carryover storage after the first 12 months from injection this 10 is intended to address the lateral velocity of the stored injectate and the likely losses of that water from jvwcd s ability to recover it through pumping the asr wells personal communication with eric jones udwr in response to a jvwcd suggestion and as an alternative to long term tracer testing we present a counting molecules method to estimate a jvwcd asr wells recovery effectiveness ren forghani and peralta 2017b eq 2 shows that the ren performance criterion is the proportion of the injected water that the same asr well can recover 2 ren v e v e inj v i where v e inj is the volume of injected water injectate available in the total extracted water ve and v i is the total volume of injectate note that ren is a function of total extracted water ve eq 3 shows the relation between ren and re in saline aquifers 3 re saline ren v e v e amb v i where v e amb is the volume of ambient groundwater present in the extracted water pyne 1995 pp 103 shows how to quantify ren in asr systems in saline aquifers although its value is not usually of interest for asr managers in saline aquifers on the other hand estimating ren in freshwater aquifers during long term field asr operations can be challenging because of the similar quality of injected water and native groundwater in field tracking techniques such as tracer tests can yield uncertain or inaccurate results especially for water right negotiations analytical equations addressing asr have simplifications that prevent accurate evaluation of some situations gelhar and collins 1971 developed an analytical equation to estimate concentration change during an injection extraction cycle at a fully penetrating well in a confined aquifer their relation however does not allow a period of injectate storage between injection and extraction preventing ren computation for that situation lu et al 2011 developed a numerical model to estimate performance of asr systems under various mass transfer parameters among the simplifications their study neglects background flow gradients one of the most important factors affecting asr systems therefore to reasonably estimate ren we use flow and transport simulation via modflow mcdonald and harbaugh 1988 and mt3dms zheng and wang 1999 however we recognize that developing modflow mt3dms models can be cumbersome and simulation times can be large impeding analysis and comparison of multiple asr scenarios within a short time asher et al 2015 to overcome this difficulty we present a software that rapidly estimates ren eq 2 in confined homogenous aquifers without the need to prepare and run modflow mt3dms models the software evaluates the possibility of achieving an acceptably high ren for any asr system that has similar asr settings as the settings assumed in developing the software for example for a given asr well the software can rapidly show how much extraction must occur to achieve an ren of 90 to recover 90 of the injectate the result allows water managers to evaluate the usefulness of a counting molecules method for asr systems management as a substitute for modflow mt3dms simulations the software invokes two trained ann models anns are powerful nonlinear regression techniques that can identify complex relations between input and output data many researchers have utilized anns in different fields including water resources hsu et al 1995 kralisch et al 2003 parkin et al 2007 adeloye 2009 maier et al 2010 izady et al 2013 several studies employ anns as surrogate groundwater simulators in optimization models to reduce computational burden aly and peralta 1999 coppola et al 2007 fayad et al 2012 peralta et al 2014 no published study however reports developing and using ann models to quantify the performance of asr wells also most anns reported in the literature are developed for a specific area or even a specific site within an area the presented generalized anns can also estimate ren for other asr systems having parameter values within the ranges used in developing the anns the dataset used to train and verify the anns derive from 10 000 modflow mt3dms simulations inputs independent variables for these simulations differ for seven hydrogeological and operational factors that potentially impact ren these factors are background gradient hydraulic conductivity injection rate and duration extraction rate and duration storage duration aquifer thickness porosity and longitudinal dispersivity to address the effect of storage duration on achievable ren we utilize two different sets of modflow mt3dms models for two different storage duration scenarios one set of modflow mt3dms simulations assumes no storage of injected water i e extraction starts immediately after injection the other set of simulations allows one year storage of injected water i e extraction begins after storing the injected water in the aquifer for 12 months each of the two sets involves 5000 modflow mt3dms simulations using random values of independent variables generated within reasonable ranges modflow mt3dms simulations outputs are the computed ren values for each 15 days of extraction up to 120 days to identify the significant independent variables for use in ann model development for each of the two storage duration scenarios we perform a correlation analysis using the relevant 5000 input output modflow mt3dms datasets analysis also reveals the relative importance of independent variables on ren then we use 5000 input output datasets to develop one ann for each storage duration scenario to handle the large number of modflow mt3dms simulations needed for this study we use parallel processing by the message passing interface mpi technique gropp et al 2014 mpi allows running a large number of simulations in parallel on a cluster of computing nodes the developed anns are alternatives to implementing modflow mt3dms simulations to estimate ren in confined freshwater aquifers using the developed anns one can easily investigate achievable ren for multiple hydrogeological settings or operational factors this significantly improves the capability to identify asr optimal locations and operational injection extraction factors 2 artificial neural network theory an ann serves as a universal approximator for complex functional relationships between input and output datasets ann calibration does not require a priori knowledge of the form of the relationship between inputs and outputs the input output datasets needed for training anns can be obtained from field or observation data or simulation model results bowden et al 2005 among many ann structures proposed and used since the 1950s three layer feedforward neural networks are the most popular hornik et al 1989 show that three layer feedforward anns can be trained to model any piecewise continuous function fig 1 shows an example of a three layer feedforward ann each layer consists of processing elements called neurons or nodes the first layer or input layer and the last layer or output layer consist of input and output data respectively the numbers of nodes in these layers are the same as the numbers of inputs and outputs to the ann model the middle layer is termed the hidden layer generally the number of nodes in the hidden layer is a design issue based upon problem complexity govindaraju 2000 usually neural networks contain some additional nodes called bias with values equal to one the bias nodes are analogous to the intercept in a linear regression model and can significantly improve ann flexibility the fig 1 ann structure is termed feedforward because information transfers only from a previous layer to the next layer all the nodes including bias from the previous layer connect to all the nodes of the next layer each connection has an associated weight that represents the connection importance the value of each node in the hidden layer is computed by applying an activation function usually a nonlinear function on the sum of the products of the values of input layer nodes and their associated weights eq 4 similarly the value of each node in output layer is computed by applying an activation function usually linear on the sum of the products of the values of the hidden layer nodes and their associated weights eq 5 eqs 4 and 5 show respectively the calculation of one hidden node h1 and one output node y1 in fig 1 by applying a logistic sigmoid function for the hidden layer and a linear activation function for the output layer 4 h 1 1 1 exp 1 w 01 x 1 w 11 x 2 w 21 5 y 1 1 w 01 h 1 w 11 h 2 w 21 h 3 w 31 training calibration of an ann model involves entering an input output dataset to the ann model and optimizing the network weights to minimize the sum of squared of model residuals residuals are the differences between observed outputs and the predicted outputs by ann model after assuming random values for all weights learning algorithms optimize the values of the weights among learning algorithms the back propagation algorithm rumelhart et al 1986 is the most popular for training feedforward anns as mentioned the number of nodes in the ann hidden layer strongly affects ann accuracy considering too few hidden nodes prevents adequate representation of model complexity considering too many hidden nodes results in overfitting that degrades the general applicability of an ann to explain overfitting note that any input output dataset contains both a pattern or signal and some random noises we want an ann to model only the pattern of the data that actually shows the relations between inputs and outputs using too many hidden nodes during training causes the ann to recognize the noise of the training dataset as well as its pattern because the noises are random and change in each dataset an overfitted ann model is a poor predictor when applied to other datasets one method to avoid overfitting is cross validation kuhn and johnson 2013 chp 4 subsequent sections present the cross validation used in this study in summary developing an ann model using a three layer feedforward structure involves 1 selecting appropriate activation functions for hidden and output layers 2 choosing an appropriate learning algorithm to optimize weights 3 determining the number of nodes in the hidden layer by cross validation and 4 optimizing and recording a set of weights as the main outcome of an ann development to use the developed ann for predicting new scenarios one can apply the weights in equations similar to eqs 4 and 5 to estimate the model response to new input data 3 methodology 3 1 selection of independent variables to prepare the ann models capable of predicting ren for desired hydrogeological or operational settings we need to consider all the factors that can impact ren herein we consider seven factors as potentially significant independent variables for ren estimation these factors are 1 background gradient 2 hydraulic conductivity 3 injection rate 4 extraction rate 5 aquifer thickness 6 porosity and 7 longitudinal dispersivity we select these factors based on previous asr studies merritt 1986 pyne 1995 lowry and anderson 2006 as well as preliminary modflow mt3dms simulations performed in this study the preliminary analyses show that for the same value of transmissivity which for a confined aquifer is calculated as the product of hydraulic conductivity k and aquifer thickness b different combinations of b and k provide different ren results this necessitates using k and b explicitly instead of using a transmissivity value as an independent variable also because preliminary analyses show that computed ren is insensitive to the value of specific storage for a confined aquifer we do not use the storativity value as an independent variable and assume a constant specific storage equals to 1e 6 1 m for all simulations 3 2 selection of ranges of independent variables table 1 shows the range of independent variables considered in this study the ranges of independent variables of scenarios 1 and 2 are identical except that scenario 2 has a smaller range for background hydraulic gradient modflow mt3dms simulations revealed that for scenario 2 storage duration of 1 year background gradients more than 0 004 produce negligible ren regardless of the values of other factors therefore the upper limit of the gradient for scenario 2 is 0 004 also of interest is the range selected for hydraulic conductivity k we use 70 m d 230 ft d as the conceptual upper limit of hydraulic conductivity for unconsolidated basinfill materials lambert 1995 pp 15 we initially assumed 7 m d as the lower limit of k to be one order of magnitude smaller than the assumed upper limit however preliminary modeling results showed that using a k value this low produces large head fluctuations at the well during asr simulation possibly resulting in a dry cell this might imply that it is not operationally appropriate to have an asr well in a fresh water aquifer with hydraulic conductivity this low so we increased the lower limit of k values to 13 m d 43 ft d each employed extraction rate equals the product of an injection rate and a selected extraction rate injection rate ratio because all considered jvwcd wells had a preexisting water right before conversion to asr operation we only use extraction rate to injection rate ratios equaling or exceeding 1 0 in value the assumed range of longitudinal dispersivity values is from 1 5 to 15 m the upper limit of 15 m results from using the maximum probable injectate plume length within the formula of xu and eckstein 1995 we assume horizontal and vertical transverse dispersivities one and two orders of magnitude smaller than longitudinal dispersivity respectively also we assume the effect of molecular diffusion is unimportant in this study 3 3 preparation of modflow mt3dms models we use modflow mt3dms simulations to prepare the input output dataset needed for training the ann models we construct two different modflow mt3dms models to address two storage duration scenarios for each scenario we implement 5000 modflow mt3dms simulations by randomly changing the seven independent variables within their table 1 ranges for both scenarios we model a fully penetrating asr well in a homogenous one layer confined aquifer we assume constant head boundaries on the eastern and western edges of the model and assume the asr well is at the center of the model area fig 2 we assume no flow boundary conditions on the northern and southern edges of the model the model domain is 10 000 m by 10 000 m the model has 1000 rows and 1000 columns of 10 m by 10 m cells we confirmed that the domain was sufficiently large to validly use constant head boundaries for tested pumping rates the validity of constant head conditions was tested using the results of some model runs imposing the highest possible effect on boundaries with the highest values of injection rate extraction rate hydraulic conductivity and aquifer thickness to reduce computation time in mt3dms we inactivated transport simulation in cells that are very far from the asr well using 10 m by 10 m cells provided acceptable ren accuracy the aquifer top elevation was always zero meters to simulate ren for a specified aquifer thickness we assigned a negative aquifer bottom elevation the background gradient is from the east to the west all western boundary cells had a 330 m constant head value in each simulation the eastern boundary heads had a uniform value selected from 330 to 480 m for scenario 1 to induce gradients of 0 0 to 0 015 and from 330 to 370 m for scenario 2 to induce gradients of 0 to 0 004 even the lowest 330 m constant head boundary ensured that the aquifer remained confined during simulations for all combinations of independent variables both scenarios 1 and 2 employ two months of uniform injection rates presumably during the period of high surface water flow and availability this is a representative asr system injection duration subsequently scenarios use four months of uniform extraction rates for scenario 1 models we use seven monthly stress periods each with two time steps the first stress period models the steady state conditions before asr operation to induce the desired background gradient injection occurs in periods 2 and 3 while extraction occurs in periods 4 to 7 for scenario 2 models we use 19 monthly stress periods each with two time steps again the first stress period represents the steady state conditions before asr operation to induce the desired background gradient also injection occurs in periods 2 and 3 no pumping occurs in periods 4 to 15 to allow storage of injected water for 12 months then extraction occurs for 4 months in periods 16 to 19 because both native groundwater and injected water are freshwaters of similar quality in mt3dms model we assume injected water has 100 ppm of imaginary non reactive solute to distinguish it from uncontaminated native groundwater mt3dms tracks the injected solute during asr operation and computes the amount of the injected solute that the same asr well recovers the estimated ren eq 2 equals the ratio of solute extracted by the asr well divided by the total injected solute we use both the advection and dispersion packages of the mt3dms simulating dispersion is essential to reasonably estimate mass recovery lowry and anderson 2006 we do not simulate reactions because both injected water and native groundwater are actually freshwaters of similar quality to minimize numerical dispersion we use the total variation diminishing tvd explicit finite difference technique the results of mt3dms simulations allow calculating cumulative ren at specified times during extraction here we record eight ren values after 15 30 45 60 75 90 105 and 120 days of extraction and call them ren 15d ren 30d and ren 120d respectively we use a c code to manage implementation of modflow mt3dms simulations the code initially generates 5000 sets of independent variables for each scenario the code generates the values of the seven inputs randomly with uniform distribution from their specified range shown in table 1 the code also systematically applies the inputs of modflow model i e constant head values in the eastern boundary injection rate ratio of extraction rate to injection rate aquifer thickness and hydraulic conductivity and the inputs of mt3dms model i e porosity longitudinal dispersivity and aquifer thickness then the c code runs modflow and then mt3dms codes and finally records the eight ren values ren 15d ren 30d ren 120d for each simulation 3 4 processing simulations in parallel the computational effort for running 10 000 modflow mt3dms simulations is large for some sets of input variables a single modflow mt3dms simulation takes more than one hour although for some others run time is a couple of minutes to reduce the calendar time needed for all simulations we use parallel processing on a cluster of computing nodes to run multiple simulations in parallel hunt et al 2010 parallel processing is especially beneficial in groundwater studies because of the usual large computational demands for groundwater simulations ketabchi and ataie ashtiani 2015 several studies parallelized modflow and mt3dms codes to improve the computational efficiency of each individual simulation arnett and greenwade 2000 ji et al 2014 dong and li 2009 also dong et al 2013 used a distributed parallel processing for monte carlo type stochastic modeling in groundwater systems liu et al 2013 and hunt et al 2010 presented two applications of cloud computing in groundwater studies in this study we use message passing interface mpi gropp et al 2014 neal et al 2010 which is one of the most popular parallel programming techniques to run modflow mt3dms simulations in parallel we use mpi to convert the serial c code mentioned in the previous section into a parallel code to implement mpi for example on a single personal computer pc we virtually define a number of computing processors independent of the number of the pc s cores to work simultaneously one of the processors works as a master and the rest work as slaves initially the master sends the inputs of a modflow mt3dms simulation to each slave each slave runs its assigned modflow mt3dms simulation and returns the computed ren values to the master upon receiving ren values from a slave the master sends a new set of simulation inputs to that slave this process continues until all simulations are complete one can run an mpi code on a pc or on a cluster of computing nodes running the mpi code on a cluster of computing nodes can significantly decrease the total run time because it enables employing more processors as slaves which actually allows running more simulations in parallel for this study we use the cluster of computing nodes of the center for high performance computing chpc at the university of utah to report the performance of parallel computing we use speedup index gropp et al 2014 pp 32 which is the ratio of the serial execution time ts to the parallel execution time tp 6 speedup t s t p 3 5 preparing anns running all 10 000 modflow mt3dms simulations and recording their ren results provides the input output dataset needed for training the ann models to train the ann models we use the neuralnet package fritsch and günther 2008 in the r platform r core team 2013 r is a free software that provides a fine environment for statistical computing and graphics as mentioned before we use three layer feedforward ann having one hidden layer we use the nonlinear sigmoid activation function and the linear activation function for the hidden layer and the output layer respectively as the learning algorithm within neuralnet we use the resilient back propagation with weight method riedmiller 1994 which has shown superior performance than the traditional back propagation technique before using the data for ann training we normalize the values of each independent variable using the maximum and minimum values of that independent variable eq 7 also instead of using ren values as a percentage value we use them as proportions ranging 0 1 7 normalized input value original value minimum value maximum value minimum value the number of nodes in the hidden layer is a design parameter we determine the number of hidden nodes using the cross validation technique to prevent overfitting we apply cross validation only on scenario 1 data and consider its result as the optimal number of hidden nodes for ann of scenario 2 as well to do cross validation we use repeated training testing splits or monte carlo cross validation kuhn and johnson 2013 pp 71 first we consider a set of values as the candidates for the number of hidden nodes for each candidate model with an assumed number of hidden nodes we randomly split the original dataset with 5000 data into training and testing subsets we use 80 of the data i e 4000 data for training and 20 of the data i e 1000 data for testing we train the candidate models with the training subset and then use the trained model to predict the outputs of the testing subset comparing the predicted outputs and observed outputs in the testing subset presents the performance of the trained model we repeat this process 20 times for each candidate model and compute the performances average for each candidate model if average performance of a candidate model becomes lower than performance of the models with less hidden nodes this shows the onset of overfitting in order to measure the performance of models on testing subsets we use root mean square error rmse as shown in eq 8 rmse has the same unit of the dependent variable herein ren and implies how far on average the residuals i e the difference between observed ren and predicted ren are from zero we also report the coefficient of determination r2 as shown in eq 9 8 rmse 1 n ren o ren p 2 9 r 2 1 ren o ren p 2 ren o ren o 2 in eqs 8 and 9 n is the number of data in the testing subset ren o are the observed values for ren ren p are the predicted values for ren and ren o is the mean of observed values for ren after finding the optimal number of hidden nodes using cross validation we develop the final ann models by training them using all 5000 data 4 results 4 1 parallel processing speedup during one access to chpc resources employing 20 eight core computing nodes in total 160 cores required 7 h and 43 min to run 5000 simulations of scenario 1 during another access using 20 twelve core computing nodes in total 240 cores required 6 h and 49 min to run 5000 simulations of scenario 2 the latter access provides 239 slave processors to run 239 simulations in parallel because scenario 2 simulations use more stress periods and time steps than scenario 1 simulations for the same independent parameter input values one scenario 2 simulation takes longer than one scenario 1 simulation parallel processing produced at least an 80 fold speedup for scenario 1 simulations by using 160 processing cores and at least 100 fold speedup for scenario 2 simulations by using 240 processing cores the speedup value of 100 is reasonable considering that the simulations are independent of each other and there is no interaction between slaves 4 2 data analysis and parameter selection for anns to initially identify the independent variables to use in the ann model for each scenario we performed correlation analysis on the respective 5000 input output datasets specifically we developed pearson correlation coefficients that show the relative importance of each of the seven independent variables in predicting ren table 2 here we use ren 90d as the representative value of ren ren is positively related to injection rate ratio of extraction to injection rate and effective porosity note that positive correlation of injection rate denotes for a given ratio of extraction to injection rate an increase in injection rate increases ren gradient hydraulic conductivity and aquifer thickness show a considerable negative correlation with ren the greater the gradient or the transmissivity the product of conductivity and aquifer thickness the greater the background seepage velocity the more quickly the injectate departs from the wells extraction zone and the less injectate is recoverable forghani and peralta 2017b fig 3 for instance shows the effect of background gradient on concentration of the imaginary solute i e injectate in a typical asr well with a one year storage duration scenario 2 as mentioned before if gradient exceeds 0 04 all injectate departs the well s capture zone even before the extraction period begins zero concentration during extraction period so no injectate can be recovered zero ren on the other hand if gradient is negligible i e seepage velocity is negligible concentration reduction during the storage duration is negligible concentration of the imaginary solute decreases only during the extraction era therefore water recovered during the extraction era has a high concentration resulting in a high ren in both scenarios the strongest correlations are for gradient and hydraulic conductivity therefore these two are the most important variables on ren the importance of gradient even increases fig 3 by allowing one year storage of the injected water in scenario 2 the weakest correlation is for longitudinal dispersivity especially for scenario 2 because the correlation coefficient of longitudinal dispersivity is negligible for scenario 2 i e equal to 0 01 we consider that as an insignificant independent variable and therefore we do not use it for making the ann model for scenario 2 however we use longitudinal dispersivity as an input to make ann for scenario 1 note that because the inputs are randomly created values there is no correlation between them and the correlation coefficients are less than 0 02 for any pair of independent variables in summary we use all seven independent variables in table 1 as inputs to develop the scenario 1 ann but exclude longitudinal dispersivity for making the scenario 2 ann note that we did not omit longitudinal dispersivity from transport models we only do not use them in making the ann model for scenario 2 4 3 ann for scenario 1 the ann for scenario 1 has seven nodes in the input layer and eight nodes in the output layer the inputs are all seven independent variables shown in table 1 and the outputs are eight values of ren 15d to ren 120d to determine the optimal number of hidden nodes we use cross validation by considering 3 5 8 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 and 50 as the candidate numbers of hidden nodes fig 4 shows the results of cross validation fig 4 shows the mean of rmse and r2 for 20 random resamplings used for each candidate model the figure also shows the 95 confidence interval for rmse mean values of each candidate model the numerically optimal value for the number of hidden nodes is 30 because it provides the least rmse and highest r2 using more than 30 hidden nodes cause rmse to increase or fluctuate which is a sign of overfitting therefore we consider 30 as the final result of cross validation if needing to have a more parsimonious ann model one could use 15 25 hidden nodes since rmse and r2 do not improve significantly after these numbers nevertheless we choose 30 as the optimal number of ann hidden nodes in this study for a representative testing training data partition fig 5 shows the performance of the ann with 30 hidden nodes on a testing subset with 1000 data shown with blue squares after being trained with the associated training subset for example the rmse of ann predicted ren versus modflow mt3dms simulated ren at 90 days of extraction is 5 42 in fact fig 5 shows the power of the developed ann model for use as a predictive model for the same training and testing datasets used for fig 5 fig 6 shows that at 90 days of extraction most individual ann predicted rens are within 5 of modflow mt3dms simulated values and residuals are randomly scattered about zero after confirming the predictability of the ann model with 30 hidden nodes using training testing subsets we develop the final ann model by training an ann with 30 hidden nodes using all 5000 data in scenario 1 4 4 ann for scenario 2 the ann for scenario 2 has six nodes in the input layer and eight nodes in the output layer the inputs are the independent variables shown in table 1 except longitudinal dispersivity which insignificantly affects ren for scenario 2 the outputs are eight values of ren 15d to ren 120d for consistency we use the same number of hidden nodes determined for scenario 1 ann equal to 30 for the ann model of scenario 2 fig 7 shows the prediction ability of the scenario 2 ann model on a testing subset eventually to develop the final scenario 2 ann model we train an ann with 30 hidden nodes using all 5000 data in scenario 2 because the accuracy of the developed anns for predicting ren is quite suitable we did not examine alternative activation functions more advanced neural networks or other machine learning techniques e g support vector machines 4 5 application of ann models providing the asr system s hydrogeological and operational settings are within the range of parameters used to develop the ann models the developed anns can serve as reconnaissance tools for immediate ren estimation without having to prepare and run modflow mt3dms simulations this is important because a single modflow mt3dms simulation can take more than one hour the rapid estimation ability of anns encourages their inclusion within decision support systems dss jakeman et al 2011 a dss should respond to what if questions rapidly anderson et al 2015 pp 526 using modflow mt3dms models in dss systems is not as attractive because of their usual long runtimes this section demonstrates using the presented anns to analyze ren sensitivity to values of independent variables assuming one year storage of injected water i e scenario 2 and an asr well screened in one confined layer we first evaluate ren sensitivity to background gradient values for the following representative jvwcd asr well conditions aquifer thickness 61 m hydraulic conductivity 39 5 m d effective porosity 0 3 injection rate 5000 m3 day extraction rate 10 000 m3 day ratio of extraction to injection rate 2 because longitudinal dispersivity is not significant in scenario 2 the computed ren results are insensitive to changes in dispersivity fig 8 shows the changes in ren 90d for 50 gradient values selected in its specified range i e 0 0 004 note that plotting the results from running 50 modflow mt3dms simulations using 50 different gradients would produce a similar plot this figure aids identifying optimal locations for a proposed asr well for example assuming other factors remain unchanged installing the asr well in a region with background gradient less than 0 0007 could provide a 100 ren 90d ren 90d i e ren after extracting for 90 days would decline significantly for gradients exceeding 0 0007 fig 8 demonstrates that the developed ann models have captured the nonlinear relation between ren and background gradient the anns can provide similar insight into ren sensitivity to other independent variables assuming one would install the well in a location having a 0 0015 background gradient the predicted achievable ren 90d is 63 fig 8 to try to improve ren for that location one can use the ann models to investigate a change in operational factors of injection and extraction rates fig 9 shows the mutual impacts of injection and extraction rates on ren 90d for this well the figure results from numerous ann simulations by changing the values of injection rates and ratio of extraction to injection rates e i in their specified range while keeping other independent variables constant i e 39 5 m d hydraulic conductivity 0 0015 gradient 61 m aquifer thickness and 0 3 effective porosity fig 9 shows that achieving a ren 90d i e ren after extracting for 90 days exceeding 90 after one year storage requires an injection rate exceeding 7000 m3 d and an e i exceeding 2 5 i e extraction rate must exceed 17 500 m3 d an injection rate of 7000 m3 d for two months provides 420 000 m3 of injectate and an extraction rate of 17 500 m3 d for 90 days yields 1 575 000 m3 recovered water therefore for recovering 90 of the injected water achieving ren of 90 by extracting for 90 days the total extraction volume must be 3 75 times the total injection volume for this situation one infers that achieving a high ren requires that the injecting organization would already have the right to extract 2 75 times the volume that it plans to inject the jvwcd has pre existing groundwater pumping rights and uses asr to increase their total legal groundwater pumping other organizations subject to the same conditions would require pre existing or new groundwater pumping rights to achieve high ren values in the absence of pre existing groundwater right however results such as fig 9 imply that using ren as the criterion for gaining credit for the recharged water will result in groundwater depletion because much higher extraction than injection is needed for a satisfactory ren regardless of whether or how ren is used as a criterion for gaining credit for aquifer recharge via asr the developed anns provide rapid estimation of injectate recovery plots such as fig 9 can help water managers evaluate the usefulness of a counting molecules procedure using ren index for managing asr systems 4 6 application for partially penetrating wells or wells screened in multiple layers development of the anns assumed fully penetrating wells screened in one layer systems however the anns also reasonably estimate ren for partially penetrating wells or for wells screened in multiple aquifer layers that have different horizontal hydraulic conductivities if negligible vertical flow occurs between screen intervals this condition occurs if geologic material between the screens has low vertical hydraulic conductivity or if confining units exists between aquifer layers in such a situation injectates in different screen intervals act relatively independent of each other and separate screen intervals act similarly to fully penetrating wells pavelic et al 2006 ward et al 2008 also each screen interval receives a proportion of total injected water based on its transmissivity t i with respect to the sum of all interval transmissivities t i therefore by inputting a screen interval length instead of total aquifer thickness and the rate of injection into the interval the user can employ the anns to compute the ren for each individual screen interval ren i finally the ren for the entire asr well equals 10 ren well ren i t i t i forghani and peralta 2017c used the developed anns with eq 10 as the surrogate ren simulator within a coupled simulation optimization model developed for the jvwcd asr system to verify the accuracy of the surrogate simulator for multi layer asr wells they compared ren simulator results with the results from coupled regional 7 layer modflow and mt3dms models for accuracy the regional transport model uses the mnw2 package konikow et al 2009 and field values of installed asr well screen intervals for one of the optimal strategies obtained in forghani and peralta 2017c fig 10 compares the rens computed from the anns with the rens computed from the transport model this figure shows the acceptable accuracy of using the anns and eq 10 for estimating ren for multi layer wells 4 7 software development the software presented here includes a stand alone executable containing the ann models modflow and mt3dms executables to allow testing new situations and a graphical user interface gui to facilitate using the executables the final ann models for scenarios 1 and 2 contain a set of optimized weights as shown in fig 1 the anns executable uses these weights in equations similar to eqs 4 and 5 to compute ren for user specified inputs the gui and the ann executable allow analyzing the sensitivity of ren to changes in one or two independent variables e g figs 8 and 9 respectively assuming other independent variable values remain constant fig 11 shows a screenshot of the software as used to develop fig 9 the gui can also compare the results of the ann models with the results of actual transport modeling by invoking modflow mt3dms models developed for fig 2 for selected strategies these strategies are usually selected after conducting sensitivity analysis with ann models the developed software is available from peralta web bluezone usu edu 5 conclusions recovery effectiveness ren is the proportion of the injected water that the same asr well can recover the study presents development of software for rapidly estimating ren in fresh water homogeneous aquifers the software development involves training distinct ann models to estimate ren for two scenarios without and with storage of injected water we trained and tested the ann models using input and output data from numerous modflow mt3dms simulations for considered scenarios sensitivity analyses show that gradient and hydraulic conductivity most significantly impact ren and dispersivity has little impact especially for the scenario allowing one year of injectate storage before beginning extraction the developed software is a reconnaissance tool for immediate ren estimation for the ranges of hydrogeological and operational settings used in developing the ann models using the reported software avoids the need to prepare and run modflow mt3dms simulations for situations lying within tested ranges of operational and hydrogeological parameters for the considered scenarios the software allows water managers to evaluate the usefulness of a counting molecules method in managing asr systems plots such as fig 9 developed for an asr well aid investigating the possibility of achieving a satisfactory ren without

transport of materials within catchments investigating the flow sediment relationships across multiple timescales can reveal trends related to the effects of natural and human caused changes to catchments this study chose fourteen main catchments in the loess plateau of china which are the major sediment sources of yellow river to extract the temporal patterns of flow sediment relationships during the 1950s 2014 period the study revealed quantifiable effects of land use cover changes lucc on the variability of flow sediment relationships the lucc induced by the soil and water conservation measures swcms during 1970 1999 and vegetation restoration campaign since 2000 resulted in significant reductions of annual streamflow sediment yield and sediment concentration the mean daily sediment concentration under different flow conditions also decreased greatly the flow sediment relationships revealed time dependence over different stages and time scales before 2000 the annual and monthly flow sediment relationships could be generally characterized by the linear functions and the power law sediment rating curve was able to describe the daily flow sediment relationship as vegetation restoration campaign took effect the flow sediment relationship became much weaker which could not be described by a clear relationship this suggests that the variability of flow sediment relationships over the entire period was mainly regulated by the vegetation restoration campaign in addition the sediment concentration exhibited a linear decreasing relationship with the area under land use cover treatment in this way the study has brought out the roles of ecological restoration measures in controlling the temporal variability of flow sediment relationships at the catchment scale keywords flow sediment relationship time dependence land use cover change ecological restoration loess plateau 1 introduction the accumulated consequences of climate change and diverse human activities have led to considerable global alterations of catchment hydrological regimes in recent decades milly et al 2005 syvitski et al 2005 cohen et al 2014 streamflow and sediment transport in rivers are key vectors of carbon and nutrients thereby controlling ecosystem health in river basins and playing a vital part in global biogeochemical cycles syvitski et al 2005 darby et al 2016 besides streamflow sediment load and suspended sediment concentration ssc the flow sediment relationship is also a fundamental element to determine sediment dynamics in rivers and all of them together provide insights to the erosion and transport of materials within catchments rustomji et al 2008 zheng et al 2012 warrick et al 2013 changes in runoff and soil erosion on landscapes and the resulting changes in water discharge sediment transport rate and flow sediment relationship have great environmental and societal consequences particularly since they can be brought about by climatic changes and human induced land use cover changes lucc syvitski et al 2005 warrick and rubin 2007 rustomji et al 2008 ahn et al 2017 previous studies usually focused on detecting the changes of streamflow and sediment load and investigating the roles of climate change and human activities in the changes walling and fang 2003 milly et al 2005 milliman and farnsworth 2011 liu et al 2013 cohen et al 2014 mutema et al 2015 understanding the temporal spatial variability of flow sediment relationships and the dominant mechanisms behind these changes is also an important issue in the development of strategies for sustainable land and water management in river basins vercruysse et al 2017 the suspended sediment load of rivers is controlled by sources transport and storage of sediment within the catchment warrick and rubin 2007 and the sediment load is typically strongly correlated with discharge morehead et al 2003 the sediment rating curve ssc discharge relationship on intra event or daily timescale is a powerful tool for understanding the complex flow sediment relationships and predicting sediment dynamics as a function of river discharge warrick 2015 ahn et al 2017 the ssc discharge relationships may change over time season or discharge in ways that can serve as useful indicators of changes in river system function caused by anthropogenic activities such as land disturbance and watershed management zhang et al 2017b morehead et al 2003 indicated that the suspended sediment load carried by rivers varies spatially and temporally and that sediment rating curve parameters exhibit time dependent trends warrick et al 2013 indicated that sediment discharge and sediment rating curves from coastal watersheds of northern california presented substantial inter annual variations in response to land use and climate variability and the sediment rating curves without considerations of time dependent trends may result in significant errors in sediment yield estimation gao et al 2013a indicated that the suspended sediment transport showed complex and unpredictable patterns at the intra event temporal scale but the event specific sediment yield can be generally characterized by a proportional model with event runoff depth for all selected variable sized watersheds 0 002 km2 149 33 km2 in walnut gulch of southeastern arizona usa the above studies indicated that the flow sediment relationships varied with temporal scales vercruysse et al 2017 it is necessary to investigate the flow sediment relationships across multiple timescales from coarse annual and monthly to fine daily and event scales to reveal trends related to the effects of natural and human caused changes to watersheds this is especially valuable and crucial for severely eroded areas such as the loess plateau lp in china the lp 33 41 n 41 16 n 100 52 e 114 33 e is located in the middle reaches of the yellow river yr basin and contributes nearly 90 of the yr sediment wang et al 2016 li et al 2017 the historically severe soil erosion in the lp is due to low vegetation cover frequent high intensity rainstorms in summer months highly erodible loessial soil steep topography and long term intensive cultivation rustomji et al 2008 to control severe soil erosion in the lp several soil and water conservation measures swcms including terrace and check dam construction afforestation and pasture reestablishment have been implemented since the 1950s yao et al 2011 zhao et al 2017 a large ecological restoration campaign the grain for green gfg project which involved returning steep croplands to forest and pasture lands was implemented towards the end of the 1990s chen et al 2015 feng et al 2016 meanwhile the climate in the lp region has been experiencing both warming and drying trends i e increased potential evapotranspiration and reduced precipitation since the 1950s zhang et al 2012 2014 miao et al 2016 these extensive lucc have dramatically altered the hydrological regimes including streamflow sediment load and flow sediment relationships in the lp in combination with the climate change it was observed that the streamflow and sediment yields within the lp have exhibited a predictable downward trend over the past six decades zhao et al 2017 resulting in approximately a 70 decrease of sediment yield in the yr miao et al 2010 2011 wang et al 2016 many studies have detected the influences of lucc and precipitation variability on streamflow and sediment load changes within the lp and it was generally accepted that the largest reductions of streamflow and sediment load was caused by lucc rustomji et al 2008 liang et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 gao et al 2011 gao et al 2013b 2016 2017a b furthermore the effects of lucc and precipitation variability on long term changes in streamflow and sediment load showed interesting spatio temporal patterns arising from the significant variability of climate and catchment characteristics across the lp gao et al 2016 2017a a few studies have been conducted on the flow sediment relationships in the catchments of the lp rustomji et al 2008 indicated that annual mean sediment concentration in 7 of the 11 catchments within the central region of the lp exhibited a statistically significant decreasing trend over time during 1950s 2000 and variations in the daily sediment rating curves showed little difference between before and after change point periods for two typical catchments one each that did and did not experience significant reductions in annual sediment concentration gao et al 2012 used the linear regression equations to detect dynamic relations between monthly streamflow and sediment load over 1950s 2005 in seven selected catchments of the lp and showed that the swcms and the gfg project considerably weakened the sediment yield capacity and the flow sediment relationships in most of the study catchments zheng et al 2012 investigated the flow sediment relationship on multiple temporal intra event inter event and annual and spatial plot sub watershed and watershed scales based on recorded data with the periods from 6 to 20 years during 1950s 1995 their results indicated that the proportional runoff sediment yield relationship proposed by zheng et al 2008 was well applicable from plot to watershed at the event time scale and the relationship between annual runoff and annual sediment yield became linear with a non zero intercept at the watershed scale zhang et al 2017a investigated the variations of daily sediment rating curves in beiluo river basin during 1957 2009 and indicated that the flow sediment dynamics changed as a result of ecological restoration the above studies usually focused on the flow sediment relationships of a single temporal scale furthermore some studies such as rustomji et al 2008 and zheng et al 2008 2012 only considered the data before 2000 which could not account for the effects of significant vegetation restoration caused by the gfg project on flow sediment relationships it is therefore essential to investigate the multiscale variability of flow sediment relationships during recent decades on the regional scale in the loess plateau moreover the quantitative effects of engineering measures and vegetation restoration on flow sediment relationships need further study this is important for sustainable ecosystem restoration and water resources planning and management within the lp and it can also provide decision support for streamflow and sediment regulation of the yr this study chose fourteen main catchments in the middle part of the lp which were the major sediment sources of yr to extract the temporal spatial patterns of flow sediment relationships during 1950s 2014 the specific objectives of this study therefore are to 1 investigate the variations of flow sediment relationships on the annual monthly and daily scales 2 detect changes of flow sediment relationships over the entire period and 3 quantify the effects of swcms and gfg project on changes of flow sediment relationships 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is located in the middle of lp between the toudaoguai to longmen hydrological stations in the mainstream of the yr fig 1 this area is usually referred to as the coarse sandy hilly catchments cshc region the main stream that flows through the cshc region is 733 km long and covers an area of 12 97 104 km2 accounting for 14 8 of the entire yr basin most of the sediment yield of the lp is produced in the cshs region which supplies over 70 of total sediment load in the yr especially coarse sand rustomji et al 2008 the cshc region was the focus of our efforts to investigate the variation of sediment load and flow sediment relationships in the lp the cshc region experiences arid to semi arid climate conditions the annual precipitation in the cshc region during 1956 2014 is 443 mm on average and varied from 580 mm in the southeast to lower than 300 mm in the northwest mcvicar et al 2007 the precipitation that occurs during the flood season june september usually takes the form of high intensity rainstorms and accounts for 72 of the annual rainfall total correspondingly about 45 of the annual runoff and 88 of the annual sediment yield within the cshc region are generated during the flood season especially due to a small number of intensive rainstorms sui et al 2009 the northwestern part of the cshc is relatively flat while the southeastern part is characterized by a more finely dissected landscape rustomji et al 2008 fourteen main catchments along the north south transect within the cshc study area were selected for study fig 1 these catchments account for 57 4 of the cshc area and contribute about 69 and 71 of streamflow and sediment load of the overall cshc respectively based on observed hydrological data during 1956 2014 characteristics of these catchments are shown in table 1 2 2 data monthly streamflow and sediment load data of the fourteen catchments and the whole cshc region differences of value between the toudaoguai and longmen gauging station during 1956 2014 were obtained from the bureau of hydrology yellow river conservancy commission of china daily streamflow and sediment load data were available for nine catchments catchments 3 9 11 and 13 daily rainfall data from 1956 to 2014 at 66 meteorological stations in and around the cshc region were provided by the national meteorological information center of china the rainfall data were spatially averaged across the study area using the co kriging interpolation algorithm and arcgis software which took a digital elevation model dem as an additional input with the hydro meteorological data including p mm streamflow q mm and sediment load s t specific sediment yield defined as ssy s a t km 2 where a is the drainage area of the hydrological station km2 and suspended sediment concentration defined as ssc s q a kg m 3 were estimated for each catchment 2 3 methods 2 3 1 trend test the significance of the trends in annual meteorological and hydrological time series was estimated by the non parametric mann kendall m k test mann 1945 kendall 1975 a precondition for using the mk test is that the series are independent in fact climatic and hydrological series may generally display serial correlation which can complicate the identification of trends in this study the trend tree pre whitening tfpw method of yue and wang 2002 was used to remove the auto correlations before executing the trend analysis there was no residual autocorrelation remaining after performing the tfpw a z statistic was obtained from the m k test on the whitened series with the tfpw method a negative value of z indicates a downward trend and vice versa the slope of the trend was estimated as follows sen 1968 hirsch et al 1982 1 β median x j x i j i for all i j where β is the magnitude of the trend and xi and xj are the sequential data values in periods i and j respectively 2 3 2 flow sediment relationships analysis the flow sediment relationship was investigated on annual monthly and daily scales as nearly all the sediment load occurred from may to october and there was no sediment load observation in some months during november to april in some catchments the monthly values from may to october only were used in analyzing monthly flow sediment relationship to make results comparable the proportional linear power and logarithmic functions were used in the regression analysis to detect the best fit ssy q relationships on annual and monthly scales of the fourteen catchments the daily flow sediment relationships were analyzed for the nine catchments with the available daily streamflow and sediment load data the sediment rating curve was used to investigate the relationship between daily ssc and streamflow discharge q that can be generally represented by warrick 2015 2 ssc m q n where m and n are the intercept and slope parameters in the rating curves determined by regression analysis using obtained data respectively the rating exponent n is the slope of the line relating ssc and q in log log space and represents the strength of the power relationship log m is the vertical offset value of the rating curve where q is equivalent to unit discharge the changes of the parameters n reflect the power of the river to erode and transport sediment and those of parameters m represent alteration of the erodibility and or supply of sediment in the watershed gao et al 2013a warrick 2015 in this study the annual monthly and daily flow sediment relationships were derived at three stages during the full data period of 1956 2014 the first period was considered the reference period as the effects of human activities were slight and could be ignored wang et al 2016 the reference period ended in 1969 for all the catchments except yuanyan catchment with 1967 1979 as the reference period during the second stage period 2 ending in 1999 numerous swcms were implemented during the third stage period 3 2000 2014 a large ecological restoration campaign gfg project was launched in 1999 3 results and discussion 3 1 changes

respectively the annual q s and ssc across the cshc region showed significantly decreasing trends 0 80 mm yr 1 p 0 001 0 19 gt yr 1 p 0 001 and 1 74 kg m3 p 0 001 respectively over the past six decades whereas the decrease of annual p was not significant 1 25 mm yr 1 p 0 085 fig 2 the annual average reductions of p q s and ssc in the whole cshc region were equivalent to 0 28 2 32 3 46 and 1

the trend was significant in only the xinshui and zhouchuan catchments p 0 05 the annual q ssy and ssc showed significant decreasing trends in all the catchments and most of the decreases were at the

1 29 20 350 81 t km 2 yr 1 and 3 93 kg m 3 yr 1 1 61 5 67 kg m 3 yr 1 respectively compared to the reference period the mean annual precipitation decreased by 13 02 4 83 17 28 and 12 21 3 86 16 23 on average in period 2 and period 3 respectively from period 2 to period 3 the change of mean annual precipitation was slight increased by 0 95 on average with a decrease of 0 38 3 29 in five catchments and an increase in the remaining catchments 0 03 4 54 in contrast to annual p the reductions of mean annual q ssy and ssc were clearly more evident table 3 with respect to the reference period the reduction was 35 01 8 53 53 26 48 07 29 08 66 74 and 24 13 1 48 to 42 65 for q ssy and ssc during period 2 and the decreasing rate was even more in period 3 with values of 62 54 20 73 84 29 86 29 52 75 98 17 and 70 61 43 77 90 04 respectively from period 2 to period 3 the q ssy and ssc decreased by 43 64 74 47 and 61 40 on average respectively 3 2 annual and monthly flow sediment relationship the regression analysis indicated that the linear function was the best one to describe the annual ssy q relationships and the spatial distribution of r 2 values and slope of the linear equations are shown in fig 3 the performance of the linear function was good during the reference period and period 2 but the scatter was considerable in period 3 during the reference period the r 2 values of the regression were greater than 0 90 in eight catchments and the r 2 value of three catchments had the range of 0 80 r 2 0 90 and the other three had the range of 0 70 r 2 0 80 fig 3a during period 2 the performance of linear regression somewhat decreased with r 2 value greater than 0 80 in eight catchments and the remaining six catchments had r 2 value between 0 60 and 0 80 fig 3b compared to reference period and period 2 the annual ssy q relationships in period 3 became much weaker which could not be described by a clear functional relationship including the linear equation with r 2 value less than 0 60 in ten catchments fig 3c furthermore the slope of the linear regression equations decreased during period 2 and period 3 compared to that in the reference period and the decrease was considerable during period 3 fig 3 this result indicated that the sediment production capability of streamflow reduced greatly during period 3 the annual flow sediment relationship varied from catchment to catchment and showed a spatial pattern fig 3 based on the slopes of the regression equations between annual streamflow and sediment yield during the reference period the 14 catchments were classified into four groups group 1 0 04 a 0 06 group 2 0 03 a 0 04 group 3 0 02 a 0 03 group 4 a 0 02 which indicated that the sediment production capability of annual streamflow was different among the catchments fig 3a there were six five two and one catchments in group 1 group 2 group 3 and group 4 respectively the spatial patterns of the annual flow sediment relationship during period 2 were similar to that during reference period fig 3a and b during period 3 the spatial patterns of the annual flow sediment relationship were clearly different from those during the reference period and period 2 compare fig 3c against fig 3a and b there were three groups with four catchments in group 3 nine catchments in group 4 and only one catchment in group 1 the monthly ssy q showed similar spatio temporal patterns of linear relationships as those on annual scale fig 4 the annual and monthly ssy q relationships during the three stages in the yanhe catchment were plotted in fig 5 as an example the linear regression lines during period 2 were slightly located below those during the reference period and the lines during period 3 with much decreased r 2 values 0 60 were evidently situated below the lines during reference period and period 2 with r 2 values larger than 0 80 fig 5 which suggest the evolution of the annual and monthly ssy q relationships as indicated before the above results indicated that annual or monthly ssy could be predicted by q with the linear function during reference period and period 2 whereas it lost predictive power in period 3 fig 6 shows the change in annual ssy δssya versus change in q δqa and change in annual ssc δssca between two compared periods for the fourteen catchments it can be seen that the δssya and δssca between the reference period and period 3 p3 p1 or that between period 2 and period 3 p3 p2 were greater than those between the reference period and period 2 p2 p1 the δssya was significantly linearly related with δqa with r 2 value greater than 0 60 and p value less than 0 001 fig 6a furthermore the regression line of changes between reference period and period 1 were situated below the lines of changes of reference period vs period 3 or period 2 vs period 3 this result indicates that a specified reduction in qa from the reference period to period 3 or from period 2 to period 3 can lead to a larger decrease of ssya with respect to that from reference period to period 2 the δssya was also linearly related with δssca but the relationship was weaker than that between δssya and δqa as indicated by the lower r 2 value and larger p value fig 6b especially the δssya was not significantly correlated with the δssca between the reference period and period 3 p 0 104 the above results indicated that the decrease of ssya was dominated by reduction in qa whereas the reduction in δssca explained only partly the decrease of ssya 3 3 daily flow sediment relationship the sediment rating curves between daily ssc and q during three stages for the nine catchments are shown in table 4 and the curves in a log log diagram of the yanhe catchment are plotted in fig 7 as an example as shown in fig 7 daily ssc and q were positively related and each varied by several orders of magnitude at moderate streamflow discharge 100 102 m3 s the variability in ssc was highest with a span of 3 4 orders of magnitude at higher streamflows 102 m3 s the ssc is distributed within the range of 102 103 kg m3 and approached a certain plateau the power law function was satisfactory to describe the sediment rating curves during the reference period with most of the r 2 value greater than 0 50 and the performance decreased somewhat during period 2 table 4 however the ssc under high flow conditions was overestimated by the power law function and the daily ssc q relationship showed considerable scatter during period 3 which could not be captured by the sediment rating curve furthermore the slope of sediment rating curve n decreased in period 2 and period 3 with respect to reference period especially during period 3 associated with considerable decrease of n for most of the catchments table 4 this result indicated that the transport capacity of runoff decreased and the sensitivity of sediment concentration to discharge has been on a decreasing trend in contrast to n the changes of parameter m in the sediment rating curve were complex in some catchments m decreased whereas it increased in other catchments from the reference period to period 3 table 4 the daily flow sediment relationship also showed somewhat spatial pattern with the spatial variability of parameter n during the reference period and period 2 the n values of kuye 3 and xinshui 13 catchments were much lower than those of other catchments the spatial pattern of n changed greatly in period 3 compared to reference period and period 2 during period 3 the n values in the 14 catchments could be divided into three groups with catchments 7 8 and 11 in group 1 1 50 n 1 80 catchments 6 9 and 13 in group 2 1 20 n 1 30 and catchments 3 4 and 5 in group 3 0 60 n 0 90 to further investigate the daily flow sediment relationship the mean daily ssc under different flow conditions among the three stages was compared in fig 8 four flow conditions were classified including extreme high 0 10 high 10 25 moderate 25 75 and low flow 75 compared to the reference period the mean daily ssc under extreme high high moderate and low flow conditions decreased by 21 04 51 18 52 68 and 45 93 on average in period 2 and the reduction was even more in period 3 with values of 67 36 85 51 87 18 and 76 94 respectively from period 2 to period 3 the reduction of mean daily ssc under the four flow conditions was 58 24 69 55 72 44 and 54 58 respectively the above results indicated that the sediment production ability under different flow conditions decreased from reference period to period 2 and from period 2 to period 3 3 4 effects of land use cover change on sediment concentration in order to quantify the effects of swcm on flow sediment relationships the relationships between the decadal sediment concentration and the fraction of area treated with erosion control measures in the 14 catchments were analysed and the results are presented in table 5 the decadal sediment concentration ssc decreased linearly with the fraction of treated land surface area a swcm in all catchments 3 ssc k a swcm l the correlations were significant in eleven catchments p 0 05 with r 2 ranging from 0 62 to 0 95 table 5 the effects of swcm on sediment concentration change show a spatial pattern based on the slope of the regression equation between the sediment concentration and fraction of the treated area the catchments were classified into four groups in fig 9 group 1 2 0 k 3 0 group 2 3 0 k 4 0 group 3 4 0 k 5 0 and group 4 6 0 k 8 0 there were four three four and three catchments in group 1 group 2 group 3 and group 4 respectively this indicated that the degree of sediment load impacted by conservation measures was different among the catchments 3 5 discussion this study indicated that the flow sediment relationships were significantly different before 2000 and after 2000 in the location of study before 2000 i e during reference period and period 2 the annual and monthly flow sediment relationships could be generally characterized by linear functions and the power law sediment rating curve could be used to describe the daily flow sediment relationship during the reference period there was minimal lucc and the streamflow and sediment yield were mainly controlled by precipitation gao et al 2016 2017a during period 2 numerous swcms were implemented the engineering measures especially check dams had immediate and substantial effects on reducing stremflow and sediment load and both of them were retained within the catchment rustomji et al 2008 the reduction of sediment yield during period 2 was mainly caused by decrease of streamflow zhang et al 2017a therefore there was a little change in sediment yield under certain streamflow and flow sediment relationships between reference period and period 2 as evident from fig 5 as vegetation restoration campaign took effect since 2000 the flow sediment relationships became much weaker and the flow sediment relationship functions during reference period and period 2 lost any predictive power establishing perennial vegetation cover was considered one of the most effective measures to stabilize soils and minimize erosion farley et al 2005 liu et al 2014 the substantially improved vegetation cover in the lp greatly decreased the sediment production ability of streamflow the reduction of sediment load caused by vegetation restoration was greater than that of streamflow as evident from table 3 this was due to vegetation restoration that could contribute to an increase of baseflow zheng 2015 wang et al 2016 therefore the flow sediment relationships during period 3 were uncertain which was difficult to be predicted by clear functional relationships the flow sediment relationships changed over stages and they also depended on time scales annual monthly and daily the annual or monthly flow sediment relationships could be described well by linear functions whereas the daily flow sediment relationship was described by a power law sediment rating curve which exhibited scatter at high flows the time dependence of flow sediment relationships was mainly due to the nonlinear and intermittent runoff sediment generation processes especially on fine scale vercruysse et al 2017 there was certain lag effect of sediment export with respect to streamflow in the catchment which was more evident in larger catchment the lag effect could be reduced on coarse time scales resulting in the explicit annual and monthly flow relationships whereas the daily flow sediment relationships were more uncertain and the scatter about the sediment rating curve increased with increasing flow gao et al 2013a in this case the nonlinear and preferably nonparametric fitting approach such as lowess locally weighted scatterplot smoothing fitting techniques should be considered especially for situations in which a curvature existed between the discharge and sediment concentration data at high flows as shown in fig 7 warrick et al 2013 zhang et al 2017b the connections of flow sediment relationships across multiple timescales need further detailed study given the considerable effects of climate change and human activities besides the above temporal variations over different stages and across different timescales the flow sediment relationships also showed spatial pattern from figs 3 and 4 it could be found that the sediment production capability by streamflow in the catchments of the northwestern part was greater than that in the southeastern part the effects of swcms on sediment concentration reduction were greater in the northwestern part compared to those in the southeastern part fig 9 the spatial pattern of the flow sediment relationships mainly depended on the landscape properties among catchments including vegetation cover topography soil properties as well as precipitation characteristics the catchments in the northwestern part had low leaf area index lai compared to those in the southeastern part gao et al 2017a the lower vegetation cover was the main reason for the greater effects of streamflow on sediment yield and stronger flow sediment relationships in the northwestern part in order to fully explore this the mapping of information of catchment characteristics into runoff and sediment yield models and simulation under different land surface and climate scenarios would be needed the temporal spatial variations of flow sediment relationships were mainly caused by the extensive lucc the increase in forestland of the study area was 12 44 and the change in cropland only 0 05 was negligible from 1975 to 2000 and the increase of lai 0 003 yr 1 p 0 11 was not significant during 1982 1999 gao et al 2017a in contrast the percentage of swcms increased greatly from 1 72 in the 1950s to 17 39 in the 1990s yao et al 2011 it is generally accepted that the sediment load reductions before 2000 were primarily caused by the implementation of swcms after 2000 cropland decreased greatly 26 69 and forestland increased greatly 36 20 induced by the gfg or reforestation project and lai increased significantly during 2000 2011 0 024 yr 1 p 0 01 gao et al 2017a the combined effects of substantial vegetation cover and engineering measures weakened the effects of streamflow on sediment yield and made the flow sediment relationships uncertain although the engineering measures especially the check dams utilized much smaller area compared to the biotic treatments they substantially trapped streamflow and sediment load the check dam is an effective sedimentation mitigation and sediment could be fully deposited before the dam it was reported that the check dam sedimentation storage in the lp was 230 108 m3 510 108 m3 650 108 m3 and 700 108 m3 in the 1980s 1990s 2000s and 2010s respectively yao et al 2011 however the effectiveness of engineering measures decreased over time as they were progressively filled with sediments and subsequently destroyed by floods vegetation restoration would play a greater role in regulating the variability of flow sediment relationships and controlling soil erosion it should be noted that much of the sediment yield in the lp may be caused during only a few major storms rustomji et al 2008 the inter annual and intra annual patterns of variability of precipitation including the distribution of storm events may also contributed to the observed temporal spatial variations of flow sediment relationships in recent years the rainstorm events in the lp increased and it had a significant effect on the soil erosion and changed the flow sediment relationship further concern should be paid on the flood runoff and sediment exploration of the detailed effects of lucc and precipitation variability on flow sediment relationships will require a more physically based model that can account for fine scale catchment characteristics and rainfall variability 4 conclusions this study investigated the multiscale annual monthly and daily variability of flow sediment relationships over different periods during 1950s 2014 in 14 main catchments of the loess plateau in china during the reference period 1950s 1969 with minimal lucc and period 2 1970 1999 with numerous ecological measures implemented the annual and monthly flow sediment relationships could be well described by linear functions and the power law sediment rating curve was able to describe the daily flow sediment relationship in spite of some scatter under high flow there were no considerable differences in flow sediment relationships between reference period and period 2 during period 3 as vegetation restoration campaign took effect since 2000 the flow sediment relationships became much weaker which could not be predicted by the functions established during the reference period and period 2 or any other relationships the effects of lucc on the variability of flow sediment relationships were quantified through the controls on sediment concentration the mean daily sediment concentration under different flow conditions decreased greatly the sediment concentration was heavily dependent on the area under land use cover treatment exhibiting a linear decreasing relationship with considerable variation in slope among the 14 catchments it can thus be concluded that the flow sediment relationships revealed both time dependence and systematic spatial pattern and it appears that the variability of flow sediment relationships was mainly regulated by the vegetation restoration measures acknowledgements this research was funded by the national key

transport of materials within catchments investigating the flow sediment relationships across multiple timescales can reveal trends related to the effects of natural and human caused changes to catchments this study chose fourteen main catchments in the loess plateau of china which are the major sediment sources of yellow river to extract the temporal patterns of flow sediment relationships during the 1950s 2014 period the study revealed quantifiable effects of land use cover changes lucc on the variability of flow sediment relationships the lucc induced by the soil and water conservation measures swcms during 1970 1999 and vegetation restoration campaign since 2000 resulted in significant reductions of annual streamflow sediment yield and sediment concentration the mean daily sediment concentration under different flow conditions also decreased greatly the flow sediment relationships revealed time dependence over different stages and time scales before 2000 the annual and monthly flow sediment relationships could be generally characterized by the linear functions and the power law sediment rating curve was able to describe the daily flow sediment relationship as vegetation restoration campaign took effect the flow sediment relationship became much weaker which could not be described by a clear relationship this suggests that the variability of flow sediment relationships over the entire period was mainly regulated by the vegetation restoration campaign in addition the sediment concentration exhibited a linear decreasing relationship with the area under land use cover treatment in this way the study has brought out the roles of ecological restoration measures in controlling the temporal variability of flow sediment relationships at the catchment scale keywords flow sediment relationship time dependence land use cover change ecological restoration loess plateau 1 introduction the accumulated consequences of climate change and diverse human activities have led to considerable global alterations of catchment hydrological regimes in recent decades milly et al 2005 syvitski et al 2005 cohen et al 2014 streamflow and sediment transport in rivers are key vectors of carbon and nutrients thereby controlling ecosystem health in river basins and playing a vital part in global biogeochemical cycles syvitski et al 2005 darby et al 2016 besides streamflow sediment load and suspended sediment concentration ssc the flow sediment relationship is also a fundamental element to determine sediment dynamics in rivers and all of them together provide insights to the erosion and transport of materials within catchments rustomji et al 2008 zheng et al 2012 warrick et al 2013 changes in runoff and soil erosion on landscapes and the resulting changes in water discharge sediment transport rate and flow sediment relationship have great environmental and societal consequences particularly since they can be brought about by climatic changes and human induced land use cover changes lucc syvitski et al 2005 warrick and rubin 2007 rustomji et al 2008 ahn et al 2017 previous studies usually focused on detecting the changes of streamflow and sediment load and investigating the roles of climate change and human activities in the changes walling and fang 2003 milly et al 2005 milliman and farnsworth 2011 liu et al 2013 cohen et al 2014 mutema et al 2015 understanding the temporal spatial variability of flow sediment relationships and the dominant mechanisms behind these changes is also an important issue in the development of strategies for sustainable land and water management in river basins vercruysse et al 2017 the suspended sediment load of rivers is controlled by sources transport and storage of sediment within the catchment warrick and rubin 2007 and the sediment load is typically strongly correlated with discharge morehead et al 2003 the sediment rating curve ssc discharge relationship on intra event or daily timescale is a powerful tool for understanding the complex flow sediment relationships and predicting sediment dynamics as a function of river discharge warrick 2015 ahn et al 2017 the ssc discharge relationships may change over time season or discharge in ways that can serve as useful indicators of changes in river system function caused by anthropogenic activities such as land disturbance and watershed management zhang et al 2017b morehead et al 2003 indicated that the suspended sediment load carried by rivers varies spatially and temporally and that sediment rating curve parameters exhibit time dependent trends warrick et al 2013 indicated that sediment discharge and sediment rating curves from coastal watersheds of northern california presented substantial inter annual variations in response to land use and climate variability and the sediment rating curves without considerations of time dependent trends may result in significant errors in sediment yield estimation gao et al 2013a indicated that the suspended sediment transport showed complex and unpredictable patterns at the intra event temporal scale but the event specific sediment yield can be generally characterized by a proportional model with event runoff depth for all selected variable sized watersheds 0 002 km2 149 33 km2 in walnut gulch of southeastern arizona usa the above studies indicated that the flow sediment relationships varied with temporal scales vercruysse et al 2017 it is necessary to investigate the flow sediment relationships across multiple timescales from coarse annual and monthly to fine daily and event scales to reveal trends related to the effects of natural and human caused changes to watersheds this is especially valuable and crucial for severely eroded areas such as the loess plateau lp in china the lp 33 41 n 41 16 n 100 52 e 114 33 e is located in the middle reaches of the yellow river yr basin and contributes nearly 90 of the yr sediment wang et al 2016 li et al 2017 the historically severe soil erosion in the lp is due to low vegetation cover frequent high intensity rainstorms in summer months highly erodible loessial soil steep topography and long term intensive cultivation rustomji et al 2008 to control severe soil erosion in the lp several soil and water conservation measures swcms including terrace and check dam construction afforestation and pasture reestablishment have been implemented since the 1950s yao et al 2011 zhao et al 2017 a large ecological restoration campaign the grain for green gfg project which involved returning steep croplands to forest and pasture lands was implemented towards the end of the 1990s chen et al 2015 feng et al 2016 meanwhile the climate in the lp region has been experiencing both warming and drying trends i e increased potential evapotranspiration and reduced precipitation since the 1950s zhang et al 2012 2014 miao et al 2016 these extensive lucc have dramatically altered the hydrological regimes including streamflow sediment load and flow sediment relationships in the lp in combination with the climate change it was observed that the streamflow and sediment yields within the lp have exhibited a predictable downward trend over the past six decades zhao et al 2017 resulting in approximately a 70 decrease of sediment yield in the yr miao et al 2010 2011 wang et al 2016 many studies have detected the influences of lucc and precipitation variability on streamflow and sediment load changes within the lp and it was generally accepted that the largest reductions of streamflow and sediment load was caused by lucc rustomji et al 2008 liang et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 gao et al 2011 gao et al 2013b 2016 2017a b furthermore the effects of lucc and precipitation variability on long term changes in streamflow and sediment load showed interesting spatio temporal patterns arising from the significant variability of climate and catchment characteristics across the lp gao et al 2016 2017a a few studies have been conducted on the flow sediment relationships in the catchments of the lp rustomji et al 2008 indicated that annual mean sediment concentration in 7 of the 11 catchments within the central region of the lp exhibited a statistically significant decreasing trend over time during 1950s 2000 and variations in the daily sediment rating curves showed little difference between before and after change point periods for two typical catchments one each that did and did not experience significant reductions in annual sediment concentration gao et al 2012 used the linear regression equations to detect dynamic relations between monthly streamflow and sediment load over 1950s 2005 in seven selected catchments of the lp and showed that the swcms and the gfg project considerably weakened the sediment yield capacity and the flow sediment relationships in most of the study catchments zheng et al 2012 investigated the flow sediment relationship on multiple temporal intra event inter event and annual and spatial plot sub watershed and watershed scales based on recorded data with the periods from 6 to 20 years during 1950s 1995 their results indicated that the proportional runoff sediment yield relationship proposed by zheng et al 2008 was well applicable from plot to watershed at the event time scale and the relationship between annual runoff and annual sediment yield became linear with a non zero intercept at the watershed scale zhang et al 2017a investigated the variations of daily sediment rating curves in beiluo river basin during 1957 2009 and indicated that the flow sediment dynamics changed as a result of ecological restoration the above studies usually focused on the flow sediment relationships of a single temporal scale furthermore some studies such as rustomji et al 2008 and zheng et al 2008 2012 only considered the data before 2000 which could not account for the effects of significant vegetation restoration caused by the gfg project on flow sediment relationships it is therefore essential to investigate the multiscale variability of flow sediment relationships during recent decades on the regional scale in the loess plateau moreover the quantitative effects of engineering measures and vegetation restoration on flow sediment relationships need further study this is important for sustainable ecosystem restoration and water resources planning and management within the lp and it can also provide decision support for streamflow and sediment regulation of the yr this study chose fourteen main catchments in the middle part of the lp which were the major sediment sources of yr to extract the temporal spatial patterns of flow sediment relationships during 1950s 2014 the specific objectives of this study therefore are to 1 investigate the variations of flow sediment relationships on the annual monthly and daily scales 2 detect changes of flow sediment relationships over the entire period and 3 quantify the effects of swcms and gfg project on changes of flow sediment relationships 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is located in the middle of lp between the toudaoguai to longmen hydrological stations in the mainstream of the yr fig 1 this area is usually referred to as the coarse sandy hilly catchments cshc region the main stream that flows through the cshc region is 733 km long and covers an area of 12 97 104 km2 accounting for 14 8 of the entire yr basin most of the sediment yield of the lp is produced in the cshs region which supplies over 70 of total sediment load in the yr especially coarse sand rustomji et al 2008 the cshc region was the focus of our efforts to investigate the variation of sediment load and flow sediment relationships in the lp the cshc region experiences arid to semi arid climate conditions the annual precipitation in the cshc region during 1956 2014 is 443 mm on average and varied from 580 mm in the southeast to lower than 300 mm in the northwest mcvicar et al 2007 the precipitation that occurs during the flood season june september usually takes the form of high intensity rainstorms and accounts for 72 of the annual rainfall total correspondingly about 45 of the annual runoff and 88 of the annual sediment yield within the cshc region are generated during the flood season especially due to a small number of intensive rainstorms sui et al 2009 the northwestern part of the cshc is relatively flat while the southeastern part is characterized by a more finely dissected landscape rustomji et al 2008 fourteen main catchments along the north south transect within the cshc study area were selected for study fig 1 these catchments account for 57 4 of the cshc area and contribute about 69 and 71 of streamflow and sediment load of the overall cshc respectively based on observed hydrological data during 1956 2014 characteristics of these catchments are shown in table 1 2 2 data monthly streamflow and sediment load data of the fourteen catchments and the whole cshc region differences of value between the toudaoguai and longmen gauging station during 1956 2014 were obtained from the bureau of hydrology yellow river conservancy commission of china daily streamflow and sediment load data were available for nine catchments catchments 3 9 11 and 13 daily rainfall data from 1956 to 2014 at 66 meteorological stations in and around the cshc region were provided by the national meteorological information center of china the rainfall data were spatially averaged across the study area using the co kriging interpolation algorithm and arcgis software which took a digital elevation model dem as an additional input with the hydro meteorological data including p mm streamflow q mm and sediment load s t specific sediment yield defined as ssy s a t km 2 where a is the drainage area of the hydrological station km2 and suspended sediment concentration defined as ssc s q a kg m 3 were estimated for each catchment 2 3 methods 2 3 1 trend test the significance of the trends in annual meteorological and hydrological time series was estimated by the non parametric mann kendall m k test mann 1945 kendall 1975 a precondition for using the mk test is that the series are independent in fact climatic and hydrological series may generally display serial correlation which can complicate the identification of trends in this study the trend tree pre whitening tfpw method of yue and wang 2002 was used to remove the auto correlations before executing the trend analysis there was no residual autocorrelation remaining after performing the tfpw a z statistic was obtained from the m k test on the whitened series with the tfpw method a negative value of z indicates a downward trend and vice versa the slope of the trend was estimated as follows sen 1968 hirsch et al 1982 1 β median x j x i j i for all i j where β is the magnitude of the trend and xi and xj are the sequential data values in periods i and j respectively 2 3 2 flow sediment relationships analysis the flow sediment relationship was investigated on annual monthly and daily scales as nearly all the sediment load occurred from may to october and there was no sediment load observation in some months during november to april in some catchments the monthly values from may to october only were used in analyzing monthly flow sediment relationship to make results comparable the proportional linear power and logarithmic functions were used in the regression analysis to detect the best fit ssy q relationships on annual and monthly scales of the fourteen catchments the daily flow sediment relationships were analyzed for the nine catchments with the available daily streamflow and sediment load data the sediment rating curve was used to investigate the relationship between daily ssc and streamflow discharge q that can be generally represented by warrick 2015 2 ssc m q n where m and n are the intercept and slope parameters in the rating curves determined by regression analysis using obtained data respectively the rating exponent n is the slope of the line relating ssc and q in log log space and represents the strength of the power relationship log m is the vertical offset value of the rating curve where q is equivalent to unit discharge the changes of the parameters n reflect the power of the river to erode and transport sediment and those of parameters m represent alteration of the erodibility and or supply of sediment in the watershed gao et al 2013a warrick 2015 in this study the annual monthly and daily flow sediment relationships were derived at three stages during the full data period of 1956 2014 the first period was considered the reference period as the effects of human activities were slight and could be ignored wang et al 2016 the reference period ended in 1969 for all the catchments except yuanyan catchment with 1967 1979 as the reference period during the second stage period 2 ending in 1999 numerous swcms were implemented during the third stage period 3 2000 2014 a large ecological restoration campaign gfg project was launched in 1999 3 results and discussion 3 1 changes of streamflow and sediment load fig 2 shows the changes of p q s and ssc of the cshc region during 1956 2014 the average annual value of p q s and ssc was 442 79 mm 34 42 mm 5 50 gt and 104 16 kg m3 respectively the annual q s and ssc across the cshc region showed significantly decreasing trends 0 80 mm yr 1 p 0 001 0 19 gt yr 1 p 0 001 and 1 74 kg m3 p 0 001 respectively over the past six decades whereas the decrease of annual p was not significant 1 25 mm yr 1 p 0 085 fig 2 the annual average reductions of p q s and ssc in the whole cshc region were equivalent to 0 28 2 32 3 46 and 1 67 of the corresponding mean annual values table 2 shows the trends in annual p q ssy and ssc of the fourteen catchments during 1956 2014 the annual p showed a decreasing trend in all catchments but the trend was significant in only the xinshui and zhouchuan catchments p 0 05 the annual q ssy and ssc showed significant decreasing trends in all the catchments and most of the decreases were at the 0 001 significance level especially for annual ssy and ssc for the fourteen catchments the average decrease rates of annual values of q ssy and ssc were 0 55 mm yr 1 0 15 0 98 mm yr 1 176 68 t km 2 yr 1 29 20 350 81 t km 2 yr 1 and 3 93 kg m 3 yr 1 1 61 5 67 kg m 3 yr 1 respectively compared to the reference period the mean annual precipitation decreased by 13 02 4 83 17 28 and 12 21 3 86 16 23 on average in period 2 and period 3 respectively from period 2 to period 3 the change of mean annual precipitation was slight increased by 0 95 on average with a decrease of 0 38 3 29 in five catchments and an increase in the remaining catchments 0 03 4 54 in contrast to annual p the reductions of mean annual q ssy and ssc were clearly more evident table 3 with respect to the reference period the reduction was 35 01 8 53 53 26 48 07 29 08 66 74 and 24 13 1 48 to 42 65 for q ssy and ssc during period 2 and the decreasing rate was even more in period 3 with values of 62 54 20 73 84 29 86 29 52 75 98 17 and 70 61 43 77 90 04 respectively from period 2 to period 3 the q ssy and ssc decreased by 43 64 74 47 and 61 40 on average respectively 3 2 annual and monthly flow sediment relationship the regression analysis indicated that the linear function was the best one to describe the annual ssy q relationships and the spatial distribution of r 2 values and slope of the linear equations are shown in fig 3 the performance of the linear function was good during the reference period and period 2 but the scatter was considerable in period 3 during the reference period the r 2 values of the regression were greater than 0 90 in eight catchments and the r 2 value of three catchments had the range of 0 80 r 2 0 90 and the other three had the range of 0 70 r 2 0 80 fig 3a during period 2 the performance of linear regression somewhat decreased with r 2 value greater than 0 80 in eight catchments and the remaining six catchments had r 2 value between 0 60 and 0 80 fig 3b compared to reference period and period 2 the annual ssy q relationships in period 3 became much weaker which could not be described by a clear functional relationship including the linear equation with r 2 value less than 0 60 in ten catchments fig 3c furthermore the slope of the linear regression equations decreased during period 2 and period 3 compared to that in the reference period and the decrease was considerable during period 3 fig 3 this result indicated that the sediment production capability of streamflow reduced greatly during period 3 the annual flow sediment relationship varied from catchment to catchment and showed a spatial pattern fig 3 based on the slopes of the regression equations between annual streamflow and sediment yield during the reference period the 14 catchments were classified into four groups group 1 0 04 a 0 06 group 2 0 03 a 0 04 group 3 0 02 a 0 03 group 4 a 0 02 which indicated that the sediment production capability of annual streamflow was different among the catchments fig 3a there were six five two and one catchments in group 1 group 2 group 3 and group 4 respectively the spatial patterns of the annual flow sediment relationship during period 2 were similar to that during reference period fig 3a and b during period 3 the spatial patterns of the annual flow sediment relationship were clearly different from those during the reference period and period 2 compare fig 3c against fig 3a and b there were three groups with four catchments in group 3 nine catchments in group 4 and only one catchment in group 1 the monthly ssy q showed similar spatio temporal patterns of linear relationships as those on annual scale fig 4 the annual and monthly ssy q relationships during the three stages in the yanhe catchment were plotted in fig 5 as an example the linear regression lines during period 2 were slightly located below those during the reference period and the lines during period 3 with much decreased r 2 values 0 60 were evidently situated below the lines during reference period and period 2 with r 2 values larger than 0 80 fig 5 which suggest the evolution of the annual and monthly ssy q relationships as indicated before the above results indicated that annual or monthly ssy could be predicted by q with the linear function during reference period and period 2 whereas it lost predictive power in period 3 fig 6 shows the change in annual ssy δssya versus change in q δqa and change in annual ssc δssca between two compared periods for the fourteen catchments it can be seen that the δssya and δssca between the reference period and period 3 p3 p1 or that between period 2 and period 3 p3 p2 were greater than those between the reference period and period 2 p2 p1 the δssya was significantly linearly related with δqa with r 2 value greater than 0 60 and p value less than 0 001 fig 6a furthermore the regression line of changes between reference period and period 1 were situated below the lines of changes of reference period vs period 3 or period 2 vs period 3 this result indicates that a specified reduction in qa from the reference period to period 3 or from period 2 to period 3 can lead to a larger decrease of ssya with respect to that from reference period to period 2 the δssya was also linearly related with δssca but the relationship was weaker than that between δssya and δqa as indicated by the lower r 2 value and larger p value fig 6b especially the δssya was not significantly correlated with the δssca between the reference period and period 3 p 0 104 the above results indicated that the decrease of ssya was dominated by reduction in qa whereas the reduction in δssca explained only partly the decrease of ssya 3 3 daily flow sediment relationship the sediment rating curves between daily ssc and q during three stages for the nine catchments are shown in table 4 and the curves in a log log diagram of the yanhe catchment are plotted in fig 7 as an example as shown in fig 7 daily ssc and q were positively related and each varied by several orders of magnitude at moderate streamflow discharge 100 102 m3 s the variability in ssc was highest with a span of 3 4 orders of magnitude at higher streamflows 102 m3 s the ssc is distributed within the range of 102 103 kg m3 and approached a certain plateau the power law function was satisfactory to describe the sediment rating curves during the reference period with most of the r 2 value greater than 0 50 and the performance decreased somewhat during period 2 table 4 however the ssc under high flow conditions was overestimated by the power law function and the daily ssc q relationship showed considerable scatter during period 3 which could not be captured by the sediment rating curve furthermore the slope of sediment rating curve n decreased in period 2 and period 3 with respect to reference period especially during period 3 associated with considerable decrease of n for most of the catchments table 4 this result indicated that the transport capacity of runoff decreased and the sensitivity of sediment concentration to discharge has been on a decreasing trend in contrast to n the changes of parameter m in the sediment rating curve were complex in some catchments m decreased whereas it increased in other catchments from the reference period to period 3 table 4 the daily flow sediment relationship also showed somewhat spatial pattern with the spatial variability of parameter n during the reference period and period 2 the n values of kuye 3 and xinshui 13 catchments were much lower than those of other catchments the spatial pattern of n changed greatly in period 3 compared to reference period and period 2 during period 3 the n values in the 14 catchments could be divided into three groups with catchments 7 8 and 11 in group 1 1 50 n 1 80 catchments 6 9 and 13 in group 2 1 20 n 1 30 and catchments 3 4 and 5 in group 3 0 60 n 0 90 to further investigate the daily flow sediment relationship the mean daily ssc under different flow conditions among the three stages was compared in fig 8 four flow conditions were classified including extreme high 0 10 high 10 25 moderate 25 75 and low flow 75 compared to the reference period the mean daily ssc under extreme high high moderate and low flow conditions decreased by 21 04 51 18 52 68 and 45 93 on average in period 2 and the reduction was even more in period 3 with values of 67 36 85 51 87 18 and 76 94 respectively from period 2 to period 3 the reduction of mean daily ssc under the four flow conditions was 58 24 69 55 72 44 and 54 58 respectively the above results indicated that the sediment production ability under different flow conditions decreased from reference period to period 2 and from period 2 to period 3 3 4 effects of land use cover change on sediment concentration in order to quantify the effects of swcm on flow sediment relationships the relationships between the decadal sediment concentration and the fraction of area treated with erosion control measures in the 14 catchments were analysed and the results are presented in table 5 the decadal sediment concentration ssc decreased linearly with the fraction of treated land surface area a swcm in all catchments 3 ssc k a swcm l the correlations were significant in eleven catchments p 0 05 with r 2 ranging from 0 62 to 0 95 table 5 the effects of swcm on sediment concentration change show a spatial pattern based on the slope of the regression equation between the sediment concentration and fraction of the treated area the catchments were classified into four groups in fig 9 group 1 2 0 k 3 0 group 2 3 0 k 4 0 group 3 4 0 k 5 0 and group 4 6 0 k 8 0 there were four three four and three catchments in group 1 group 2 group 3 and group 4 respectively this indicated that the degree of sediment load impacted by conservation measures was different among the catchments 3 5 discussion this study indicated that the flow sediment relationships were significantly different before 2000 and after 2000 in the location of study before 2000 i e during reference period and period 2 the annual and monthly flow sediment relationships could be generally characterized by linear functions and the power law sediment rating curve could be used to describe the daily flow sediment relationship during the reference period there was minimal lucc and the streamflow and sediment yield were mainly controlled by precipitation gao et al 2016 2017a during period 2 numerous swcms were implemented the engineering measures especially check dams had immediate and substantial effects on reducing stremflow and sediment load and both of them were retained within the catchment rustomji et al 2008 the reduction of sediment yield during period 2 was mainly caused by decrease of streamflow zhang et al 2017a therefore there was a little change in sediment yield under certain streamflow and flow sediment relationships between reference period and period 2 as evident from fig 5 as vegetation restoration campaign took effect since 2000 the flow sediment relationships became much weaker and the flow sediment relationship functions during reference period and period 2 lost any predictive power establishing perennial vegetation cover was considered one of the most effective measures to stabilize soils and minimize erosion farley et al 2005 liu et al 2014 the substantially improved vegetation cover in the lp greatly decreased the sediment production ability of streamflow the reduction of sediment load caused by vegetation restoration was greater than that of streamflow as evident from table 3 this was due to vegetation restoration that could contribute to an increase of baseflow zheng 2015 wang et al 2016 therefore the flow sediment relationships during period 3 were uncertain which was difficult to be predicted by clear functional relationships the flow sediment relationships changed over stages and they also depended on time scales annual monthly and daily the annual or monthly flow sediment relationships could be described well by linear functions whereas the daily flow sediment relationship was described by a power law sediment rating curve which exhibited scatter at high flows the time dependence of flow sediment relationships was mainly due to the nonlinear and intermittent runoff sediment generation processes especially on fine scale vercruysse et al 2017 there was certain lag effect of sediment export with respect to streamflow in the catchment which was more evident in larger catchment the lag effect could be reduced on coarse time scales resulting in the explicit annual and monthly flow relationships whereas the daily flow sediment relationships were more uncertain and the scatter about the sediment rating curve increased with increasing flow gao et al 2013a in this case the nonlinear and preferably nonparametric fitting approach such as lowess locally weighted scatterplot smoothing fitting techniques should be considered especially for situations in which a curvature existed between the discharge and sediment concentration data at high flows as shown in fig 7 warrick et al 2013 zhang et al 2017b the connections of flow sediment relationships across multiple timescales need further detailed study given the considerable effects of climate change and human activities besides the above temporal variations over different stages and across different timescales the flow sediment relationships also showed spatial pattern from figs 3 and 4 it could be found that the sediment production capability by streamflow in the catchments of the northwestern part was greater than that in the southeastern part the effects of swcms on sediment concentration reduction were greater in the northwestern part compared to those in the southeastern part fig 9 the spatial pattern of the flow sediment relationships mainly depended on the landscape properties among catchments including vegetation cover topography soil properties as well as precipitation characteristics the catchments in the northwestern part had low leaf area index lai compared to those in the southeastern part gao et al 2017a the lower vegetation cover was the main reason for the greater effects of streamflow on sediment yield and stronger flow sediment relationships in the northwestern part in order to fully explore this the mapping of information of catchment characteristics into runoff and sediment yield models and simulation under different land surface and climate scenarios would be needed the temporal spatial variations of flow sediment relationships were mainly caused by the extensive lucc the increase in forestland of the study area was 12 44 and the change in cropland only 0 05 was negligible from 1975 to 2000 and the increase of lai 0 003 yr 1 p 0 11 was not significant during 1982 1999 gao et al 2017a in contrast the percentage of swcms increased greatly from 1 72 in the 1950s to 17 39 in the 1990s yao et al 2011 it is generally accepted that the sediment load reductions before 2000 were primarily caused by the implementation of swcms after 2000 cropland decreased greatly 26 69 and forestland increased greatly 36 20 induced by the gfg or reforestation project and lai increased significantly during 2000 2011 0 024 yr 1 p 0 01 gao et al 2017a the combined effects of substantial vegetation cover and engineering measures weakened the effects of streamflow on sediment yield and made the flow sediment relationships uncertain although the engineering measures especially the check dams utilized much smaller area compared to the biotic treatments they substantially trapped streamflow and sediment load the check dam is an effective sedimentation mitigation and sediment could be fully deposited before the dam it was reported that the check dam sedimentation storage in the lp was 230 108 m3 510 108 m3 650 108 m3 and 700 108 m3 in the 1980s 1990s 2000s and 2010s respectively yao et al 2011 however the effectiveness of engineering measures decreased over time as they were progressively filled with sediments and subsequently destroyed by floods vegetation restoration would play a greater role in regulating the variability of flow sediment relationships and controlling soil erosion it should be noted that much of the sediment yield in the lp may be caused during only a few major storms rustomji et al 2008 the inter annual and intra annual patterns of variability of precipitation including the distribution of storm events may also contributed to the observed temporal spatial variations of flow sediment relationships in recent years the rainstorm events in the lp increased and it had a significant effect on the soil erosion and changed the flow sediment relationship further concern should be paid on the flood runoff and sediment exploration of the detailed effects of lucc and precipitation variability on flow sediment relationships will require a more physically based model that can account for fine scale catchment characteristics and rainfall variability 4 conclusions this study investigated the multiscale annual monthly and daily variability of flow sediment relationships over different periods during 1950s 2014 in 14 main catchments of the loess plateau in china during the reference period 1950s 1969 with minimal lucc and period 2 1970 1999 with numerous ecological measures implemented the annual and monthly flow sediment relationships could be well described by linear functions and the power law sediment rating curve was able to describe the daily flow sediment relationship in spite of some scatter under high flow there were no considerable differences in flow sediment relationships between reference period and period 2 during period 3 as vegetation restoration campaign took effect since 2000 the flow sediment relationships became much weaker which could not be predicted by the functions established during the reference period and period 2 or any other relationships the effects of lucc on the variability of flow sediment relationships were quantified through the controls on sediment concentration the mean daily sediment concentration under different flow conditions decreased greatly the sediment concentration was heavily dependent on the area under land use cover treatment exhibiting a linear decreasing relationship with considerable variation in slope among the 14 catchments it can thus be concluded that the flow sediment relationships revealed both time dependence and systematic spatial pattern and it appears that the variability of flow sediment relationships was mainly regulated by the vegetation restoration measures acknowledgements this research was funded by the national key

7162,the linearized parabolic approximation of the saint venant equations is often used for flood routing but the corresponding analytic solutions usually neglect the downstream boundary conditions this is an issue because the presence of hydraulic structures at the end of a river reach or natural morphologic conditions may influence the wave propagation in order to take into account realistic boundary conditions namely a stage hydrograph upstream and a stage discharge relationship downstream a new set of exact solutions of the linearized parabolic approximation of the saint venant equations with uniformly distributed lateral inflows is presented this exact solution is demonstrated by using it as a building block in a simplified flood routing model whose numerical results are compared with those supplied by laboratory experiments from literature finally the new solutions are used to analyze the range of validity of semi infinite channel models the comparison shows that semi infinite channel models are accurate when convective effects are prevailing on diffusive effects and the downstream boundary condition corresponds to uniform flow conditions in addition the results show that semi infinite channel models based on the knowledge of the upstream stage hydrograph can predict flow depths better than those making use of a flow hydrograph while being practically equivalent in predicting flow rates keywords diffusive wave analytical solution backwater effects boundary conditions channel routing simplified model 1 introduction the saint venant equations sves are commonly used for the description of one dimensional unsteady flow in rivers or artificial channel networks cunge et al 1980 the exact solution of the sves is available for schematic cases only and appropriate numerical methods such as the finite difference method vukovic and sopta 2003 xing and shu 2006 the finite element method szymkiewicz 1991 and the finite volume method garcia navarro and vazquez cendon 2001 liang and marche 2009 cozzolino et al 2012 can be used for real world applications despite the availability of reliable numerical procedures the application of the full one dimensional saint venant numerical models may suffer from a number of drawbacks such as the lack of cross section topographic data obtained by traditional ground or lidar surveys hutton et al 2012 the incorrect application of internal and external boundary conditions cunge et al 1980 sobey 2001 the arbitrariness in the choice of cross sections location and orientation and the uncertainties of the friction coefficients hunter et al 2007 these practical issues may overshadow the advantage of an accurate physical representation in addition the courant friedrichs lewy restriction of the time step in explicit time marching numerical models murillo et al 2006 may advice against the use of the sves in the case of forecasting applications control problems and design applications involving monte carlo approaches neal et al 2012 to overcome these drawbacks simplified models are considered an attractive alternative to fully dynamic models hunter et al 2007 bates et al 2010 cheviron and moussa

emmanuel et al 2015 the main advantage of analytical solutions is the unconditional stability of the associated numerical models thus allowing for long time steps especially when accuracy is not an issue wang et al 2014 interestingly the lpa is related to other widely used simplified models such as the muskingum cunge mc model cunge 1969 weinmann and laurenson 1979 that can be transformed into an equivalent lpa by matching physical and numerical diffusion cunge 1969 even though it was originally derived from the kinematic wave simplification of the sves in the literature many efforts have been spent to develop simplified stage hydrograph routing models because upstream gauge information is usually available in the form of stage hydrographs this is also convenient because upstream flow hydrograph boundary conditions require the evaluation of the rating curve which is often lacking or inaccurate spada et al 2017 following this approach physically based stage hydrograph models such has the variable parameter muskingum stage hydrograph are now available perumal and ranga raju 1998a b perumal et al 2007 2009 2010a b unfortunately the analytic solutions of the lpa with stage hydrograph imposed upstream do not take into account downstream boundary conditions see the review in cimorelli et al 2014 and the semi infinite channel analytic solution by hayami 1951 is usually assumed in practical applications the only exception is the model by tingsanchali and manandhar 1985 whose applicability is limited because it is based on the knowledge of the downstream stage hydrograph as pointed out by numerous authors chung et al 1993 munier et al 2008 cimorelli et al 2014 2015 cozzolino et al 2014 structures or channel geometric singularities weirs sluice gates bridge piles which influence the stage discharge relationship downstream may significantly affect the flow dynamics this makes the semi infinite channel solution by hayami 1951 inadequate in many cases therefore it is clear that the construction of the lpa analytic solution in finite length channels with stage hydrograph upstream boundary condition and given rating curve imposed downstream is an attractive task following the approach used in cimorelli et al 2014 for the case of discharge hydrograph upstream boundary conditions this analytical solution is supplied in the present work by applying the laplace transform technique the findings are compared with the experimental results of a laboratory test showing the suitability of the finite length channel analytical solution in simplified flow routing models only the flow depth response of the semi infinite channel lpa with stage hydrograph imposed upstream with lateral inflow is available in the literature hayami 1951 for this reason this solution is complemented in the present work by the corresponding discharge response to the stage hydrograph imposed upstream with lateral inflow this allows the comparison with the new finite length channel solution in order to evaluate the applicability limits of the hayami 1951 solution the results of this comparison are of interest not only for the lpa based flow routing models but also for those mc models perumal and ranga raju 1998a b perumal et al 2007 2009 2010a b where a stage hydrograph is considered upstream the paper is organized as follows in section 2 the novel finite length channel analytical solutions are presented in section 3 the complete semi infinite channel solution is derived for upstream stage hydrograph and lateral inflow in section 4 the finite length and the semi infinite channel analytical solutions are compared by considering the results of a laboratory experiment from the literature in section 5 the applicability limits of the semi infinite channel solution is accomplished by comparing its unit step response with that of the finite length channel finally the conclusions are drawn in section 6 2 finite length channel analytical solution with stage hydrograph imposed upstream in the present section the lpa model is presented and the corresponding analytic solution in finite length channels with stage hydrograph upstream boundary condition and given rating curve imposed downstream is derived 2 1 lpa governing equations the parabolic approximation pa of the saint venant equations for a prismatic channel can be written as cunge et al 1980 1 q x b h t q h x s 0 s f 0 where q x t is the discharge h x t is the flow depth b x h is the channel width s 0 x is the bed slope and s f q h x is the friction slope if eq 1 is linearized around a uniform state characterized by flow depth hr discharge qr and width b r the linearized parabolic approximation lpa is obtained with reference to a channel of length l the dimensionless form of the lpa model is cimorelli et al 2014 2015 2 q x β h t q h x r 1 q r 2 h 0 where 3 t t c r l x x l h h h r q q q r q ql q r are the dimensionless expressions of the time variable

the pèclet number 6 p e c r l d r which expresses the relative importance of flow advection and diffusion it is easy to see from 4 and 5 that pe β r1 2 2 finite length channel general solution in the laplace domain the laplace transform of eq 2 is 7 q x β s h β h 0 q h x r 1 q r 2 h 0 where s is the complex laplace variable q x s h x s and q x s are the laplace transforms of q x t h x t and q x t respectively while h 0 x h x 0 is the initial condition of the first order flow depth increment under the assumption that the lateral inflow is uniform in space and the initial condition h 0 x is null the general solution of eq 7 is cimorelli et al 2014 8 q x s h x s γ x s q 0 s h 0 s γ x s q s where q x s h x s t is the frequency domain solution vector q 0 s h 0 s t is the frequency domain upstream boundary condition vector and q s q x s in eq 8 the matrix 9 γ x s γ 11 x s γ 12 x s γ 21 x s γ 22 x s is the state transition matrix while γ x s γ 11 x s γ 21 x s t is a vector taking into account the lateral inflow contribution the expressions of γ x s and γ x s are deduced in cimorelli et al 2014 and are reported in the appendix a of the present work for the reader s ease the eq 8 represents the laplace domain general solution of eq 7 and it must be complemented with the correct boundary conditions and lateral inflows to obtain the desired particular solutions 2 3 particular solutions with upstream stage hydrograph and downstream stage discharge function a stage hydrograph h 0 t is assumed as upstream boundary condition while the stage discharge relationship q l t f sg h l t is assumed downstream in order to derive the analytical solution of eq 7 the linearized dimensionless expressions of these boundary conditions are needed upstream the first order increment h 0 t h 0 t h r of the stage hydrograph function is considered and the corresponding dimensionless form h 0 t h 0 t h r is immediately obtained downstream the stage discharge relationship is linearized around the flow depth hr and is then reduced in dimensionless form the corresponding expression is 10 q 1 t β α h 1 t where the dimensionless abscissa x 1 corresponds to x l the parameter α b r c r k where k d f sg h r dh quantifies how much the downstream boundary conditions deviates from the steady uniform flow along the channel the laplace transform of eq 10 finally leads to the laplace domain downstream boundary condition 11 q 1 t β α h 1 t the substitution of eq 11 into eq 8 for x 1 supplies 12 q 0 s γ 12 1 s β α 1 γ 22 1 s γ 11 1 s β α 1 γ 21 1 s h 0 s γ 11 1 s β α 1 γ 21 1 s γ 11 1 s β α 1 γ 21 1 s q s the eq 12 represents the unique relationship between upstream flow depth and upstream discharge that is compatible in a finite length channel where eq 11 describes the downstream boundary condition the substitution of eq 12 into the first of eq 8 allows to eliminate q 0 s leading to the flow depth response of a finite length channel to a stage hydrograph imposed upstream with lateral inflow contribution 13 h x s w u x s h 0 s w l x s q s in eq 13 the function w u x s represents the flow depth laplace domain response to an upstream stage hydrograph unit pulse while w l x s represents the flow depth laplace domain response to a lateral inflow unit pulse these functions are defined as 14 w u x s e p e x 2 p e 2 α sinh 1 x 2 z α z cosh 1 x 2 z p e 2 α sinh 1 2 z α z cosh 1

contribution 16 q x s y u x s h 0 s y l x s q s in eq 16 y u x s is the laplace domain discharge response to an upstream stage hydrograph unit pulse while y l x s is the response corresponding to a

technique used to obtain the coefficients c i n x i 1 4 n 0 1 2 and to calculate the poles is described in appendix b the unit step response frequently used to discretize inputs of any shape by means of rectangles chow et al 1988 wang et al 2014 is defined as the primitive of the unit pulse response therefore the laplace transform inversion theorem ahlfors 1979 can be used to show that the unit step responses corresponding to the unit pulse responses of eqs 19 22 are 23 w u x t 0 t w u x τ d τ e p e α 1 e p e x e p e α 1 n 0 c 1 n x s n exp s n t 24 w l x t 0 t w l x τ d τ x β e p e x 1 β p

the eqs 23 and 25 represent the flow depth and the discharge response respectively to the stage hydrograph unit step input at the upstream end of the channel similarly eqs 24 and 26 represent the flow depth and the discharge response respectively to the lateral inflow unit step input when the upstream flow depth is given the eqs 23 26 are valid under the condition α 2 if α 2 the hyperbolic sines at the denominators of eqs 14 15 and 17 18 vanish and the time domain solutions are simplified see appendix b remark 1 it is important to note that the eqs 24 and 26 differ from the eqs 38 and 36 in cimorelli et al 2014 that represent the flow depth and discharge response respectively to the lateral inflow unit step input when the upstream discharge is given the expressions of eqs 23 26 are totally new 3 analytical solution in semi infinite channel with stage hydrograph imposed upstream the flow depth response of eq 7 is already known in the semi infinite channel when a stage hydrograph is imposed upstream hayami 1951 in particular the function 27 w u x t 1 2 e r f c x t 4 t p e 1 2 e p e x e r f c x t 4 t p e represents the flow depth response to the upstream stage hydrograph unit step input the corresponding discharge response is not available in the literature and it is derived in the present section first the linearized parabolic rating curve is obtained from the second of eq 2 28 q β h β p e h x if the position h x t w u x t is made in eq 27 and the eq 27 is substituted in eq 28 the expression 29 y u x t β 2 e r f c x t 4 t p e β π p e t e x t 2 4 t p e is obtained after the position y u x t q x t the eq 29 represents the discharge response to the stage hydrograph unit step imposed upstream the substitution of the second of eq 7 into the first supplies the following flow depth advection diffusion equation hayami 1951 30 1 p e 2 h x 2 h x h t q which formally coincides with the discharge advection diffusion equation ade by cunge 1969 for this reason the solutions of eq 30 can be borrowed from the solutions of the discharge ade form if the analytic derivation contained in franchini and todini 1988 is applied to eq 30 it can be shown that the function 31 w l x t t 1 2 t x e r f c x t 4 t p e 1 2 t x e p e x e r f c x t 4 t p e is the flow depth response to the uniform lateral inflow unit step input in the semi infinite channel for given flow depth imposed upstream if the position h x t w l x t is made in eq 31 the substitution in eq 28 supplies the expression 32 y l x t β t π p e e x t 2 4 t p e β t β 2 t x 1 2 p e e r f c x t 4 t p e β 2 p e t x e p e x e r f c x t 4 t p e which represents the discharge response to the unit step uniform lateral inflow in the semi infinite channel for given flow depth imposed upstream remark 2 the discharge responses of eqs 29 and 32 are novel and complement the flow depth responses of eqs 27 and 31 which are already available in the literature 4 numeric application of the finite length and semi infinite channel analytical solutions a simple linear flood routing model based on the analytic findings of the preceding sections is here presented the flood routing model is then used to reproduce the results of a laboratory test case from the literature 4 1 a simple linear flood routing model in the case of uniform linear channel a simplified version of the iltdfr model cimorelli et al 2015 can be used to route a stage hydrograph imposed upstream let i t h 0 t h 0 t h r h r be the dimensionless stage hydrograph at the inlet of the channel this function is represented by the sequence of rectangular pulses 33 i k 1 δ t k 1 δ t k δ t i τ d τ k 1 2 where δ t is the dimensionless time interval the flow depth response of the channel at the station x and time t n n δ t n 1 2 is immediately calculated as 34 h x t n k 1 n i k w x n k 1 δ t w x n k δ t where w x t w u x t when the downstream boundary condition is taken into account while w x t w u x t whether the effect of the downstream boundary condition is neglected semi infinite channel 4 2 numeric application the linear model of eq 33 is applied to the experimental results by rashid and chaudhry 1995 the original experimental setup consisted of a flume lf 21 m long with uniform longitudinal bed slope compound rectangular cross section rectangular main channel with rectangular floodplains and manning s roughness coefficient dependent on the flow depth an inclined sluice gate with bed sill was present at the downstream end of the laboratory flume and the corresponding stage discharge relation was expressed by 35 f sg h c h a m where a is the sill height in eq 35 the constants c 9 35 and m 1 14 were experimentally determined by rashid and chaudhry 1995 nine gauging stations were located at different distances from the flume inlet table 1 and the actual channel length used in the computations is l 18 6 m because the upstream boundary condition is given by the flow depth record at the gauging station 1 the geometric characteristics of the flume and the initial conditions of the experiments are reported in rashid and chaudhry 1995 and their complete description is not repeated here first the model of eq 33 is applied with w x t w u x t finite length channel model to the test 1 where the flow occupies the entire compound cross section the parameters pe α and β needed for the calculation of the finite length channel response function w u x t of eq 25 are evaluated with respect to the initial condition of test 1 and no calibration is performed in particular hr is computed as the average value of the initial backwater profile qr is set equal to the initial discharge and the reference conditions used for the downstream boundary conditions are those corresponding to the reference discharge qr the results of the simulation with time step δt 10 s thin continuous line are compared in fig 1 with the experimental results circles from the figure it is evident that the uniform linear channel model reproduces nicely the flow depth hydrograph at the gauging station 2 fig 1a which is close to the inlet while the essentials of the flow propagation phenomenon are captured at the gauging station 5 fig 1b located at the middle of the channel it is very important to observe that better results could be obtained if a cascade of uniform diffusive channels were used after a calibration of the parameters cimorelli et al 2015 in fig 1 the results of a full saint venant finite difference model by rashid and chaudhry 1995 are also reported the comparison with the experimental results shows that the parabolic linear model does not behave worse than the full saint venant equations for this test case the discrepancy between the experimental results and the numerical results at the gauging station 5 can be explained recalling that the cross section is compound with initial conditions corresponding to more than 0 20 m of flow depth in the main channel and less of 0 01 m of flow depth over the lateral floodplains the finite length model is then applied to the test 2 where the flow is entirely contained into the main rectangular channel the close inspection of fig 2 shows that the uniform linear channel model reproduces nicely the flow depth hydrograph at both the gauging stations 2 fig 2a and 5 fig 2b the improvement of the numerical results can be explained recalling that now the wetted area corresponds to a compact cross section in the same figure the results of the numerical model by rashid and chaudhry 1995 are also reported again the comparison shows that the results supplied by the finite length linear model are of comparable quality to those supplied by the full saint venant model tests 1 and 2 are repeated considering the semi infinite channel model w x t w u x t in eq 33 the results are represented in figs 1 and 2 respectively with symbol the comparison with the experimental results clearly shows that the semi infinite channel model behaves worse than the finite length model 5 comparison between semi infinite channel and finite length channel analytical solutions the findings of the previous section suggest that the finite length channel analytical solutions are more accurate than the semi infinite channel analytical solutions in reproducing real flows therefore the applicability of the semi infinite channel solutions is discussed by comparison with the corresponding finite length channel solutions the analysis is accomplished considering the unit step responses because these functions are used as a building block in practical numerical methods where input hydrographs are represented by means of rectangular pulses sequences todini and bossi 1986 chow et al 1988 cimorelli et al 2013b 2015 2016 wang et al 2014 values of pe and α representative of realistic situations are considered while the constant β 1 is taken as this coefficient is just a scaling factor first the dependence of the flow depth responses on pe and α is commented and finally the nash sutcliffe efficiency index is used for an objective comparison 5 1 flow depth response to a unit step stage hydrograph imposed upstream the eqs 23 and 27 represent the flow depth responses of finite length and semi infinite channels respectively to a unit step stage hydrograph imposed upstream the functions are plotted in the plane t h of fig 3 for different values of the parameters pe 0 5 2 5 and 5 and α 0 5 1 and 1 5 and at different locations x 0 2 0 4 0 6 0 8 1 a continuous line is used for the finite length channel response while a dashed line is used for the finite length channel response first the finite length channel flow depth response h w u x t of eq 23 is considered the value α 0 5 panels in the left column of fig 3 is representative of a downstream boundary condition where a free fall or a critical flow depth occurs at the downstream end congruently with the physical meaning of the downstream boundary condition the flow depth decreases with x at a given t for every value of pe for α 1 panels in the central column of fig 3 as time increases the flow depth tends asymptotically to h 1 everywhere this behavior is consistent with α 1 being representative of a normal depth downstream boundary condition the value α 1 5 panels in the right column of fig 3 is representative of an obstacle downstream such as a sluice gate or a weir in this case the eq 23 exhibits a noticeable backwater effect propagating from downstream with increasing t correspondingly h w u x t has a twisted behavior because the flow depth decreases with x for smaller values of t when the wave entering upstream has not reached the downstream boundary condition and increases with x for greater values of t because the wave is reflecting at the downstream boundary conditions the response h w u x t of eq 30 depends on pe only and not on α for this reason the corresponding plots in the left column of fig 3 are equal to those of the central and the right column and no twisted behavior is exhibited a closer inspection shows that lower values of pe cause a faster growth of h w u x t but the asymptotic value of h obtained for increasing t is not affected in addition h decreases with x at a given time t 5 2 flow depth response to a unit step uniformly distributed lateral inflow the functions h w l x t of eq 24 and h w l x t of eq 31 are plotted in the plane t h of fig 4 with the same parameters pe α and x used for fig 3 the finite length channel response to the lateral inflow is quite different from the response to the upstream stage hydrograph when a 0 5 free fall condition at the downstream end the time asymptotic flow depth value of h w l x t increases from x 0 to a maximum in x 0 8 and then decreases from x 0 8 to x 1 this differs from the case of h w u x t in fig 3 where the flow depth is always decreasing when α 1 uniform flow at the downstream end the time asymptotic value of h w l x t increases along the channel while h w u x t exhibits the same asymptotic value h 1 at every cross section finally when α 1 5 sluice gate or weir at the downstream end h w l x t increases regularly with x at any instant t while h w u x t exhibits a twisted behavior the semi infinite channel response h w l x t can reproduce the results of eq 24 only for high values of pe and close to the upstream channel end when p e 5 the two solutions behave similarly for x from 0 2 to 0 6 and for each value of α when p e 2 5 the two solutions exhibit similar behaviors for x from 0 2 to 0 4 and for α 1 finally the plots of eqs 24 and 31 are very different at any position along the channel and for any value of α when p e 0 5 5 3 discharge response to a unit step stage hydrograph imposed upstream the functions q y u x t of eq 25 and q y u x t of eq 29 are plotted in the plane t q of fig 5 with the same parameters of figs 3 and 4 from fig 5 it is evident that the function q y u x t exhibits a peak originated at the channel inlet that moves and decays along the channel actually when the inlet flow depth h increases instantly from 0 to 1 unit step stage hydrograph the linearized looped rating curve of eq 28 prescribes that the derivative at the right hand side is a negative delta function for this reason the second term at the right hand side of eq 28 is a positive delta function that sums up with the first term a unit step for t 0 this delta function is convected and diffused along the channel while the discharge entering upstream tends to an asymptotic value that depends on h and its space derivative a closer inspection of eq 28 shows that the inlet discharge peak weakens when pe increases and vanishes when pe tends to infinity while the dependency on α of the time asymptotic discharge value decreases with pe the function q y u x t of eq 29 is inadequate to mimic the finite channel model when pe 0 5 conversely the solution is well reproduced almost everywhere along the channel with exclusion of x 1 when p e 5 finally the correspondence between eqs 25 and eq 29 is strongly influenced by α when p e 2 5 but there is a reasonable correspondence for x 0 6 5 4 discharge response to unit step lateral inflows a plot of the functions q y l x t of eq 26 and q y l x t of eq 32 is reported in fig 6 with the same parameters considered in the preceding subsections the inspection of the figure shows that the infinite length and semi infinite channel solutions exhibit negative discharges in the vicinities of x 0 for low values of pe when uniform lateral inflow is imposed this feature can be easily explained recalling that eqs 26 and 32 are found under the assumption h 0 t 0 for t 0 which allows the separation of effects from the case of a stage hydrograph boundary condition imposed upstream according to eq 28 this implies that the discharge q along the channel is negative when p e h h x this is precisely what happens for low values of pe in the vicinities of x 0 where h is small and h x 0 physically speaking the conditions in which these new solutions are derived can be representative of a water body in the upstream cross section a lake or the sea a tank served by a pump where the constant level allows the lateral discharge injected along the channel to partly flow upstream when a null or positive discharge is expected at the upstream end eqs 26 or 32 are not autonomous andmust be complemented by a proper upstream stage hydrograph interestingly this also means that the upstream stage hydrograph cannot be assigned arbitrarily if lateral inflows are present therefore when the lateral inflow is the only input the exact solution with discharge imposed upstream cimorelli et al 2014 should be preferred the fig 6 shows that the function q y l x t of eq 32 does not match the function q y l x t of eq 26 for p e 0 5 when p e 2 5 the two solutions behave qualitatively in a similar manner but there are significant differences for α 0 5 and α 1 while the differences are small for α 1 5 for p e 5 the results given by the two solutions are similar except for the location x 1 5 5 backwater effect analysis to establish the range of validity of the semi infinite channel solutions presented in section 3 the efficiency index ns by nash and sutcliffe 1970 36 ns 1 i 1 i max f t i f o t i 2 i 1 i max f o t i f o 2 is used in eq 36 f t i and f o t i are the approximating and the true function respectively evaluated at the time instant ti with i 1 2 i max while f o is the mean value of the true function the index ns ranges in 1 where ns 1 indicates a perfect match between the two models while ns 0 means that the prediction made by the approximating model has the same accuracy of the time averaged value of the true one in this subsection the values in x 1 of the semi infinite channel solutions are taken as the approximating models while the step responses of eqs 23 26 at the same abscissa are taken as the true models all the computations are performed considering p e 0 10 and a 0 3 in the following the interval ns 0 7 is considered as representative of a satisfactory matching moriasi et al 2007 the contour plot in fig 7 represents the results of eq 36 when eqs 23 and 27 are compared it is evident from the figure that there is a region p e α 1 10 0 6 1 4 where h w u x t eq 27 provides a good approximation of h w u x t eq 23 from a practical point of view this is significant because the interval 0 6 α 1 3 is wide enough to represent the downstream boundary conditions usually encountered in river applications this result is consistent with the numerical application of section 4 in experiment 1 pe 1 04 and α 0 126 while in experiment 2 pe 0 016 and α 0 0124 and in both cases the semi infinite solution failed to reproduce the numerical experiment the outcomes are quite different fig 8 when h w l x t eq 24 and h w l x t eq 31 are compared because in this case the region of validity of h w l x t is reduced to p e α 2 10 1 1 1 5 the contour plot of eq 36 computed using q y u x t eq 25 and q y u x t eq 29 is depicted in fig 9 despite the use of the flow depth as upstream boundary condition the discharge response q y u x t matches the finite length channel response q y u x t better than the flow depth response h w u x t matches the finite length model h w u x t because the area of validity starts from a point p e α 0 5 0 5 and spreads up covering the whole range of considered α at p e 2 actually the propagation of the discharge by means of semi infinite channels model seems more robust than the propagation of the flow depth which is greatly influenced by the downstream boundary condition a similar conclusion can be deduced by looking at the contour plot of fig 10 where eq 36 is calculated considering q y l x t eq 26 and q y l x t eq 32 6 discussion the exact solutions of eq 7 for the cases of finite length and semi infinite channels have been systematically compared in section 4 showing that the péclet number pe and the downstream boundary condition coefficient α are the parameters controlling the suitability of the semi infinite channel solutions the lower values of pe correspond to short channels or to cases where diffusivity effects are not negligible with respect to the convection effects conversely the higher values of pe correspond to long channels or to cases where the convection effects are predominant congruently with the physical interpretation of pe the comparison between the finite length and the semi infinite channel solutions shows that the downstream boundary conditions cannot be neglected when pe is low or α is far from 1 conversely the use of the semi infinite channel model is reliable when pe is high and α is close to 1 in addition the analysis has shown that the semi infinite channel model with flow depth imposed upstream predicts q x t better than h x t because the flow depth is more directly influenced by the downstream boundary condition but the range of validity of h x t is satisfactory for large pe these results can be compared with the findings contained in cimorelli et al 2014 where the range of validity of semi infinite channel solutions was considered when discharge was imposed upstream for that case it was concluded that the range of validity of semi infinite channel models for the prediction of h x t was very narrow while the range of validity for the prediction of q x t was larger in conclusion semi infinite channel models that use a stage hydrograph as upstream boundary condition are able to predict the flow depths better than the semi infinite channel models where the upstream flow hydrograph is routed while minor differences are found when the prediction of the discharge is considered for this reason semi infinite channel models with stage hydrograph imposed upstream should be used when an accurate prediction of the flow depth is required these conclusions are not limited to the lpa model only since the downstream boundary conditions are neglected in many of the approximate flood routing models that are used in the hydrology practice one of the most employed of these models is the mc model which is equivalent to the advection diffusion equation ade form of the lpa in semi infinite channels if its parameters are properly chosen cunge 1969 tang et al 1999 wang et al 2006 for this reason the applicability limits studied here also supply useful indications about the range of applicability of the mc model with a stage hydrograph boundary condition perumal and ranga raju 1998a b perumal et al 2007 2009 2010a b 7 conclusions a novel set of analytical solutions for the linearized parabolic approximation lpa of the sve has been derived in this paper considering a stage hydrograph upstream boundary condition uniform lateral inflows and a stage discharge relationship as downstream boundary condition these solutions are motivated by the fact that downstream boundary conditions control structures obstructions such as bridge piles sills jumps can modify significantly the flow dynamics for further comparison these analytical solutions have been complemented by the corresponding analytical solutions in the semi infinite channel the numerical results of a numerical application have suggested that a simple flood routing model equipped with the finite length channel exact solution behaves better than the semi infinite channel solution in reproducing the experimental results obtained in a laboratory channel this finding has suggested a systematic comparison of finite length and semi infinite channel analytic solutions in order to analyze the applicability of the routing models based on the semi infinite channel length assumptions from the comparison it is evident that the downstream boundary conditions can be neglected only when the péclet number is high and the downstream rating curve is not far from a normal depth one conversely the semi infinite channel models should not be used if the péclet number is low in addition the finite length channel analytic solutions have shown that the upstream stage hydrograph and the lateral inflows concur in determining the discharge at the upstream end of the channel in particular this means that the upstream stage hydrograph and the lateral inflows cannot be assigned autonomously if the discharge upstream is assumed positive finally when the semi infinite channel assumption is made in flood routing models the use of a stage hydrograph upstream should be preferred for the calculation of flow depths the authors hope that these results will encourage researchers to develop simplified models based on the imposition of a stage hydrograph upstream rather than a flow hydrograph possibly accounting for the downstream boundary conditions acknowledgements this research was partially funded by the university of naples parthenope through the funding programs sostegno alla ricerca individuale 2015 2017 and

7162,the linearized parabolic approximation of the saint venant equations is often used for flood routing but the corresponding analytic solutions usually neglect the downstream boundary conditions this is an issue because the presence of hydraulic structures at the end of a river reach or natural morphologic conditions may influence the wave propagation in order to take into account realistic boundary conditions namely a stage hydrograph upstream and a stage discharge relationship downstream a new set of exact solutions of the linearized parabolic approximation of the saint venant equations with uniformly distributed lateral inflows is presented this exact solution is demonstrated by using it as a building block in a simplified flood routing model whose numerical results are compared with those supplied by laboratory experiments from literature finally the new solutions are used to analyze the range of validity of semi infinite channel models the comparison shows that semi infinite channel models are accurate when convective effects are prevailing on diffusive effects and the downstream boundary condition corresponds to uniform flow conditions in addition the results show that semi infinite channel models based on the knowledge of the upstream stage hydrograph can predict flow depths better than those making use of a flow hydrograph while being practically equivalent in predicting flow rates keywords diffusive wave analytical solution backwater effects boundary conditions channel routing simplified model 1 introduction the saint venant equations sves are commonly used for the description of one dimensional unsteady flow in rivers or artificial channel networks cunge et al 1980 the exact solution of the sves is available for schematic cases only and appropriate numerical methods such as the finite difference method vukovic and sopta 2003 xing and shu 2006 the finite element method szymkiewicz 1991 and the finite volume method garcia navarro and vazquez cendon 2001 liang and marche 2009 cozzolino et al 2012 can be used for real world applications despite the availability of reliable numerical procedures the application of the full one dimensional saint venant numerical models may suffer from a number of drawbacks such as the lack of cross section topographic data obtained by traditional ground or lidar surveys hutton et al 2012 the incorrect application of internal and external boundary conditions cunge et al 1980 sobey 2001 the arbitrariness in the choice of cross sections location and orientation and the uncertainties of the friction coefficients hunter et al 2007 these practical issues may overshadow the advantage of an accurate physical representation in addition the courant friedrichs lewy restriction of the time step in explicit time marching numerical models murillo et al 2006 may advice against the use of the sves in the case of forecasting applications control problems and design applications involving monte carlo approaches neal et al 2012 to overcome these drawbacks simplified models are considered an attractive alternative to fully dynamic models hunter et al 2007 bates et al 2010 cheviron and moussa 2016 the parabolic approximation pa is a non linear simplification of the sves obtained by neglecting inertial terms which are often negligible in practical hydrologic applications chow et al 1988 kazezyılmaz alhan 2012 the pa model has been used in numerous applications as river flow propagation cappelaere 1997 flood events simulation moussa and bocquillon 2009 drainage systems simulation xu and schwanenberg 2017 flow propagation with significant lateral contributions spada et al 2017 optimal design of rural drainage systems cimorelli et al 2013a moreover the applicability limits of the non linear model have been actively studied ponce and simons 1977 ponce et al 1978 fread 1985 ferrick 1985 dooge and napiorkowski 1987 chung et al 1993 moussa 1996 tsai 2003 2005 fan and li 2006 prestininzi 2008 cimorelli et al 2014 in practical cases requiring massive and fast calculations the linearized parabolic approximation lpa obtained by linearization of the non linear pa model may help to reduce the computational burden the analytic solutions of the lpa model have been used as a building block in numerous applications such as non linear flow routing with simplified backwater modelling todini and bossi 1986 cimorelli et al 2013b multilinear approaches becker and kundzewicz 1987 perumal et al 2008 perumal et al 2010 flow routing modeling in semi distributed rainfall runoff model todini 1996 moussa et al 2007 flow routing in non uniform channels by means of a cascade of diffusive linear models cimorelli et al 2015 propagation of the uncertainty chang and yeh 2016a b river flow modelling in karstic areas charlier et al 2015a b optimal management of small agricultural catchments colin et al 2011 influence of rainfall spatial variability on rainfall runoff modelling emmanuel et al 2015 the main advantage of analytical solutions is the unconditional stability of the associated numerical models thus allowing for long time steps especially when accuracy is not an issue wang et al 2014 interestingly the lpa is related to other widely used simplified models such as the muskingum cunge mc model cunge 1969 weinmann and laurenson 1979 that can be transformed into an equivalent lpa by matching physical and numerical diffusion cunge 1969 even though it was originally derived from the kinematic wave simplification of the sves in the literature many efforts have been spent to develop simplified stage hydrograph routing models because upstream gauge information is usually available in the form of stage hydrographs this is also convenient because upstream flow hydrograph boundary conditions require the evaluation of the rating curve which is often lacking or inaccurate spada et al 2017 following this approach physically based stage hydrograph models such has the variable parameter muskingum stage hydrograph are now available perumal and ranga raju 1998a b perumal et al 2007 2009 2010a b unfortunately the analytic solutions of the lpa with stage hydrograph imposed upstream do not take into account downstream boundary conditions see the review in cimorelli et al 2014 and the semi infinite channel analytic solution by hayami 1951 is usually assumed in practical applications the only exception is the model by tingsanchali and manandhar 1985 whose applicability is limited because it is based on the knowledge of the downstream stage hydrograph as pointed out by numerous authors chung et al 1993 munier et al 2008 cimorelli et al 2014 2015 cozzolino et al 2014 structures or channel geometric singularities weirs sluice gates bridge piles which influence the stage discharge relationship downstream may significantly affect the flow dynamics this makes the semi infinite channel solution by hayami 1951 inadequate in many cases therefore it is clear that the construction of the lpa analytic solution in finite length channels with stage hydrograph upstream boundary condition and given rating curve imposed downstream is an attractive task following the approach used in cimorelli et al 2014 for the case of discharge hydrograph upstream boundary conditions this analytical solution is supplied in the present work by applying the laplace transform technique the findings are compared with the experimental results of a laboratory test showing the suitability of the finite length channel analytical solution in simplified flow routing models only the flow depth response of the semi infinite channel lpa with stage hydrograph imposed upstream with lateral inflow is available in the literature hayami 1951 for this reason this solution is complemented in the present work by the corresponding discharge response to the stage hydrograph imposed upstream with lateral inflow this allows the comparison with the new finite length channel solution in order to evaluate the applicability limits of the hayami 1951 solution the results of this comparison are of interest not only for the lpa based flow routing models but also for those mc models perumal and ranga raju 1998a b perumal et al 2007 2009 2010a b where a stage hydrograph is considered upstream the paper is organized as follows in section 2 the novel finite length channel analytical solutions are presented in section 3 the complete semi infinite channel solution is derived for upstream stage hydrograph and lateral inflow in section 4 the finite length and the semi infinite channel analytical solutions are compared by considering the results of a laboratory experiment from the literature in section 5 the applicability limits of the semi infinite channel solution is accomplished by comparing its unit step response with that of the finite length channel finally the conclusions are drawn in section 6 2 finite length channel analytical solution with stage hydrograph imposed upstream in the present section the lpa model is presented and the corresponding analytic solution in finite length channels with stage hydrograph upstream boundary condition and given rating curve imposed downstream is derived 2 1 lpa governing equations the parabolic approximation pa of the saint venant equations for a prismatic channel can be written as cunge et al 1980 1 q x b h t q h x s 0 s f 0 where q x t is the discharge h x t is the flow depth b x h is the channel width s 0 x is the bed slope and s f q h x is the friction slope if eq

dimensionless coefficients appearing in eqs 2 and 3 are defined as 4 c r 1 b r s f h s f q r β h r q r b r c r r 1 l s f q r q r h r r 2 s f h r l where the partial derivatives of the slope friction

the pèclet number 6 p e c r l d r which expresses the relative importance of flow advection and diffusion it is easy to see from 4 and 5 that pe β r1 2 2 finite length channel general solution in the laplace domain the laplace transform of eq 2 is 7 q x β s h β h 0 q h x r 1 q r 2 h 0 where s is the complex laplace variable q x s h x s and q x s are the laplace transforms of q x t h x t and q x t respectively while h 0 x h x 0 is the initial condition of the first order flow depth increment under the assumption that the lateral inflow is uniform in space and the initial condition h 0 x is null the general solution of eq 7 is cimorelli et al 2014 8 q x s h x s γ x s q 0 s h 0 s γ x s q s where q x s h x s t is the frequency domain solution vector q 0 s h 0 s t is the frequency domain upstream boundary condition vector and q s q x s in eq 8 the matrix 9 γ x s γ 11 x s γ 12 x s γ 21 x s γ 22 x s is the state transition matrix while γ x s γ 11 x s γ 21 x s t is a vector taking into account the lateral inflow contribution the expressions of γ x s and γ x s are deduced in cimorelli et al 2014 and are reported in the appendix a of the present work for the reader s ease the eq 8 represents the laplace domain general solution of eq 7 and it must be complemented with the correct boundary conditions and lateral inflows to obtain the desired particular solutions 2 3 particular solutions with upstream stage hydrograph and downstream stage discharge function a stage hydrograph h 0 t is assumed as upstream boundary condition while the stage discharge relationship q l t f sg h l t is assumed downstream in order to derive the analytical solution of eq 7 the linearized dimensionless expressions of these boundary conditions are needed upstream the first order increment h 0 t h 0 t h r of the stage hydrograph function is considered and the corresponding dimensionless form h 0 t h 0 t h r is immediately obtained downstream the stage discharge relationship is linearized around the flow depth hr and is then reduced in dimensionless form the corresponding expression is 10 q 1 t β α h 1 t where the dimensionless abscissa x 1 corresponds to x l the parameter α b r c r k where k d f sg h r dh quantifies how much the downstream boundary conditions deviates from the steady uniform flow along the channel the laplace transform of eq 10 finally leads to the laplace domain downstream boundary condition 11 q 1 t β α h 1 t the substitution of eq 11 into eq 8 for x 1 supplies 12 q 0 s γ 12 1 s β α 1 γ 22 1 s γ 11 1 s β α 1 γ 21 1 s h 0 s γ 11 1 s β α 1 γ 21 1 s γ 11 1 s β α 1 γ 21 1 s q s the eq 12 represents the unique relationship between upstream flow depth and upstream discharge that is compatible in a finite length channel where eq 11 describes the downstream boundary condition the substitution of eq 12 into the first of eq 8 allows to eliminate q 0 s leading to the flow depth response of a finite length channel to a stage hydrograph imposed upstream with lateral inflow contribution 13 h x s w u x s h 0 s w l x s q s in eq 13 the function w u x s represents the flow depth laplace domain response to an upstream stage hydrograph unit pulse while w l x s represents the flow depth laplace domain response to a lateral inflow unit pulse these functions are defined as 14 w u x s e p e x 2 p e 2 α sinh 1 x 2 z α z cosh 1 x 2 z p e 2 α sinh 1 2 z α z cosh 1

of rectangles chow et al 1988 wang et al 2014 is defined as the primitive of the unit pulse response therefore the laplace transform inversion theorem ahlfors 1979 can be used to show that the unit

the eqs 23 and 25 represent the flow depth and the discharge response respectively to the stage hydrograph unit step input at the upstream end of the channel similarly eqs 24 and 26 represent the flow depth and the discharge response respectively to the lateral inflow unit step input when the upstream flow depth is given the eqs 23 26 are valid under the condition α 2 if α 2 the hyperbolic sines at the denominators of eqs 14 15 and 17 18 vanish and the time domain solutions are simplified see appendix b remark 1 it is important to note that the eqs 24 and 26 differ from the eqs 38 and 36 in cimorelli et al 2014 that represent the flow depth and discharge response respectively to the lateral inflow unit step input when the upstream discharge is given the expressions of eqs 23 26 are totally new 3 analytical solution in semi infinite channel with stage hydrograph imposed upstream the flow depth response of eq 7 is already known in the semi infinite channel when a stage hydrograph is imposed upstream hayami 1951 in particular the function 27 w u x t 1 2 e r f c x t 4 t p e 1 2 e p e x e r f c x t 4 t p e represents the flow depth response to the upstream stage hydrograph unit step input the corresponding discharge response is not available in the literature and it is derived in the present section first the linearized parabolic rating curve is obtained from the second of eq 2 28 q β h β p e h x if the position h x t w u x t is made in eq 27 and the eq 27 is substituted in eq 28 the expression 29 y u x t β 2 e r f c x t 4 t p e β π p e t e x t 2 4 t p e is obtained after the position y u x t q x t the eq 29 represents the discharge response to the stage hydrograph unit step imposed upstream the substitution of the second of eq 7 into the first supplies the following flow depth advection diffusion equation hayami 1951 30 1 p e 2 h x 2 h x h t q which formally coincides with the discharge advection diffusion equation ade by cunge 1969 for this reason the solutions of eq 30 can be borrowed from the solutions of the discharge ade form if the analytic derivation contained in franchini and todini 1988 is applied to eq 30 it can be shown that the function 31 w l x t t 1 2 t x e r f c x t 4 t p e 1 2 t x e p e x e r f c x t 4 t p e is the flow depth response to the uniform lateral inflow unit step input in the semi infinite channel for given flow depth imposed upstream if the position h x t w l x t is made in eq 31 the substitution in eq 28 supplies the expression 32 y l x t β t π p e e x t 2 4 t p e β t β 2 t x 1 2 p e e r f c x t 4 t p e β 2 p e t x e p e x e r f c x t 4 t p e which represents the discharge response to the unit step uniform lateral inflow in the semi infinite channel for given flow depth imposed upstream remark 2 the discharge responses of eqs 29 and 32 are novel and complement the flow depth responses of eqs 27 and 31 which are already available in the literature 4 numeric application of the finite length and semi infinite channel analytical solutions a simple linear flood routing model based on the analytic findings of the preceding sections is here presented the flood routing model is then used to reproduce the results of a laboratory test case from the literature 4 1 a simple linear flood routing model in the case of uniform linear channel a simplified version of the iltdfr model cimorelli et al 2015 can be used to route a stage hydrograph imposed upstream let i t h 0 t h 0 t h r h r be the dimensionless stage hydrograph at the inlet of the channel this function is represented by the sequence of rectangular pulses 33 i k 1 δ t k 1 δ t k δ t i τ d τ k 1 2 where δ t is the dimensionless time interval the flow depth response of the channel at the station x and time t n n δ t n 1 2 is immediately calculated as 34 h x t n k 1 n i k w x n k 1 δ t w x n k δ t where w x t w u x t when the downstream boundary condition is taken into account while w x t w u x t whether the effect of the downstream boundary condition is neglected semi infinite channel 4 2 numeric application the linear model of eq 33 is applied to the experimental results by rashid and chaudhry 1995 the original experimental setup consisted of a flume lf 21 m long with uniform longitudinal bed slope compound rectangular cross section rectangular main channel with rectangular floodplains and manning s roughness coefficient dependent on the flow depth an inclined sluice gate with bed sill was present at the downstream end of the laboratory flume and the corresponding stage discharge relation was expressed by 35 f sg h c h a m where a is the sill height in eq 35 the constants c 9 35 and m 1 14 were experimentally determined by rashid and chaudhry 1995 nine gauging stations were located at different distances from the flume inlet table 1 and the actual channel length used in the computations is l 18 6 m because the upstream boundary condition is given by the flow depth record at the gauging station 1 the geometric characteristics of the flume and the initial conditions of the experiments are reported in rashid and chaudhry 1995 and their complete description is not repeated here first the model of eq 33 is applied with w x t w u x t finite length channel model to the test 1 where the flow occupies the entire compound cross section the parameters pe α and β needed for the calculation of the finite length channel response function w u x t of eq 25 are evaluated with respect to the initial condition of test 1 and no calibration is performed in particular hr is computed as the average value of the initial backwater profile qr is set equal to the initial discharge and the reference conditions used for the downstream boundary conditions are those corresponding to the reference discharge qr the results of the simulation with time step δt 10 s thin continuous line are compared in fig 1 with the experimental results circles from the figure it is evident that the uniform linear channel model reproduces nicely the flow depth hydrograph at the gauging station 2 fig 1a which is close to the inlet while the essentials of the flow propagation phenomenon are captured at the gauging station 5 fig 1b located at the middle of the channel it is very important to observe that better results could be obtained if a cascade of uniform diffusive channels were used after a calibration of the parameters cimorelli et al 2015 in fig 1 the results of a full saint venant finite difference model by rashid and chaudhry 1995 are also reported the comparison with the experimental results shows that the parabolic linear model does not behave worse than the full saint venant equations for this test case the discrepancy between the experimental results and the numerical results at the gauging station 5 can be explained recalling that the cross section is compound with initial conditions corresponding to more than 0 20 m of flow depth in the main channel and less of 0 01 m of flow depth over the lateral floodplains the finite length model is then applied to the test 2 where the flow is entirely contained into the main rectangular channel the close inspection of fig 2 shows that the uniform linear channel model reproduces nicely the flow depth hydrograph at both the gauging stations 2 fig 2a and 5 fig 2b the improvement of the numerical results can be explained recalling that now the wetted area corresponds to a compact cross section in the same figure the results of the numerical model by rashid and chaudhry 1995 are also reported again the comparison shows that the results supplied by the finite length linear model are of comparable quality to those supplied by the full saint venant model tests 1 and 2 are repeated considering the semi infinite channel model w x t w u x t in eq 33 the results are represented in figs 1 and 2 respectively with symbol the comparison with the experimental results clearly shows that the semi infinite channel model behaves worse than the finite length model 5 comparison between semi infinite channel and finite length channel analytical solutions the findings of the previous section suggest that the finite length channel analytical solutions are more accurate than the semi infinite channel analytical solutions in reproducing real flows therefore the applicability of the semi infinite channel solutions is discussed by comparison with the corresponding finite length channel solutions the analysis is accomplished considering the unit step responses because these functions are used as a building block in practical numerical methods where input hydrographs are represented by means of rectangular pulses sequences todini and bossi 1986 chow et al 1988 cimorelli et al 2013b 2015 2016 wang et al 2014 values of pe and α representative of realistic situations are considered while the constant β 1 is taken as this coefficient is just a scaling factor first the dependence of the flow depth responses on pe and α is commented and finally the nash sutcliffe efficiency index is used for an objective comparison 5 1 flow depth response to a unit step stage hydrograph imposed upstream the eqs 23 and 27 represent the flow depth responses of finite length and semi infinite channels respectively to a unit step stage hydrograph imposed upstream the functions are plotted in the plane t h of fig 3 for different values of the parameters pe 0 5 2 5 and 5 and α 0 5 1 and 1 5 and at different locations x 0 2 0 4 0 6 0 8 1 a continuous line is used for the finite length channel response while a dashed line is used for the finite length channel response first the finite length channel flow depth response h w u x t of eq 23 is considered the value α 0 5 panels in the left column of fig 3 is representative of a downstream boundary condition where a free fall or a critical flow depth occurs at the downstream end congruently with the physical meaning of the downstream boundary condition the flow depth decreases with x at a given t for every value of pe for α 1 panels in the central column of fig 3 as time increases the flow depth tends asymptotically to h 1 everywhere this behavior is consistent with α 1 being representative of a normal depth downstream boundary condition the value α 1 5 panels in the right column of fig 3 is representative of an obstacle downstream such as a sluice gate or a weir in this case the eq 23 exhibits a noticeable backwater effect propagating from downstream with increasing t correspondingly h w u x t has a twisted behavior because the flow depth decreases with x for smaller values of t when the wave entering upstream has not reached the downstream boundary condition and increases with x for greater values of t because the wave is reflecting at the downstream boundary conditions the response h w u x t of eq 30 depends on pe only and not on α for this reason the corresponding plots in the left column of fig 3 are equal to those of the central and the right column and no twisted behavior is exhibited a closer inspection shows that lower values of pe cause a faster growth of h w u x t but the asymptotic value of h obtained for increasing t is not affected in addition h decreases with x at a given time t 5 2 flow depth response to a unit step uniformly distributed lateral inflow the functions h w l x t of eq 24 and h w l x t of eq 31 are plotted in the plane t h of fig 4 with the same parameters pe α and x used for fig 3 the finite length channel response to the lateral inflow is quite different from the response to the upstream stage hydrograph when a 0 5 free fall condition at the downstream end the time asymptotic flow depth value of h w l x t increases from x 0 to a maximum in x 0 8 and then decreases from x 0 8 to x 1 this differs from the case of h w u x t in fig 3 where the flow depth is always decreasing when α 1 uniform flow at the downstream end the time asymptotic value of h w l x t increases along the channel while h w u x t exhibits the same asymptotic value h 1 at every cross section finally when α 1 5 sluice gate or weir at the downstream end h w l x t increases regularly with x at any instant t while h w u x t exhibits a twisted behavior the semi infinite channel response h w l x t can reproduce the results of eq 24 only for high values of pe and close to the upstream channel end when p e 5 the two solutions behave similarly for x from 0 2 to 0 6 and for each value of α when p e 2 5 the two solutions exhibit similar behaviors for x from 0 2 to 0 4 and for α 1 finally the plots of eqs 24 and 31 are very different at any position along the channel and for any value of α when p e 0 5 5 3 discharge response to a unit step stage hydrograph imposed upstream the functions q y u x t of eq 25 and q y u x t of eq 29 are plotted in the plane t q of fig 5 with the same parameters of figs 3 and 4 from fig 5 it is evident that the function q y u x t exhibits a peak originated at the channel inlet that moves and decays along the channel actually when the inlet flow depth h increases instantly from 0 to 1 unit step stage hydrograph the linearized looped rating curve of eq 28 prescribes that the derivative at the right hand side is a negative delta function for this reason the second term at the right hand side of eq 28 is a positive delta function that sums up with the first term a unit step for t 0 this delta function is convected and diffused along the channel while the discharge entering upstream tends to an asymptotic value that depends on h and its space derivative a closer inspection of eq 28 shows that the inlet discharge peak weakens when pe increases and vanishes when pe tends to infinity while the dependency on α of the time asymptotic discharge value decreases with pe the function q y u x t of eq 29 is inadequate to mimic the finite channel model when pe 0 5 conversely the solution is well reproduced almost everywhere along the channel with exclusion of x 1 when p e 5 finally the correspondence between eqs 25 and eq 29 is strongly influenced by α when p e 2 5 but there is a reasonable correspondence for x 0 6 5 4 discharge response to unit step lateral inflows a plot of the functions q y l x t of eq 26 and q y l x t of eq 32 is reported in fig 6 with the same parameters considered in the preceding subsections the inspection of the figure shows that the infinite length and semi infinite channel solutions exhibit negative discharges in the vicinities of x 0 for low values of pe when uniform lateral inflow is imposed this feature can be easily explained recalling that eqs 26 and 32 are found under the assumption h 0 t 0 for t 0 which allows the separation of effects from the case of a stage hydrograph boundary condition imposed upstream according to eq 28 this implies that the discharge q along the channel is negative when p e h h x this is precisely what happens for low values of pe in the vicinities of x 0 where h is small and h x 0 physically speaking the conditions in which these new solutions are derived can be representative of a water body in the upstream cross section a lake or the sea a tank served by a pump where the constant level allows the lateral discharge injected along the channel to partly flow upstream when a null or positive discharge is expected at the upstream end eqs 26 or 32 are not autonomous andmust be complemented by a proper upstream stage hydrograph interestingly this also means that the upstream stage hydrograph cannot be assigned arbitrarily if lateral inflows are present therefore when the lateral inflow is the only input the exact solution with discharge imposed upstream cimorelli et al 2014 should be preferred the fig 6 shows that the function q y l x t of eq 32 does not match the function q y l x t of eq 26 for p e 0 5 when p e 2 5 the two solutions behave qualitatively in a similar manner but there are significant differences for α 0 5 and α 1 while the differences are small for α 1 5 for p e 5 the results given by the two solutions are similar except for the location x 1 5 5 backwater effect analysis to establish the range of validity of the semi infinite channel solutions presented in section 3 the efficiency index ns by nash and sutcliffe 1970 36 ns 1 i 1 i max f t i f o t i 2 i 1 i max f o t i f o 2 is used in eq 36 f t i and f o t i are the approximating and the true function respectively evaluated at the time instant ti with i 1 2 i max while f o is the mean value of the true function the index ns ranges in 1 where ns 1 indicates a perfect match between the two models while ns 0 means that the prediction made by the approximating model has the same accuracy of the time averaged value of the true one in this subsection the values in x 1 of the semi infinite channel solutions are taken as the approximating models while the step responses of eqs 23 26 at the same abscissa are taken as the true models all the computations are performed considering p e 0 10 and a 0 3 in the following the interval ns 0 7 is considered as representative of a satisfactory matching moriasi et al 2007 the contour plot in fig 7 represents the results of eq 36 when eqs 23 and 27 are compared it is evident from the figure that there is a region p e α 1 10 0 6 1 4 where h w u x t eq 27 provides a good approximation of h w u x t eq 23 from a practical point of view this is significant because the interval 0 6 α 1 3 is wide enough to represent the downstream boundary conditions usually encountered in river applications this result is consistent with the numerical application of section 4 in experiment 1 pe 1 04 and α 0 126 while in experiment 2 pe 0 016 and α 0 0124 and in both cases the semi infinite solution failed to reproduce the numerical experiment the outcomes are quite different fig 8 when h w l x t eq 24 and h w l x t eq 31 are compared because in this case the region of validity of h w l x t is reduced to p e α 2 10 1 1 1 5 the contour plot of eq 36 computed using q y u x t eq 25 and q y u x t eq 29 is depicted in fig 9 despite the use of the flow depth as upstream boundary condition the discharge response q y u x t matches the finite length channel response q y u x t better than the flow depth response h w u x t matches the finite length model h w u x t because the area of validity starts from a point p e α 0 5 0 5 and spreads up covering the whole range of considered α at p e 2 actually the propagation of the discharge by means of semi infinite channels model seems more robust than the propagation of the flow depth which is greatly influenced by the downstream boundary condition a similar conclusion can be deduced by looking at the contour plot of fig 10 where eq 36 is calculated considering q y l x t eq 26 and q y l x t eq 32 6 discussion the exact solutions of eq 7 for the cases of finite length and semi infinite channels have been systematically compared in section 4 showing that the péclet number pe and the downstream boundary condition coefficient α are the parameters controlling the suitability of the semi infinite channel solutions the lower values of pe correspond to short channels or to cases where diffusivity effects are not negligible with respect to the convection effects conversely the higher values of pe correspond to long channels or to cases where the convection effects are predominant congruently with the physical interpretation of pe the comparison between the finite length and the semi infinite channel solutions shows that the downstream boundary conditions cannot be neglected when pe is low or α is far from 1 conversely the use of the semi infinite channel model is reliable when pe is high and α is close to 1 in addition the analysis has shown that the semi infinite channel model with flow depth imposed upstream predicts q x t better than h x t because the flow depth is more directly influenced by the downstream boundary condition but the range of validity of h x t is satisfactory for large pe these results can be compared with the findings contained in cimorelli et al 2014 where the range of validity of semi infinite channel solutions was considered when discharge was imposed upstream for that case it was concluded that the range of validity of semi infinite channel models for the prediction of h x t was very narrow while the range of validity for the prediction of q x t was larger in conclusion semi infinite channel models that use a stage hydrograph as upstream boundary condition are able to predict the flow depths better than the semi infinite channel models where the upstream flow hydrograph is routed while minor differences are found when the prediction of the discharge is considered for this reason semi infinite channel models with stage hydrograph imposed upstream should be used when an accurate prediction of the flow depth is required these conclusions are not limited to the lpa model only since the downstream boundary conditions are neglected in many of the approximate flood routing models that are used in the hydrology practice one of the most employed of these models is the mc model which is equivalent to the advection diffusion equation ade form of the lpa in semi infinite channels if its parameters are properly chosen cunge 1969 tang et al 1999 wang et al 2006 for this reason the applicability limits studied here also supply useful indications about the range of applicability of the mc model with a stage hydrograph boundary condition perumal and ranga raju 1998a b perumal et al 2007 2009 2010a b 7 conclusions a novel set of analytical solutions for the linearized parabolic approximation lpa of the sve has been derived in this paper considering a stage hydrograph upstream boundary condition uniform lateral inflows and a stage discharge relationship as downstream boundary condition these solutions are motivated by the fact that downstream boundary conditions control structures obstructions such as bridge piles sills jumps can modify significantly the flow dynamics for further comparison these analytical solutions have been complemented by the corresponding analytical solutions in the semi infinite channel the numerical results of a numerical application have suggested that a simple flood routing model equipped with the finite length channel exact solution behaves better than the semi infinite channel solution in reproducing the experimental results obtained in a laboratory channel this finding has suggested a systematic comparison of finite length and semi infinite channel analytic solutions in order to analyze the applicability of the routing models based on the semi infinite channel length assumptions from the comparison it is evident that the downstream boundary conditions can be neglected only when the péclet number is high and the downstream rating curve is not far from a normal depth one conversely the semi infinite channel models should not be used if the péclet number is low in addition the finite length channel analytic solutions have shown that the upstream stage hydrograph and the lateral inflows concur in determining the discharge at the upstream end of the channel in particular this means that the upstream stage hydrograph and the lateral inflows cannot be assigned autonomously if the discharge upstream is assumed positive finally when the semi infinite channel assumption is made in flood routing models the use of a stage hydrograph upstream should be preferred for the calculation of flow depths the authors hope that these results will encourage researchers to develop simplified models based on the imposition of a stage hydrograph upstream rather than a flow hydrograph possibly accounting for the

7163,this study focuses on the identification of the lateral preferential flow at the hillslope scale and the estimation of the saturated hydraulic conductivity for the fast flow region ks f based on infiltration experiments carried out at different spatial scales point and plot scales and at different soil depths the discrepancies between the considered scales were mainly attributed to macropore flow and the difficulty in adequately embodying the macropore network on small sampled soil volumes conversely at the plot scale the sampled volume was sufficient to activate the macropore network this information helped establish the usability of a given technique to determine the parameters describing the hydraulic properties of the soil in the matrix and fast flow regions while ks data obtained from the beerkan method with the beerkan estimation of soil transfer best parameter algorithm point scale were used to describe the matrix ks m the saturated hydraulic conductivity for the fast flow region was estimated using the soil block method plot scale estimated ks f values were one to three orders of magnitude higher than ks m the overall decrease of ks f with the soil depth supported the hypothesis that the macropore density decreased as a function of depth yielding higher macropore flow variability the soil block method in association with the beerkan infiltration runs allowed the estimation of the saturated hydraulic conductivity for the fast flow region based on a relatively simple field procedure keywords beerkan best algorithm in situ soil block method cube method lateral preferential flow macropore 1 introduction scarcity of water has been universally recognized as a global issue vörösmarty et al 2000 climatic changes have profound effects on the hydrological cycle thus reducing the availability of water resources in many environments groppelli et al 2011 in semiarid and arid regions increasing demands on limited water supplies require urgent efforts to improve water quality and quantity by preserving and improving the groundwater recharge of surface water bodies scanlon et al 2006 recharge processes can be classified as uniform downward movements of water through the unsaturated zone piston flow and nonuniform downward water movement along more active pathways also referred to as preferential flow sukhija et al 2003 preferential flow can contribute to the rapid transport of contaminants from the soil surface into receiving streams bypassing the filtering capacity of the soil e g lamy et al 2009 lassabatere et al 2007 prédélus et al 2017 water flow may mainly occur via preferential flow paths blöschl and sivapalan 1995 especially at the hillslope scale therefore there is an urgent need to assess procedures and techniques for characterizing water transport in hillslopes especially when this transport appears to be affected by preferential flow paths which may be induced by structural cracks faunal activity or roots specific pedological conditions and soil management practices angulo jaramillo et al 2016 the saturated soil hydraulic conductivity ks exerts a dominating influence on the partitioning of rainfall in vertical and lateral flow paths dusek et al 2012 therefore estimates of ks are essential for describing and modeling hydrological processes niedda and pirastru 2013 zimmermann et al 2013 however this soil property may be scale dependent mainly owing to the soil structure preferential flow paths and heterogeneities whose effects cannot be observed and quantified in measurements conducted on small soil volumes in addition the scale dependence of flow and transport parameters essentially makes the use of parameters estimated through pedotransfer functions for numerical simulations impossible pachepsky et al 2014 the saturated hydraulic conductivity must be measured in the laboratory or field several studies have shown that the saturated soil hydraulic conductivity values ks measured on macroporous soils can vary over several orders of magnitude depending on the sampled soil volume chapuis et al 2005 for instance vepraskas and williams 1995 compared ks values using sample volumes equal to 3 5 10 4 6 3 10 3 and 6 8 10 1 m3 concluding that the minimum sample size needed in situ for ks measurements ought to be approximately equal to at least 5 10 3 m3 experiments used to determine ks values at different spatial scales were performed by chappell and lancaster 2007 these authors applied six field methods namely slug tests constant and falling head borehole permeameters a ring permeameter and two types of trench tests the ks values determined by the larger scale experiments i e the trench percolation tests were on average 37 times larger than the mean conductivity obtained by slug tests conducted using piezometers positioned near the trenches chappell and lancaster 2007 brooks et al 2004 discussed different reasons to explicate such a discrepancy for instance small samples may not adequately represent water transmission since smaller sampled volumes imply a smaller opportunity to include macropores zobeck et al 1985 in particular the extent of the macropores in the porous medium was considered as the main factor in determining the gap between measurements hillslope scale measurements overcome the lack of representativeness commonly encountered in small scale measurements and allow process characterization at the appropriate scale these types of measurements are therefore recommended for model calibration however the number of studies that have focused on the assessment of large scale experiments and their comparisons with smaller scale experiments have been limited among the studies that focused on large scale experiments those that have addressed preferential or macropore flows are particularly few montgomery and dietrich 1995 compared the hydraulic conductivity calculated from a gully head cut with those observed in falling head tests only the higher values obtained from this latter experiment approached the bulk conductivity measured from the gully head cut by integrating through and macropore flows brooks et al 2004 proposed a methodology to measure the lateral ks values at the top of an impeding layer at the hillslope scale their measurements yielded ks values from one to two orders of magnitude larger than those measured at small scales on small soil cores and by using the guelph permeameter the discrepancy between measurements at different spatial scales was greatest near the surface and was attributed to the effect of the macropores furthermore according to these authors more economical methods are needed to obtain spatially distributed ks data or for routine measurements brooks et al 2004 reliable ks values should be measured on a soil volume similar to the minimum representative elementary volume rev to incorporate the natural heterogeneity of the soil mendoza and steenhuis 2002 the rev is the smallest volume over which a measurement can be made to yield a representative value of the entire porous medium pachepsky and hill 2017 its size depends on the soil structural characteristics and it is expected to increase for decreasing macropore spatial densities thus in order to adequately represent the hydrological effects of the macropore network the rev should include a sufficient number of nodes and branches in such a way to representatively embody the macropore network topology since it may control scale dependencies the in situ block method day et al 1998 has proven to be a useful tool for saturated soil hydraulic conductivity measurements this technique consists of measuring water flow in situ on a large undisturbed soil block that seals the exposed sides in order to confine water flow for example day et al 1998 measured water flow on a 3 38 m3 soil block the block s vertical faces were sealed using bentonite sand and lumber blanco canqui et al 2002 evaluated ks on three in situ 0 029 m3 soil blocks enclosed by steel plates and inserted approximately 35 cm below the soil surface and on bentonite slurry to seal the soil steel plate interfaces mendoza and steenhuis 2002 developed and tested a hillslope infiltrometer to measure in situ vertical and lateral saturated soil hydraulic conductivity the hillslope infiltrometer is a metal box installed around an undisturbed 0 045 m3 soil block slightly smaller than the infiltrometer starr et al 2005 designed an in situ steel chamber for studying water flow under shallow water table and riparian zone conditions the chamber was lowered over a 0 97 m3 soil block however ks measurements on the soil block remain rare for the following reasons i the need for a sloping impermeable bed to avoid deep water percolation ii the need to encase a large soil volume with impermeable materials so that all terms of darcy s law can be unambiguously defined iii the need for a number of operators over the entire duration of the experiment and the iv the need of a large displacement of liquid to reach steady state conditions during flow measurements several studies have considered small scale measurements on macroporous soils including both laboratory and in situ tests akay et al 2008 these approaches are generally simpler and parsimonious in terms of the experimental devices and required measurements however small scale measurements may not adequately represent ks depending on whether water flows through a small fraction of the soil along preferential flow paths bouma et al 1977 or only through the matrix in fact at this scale macropores are hardly intercepted while their continuity at the larger scale is unknown beven and germann 1982 zobeck et al 1985 moreover the presence of aggregates stones fissures fractures tension cracks and root holes commonly encountered in unsaturated soil profiles is difficult to represent in small samples haverkamp et al 1999 the dual permeability approach has been developed for modeling and for quantifying preferential flow gerke et al 2015 šimůnek et al 2003 the dual permeability approach assumes that soils encompass two regions including the matrix and the fast flow regions that respectively host the smallest and the larger pores lassabatere et al 2014 used the dual permeability approach to model water infiltration below ponded and tension infiltrometers in heterogeneous soils at the hillslope scale dusek et al 2012 studied the preferential flow effects on the subsurface runoff by combining a one dimensional 1d vertical dual continuum approach with a 1d lateral flow equation more recently different innovative approaches were proposed for dual and multiple permeability medium characterizations for instance abou najm and atallah 2016 proposed a new method to experimentally characterize porous media by using newtonian and non newtonian fluids lassabatere et al 2014 proposed the best 2 k method for hydraulic characterization of dual permeability media on the infiltration data acquired on the field however all these methods need to be further developed and tested to address processes at the small scale i e maximum meter scale the objective of this research was to characterize and quantify a lateral preferential flow at the hillslope scale for this purpose we considered the double permeability approach concomitancy of fast flow and matrix regions and estimated the saturated hydraulic conductivities of both fast flow and matrix regions ks f and ks m by coupling data from the infiltration experiments carried out at different spatial scales namely at point and plot scales specifically we combined the following experiments i in situ small scale measures of soil vertical hydraulic conductivity using the beerkan method ii laboratory small scale measures of vertical and horizontal hydraulic conductivity using the modified cube method and iii plot scale measure of lateral hydraulic conductivity using in situ soil blocks we assumed that beerkan runs would help the determination of the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the matrix and the modified cube method in the determination of the vertical and horizontal hydraulic conductivity of the soil these measures are then used to analyze the observed flow through the soil blocks and to identify and quantify the contribution of the matrix and the macropore network to the total lateral flux as a function of the volume of the soil block that is submitted to lateral flow 2 material and methods 2 1 study site description the study area consists of a north facing steep slope side located in the baratz lake basin niedda et al 2014 on sardinia s north west coast in italy 40 69825 n 8 2346 e wgs84 the site features a semiarid mediterranean climate with a mild winter warm summer and a high water deficit between april and september the mean annual temperature is 15 8 c the average annual precipitation is approximately 600 mm mainly concentrated from autumn to spring the potential evapotranspiration is approximately 1000 mm year 1 the experimental hillslope has elevations ranging from 51 to 65 m a s l and it is approximately 60 m long and with an average slope of 30 while the incoming surface and subsurface flows are diverted by the ditches on both sides of a road at the upper end the hillslope is drained by the main stream channel of the catchment at the toe the hillslope soil was classified as a lithic haploxerepts soil survey staff 2006 its profile is approximately 0 3 0 4 m deep the soil horizons include a bw and c pirastru et al 2014 the latter is a dense altered substratum of permian sandstone which exhibits very low permeability castellini et al 2016 during the rainy season a perched water table and lateral subsurface flow were observed owing to the presence of this restrictive layer in terms of vegetation the experimental area is covered with spontaneous grass grown after the clearing of the mediterranean maquis and deep moldboard ploughing the conversion into grassland took place approximately 15 years ago in order to create a 15 m wide firebreak the area has remained almost unmanaged ever since 2 2 soil sampling soil samples were collected at depths of 0 5 10 20 cm in particular undisturbed soil cores 0 05 m in height and 0 05 m in diameter were collected at randomly sampled points and were used to determine both the soil bulk density ρb g cm 3 and the initial volumetric soil water content θi cm3cm 3 the soil porosity was calculated from the ρb data assuming a soil particle density of 2 65 g cm 3 according to other investigations the field s saturated soil water content θs cm3cm 3 was equal to the porosity di prima et al 2018 mubarak et al 2009 disturbed soil samples were also collected inside the confined soil after each ponding infiltration runs and was used 50 g for each sample to determine the particle size distribution based on conventional methods following h2o2 pretreatment to eliminate organic matter and clay deflocculation using sodium metaphosphate and mechanical agitation gee and bauder 1986 in particular fine size fractions were determined using the hydrometer method whereas the coarse fractions were obtained by mechanical dry sieving according to usda standards the soil of the studied area was classified as sandy loam according to shirazi and boersma 1984 the geometric mean particle diameter was also estimated table 1 summarizes the physical parameters of the soil at the studied hillslope 2 3 in situ block method the soil block method aimed at including the lateral component of the preferential flow at the plot scale for lateral ks measurements more details on the soil block preparation can be found in di prima et al 2017b and pirastru et al 2017 at first four soil blocks with dimensions of 50 cm width by 105 cm length by 70 cm depth were obtained by careful hand digging of trenches with widths of 20 cm surrounding each soil block since the interface between the upper horizons and the restrictive substratum was located at a depth of approximately 38 cm the excavated soil blocks consisted of layered blocks and included the upper a and bw horizons and approximately 32 cm of impeding substratum no evidence of man made cracks was observed during the excavation process expandable polyurethane foam was then injected into the trench volumes in order to encase the exposed soil blocks this inert material is not expected to alter the chemical lewis et al 1990 and physical bagarello and sgroi 2008 characteristics of the soil and it concurrently prevents edge flows germer and braun 2015 after the foam was completely dried two pits were excavated up to the depth of the soil substratum interface in order to expose the up and downhill faces of the soil block and to create inflow ip and outflow pits op respectively at the end the resulting soil blocks hereafter referred to as sbs were associated with a geometrically calculated volume above the impeding layer that ranged from 0 100 to 0 163 m3 each drainage experiment consisted of four stages after a first satiation stage three water table depths wtds fig 1 were sequentially settled at 5 15 and 25 cm below the soil surface in the ip with a custom built mariotte bottle the large 50 l capacity of the bottle avoided the need of frequent refilling throughout the duration of the executed stages each imposed water table depth was maintained until the achievement of quasi steady state conditions a syphon system was used to impose from time to time the same water table depths in the op during these processing stages visual readings of the water level in the bottle were used to calculate the inflow rates as obtained through a liquid level gauge the excess water flowing from the op through the syphon system was measured by weighting the collected water volumes fig 2 depicts the experimental setup the total run duration varied between 260 and 460 min depending on the run a first attempt to measure outflow from the op was carried out using a 4 cm diameter pvc pipe used as a spillway at the downhill side the pipes were inserted in the dried foam at a smooth slope in order to maintain a constant water level and to divert the excess volume for collection this procedure was applied only on the sb1 because field observations revealed that the pipe installations produced a slight discontinuity between soil and foam thus resulting in leakages to avoid such a problem the syphon system was used for the other soil blocks fig 2 therefore for these latter experiments the water loss was small thus yielding similar inflow and outflow measurements fig 3 however in the third and fourth sbs the same differences between inflow and outflow rates were detected for wtd25 in particular water draining from progressive desaturation of the upper soil volume i e the layer that had a depth that ranged between 15 and 25 cm initially contributed to yield higher outflows during this stage the desaturation of the upper soil volume did not affect the inflow rates since the flow zone was already saturated during the previous stages of the experiment this difference was not observed in the sb2 experiment probably owing to the higher measured flow rates fig 3 therefore for the 2nd 3rd and 4th drainage experiments the outflows measured under quasi steady state conditions were used to estimate the lateral saturated soil hydraulic conductivity of the soil blocks ks sb mm h 1 according to darcy s formula as follows 1 k s s b q t s δ z where q l2t 1 is the flow of water per unit width of the block t l is the thickness of the flow zone measured perpendicular to the bed z l is the water table elevation from an arbitrary datum and s l is the distance measured on a straight line in the direction of the sloping bed in this investigation q t s and δz were measured during the field experiment or were determined using a simple geometry fig 1 we decided to use measured inflows rather than outflows only for the first sb1 experiment because i field observations during this experiment revealed localized water leakages from the op and the measured inflow was thus completely infiltrated through the sb1 and ii the measured inflow of the first experiment was consistent with the other ones 2 4 modified cube method the horizontal and vertical hydraulic conductivities of the saturated soil ks were determined based on the modified cube method mcm beckwith et al 2003 to gain insight on the potential effects of anisotropic conditions on the comparison between the ks measurements blanco canqui et al 2002 in fact the presence of layers parallel to the soil surface is expected to induce effective horizontal ks values that are greater than the vertical ones zaslavsky and rogowski 1969 according to the procedure described by bagarello and sgroi 2008 and bagarello et al 2009 a total of 20 soil cubes were collected at depths that ranged between 0 and 11 cm by carefully carving out 11 cm width by 11 cm length by 14 cm depth soil prisms fig 4 a a wooden box side length 17 cm that was open at the bottom and top sides was placed around each exposed soil prism fig 4b expandable polyurethane foam was injected between the box and the exposed soil and on the soil surface fig 4c to avoid foam adhesion and to facilitate reusing the box was wrapped with plastic wrap in order to confine the foam expansion a wood was positioned on the top of the box fig 4d after the total expansion of the foam the excess was cut off with a knife and the cube was marked to preserve direction a layer of soil with a 3 cm thickness was removed from the bottom of the prism to obtain a cubic soil sample finally the sample was completely encased by applying the foam at the bottom side in the laboratory the vertical conductivity ks v mcm was measured for ten randomly chosen cubes the cubes were taken from the wooden box and the foam was removed from the top and bottom faces using a knife the horizontal conductivity ks h mcm was measured for the remaining soil cubes in this latter case the foam was removed from the up and downhill faces of the cube for each cube a single measurement was carried out given that the first measurement may affect the second when bidirectional measurements are performed on a single soil cube bagarello et al 2009 a wire net was placed at the bottom face of the cube to support the weight of the soil the soil samples were then slowly saturated from the bottom for 24 h the constant head laboratory permeameter method klute and dirksen 1986 with an established ponding depth of 1 cm was applied to measure ks according to darcy s law a syphon was used to maintain the constant depth of ponding on the soil surface the use of a mariotte bottle with small ponding depths was avoided since it may promote turbulence close to the soil s surface potentially resulting in clogging the exposed pores bagarello et al 2009 the constant head permeameter used for measuring ks v mcm and ks h mcm was operated with water that flowed from the top and the uphill cube faces respectively the experiments were carried out until steady state conditions were established i e at approximately 30 95 min depending on the run the last 10 35 min of the measured flow rate data were used to calculate ks finally for each measurement direction the ten determinations of ks were averaged and the ratio ks h mcm ks v mcm was evaluated to check the occurrence of anisotropy i e the prevalence of the vertical ks h mcm ks v mcm 1 or horizontal ks h mcm ks v mcm 1 flow directions beckwith et al 2003 the chosen sample size n 10 was expected to yield representative mean ks v and ks l values at the scale considered in this investigation reynolds et al 2002 2 5 best method the beerkan estimation of the soil transfer best parameter method for soil hydraulic characterization introduced by lassabatere et al 2006 was chosen for this investigation to yield an estimate for the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the matrix since it constitutes a practical alternative to more cumbersome and time consuming methods bagarello et al 2014a indeed this method needs simple equipment and minimal field work and it is gaining popularity in soil science a total of 40 ponding infiltration runs of the beerkan type were carried out at the depths of 0 5 10 and 20 cm ten for each soil depth at randomly selected points of the hillslope a small diameter ring i e 8 cm inserted at a depth of 1 cm was used the soil disturbance was minimized by the limited ring insertion depth alagna et al 2013 a relatively small ring diameter was chosen since the total sampled area cannot be too large given that the ring had to be inserted on a sloping surface angulo jaramillo et al 2016 and to avoid the sampling of the macropore network for each run 15 water volumes each equal to 43 ml were successively poured on the confined infiltration surface the number of infiltrated volumes was sufficient to reach steady state as required by the beerkan methods lassabatere et al 2006 the energy of the falling water was dissipated with the hand fingers to minimize the soil disturbance owing to water pouring as commonly suggested e g alagna et al 2017 castellini et al 2018 di prima et al 2017a reynolds 1993 for each water volume the time needed for the water to infiltrate was logged and the cumulative infiltration i mm was plotted against time t s a regression line was then fitted to the last data points to describe the steady state conditions to estimate the experimental steady state infiltration rate is mm h 1 and the associated intercept bs mm the steady algorithm of best bagarello et al 2014b was then applied to estimate the saturated soil hydraulic conductivity ks best mm h 1 based on the following equation di prima et al 2016 2 k s b e s t c i s a b s c where the constants a mm 1 and c are defined as follows haverkamp et al 1994 3a a γ r θ s θ i 3b c 1 2 1 θ i θ s η 1 β ln 1 β where θi and θs refer to the initial and saturated water contents respectively γ parameter for geometrical correction of the infiltration front shape and β are the coefficients that are commonly set at 0 75 and 0 6 r mm is the radius of the disk source and η is a shape parameter that is estimated from the analysis of the particle size data with the pedotransfer function included in the best procedure lassabatere et al 2006 more details on the methods and the validation of equations based on fitted experimental data can be found in di prima et al 2016 and lassabatere et al 2009 in this investigation the best steady algorithm was chosen since it yields higher percentage of success i e positive ks values on the infiltration runs and allows simple calculation of ks as compared to other best algorithms namely best intercept yilmaz et al 2010 and best slope lassabatere et al 2006 2 6 dual permeability approach on the basis of the measures obtained from the beerkan runs and the block method it was expected that the hydraulic conductivity of macropores would be efficiently computed for dual permeability systems it is considered that the global hydraulic conductivity ks 2 k mm h 1 can be decoupled in terms of its contributions to the matrix and to the fast flow region gerke and van genuchten 1993 4 k s 2 k w f k s f 1 w f k s m where wf is the void ratio occupied by the fast flow region dimensionless i e the ratio of the volumes of the macropore and total flow regions and ks f and ks m mm h 1 are the saturated hydraulic conductivities for the fast flow and the matrix regions respectively in this investigation we assumed that we had an estimate for the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the matrix from the beerkan runs if we also assume that ks 2 k can be estimated by the bulk values obtained based on drainage experiments we can deduce the hydraulic conductivity of the fast flow region using eq 4 and its solution for ks f which leads to 5 k s f k s 2 k 1 w f k s m w f since the void ratio occupied by the fast flow region was unknown we have evaluated multiple scenarios with wf values ranging from 0 05 to 0 1 i e the fast flow region was considered to occupy 5 10 of the entire region this range was adopted since the fast flow fraction generally occupied a very small fraction of the soil s porosity bouma et al 1977 moreover these values were selected to agree with those reported by many dual permeability applications for instance dusek et al 2012 settled the wf values to 7 and 5 at the soil surface and at a 75 cm depth respectively in a hillslope covered with grass calamagrostis villosa and spruce picea abies for numerical simulations lassabatere et al 2014 considered a value of 10 for wf 2 7 data analyses ks data were assumed to be log normally distributed since the statistical distribution of these data is generally log normal lee et al 1985 warrick 1998 therefore the geometric mean mg and the associated standard deviation sd and coefficient of variation cv were calculated using the appropriate log normal equations lee et al 1985 the arithmetic mean ma was calculated for ρb θi and θs statistical comparison between the two sets of data was conducted using two tailed student s t tests whereas the tukey s honestly significant test was applied to compare three or more datasets the ln ks data were considered for comparative purposes since ks was better described by the log normal distribution than the normal distribution an updated version of the workbook by di prima 2013 was used to analyze the beerkan infiltration runs by the best steady algorithm all statistical analyses were carried out using the minitab computer program minitab inc state college pa usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 in situ and laboratory small scale measurements our results show that the ks values estimated with the beerkan method ks best progressively decreased with soil depth fig 5 a and table 2 from a statistical point of view results of the tukey s honestly significant difference test showed significant differences between the ks values measured at different soil depths the dry soil bulk density ρb ranged between 1 44 and 1 78 g cm 3 n 12 no differences were detected along the soil profile in terms of ρb table 1 conversely the ks best values increased with the sand content pearson s correlation coefficients r 0 471 p 0 002 and decreased with the clay content r 0 606 p 0 001 fig 5b the higher percentage of coarse particles in the upper soil layer could suggest a certain rigidity of the porous medium table 1 on the contrary the increase in clay particles with soil depth implies more opportunities for clogging the largest pores and thus lower ks values in the upper soil these values were very close to the prediction of saturated conductivity from soil textural characteristics e g ks 44 2 mm h 1 for a sandy loam soil according to carsel and parrish 1988 therefore the macroporosity did not likely influence the measured infiltration process in general isolated macropores are physically difficult to include in the sampled volume brooks et al 2004 using small rings in the soils with macropores with ring inner diameters of 8 cm in this investigation implies a relatively high probability to sample only the soil matrix this yields a measurement of ks that is representative only of the matrix instead of the entire system of macropores angulo jaramillo et al 2016 in addition using small rings also implies fewer opportunities of inclusion of continuous macropores intersecting the confined soil surface large rings appear more appropriate than small rings in eliciting a signal associated with the occurrence of soil macropores or fast flow regions in the field since smaller soil volumes are functionally more homogeneous than larger volumes bagarello et al 2013 castellini et al 2016 applied the beerkan method using a ring with an inner diameter of 15 cm to assess the physical quality of the upper soil of the same experimental hillslope these authors obtained similar results for ks mean 24 1 mm h 1 coefficient of variation cv 118 the mean ks values collected during the two sampling campaigns differed by a factor of 1 8 this could be considered practically negligible for many hydrological applications elrick and reynolds 1992 table 3 summarizes the parameters obtained by the modified cube method mcm the means of ks were equal to 173 0 and 167 1 mm h 1 for the vertical and horizontal directions respectively the mcm yielded statistically different and higher ks estimates than beerkan the comparison between these methods requires additional considerations that are discussed below in situ ks measurements allow the maintenance of the functional connections of the sampled volumes with the surrounding matrix e g bagarello et al 2017 bouma 1982 di prima 2015 lauren et al 1988 in comparison in the laboratory the overall connection of extracted soil samples is expected to be higher because of the increased probability of their impact by macropores and the interception of the edges of the extracted samples we thus conclude that the higher values of saturated hydraulic conductivity for the mcm method results from a partial activation of the largest pores in the soil samples this increase in connectivity was discussed in detail in a review article by pachepsky and hill 2017 to explain this effect these authors considered data from one dimensional vertical water flow experiments in these experiments ks decreased with increases of the soil column length l according to the following power law ks l m anderson and bouma 1973 attributed this effect to the increasing probability that pores will remain connected throughout the length of a core as a function of decreasing core lengths in particular for longer samples the water flux appears to be controlled by a more homogeneous soil matrix with lower hydraulic conductivity values the process discussed above essentially mimics what happens during the beerkan infiltration runs which allow the preservation of the functional connection of the sampled volume with the surrounding matrix thus yielding lower ks values than those obtained with the mcm samples biased by pores several examples of the overestimation of ks on extracted soil samples can be found in the literature for instance the increase in ks owing to open ended pores on undisturbed soil samples was assessed by blanco canqui et al 2002 these authors measured ks on 180 soil cores with 76 mm diameter 76 mm height with and without bentonite to seal the macropores these authors found that ks values without bentonite were approximately four times higher than the corresponding ks values with bentonite kanwar et al 1989 compared the ks values determined in situ using the guelph permeameter device reynolds and elrick 2005 and the velocity permeameter merva 1979 with those obtained in the laboratory based on the constant head permeameter method on undisturbed soil cores 75 mm diameter 75 mm height the in situ methods yielded values that were 10 800 times lower than the laboratory method young 1998 and regan 2000 measured ks values using vertical soil cores and the guelph permeameter respectively the in situ methods yielded values that were three to four times lower than the soil core ks measurements differences were attributed to continuous pores connecting the exposed surfaces of the cores for the laboratory method in this investigation the soil cube method provided further insight on the potential effect of anisotropic conditions on the comparison between ks measurements blanco canqui et al 2002 the anisotropy of ks was not substantial given that the difference between the ks v mcm and ks h mcm values was not statistically significant according to a two tailed student s t test p 0 05 dabney and selim 1987 the ratio between the mean values of ks v mcm and ks h mcm was equal to 0 97 table 3 in general the effect of allowing only one dimensional flow into the soil leads to an important error when the anisotropy is large and when no attempt is made to measure separately the horizontal and vertical components of permeability chappell and lancaster 2007 however the biasing problem on small soil cubes and the impossibility to sample all the macropores probably precluded the detection of the effect that macropores may exert on a specific flow direction indeed even if we explained the higher values of the mcm method in comparison to beerkan estimates obtained on the field based on the hypothesis of the activation of the macropore network we are not sure that this activation is complete in addition the size of the soil samples may not be large enough to sample the largest macropores encountered in the field in other words the measurement of the vertical and horizontal flow on small soil cubes may not be representative of the real anisotropic behavior of the macropore network that may occur at a larger scale in the field however we can consider that for the matrix alone the runs are representative of the field conditions therefore the result of a substantial isotropic behavior of the soil at the point scale suggested that the direction of the flow measurements i e vertical or horizontal did not play a role on ks estimation for the matrix at the small scale 3 2 comparing plot and point scale measurements fig 3 shows the subsurface flows measured for three different water table depths wtds for the four soil blocks the steady flow rates ranged from 3 4 10 4 to 4 4 10 2 l s 1 m 1 sample size n 12 thus yielding ks sb values that equaled 70 and 2157 mm h 1 table 4 for wtd25 and wtd5 respectively for wtd5 the mean ks sb value 1239 mm h 1 sample size n 4 was an order of magnitude higher than that elicited by the mcm therefore a smaller soil volume was found to be more homogeneous than a larger volume lai and ren 2007 macropore flow likely occurred at the sampled site since even the lowest mean of ks sb 724 mm h 1 was 4 3 times higher than those of the mcm known to overestimate the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the matrix see discussion above the discrepancy between the two spatial scales is even greater for the case of the beerkan runs therefore both laboratory and small scale field measurements yielded consistently lower values than those of the plot scale small scale measurements also yielded higher standard deviations sds and coefficient of variations cvs than those obtained on the soil blocks for wtd5 thus suggesting the degradation of sample representativeness at smaller scales in fact the variability of the data is expected to decrease as the size of the sampled soil volume increases angulo jaramillo et al 2016 conversely large soil volumes allowed the determination of representative ks sb values that account for soil heterogeneity and the contribution of the macropore network this result is also consistent with the suggestion of pachepsky and hill 2017 who stated that the macropore flow cannot be seen at the small scale but emerges and becomes of interest at the plot scale in other words the large volume of soil adequately embodied the macropore network blanco canqui et al 2002 day et al 1998 mendoza and steenhuis 2002 the relatively low variability of the data cv 48 6 also suggested the replicability of the measurements 3 3 lateral preferential flow the results from the comparison between plot and point scale measurements suggested that the studied soil was clearly made of two components namely the matrix and the macropore network that constituted a fast flow region in the following subsection we attempt to fully characterize both regions the matrix could be characterized by the values of saturated hydraulic conductivity obtained with beerkan runs the beerkan runs along with the four drainage experiments were used to estimate the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the fast flow region ks f mm h 1 using eq 5 the values of ks f ranged from 6 0 102 to 5 5 104 mm h 1 depending on the wtd and wf values table 5 for the lower 0 05 and upper 0 1 range values of wf the ks f estimates were in the range of two to three and one to three orders of magnitude higher than ks m respectively conversely differences never exceeding a factor of two were encountered for the ks f estimates within the selected wf ranges which may be considered within the natural range of spatial heterogeneity for the saturated hydraulic conductivity kodešová et al 2010 therefore because larger discrepancies occurred between the fast flow and the matrix regions it can be argued that the selected wf values had a lesser impact on the comparison between the km and kf values fig 6 shows the impact of wf on the ks f values estimated at different water table depths wtds for the four soil blocks firstly it should be taken into account that the global hydraulic conductivity was measured in the field and thus eq 5 was applied constraining ks 2 k values as shown in fig 6 ks f estimates decreased for higher wf values to explain this general trend we should consider that with the constrained ks 2 k value the increase of wf should correspond to a decrease in ks f estimates indeed the product of wf ks f that quantifies the contribution of the macropore network to the bulk hydraulic conductivity ks 2 k eq 4 must remain constant irrespective of the value of wf this condition is representative of a larger volume occupied by macropores which are in turn less connected and or with a smaller diameter corresponding to lower hydraulic conductivities on the contrary when wf decreases the increase in ks f is representative of a smaller volume occupied by more connected and or larger diameter macropores and a higher hydraulic conductivity in any case the contribution of the macropore network system remains constant moreover ks f estimates decreased for higher wtds i e for a thinner saturated soil layer with the exception of soil block 2 in this case a higher ks f value was estimated for wtd25 because of the effect of an open ended macropore biasing the matrix that was located at the bottom of the soil block this hypothesis was supported by field observations in particular during the saturation stage we observed water copiously flowing from a deep macropore this contributed to a higher ks f value than those obtained for lower wtds however as shown in fig 6 the overall decrease of ks f supported the hypothesis that the macropore density decreased with depth it can be argued that the sampled volume should be increased for lower horizons in order to adequately represent the macropore network in contrast the increase in wtd from 5 to 15 and to 25 cm resulted in a reduction of the sampled soil volume under such conditions the sampled volumes may have not been sufficient to activate the macropore networks located in the deeper horizons moreover the ks f variability increased abruptly for thinner saturated layers a smaller macropore density was noted as a function of depth that increased the macropore flow variability which may ultimately contribute to the explanation of the smaller transfer rates in the deeper horizons köhne et al 2009 these results implied that the proper scale to study macropore flow for small thickness of the saturated layer may be the hillslope scale on the studied hillslope this effect likely had a certain impact on the measurements for lower wtds thus resulting in a minor ks f overestimation in some circumstances owing to the occasional presence of deep open ended macropores soil block 2 notwithstanding this finding considering the entire volume of the soil blocks the water flow was mainly controlled by the dense macropore network which characterized the porous medium in proximity of the soil surface thus in these cases the effect of deep open ended macropores was less noticeable 4 conclusions this investigation was carried out to characterize the subsurface flow processes in a hillslope at different spatial scales namely at point and plot scale using the beerkan method with the best algorithm the mcm and the soil block method the differences between the considered scales were attributed mainly to the effect of the macropore flow and the impossibility to adequately embody the macropore network on small sampled soil volumes the comparison of ks measurement techniques allowed us to establish the peculiarity of each ks data obtained at a particular spatial scale this information helped establish the usability of a given technique to interpret or simulate a particular hydrological process in particular the scale dependence of ks essentially precluded the use of small scale measurements for detecting a dual permeability behavior otherwise plot scale measurements allowed us to obtain reliable estimates accounting for macropore flow in our study we clearly proved the advantage of experimental protocols based on multiscale experiments our results yielded encouraging evidence for the applicability of the soil block method at the plot scale along the beerkan infiltration runs at the point scale for a plausible estimation of the saturated hydraulic conductivities for the matrix and the fast flow region ks m and ks f using a relatively simple field procedure the use of expandable polyurethane foam as a suitable material to encase soil blocks for hydraulic conductivity measurements was successfully tested it closely adhered to the irregular soil surface brye et al 2004 germer and braun 2015 muller and hamilton 1992 avoided water loss and obtained accurate measurements of ks this is a promising result given that researcher studies should constantly focus their efforts to simplify field measurements alagna et al 2016 in the future the proposed methodology may be applied to explain saturation excess runoff i e saturation overland flow or to study subsurface macropore flow indeed these processes constitute the major mechanisms affecting the dynamics of the shallow groundwater perched table above a restrictive layer which is an integrated process that needs a minimum contributing area to be activated blöschl and sivapalan 1995 further experimental work is needed to determine the macropore domain wf based on this aim the fraction of the macropore domain in the dual permeability model could be estimated using micromorphological images kodešová et al 2009 this approach could allow us to estimate wf as the ratio of the porosity determined by image analysis and the overall porosity of the sampled soil the role of the macropores in controlling ks f at the studied hillslope needs to be further investigated for example tracer experiments may be carried out to investigate macroporosity extensions and connectivity ahuja et al 1995 köhne et al 2009 which was considered responsible for the detected scale dependence of

7163,this study focuses on the identification of the lateral preferential flow at the hillslope scale and the estimation of the saturated hydraulic conductivity for the fast flow region ks f based on infiltration experiments carried out at different spatial scales point and plot scales and at different soil depths the discrepancies between the considered scales were mainly attributed to macropore flow and the difficulty in adequately embodying the macropore network on small sampled soil volumes conversely at the plot scale the sampled volume was sufficient to activate the macropore network this information helped establish the usability of a given technique to determine the parameters describing the hydraulic properties of the soil in the matrix and fast flow regions while ks data obtained from the beerkan method with the beerkan estimation of soil transfer best parameter algorithm point scale were used to describe the matrix ks m the saturated hydraulic conductivity for the fast flow region was estimated using the soil block method plot scale estimated ks f values were one to three orders of magnitude higher than ks m the overall decrease of ks f with the soil depth supported the hypothesis that the macropore density decreased as a function of depth yielding higher macropore flow variability the soil block method in association with the beerkan infiltration runs allowed the estimation of the saturated hydraulic conductivity for the fast flow region based on a relatively simple field procedure keywords beerkan best algorithm in situ soil block method cube

hydrological cycle thus reducing the availability of water resources in many environments groppelli et al 2011 in semiarid and arid regions increasing demands on limited water supplies require urgent efforts to improve water quality and quantity by preserving and improving the groundwater recharge of surface water bodies scanlon et al 2006 recharge processes can be classified as uniform downward movements of water through the unsaturated zone piston flow and nonuniform downward water movement along more active pathways also referred to as preferential flow sukhija et al 2003 preferential flow can contribute to the rapid transport of contaminants from the soil surface into receiving streams bypassing the filtering capacity of the soil e g lamy et al 2009 lassabatere et al 2007 prédélus et al 2017 water flow may mainly occur via preferential flow paths blöschl and sivapalan 1995 especially at the hillslope scale therefore there is an urgent need to assess procedures and techniques for characterizing water transport in hillslopes especially when this transport appears to be affected by preferential flow paths which may be induced by structural cracks faunal activity or roots specific pedological conditions and soil management practices angulo jaramillo et al 2016 the saturated soil hydraulic conductivity ks exerts a dominating influence on the partitioning of rainfall in vertical and lateral flow paths dusek et al 2012 therefore estimates of ks are essential for describing and modeling hydrological processes niedda and pirastru 2013 zimmermann et al 2013 however this soil property may be scale dependent mainly owing to the soil structure preferential flow paths and heterogeneities whose effects cannot be observed and quantified in measurements conducted on small soil volumes in addition the scale dependence of flow and transport parameters essentially makes the use of parameters estimated through pedotransfer functions for numerical simulations impossible pachepsky et al 2014 the saturated hydraulic conductivity must be measured in the laboratory or field several studies have shown that the saturated soil hydraulic conductivity values ks measured on macroporous soils can vary over several orders of magnitude depending on the sampled soil volume chapuis et al 2005 for instance vepraskas and williams 1995 compared ks values using sample volumes equal to 3 5 10 4 6 3 10 3 and 6 8 10 1 m3 concluding that the minimum sample size needed in situ for ks measurements ought to be approximately equal to at least 5 10 3 m3 experiments used to determine ks values at different spatial scales were performed by chappell and lancaster 2007 these authors applied six field methods namely slug tests constant and falling head borehole permeameters a ring permeameter and two types of trench tests the ks values determined by the larger scale experiments i e the trench percolation tests were on average 37 times larger than the mean conductivity obtained by slug tests conducted using piezometers positioned near the trenches chappell and lancaster 2007 brooks et al 2004 discussed different reasons to explicate such a discrepancy for instance small samples may not adequately represent water transmission since smaller sampled volumes imply a smaller opportunity to include macropores zobeck et al 1985 in particular the extent of the macropores in the porous medium was considered as the main factor in determining the gap between measurements hillslope scale measurements overcome the lack of representativeness commonly encountered in small scale measurements and allow process characterization at the appropriate scale these types of measurements are therefore recommended for model calibration however the number of studies that have focused on the assessment of large scale experiments and their comparisons with smaller scale experiments have been limited among the studies that focused on large scale experiments those that have addressed preferential or macropore flows are particularly few montgomery and dietrich 1995 compared the hydraulic conductivity calculated from a gully head cut with those observed in falling head tests only the higher values obtained from this latter experiment approached the bulk conductivity measured from the gully head cut by integrating through and macropore flows brooks et al 2004 proposed a methodology to measure the lateral ks values at the top of an impeding layer at the hillslope scale their measurements yielded ks values from one to two orders of magnitude larger than those measured at small scales on small soil cores and by using the guelph permeameter the discrepancy between measurements at different spatial scales was greatest near the surface and was attributed to the effect of the macropores furthermore according to these authors more economical methods are needed to obtain spatially distributed ks data or for routine measurements brooks et al 2004 reliable ks values should be measured on a soil volume similar to the minimum representative elementary volume rev to incorporate the natural heterogeneity of the soil mendoza and steenhuis 2002 the rev is the smallest volume over which a measurement can be made to yield a representative value of the entire porous medium pachepsky and hill 2017 its size depends on the soil structural characteristics and it is expected to increase for decreasing macropore spatial densities thus in order to adequately represent the hydrological effects of the macropore network the rev should include a sufficient number of nodes and branches in such a way to representatively embody the macropore network topology since it may control scale dependencies the in situ block method day et al 1998 has proven to be a useful tool for saturated soil hydraulic conductivity measurements this technique consists of measuring water flow in situ on a large undisturbed soil block that seals the exposed sides in order to confine water flow for example day et al 1998 measured water flow on a 3 38 m3 soil block the block s vertical faces were sealed using bentonite sand and lumber blanco canqui et al 2002 evaluated ks on three in situ 0 029 m3 soil blocks enclosed by steel plates and inserted approximately 35 cm below the soil surface and on bentonite slurry to seal the soil steel plate interfaces mendoza and steenhuis 2002 developed and tested a hillslope infiltrometer to measure in situ vertical and lateral saturated soil hydraulic conductivity the hillslope infiltrometer is a metal box installed around an undisturbed 0 045 m3 soil block slightly smaller than the infiltrometer starr et al 2005 designed an in situ steel chamber for studying water flow under shallow water table and riparian zone conditions the chamber was lowered over a 0 97 m3 soil block however ks measurements on the soil block remain rare for the following reasons i the need for a sloping impermeable bed to avoid deep water percolation ii the need to encase a large soil volume with impermeable materials so that all terms of darcy s law can be unambiguously defined iii the need for a number of operators over the entire duration of the experiment and the iv the need of a large displacement of liquid to reach steady state conditions during flow measurements several studies have considered small scale measurements on macroporous soils including both laboratory and in situ tests akay et al 2008 these approaches are generally simpler and parsimonious in terms of the experimental devices and required measurements however small scale measurements may not adequately represent ks depending on whether water flows through a small fraction of the soil along preferential flow paths bouma et al 1977 or only through the matrix in fact at this scale macropores are hardly intercepted while their continuity at the larger scale is unknown beven and germann 1982 zobeck et al 1985 moreover the presence of aggregates stones fissures fractures tension cracks and root holes commonly encountered in unsaturated soil profiles is difficult to represent in small samples haverkamp et al 1999 the dual permeability approach has been developed for modeling and for quantifying preferential flow gerke et al 2015 šimůnek et al 2003 the dual permeability approach assumes that soils encompass two regions including the matrix and the fast flow regions that respectively host the smallest and the larger pores lassabatere et al 2014 used the dual permeability approach to model water infiltration below ponded and tension infiltrometers in heterogeneous soils at the hillslope scale dusek et al 2012 studied the preferential flow effects on the subsurface runoff by combining a one dimensional 1d vertical dual continuum approach with a 1d lateral flow equation more recently different innovative approaches were proposed for dual and multiple permeability medium characterizations for instance abou najm and atallah 2016 proposed a new method to experimentally characterize porous media by using newtonian and non newtonian fluids lassabatere et al 2014 proposed the best 2 k method for hydraulic characterization of dual permeability media on the infiltration data acquired on the field however all these methods need to be further developed and tested to address processes at the small scale i e maximum meter scale the objective of this research was to characterize and quantify a lateral preferential flow at the hillslope scale for this purpose we considered the double permeability approach concomitancy of fast flow and matrix regions and estimated the saturated hydraulic conductivities of both fast flow and matrix regions ks f and ks m by coupling data from the infiltration experiments carried out at different spatial scales namely at point and plot scales specifically we combined the following experiments i in situ small scale measures of soil vertical hydraulic conductivity using the beerkan method ii laboratory small scale measures of vertical and horizontal hydraulic conductivity using the modified cube method and iii plot scale measure of lateral hydraulic conductivity using in situ soil blocks we assumed that beerkan runs would help the determination of the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the matrix and the modified cube method in the determination of the vertical and horizontal hydraulic conductivity of the soil these measures are then used to analyze the observed flow through the soil blocks and to identify and quantify the contribution of the matrix and the macropore network to the total lateral flux as a function of the volume of the soil block that is submitted to lateral flow 2 material and methods 2 1 study site description the study area consists of a north facing steep slope side located in the baratz lake basin niedda et al 2014 on sardinia s north west coast in italy 40 69825 n 8 2346 e wgs84 the site features a semiarid mediterranean climate with a mild winter warm summer and a high water deficit between april and september the mean annual temperature is 15 8 c the average annual precipitation is approximately 600 mm mainly concentrated from autumn to spring the potential evapotranspiration is approximately 1000 mm year 1 the experimental hillslope has elevations ranging from 51 to 65 m a s l and it is approximately 60 m long and with an average slope of 30 while the incoming surface and subsurface flows are diverted by the ditches on both sides of a road at the upper end the hillslope is drained by the main stream channel of the catchment at the toe the hillslope soil was classified as a lithic haploxerepts soil survey staff 2006 its profile is approximately 0 3 0 4 m deep the soil horizons include a bw and c pirastru et al 2014 the latter is a dense altered substratum of permian sandstone which exhibits very low permeability castellini et al 2016 during the rainy season a perched water table and lateral subsurface flow were observed owing to the presence of this restrictive layer in terms of vegetation the experimental area is covered with spontaneous grass grown after the clearing of the mediterranean maquis and deep moldboard ploughing the conversion into grassland took place approximately 15 years ago in order to create a 15 m wide firebreak the area has remained almost unmanaged ever since 2 2 soil sampling soil samples were collected at depths of 0 5 10 20 cm in particular undisturbed soil cores 0 05 m in height and 0 05 m in diameter were collected at randomly sampled points and were used to determine both the soil bulk density ρb g cm 3 and the initial volumetric soil water content θi cm3cm 3 the soil porosity was calculated from the ρb data assuming a soil particle density of 2 65 g cm 3 according to other investigations the field s saturated soil water content θs cm3cm 3 was equal to the porosity di prima et al 2018 mubarak et al 2009 disturbed soil samples were also collected inside the confined soil after each ponding infiltration runs and was used 50 g for each sample to determine the particle size distribution based on conventional methods following h2o2 pretreatment to eliminate organic matter and clay deflocculation using sodium metaphosphate and mechanical agitation gee and bauder 1986 in particular fine size fractions were determined using the hydrometer method whereas the coarse fractions were obtained by mechanical dry sieving according to usda standards the soil of the studied area was classified as sandy loam according to shirazi and boersma 1984 the geometric mean particle diameter was also estimated table 1 summarizes the physical parameters of the soil at the studied hillslope 2 3 in situ block method the soil block method aimed at including the lateral component of the preferential flow at the plot scale for lateral ks measurements more details on the soil block preparation can be found in di prima et al 2017b and pirastru et al 2017 at first four soil blocks with dimensions of 50 cm width by 105 cm length by 70 cm depth were obtained by careful hand digging of trenches with widths of 20 cm surrounding each soil block since the interface between the upper horizons and the restrictive substratum was located at a depth of approximately 38 cm the excavated soil blocks consisted of layered blocks and included the upper a and bw horizons and approximately 32 cm of impeding substratum no evidence of man made cracks was observed during the excavation process expandable polyurethane foam was then injected into the trench volumes in order to encase the exposed soil blocks this inert material is not expected to alter the chemical lewis et al 1990 and physical bagarello and sgroi 2008 characteristics of the soil and it concurrently prevents edge flows germer and braun 2015 after the foam was completely dried two pits were excavated up to the depth of the soil substratum interface in order to expose the up and downhill faces of the soil block and to create inflow ip and outflow pits op respectively at the end the resulting soil blocks hereafter referred to as sbs were associated with a geometrically calculated volume above the impeding layer that ranged from 0 100 to 0 163 m3 each drainage experiment consisted of four stages after a first satiation stage three water table depths wtds fig 1 were sequentially settled at 5 15 and 25 cm below the soil surface in the ip with a custom built mariotte bottle the large 50 l capacity of the bottle avoided the need of frequent refilling throughout the duration of the executed stages each imposed water table depth was maintained until the achievement of quasi steady state conditions a syphon system was used to impose from time to time the same water table depths in the op during these processing stages visual readings of the water level in the bottle were used to calculate the inflow rates as obtained through a liquid level gauge the excess water flowing from the op through the syphon system was measured by weighting the collected water volumes fig 2 depicts the experimental setup the total run duration varied between 260 and 460 min depending on the run a first attempt to measure outflow from the op was carried out using a 4 cm diameter pvc pipe used as a spillway at the downhill side the pipes were inserted in the dried foam at a smooth slope in order to maintain a constant water level and to divert the excess volume for collection this procedure was applied only on the sb1 because field observations revealed that the pipe installations produced a slight discontinuity between soil and foam thus resulting in leakages to avoid such a problem the syphon system was used for the other soil blocks fig 2 therefore for these latter experiments the water loss was small thus yielding similar inflow and outflow measurements fig 3 however in the third and fourth sbs the same differences between inflow and outflow rates were detected for wtd25 in particular water draining from progressive desaturation of the upper soil volume i e the layer that had a depth that ranged between 15 and 25 cm initially contributed to yield higher outflows during this stage the desaturation of the upper soil volume did not affect the inflow rates since the flow zone was already saturated during the previous stages of the experiment this difference was not observed in the sb2 experiment probably owing to the higher measured flow rates fig 3 therefore for the 2nd 3rd and 4th drainage experiments the outflows measured under quasi steady state conditions were used to estimate the lateral saturated soil hydraulic conductivity of the soil blocks ks sb mm h 1 according to darcy s formula as follows 1 k s s b q t s δ z where q l2t 1 is the flow of water per unit width of the block t l is the thickness of the flow zone measured perpendicular to the bed z l is the water table elevation from an arbitrary datum and s l is the distance measured on a straight line in the direction of the sloping bed in this investigation q t s and δz were measured during the field experiment or were determined using a simple geometry fig 1 we decided to use measured inflows rather than outflows only for the first sb1 experiment because i field observations during this experiment revealed localized water leakages from the op and the measured inflow was thus completely infiltrated through the sb1 and ii the measured inflow of the first experiment was consistent with the other ones 2 4 modified cube method the horizontal and vertical hydraulic conductivities of the saturated soil ks were determined based on the modified cube method mcm beckwith et al 2003 to gain insight on the potential effects of anisotropic conditions on the comparison between the ks measurements blanco canqui et al 2002 in fact the presence of layers parallel to the soil surface is expected to induce effective horizontal ks values that are greater than the vertical ones zaslavsky and rogowski 1969 according to the procedure described by bagarello and sgroi 2008 and bagarello et al 2009 a total of 20 soil cubes were collected at depths that ranged between 0 and 11 cm by carefully carving out 11 cm width by 11 cm length by 14 cm depth soil prisms fig 4 a a wooden box side length 17 cm that was open at the bottom and top sides was placed around each exposed soil prism fig 4b expandable polyurethane foam was injected between the box and the exposed soil and on the soil surface fig 4c to avoid foam adhesion and to facilitate reusing the box was wrapped with plastic wrap in order to confine the foam expansion a wood was positioned on the top of the box fig 4d after the total expansion of the foam the excess was cut off with a knife and the cube was marked to preserve direction a layer of soil with a 3 cm thickness was removed from the bottom of the prism to obtain a cubic soil sample finally the sample was completely encased by applying the foam at the bottom side in the laboratory the vertical conductivity ks v mcm was measured for ten randomly chosen cubes the cubes were taken from the wooden box and the foam was removed from the top and bottom faces using a knife the horizontal conductivity ks h mcm was measured for the remaining soil cubes in this latter case the foam was removed from the up and downhill faces of the cube for each cube a single measurement was carried out given that the first measurement may affect the second when bidirectional measurements are performed on a single soil cube bagarello et al 2009 a wire net was placed at the bottom face of the cube to support the weight of the soil the soil samples were then slowly saturated from the bottom for 24 h the constant head laboratory permeameter method klute and dirksen 1986 with an established ponding depth of 1 cm was applied to measure ks according to darcy s law a syphon was used to maintain the constant depth of ponding on the soil surface the use of a mariotte bottle with small ponding depths was avoided since it may promote turbulence close to the soil s surface potentially resulting in clogging the exposed pores bagarello et al 2009 the constant head permeameter used for measuring ks v mcm and ks h mcm was operated with water that flowed from the top and the uphill cube faces respectively the experiments were carried out until steady state conditions were established i e at approximately 30 95 min depending on the run the last 10 35 min of the measured flow rate data were used to calculate ks finally for each measurement direction the ten determinations of ks were averaged and the ratio ks h mcm ks v mcm was evaluated to check the occurrence of anisotropy i e the prevalence of the vertical ks h mcm ks v mcm 1 or horizontal ks h mcm ks v mcm 1 flow directions beckwith et al 2003 the chosen sample size n 10 was expected to yield representative mean ks v and ks l values at the scale considered in this investigation reynolds et al 2002 2 5 best method the beerkan estimation of the soil transfer best parameter method for soil hydraulic characterization introduced by lassabatere et al 2006 was chosen for this investigation to yield an estimate for the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the matrix since it constitutes a practical alternative to more cumbersome and time consuming methods bagarello et al 2014a indeed this method needs simple equipment and minimal field work and it is gaining popularity in soil science a total of 40 ponding infiltration runs of the beerkan type were carried out at the depths of 0 5 10 and 20 cm ten for each soil depth at randomly selected points of the hillslope a small diameter ring i e 8 cm inserted at a depth of 1 cm was used the soil disturbance was minimized by the limited ring insertion depth alagna et al 2013 a relatively small ring diameter was chosen since the total sampled area cannot be too large given that the ring had to be inserted on a sloping surface angulo jaramillo et al 2016 and to avoid the sampling of the macropore network for each run 15 water volumes each equal to 43 ml were successively poured on the confined infiltration surface the number of infiltrated volumes was sufficient to reach steady state as required by the beerkan methods lassabatere et al 2006 the energy of the falling water was dissipated with the hand fingers to minimize the soil disturbance owing to water pouring as commonly suggested e g alagna et al 2017 castellini et al 2018 di prima et al 2017a reynolds 1993 for each water volume the time needed for the water to infiltrate was logged and the cumulative infiltration i mm was plotted against time t s a regression line was then fitted to the last data points to describe the steady state conditions to estimate the experimental steady state infiltration rate is mm h 1 and the associated intercept bs mm the steady algorithm of best bagarello et al 2014b was then applied to estimate the saturated soil hydraulic conductivity ks best mm h 1 based on the following equation di prima et al 2016 2 k s b e s t c i s a b s c where the constants a mm 1 and c are defined as follows haverkamp et al 1994 3a a γ r θ s θ i 3b c 1 2 1 θ i θ s η 1 β ln 1 β where θi and θs refer to the initial and saturated water contents respectively γ parameter for geometrical correction of the infiltration front shape and β are the coefficients that are commonly set at 0 75 and 0 6 r mm is the radius of the disk source and η is a shape parameter that is estimated from the analysis of the particle size data with the pedotransfer function included in the best procedure lassabatere et al 2006 more details on the methods and the validation of equations based on fitted experimental data can be found in di prima et al 2016 and lassabatere et al 2009 in this investigation the best steady algorithm was chosen since it yields higher percentage of success i e positive ks values on the infiltration runs and allows simple calculation of ks as compared to other best algorithms namely best intercept yilmaz et al 2010 and best slope lassabatere et al 2006 2 6 dual permeability approach on the basis of the measures obtained from the beerkan runs and the block method it was expected that the hydraulic conductivity of macropores would be efficiently computed for dual permeability systems it is considered that the global hydraulic conductivity ks 2 k mm h 1 can be decoupled in terms of its contributions to the matrix and to the fast flow region gerke and van genuchten 1993 4 k s 2 k w f k s f 1 w f k s m where wf is the void ratio occupied by the fast flow region dimensionless i e the ratio of the volumes of the macropore and total flow regions and ks f and ks m mm h 1 are the saturated hydraulic conductivities for the fast flow and the matrix regions respectively in this investigation we assumed that we had an estimate for the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the matrix from the beerkan runs if we also assume that ks 2 k can be estimated by the bulk values obtained based on drainage experiments we can deduce the hydraulic conductivity of the fast flow region using eq 4 and its solution for ks f which leads to 5 k s f k s 2 k 1 w f k s m w f since the void ratio occupied by the fast flow region was unknown we have evaluated multiple scenarios with wf values ranging from 0 05 to 0 1 i e the fast flow region was considered to occupy 5 10 of the entire region this range was adopted since the fast flow fraction generally occupied a very small fraction of the soil s porosity bouma et al 1977 moreover these values were selected to agree with those reported by many dual permeability applications for instance dusek et al 2012 settled the wf values to 7 and 5 at the soil surface and at a 75 cm depth respectively in a hillslope covered with grass calamagrostis villosa and spruce picea abies for numerical simulations lassabatere et al 2014 considered a value of 10 for wf 2 7 data analyses ks data were assumed to be log normally distributed since the statistical distribution of these data is generally log normal lee et al 1985 warrick 1998 therefore the geometric mean mg and the associated standard deviation sd and coefficient of variation cv were calculated using the appropriate log normal equations lee et al 1985 the arithmetic mean ma was calculated for ρb θi and θs statistical comparison between the two sets of data was conducted using two tailed student s t tests whereas the tukey s honestly significant test was applied to compare three or more datasets the ln ks data were considered for comparative purposes since ks was better described by the log normal distribution than the normal distribution an updated version of the workbook by di prima 2013 was used to analyze the beerkan infiltration runs by the best steady algorithm all statistical analyses were carried out using the minitab computer program minitab inc state college pa usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 in situ and laboratory small scale measurements our results show that the ks values estimated with the beerkan method ks best progressively decreased with soil depth fig 5 a and table 2 from a statistical point of view results of the tukey s honestly significant difference test showed significant differences between the ks values measured at different soil depths the dry soil bulk density ρb ranged between 1 44 and 1 78 g cm 3 n 12 no differences were detected along the soil profile in terms of ρb table 1 conversely the ks best values increased with the sand content pearson s correlation coefficients r 0 471 p 0 002 and decreased with the clay content r 0 606 p 0 001 fig 5b the higher percentage of coarse particles in the upper soil layer could suggest a certain rigidity of the porous medium table 1 on the contrary the increase in clay particles with soil depth implies more opportunities for clogging the largest pores and thus lower ks values in the upper soil these values were very close to the prediction of saturated conductivity from soil textural characteristics e g ks 44 2 mm h 1 for a sandy loam soil according to carsel and parrish 1988 therefore the macroporosity did not likely influence the measured infiltration process in general isolated macropores are physically difficult to include in the sampled volume brooks et al 2004 using small rings in the soils with macropores with ring inner diameters of 8 cm in this investigation implies a relatively high probability to sample only the soil matrix this yields a measurement of ks that is representative only of the matrix instead of the entire system of macropores angulo jaramillo et al 2016 in addition using small rings also implies fewer opportunities of inclusion of continuous macropores intersecting the confined soil surface large rings appear more appropriate than small rings in eliciting a signal associated with the occurrence of soil macropores or fast flow regions in the field since smaller soil volumes are functionally more homogeneous than larger volumes bagarello et al 2013 castellini et al 2016 applied the beerkan method using a ring with an inner diameter of 15 cm to assess the physical quality of the upper soil of the same experimental hillslope these authors obtained similar results for ks mean 24 1 mm h 1 coefficient of variation cv 118 the mean ks values collected during the two sampling campaigns differed by a factor of 1 8 this could be considered practically negligible for many hydrological applications elrick and reynolds 1992 table 3 summarizes the parameters obtained by the modified cube method mcm the means of ks were equal to 173 0 and 167 1 mm h 1 for the vertical and horizontal directions respectively the mcm yielded statistically different and higher ks estimates than beerkan the comparison between these methods requires additional considerations that are discussed below in situ ks measurements allow the maintenance of the functional connections of the sampled volumes with the surrounding matrix e g bagarello et al 2017 bouma 1982 di prima 2015 lauren et al 1988 in comparison in the laboratory the overall connection of extracted soil samples is expected to be higher because of the increased probability of their impact by macropores and the interception of the edges of the extracted samples we thus conclude that the higher values of saturated hydraulic conductivity for the mcm method results from a partial activation of the largest pores in the soil samples this increase in connectivity was discussed in detail in a review article by pachepsky and hill 2017 to explain this effect these authors considered data from one dimensional vertical water flow experiments in these experiments ks decreased with increases of the soil column length l according to the following power law ks l m anderson and bouma 1973 attributed this effect to the increasing probability that pores will remain connected throughout the length of a core as a function of decreasing core lengths in particular for longer samples the water flux appears to be controlled by a more homogeneous soil matrix with lower hydraulic conductivity values the process discussed above essentially mimics what happens during the beerkan infiltration runs which allow the preservation of the functional connection of the sampled volume with the surrounding matrix thus yielding lower ks values than those obtained with the mcm samples biased by pores several examples of the overestimation of ks on extracted soil samples can be found in the literature for instance the increase in ks owing to open ended pores on undisturbed soil samples was assessed by blanco canqui et al 2002 these authors measured ks on 180 soil cores with 76 mm diameter 76 mm height with and without bentonite to seal the macropores these authors found that ks values without bentonite were approximately four times higher than the corresponding ks values with bentonite kanwar et al 1989 compared the ks values determined in situ using the guelph permeameter device reynolds and elrick 2005 and the velocity permeameter merva 1979 with those obtained in the laboratory based on the constant head permeameter method on undisturbed soil cores 75 mm diameter 75 mm height the in situ methods yielded values that were 10 800 times lower than the laboratory method young 1998 and regan 2000 measured ks values using vertical soil cores and the guelph permeameter respectively the in situ methods yielded values that were three to four times lower than the soil core ks measurements differences were attributed to continuous pores connecting the exposed surfaces of the cores for the laboratory method in this investigation the soil cube method provided further insight on the potential effect of anisotropic conditions on the comparison between ks measurements blanco canqui et al 2002 the anisotropy of ks was not substantial given that the difference between the ks v mcm and ks h mcm values was not statistically significant according to a two tailed student s t test p 0 05 dabney and selim 1987 the ratio between the mean values of ks v mcm and ks h mcm was equal to 0 97 table 3 in general the effect of allowing only one dimensional flow into the soil leads to an important error when the anisotropy is large and when no attempt is made to measure separately the horizontal and vertical components of permeability chappell and lancaster 2007 however the biasing problem on small soil cubes and the impossibility to sample all the macropores probably precluded the detection of the effect that macropores may exert on a specific flow direction indeed even if we explained the higher values of the mcm method in comparison to beerkan estimates obtained on the field based on the hypothesis of the activation of the macropore network we are not sure that this activation is complete in addition the size of the soil samples may not be large enough to sample the largest macropores encountered in the field in other words the measurement of the vertical and horizontal flow on small soil cubes may not be representative of the real anisotropic behavior of the macropore network that may occur at a larger scale in the field however we can consider that for the matrix alone the runs are representative of the field conditions therefore the result of a substantial isotropic behavior of the soil at the point scale suggested that the direction of the flow measurements i e vertical or horizontal did not play a role on ks estimation for the matrix at the small scale 3 2 comparing plot and point scale measurements fig 3 shows the subsurface flows measured for three different water table depths wtds for the four soil blocks the steady flow rates ranged from 3 4 10 4 to 4 4 10 2 l s 1 m 1 sample size n 12 thus yielding ks sb values that equaled 70 and 2157 mm h 1 table 4 for wtd25 and wtd5 respectively for wtd5 the mean ks sb value 1239 mm h 1 sample size n 4 was an order of magnitude higher than that elicited by the mcm therefore a smaller soil volume was found to be more homogeneous than a larger volume lai and ren 2007 macropore flow likely occurred at the sampled site since even the lowest mean of ks sb 724 mm h 1 was 4 3 times higher than those of the mcm known to overestimate the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the matrix see discussion above the discrepancy between the two spatial scales is even greater for the case of the beerkan runs therefore both laboratory and small scale field measurements yielded consistently lower values than those of the plot scale small scale measurements also yielded higher standard deviations sds and coefficient of variations cvs than those obtained on the soil blocks for wtd5 thus suggesting the degradation of sample representativeness at smaller scales in fact the variability of the data is expected to decrease as the size of the sampled soil volume increases angulo jaramillo et al 2016 conversely large soil volumes allowed the determination of representative ks sb values that account for soil heterogeneity and the contribution of the macropore network this result is also consistent with the suggestion of pachepsky and hill 2017 who stated that the macropore flow cannot be seen at the small scale but emerges and becomes of interest at the plot scale in other words the large volume of soil adequately embodied the macropore network blanco canqui et al 2002 day et al 1998 mendoza and steenhuis 2002 the relatively low variability of the data cv 48 6 also suggested the replicability of the measurements 3 3 lateral preferential flow the results from the comparison between plot and point scale measurements suggested that the studied soil was clearly made of two components namely the matrix and the macropore network that constituted a fast flow region in the following subsection we attempt to fully characterize both regions the matrix could be characterized by the values of saturated hydraulic conductivity obtained with beerkan runs the beerkan runs along with the four drainage experiments were used to estimate the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the fast flow region ks f mm h 1 using eq 5 the values of ks f ranged from 6 0 102 to 5 5 104 mm h 1 depending on the wtd and wf values table 5 for the lower 0 05 and upper 0 1 range values of wf the ks f estimates were in the range of two to three and one to three orders of magnitude higher than ks m respectively conversely differences never exceeding a factor of two were encountered for the ks f estimates within the selected wf ranges which may be considered within the natural range of spatial heterogeneity for the saturated hydraulic conductivity kodešová et al 2010 therefore because larger discrepancies occurred between the fast flow and the matrix regions it can be argued that the selected wf values had a lesser impact on the comparison between the km and kf values fig 6 shows the impact of wf on the ks f values estimated at different water table depths wtds for the four soil blocks firstly it should be taken into account that the global hydraulic conductivity was measured in the field and thus eq 5 was applied constraining ks 2 k values as shown in fig 6 ks f estimates decreased for higher wf values to explain this general trend we should consider that with the constrained ks 2 k value the increase of wf should correspond to a decrease in ks f estimates indeed the product of wf ks f that quantifies the contribution of the macropore network to the bulk hydraulic conductivity ks 2 k eq 4 must remain constant irrespective of the value of wf this condition is representative of a larger volume occupied by macropores which are in turn less connected and or with a smaller diameter corresponding to lower hydraulic conductivities on the contrary when wf decreases the increase in ks f is representative of a smaller volume occupied by more connected and or larger diameter macropores and a higher hydraulic conductivity in any case the contribution of the macropore network system remains constant moreover ks f estimates decreased for higher wtds i e for a thinner saturated soil layer with the exception of soil block 2 in this case a higher ks f value was estimated for wtd25 because of the effect of an open ended macropore biasing the matrix that was located at the bottom of the soil block this hypothesis was supported by field observations in particular during the saturation stage we observed water copiously flowing from a deep macropore this contributed to a higher ks f value than those obtained for lower wtds however as shown in fig 6 the overall decrease of ks f supported the hypothesis that the macropore density decreased with depth it can be argued that the sampled volume should be increased for lower horizons in order to adequately represent the macropore network in contrast the increase in wtd from 5 to 15 and to 25 cm resulted in a reduction of the sampled soil volume under such conditions the sampled volumes may have not been sufficient to activate the macropore networks located in the deeper horizons moreover the ks f variability increased abruptly for thinner saturated layers a smaller macropore density was noted as a function of depth that increased the macropore flow variability which may ultimately contribute to the explanation of the smaller transfer rates in the deeper horizons köhne et al 2009 these results implied that the proper scale to study macropore flow for small thickness of the saturated layer may be the hillslope scale on the studied hillslope this effect likely had a certain impact on the measurements for lower wtds thus resulting in a minor ks f overestimation in some circumstances owing to the occasional presence of deep open ended macropores soil block 2 notwithstanding this finding considering the entire volume of the soil blocks the water flow was mainly controlled by the dense macropore network which characterized the porous medium in proximity of the soil surface thus in these cases the effect of deep open ended macropores was less noticeable 4 conclusions this investigation was carried out to characterize the subsurface flow processes in a hillslope at different spatial scales namely at point and plot scale using the beerkan method with the best algorithm the mcm and the soil block method the differences between the considered scales were attributed mainly to the effect of the macropore flow and the impossibility to adequately embody the macropore network on small sampled soil volumes the comparison of ks measurement techniques allowed us to establish the peculiarity of each ks data obtained at a particular spatial scale this information helped establish the usability of a given technique to interpret or simulate a particular hydrological process in particular the scale dependence of ks essentially precluded the use of small scale measurements for detecting a dual permeability behavior otherwise plot scale measurements allowed us to obtain reliable estimates accounting for macropore flow in our study we clearly proved the advantage of experimental protocols based on multiscale experiments our results yielded encouraging evidence for the applicability of the soil block method at the plot scale along the beerkan infiltration runs at the point scale for a plausible estimation of the saturated hydraulic conductivities for the matrix and the fast flow region ks m and ks f using a relatively simple field procedure the use of expandable polyurethane foam as a suitable material to encase soil blocks for hydraulic conductivity measurements was successfully tested it closely adhered to the irregular soil surface brye et al 2004 germer and braun 2015 muller and hamilton 1992 avoided water loss and obtained accurate measurements of ks this is a promising result given that researcher studies should constantly focus their efforts to simplify field measurements alagna et al 2016 in the future the proposed methodology may be applied to explain saturation excess runoff i e saturation overland flow or to study subsurface macropore flow indeed these processes constitute the major mechanisms affecting the dynamics of the shallow groundwater perched table above a restrictive layer which is an integrated process that needs a minimum contributing area to be activated blöschl and sivapalan 1995 further experimental work is needed to determine the macropore domain wf based on this aim the fraction of the macropore domain in the dual permeability model could be estimated using micromorphological images kodešová et al 2009 this approach could allow us to estimate wf as the ratio of the porosity determined by image analysis and the overall porosity of the sampled soil the role of the macropores in controlling ks f at the studied hillslope needs to be further investigated for example tracer experiments may be carried out to investigate macroporosity extensions and connectivity ahuja et al 1995 köhne et al 2009 which was considered responsible for the detected scale dependence of

keywords storm hydrology geomorphology continental scale teleconnections soil parent material 1 introduction stormflow or quickflow is the non baseflow component of a hydrograph following a precipitation event hewlett and hibbert 1967 while precipitation and antecedent moisture conditions intensity duration and spatial distribution are the main drivers of stormflow bracken and croke 2007 the relative amount of stormflow and the flashiness of the discharge produced by a watershed is a function of watershed morphology and land cover generally runoff will be greater in watersheds that have steep slopes and high relative relief sidle et al 2000 rose and peters 2001 montgomery and dietrich 2002 jackson et al 2014 when antecedent moisture conditions are high the importance of slope to runoff creation often increases because infiltrated subsurface flow is forced to flow parallel to the ground surface by a saturated zone or a relatively impermeable layer montgomery and dietrich 2002 jackson et al 2014 disturbance of the natural landscape can also increase the relative amount of stormflow and the flashiness of the discharge produced by a watershed knox 1977 hollis 1979 disturbed

the disturbance but also its pattern jones et al 2000 carle et al 2005 alberti et al 2007 buchanan et al 2013 these studies have shown that relatively small portions of a watershed e g roads and agricultural drainage ditches can have an inordinately large impact on storm discharge by increasing the hydrologic connectivity of the landscape and bypassing groundwater flow this study focuses on water years 1986 through 2006 due to the length and completeness of the usgs gage records in the southern blue ridge mountains fig 1 this research determined how low amounts of development 15 and pastoral activities 20 influence the amount and character of stormflow relative to baseflow and total discharge and the flashiness of flow in the southern blue ridge mountains sbrm we hypothesized that watershed morphometry would explain the majority of the variance in the amount and character of stormflow between the study watersheds smaller steeper watersheds were expected to have greater amounts of stormflow and much flashier flow compared to larger watersheds with lower slopes additionally we hypothesized that especially during dry years watersheds with greater amounts of pasture and low to moderate amounts of development in the alluvial bottomlands will have flashier flows and produce more stormflow because the landscape favors runoff over infiltration research in the upper little tennessee river valley of western north carolina suggests that at least under drought conditions baseflow was significantly lower in pastured versus forested watersheds price et al 2011 these differences in baseflow were attributed to the lower infiltration rates of compacted pasture soils versus lower bulk density forest soils price et al 2010 however examining hydrograph characteristics across this same region jackson et al 2017 found that evidence of land use s influence on suspended sediment concentrations was overshadowed by regional differences in precipitation across watersheds to account for precipitation differences across the region the study was constrained to the winter season december through march when frontal systems bring more uniform distributions of precipitation gamble and meentemeyer 1997 climatically similar periods average dry wet years were subset and analyzed separately so that the large differences in precipitation between wet and dry years would not overshadow the potential influence of land use land cover soil parent material specific percentages of land cover were compared to general watershed scale percentages to determine if land cover near the stream network alluvium colluvium or on hillslopes saprolite residuum explain more variance than the general watershed scale percentages road coverages were also added to the land cover dataset to provide a metric that represents the road network enhanced hilltop and hillslope connectivity to the stream network analyzing land cover percentages on spatially discrete portions of the landscape on alluvium colluvium or saprolite residuum during climatically similar years allowed for a better understanding of how stormflow and flashiness may be affected by various scenarios of development and or

annual variability in temperature and precipitation in the eastern united states ropelewski and halpert 1986 hartley 1999 henderson and robinson 1994 in light of these findings we hypothesized that the majority of the inter annual variation in stormflow will be explained by fluctuations in continental scale teleconnections this research determined 1 the amount of variance that is explained by climate basin morphology and land use land cover 2 whether soil parent material specific percentages of land cover explain more variance than generalized watershed scale percentages and 3 the role of continental scale teleconnections and land cover during periods of wetness dryness this work was motivated by the need to better understand the drivers of hydrologic variation in meso scale montane watersheds 2 study area the geology of the sbrm consists of a northeast trending middle proterozoic granitic gneiss core that is unconformably overlain on each flank by younger proterozoic and early paleozoic quartz diorite and biotite gneiss with scattered pockets of amphibolite robinson et al 1992 overlying the bedrock is a thick mantle up to 30 m of highly weathered residuum southworth et al 2003 this residuum contributes significant quantities of fine sediment to the valley bottoms through colluvial and fluvial transport processes price and leigh 2006 the geomorphology of the region is dominated by colluvial processes in the headwaters phillips 2002 and alluvial colluvial fans mixing with the dominantly fluvial higher order alluvial bottomlands leigh 2010 mcdonald and leigh 2014 although elevations are typically higher in the northern and northeastern portion of the sbrm mean annual rainfall generally decreases from the southwest to the northeast due to orographic lifting and rain out effects as storm systems move from the ridge and valley and piedmont into the highlands of the sbrm fig 1 regionally interactions between oceanic and continental air masses bring frontal

developments will grow to suburban or urban densities within the next twenty years and up to 67 of new buildings will be built within forested areas kirk et al 2012 while the influences that traditional land use and exurbanization have on water quality and baseflow have been studied sutherland et al 2002 price et al 2011 webster et al 2012 their influence on stormflow has not yet been examined 3 data and methods 3 1 selection of usgs gages out of the approximately 250 usgs gaged watersheds in the sbrm 15 watersheds were selected fig 1 that met the following criteria 1 drainage areas between 30 and 800 km2 to target non headwater wadeable streams 2 lacked large impoundments that would attenuate flood peaks and 3 had near continuous at least 15 complete winter seasons daily discharge data from 1986 2006 table 1 is a list of the independent climatic geomorphic and land cover variables and dependent hydrologic variables used in this analysis data sources and the methods used to process the data are described in detail below 3 2 climate analysis intentionally focused on the winter months december through march because of the relatively uniform spatial distribution of precipitation that frontal systems have on the sbrm during this season due to the regional focus of this study and because each watershed did not have a climate station monthly prism parameter elevation relationships on independent slopes model data from the oregon climate group were used to obtain monthly and seasonal estimates of precipitation for each watershed prism 2014 these monthly estimates of precipitation were determined using a watershed area weighted average from the 4 km prism dataset table 1 indices of the north atlantic oscillation nao pacific north american pattern pna and el nino southern oscillation enso were downloaded from the national weather service s climate prediction center http www cpc ncep noaa gov these three indices were chosen because previous research found a strong relationship between these three indices and inter annual variations in temperature and precipitation in the eastern united states henderson and robinson 1994 found that during a positive pna upper level meridional flows tended to reduce the number of precipitation events but was also often related to relatively large events when they did happen their study also found that during a negative pna upper level zonal flows tended to bring more precipitation events but these events are often more clustered and smaller conversely nao has been found to be positively correlated with temperature and precipitation in the southeastern us hartley 1999 this positive correlation is caused by an increased zonal pressure gradient across the northern atlantic creating conditions where warmer wetter air advects into the eastern us hurrell and dickson 2004 ropelewski and halpert 1986 found that in the southeastern united states the majority of el nino la nina events were associated with lower higher temperatures and higher lower amounts of precipitation these temperature and precipitation differences are likely caused by a displacement of storm tracks eastward or westward during el nino or la nina events respectively eichler and higgins 2006 the teleconnection indices were classified by water year oct 1 sept 30 and winter season means were calculated and included as additional independent variables in order to determine how nao pna and enso affects the inter monthly character of precipitation in the region daily precipitation records were obtained from the available long term climate stations in the region that had mostly complete records from 1986 to 2006 fig 1 for each climate station total seasonal precipitation and number of peaks were calculated using base r r core team 2017 peaks were defined as any peak in daily precipitation that was larger than the day before as well as the day after storms were separated using the datacombine package in r gandrund 2016 the datacombine package separates periods of precipitation from quiescent periods storms were defined as any period of precipitation the contribution of the largest storm to total precipitation was analyzed by dividing the largest storm of the winter season by total seasonal precipitation during that season max storm of total periods of wetness dryness were subdivided based on z scores of regional average total winter precipitation z scores were used to determine climatic periods rather than one of the palmer drought indices because z scores provide a short term indicator of wetness or dryness tailored to the data using the prism dataset total seasonal precipitation was calculated for each winter season 1986 2006 for each watershed a regional average of total winter precipitation for the 15 watersheds was used to calculate the z scores years with a z score between 0 5 and 0 5 were defined as average years scores exceeding 0 5 were defined as wet years and scores below 0 5 were defined as dry years the z scores for the individual basins agree with the z scores calculated from the study area averaged winter precipitation totals fig 2 all dry and wet years are consistently dry or wet with a few average values across all of the sites 3 3 basin characteristics basin characteristics used in this analysis describe the size shape slope and relief of the study watersheds and were chosen to represent the variables that were most likely to influence baseflow stormflow and or peak flow table 1 all of the basin characteristics were calculated using arcgis 10 4 the spatial analyst toolbox and the national elevation dataset s 10 m digital elevation model stream networks were generated in arcgis using the hydrology tools in the spatial analyst toolbox with a flow accumulation threshold of 4 ha benstead and leigh 2012 analysis of the initial regression results indicated that only ten of the basin characteristics explain a significant amount of the variance in the dependent hydrologic variables table 2 compares these ten geomorphic variables across the 15 watersheds due to county and state level differences in soil survey mapping resolution and soil definition criteria ssurgo soils database soil survey staff 2015 parent material was modeled and standardized following the method of mcdonald and leigh 2014 this method delineates probable areas of alluvial or colluvial deposition utilizing slope 0 30 which is representative of alluvial and colluvial deposits in the study area and the relative proximity of each pixel to ridgelines or streams residuum was assumed to cover the remainder of the study watersheds while there are bedrock outcrops in the study area the methods used to delineate the parent material classes could not reliably predict their occurrence though locally important the regional importance of bare rock was deemed minor to non existent because coverage was less than 1 of the study area with a maximum watershed coverage of 4 alluvium and colluvium were analyzed together to represent areas that are either perennially or ephemerally connected to the stream network residuum was included to represent the hilltops and hillslopes that are not traditionally thought of as being connected to the stream network though ephemeral flow paths likely exist 3 4 land use land cover land use land cover lulc data for the years 1986 1991 1996 2001 and 2006 were obtained from the coweeta cwt long term ecological research program hepinstall cymerman 2011 these 30 m resolution datasets classified landsat imagery according to the national land cover database nlcd twenty class system for this analysis these twenty classes were generalized into three classes 1 forest classes 41 43 2 grass classes 71 and 81 and 3 developed classes 21 24 land cover percentage estimates for the intervening years were determined by linear interpolation in order to determine the potential error that linear interpolation may introduce the known land cover percentages for 1991 1996 and 2001 were modeled by linearly interpolating between the known years that bracketed them the average difference between observed cwt dataset and modeled lulc was less than 1 5 with a maximum error of 6 7 forest in 1991 mcdonald 2017 though land cover change often is episodic and nonlinear this method was determined to be sufficiently robust for this analysis and the errors were below accepted nlcd standards wickman et al 2010 though row crop agriculture can have a significant influence on runoff knox 2001 it was not included in this analysis because it covers less than 1 of the study area hepinstall cymerman 2011 each year s road network was created in arcgis by converting the developed pixels classes 21 24 of each lulc raster to polygons to select intersecting roads from the tiger topologically integrated geographic encoding and reference 2010 streets dataset trainor et al 2012 each year s road network was added to the previous year s network to help control for possible land cover misclassification errors and because roads are not ephemeral features on the landscape the 2010 tiger streets dataset was used because there was not a road dataset available for each year that land cover was available and this dataset was the first to update and correct the road coverage with ground verified gps corrected observations streets in this dataset are classified based on route type rttyp which include u s highways type u state roads type s and smaller roads types c county m municipal and o other aerial photos were used to estimate the widths of each rttyp these widths u 30 m s 15 m and all other classes 10 m were used to buffer the lines and provide an estimate of each watershed covered by roads all of the land cover types were then converted to polygons and each year s roads were merged with the land cover dataset so that watershed scale percentages of land cover as well as alluvial colluvial ac and residuum r coverages could be subset in arcgis and included in the analysis as independent variables table 1 3 5 hydrology dependent variables five stormflow variables describing the flashiness total and relative to base flow and total amount of stormflow were calculated using the daily average and 15 minute instantaneous discharge records from the usgs the variables used in this analysis were the ratio between seasonal maximum daily average discharge and the 15 minute maximum discharge peakdaily the richards baker flashiness index rbi baker et al 2004 the stormflow index sfi the average peak flow to baseflow ratio pbavg and the seasonal maximum peak flow to baseflow ratio pbmax table 1 the ratio between seasonal maximum daily average discharge and the 15 minute maximum discharge for that same day peakdaily was calculated as a measure of peak flashiness and to test the possibility that the order of magnitude difference between the study watersheds 70 750 km2 would influence the rest of the analyses a high peakdaily indicates that the daily average peak is comparable to the 15 minute peak less flashy total seasonal flashiness was calculated using the richards baker flashiness index rbi rbi is a measure of the daily change or flashiness of flow and is calculated by dividing the sum of the absolute value of daily change in discharge by the total amount of discharge during that period baker et al 2004 a high rbi indicates that the hydrography is very flashy with high peaks and steep rising and falling limbs daily average discharge records were separated into baseflow and stormflow components using the method of lyne and hollick 1979 this method uses a recursive digital filter to separate the flow record into quick stormflow and slow baseflow response components a forward pass filter is used to separate the quick and slow flow components and a backward pass filter is used to nullify any phase distortion introduced by the forward filter a filter parameter of 0 805 was used because it provided the best visual fit stormflow was calculated by subtracting baseflow from daily average discharge the stormflow index sfi was calculated by dividing the total amount of winter stormflow by total winter discharge the inverse of the more commonly used baseflow index the average peak flow to baseflow ratio pbavg was calculated by taking the seasonal average of the ratio between peak flow and baseflow the maximum peak flow to baseflow ratio pbmax is the ratio of seasonal maximum peak flow to baseflow on the day of seasonal maximum peak flow pbavg and pbmax were analyzed to take into account antecedent moisture conditions baseflow and provide dimensionless descriptors of peak flow due to the relatively coarse temporal resolution of the prism dataset monthly totals all daily peaks in discharge were included in the analyses regardless of magnitude 3 6 statistics multiple regression was used to determine the amount of variance in the hydrologic variables that could be explained by the climatic variables and the geomorphic and land cover characteristics of the 15 gaged watersheds while the gages were chosen due to their consistency and length of record five of the gages had one or more month missing during the period of study and a total of 18 observations watershed winters had to be removed from the initial dataset of 315 watershed winters 15 watersheds times 21 years in order to determine all of the characteristics that may be influencing regional stormflow instead of using forward or backward stepwise regression all possible models containing uncorrelated variables r 0 65 were created and the top three models for each time period for each hydrologic variable are presented below to understand how periods of wetness dryness influence the drivers of stormflow separate models were created for all n 297 average n 99 dry n 114 and wet years n 84 models were constrained to three variables because though there were a large number of observations n of 84 297 only 15 unique watersheds were analyzed the best models were chosen based on the r2 p value f ratio and aicc characteristics of the model compared to similar models prior to creating the regression models the dependent variables were log10 transformed to create normal distributions more suited for parametric statistics 4 results 4 1 continental scale teleconnections and precipitation all three teleconnections are weakly to moderately correlated to precipitation in the study area table 3 positive nao is weakly related to more precipitation and more peaks this positive correlation between nao and precipitation agrees with hartley 1999 and greenland 2001 negative pna is correlated to higher precipitation and more peaks compared to positive pna table 3 alternatively during positive pna the largest storm will be a larger percent of total precipitation than during negative pna these results are similar to the findings of henderson and robinson 1994 that found positive pna often had fewer precipitation events but much larger events when they did occur interestingly enso has the most consistent and strongest relationship to total precipitation and percent max storm is of the total table 3 these results agree with previous research by ropelewski and halpert 1986 that found el nino warm enso events to be related to more rainfall in the southern united states the correlation analysis indicates continental scale teleconnections can provide an understanding of the character of seasonal rainfall peak characteristics that monthly and seasonal prism data cannot provide 4 2 daily average peak to 15 minute peak peakdaily for the time period analyzed peakdaily ranged from 0 21 to 0 99 with a mean of 0 59 fig 3 the smaller watersheds tended to be flashier than the larger watersheds as expected and there was very little difference between average dry and wet years the top three peakdaily models for each time period are presented in table 4 for all four time periods geomorphic differences between the study watersheds entire stream gradient and relative relief explain the majority of the explained variance in peakdaily a land cover variable explains a significant amount of the explained variance in average and dry years winter and january pna along with february and march nao explain a significant amount of the explained variance during all time periods a prism variable only explains a significant amount of the variance in one model table 4 4 3 richards baker flashiness index rbi the rbi values ranged from 0 11 to 0 47 with a mean of 0 24 fig 3 the larger study watersheds tended to be less flashy than the smaller watersheds and dry years less flashy than wet years the top three rbi models for each time period are presented in table 5 for all four time periods geomorphic differences between the study watersheds standard deviation of the topographic index with the standard deviation of slope and relative relief explain the majority of the explained variance in rbi a land cover variable roads on alluvium colluvium was found to explain a significant amount of the explained variance during average dry and wet years total winter precipitation explains a significant amount of the explained variance in all of the all years models during average years prism variables precipitation prior peak and precipitation peak also explain a significant amount of the explained variance in rbi alternatively during dry and wet years nao and or pna explain a significant amount of the explained variance in rbi 4 4 stormflow index sfi sfi ranged from 0 10 to 0 39 with an average of 0 23 fig 3 smaller watersheds tended to have higher sfi than larger watersheds and wet years produced more stormflow than dry years the top three sfi models for each time period are presented in table 6 the majority of the explained variance in all but one of the sfi models is explained by average watershed slope development on residuum explains a significant amount of the explained variance during all average and wet years during dry years grass on alluvium colluvium explains a significant amount of the explained variance in sfi similar to rbi total winter precipitation explains a significant amount of the explained variance in all of the all years sfi models for all of the other time periods nao and or pna explain a significant amount of the explained variance in sfi 4 5 average peak to base ratio pbavg for the time period analyzed pbavg ranged from 0 35 to 2 30 and tended to be higher in smaller watersheds fig 3 the top three pbavg models for each time period are presented in table 7 unlike the models for the previous hydrologic variables a climate variable total winter precipitation or february nao explains the majority of the explained variance in pbavg during all and dry years during average and wet years relative relief and stand deviation of the topographic index with standard deviation of slope explain the majority of the explained variance in pbavg roads on alluvium colluvium was found to explain a significant amount of the variance during all years average years and wet years december pna was found to be an important part of the average and wet years pbavg models and february nao explains a significant amount of the explained variance in all three of the dry years models a prism variable total winter precipitation was only found to explain a significant amount of the explained variance in the all years models 4 6 maximum peak to base ratio pbmax for the years analyzed pbmax ranged from 1 51 to 14 71 and tended to be greater in smaller watersheds fig 3 similar to pbavg wet years tended to have flashier peaks than dry the top three models for each time period are presented in table 8 a geomorphic variable explains the majority of the explained variance in two of the all years models and all of the average years models during dry years winter pna and february nao explain more of the explained variance than any of the three geomorphic variables that were found to explain a significant amount of the explained variance in pbmax during wet years january pna explains the majority of the explained variance roads on alluvium colluvium was found to be significant during all years but only explained a small portion of the explained variance similar to the other dependent variables total winter precipitation explains a significant amount of the explained variance in all years pbmax during average years precipitation variables were also found to explain a significant amount of the explained variance in pbmax 4 7 stormflow drivers the geomorphic variables that appeared most frequently in the models were average slope and the standard deviation of slope appearing in 10 of all of the models the relative importance of average slope was greatest during dry years 16 while the importance of the standard deviation of slope was greatest during average years while not explaining a large portion of any of the hydrologic variables by itself when coupled with the standard deviation of the topographic index melton relief or average slope the standard deviation of slope helped explain a significant amount of the explained variance in all of the dependent variables except for sfi similarly drainage shape was found to be important when coupled with melton relief or the entire stream gradient see fig 4 a land cover variable was an important descriptor of variance in all but four of the climatic periods wet years peakdaily all years rbi and average dry and wet years pbmax the relative importance of the land cover variables are consistent regardless of the climatic period explaining on average between 6 and 9 of the variance in the dependent variables the most frequent land cover variable was roads on alluvium colluvium which appeared in 4 of all of the models as well as in 4 of the models in each climate period both development on residuum and grass on alluvium colluvium appeared in 2 of the models though land cover was found to explain a statistically significant amount of the explained variance none of the land cover variables were watershed scale measures of land cover the prism variable that was in the most models was total seasonal precipitation appearing in 27 of the all years models though total seasonal precipitation explained a significant amount of the variance in almost all of the all years models total seasonal precipitation was not found to explain a significant amount of the variance in any of the other climatic periods the other two prism variables that were found to be important were precipitation during the month of peak discharge and precipitation during the month prior to and during the month of peak discharge these variables were most important during average years appearing in at least one model for each one of the hydrologic variables the continental scale teleconnection that appeared in the most models was february nao which appeared in 8 of the models and 27 of the dry years models the next most important teleconnections were december and january pna these variables appeared in 5 and 4 of the models and 18 and 11 of the wet years models respectively overall pna appeared in slightly more models than nao 16 versus 13 in the majority of the models both nao and pna are positively correlated with the dependent variable indicating stormflow and flashiness will be greatest when the positive phases of the two patterns coincide 5 discussion 5 1 watershed geomorphology it was initially hypothesized that the geomorphic characteristics of the study watersheds i e slope would explain the majority of the variance in stormflow the results indicate that the geomorphic differences between the study watersheds explain the majority of the inter basin spatial variance in regional stormflow these results are similar to a study by julian and gardner 2014 that found watershed characteristics become more important than precipitation regime when comparing larger 3rd order watersheds additionally the results of this study indicate that the importance of each geomorphic variable are dependent variable and climatic period specific the standard deviation of the topographic index and melton relief explain the majority of the explained variance in rbi and average slope explains the majority of the explained variance in sfi and pbmax all three of these geomorphic variables explain a significant portion of the explained variance in pbavg but their importance changes depending on whether the season is dry or wet table 7 these findings are similar to those of sidle et al 1995 who found antecedent moisture conditions to influence the stormflow response of forested watersheds near hitachi ohta japan during dry conditions sidle et al 1995 found that areas connected to the stream network were contributing the majority of stormflow to the streams while during wet years hillslopes became the main contributor the shifting importance of melton relief and average slope indicates that there also may be a wetness threshold in the sbrm where watershed characteristics that influence the flashiness of stormflow melton relief are influencing peak flows during average and wet years and watershed characteristics that favor runoff average slope are influencing peak flow during dry years another interpretation is that the wetness threshold may not be related to where the runoff is coming from but the relationship between runoff and baseflow zecharias and brutsaert 1988 zecharias and brutsaert 1988 found average watershed slope to be positively correlated with and a significant predictor of groundwater outflow during dry years the importance of average slope may indicate that there is likely a reduction in baseflow that would cause a relative increase in the average peak flow to baseflow ratio peakdaily is influenced by the entire stream gradient drainage shape and the standard deviation of the topographic index the influence drainage shape has on peakdaily is not surprising and agrees with earlier literature studying flood wave propagation gregory and walling 1973 the importance of the entire stream gradient and the standard deviation of the topographic index is more complex and is likely related to their relationships to drainage density mcdonald 2017 regionally drainage density is negatively correlated with entire stream gradient and positively correlated with the standard deviation of the topographic index the importance of the entire stream gradient and the standard deviation of the topographic index and their correlations with drainage density suggest that peak discharge will be flashier in watersheds where drainage density is low these findings are contrary to previous research that has found a positive relationship between drainage density and peak flow carlston 1963 gregory and walling 1968 the negative relationship between drainage density and relative relief is not novel to the sbrm and a similar relationship has been found in the mountains of japan oguchi 1997 and through experimental methods by tucker and bras 1998 oguchi 1997 concluded that the negative correlation between drainage density and relative relief was due to the influence shallow landslides have on headwater areas of watersheds though studies of debris flows in the sbrm have found a relatively short recurrence interval for debris flows if the whole region is taken into account wieczorek et al 2000 eaton et al 2003 the negative relationship between drainage density and relief is likely due to the saturation threshold theory for channel initiation posited by tucker and bras 1998 the steep hillslopes and relatively flat valley bottoms that characterize the southern blue ridge mountains will quickly transfer subsurface flow through the relatively thick saprolite found on the hillslopes to the relatively flat valley bottoms the saturation threshold for channel initiation will not be exceeded until the subsurface flow reaches the relatively flat valley bottoms thus imposing a limit on drainage density as hypothesized by montgomery and dietrich 1989 the results of this analysis indicate that in humid mountainous regions i e japan and the sbrm high drainage density may not always be positively correlated with high flood peaks due to a reduction in drainage density in smaller flashier watersheds due to either mass wasting near headwater streams japan or due to a saturation threshold for stream channel initiation in the southern blue ridge mountains total seasonal flashiness rbi is influenced by the standard deviation of the topographic index melton relief and the standard deviation of slope the influence of these variables is interpreted as melton relief contributing to the flashiness of the large events due to its influence on peak flashiness and the standard deviation of the topographic index and the standard deviation of slope describing the connectedness of hillslope runoff to the stream network while flashiness tends to decrease with increasing drainage area baker et al 2004 the importance of the melton relief suggests that at least in mountainous areas relative relief is a more important driver of flashiness than just the amount of land draining to the outlet these results are significant because the studies that utilize rbi often do not include geomorphic variables besides drainage area in their models e g poff et al 2006 dow 2007 and attribute differences in rbi solely to the impact of land cover while land cover is likely influencing the flashiness of the streams in these studies the geomorphology of those basins could also be having a significant influence that is completely overlooked the importance of average slope appearing in 10 of the models is not surprising and is likely related to the infiltration and storage potential of the landscape similar to the findings of hewlitt and hibbert 1967 a study of the relationship between soil and geomorphology in the eastern sbrm found a strong negative correlation between soil thickness and slope graham et al 1990 these conditions would favor runoff over infiltration in steep watersheds which agrees with the results of this analysis additionally during dry years when infiltration rates and capacity are likely more important average slope explains a significant amount of the explained variance in pbavg these findings indicate that the characteristics of peak runoff may be related to an infiltration threshold above which the connectedness of the landscape becomes more important than infiltration rates and capacity 5 2 land use land cover it was initially hypothesized that development and grasslands in the alluvial bottomlands would have the most influence on stormflow during dry years the results indicate that roads and grasslands in the alluvial bottomlands do influence stormflow in the region during all time periods and not just during dry years interestingly anthropic development on residuum was also found to be an important driver of sfi during all of the climate periods except for dry years the importance of development on residuum is interpreted as a measure of the connectedness of the landscape during average years jones et al 2000 these results show the importance of understanding the whole watershed and determining whether all of the areas that produce runoff are connected to the stream network the importance of roads on alluvium colluvium in the peakdaily rbi and pbavg models indicate that the relatively small area that is covered by roads in the alluvial and colluvial bottomlands is influencing the flashiness of discharge in the region agreeing with the effective impervious area of booth et al 2002 however the importance of development on residuum paints a more complex picture of storm runoff and highlights the importance of the increased connectedness of the landscape caused by development in this case exurbanization outside of the stream network the influence of the other important land cover variable grass on alluvium colluvium on peakdaily and sfi could be due to the lower infiltration rates in pastures found by johnson 1952 and price et al 2011 though it also could be related to the regional prevalence of drainage ditches in the alluvial and colluvial bottomlands glenn 1911 glenn s 1911 usgs monograph suggested that drainage ditches be dug across the bottomlands to quickly route storm water away from the arable land and reduce the impact precipitation events had on the region these drainage ditches are still in use today and similar to the findings of buchanan et al 2013 will expedite stormflow from the surrounding landscape to the rivers and streams increasing the importance of stormflow over baseflow 5 3 climate while the geomorphology and land cover of the study area explain the variance between the watersheds continental scale teleconnections were found to explain the majority of the inter annual variation in the dependent variables the results of this study agree with previous research that found a significant positive correlation between nao and precipitation in the southeastern united states hurrell and van loon 1997 hartley 1999 these results are not surprising as the enhanced pressure gradient between the icelandic low and the azores high that characterizes positive nao creates conditions that favor zonal flow across the southeastern united states and increases the availability of warm moist air from the gulf interestingly with the exception of one model dry years pbavg pna was also found to be positively correlated with stormflow in the region while these results may seem to be contrary to previous research that suggests that the meridional flow that characterizes positive pna should increase the frequency of blocking events and reduce precipitation in the region leathers et al 1991 henderson and robinson 1994 it is this increased frequency of blocking events that is interpreted as increasing stormflow in the region henderson and robinson 1994 found a significant reduction in the number of events during positive phases of pna meridional flow but the storms that did occur were often larger than the more frequent storms that occurred during negative phases of pna zonal flow these storm event characteristics would explain the increased flashiness caused by positive phases of pna in the sbrm additionally with a reduction in the number of storms baseflow will potentially be reduced which will further increase the ratio of stormflow to baseflow when potentially larger storms are affecting the region 6 conclusion the stormflow characteristics flashiness and magnitude of fifteen usgs gaged watersheds in the sbrm were analyzed to determine the drivers of regional stormflow forty five variables describing the geomorphic climatic and land cover characteristics of these gaged basins were used to create multiple regression models describing the amount of variance that could be explained in five stormflow variables peak flashiness peakdaily total flashiness rbi relative amount of stormflow sfi average peak flashiness pbavg and maximum peak flashiness pbmax out of the thousands of potential three variable models sixty best models were chosen to determine the geomorphic climatic and land cover variables that best describe the variance in regional stormflow during all average dry and wet years results indicate that watershed geomorphology by itself explains 40 50 of the inter basin variance in the dependent stormflow variables melton relief basin relief divided by the square root of drainage area and the standard deviation of the topographic index were found to be the main geomorphic drivers of rbi and average slope was found to be the main geomorphic driver of sfi and pbavg though drainage area explains a statistically significant amount of the variation in regional stormflow the importance of melton relief the standard deviation of the topographic index and slope both watershed average and standard deviation indicates that the processes controlling stormflow creation and propagation are much more complex than just the size of the watershed additionally this study found that the climate and basin characteristics that explain variance in the hydrologic variables during periods of wetness and drought are significantly different by segregating average dry and wet years the influence of low infiltration rate capacity land cover types could be seen in the average and dry years models when the high infiltration rate capacity areas that cover the majority of the landscape forested lands are not as actively contributing to runoff the only land cover variables roads development and grassland that were found to be important were those that cover spatially discrete on alluvium colluvium or residuum areas of the study area these findings indicate that variance in regional stormflow can not only be explained by land cover near the stream network on alluvium colluvium but also by land cover far from the stream network on saprolite residuum while the geomorphology of the study area explained much of the variance between the watersheds continental scale teleconnections were found to explain the majority of the inter annual variation in the dependent variables the results of this study agree with previous research that found a significant positive correlation between nao and precipitation in the southeastern united states hurrell and van loon 1997 hartley 1999 an interesting finding is that in the majority of the models pna was also found to be positively correlated with stormflow in the region though these results may seem to be contrary to previous research that suggests that the meridional flow that characterizes positive pna should increase the frequency of blocking events and reduce total precipitation in the region it is this increased frequency of blocking events that is interpreted as increasing stormflow in the region with a reduction in the number of storms due to an increased number of blocking events baseflow will potentially be reduced which will increase the relative importance of stormflow when the potentially larger storms associated with positive pna do occur the results of this study highlight the complexity of southern blue ridge mountain stormflow hydrology

keywords storm hydrology geomorphology continental scale teleconnections soil parent material 1 introduction stormflow or quickflow is the non baseflow component of a hydrograph following a precipitation event hewlett and hibbert 1967 while precipitation and antecedent moisture conditions intensity duration and spatial distribution are the main drivers of stormflow bracken and croke 2007 the relative amount of stormflow and the flashiness of the discharge produced by a watershed is a function of watershed morphology and land cover generally runoff will be greater in watersheds that have steep slopes and high relative relief sidle et al 2000 rose and peters 2001 montgomery and dietrich 2002 jackson et al 2014 when antecedent moisture conditions are high the importance of slope to runoff creation often increases because infiltrated subsurface flow is forced to flow parallel to the ground surface by a saturated zone or a relatively impermeable layer montgomery and dietrich 2002 jackson et al 2014 disturbance of the natural landscape can also increase the relative amount of stormflow and the flashiness of the discharge produced by a watershed knox 1977 hollis 1979 disturbed

the disturbance but also its pattern jones et al 2000 carle et al 2005 alberti et al 2007 buchanan et al 2013 these studies have shown that relatively small portions of a watershed e g roads and agricultural drainage ditches can have an inordinately large impact on storm discharge by increasing the hydrologic connectivity of the landscape and bypassing groundwater flow this study focuses on water years 1986 through 2006 due to the length and completeness of the usgs gage records in the southern blue ridge mountains fig 1 this research determined how low amounts of development 15 and pastoral activities 20 influence the amount and character of stormflow relative to baseflow and total discharge and the flashiness of flow in the southern blue ridge mountains sbrm we hypothesized that watershed morphometry would explain the majority of the variance in the amount and character of stormflow between the study watersheds smaller steeper watersheds were expected to have greater amounts of stormflow and much flashier flow compared to larger watersheds with lower slopes additionally we hypothesized that especially during dry years watersheds with greater amounts of pasture and low to moderate amounts of development in the alluvial bottomlands will have flashier flows and produce more stormflow because the landscape favors runoff over infiltration research in the upper little tennessee river valley of western north carolina suggests that at least under drought conditions baseflow was significantly lower in pastured versus forested watersheds price et al 2011 these differences in baseflow were attributed to the lower infiltration rates of compacted pasture soils versus lower bulk density forest soils price et al 2010 however examining hydrograph characteristics across this same region jackson et al 2017 found that evidence of land use s influence on suspended sediment concentrations was overshadowed by regional differences in precipitation across watersheds to account for precipitation differences across the region the study was constrained to the winter season december through march when frontal systems bring more uniform distributions of precipitation gamble and meentemeyer 1997 climatically similar periods average dry wet years were subset and analyzed separately so that the large differences in precipitation between wet and dry years would not overshadow the potential influence of land use land cover soil parent material specific percentages of land cover were compared to general watershed scale percentages to determine if land cover near the stream network alluvium colluvium or on hillslopes saprolite residuum explain more variance than the general watershed scale percentages road coverages were also added to the land cover dataset to provide a metric that represents the road network enhanced hilltop and hillslope connectivity to the stream network analyzing land cover percentages on spatially discrete portions of the landscape on alluvium colluvium or saprolite residuum during climatically similar years allowed for a better understanding of how stormflow and flashiness may be affected by various scenarios of development and or climate change to determine if continental scale processes have an imprint on regional stormflow characteristics the relative influence of indices describing the monthly modes of continental scale teleconnections e g pacific north american north atlantic oscillation and el nino southern oscillation is compared to the relative influence of monthly and seasonal estimates of precipitation prism 2014 previous research has shown that continental scale teleconnections e g pacific north american pattern north atlantic oscillation and el nino southern oscillation are the main drivers of inter annual variability in temperature and precipitation in the eastern united states ropelewski and halpert 1986 hartley 1999 henderson and robinson 1994 in light of these findings we hypothesized that the majority of the inter annual variation in stormflow will be explained by fluctuations in continental scale teleconnections this research determined 1 the amount of variance that is explained by climate basin morphology and land use land cover 2 whether soil parent material specific percentages of land cover explain more variance than generalized watershed scale percentages and 3 the role of continental scale teleconnections and land cover during periods of wetness dryness this work was motivated by the need to better understand the drivers of hydrologic variation in meso scale montane watersheds 2 study area the geology of the sbrm consists of a northeast trending middle proterozoic granitic gneiss core that is unconformably overlain on each flank by younger proterozoic and early paleozoic quartz diorite and biotite gneiss with scattered pockets of amphibolite robinson et al 1992 overlying the bedrock is a thick mantle up to 30 m of highly weathered residuum southworth et al 2003 this residuum contributes significant quantities of fine sediment to the valley bottoms through colluvial and fluvial transport processes price and leigh 2006 the geomorphology of the region is dominated by colluvial processes in the headwaters phillips 2002 and alluvial colluvial fans mixing with the dominantly fluvial higher order alluvial bottomlands leigh 2010 mcdonald and leigh 2014 although elevations are typically higher in the northern and northeastern portion of the sbrm mean annual rainfall generally decreases from the southwest to the northeast due to orographic lifting and rain out effects as storm systems move from the ridge and valley and piedmont into the highlands of the sbrm fig 1 regionally interactions between oceanic and continental air masses bring frontal systems during winter and tropical disturbances during late summer and early fall lecce 2000 the frequency and character of winter precipitation events in the southeastern us has been shown to correlate with continental scale teleconnections including the pacific north american pattern pna leathers et al 1991 henderson and robinson 1994 the north atlantic oscillation nao hurrell and van loon 1997 greenland 2001 and the el nino southern oscillation enso ropelewski and halpert 1986 eichler and higgins 2006 non indigenous settlement of the southern blue ridge mountains began with small

develop as streams laterally erode into the historical stratum leigh 2010 rogers and leigh 2013 regional settlement patterns concentrated almost exclusively on the terraces and bottomlands of the alluvial valleys until the 1960s beginning in the 1970s the number of steep slope exurban developments began steadily increasing gragson and bolstad 2006 population forecasts suggest that many exurban developments will grow to suburban or urban densities within the next twenty years and up to 67 of new buildings will be built within forested areas kirk et al 2012 while the influences that traditional land use and exurbanization have on water quality and baseflow have been studied sutherland et al 2002 price et al 2011 webster et al 2012 their influence on stormflow has not yet been examined 3 data and methods 3 1 selection of usgs gages out of the approximately 250 usgs gaged watersheds in the sbrm 15 watersheds were selected fig 1 that met the following criteria 1 drainage areas between 30 and 800 km2 to target non headwater wadeable streams 2 lacked large impoundments that would attenuate flood peaks and 3 had near continuous at least 15 complete winter seasons daily discharge data from 1986 2006 table 1 is a list of the independent climatic geomorphic and land cover variables and dependent hydrologic variables used in this analysis data sources and the methods used to process the data are described in detail below 3 2 climate analysis intentionally focused on the winter months december through march because of the relatively uniform spatial distribution of precipitation that frontal systems have on the sbrm during this season due to the regional focus of this study and because each watershed did not have a climate station monthly prism parameter elevation relationships on independent slopes model data from the oregon climate group were used to obtain monthly and seasonal estimates of precipitation for each watershed prism 2014 these monthly estimates of precipitation were determined using a watershed area weighted average from the 4 km prism dataset table 1 indices of the north atlantic oscillation nao pacific north american pattern pna and el nino southern oscillation enso were downloaded from the national weather service s climate prediction center http www cpc ncep noaa gov these three indices were chosen because previous research found a strong relationship between these three indices and inter annual variations in temperature and precipitation in the eastern united states henderson and robinson 1994 found that during a positive pna upper level meridional flows tended to reduce the number of precipitation events but was also often related to relatively large events when they did happen their study also found that during a negative pna upper level zonal flows tended to bring more precipitation events but these events are often more clustered and smaller conversely nao has been found to be positively correlated with temperature and precipitation in the southeastern us hartley 1999 this positive correlation is caused by an increased zonal pressure gradient across the northern atlantic creating conditions where warmer wetter air advects into the eastern us hurrell and dickson 2004 ropelewski and halpert 1986 found that in the southeastern united states the majority of el nino la nina events were associated with lower higher temperatures and higher lower amounts of precipitation these temperature and precipitation differences are likely caused by a displacement of storm tracks eastward or westward during el nino or la nina events respectively eichler and higgins 2006 the teleconnection indices were classified by water year oct 1 sept 30 and winter season means were calculated and included as additional independent variables in order to determine how nao pna and enso affects the inter monthly character of precipitation in the region daily precipitation records were obtained from the available long term climate stations in the region that had mostly complete records from 1986 to 2006 fig 1 for each climate station total seasonal precipitation and number of peaks were calculated using base r r core team 2017 peaks were defined as any peak in daily precipitation that was larger than the day before as well as the day after storms were separated using the datacombine package in r gandrund 2016 the datacombine package separates periods of precipitation from quiescent periods storms were defined as any period of precipitation the contribution of the largest storm to total precipitation was analyzed by dividing the largest storm of the winter season by total seasonal precipitation during that season max storm of total periods of wetness dryness were subdivided based on z scores of regional average total winter precipitation z scores were used to determine climatic periods rather than one of the palmer drought indices because z scores provide a short term indicator of wetness or dryness tailored to the data using the prism dataset total seasonal precipitation was calculated for each winter season 1986 2006 for each watershed a regional average of total winter precipitation for the 15 watersheds was used to calculate the z scores years with a z score between 0 5 and 0 5 were defined as average years scores exceeding 0 5 were defined as wet years and scores below 0 5 were defined as dry years the z scores for the individual basins agree with the z scores calculated from the study area averaged winter precipitation totals fig 2 all dry and wet years are consistently dry or wet with a few average values across all of the sites 3 3 basin characteristics basin characteristics used in this analysis describe the size shape slope and relief of the study watersheds and were chosen to represent the variables that were most likely to influence baseflow stormflow and or peak flow table 1 all of the basin characteristics were calculated using arcgis 10 4 the spatial analyst toolbox and the national elevation dataset s 10 m digital elevation model stream networks were generated in arcgis using the hydrology tools in the spatial analyst toolbox with a flow accumulation threshold of 4 ha benstead and leigh 2012 analysis of the initial regression results indicated that only ten of the basin characteristics explain a significant amount of the variance in the dependent hydrologic variables table 2 compares these ten geomorphic variables across the 15 watersheds due to county and state level differences in soil survey mapping resolution and soil definition criteria ssurgo soils database soil survey staff 2015 parent material was modeled and standardized following the method of mcdonald and leigh 2014 this method delineates probable areas of alluvial or colluvial deposition utilizing slope 0 30 which is representative of alluvial and colluvial deposits in the study area and the relative proximity of each pixel to ridgelines or streams residuum was assumed to cover the remainder of the study watersheds while there are bedrock outcrops in the study area the methods used to delineate the parent material classes could not reliably predict their occurrence though locally important the regional importance of bare rock was deemed minor to non existent because coverage was less than 1 of the study area with a maximum watershed coverage of 4 alluvium and colluvium were analyzed together to represent areas that are either perennially or ephemerally connected to the stream network residuum was included to represent the hilltops and hillslopes that are not traditionally thought of as being connected to the stream network though ephemeral flow paths likely exist 3 4 land use land cover land use land cover lulc data for the years 1986 1991 1996 2001 and 2006 were obtained from the coweeta cwt long term ecological research program hepinstall cymerman 2011 these 30 m resolution datasets classified landsat imagery according to the national land cover database nlcd twenty class system for this analysis these twenty classes were generalized into three classes 1 forest classes 41 43 2 grass classes 71 and 81 and 3 developed classes 21 24 land cover percentage estimates for the intervening years were determined by linear interpolation in order to determine the potential error that linear interpolation may introduce the known land cover percentages for 1991 1996 and 2001 were modeled by linearly interpolating between the known years that bracketed them the average difference between observed cwt dataset and modeled lulc was less than 1 5 with a maximum error of 6 7 forest in 1991 mcdonald 2017 though land cover change often is episodic and nonlinear this method was determined to be sufficiently robust for this analysis and the errors were below accepted nlcd standards wickman et al 2010 though row crop agriculture can have a significant influence on runoff knox 2001 it was not included in this analysis because it covers less than 1 of the study area hepinstall cymerman 2011 each year s road network was created in arcgis by converting the developed pixels classes 21 24 of each lulc raster to polygons to select intersecting roads from the tiger topologically integrated geographic encoding and reference 2010 streets dataset trainor et al 2012 each year s road network was added to the previous year s network to help control for possible land cover misclassification errors and because roads are not ephemeral features on the landscape the 2010 tiger streets dataset was used because there was not a road dataset available for each year that land cover was available and this dataset was the first to update and correct the road coverage with ground verified gps corrected observations streets in this dataset are classified based on route type rttyp which include u s highways type u state roads type s and smaller roads types c county m municipal and o other aerial photos were used to estimate the widths of each rttyp these widths u 30 m s 15 m and all other classes 10 m were used to buffer the lines and provide an estimate of each watershed covered by roads all of the land cover types were then converted to polygons and each year s roads were merged with the land cover dataset so that watershed scale percentages of land cover as well as alluvial colluvial ac and residuum r coverages could be subset in arcgis and included in the analysis as independent variables table 1 3 5 hydrology dependent variables five stormflow variables describing the flashiness total and relative to base flow and total amount of stormflow were calculated using the daily average and 15 minute instantaneous discharge records from the usgs the variables used in this analysis were the ratio between seasonal maximum daily average discharge and the 15 minute maximum discharge peakdaily the richards baker flashiness index rbi baker et al 2004 the stormflow index sfi the average peak flow to baseflow ratio pbavg and the seasonal maximum peak flow to baseflow ratio pbmax table 1 the ratio between seasonal maximum daily average discharge and the 15 minute maximum discharge for that same day peakdaily was calculated as a measure of peak flashiness and to test the possibility that the order of magnitude difference between the study watersheds 70 750 km2 would influence the rest of the analyses a high peakdaily indicates that the daily average peak is comparable to the 15 minute peak less flashy total seasonal flashiness was calculated using the richards baker flashiness index rbi rbi is a measure of the daily change or flashiness of flow and is calculated by dividing the sum of the absolute value of daily change in discharge by the total amount of discharge during that period baker et al 2004 a high rbi indicates that the hydrography is very flashy with high peaks and steep rising and falling limbs daily average discharge records were separated into baseflow and stormflow components using the method of lyne and hollick 1979 this method uses a recursive digital filter to separate the flow record into quick stormflow and slow baseflow response components a forward pass filter is used to separate the quick and slow flow components and a backward pass filter is used to nullify any phase distortion introduced by the forward filter a filter parameter of 0 805 was used because it provided the best visual fit stormflow was calculated by subtracting baseflow from daily average discharge the stormflow index sfi was calculated by dividing the total amount of winter stormflow by total winter discharge the inverse of the more commonly used baseflow index the average peak flow to baseflow ratio pbavg was calculated by taking the seasonal average of the ratio between peak flow and baseflow the maximum peak flow to baseflow ratio pbmax is the ratio of seasonal maximum peak flow to baseflow on the day of seasonal maximum peak flow pbavg and pbmax were analyzed to take into account antecedent moisture conditions baseflow and provide dimensionless descriptors of peak flow due to the relatively coarse temporal resolution of the prism dataset monthly totals all daily peaks in discharge were included in the analyses regardless of magnitude 3 6 statistics multiple regression was used to determine the amount of variance in the hydrologic variables that could be explained by the climatic variables and the geomorphic and land cover characteristics of the 15 gaged watersheds while the gages were chosen due to their consistency and length of record five of the gages had one or more month missing during the period of study and a total of 18 observations watershed winters had to be removed from the initial dataset of 315 watershed winters 15 watersheds times 21 years in order to determine all of the characteristics that may be influencing regional stormflow instead of using forward or backward stepwise regression all possible models containing uncorrelated variables r 0 65 were created and the top three models for each time period for each hydrologic variable are presented below to understand how periods of wetness dryness influence the drivers of stormflow separate models were created for all n 297 average n 99 dry n 114 and wet years n 84 models were constrained to three variables because though there were a large number of observations n of 84 297 only 15 unique watersheds were analyzed the best models were chosen based on the r2 p value f ratio and aicc characteristics of the model compared to similar models prior to creating the regression models the dependent variables were log10 transformed to create normal distributions more suited for parametric statistics 4 results 4 1 continental scale teleconnections and precipitation all three teleconnections are weakly to moderately correlated to precipitation in the study area table 3 positive nao is weakly related to more precipitation and more peaks this positive correlation between nao and precipitation agrees with hartley 1999 and greenland 2001 negative pna is correlated to higher precipitation and more peaks compared to positive pna table 3 alternatively during positive pna the largest storm will be a larger percent of total precipitation than during negative pna these results are similar to the findings of henderson and robinson 1994 that found positive pna often had fewer precipitation events but much larger events when they did occur interestingly enso has the most consistent and strongest relationship to total precipitation and percent max storm is of the total table 3 these results agree with previous research by ropelewski and halpert 1986 that found el nino warm enso events to be related to more rainfall in the southern united states the correlation analysis indicates continental scale teleconnections can provide an understanding of the character of seasonal rainfall peak characteristics that monthly and seasonal prism data cannot provide 4 2 daily average peak to 15 minute peak peakdaily for the time period analyzed peakdaily ranged from 0 21 to 0 99 with a mean of 0 59 fig 3 the smaller watersheds tended to be flashier than the larger watersheds as expected and there was very little difference between average dry and wet years the top three peakdaily models for each time period are presented in table 4 for all four time periods geomorphic differences between the study watersheds entire stream gradient and relative relief explain the majority of the explained variance in peakdaily a land cover variable explains a significant amount of the explained variance in average and dry years winter and january pna along with february and march nao explain a significant amount of the explained variance during all time periods a prism variable only explains a significant amount of the variance in one model table 4 4 3 richards baker flashiness index rbi the rbi values ranged from 0 11 to 0 47 with a mean of 0 24 fig 3 the larger study watersheds tended to be less flashy than the smaller watersheds and dry years less flashy than wet years the top three rbi models for each time period are presented in table 5 for all four time periods geomorphic differences between the study watersheds standard deviation of the topographic index with the standard deviation of slope and relative relief explain the majority of the explained variance in rbi a land cover variable roads on alluvium colluvium was found to explain a significant amount of the explained variance during average dry and wet years total winter precipitation explains a significant amount of the explained variance in all of the all years models during average years prism variables precipitation prior peak and precipitation peak also explain a significant amount of the explained variance in rbi alternatively during dry and wet years nao and or pna explain a significant amount of the explained variance in rbi 4 4 stormflow index sfi sfi ranged from 0 10 to 0 39 with an average of 0 23 fig 3 smaller watersheds tended to have higher sfi than larger watersheds and wet years produced more stormflow than dry years the top three sfi models for each time period are presented in table 6 the majority of the explained variance in all but one of the sfi models is explained by average watershed slope development on residuum explains a significant amount of the explained variance during all average and wet years during dry years grass on alluvium colluvium explains a significant amount of the explained variance in sfi similar to rbi total winter precipitation explains a significant amount of the explained variance in all of the all years sfi models for all of the other time periods nao and or pna explain a significant amount of the explained variance in sfi 4 5 average peak to base ratio pbavg for the time period analyzed pbavg ranged from 0 35 to 2 30 and tended to be higher in smaller watersheds fig 3 the top three pbavg models for each time period are presented in table 7 unlike the models for the previous hydrologic variables a climate variable total winter precipitation or february nao explains the majority of the explained variance in pbavg during all and dry years during average and wet years relative relief and stand deviation of the topographic index with standard deviation of slope explain the majority of the explained variance in pbavg roads on alluvium colluvium was found to explain a significant amount of the variance during all years average years and wet years december pna was found to be an important part of the average and wet years pbavg models and february nao explains a significant amount of the explained variance in all three of the dry years models a prism variable total winter precipitation was only found to explain a significant amount of the explained variance in the all years models 4 6 maximum peak to base ratio pbmax for the years analyzed pbmax ranged from 1 51 to 14 71 and tended to be greater in smaller watersheds fig 3 similar to pbavg wet years tended to have flashier peaks than dry the top three models for each time period are presented in table 8 a geomorphic variable explains the majority of the explained variance in two of the all years models and all of the average years models during dry years winter pna and february nao explain more of the explained variance than any of the three geomorphic variables that were found to explain a significant amount of the explained variance in pbmax during wet years january pna explains the majority of the explained variance roads on alluvium colluvium was found to be significant during all years but only explained a small portion of the explained variance similar to the other dependent variables total winter precipitation explains a significant amount of the explained variance in all years pbmax during average years precipitation variables were also found to explain a significant amount of the explained variance in pbmax 4 7 stormflow drivers the geomorphic variables that appeared most frequently in the models were average slope and the standard deviation of slope appearing in 10 of all of the models the relative importance of average slope was greatest during dry years 16 while the importance of the standard deviation of slope was greatest during average years while not explaining a large portion of any of the hydrologic variables by itself when coupled with the standard deviation of the topographic index melton relief or average slope the standard deviation of slope helped explain a significant amount of the explained variance in all of the dependent variables except for sfi similarly drainage shape was found to be important when coupled with melton relief or the entire stream gradient see fig 4 a land cover variable was an important descriptor of variance in all but four of the climatic periods wet years peakdaily all years rbi and average dry and wet years pbmax the relative importance of the land cover variables are consistent regardless of the climatic period explaining on average between 6 and 9 of the variance in the dependent variables the most frequent land cover variable was roads on alluvium colluvium which appeared in 4 of all of the models as well as in 4 of the models in each climate period both development on residuum and grass on alluvium colluvium appeared in 2 of the models though land cover was found to explain a statistically significant amount of the explained variance none of the land cover variables were watershed scale measures of land cover the prism variable that was in the most models was total seasonal precipitation appearing in 27 of the all years models though total seasonal precipitation explained a significant amount of the variance in almost all of the all years models total seasonal precipitation was not found to explain a significant amount of the variance in any of the other climatic periods the other two prism variables that were found to be important were precipitation during the month of peak discharge and precipitation during the month prior to and during the month of peak discharge these variables were most important during average years appearing in at least one model for each one of the hydrologic variables the continental scale teleconnection that appeared in the most models was february nao which appeared in 8 of the models and 27 of the dry years models the next most important teleconnections were december and january pna these variables appeared in 5 and 4 of the models and 18 and 11 of the wet years models respectively overall pna appeared in slightly more models than nao 16 versus 13 in the majority of the models both nao and pna are positively correlated with the dependent variable indicating stormflow and flashiness will be greatest when the positive phases of the two patterns coincide 5 discussion 5 1 watershed geomorphology it was initially hypothesized that the geomorphic characteristics of the study watersheds i e slope would explain the majority of the variance in stormflow the results indicate that the geomorphic differences between the study watersheds explain the majority of the inter basin spatial variance in regional stormflow these results are similar to a study by julian and gardner 2014 that found watershed characteristics become more important than precipitation regime when comparing larger 3rd order watersheds additionally the results of this study indicate that the importance of each geomorphic variable are dependent variable and climatic period specific the standard deviation of the topographic index and melton relief explain the majority of the explained variance in rbi and average slope explains the majority of the explained variance in sfi and pbmax all three of these geomorphic variables explain a significant portion of the explained variance in pbavg but their importance changes depending on whether the season is dry or wet table 7 these findings are similar to those of sidle et al 1995 who found antecedent moisture conditions to influence the stormflow response of forested watersheds near hitachi ohta japan during dry conditions sidle et al 1995 found that areas connected to the stream network were contributing the majority of stormflow to the streams while during wet years hillslopes became the main contributor the shifting importance of melton relief and average slope indicates that there also may be a wetness threshold in the sbrm where watershed characteristics that influence the flashiness of stormflow melton relief are influencing peak flows during average and wet years and watershed characteristics that favor runoff average slope are influencing peak flow during dry years another interpretation is that the wetness threshold may not be related to where the runoff is coming from but the relationship between runoff and baseflow zecharias and brutsaert 1988 zecharias and brutsaert 1988 found average watershed slope to be positively correlated with and a significant predictor of groundwater outflow during dry years the importance of average slope may indicate that there is likely a reduction in baseflow that would cause a relative increase in the average peak flow to baseflow ratio peakdaily is influenced by the entire stream gradient drainage shape and the standard deviation of the topographic index the influence drainage shape has on peakdaily is not surprising and agrees with earlier literature studying flood wave propagation gregory and walling 1973 the importance of the entire stream gradient and the standard deviation of the topographic index is more complex and is likely related to their relationships to drainage density mcdonald 2017 regionally drainage density is negatively correlated with entire stream gradient and positively correlated with the standard deviation of the topographic index the importance of the entire stream gradient and the standard deviation of the topographic index and their correlations with drainage density suggest that peak discharge will be flashier in watersheds where drainage density is low these findings are contrary to previous research that has found a positive relationship between drainage density and peak flow carlston 1963 gregory and walling 1968 the negative relationship between drainage density and relative relief is not novel to the sbrm and a similar relationship has been found in the mountains of japan oguchi 1997 and through experimental methods by tucker and bras 1998 oguchi 1997 concluded that the negative correlation between drainage density and relative relief was due to the influence shallow landslides have on headwater areas of watersheds though studies of debris flows in the sbrm have found a relatively short recurrence interval for debris flows if the whole region is taken into account wieczorek et al 2000 eaton et al 2003 the negative relationship between drainage density and relief is likely due to the saturation threshold theory for channel initiation posited by tucker and bras 1998 the steep hillslopes and relatively flat valley bottoms that characterize the southern blue ridge mountains will quickly transfer subsurface flow through the relatively thick saprolite found on the hillslopes to the relatively flat valley bottoms the saturation threshold for channel initiation will not be exceeded until the subsurface flow reaches the relatively flat valley bottoms thus imposing a limit on drainage density as hypothesized by montgomery and dietrich 1989 the results of this analysis indicate that in humid mountainous regions i e japan and the sbrm high drainage density may not always be positively correlated with high flood peaks due to a reduction in drainage density in smaller flashier watersheds due to either mass wasting near headwater streams japan or due to a saturation threshold for stream channel initiation in the southern blue ridge mountains total seasonal flashiness rbi is influenced by the standard deviation of the topographic index melton relief and the standard deviation of slope the influence of these variables is interpreted as melton relief contributing to the flashiness of the large events due to its influence on peak flashiness and the standard deviation of the topographic index and the standard deviation of slope describing the connectedness of hillslope runoff to the stream network while flashiness tends to decrease with increasing drainage area baker et al 2004 the importance of the melton relief suggests that at least in mountainous areas relative relief is a more important driver of flashiness than just the amount of land draining to the outlet these results are significant because the studies that utilize rbi often do not include geomorphic variables besides drainage area in their models e g poff et al 2006 dow 2007 and attribute differences in rbi solely to the impact of land cover while land cover is likely influencing the flashiness of the streams in these studies the geomorphology of those basins could also be having a significant influence that is completely overlooked the importance of average slope appearing in 10 of the models is not surprising and is likely related to the infiltration and storage potential of the landscape similar to the findings of hewlitt and hibbert 1967 a study of the relationship between soil and geomorphology in the eastern sbrm found a strong negative correlation between soil thickness and slope graham et al 1990 these conditions would favor runoff over infiltration in steep watersheds which agrees with the results of this analysis additionally during dry years when infiltration rates and capacity are likely more important average slope explains a significant amount of the explained variance in pbavg these findings indicate that the characteristics of peak runoff may be related to an infiltration threshold above which the connectedness of the landscape becomes more important than infiltration rates and capacity 5 2 land use land cover it was initially hypothesized that development and grasslands in the alluvial bottomlands would have the most influence on stormflow during dry years the results indicate that roads and grasslands in the alluvial bottomlands do influence stormflow in the region during all time periods and not just during dry years interestingly anthropic development on residuum was also found to be an important driver of sfi during all of the climate periods except for dry years the importance of development on residuum is interpreted as a measure of the connectedness of the landscape during average years jones et al 2000 these results show the importance of understanding the whole watershed and determining whether all of the areas that produce runoff are connected to the stream network the importance of roads on alluvium colluvium in the peakdaily rbi and pbavg models indicate that the relatively small area that is covered by roads in the alluvial and colluvial bottomlands is influencing the flashiness of discharge in the region agreeing with the effective impervious area of booth et al 2002 however the importance of development on residuum paints a more complex picture of storm runoff and highlights the importance of the increased connectedness of the landscape caused by development in this case exurbanization outside of the stream network the influence of the other important land cover variable grass on alluvium colluvium on peakdaily and sfi could be due to the lower infiltration rates in pastures found by johnson 1952 and price et al 2011 though it also could be related to the regional prevalence of drainage ditches in the alluvial and colluvial bottomlands glenn 1911 glenn s 1911 usgs monograph suggested that drainage ditches be dug across the bottomlands to quickly route storm water away from the arable land and reduce the impact precipitation events had on the region these drainage ditches are still in use today and similar to the findings of buchanan et al 2013 will expedite stormflow from the surrounding landscape to the rivers and streams increasing the importance of stormflow over baseflow 5 3 climate while the geomorphology and land cover of the study area explain the variance between the watersheds continental scale teleconnections were found to explain the majority of the inter annual variation in the dependent variables the results of this study agree with previous research that found a significant positive correlation between nao and precipitation in the southeastern united states hurrell and van loon 1997 hartley 1999 these results are not surprising as the enhanced pressure gradient between the icelandic low and the azores high that characterizes positive nao creates conditions that favor zonal flow across the southeastern united states and increases the availability of warm moist air from the gulf interestingly with the exception of one model dry years pbavg pna was also found to be positively correlated with stormflow in the region while these results may seem to be contrary to previous research that suggests that the meridional flow that characterizes positive pna should increase the frequency of blocking events and reduce precipitation in the region leathers et al 1991 henderson and robinson 1994 it is this increased frequency of blocking events that is interpreted as increasing stormflow in the region henderson and robinson 1994 found a significant reduction in the number of events during positive phases of pna meridional flow but the storms that did occur were often larger than the more frequent storms that occurred during negative phases of pna zonal flow these storm event characteristics would explain the increased flashiness caused by positive phases of pna in the sbrm additionally with a reduction in the number of storms baseflow will potentially be reduced which will further increase the ratio of stormflow to baseflow when potentially larger storms are affecting the region 6 conclusion the stormflow characteristics flashiness and magnitude of fifteen usgs gaged watersheds in the sbrm were analyzed to determine the drivers of regional stormflow forty five variables describing the geomorphic climatic and land cover characteristics of these gaged basins were used to create multiple regression models describing the amount of variance that could be explained in five stormflow variables peak flashiness peakdaily total flashiness rbi relative amount of stormflow sfi average peak flashiness pbavg and maximum peak flashiness pbmax out of the thousands of potential three variable models sixty best models were chosen to determine the geomorphic climatic and land cover variables that best describe the variance in regional stormflow during all average dry and wet years results indicate that watershed geomorphology by itself explains 40 50 of the inter basin variance in the dependent stormflow variables melton relief basin relief divided by the square root of drainage area and the standard deviation of the topographic index were found to be the main geomorphic drivers of rbi and average slope was found to be the main geomorphic driver of sfi and pbavg though drainage area explains a statistically significant amount of the variation in regional stormflow the importance of melton relief the standard deviation of the topographic index and slope both watershed average and standard deviation indicates that the processes controlling stormflow creation and propagation are much more complex than just the size of the watershed additionally this study found that the climate and basin characteristics that explain variance in the hydrologic variables during periods of wetness and drought are significantly different by segregating average dry and wet years the influence of low infiltration rate capacity land cover types could be seen in the average and dry years models when the high infiltration rate capacity areas that cover the majority of the landscape forested lands are not as actively contributing to runoff the only land cover variables roads development and grassland that were found to be important were those that cover spatially discrete on alluvium colluvium or residuum areas of the study area these findings indicate that variance in regional stormflow can not only be explained by land cover near the stream network on alluvium colluvium but also by land cover far from the stream network on saprolite residuum while the geomorphology of the study area explained much of the variance between the watersheds continental scale teleconnections were found to explain the majority of the inter annual variation in the dependent variables the results of this study agree with previous research that found a significant positive correlation between nao and precipitation in the southeastern united states hurrell and van loon 1997 hartley 1999 an interesting finding is that in the majority of the models pna was also found to be positively correlated with stormflow in the region though these results may seem to be contrary to previous research that suggests that the meridional flow that characterizes positive pna should increase the frequency of blocking events and reduce total precipitation in the region it is this increased frequency of blocking events that is interpreted as increasing stormflow in the region with a reduction in the number of storms due to an increased number of blocking events baseflow will potentially be reduced which will increase the relative importance of stormflow when the potentially larger storms associated with positive pna do occur the results of this study highlight the complexity of southern blue ridge mountain stormflow hydrology
