19850,in order to optimize drinking water production operation membrane users can use several analytical tools that help membrane fouling prediction and alleviate fouling by a proper feed water resource selection however during strong fouling event membrane decision makers still face short term deadline to decide between different options e g optimization of pretreatment or change in feed water quality hence statistical approach might help to better select the most relevant analytical parameter related to fouling potential of a specific resource in order to speed up decision taking in this study the physical and chemical properties and the filtration performances at lab scale of five ground water resources selected as potential resources of a large drinking production site of paris france was evaluated through one year principal component analysis emphasizes the strong link between waters organic matrix and fouling propensity cluster analysis of filtration performances allowed classifying the water samples into three groups exhibiting strong low and intermediate fouling finally multiple linear regressions performed on all collected data indicated that strong fouling events were related to a combined increase of carbon content and protein like substances while intermediate fouling might only be anticipated by an increase of fluorescence signal associated to protein like substances this study demonstrates that advanced data analysis might be a powerful tool to better manage water resources selection used for drinking water production and to forecast filtration performances in a context of water quality degradation graphical abstract image 1 keywords ultrafiltration karst area principal component analysis fluorescence excitation emission matrix cluster

resources are characterized by strong and unpredictable variation of water quality with strong increases of turbidity and dissolved organic carbon doc during rain events pronk et al 2006 furthermore climate simulations project a strong increase in temperature and a decrease of precipitation in many karst regions in the world over the next decades which will likely increase the stress on karst water resource in terms of both quantity and quality hartmann et al 2014 membrane technologies including uf and combination pac uf have been proposed as reliable flexible and cost effective treatments for karst water resources pianta et al 2000 despite widespread application of ultrafiltration uf for drinking water production membrane fouling is one of the main limitations of membrane installations nakatsuka et al 1996 pianta et al 1998 gao et al 2011 several studies were dedicated to membrane fouling understanding and results demonstrated a strong impact of process management i e backwash and chemical cleaning and water quality on filtration performances barbot et al 2009 touffet et al 2015 huang et al 2014 among all parameters natural organic matter nom was found to be the most problematic regarding fouling propensity lee et al 2006 hong and elimelech 1997 amy 2008 more precisely protein and polysaccharides like compounds were found to play a crucial role in membrane fouling zheng et al 2009 2017 however due to widely varying physicochemical properties the prediction and understanding of fouling is difficult consequently membrane users aim at reducing as much as possible nom concentration in membrane feed water by using pre treatment operations coagulation flocculation adsorption prefiltration or by appropriate selection of water resources guigui et al 2002 campinas and rosas 2010 peiris et al 2011 mao et al 2013 hence water quality and nom content have to be monitored using several global organic carbon ph turbidity or more specific analytical tools liquid chromatography with on line organic carbon detection fluorescence excitation emission matrix feem real time data monitoring rtdm of global analytical parameters i e toc uv 254 nm can be used in order to predict and to reduce the impact of nom on membrane fouling vera et al 2017 chen and kim 2006 hamachi et al 1999 curcio et al 2006 wetterau et al 1996 shamsuddin et al 2015 thus a large amount of data needs to be continuously processed using advanced data analysis in order to better adapt membrane pre treatment or filtration process the use of principal component analysis pca could help identifying most relevant parameters regarding membrane fouling for a given water resource peiris et al 2010a 2010b 2012 chen et al 2014 cruz et al 2017 or used to monitor fouling with innovative analytical technique virtanen et al 2017 the important role of colloidal compounds and protein like substances identified by feem in uf fouling was confirmed by pca peiris et al 2010a more recently a framework of uf fouling quantification and classification using advanced data analysis tools pca cluster analysis parafac etc was developed based on data obtained at pilot scale during two years chen et al 2014 the results confirmed the important role of protein like substances and biopolymers on both reversible and irreversible fouling and emphasized that colloidal particulate matter can alleviate the extent of irreversible fouling during filtration of surface water chen et al 2014 recently liu et al 2017 used pca to correlate uf performances regarding different natural waters and confirmed that biopolymers fulvic acid like substances were linked to hydraulic reversible fouling therefore applying advanced data analysis might help membrane users in their choice of feed water resource in order to alleviate membrane fouling and to improve produced water quality the present study aims to use advanced data analysis tools to correlate data obtained from several physicochemical analyses to fouling potential of five different groundwater resources in a karst area and potentially used as drinking water resources for paris france water resources were sampled analyzed and filtered every month in 2012 all generated data more than 1000 were processed through pca cluster analysis and autoregressive integrated moving average arima model in order to develop a filtration performances prediction model based on physical and chemical parameters of the tested resources 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampled waters and analytical tools the five ground water resources situated in the dreux district about 75 km sw of paris france are called erigny foisys graviers nouvet and rivière they are owned by the water company eau de paris and are used as water resource of the saint cloud drinking water production plant the st cloud drinking water treatment plant can produce up to 100 000 m3 per day using a process combining powdered activated carbon and ultrafiltration 360 hollow fiber membrane modules made of cellulose acetate aquasource france as shown on fig 1 the groundwater resources are located close to each other in a karst area region with high soil permeability the flood mapping risk revealed a high risk of sediment flooding and the occurrence of an overlying aquifer the water quality monitoring performed by eau de paris showed that water quality remained stable in dry period but turbidity and fecal indicator bacteria increased significantly during strong rain events data not shown also as indicated on fig 1 three wastewater treatment plants wwtp are close to the five water resource locations approx 2 km each resource was sampled every month at the same day during one year between november 2011 and december 2012 except during august 2012 once received all waters were prefiltered at 200 μm on a steel sieve stored at 4 c in dark before analysis and filtration for a maximum duration of 10 days all water samples were characterized in terms of

uv254 absorbance safas double energy system and fluorescence excitation emission matrix feem using a fluoromax 2 isa jobin yvon spex the feem range was set at 200 400 nm and 300 550 nm for excitation and emission wavelengths respectively these analytical tools were selected because they are already used on site by membranes operators 2 2 description of the bench scale filtration unit and protocol every dead end filtration tests were performed using a new homemade hollow fiber mini module surface area of 29 cm2 made of 4 pristine fibers 25 cm long closed at one end touffet 2014 the fibers were the same as used in the st cloud drinking water treatment plant they are made of cellulose acetate aquasource france with a 100 kda mwco and a pure water flux of 260 40 l h 1 m 2 bar 1 every home made mini modules exhibiting pure water flux higher than 15 of the average value were discarded in order to maximize filtration results reproducibility filtration tests were performed using an automated filtration unit with the same design as used by touffet et al 2015 the maximum transmembrane pressure allowed on the filtration unit was set at 1 1 bars which is lower than the burst pressure of 1 5 bars given by the manufacturer for the evaluation of filtration performances the suspension was filtered at 20 c for 24 h corresponding to 70 filtration cycles each cycle consisted of 20 min of inside out dead end filtration at a constant flow of 96 l h 1 m 2 4 ml min 1 followed by a backwash bw step bw steps were processed using chlorinated permeate at 4 mgcl2 l 1 for 1 min at 92 l h1 m 2 8 ml min 1 these filtration conditions were chosen and adapted to reflect the operating conditions used on site i e filtration flux of 100 l h 1 m 2 interspersed with chlorinated permeate backwash the filtration performances were determined in terms of irreversible fouling rate ifr eq 1 and critical filtered volume cfv defined here as the filtered volume value when the fouling becomes irreversible transmembrane pressure tmp after bw higher than 10 of the initial tmp touffet et al 2015 chen et al 2014 bessiere et al 2005 1 ifr 1 μ 20 c j d p o i p o d t with ifr the irreversible fouling rate m 1 h 1 pi o and po are the tmp pa at the beginning of the i th filtration cycle and the initial tmp virgin membrane respectively μ 20 c is the permeate water viscosity at 20 c pa s and j the filtration flux m3 m 2 h 1 therefore those two parameters were used to characterize the fouling propensity during filtration tests it is important to note that these two parameters are not independent if no irreversible fouling occurred the ifr value was equal to zero and a maximum value of cfv was obtained in such case the maximum value of the cfv was the maximum filtered volume i e around 1900 l m 2 over 24 h filtration run in contrast a strong fouling was represented by a high ifr and small cfv values among all filtration tests the maximum observed ifr values were about 55 m 1 h 1 and the corresponding minimal cfv value was equal to 100 l m 2 the calculated standard variations of cfv and ifr obtained from a repetition test performed on nouvet n 2 and foisys n 2 during january 2012 were equal to 20 and 17 respectively 2 3 statistical analysis approach first feem data were computed using parallel factor analysis usually called parafac thank to the algorithm developed by the protee laboratory university of toulon france on the n way matlab 7 0 toolbox mathworks natick usa this statistical tool allows to construct a three dimensional matrices on all collected fluorescence data matrix dimension excitation emission number of samples alberts and tackacks 2004 filtration results were classified using cluster analysis performed on all ifr and cfv values collected over the year using the ward s method subsequently all analytical results 64 different samples and 16 analytical parameters were correlated to filtration tests data two parameters cfv and ifr using principal component analysis pca performed on a 1152 data matrix 64 18 finally multiple linear regressions mlr were used to develop prediction models of filtration performances of all studied resources from their specific physical and chemical characteristics mlr was performed using the forward backward method based on the bayesian information criterion bic also the autoregressive integrated moving average model arima p d q was applied to forecast nouvet and foisys resources filtration performances the applied parameters to the arima model were the order p equals to 2 d the degree of differencing equals to 1 and q the order of the moving average model defined to 0 all statistical tools used in this study pca cluster analysis mlr arima were computed using r commander software version 1 8 1 with factominer and time series packages husson et al 2008 3 results and discussion 3 1 evolution of water quality the analytical results i e ph toc turbidity major ion concentrations and fluorescence data obtained for each water resource and every month between november 2011 and december 2012 are given in supporting information table s1 toc values shown in fig 2 ranged from 0 5 to 3 6 mg l 1 for all investigated resources throughout the year globally higher toc values were observed for rivière and nouvet two large toc increases were reported in january and october 2012 with toc values ranging from 2 15 to 3 60 mg l 1 an increase in the precipitation level was usually followed by an increase of toc as observed for october 2012 and from february to june 2012 significant snowfall in late december 2011 followed by progressive snow melting during january 2012 would explain the discrepancy between precipitation event and toc increase at that period the uv absorbance at 254 nm followed the same trend as toc with a strong linear correlation between both parameters pearson s r 0 952 n 65 table 1 fig s1 shows that regardless the resource or the sampling period conductivity values were relatively similar and ranged from 368 to 489 μs cm 1 t 20 c the lowest values were obtained during summer 2012 june july due to dilution after high precipitation events at the same period as said before the five studied resources are situated in a karst area and consequently are influenced by rainfall events as with conductivity values concentrations of inorganic species and ph slightly varied over the year table s1 the ph exhibited an average value of 7 4 0 1 for all waters with min and max values of 7 2 and 7 9 respectively the hardness was moderately hard with average calcium concentration of 84 mg l 1 for rivière and nouvet and 90 mg l 1 for erigny foisys and graviers alkalinity varied from 104 mg l 1 as caco3 for nouvet to 188 mg l 1 for erigny average turbidity was 0 77 ntu and maximum values of 2 2 ntu were reported in january and october 2012 for nouvet and graviers table s1 these results further demonstrate that investigated resources are impacted by rainfall important rain events particularly during winter and fall led to an increase of allochtonous organic matter and turbidity due to soil lixiviation during spring and summer the impact of rain events was lower because vegetation reduced soil lixiviation in order to deeply investigate the nom properties throughout the year all water samples were analyzed using feem and computed with parafac as depicted in fig 3 and table s1 three components were extracted from the feem analysis with 99 8 statically convergence and a concordia test over 50 these three components were previously identified by different published works stedmon and markager 2003 yao et al 2011 ishii and boyer 2012 component c1 refers to the fluorophore centered at excitation and emission wavelengths of 250 nm and 470 nm respectively fig 3 left component c2 corresponds to the fluorophore centered at excitation and emission wavelengths of 250 nm and 400 nm respectively fig 3 center components c1 and c2 were attributed to humic and fulvic like substances respectively yang et al 2015 the third component c3 was represented by a fluorophore centered at excitation and emission wavelengths of 225 and 325 nm respectively fig 3 right this fluorophore is usually attributed to protein like substances and exhibits a strong correlation with biochemical oxygen demand baker and genty 1999 the presence of this fluorophore in natural waters was demonstrated to be site dependent and usually associated to organic matter with microbial origin yang et al 2015 hudson et al 2008 her et al 2003 baker 2001 filloux et al 2012 sorensen et al 2016 consequently the component c3 might be due to organic matter from infiltration of secondary effluents discharged by the wwtps located in the area leaching of agricultural surface and or biofilm associated with the sediments of the resources simon et al 2001 pronk et al 2006 the variations of fluorophores c1 and c2 over the year of sampling exhibited similar variation as observed for the toc uv254 and turbidity fig 4 a b table s1 a high pearson s coefficient r over 0 9 was found for both fluorophores c1 and c2 against toc and uv254 parameters table 1 indeed the highest values were observed during january and october 2012 for high rainfall globally the highest fluorescence signals were observed for nouvet and rivière in contrast the c3 fluorophore showed only slight variation throughout the year and did not seem to be directly impacted by rainfall fig 4 c according to table 1 no clear correlation could be drawn between c3 fluorophore and all other investigated parameters thus the origin of nom was mainly allochtonous and component c3 accounted probably for a minor part of the organic carbon to conclude the physical and chemical analysis of the five resources over year 2012 revealed that parameters related to nom uv254 toc fluorophores c1 c2 and particulate content turbidity were strongly impacted by precipitation as it is usually observed for karst area wittmann et al 2002 pronk et al 2006 pianta et al 2000 3 2 filtration performances as an example the results of the 24 h filtration tests obtained with the five waters sampled in may 2012 are reported on fig 5 a the variation of the transmembrane pressure showed typical variations for constant flux filtration peldszus et al 2011 as depicted the five waters can be classified according to their fouling ability for this month as follow nouvet rivière erigny foisys graviers with corresponding cfv values of 168 245 364 638 1001 l m2 and ifr values of 42 7 39 7 29 3 14 7 5 4 m 1 h 1 the reported toc values for this month were very close the highest value being for graviers 1 74 mg l 1 and the lowest for foisys 1 54 mg l 1 with no clear link with the filtration performances indeed according to table 1 ifr and cfv exhibited a pearson correlation coefficient obtained throughout the investigated year against toc lower than 0 8 filtration performances of the five resources over the year and against rainfall are summarized on fig 5 b the highest ifr value of 55 m 1 h 1 with a corresponding cfv equals to 196 l m 2 was obtained for rivière in january 2012 high monthly rainfall during fall or winter induced a strong increase in ifr values for example high rainfall during october 2012 induced high ifr values from 32 to 49 m 1 h 1 for all investigated waters for the sake of comparison an ifr value of 21 2 m 1 h 1 was estimated during the filtration of a surface water doc 5 4 mg l 1 on pvdf hollow fiber membranes in peiris et al 2013 globally the lowest filtration performances high ifr and low cfv were obtained for nouvet and rivière interestingly the best filtration performances low ifr and high cfv were observed during june july 2012 even though rainfalls were exceptionally high at this period of the year to conclude the modification of organic and inorganic matrices due to rainfall events in karst area influence the filtration performances especially during winter season when soil lixiviation is high moreover the results emphasis the difficulty to link data obtained during water monitoring to filtration performances 3 3 statistical analysis in order to simplify data handling and to identify the most relevant parameters that could accurately predict filtration performances intensive data analysis was performed on all collected data firstly all ifr and cfv values determined during the year were classified using hierarchical ascendant classification hac analysis and the ward s method fig 6 clustering dendrogram fig 6 and the total inertia fig s2 show that filtration results could be divided into three groups i e most of the inertia loss was obtained for three classes the first group consisting of 13 water samples named low fouling regroups ifr values equal to 0 m 1 h 1 and high cfv values equal to 1740 l m 2 this first group consist of filtration performances obtained during late summer 2012 graviers and foisys occurred 4 and 5 times in this group respectively the second group called high fouling regroups 19 waters samples with high ifr and low cfv values with values from 24 to 55 m 1 h 1 and 130 364 l m 2 respectively this second group consists mainly on filtration performances of rivière and nouvet waters both occurring 6 times in addition these high ifr values were observed during winters 2011 2012 and early spring 2012 the last group consisting of 32 samples called intermediate fouling regroups all other ifr and cfv values ranged from 1 to 21 m 1 h 1 and 217 1330 l m 2 respectively this third cluster regroups filtration performances observed during late spring and summer 2012 in this cluster erigny occurred 7 times while all other resources appeared 6 times to conclude the hac confirms that winter and early spring are the most problematic period regarding ultrafiltration performances also this classification help to discriminate nouvet and rivière as potential resources for the drinking water process the principal component analysis pca results obtained from all collected data analytical and filtration results are plotted on fig 7 more than 57 of the total system variance were explained by only two components allowing a 2d representation of pca and the total system s variance could be explained by 10 components fig s3 the first component dim1 x axis on fig 7 is strongly correlated to the organic matter parameters toc uv254 c1 c2 c3 and turbidity of the investigated water samples in contrast the second component dim2 y axis on fig 7 is correlated to the inorganic matrix parameters metal species no3 etc of the water samples the conductivity is not well correlated to the inorganic matrix probably due to its really slight variation over the investigated year the pca in fig 7 confirms that the ifr is strongly correlated to the organic matrix of the water samples as expected the cfv values are inversely correlated to the ifr values the ifr is mainly correlated with the toc followed by the uv254 and turbidity table 1 the pearson s correlation coefficients for the fluorescence signals were similar whatever the considered fluorophore ranged from 0 682 to 0 657 table 1 demonstrates that no clear link exists between filtration parameters and one specific analytical result consequently this emphasizes the complexity of fouling phenomena which consists in a combination of several factors globally the cfv parameter is less correlated to the analytical results than the ifr based on this statistical analysis the irreversible fouling of all investigated water samples over the year is strongly related to their organic matter matrix these results confirm that irreversible fouling phenomena is related to the organic matter content as reported in literature guigui et al 2002 chen et al 2014 sorensen et al 2015 ayache et al 2013 pagano et al 2014 liu et al 2017 this observation suggests that model prediction of fouling phenomena should include several physical and chemical parameters in order to better describe fouling event throughout long time period in order to complete this statistical analysis several multiple linear regressions mlr were done on ifr against all investigated parameters related to the organic matrix the best model was found using the forward backward method based on the bayesian information criterion bic results reported in table 2 show that ifr values throughout the year are well modeled by considering toc and component c3 of the fluorescence signal the coefficients are equal to 10 960 and 4 876 for the toc and c3 parameters respectively this prediction model shows an adjusted r2 value of 0 7825 the student s t test shows that toc s coefficient is highly significant pr t 6 71 10 8 table 2 in contrast the student s t test performed on the c3 coefficient returns a high value equals to 0 876 indicating that this parameter is not enough significant to describe alone the ifr parameter in order to better describe fouling phenomena related to seasonal variation the same methodology was applied on the two last clusters obtained from fig 6 intermediate and high fouling corresponding to late spring early summer and winter early spring respectively the best model for the intermediate fouling cluster was obtained with only the c3 parameter table 2 the student s t test reveals that c3 s coefficient is highly significant to describe intermediate fouling propensity observed during late spring early summer high fouling phenomena is also well modeled by the toc and c3 parameters with coefficients equal to 7 095 and 152 820 respectively the student s t test shows that these two coefficients are highly significant to describe high fouling phenomena also this model returns a relatively high adjusted r2 value equals to 0 944 to conclude all data collected from the year of investigation confirms that the waters filtration performances are strongly related to the organic matrix of the investigated karst springs specifically the mlr suggests that an increase in the protein like substances decrease filtration performances and combined increases of toc and protein like substances led to a strong fouling event this point is of great importance in the understanding and the validation of conclusion drawn by many researches in literature one another hand only common analytical parameters were used in this study hence the statistical analysis could only explained fouling by the common analytical parameters employed here i e toc fluorescence moreover investigation of the seasonal change of the collected data might conduct to filtration performances forecast for the coming months as an example the arima 2 1 0 model was used to predict the filtration performances of foisys and nouvet resources for the next coming 6 months fig 8 therefore the ifr forecast for foisys fig 8 a showed high fouling events with a strong variation of ifr during the next 6 months in contrast the ifr forecast for nouvet fig 8 b predicts less variation over the next 6 months with relatively high ifr values corresponding to the cluster called high fouling this forecast suggests that nouvet should not be used for the next coming months while foisys might have its quality strongly changing however as shown in fig 8 the ifr predictions exhibit high confidence interval due to the low number of data used here to process the arima model 13 ifr values for each resource therefore more data should be collected to reduce the confidence interval of the forecasting finally such approach employed for a long period can be used to predict the effect of water quality change on filtration performances due to increase of anthropic activities or climate change indeed a global increase of 30 80 doc has been observed in surface water in northern europe and north america since 1980s and would be linked to temperature increase and to extreme weather events leading strong soil lixiviation and increased bacterial activity pagano et al 2014 therefore based on these increases and the fouling prediction model developed here it appears that in the next 10 years the average ifr value of all investigated resources would increase of about 85 based on doc increase of 30 in ten years consequently most of these groundwater resources would be problematic regarding the ultrafiltration process 4 conclusion the main objective of the present work was to link filtration performances to physical and chemical properties of five underground resources situated into a karst area near paris france all data were computed using advanced data analysis in order to identify the most relevant parameters which could predict membrane fouling whatever the investigated resources results demonstrated a strong relation between precipitation levels and the waters organic matrix specifically the toc and fluorescence signal related to fulvic and humic like substances were strongly correlated and influenced by rainfall event interestingly the investigated resources exhibited a fluorescence signal related to protein like substances with no clear link with meteorological data cluster analysis performed on filtration performances results allowed to classify the five resources into three groups related to their specific fouling potential low high and intermediate in addition results revealed that best filtration performances were obtained during summer nouvet and rivière were found to be the most problematic resources for ultrafiltration pca and mlr confirmed the strong link of filtration performances and the waters organic carbon contents and protein like substances fluorescence signal specifically it was shown that a coupled increase of toc and protein fluorescence signal induced strong degradation of filtration performances with really high irreversible fouling irreversible to chlorinated permeate backwash to conclude this study confirms that fluorescence analysis coupled to advanced data processing is a versatile tool to membrane fouling understanding such methodology should be employed by membranes users to speed up decision making in order to prevent strong fouling event by a better feed water resource selection also in the context of water quality degradation linked to global warming and intensive land use such methodology offers a unique opportunity for filtration performances forecast appendix a supplementary data the following are the supplementary data related to this article mmc1 mmc1 mmc2

close to the five water resource locations approx 2 km each resource was sampled every month at the same day during one year between november 2011 and december 2012 except during august 2012 once received all waters were prefiltered at 200 μm on a steel sieve stored at 4 c in dark before analysis and filtration for a maximum duration of 10 days all water samples were characterized in terms of

uv254 absorbance safas double energy system and fluorescence excitation emission matrix feem using a fluoromax 2 isa jobin yvon spex the feem range was set at 200 400 nm and 300 550 nm for excitation and emission wavelengths respectively these analytical tools were selected because they are already used on site by membranes operators 2 2 description of the bench scale filtration unit and protocol every dead end filtration tests were performed using a new homemade hollow fiber mini module surface area of 29 cm2 made of 4 pristine fibers 25 cm long closed at one end touffet 2014 the fibers were the same as used in the st cloud drinking water treatment plant they are made of cellulose acetate aquasource france with a 100 kda mwco and a pure water flux of 260 40 l h 1 m 2 bar 1 every home made mini modules exhibiting pure water flux higher than 15 of the average value were discarded in order to maximize filtration results reproducibility filtration tests were performed using an automated filtration unit with the same design as used by touffet et al 2015 the maximum transmembrane pressure allowed on the filtration unit was set at 1 1 bars which is lower than the burst pressure of 1 5 bars given by the manufacturer for the evaluation of filtration performances the suspension was filtered at 20 c for 24 h corresponding to 70 filtration cycles each cycle consisted of 20 min of inside out dead end filtration at a constant flow of 96 l h 1 m 2 4 ml min 1 followed by a backwash bw step bw steps were processed using chlorinated permeate at 4 mgcl2 l 1 for 1 min at 92 l h1 m 2 8 ml min 1 these filtration conditions were chosen and adapted to reflect the operating conditions used on site i e filtration flux of 100 l h 1 m 2 interspersed with chlorinated permeate backwash the filtration performances were determined in terms of irreversible fouling rate ifr eq 1 and critical filtered volume cfv defined here as the filtered volume value when the fouling becomes irreversible transmembrane pressure tmp after bw higher than 10 of the initial tmp touffet et al 2015 chen et al 2014 bessiere et al 2005 1 ifr 1 μ 20 c j d p o i p o d t with ifr the irreversible fouling rate m 1 h 1 pi o and po are the tmp pa at the beginning of the i th filtration cycle and the initial tmp virgin membrane respectively μ 20 c is the permeate water viscosity at 20 c pa s and j the filtration flux m3 m 2 h 1 therefore those two parameters were used to characterize the fouling propensity during filtration tests it is important to note that these two parameters are not independent if no irreversible fouling occurred the ifr value was equal to zero and a maximum value of cfv was obtained in such case the maximum value of the cfv was the maximum filtered volume i e around 1900 l m 2 over 24 h filtration run in contrast a strong fouling was represented by a high ifr and small cfv values among all filtration tests the maximum observed ifr values were about 55 m 1 h 1 and the corresponding minimal cfv value was equal to 100 l m 2 the calculated standard variations of cfv and ifr obtained from a repetition test performed on nouvet n 2 and foisys n 2 during january 2012 were equal to 20 and 17 respectively 2 3 statistical analysis approach first feem data were computed using parallel factor analysis usually called parafac thank to the algorithm developed by the protee laboratory university of toulon france on the n way matlab 7 0 toolbox mathworks natick usa this statistical tool allows to construct a three dimensional matrices on all collected fluorescence data matrix dimension excitation emission number of samples alberts and tackacks 2004 filtration results were classified using cluster analysis performed on all ifr and cfv values collected over the year using the ward s method subsequently all analytical results 64 different samples and 16 analytical parameters were correlated to filtration tests data two parameters cfv and ifr using principal component analysis pca performed on a 1152 data matrix 64 18 finally multiple linear regressions mlr were used to develop prediction models of filtration performances of all studied resources from their specific physical and chemical characteristics mlr was performed using the forward backward method based on the bayesian information criterion bic also the autoregressive integrated moving average model arima p d q was applied to forecast nouvet and foisys resources filtration performances the applied parameters to the arima model were the order p equals to 2 d the degree of differencing equals to 1 and q the order of the moving average model defined to 0 all statistical tools used in this study pca cluster analysis mlr arima were computed using r commander software version 1 8 1 with factominer and time series packages husson et al 2008 3 results and discussion 3 1 evolution of water quality the analytical results i e ph toc turbidity major ion concentrations and fluorescence data obtained for each water resource and every month between november 2011 and december 2012 are given in supporting information table s1 toc values shown in fig 2 ranged from 0 5 to 3 6 mg l 1 for all investigated resources throughout the year globally higher toc values were observed for rivière and nouvet two large toc increases were reported in january and october 2012 with toc values ranging from 2 15 to 3 60 mg l 1 an increase in the precipitation level was usually followed by an increase of toc as observed for october 2012 and from february to june 2012 significant snowfall in late december 2011 followed by progressive snow melting during january 2012 would explain the discrepancy between precipitation event and toc increase at that period the uv absorbance at 254 nm followed the same trend as toc with a strong linear correlation between both parameters pearson s r 0 952 n 65 table 1 fig s1 shows that regardless the resource or the sampling period conductivity values were relatively similar and ranged from 368 to 489 μs cm 1 t 20 c the lowest values were obtained during summer 2012 june july due to dilution after high precipitation events at the same period as said before the five studied resources are situated in a karst area and consequently are influenced by rainfall events as with conductivity values concentrations of inorganic species and ph slightly varied over the year table s1 the ph exhibited an average value of 7 4 0 1 for all waters with min and max values of 7 2 and 7 9 respectively the hardness was moderately hard with average calcium concentration of 84 mg l 1 for rivière and nouvet and 90 mg l 1 for erigny foisys and graviers alkalinity varied from 104 mg l 1 as caco3 for nouvet to 188 mg l 1 for erigny average turbidity was 0 77 ntu and maximum values of 2 2 ntu were reported in january and october 2012 for nouvet and graviers table s1 these results further demonstrate that investigated resources are impacted by rainfall important rain events particularly during winter and fall led to an increase of allochtonous organic matter and turbidity due to soil lixiviation during spring and summer the impact of rain events was lower because vegetation reduced soil lixiviation in order to deeply investigate the nom properties throughout the year all water samples were analyzed using feem and computed with parafac as depicted in fig 3 and table s1 three components were extracted from the feem analysis with 99 8 statically convergence and a concordia test over 50 these three components were previously identified by different published works stedmon and markager 2003 yao et al 2011 ishii and boyer 2012 component c1 refers to the fluorophore centered at excitation and emission wavelengths of 250 nm and 470 nm respectively fig 3 left component c2 corresponds to the fluorophore centered at excitation and emission wavelengths of 250 nm and 400 nm respectively fig 3 center components c1 and c2 were attributed to humic and fulvic like substances respectively yang et al 2015 the third component c3 was represented by a fluorophore centered at excitation and emission wavelengths of 225 and 325 nm respectively fig 3 right this fluorophore is usually attributed to protein like substances and exhibits a strong correlation with biochemical oxygen demand baker and genty 1999 the presence of this fluorophore in natural waters was demonstrated to be site dependent and usually associated to organic matter with microbial origin yang et al 2015 hudson et al 2008 her et al 2003 baker 2001 filloux et al 2012 sorensen et al 2016 consequently the component c3 might be due to organic matter from infiltration of secondary effluents discharged by the wwtps located in the area leaching of agricultural surface and or biofilm associated with the sediments of the resources simon et al 2001 pronk et al 2006 the variations of fluorophores c1 and c2 over the year of sampling exhibited similar variation as observed for the toc uv254 and turbidity fig 4 a b table s1 a high pearson s coefficient r over 0 9 was found for both fluorophores c1 and c2 against toc and uv254 parameters table 1 indeed the highest values were observed during january and october 2012 for high rainfall globally the highest fluorescence signals were observed for nouvet and rivière in contrast the c3 fluorophore showed only slight variation throughout the year and did not seem to be directly impacted by rainfall fig 4 c according to table 1 no clear correlation could be drawn between c3 fluorophore and all other investigated parameters thus the origin of nom was mainly allochtonous and component c3 accounted probably for a minor part of the organic carbon to conclude the physical and chemical analysis of the five resources over year 2012 revealed that parameters related to nom uv254 toc fluorophores c1 c2 and particulate content turbidity were strongly impacted by precipitation as it is usually observed for karst area wittmann et al 2002 pronk et al 2006 pianta et al 2000 3 2 filtration performances as an example the results of the 24 h filtration tests obtained with the five waters sampled in may 2012 are reported on fig 5 a the variation of the transmembrane pressure showed typical variations for constant flux filtration peldszus et al 2011 as depicted the five waters can be classified according to their fouling ability for this month as follow nouvet rivière erigny foisys graviers with corresponding cfv values of 168 245 364 638 1001 l m2 and ifr values of 42 7 39 7 29 3 14 7 5 4 m 1 h 1 the reported toc values for this month were very close the highest value being for graviers 1 74 mg l 1 and the lowest for foisys 1 54 mg l 1 with no clear link with the filtration performances indeed according to table 1 ifr and cfv exhibited a pearson correlation coefficient obtained throughout the investigated year against toc lower than 0 8 filtration performances of the five resources over the year and against rainfall are summarized on fig 5 b the highest ifr value of 55 m 1 h 1 with a corresponding cfv equals to 196 l m 2 was obtained for rivière in january 2012 high monthly rainfall during fall or winter induced a strong increase in ifr values for example high rainfall during october 2012 induced high ifr values from 32 to 49 m 1 h 1 for all investigated waters for the sake of comparison an ifr value of 21 2 m 1 h 1 was estimated during the filtration of a surface water doc 5 4 mg l 1 on pvdf hollow fiber membranes in peiris et al 2013 globally the lowest filtration performances high ifr and low cfv were obtained for nouvet and rivière interestingly the best filtration performances low ifr and high cfv were observed during june july 2012 even though rainfalls were exceptionally high at this period of the year to conclude the modification of organic and inorganic matrices due to rainfall events in karst area influence the filtration performances especially during winter season when soil lixiviation is high moreover the results emphasis the difficulty to link data obtained during water monitoring to filtration performances 3 3 statistical analysis in order to simplify data handling and to identify the most relevant parameters that could accurately predict filtration performances intensive data analysis was performed on all collected data firstly all ifr and cfv values determined during the year were classified using hierarchical ascendant classification hac analysis and the ward s method fig 6 clustering dendrogram fig 6 and the total inertia fig s2 show that filtration results could be divided into three groups i e most of the inertia loss was obtained for three classes the first group consisting of 13 water samples named low fouling regroups ifr values equal to 0 m 1 h 1 and high cfv values equal to 1740 l m 2 this first group consist of filtration performances obtained during late summer 2012 graviers and foisys occurred 4 and 5 times in this group respectively the second group called high fouling regroups 19 waters samples with high ifr and low cfv values with values from 24 to 55 m 1 h 1 and 130 364 l m 2 respectively this second group consists mainly on filtration performances of rivière and nouvet waters both occurring 6 times in addition these high ifr values were observed during winters 2011 2012 and early spring 2012 the last group consisting of 32 samples called intermediate fouling regroups all other ifr and cfv values ranged from 1 to 21 m 1 h 1 and 217 1330 l m 2 respectively this third cluster regroups filtration performances observed during late spring and summer 2012 in this cluster erigny occurred 7 times while all other resources appeared 6 times to conclude the hac confirms that winter and early spring are the most problematic period regarding ultrafiltration performances also this classification help to discriminate nouvet and rivière as potential resources for the drinking water process the principal component analysis pca results obtained from all collected data analytical and filtration results are plotted on fig 7 more than 57 of the total system variance were explained by only two components allowing a 2d representation of pca and the total system s variance could be explained by 10 components fig s3 the first component dim1 x axis on fig 7 is strongly correlated to the organic matter parameters toc uv254 c1 c2 c3 and turbidity of the investigated water samples in contrast the second component dim2 y axis on fig 7 is correlated to the inorganic matrix parameters metal species no3 etc of the water samples the conductivity is not well correlated to the inorganic matrix probably due to its really slight variation over the investigated year the pca in fig 7 confirms that the ifr is strongly correlated to the organic matrix of the water samples as expected the cfv values are inversely correlated to the ifr values the ifr is mainly correlated with the toc followed by the uv254 and turbidity table 1 the pearson s correlation coefficients for the fluorescence signals were similar whatever the considered fluorophore ranged from 0 682 to 0 657 table 1 demonstrates that no clear link exists between filtration parameters and one specific analytical result consequently this emphasizes the complexity of fouling phenomena which consists in a combination of several factors globally the cfv parameter is less correlated to the analytical results than the ifr based on this statistical analysis the irreversible fouling of all investigated water samples over the year is strongly related to their organic matter matrix these results confirm that irreversible fouling phenomena is related to the organic matter content as reported in literature guigui et al 2002 chen et al 2014 sorensen et al 2015 ayache et al 2013 pagano et al 2014 liu et al 2017 this observation suggests that model prediction of fouling phenomena should include several physical and chemical parameters in order to better describe fouling event throughout long time period in order to complete this statistical analysis several multiple linear regressions mlr were done on ifr against all investigated parameters related to the organic matrix the best model was found using the forward backward method based on the bayesian information criterion bic results reported in table 2 show that ifr values throughout the year are well modeled by considering toc and component c3 of the fluorescence signal the coefficients are equal to 10 960 and 4 876 for the toc and c3 parameters respectively this prediction model shows an adjusted r2 value of 0 7825 the student s t test shows that toc s coefficient is highly significant pr t 6 71 10 8 table 2 in contrast the student s t test performed on the c3 coefficient returns a high value equals to 0 876 indicating that this parameter is not enough significant to describe alone the ifr parameter in order to better describe fouling phenomena related to seasonal variation the same methodology was applied on the two last clusters obtained from fig 6 intermediate and high fouling corresponding to late spring early summer and winter early spring respectively the best model for the intermediate fouling cluster was obtained with only the c3 parameter table 2 the student s t test reveals that c3 s coefficient is highly significant to describe intermediate fouling propensity observed during late spring early summer high fouling phenomena is also well modeled by the toc and c3 parameters with coefficients equal to 7 095 and 152 820 respectively the student s t test shows that these two coefficients are highly significant to describe high fouling phenomena also this model returns a relatively high adjusted r2 value equals to 0 944 to conclude all data collected from the year of investigation confirms that the waters filtration performances are strongly related to the organic matrix of the investigated karst springs specifically the mlr suggests that an increase in the protein like substances decrease filtration performances and combined increases of toc and protein like substances led to a strong fouling event this point is of great importance in the understanding and the validation of conclusion drawn by many researches in literature one another hand only common analytical parameters were used in this study hence the statistical analysis could only explained fouling by the common analytical parameters employed here i e toc fluorescence moreover investigation of the seasonal change of the collected data might conduct to filtration performances forecast for the coming months as an example the arima 2 1 0 model was used to predict the filtration performances of foisys and nouvet resources for the next coming 6 months fig 8 therefore the ifr forecast for foisys fig 8 a showed high fouling events with a strong variation of ifr during the next 6 months in contrast the ifr forecast for nouvet fig 8 b predicts less variation over the next 6 months with relatively high ifr values corresponding to the cluster called high fouling this forecast suggests that nouvet should not be used for the next coming months while foisys might have its quality strongly changing however as shown in fig 8 the ifr predictions exhibit high confidence interval due to the low number of data used here to process the arima model 13 ifr values for each resource therefore more data should be collected to reduce the confidence interval of the forecasting finally such approach employed for a long period can be used to predict the effect of water quality change on filtration performances due to increase of anthropic activities or climate change indeed a global increase of 30 80 doc has been observed in surface water in northern europe and north america since 1980s and would be linked to temperature increase and to extreme weather events leading strong soil lixiviation and increased bacterial activity pagano et al 2014 therefore based on these increases and the fouling prediction model developed here it appears that in the next 10 years the average ifr value of all investigated resources would increase of about 85 based on doc increase of 30 in ten years consequently most of these groundwater resources would be problematic regarding the ultrafiltration process 4 conclusion the main objective of the present work was to link filtration performances to physical and chemical properties of five underground resources situated into a karst area near paris france all data were computed using advanced data analysis in order to identify the most relevant parameters which could predict membrane fouling whatever the investigated resources results demonstrated a strong relation between precipitation levels and the waters organic matrix specifically the toc and fluorescence signal related to fulvic and humic like substances were strongly correlated and influenced by rainfall event interestingly the investigated resources exhibited a fluorescence signal related to protein like substances with no clear link with meteorological data cluster analysis performed on filtration performances results allowed to classify the five resources into three groups related to their specific fouling potential low high and intermediate in addition results revealed that best filtration performances were obtained during summer nouvet and rivière were found to be the most problematic resources for ultrafiltration pca and mlr confirmed the strong link of filtration performances and the waters organic carbon contents and protein like substances fluorescence signal specifically it was shown that a coupled increase of toc and protein fluorescence signal induced strong degradation of filtration performances with really high irreversible fouling irreversible to chlorinated permeate backwash to conclude this study confirms that fluorescence analysis coupled to advanced data processing is a versatile tool to membrane fouling understanding such methodology should be employed by membranes users to speed up decision making in order to prevent strong fouling event by a better feed water resource selection also in the context of water quality degradation linked to global warming and intensive land use such methodology offers a unique opportunity for filtration performances forecast appendix a supplementary data the following are the supplementary data related to this article mmc1 mmc1 mmc2

19851,the transport of nano scale iron particles nip in fractures is of concern for remediation of both fractured aquifers and porous aquifers when hydro fracking and flow in preferential pathways takes place in this study the transport of various nip in a natural discrete fractured chalk core was investigated and their mass recoveries calculated four different types of nip were tested and characterized in two ionic strength is solutions at a particle concentration of 100 200 mg l the effect of is stability sedimentation rate particle size solution viscosity and stabilizer were studied nip stability ranged from 1 to 100 following 120 min of stability tests and recoveries ranged from about 6 to 69 the stabilizer type and concentration were shown to have significant role in nip recoveries especially at increased is it was evident that gravitational stability is the most crucial factor dominating transport of nip accordingly stability tests were shown to be a reliable indicator of nip mobility the high recoveries of some nip tested combined with the lack of clogging effect illustrates the enhanced mobility of nip in fractures the wide range of recoveries indicates nip transport manipulation potential in such media we therefore suggest that application of nip in contaminated fractures has considerable potential as a remediation measure in order to achieve nip distribution in the aquifer while avoiding leakage to the environment nip stabilizer concentration should be adjusted according to the site specific hydrogeochemical properties of the contaminated

introduction the protection and cleanup of water resources is a well established need fractured bedrock aquifers are among globally important water sources as 20 25 of the world s groundwater resources rely on bedrock aquifers ford and williams 2013 fractured bedrock aquifers are very susceptible to pollution and instances of their contamination has been documented ford and williams 2013 peters and blum 2003 nativ et al 1999 yu et al 2006 the cleanup and remediation of fractured media is a complex task the heterogeneity in naturally fractured systems makes it difficult to locate contamination sources and map its migration moreover the slow release of contaminants accumulated in the low permeability fractured rock matrix does not allow for an immediate treatment of source contamination goldstein et al 2004 mutch et al 1993 mackay and cherry 1989 nativ et al 1999 therefore a technology which injects treatment material directly into the aquifer is in many cases favorable compared to the commonly used pump and treat method goldstein et al 2004 mutch et al 1993 one of the innovative techniques for groundwater remediation involves the use of engineered nanoparticles enp due to their small size enp are highly reactive as a result of high surface area per mass karn et al 2009 the enp small size also enables their direct injection into the aquifer where they are expected to migrate with groundwater flow karn et al 2009 tratnyek and johnson 2006 to date the most widely studied enps for groundwater treatment are iron nanoparticles nip and in particular nano zero valent iron particles nzvi nzvi particles are highly reactive and can effectively degrade a variety of environmental contaminants crane and scott 2012 and references therein despite the high potential of nip for in situ remediation there are still some drawbacks to its usage the high surface area of nip and the magnetic properties of nzvi promote particle agglomeration and adherence to solid surfaces resulting in limited stability in solution and thus limited migration in groundwater phenrat et al 2007b saleh et al 2007 the effectiveness of in situ groundwater remediation by nanoparticles depends to a great extent on their mobility in the subsurface crane and scott 2012 and references therein to improve nip stability many surface modification methods are used which rely on creating steric electrostatic hydrophobic particle particle repulsion and particle collector repulsion e g zhao et al 2016 and references therein nip stability is also influenced by both in situ hydrochemical and hydrogeological factors hydrochemical parameters include the solution ionic strength is and ionic composition laumann et al 2013 saleh and kim 2008 tosco et al 2012 hydrogeological parameters include flow rate aquifer medium material aquifer pore size and pore size distribution he et al 2009 kocur et al 2013 laumann et al 2013 phenrat et al 2010 zhang et al 2015 increasing the is for instance was shown by several authors to decrease particles mobility e g laumann et al 2013 petosa et al 2010 saleh and kim 2008 increased is causes electrical double layer screening thereby inducing faster particle aggregation and increased interaction with the aquifer matrix the influence of the aquifer matrix material on nip transport was demonstrated in a number of studies natural media including soil carbonate sand and metal oxide coated sand was shown to notably decrease particle mobility in comparison to pure silica sand e g he et al 2009 laumann et al 2013 zhang et al 2015 using a heterogeneous medium phenrat et al 2010 displayed how the existence of preferential flow pathways increased nzvi mobility a higher flow rate yields greater hydrodynamic shear forces on nzvi thereby decreasing the likelihood of the particle aquifer interactions and promoting nzvi mobility phenrat et al 2010 high flow rates and preferential flow pathways are often observed in places where mass transport is dominated by fracture flow zhang et al 2012 in fact one commonly used technique for the injection of nip into the subsurface is hydro fracturing the target porous media first then introducing an nip slurry crane and scott 2012 zhao et al 2016 fractured systems in many cases enable fast migration of solutes and colloids in groundwater e g zvikelsky and weisbrod 2006 zhang et al 2012 colloid transport in fractures was mostly investigated to understand migration of contaminants attached to mobile colloids as well as pathogen transport e g albarran et al 2013 tang and weisbrod 2009 tran et al 2015 zhang et al 2012 however colloids in general and enps in particular could be used for groundwater remediation as well colloids in fractures usually travel faster than solutes due to their lack of diffusion into matrix size exclusion anion exclusion and taylor dispersion zvikelsky et al 2008 in general colloids in the nanometer size range were observed to travel slower and have lower recovery in respect to larger colloids approaching the micrometer range this observation was mostly related to higher brownian motion of the small colloids and the fact that due to their size they can in some cases penetrate and strain in small critical necks cumbie and mckay 1999 zvikelsky and weisbrod 2006 weisbrod et al 2013 although nip are applied in the field in fractured natural or man made systems to the best of our knowledge there are a very few studies exploring the transport mechanism of nip within fractured systems additionally despite the numerous articles available on nip transport in porous media it is unclear to what extent factors like the particle stability size or the aquifer material and is would affect nip mobility in a system dominated by fracture flow fractured media offers the advantages of transmitting particles faster than through porous media but conversely it may introduce challenges such as fracture clogging and reduction in the aquifer hydraulic conductivity on the other hand excess nip mobility may lead to particle leakage to the environment and therefore fail to treat source contamination slowly released from the rock matrix in this study we tested the stability and mobility of various types of nip in a naturally fractured chalk core the influence of is and stabilizer type and concentration on nip mobility was explored as well we aim to investigate the relationship between nip properties their stability in different is solutions and their mobility in fractures 2 materials and methods 2 1 nips tested four different

2007 table 1 cic nzvi b and the unstabilized go were added with 3 g l carboxymethyl cellulose cmc 90 kg mol sigma aldrich see details in supplementary information the high cmc concentration was used for maximum stability as was evident by preliminary tests nip that were already provided with an organic stabilizer from the manufacturer i e paa nzvi and go ha table 1 and paragraph above were not additionally supplemented with a stabilizer nip were studied at a concentration of 200 mg l apart from experiments 16 17 table 2 which were conducted at a particle concentration of 100 mg l see supplementary information these concentrations are lower than those usually used in the field and were chosen due to the possibility of directly quantifying processes like aggregation and sedimentation despite the lower concentrations general trends and differences between the various nip and stabilizer treatments can be deduced from the experiments nips that were found to be stable i

aperture value of 507 85 21 27 μm corresponding to an average hydraulic fv of 39 76 1 66 ml calculating fv prior to and following each experiment allowed for confirmation that no substantial changes in fracture aperture occurred during the experiment due to dissolution sedimentation or fluid shear forces while flushing additionally fv calculation was used to normalize tracer solution injection time and ensure that an equal injection volume was used for each experiment further details on the chalk core maintenance can be found in supplementary information 2 5 nip transport experiment procedure overall 18 experiments were conducted where different nip stabilizers were tested see table 2 for the complete list nip injection time in most transport experiments was 5 09 0 13 hydraulic fv experiment 6 was run for 4 7 fv and experiments 7 8 for 4 4 fv in some of these experiments more details in section 2 6 bromide was injected with the nip to compare their breakthrough curves btc with a non reactive solute tracer table 2 the experiments were also compared to experiments where uranine alone was injected as a solute tracer section 2 6 except for paa nzvi which yielded very low particle recovery and was run once at least two repetitions of each experiment were conducted table 2 summaries all the transport experiments conducted including nip type and concentration stabilizer type and concentration solution and the non reactive tracer used no less than 16 h before a transport experiment was initiated the core was flushed with the experiments background solution and the discharge was set to 1 ml min 0 05 ml min using a low flow rate peristaltic pump gilson minipuls 3 middleton wi usa the flow rate used was in the range of velocities measured in field studies carried out in fractured rocks e g mckay et al 2002 1993 nip suspensions were prepared a day prior to the experiment and all deoxygenated nzvi suspensions were left inside an anaerobic glovebox until the experiment start immediately before the experiment began the nip suspensions were sonicated for 10 min nzvi suspensions were then either placed in an anaerobic tent captair pyramid glove bag cole parmer venon hills il usa or sealed with a two outlet stopper one for nitrogen purging and the other for pumping the solution fig 1 to ensure anaerobic conditions keeping the particles anaerobic preliminary tests revealed conditions within the core to be anaerobic as well throughout the injection time goethite inlet suspensions were stirred by a magnetic stirrer while nzvi suspensions were shaken by an orbital shaker dor 2828 mrc hol il to avoid attachment of nzvi to the magnet the transport experiments were initiated by replacing the background solution in the inlet chambers fig 1 with the relevant nip solution using a high flow rate peristaltic pump master flex l s cole parmer venon hills il usa this enabled a step injection of nip suspension at the fracture inlet following inlet chambers flush the flow rate was restored to 1 ml min using the low flow peristaltic pump and nip injection through the fracture was initiated outflow samples were collected using a fraction collector spectra chrom cf 1 houston tx usa following 5 hydraulic fv inlet chambers were flushed with the background solution using the high flow rate peristaltic pump the flow rate was then changed back to 1 ml min of background solution and sample collection continued for 7 9 more fv at the end of each experiment the core was first flushed with a dispersive solution 0 001 m nacl and finally with arw solution a schematic figure of the fractured chalk experimental setup is given below fig 1 2 6 uranine transport experiments procedure since br has previously been reported to adsorb to ac e g bao et al 1999 cic experiments 1 4 were run without br see table 2 experiments 16 17 were run with br but due to the free fe 2 ions see supplementary information in solution colouring the solution in yellow and the colorimetric method used for br analysis reliable br concentration analysis could not be obtained additionally due to some technicalities in the go ha experiments experiments 5 7 8 and 10 were injected without br and experiment 9 gave suspiciously high br concentration results table s2 therefore in addition to the 18 nip transport experiments conducted a conservative tracer uranine was injected independently under identical conditions to those of the nip experiments for comparison note that uranine could not be used in the nip experiments due to analytical limitations uranine was injected at a concentration of 2 5 mg l overall 5 experiments of this type were conducted in marw table 2 another experiment was conducted in which uranine was injected in arwx10 solution table 2 the experiments were conducted according to the same procedure detailed above for the nip transport experiments 2 7 samples analysis nip concentrations were analyzed by measuring absorbance at 508 nm he and zhao 2007 kocur et al 2013 using a 96 well microplate reader tecan infinite 200 männedorf switzerland it should be noted that except for when settling took place no evidence for the influence of aggregation on absorbance intensity was observed all solutions were exposed to air at the outlet and measured against a calibration curve of the oxidized inlet solution see supplementary information section s4 for details in experiments where br was injected with the particles every third sample was filtered using 0 02 μm millex type filters and analyzed for br br concentrations were analyzed by the phenol red colorimetric method eaton et al 1998 using the 96 well microplate reader uranine concentrations were analyzed using fluorescence spectrophotometer varian cary eclipse agilent cal usa or using the 96 well microplate reader 3 results and discussion 3 1 solutions properties stability tests and particle size solutions and nip properties are summarized in table s1 solution densities were similar for all nip solutions with an overall average of 1 0 003 g cm3 the high cmc concentrations increased solution viscosity indicating an average of 2 1 0 2 cp for the cmc stabilized solutions cic cmc go cmc and nzvi b cmc compared with 1 03 0 05 cp for the ha go and paa nzvi solutions cmc shear thinning behavior may result in somewhat different viscosity while flowing through the fracture nevertheless the increased solutions viscosity due to cmc addition is clearly evident nip stability curves are presented in fig 2 a d the different types of nip showed diverse sedimentation behavior cic cmc and go cmc in both solutions and ha go in marw fig 2a c were generally stable and exhibited a low sedimentation rate ha go in arwx10 paa nzvi and cmc nzvi b fig 2c d were less stable and exhibited a higher sedimentation rate the stability curves of the more stable nip consisted of only one constant rate settling region fig 2a c in contrast the stability curves of the unstable nip types consisted of three sedimentation regions fig 2c d indicating formation of aggregates and settling with the exception of paa nzvi which showed a very fast constant aggregation rate similar sedimentation behavior was reported by phenrat et al 2007b the three regions suggest that three different sedimentation stages occur first aggregation takes place this region is characterized by low sedimentation rate the second stage starts at time tcrit table s1 when aggregates reach a critical size and sedimentation becomes rapid finally sedimentation rate becomes slow again and sedimentation of aggregates which did not form critical size takes place nip size results from both dls rh dls and stability curves exponential decay model rh stb eqs s1 s3 presented in table s1 the poor fit r2 0 2 of the exponential model for experiments 1 and 3 5 can be attributed to the somewhat scattered optical density values which are however centered around the same overall values fig 2a b rh dls was measured at the beginning of each experiment following sonication while rh stb was calculated according to the settling rate thus enabling the calculation of average particle size at different stages during the experiment therefore for the stable particles we assume rh dls to be a reliable measure while for the unstable particles rh stb results is presumed to be representative of actual size cic cmc and go cmc average particle size were in the same range for the two is solutions rh dls of about 300 nm and 600 nm respectively table s1 this together with low sedimentation rate observed in the stability tests fig 2a c indicates high particle stability the high cmc concentration contributes to higher cmc layer thickness providing more inter particle electrostatic and steric repulsion and a high amount of free cmc in solution the free cmc additionally reduces aggregation by both interacting with free ions in solution and elevating viscosity thereby reducing brownian motion and subsequently particle collisions li et al 2015 phenrat et al 2007a b tiraferri et al 2008 in contrast to low stabilizer concentration where this phenomenon does not take place the greater cic stability compared to other nip types tested here can also be attributed to its lower density 2 5 g cm3 table s1 and to ac s role as a spacer masking magnetic and electrostatic interactions between nzvi bleyl et al 2012 mackenzie et al 2012 cic size results table s1 are consistent with the primary particle size specified by the manufacturer primary particle size rh50 400 nm mackenzie et al 2012 however go cmc sizes table s1 were slightly greater than those specified by the manufacturer primary particle size rh50 162 65 nm it is possible that the high cmc concentration resulted in the formation of small go cmc aggregates an aggregating effect of organic coatings on iron oxide particles has been reported and attributed to charge neutralization and bridging effect of the coating between single colloids baalousha et al 2008 go ha particles on the other hand did not exhibit aggregation in marw and were measured with the smallest particle size of all particles tested rh dls 201 7 49 6 nm however when the is was elevated go ha particles were destabilized and exhibited high settling rates and very large aggregate formation fig 2c table s1 excess salts in solution and especially free calcium ions causes compression of the double layer and an increase in particle interaction laumann et al 2013 petosa et al 2010 saleh and kim 2008 tiraferri et al 2008 the different behavior of the go particles coated by the different stabilizers stems from both the difference in concentration and type of stabilizer ha was reported before as a less effective stabilizer than cmc inducing a less negative charge to the nanoparticles surface liu et al 2016 and the low ha concentration did not influence viscosity table s1 therefore at low is ha at low concentration was found to be an efficient stabilizer as demonstrated by the lack of go ha aggregation primary particle size as specified by the manufacture was 325 nm however when the is was increased the low ha concentration was not sufficient to stop aggregation from occurring stability of nzvi b particles varied from one experiment to another fig 2d tables s1 and s2 the different settling behavior can be attributed to small changes in suspension preparation unlike the other particles which always came from the same stock nzvi b was always prepared the day before the transport experiment this may have resulted in different particle size and morphology hwang et al 2011 in our experiments calculated rh stb indicated an aggregate size in the range on 1000 2000 nm primary particle size reported in the literature for these kind of particles is 11 80 nm he et al 2009 2010 he and zhao 2007 hwang et al 2011 li et al 2015 while some authors reported the formation of very stable particles in the range of a few tens of nm he et al 2009 2010 he and zhao 2007 other studies reported large aggregate formation in the μm range depending on solution viscosity is and method of preparation hwang et al 2011 li et al 2015 in contrast to cic cmc and go cmc nzvi b cmc exhibited increased particle aggregation despite the high cmc concentrations applied go particles are characterized by very low magnetization and cic particles have ac as a spacer masking magnetic attractive forces in contrast nzvi b are characterized by magnetic attractive forces between bare fe0 particles causing increased aggregation petosa et al 2010 phenrat et al 2007a the small primary particle size of nzvi b results in greater surface area contributing further to its increased aggregation moreover the high nonbonding cmc concentration could cause a bridging effect between particles during the particle production process as was illustrated by cirtiu et al 2011 for nzvi b cmc paa nzvi was the fastest to settle and quickest to aggregate at a constant rate table s2 fig 2d laumann et al 2013 observed extensive aggregation of this type of nip with a mean particle size of 1600 1400 nm when in solution we could observe these particles forming large aggregates up to few hundred microns and settling rapidly therefore only one experiment was performed with this nip type similarly to the nzvi b particles paa nzvi exhibits magnetic forces between particles and has a very small primary particle diameter 50 nm however the very low stabilizer concentration is not sufficient to entrap particles and prevent further aggregation from occurring moreover paa was reported to have a less effective stabilizing effect than cmc due to the lower negative charge induced by it cirtiu et al 2011 raychoudhury et al 2010 which ultimately resulted in low particle stability 3 2 transport experiments 3 2 1 nip arrival time and decay btcs of nip transport experiments together with average uranine and average br btcs are presented in fig 4 when comparing uranine and br breakthrough it can be observed that uranine has an earlier breakthrough than br fig 3 table s2 br molecules have a smaller size and hence higher diffusion coefficient witthûser et al 2000 resulting in br increased diffusivity into the matrix all nip arrived at the outlet earlier than br this phenomenon has been reported for clay colloids viruses and latex microspheres e g albarran et al 2013 cumbie and mckay 1999 weisbrod et al 2013 zvikelsky and weisbrod 2006 it is the result of size exclusion from small aperture zones and matrix and transport mainly in the center of streamlines taylor dispersion leading to faster transport of colloids than of solutes in fractures the first arrival time of all cmc stabilized nip was later than that of uranine and go ha injected without cmc late arrival was also observed for br injected with the cmc stabilized solution compared to br injected with non cmc stabilized solutions fig 4 table s2 this is because of the cmc stabilized solution s higher viscosity imposed a higher shear force leading to slower transport velocity of particles and solutes several studies reported an ideal particle aggregate size for transport in fractures in the range of 200 500 nm cumbie and mckay 1999 tran et al 2015 zvikelsky and weisbrod 2006 the average size of go ha in marw 400 nm table s1 was within that size range which further explains its relatively fast transport and high recoveries table s2 all nip concentration decay was sharp and no tailing was observed indicating the lack of matrix diffusion this was expected as the nip aggregate size tested here few hundred to several thousands of nm table s3 was much greater than the average pore throat value of chalk 150 nm zvikelsky and weisbrod 2006 this in contrast to the tailing observed by the soluble tracers attributed to back diffusion from the matrix 3 2 2 the correlation of btcs and stability tests breakthrough of the different nip types correlated with stability test results where the more stable nip suspensions demonstrated greater recovery this was evident by comparing stability test results in i i0 values at 120 min when most particles have reached their final settling rate to transport experiment recovery values r2 0 91 for all experiments fig 3 table s2 when experiments of similar is are plotted the correlation between recovery and stability increases r2 0 95 for marw and r2 0 97 arwx10 fig 3 this suggests that stability tests are a good tool to use for particle mobility prediction the highest recoveries were observed for go cmc go ha and cic cmc in marw which presented average recoveries of 65 9 4 3 63 4 0 8 62 2 0 6 respectively table s2 these recovery values were in the range of those observed for the soluble tracers 76 9 6 9 for uranine 73 2 1 and 64 2 4 1 for br in the cmc stabilized and the non cmc stabilized solutions respectively however matrix diffusion is likely the reason for the soluble tracers retention whereas nip matrix diffusion is unlikely as explained above section 3 2 1 nzvi paa and nzvi b which demonstrated lower particle stability were also less mobile table s2 although the solutions were agitated in the influent reservoir nips migrating through the fracture can aggregate and settle during their transport the importance of particles stability for transport of nips was demonstrated by raychoudhury et al 2010 who reported that large aggregates formed at higher nip concentrations cause increased particle removal by straining phenrat et al 2010 showed how unstable particles can be deposited in the system clogging the pores and further decreasing nzvi mobility kocur et al 2013 though working with relatively stable 60 100 nm nzvi cmc particles stressed the importance of testing and quantifying particle settling rate for proper nzvi migration prediction and modeling clearly in the case of unstable particles like those in some of the nip suspensions studied here stability tests are of great importance for particle transport prediction 3 2 3 effect of ionic strength in fig 3 it can be observed that all higher is experiment recoveries are shifted downward when compared to the lower is experiments even for similar stability values thus increased is is shown to reduce recoveries even in cases when it does not impact particle stability higher is induces compaction of the double layer and screening of particles electrostatic repulsion thereby promoting nip carrier interactions petosa et al 2010 saleh and kim 2008 tosco et al 2012 hence it can be deduced that at higher is interception increases when the effect of is on the different nip is examined go ha particles experienced the greatest impact go ha breakthrough was dramatically reduced from an average recovery of 63 4 0 8 to 15 2 4 6 when the is was elevated this was mainly the result of aggregation from rh dls 200 nm to calculated rh stb 6500 nm and consequently enhanced deposition fig 2b and table s1 despite the minimal effect of is on stability and size of go cmc and cic cmc fig 2a c and table s1 a decrease in recovery was observed 65 9 4 3 to 51 2 and 62 2 0 6 to 59 4 3 3 respectively fig 4a c due to increased particle collector interactions as explained above the spikes in go ha arwx10 btcs during the onset of nip flushing are probably the result of the unstable particles temporal settling toward the outlet due to the 1 2 min pause in flow section 2 5 and later resuspension by initiation of flow 3 2 4 nips transport mechanism studies reported various governing transport mechanisms for nip in porous media he et al 2009 and tiraferri et al 2008 suggested diffusion dominant transport of small 15 nm and larger particles 300 nm respectively straining was shown by several studies to be significant mainly when aggregation occurred e g raychoudhury et al 2010 saleh et al 2007 other studies illustrated deposition as an important governing process e g laumann et al 2013 phenrat et al 2010 zhang et al 2015 the main mechanisms governing colloid transport in fractures can be straining diffusion settling and interception oswald and ibaraki 2001 weisbrod et al 2013 zhang et al 2012 zvikelsky and weisbrod 2006 straining in this study is unlikely to play a role due to low particle collector size ratio always 0 013 diffusion affects mostly the solutes and to a much lesser extent particles especially particles in the density 2 5 8 g cm3 and size range studied here from rh dls 200 nm to calculated rh stb 6500 nm under these conditions interception and sedimentation are much more likely to be the governing mechanisms however the large fracture aperture size studied here two orders of magnitude more than the nip diameter reduces the likelihood of nip interception by collector interaction therefore combined with the high correlation of nip transport to stability fig 3 it is reasonable to deduce that the main transport mechanism governing nip transport in this study is sedimentation other mechanism affecting particles to lesser extent were witnessed at increased is in stable particles where increased is had little effect on stability reduced recoveries were still witnessed section 3 2 3 this observation suggests that interception played a higher role in nip transport at increased is see above section 3 2 3 it should be noted that sorption batch tests of the different nip to chalk rock were performed and no sorption during the time scale of the experiment was observed nevertheless at longer time scales sorption was observed see supplementary information section s5 for details despite the large aggregates formed in some of the experiments see table s1 no change in the fracture aperture was observed following the transport experiments and no clogging effect was measured highlighting the potential superior and continuous mobility of nip in fractures it should be noted that while high recoveries of nip in pure pre treated porous media were reported mackenzie et al 2012 he et al 2009 raychoudhury et al 2010 kocur et al 2013 tosco et al 2012 recoveries were markedly lower when natural porous media was tested laumann et al 2013 he et al 2009 zhang et al 2015 in fractured media on the other hand the occurrence of large conduits and in many cases high flow rates zhang et al 2012 may lead to high breakthrough of the stable nip suspensions section 3 2 2 4 conclusions this study deals with nip transport in natural carbonate fractured media in low and higher is to the best of our knowledge the literature has scarce experimental work in this environment we demonstrate how various nips will migrate in fractures under different is the most dominant factor controlling nip mobility was found to be particle stability nip stability controls their travel distance and recovery rates in fact stability tests proved to be a reliable predictor for particle mobility in fractures the nip stabilizer type and concentration were shown to greatly impact the nip stability and hence mobility this was especially prominent at increased is where the mobility is expected to be much lower cmc was demonstrated as a very efficient stabilizer and increasing its concentration lead to greater nip stability also nips that lack or could mask magnetic interactions were shown to be much more mobile go and cic it is evident that stable nips could potentially travel through fractures further than reported for porous media and avoid substantial clogging and attenuation caused by diffusion straining and interception manipulating nip stability by changing stabilizer type and or concentration along with the additional tests of aquifer groundwater flow parameters could yield very diverse transport behavior distance traveled sedimentation along the route and distribution the option of manipulating nip transport is advantageous for efficient application in fractured bedrock considering 25 of groundwater withdrawal worldwide is from fractured aquifers the increased use of hydro fracking fractured systems typical complexity and heterogeneity and the massive contamination of fractured rocks mackay and cherry 1989

19851,the transport of nano scale iron particles nip in fractures is of concern for remediation of both fractured aquifers and porous aquifers when hydro fracking and flow in preferential pathways takes place in this study the transport of various nip in a natural discrete fractured chalk core was investigated and their mass recoveries calculated four different types of nip were tested and characterized in two ionic strength is solutions at a particle concentration of 100 200 mg l the effect of is stability sedimentation rate particle size solution viscosity and stabilizer were studied nip stability ranged from 1 to 100 following 120 min of stability tests and recoveries ranged from about 6 to 69 the stabilizer type and concentration were shown to have significant role in nip recoveries especially at increased is it was evident that gravitational stability is the most crucial factor dominating transport of nip accordingly stability tests were shown to be a reliable indicator of nip mobility the high recoveries of some nip tested combined with the lack of clogging effect illustrates the enhanced mobility of nip in fractures the wide range of recoveries indicates nip transport manipulation potential in such media we therefore suggest that application of nip in contaminated fractures has considerable potential as a remediation measure in order to achieve nip distribution in the aquifer while avoiding leakage to the environment nip stabilizer concentration should be adjusted according to the site specific hydrogeochemical properties of the contaminated

introduction the protection and cleanup of water resources is a well established need fractured bedrock aquifers are among globally important water sources as 20 25 of the world s groundwater resources rely on bedrock aquifers ford and williams 2013 fractured bedrock aquifers are very susceptible to pollution and instances of their contamination has been documented ford and williams 2013 peters and blum 2003 nativ et al 1999 yu et al 2006 the cleanup and remediation of fractured media is a complex task the heterogeneity in naturally fractured systems makes it difficult to locate contamination sources and map its migration moreover the slow release of contaminants accumulated in the low permeability fractured rock matrix does not allow for an immediate treatment of source contamination goldstein et al 2004 mutch et al 1993 mackay and cherry 1989 nativ et al 1999 therefore a technology which injects treatment material directly into the aquifer is in many cases favorable compared to the commonly used pump and treat method goldstein et al 2004 mutch et al 1993 one of the innovative techniques for groundwater remediation involves the use of engineered nanoparticles enp due to their small size enp are highly reactive as a result of high surface area per mass karn et al 2009 the enp small size also enables their direct injection into the aquifer where they are expected to migrate with groundwater flow karn et al 2009 tratnyek and johnson 2006 to date the most widely studied enps for groundwater treatment are iron nanoparticles nip and in particular nano zero valent iron particles nzvi nzvi particles are highly reactive and can effectively degrade a variety of environmental contaminants crane and scott 2012 and references therein despite the high potential of nip for in situ remediation there are still some drawbacks to its usage the high surface area of nip and the magnetic properties of nzvi promote particle agglomeration and adherence to solid surfaces resulting in limited stability in solution and thus limited migration in groundwater phenrat et al 2007b saleh et al 2007 the effectiveness of in situ groundwater remediation by nanoparticles depends to a great extent on their mobility in the subsurface crane and scott 2012 and references therein to improve nip stability many surface modification methods are used which rely on creating steric electrostatic hydrophobic particle particle repulsion and particle collector repulsion e g zhao et al 2016 and references therein nip stability is also influenced by both in situ hydrochemical and hydrogeological factors hydrochemical parameters include the solution ionic strength is and ionic composition laumann et al 2013 saleh and kim 2008 tosco et al 2012 hydrogeological parameters include flow rate aquifer medium material aquifer pore size and pore size distribution he et al 2009 kocur et al 2013 laumann et al 2013 phenrat et al 2010 zhang et al 2015 increasing the is for instance was shown by several authors to decrease particles mobility e g laumann et al 2013 petosa et al 2010 saleh and kim 2008 increased is causes electrical double layer screening thereby inducing faster particle aggregation and increased interaction with the aquifer matrix the influence of the aquifer matrix material on nip transport was demonstrated in a number of studies natural media including soil carbonate sand and metal oxide coated sand was shown to notably decrease particle mobility in comparison to pure silica sand e g he et al 2009 laumann et al 2013 zhang et al 2015 using a heterogeneous medium phenrat et al 2010 displayed how the existence of preferential flow pathways increased nzvi mobility a higher flow rate yields greater hydrodynamic shear forces on nzvi thereby decreasing the likelihood of the particle aquifer interactions and promoting nzvi mobility phenrat et al 2010 high flow rates and preferential flow pathways are often observed in places where mass transport is dominated by fracture flow zhang et al 2012 in fact one commonly used technique for the injection of nip into the subsurface is hydro fracturing the target porous media first then introducing an nip slurry crane and scott 2012 zhao et al 2016 fractured systems in many cases enable fast migration of solutes and colloids in groundwater e g zvikelsky and weisbrod 2006 zhang et al 2012 colloid transport in fractures was mostly investigated to understand migration of contaminants attached to mobile colloids as well as pathogen transport e g albarran et al 2013 tang and weisbrod 2009 tran et al 2015 zhang et al 2012 however colloids in general and enps in particular could be used for groundwater remediation as well colloids in fractures usually travel faster than solutes due to their lack of diffusion into matrix size exclusion anion exclusion and taylor dispersion zvikelsky et al 2008 in general colloids in the nanometer size range were observed to travel slower and have lower recovery in respect to larger colloids approaching the micrometer range this observation was mostly related to higher brownian motion of the small colloids and the fact that due to their size they can in some cases penetrate and strain in small critical necks cumbie and mckay 1999 zvikelsky and weisbrod 2006 weisbrod et al 2013 although nip are applied in the field in fractured natural or man made systems to the best of our knowledge there are a very few studies exploring the transport mechanism of nip within fractured systems additionally despite the numerous articles available on nip transport in porous media it is unclear to what extent factors like the particle stability size or the aquifer material and is would affect nip mobility in a system dominated by fracture flow fractured media offers the advantages of transmitting particles faster than through porous media but conversely it may introduce challenges such as fracture clogging and reduction in the aquifer hydraulic conductivity on the other hand excess nip mobility may lead to particle leakage to the environment and therefore fail to treat source contamination slowly released from the rock matrix in this study we tested the stability and mobility of various types of nip in a naturally fractured chalk core the influence of is and stabilizer type and concentration on nip mobility was explored as well we aim to investigate the relationship between nip properties their stability in different is solutions and their mobility in fractures 2 materials and methods 2 1 nips tested four different types of nip were selected for this study table 1 three types of nip were supplied by commercial manufacturers nanofer 25s poly acrylic acid stabilized nzvi paa nzvi carbo iron colloids cic and goethite nanoparticles as an unstabilized powder go and stabilized by humic acid go ha additionally nzvi particles were prepared in the laboratory nzvi b by bh4 reduction modified from he and zhao 2007 table 1 cic nzvi b and the unstabilized go were added with 3 g l carboxymethyl cellulose cmc 90 kg mol sigma aldrich see details in supplementary information the high cmc concentration was used for maximum stability as was evident by preliminary tests nip that were already provided with an organic stabilizer from the manufacturer i e paa nzvi and go ha table 1 and paragraph above were not additionally supplemented with a stabilizer nip were studied at a concentration of 200 mg l apart from experiments 16 17 table 2 which were conducted at a particle concentration of 100 mg l see supplementary information these concentrations are lower than those usually used in the field and were chosen due to the possibility of directly quantifying processes like aggregation and sedimentation despite the lower concentrations general trends and differences between the various nip and stabilizer treatments can be deduced from the experiments nips that were found to be stable i e cic and go see section 3 1 were studied in the two is background solutions used in this study see below section 2 2 the less stable nip nzvi b cmc and paa nzvi see section 3 1 were studied only in the lower salinity background solution see below section 2 2 a detailed description of nip suspension preparation can be found in the supplementary information 2 2 background solutions experiments were conducted in two different is solutions in order to examine the effect of is on nip stability and transport natural groundwater especially in arid and semi arid environments are characterized by

particle size as measured by dls was not representative of average particle size throughout the experiment therefore for those particles the exponential decay of the stability tests see below was used

using an exponential decay model see supplementary information by which rh of the aggregates can be estimated phenrat et al 2007b 2 4 transport experiments apparatus transport experiments were conducted in a discrete fractured chalk core fig 1 detailed description of the core system setup and saturation can be found in zvikelsky and weisbrod 2006 the core and fracture are 43 5 cm long and 18 cm wide hydraulic fracture aperture measurements multiplied by the fracture width and length enabled calculation of the hydraulic fracture volume fv darcy experiments yielded an average fracture aperture value of 507 85 21 27 μm corresponding to an average hydraulic fv of 39 76 1 66 ml calculating fv prior to and following each experiment allowed for confirmation that no substantial changes in fracture aperture occurred during the experiment due to dissolution sedimentation or fluid shear forces while flushing additionally fv calculation was used to normalize tracer solution injection time and ensure that an equal injection volume was used for each experiment further details on the chalk core maintenance can be found in supplementary information 2 5 nip transport experiment procedure overall 18 experiments were conducted where different nip stabilizers were tested see table 2 for the complete list nip injection time in most transport experiments was 5 09 0 13 hydraulic fv experiment 6 was run for 4 7 fv and experiments 7 8 for 4 4 fv in some of these experiments more details in section 2 6 bromide was injected with the nip to compare their breakthrough curves btc with a non reactive solute tracer table 2 the experiments were also compared to experiments where uranine alone was injected as a solute tracer section 2 6 except for paa nzvi which yielded very low particle recovery and was run once at least two repetitions of each experiment were conducted table 2 summaries all the transport experiments conducted including nip type and concentration stabilizer type and concentration solution and the non reactive tracer used no less than 16 h before a transport experiment was initiated the core was flushed with the experiments background solution and the discharge was set to 1 ml min 0 05 ml min using a low flow rate peristaltic pump gilson minipuls 3 middleton wi usa the flow rate used was in the range of velocities measured in field studies carried out in fractured rocks e g mckay et al 2002 1993 nip suspensions were prepared a day prior to the experiment and all deoxygenated nzvi suspensions were left inside an anaerobic glovebox until the experiment start immediately before the experiment began the nip suspensions were sonicated for 10 min nzvi suspensions were then either placed in an anaerobic tent captair pyramid glove bag cole parmer venon hills il usa or sealed with a two outlet stopper one for nitrogen purging and the other for pumping the solution fig 1 to ensure anaerobic conditions keeping the particles anaerobic preliminary tests revealed conditions within the core to be anaerobic as well throughout the injection time goethite inlet suspensions were stirred by a magnetic stirrer while nzvi suspensions were shaken by an orbital shaker dor 2828 mrc hol il to avoid attachment of nzvi to the magnet the transport experiments were initiated by replacing the background solution in the inlet chambers fig 1 with the relevant nip solution using a high flow rate peristaltic pump master flex l s cole parmer venon hills il usa this enabled a step injection of nip suspension at the fracture inlet following inlet chambers flush the flow rate was restored to 1 ml min using the low flow peristaltic pump and nip injection through the fracture was initiated outflow samples were collected using a fraction collector spectra chrom cf 1 houston tx usa following 5 hydraulic fv inlet chambers were flushed with the background solution using the high flow rate peristaltic pump the flow rate was then changed back to 1 ml min of background solution and sample collection continued for 7 9 more fv at the end of each experiment the core was first flushed with a dispersive solution 0 001 m nacl and finally with arw solution a schematic figure of the fractured chalk experimental setup is given below fig 1 2 6 uranine transport experiments procedure since br has previously been reported to adsorb to ac e g bao et al 1999 cic experiments 1 4 were run without br see table 2 experiments 16 17 were run with br but due to the free fe 2 ions see supplementary information in solution colouring the solution in yellow and the colorimetric method used for br analysis reliable br concentration analysis could not be obtained additionally due to some technicalities in the go ha experiments experiments 5 7 8 and 10 were injected without br and experiment 9 gave suspiciously high br concentration results table s2 therefore in addition to the 18 nip transport experiments conducted a conservative tracer uranine was injected independently under identical conditions to those of the nip experiments for comparison note that uranine could not be used in the nip experiments due to analytical limitations uranine was injected at a concentration of 2 5 mg l overall 5 experiments of this type were conducted in marw table 2 another experiment was conducted in which uranine was injected in arwx10 solution table 2 the experiments were conducted according to the same procedure detailed above for the nip transport experiments 2 7 samples analysis nip concentrations were analyzed by measuring absorbance at 508 nm he and zhao 2007 kocur et al 2013 using a 96 well microplate reader tecan infinite 200 männedorf switzerland it should be noted that except for when settling took place no evidence for the influence of aggregation on absorbance intensity was observed all solutions were exposed to air at the outlet and measured against a calibration curve of the oxidized inlet solution see supplementary information section s4 for details in experiments where br was injected with the particles every third sample was filtered using 0 02 μm millex type filters and analyzed for br br concentrations were analyzed by the phenol red colorimetric method eaton et al 1998 using the 96 well microplate reader uranine concentrations were analyzed using fluorescence spectrophotometer varian cary eclipse agilent cal usa or using the 96 well microplate reader 3 results and discussion 3 1 solutions properties stability tests and particle size solutions and nip properties are summarized in table s1 solution densities were similar for all nip solutions with an overall average of 1 0 003 g cm3 the high cmc concentrations increased solution viscosity indicating an average of 2 1 0 2 cp for the cmc stabilized solutions cic cmc go cmc and nzvi b cmc compared with 1 03 0 05 cp for the ha go and paa nzvi solutions cmc shear thinning behavior may result in somewhat different viscosity while flowing through the fracture nevertheless the increased solutions viscosity due to cmc addition is clearly evident nip stability curves are presented in fig 2 a d the different types of nip showed diverse sedimentation behavior cic cmc and go cmc in both solutions and ha go in marw fig 2a c were generally stable and exhibited a low sedimentation rate ha go in arwx10 paa nzvi and cmc nzvi b fig 2c d were less stable and exhibited a higher sedimentation rate the stability curves of the more stable nip consisted of only one constant rate settling region fig 2a c in contrast the stability curves of the unstable nip types consisted of three sedimentation regions fig 2c d indicating formation of aggregates and settling with the exception of paa nzvi which showed a very fast constant aggregation rate similar sedimentation behavior was reported by phenrat et al 2007b the three regions suggest that three different sedimentation stages occur first aggregation takes place this region is characterized by low sedimentation rate the second stage starts at time tcrit table s1 when aggregates reach a critical size and sedimentation becomes rapid finally sedimentation rate becomes slow again and sedimentation of aggregates which did not form critical size takes place nip size results from both dls rh dls and stability curves exponential decay model rh stb eqs s1 s3 presented in table s1 the poor fit r2 0 2 of the exponential model for experiments 1 and 3 5 can be attributed to the somewhat scattered optical density values which are however centered around the same overall values fig 2a b rh dls was measured at the beginning of each experiment following sonication while rh stb was calculated according to the settling rate thus enabling the calculation of average particle size at different stages during the experiment therefore for the stable particles we assume rh dls to be a reliable measure while for the unstable particles rh stb results is presumed to be representative of actual size cic cmc and go cmc average particle size were in the same range for the two is solutions rh dls of about 300 nm and 600 nm respectively table s1 this together with low sedimentation rate observed in the stability tests fig 2a c indicates high particle stability the high cmc concentration contributes to higher cmc layer thickness providing more inter particle electrostatic and steric repulsion and a high amount of free cmc in solution the free cmc additionally reduces aggregation by both interacting with free ions in solution and elevating viscosity thereby reducing brownian motion and subsequently particle collisions li et al 2015 phenrat et al 2007a b tiraferri et al 2008 in contrast to low stabilizer concentration where this phenomenon does not take place the greater cic stability compared to other nip types tested here can also be attributed to its lower density 2 5 g cm3 table s1 and to ac s role as a spacer masking magnetic and electrostatic interactions between nzvi bleyl et al 2012 mackenzie et al 2012 cic size results table s1 are consistent with the primary particle size specified by the manufacturer primary particle size rh50 400 nm mackenzie et al 2012 however go cmc sizes table s1 were slightly greater than those specified by the manufacturer primary particle size rh50 162 65 nm it is possible that the high cmc concentration resulted in the formation of small go cmc aggregates an aggregating effect of organic coatings on iron oxide particles has been reported and attributed to charge neutralization and bridging effect of the coating between single colloids baalousha et al 2008 go ha particles on the other hand did not exhibit aggregation in marw and were measured with the smallest particle size of all particles tested rh dls 201 7 49 6 nm however when the is was elevated go ha particles were destabilized and exhibited high settling rates and very large aggregate formation fig 2c table s1 excess salts in solution and especially free calcium ions causes compression of the double layer and an increase in particle interaction laumann et al 2013 petosa et al 2010 saleh and kim 2008 tiraferri et al 2008 the different behavior of the go particles coated by the different stabilizers stems from both the difference in concentration and type of stabilizer ha was reported before as a less effective stabilizer than cmc inducing a less negative charge to the nanoparticles surface liu et al 2016 and the low ha concentration did not influence viscosity table s1 therefore at low is ha at low concentration was found to be an efficient stabilizer as demonstrated by the lack of go ha aggregation primary particle size as specified by the manufacture was 325 nm however when the is was increased the low ha concentration was not sufficient to stop aggregation from occurring stability of nzvi b particles varied from one experiment to another fig 2d tables s1 and s2 the different settling behavior can be attributed to small changes in suspension preparation unlike the other particles which always came from the same stock nzvi b was always prepared the day before the transport experiment this may have resulted in different particle size and morphology hwang et al 2011 in our experiments calculated rh stb indicated an aggregate size in the range on 1000 2000 nm primary particle size reported in the literature for these kind of particles is 11 80 nm he et al 2009 2010 he and zhao 2007 hwang et al 2011 li et al 2015 while some authors reported the formation of very stable particles in the range of a few tens of nm he et al 2009 2010 he and zhao 2007 other studies reported large aggregate formation in the μm range depending on solution viscosity is and method of preparation hwang et al 2011 li et al 2015 in contrast to cic cmc and go cmc nzvi b cmc exhibited increased particle aggregation despite the high cmc concentrations applied go particles are characterized by very low magnetization and cic particles have ac as a spacer masking magnetic attractive forces in contrast nzvi b are characterized by magnetic attractive forces between bare fe0 particles causing increased aggregation petosa et al 2010 phenrat et al 2007a the small primary particle size of nzvi b results in greater surface area contributing further to its increased aggregation moreover the high nonbonding cmc concentration could cause a bridging effect between particles during the particle production process as was illustrated by cirtiu et al 2011 for nzvi b cmc paa nzvi was the fastest to settle and quickest to aggregate at a constant rate table s2 fig 2d laumann et al 2013 observed extensive aggregation of this type of nip with a mean particle size of 1600 1400 nm when in solution we could observe these particles forming large aggregates up to few hundred microns and settling rapidly therefore only one experiment was performed with this nip type similarly to the nzvi b particles paa nzvi exhibits magnetic forces between particles and has a very small primary particle diameter 50 nm however the very low stabilizer concentration is not sufficient to entrap particles and prevent further aggregation from occurring moreover paa was reported to have a less effective stabilizing effect than cmc due to the lower negative charge induced by it cirtiu et al 2011 raychoudhury et al 2010 which ultimately resulted in low particle stability 3 2 transport experiments 3 2 1 nip arrival time and decay btcs of nip transport experiments together with average uranine and average br btcs are presented in fig 4 when comparing uranine and br breakthrough it can be observed that uranine has an earlier breakthrough than br fig 3 table s2 br molecules have a smaller size and hence higher diffusion coefficient witthûser et al 2000 resulting in br increased diffusivity into the matrix all nip arrived at the outlet earlier than br this phenomenon has been reported for clay colloids viruses and latex microspheres e g albarran et al 2013 cumbie and mckay 1999 weisbrod et al 2013 zvikelsky and weisbrod 2006 it is the result of size exclusion from small aperture zones and matrix and transport mainly in the center of streamlines taylor dispersion leading to faster transport of colloids than of solutes in fractures the first arrival time of all cmc stabilized nip was later than that of uranine and go ha injected without cmc late arrival was also observed for br injected with the cmc stabilized solution compared to br injected with non cmc stabilized solutions fig 4 table s2 this is because of the cmc stabilized solution s higher viscosity imposed a higher shear force leading to slower transport velocity of particles and solutes several studies reported an ideal particle aggregate size for transport in fractures in the range of 200 500 nm cumbie and mckay 1999 tran et al 2015 zvikelsky and weisbrod 2006 the average size of go ha in marw 400 nm table s1 was within that size range which further explains its relatively fast transport and high recoveries table s2 all nip concentration decay was sharp and no tailing was observed indicating the lack of matrix diffusion this was expected as the nip aggregate size tested here few hundred to several thousands of nm table s3 was much greater than the average pore throat value of chalk 150 nm zvikelsky and weisbrod 2006 this in contrast to the tailing observed by the soluble tracers attributed to back diffusion from the matrix 3 2 2 the correlation of btcs and stability tests breakthrough of the different nip types correlated with stability test results where the more stable nip suspensions demonstrated greater recovery this was evident by comparing stability test results in i i0 values at 120 min when most particles have reached their final settling rate to transport experiment recovery values r2 0 91 for all experiments fig 3 table s2 when experiments of similar is are plotted the correlation between recovery and stability increases r2 0 95 for marw and r2 0 97 arwx10 fig 3 this suggests that stability tests are a good tool to use for particle mobility prediction the highest recoveries were observed for go cmc go ha and cic cmc in marw which presented average recoveries of 65 9 4 3 63 4 0 8 62 2 0 6 respectively table s2 these recovery values were in the range of those observed for the soluble tracers 76 9 6 9 for uranine 73 2 1 and 64 2 4 1 for br in the cmc stabilized and the non cmc stabilized solutions respectively however matrix diffusion is likely the reason for the soluble tracers retention whereas nip matrix diffusion is unlikely as explained above section 3 2 1 nzvi paa and nzvi b which demonstrated lower particle stability were also less mobile table s2 although the solutions were agitated in the influent reservoir nips migrating through the fracture can aggregate and settle during their transport the importance of particles stability for transport of nips was demonstrated by raychoudhury et al 2010 who reported that large aggregates formed at higher nip concentrations cause increased particle removal by straining phenrat et al 2010 showed how unstable particles can be deposited in the system clogging the pores and further decreasing nzvi mobility kocur et al 2013 though working with relatively stable 60 100 nm nzvi cmc particles stressed the importance of testing and quantifying particle settling rate for proper nzvi migration prediction and modeling clearly in the case of unstable particles like those in some of the nip suspensions studied here stability tests are of great importance for particle transport prediction 3 2 3 effect of ionic strength in fig 3 it can be observed that all higher is experiment recoveries are shifted downward when compared to the lower is experiments even for similar stability values thus increased is is shown to reduce recoveries even in cases when it does not impact particle stability higher is induces compaction of the double layer and screening of particles electrostatic repulsion thereby promoting nip carrier interactions petosa et al 2010 saleh and kim 2008 tosco et al 2012 hence it can be deduced that at higher is interception increases when the effect of is on the different nip is examined go ha particles experienced the greatest impact go ha breakthrough was dramatically reduced from an average recovery of 63 4 0 8 to 15 2 4 6 when the is was elevated this was mainly the result of aggregation from rh dls 200 nm to calculated rh stb 6500 nm and consequently enhanced deposition fig 2b and table s1 despite the minimal effect of is on stability and size of go cmc and cic cmc fig 2a c and table s1 a decrease in recovery was observed 65 9 4 3 to 51 2 and 62 2 0 6 to 59 4 3 3 respectively fig 4a c due to increased particle collector interactions as explained above the spikes in go ha arwx10 btcs during the onset of nip flushing are probably the result of the unstable particles temporal settling toward the outlet due to the 1 2 min pause in flow section 2 5 and later resuspension by initiation of flow 3 2 4 nips transport mechanism studies reported various governing transport mechanisms for nip in porous media he et al 2009 and tiraferri et al 2008 suggested diffusion dominant transport of small 15 nm and larger particles 300 nm respectively straining was shown by several studies to be significant mainly when aggregation occurred e g raychoudhury et al 2010 saleh et al 2007 other studies illustrated deposition as an important governing process e g laumann et al 2013 phenrat et al 2010 zhang et al 2015 the main mechanisms governing colloid transport in fractures can be straining diffusion settling and interception oswald and ibaraki 2001 weisbrod et al 2013 zhang et al 2012 zvikelsky and weisbrod 2006 straining in this study is unlikely to play a role due to low particle collector size ratio always 0 013 diffusion affects mostly the solutes and to a much lesser extent particles especially particles in the density 2 5 8 g cm3 and size range studied here from rh dls 200 nm to calculated rh stb 6500 nm under these conditions interception and sedimentation are much more likely to be the governing mechanisms however the large fracture aperture size studied here two orders of magnitude more than the nip diameter reduces the likelihood of nip interception by collector interaction therefore combined with the high correlation of nip transport to stability fig 3 it is reasonable to deduce that the main transport mechanism governing nip transport in this study is sedimentation other mechanism affecting particles to lesser extent were witnessed at increased is in stable particles where increased is had little effect on stability reduced recoveries were still witnessed section 3 2 3 this observation suggests that interception played a higher role in nip transport at increased is see above section 3 2 3 it should be noted that sorption batch tests of the different nip to chalk rock were performed and no sorption during the time scale of the experiment was observed nevertheless at longer time scales sorption was observed see supplementary information section s5 for details despite the large aggregates formed in some of the experiments see table s1 no change in the fracture aperture was observed following the transport experiments and no clogging effect was measured highlighting the potential superior and continuous mobility of nip in fractures it should be noted that while high recoveries of nip in pure pre treated porous media were reported mackenzie et al 2012 he et al 2009 raychoudhury et al 2010 kocur et al 2013 tosco et al 2012 recoveries were markedly lower when natural porous media was tested laumann et al 2013 he et al 2009 zhang et al 2015 in fractured media on the other hand the occurrence of large conduits and in many cases high flow rates zhang et al 2012 may lead to high breakthrough of the stable nip suspensions section 3 2 2 4 conclusions this study deals with nip transport in natural carbonate fractured media in low and higher is to the best of our knowledge the literature has scarce experimental work in this environment we demonstrate how various nips will migrate in fractures under different is the most dominant factor controlling nip mobility was found to be particle stability nip stability controls their travel distance and recovery rates in fact stability tests proved to be a reliable predictor for particle mobility in fractures the nip stabilizer type and concentration were shown to greatly impact the nip stability and hence mobility this was especially prominent at increased is where the mobility is expected to be much lower cmc was demonstrated as a very efficient stabilizer and increasing its concentration lead to greater nip stability also nips that lack or could mask magnetic interactions were shown to be much more mobile go and cic it is evident that stable nips could potentially travel through fractures further than reported for porous media and avoid substantial clogging and attenuation caused by diffusion straining and interception manipulating nip stability by changing stabilizer type and or concentration along with the additional tests of aquifer groundwater flow parameters could yield very diverse transport behavior distance traveled sedimentation along the route and distribution the option of manipulating nip transport is advantageous for efficient application in fractured bedrock considering 25 of groundwater withdrawal worldwide is from fractured aquifers the increased use of hydro fracking fractured systems typical complexity and heterogeneity and the massive contamination of fractured rocks mackay and cherry 1989

19852,anaerobic digestion of biowaste not only reduces environmental burden but also plays an important role for sustainable energy supply for process optimization simulation based on the anaerobic digestion model no 1 adm1 is commonly used the adm1 was extended to include the known three genera of propionate oxidizing bacteria pob and the two routes of propionate degradation methyl malonyl coa and c6 dismutation pathway kinetic parameters for anaerobic propionate oxidation by single strains of the three propionate oxidizing genera were determined from defined tri cultures of the pob with hydrogenotrophic and acetotrophic methanogens and implemented into adm1 the such improved model adm1xpro was evaluated with operational data from a full scale wet biowaste digestion plant predicted amounts of biogas and composition with adm1xpro 2201 m³ d 1 68 1 ch4 and 31 9 co2 correlated well with full scale process data 2171 m³ d 1 67 5 ch4 and 31 9 co2 graphical abstract image 1 keywords biogas technology wet digestion of biowaste mathematical modeling adm1 and adm1xpro propionate oxidizing bacteria 1 introduction 1 anaerobic digestion is increasingly getting popular since it not only reduces environmental burden but also offers the advantage of utilizing organic wastes to produce biogas a renewable source of energy according to the european biogas association 17 376 biogas plants and 459 biomethane plants are in operation in europe germany is the leading nation with 10 846 biogas plants and 185 biomethane plants eba european biogas association 2017 source separated domestic biowaste is digested in 75 biowaste digestion plants in germany with a total capacity of 1 9 mio t per year kern and raussen 2014 re use of digestate as a fertilizer and energy recovery from methane contribute to climate protection and resource conservation in order to boost the biogas technology modeling of the complex process of anaerobic digestion has proven to be a useful tool for process design determination of optimal operating conditions and control of process parameters modeling of biogas reactors was shown to be reliable in predicting the system s performance and can improve the understanding of the complex microbiological processes involved in methanogenesis of liquid and solid organic substrates 1 all symbols and indices are used according to the standardized basis of the anaerobic digestion model no 1 adm1 batstone et al 2002 and are listed in table 1 1 1 anaerobic digestion model no 1 and model updates the anaerobic digestion model no 1 adm1 is a widely applicable mathematical model which was developed by a task group of the iwa for describing the anaerobic digestion process batstone et al 2002 adm1 is based inter alia on a previous model developed by siegrist siegrist et al 1993 that was later on updated e g siegrist et al 2002 it includes the major processes such as disintegration hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis involved in the bioconversion of complex organic substrates into methane carbon dioxide and inert residues along with metabolic intermediates like acetic acid propionic acid and n butyric acid furthermore physicochemical processes such as gas liquid equilibria for methane carbon dioxide and especially hydrogen are included the strength of this model is in its consideration of separate biomass fractions and their decay apart from incorporating four main stages of anaerobic degradation and dividing them into 31 processes and 33 fractions moreover the model includes a composite fraction xc which represents any type of a complex substrate xc is separated into carbohydrates xch proteins xpr lipids xli and inert material xi fractions during the disintegration step batstone et al 2002 ifak 2005 it is assumed that hydrolysis of proteins carbohydrates and fats are the rate limiting steps of the anaerobic degradation this applies in particular to the fermentation of high molecular structural materials such as grass cuttings or kitchen waste for modeling of disintegration and hydrolysis first order kinetics are used acidification of carbohydrates and proteins and the anaerobic oxidation of fatty acids are modeled using monod kinetics besides acetogenesis the mathematical description of acetotrophic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis is one focal point of the adm1 for acetogenesis mainly two groups of obligately syntrophic bacteria are required that degrade n butyrate to acetate and propionate to acetate and carbon dioxide both with formation of hydrogen methane formation from hydrogen and co2 and acetotrophic methanogenesis may be the next rate limiting steps after hydrolysis and fermentation causing volatile fatty acid accumulation and a drop of the ph the ph and gas exchange equilibria between liquid phase and gas phase on the basis of henry s and dalton s law are considered in the model the ph value in anaerobic digesters is a result of buffer capacity of mainly nh3 nh4 and hco3 co2 and of the degree of dissociation of organic acids thus being dependent on substrate composition and the loading rate except for the capability of the adm1 to describe biogas production and composition adm1 was commonly used as an anaerobic degradation model for different complex substrates like grass silage wichern et al 2009 agricultural substrates lübken et al 2010 cattle manure schoen et al 2009 grass maize green weed silage and industrial glycerine biernacki et al 2013 or lipid rich wastes beline et al 2017 in 2006 the adm1 was further updated by wett et al 2006 who added a new fraction of inert decay products xp the formation of xp is described by a biomass decay factor fp accordingly the name of the model was changed to adm1xp by ifak institut für automation und kommunikation magdeburg already in 2003 fedorovich et al 2003 published an extension of adm1 with hydrogen sulfide production and oxidation of n butyrate propionate acetate and hydrogen by sulfate reducing bacteria srb xu et al 2011 reduced the adm1 to a generalized model of a two tiered microbial food chain to analyze its stability and nonlinear dynamics their model only consists of two biomass fractions propionate degraders and hydrogen utilizers and two substrate fractions propionate and hydrogen and takes into account inhibition by hydrogen the production of acetate and inhibition by high concentrations of acetate are ignored to keep the model simple analytical investigation of the systems stability showed that maintenance decay seems to be the decisive factor without taking maintenance into account the model was always stable with inclusion of maintenance it was not necessarily stable however using the default parameters of adm1 the model was always stable bergland et al 2015 examined the impact of temperature on modeling of the anaerobic digestion process they obtained the best fit of both biogas production and intermediate products by implementing individual temperature effects for each biochemical reaction 1 2 anaerobic degradation of propionate concentrations of volatile fatty acids are the most important parameters in anaerobic digestion of organic matter in biogas plants in that sense the accumulation of acetic acid propionic acid and n butyric acid is an indicator for disturbances of the degradation process propionate is a key intermediate of anaerobic digestion in general and of biowaste in particular mcmahon et al 2004 gallert and winter 2008 li et al 2012 moertelmaier et al 2014 main sources of propionate in bioreactors are odd numbered fatty acids from lipolysis of fat and oil as well as from degradation of carbohydrates and amino acids propionate accumulates during disturbances of the anaerobic digestion process caused by e g high organic loading rates close to overload high dry matter content slowing down mass balance equilibria or toxic substances that disturb a balanced sequence of physiological reactions leading to biogas formation from complex organic matter gallert and winter 2008 moertelmaier et al 2014 li et al 2014 biogas production can become severely destabilized by propionate accumulation wang et al 2006 therefore propionate degradation during anaerobic digestion is of specific interest due to its thermodynamically unfavorable change of the gibbs free energy δg 0 propionate degradation is achieved by propionate oxidizing bacteria pob and hydrogen consuming microorganisms e g methanogenic archaea or sulfate reducers in biogas reactors syntrophy thermodynamic principles of anaerobic degradation of propionate with carbon dioxide as single external electron acceptor require a low partial pressure of hydrogen in the range of 10 pa scholten and conrad 2000 felchner zwirello et al 2013 therefore degradation of propionate needs syntrophic interaction of pob and hydrogen utilizers because propionate oxidation and consumption of hydrogen are affected by different genera of microorganisms alternatively sulfate or other reducible co substrates could be used as hydrogen acceptors by some pob that are not obligate syntrophs the genera syntrophobacter and smithella pob belonging to deltaproteobacteria as well as the genera pelotomaculum and desulfotomaculum belonging to firmicutes are known anaerobic pob li et al 2012 pob can be distinguished by their metabolic pathway the randomized methyl malonyl coa pathway equ 1 catalyzed by species of the genera desulfotomaculum pelotomaculum and syntrophobacter and the c 6 dismutation pathway equ 2a 2b catalyzed only by smithella propionica which yield respectively acetic acid hydrogen and carbon dioxide equ 1 or acetic acid and hydrogen equ 2b with butyric acid equ 2a as an intermediate de bok et al 2001 liu et

biokinetic data of propionate oxidizing bacteria pob pob and hydrogen as well as acetate utilizing methanogenic archaea were obtained from leibnitz institute german collection of microorganisms and cell cultures dsmz the pob syntrophobacter sulfatireducens dsm 16706 pelotomaculum propionicicum dsm 15578 smithella propionica dsm 16934 the hydrogenotrophic methanogenic archaea methanospirillum hungatei dsm 864 and the acetotrophic methanogenic archaea methanosaeta concilli dsm 2139 were cultivated in liquid media as recommended by dsmz defined tri cultures of hydrogenotrophic and acetotrophic methanogens were prepared and fed with different concentrations of propionate propionate degradation by the tri cultures was analyzed by gas chromatography scion 456 gc bruker ma usa using n2 as carrier gas a stabilwax restek pa usa column as stationary phase for volatile fatty acid separation and a flame ionization detector for detection michaelis menten kinetic data were calculated from the slope of propionate degradation curves biomass yield factors were calculated by measuring the protein concentration of the tri cultures according to bradford 1976 and dividing the results by the proportions of the respective pob as determined by fluorescence microscopy specific oligonucleotide probes were used for enumeration of the pob in the tri cultures by fluorescence in situ hybridization fish details of fixation staining enumeration and calculation are described by li et al 2014 2 3 modeling and simulation anaerobic degradation of biowaste in the wet digestion plant karlsruhe durlach was modeled and simulated with the software package simba 6 6 ifak system gmbh germany in the 32 bit environment matlab simulink mathwork usa using specific plant data capacity and dimensions of the biowaste plant composition of the biowaste suspension feeding amount and mode of the substrate etc the simulation system simba allows the holistic consideration of wastewater treatment and sludge treatment biogas production the setting up of simulation models is based on graphical linkage of model blocks which represent unit processes e g activated sludge tanks digesters 3 results and discussion at first the measured values listed in table 2 representing the substrate composition of the biowaste suspension were transferred to a new converter file and to the model block biogas tractor required input data total solids volatile solids total kjeldahl nitrogen and ammonia fig 1 a and the simulation was carried out with the unmodified model adm1xp in simba 6 6 for a period of 730 d the results of simulation revealed the expected significant differences of measured values with those obtained by the model biogas composition with roughly same concentrations of co2 and h2 and almost no production of ch4 ph was comparatively low 4 1 and the concentrations of the biomass fractions xfa xc4 xpro xac and xh2 tended to be zero only xsu and xaa are maintained in the system therefore a sensitivity analysis and fitting of relevant model parameters was performed in a first optimization approach 3 1 sensitivity analysis trial and error approach in a first optimization approach the parameter ki nh3 inhibition term of ammonia was increased from 0 0018 to 0 008 in accordance with the work of wichern et al 2009 this modification caused a drastic change in the results the biogas production increased and the biogas consisted of 54 5 ch4 and 45 5 co2 whereas the concentration of h2 tended towards zero the concentrations of all 7 biomass fractions were significantly above 0 the ph value was consistently at 6 92 the next step was to vary the default values for the fractionation percentage of carbohydrates proteins lipids and inert material in the substrate xc of the substrate in the converter file the selected values of the two dimensionless parameters ixch xch part of ots fraction of carbohydrates in substrate xc and ixpr xpr part of ots fraction of proteins in substrate xc are shown in table 3 the used biowaste suspension consisted on average of 50 carbohydrates and 22 proteins gallert et al 2002 and 5 different changes of this relation were used after that the fractionation in the model approach initial value for composition of the reactor contents was also adapted in the same way in both cases there were no significant changes concerning the amount and composition of biogas subsequently other influencing factors for the composition of the substrate fractions c xch c xpr c xli c content of carbohydrates proteins and lipids and hydrolysis of these fractions khyd ch khyd pr khyd li as listed in table 4 were analyzed the results showed that biogas composition can significantly be influenced by the parameter c xch a decrease leads to higher methane levels however in all cases simulation revealed an excessively high biogas production two to three times higher as compared with the measured data for further consideration a gain block theoretical option possibility for changing the amount of the feed was inserted into the feed stream inflow of the biowaste digester with a factor of 0 5 in the gain block the biogas production was within the range of the measurements the biogas composition showed only minimal changes 54 2 methane and 45 8 carbon dioxide in addition to the reduced feed stream the parameter c xch was adjusted from 0 0313 to 0 020 this adjustment led to a good accordance with the measured values concerning amount and composition of biogas however this is only a formal and arbitrary modification trial and error approach without a reasonable scientific explanation therefore a scientific approach through improving the model by the implementation of the different genera of pob and the related biological processes appeared appropriate and more constructive 3 2 adaptation of the model adm1xp by implementation of the different fractions of pob and creation of the improved model adm1xpro in order to get a better fit between real and simulated values a modification of the model approach by a more detailed description of the degradation of propionic acid seemed to be a much better way to simulate anaerobic digestion of biowaste or other substrates rich in proteins or odd numbered fatty acids accordingly the original model approach was modified to adm1xpro by replacing the existing single model fraction for the pob by the three genera of mesophilic syntrophic pob adding the two different degradation pathways and expanding the model matrix with the additional fractions kinetic expressions and model parameters e g growth decay rates yield factors g protein per mol propionate oxidized km mmol propionate per liter and vmax values mmol propionate per liter and hour were determined in defined tri cultures consisting of pob and hydrogen and acetate utilizing methanospirillum hungatei and methanosaeta concilii respectively propionate oxidation rates depending on initial propionate concentrations in the rage of 0 5 12 5 mmol l 1 were determined fig 2 a and km and vmax values were deducted from lineweaver burk diagrams as shown in fig 2b exemplarily for the tri culture of pelotomaculum propionicicum m hungatei and m concilii all km and vmax values of the tri cultures of the pob syntrophobacter sulfatireducens pelotomaculum propionicicum and smithella propionica with the two methanogens are summarized in table 5 the propionate oxidation rate of e g a tri culture of s sulfatireducens m hungatei and m concilii of 0 09 mmol l 1 h 1 table 5 was almost double as high than the reported 0 05 mmol l 1 h 1 for a defined co culture of syntrophobacter fumaroxidans with m hungatei scholten and conrad 2000 in co cultures of pob with hydrogenotrophic methanogens acetate is however an intermediate and is accumulating it was shown by a respective ki that propionate oxidation in the presence of only 20 mmol l 1 acetate was inhibited by 50 felchner zwirello 2014 a yield of 0 84 g protein per mole propionate table 5 in a defined tri culture of s sulfatireducens m hungatei and m concilii represents 1 68 g cell dry weight per mole of propionate if protein contributes 50 to the dry weight this cell yield was significantly higher than the yield of 1 02 g dry weight per mole propionate determined by scholten and conrad 2000 for a co culture of s fumaroxidans and m hungatei inhibition of propionate oxidation by accumulating acetate may have affected growth of pob in the two membered co culture adm1 and adm1xp are based on a conservation law for cod and therefore the base unit for all carbon compounds is cod m ³ in order to convert biokinetic data of defined tri cultures of propionate oxidizing syntrophobacter pelotomaculum and smithella species with hydrogenothrophic and acetotrophic methanogens into corresponding units used in adm1 as done in table 5 the following assumptions and conversions were required the determined protein amount was converted into biomass using the sum formula c4h7 2o2n0 8 mw 98 4 g mol 1 according to scholten and conrad 2000 protein concentrations divided by a factor of 6 25 reveal the nitrogen content of the protein and with the sum formula the total biomass 11 38 of c4h7 2o2n0 8 corresponds to n could be calculated the cod of 1 g biomass with an average composition of c4h7 2o2n0 8 is 1 366 g cod and that of 1 g propionate is 1 513 g cod michaelis menten parameters like km and vmax values could be set equal to the monod half saturation coefficient ks and μmax as used in adm1 if growth was not uncoupled from substrate utilization the biokinetic constants for tri cultures of the three genera of pob with hydrogenotrophic and acetotrophic methanogens were converted into converted biokinetic values and differ from the default values used in adm1 table 5 the real yield values are lower factor 4 than the default values and the half saturation coefficients are much higher than the default values merely the maximum uptake rates are in the same order or twice as high as seen in table 5 the biokinetic values and in consequence also the converted biokinetic values conversion from biokinetic values e g mmol prop l 1 into typical values used in the adm1 e g kg cod prop m 3 deviate between the different genera of pob in order to improve the adm1 further the proportion of pob in the respective environment could be useful information in the full scale biowaste wet digester most of the pob 89 belonged to the genus pelotomaculum only about 10 of the pob were species of syntrophobacter and only about 1 of the pob were species of smithella li et al 2015 in order to improve the description of the biological processes related to propionate oxidation the above mentioned proportions of pob were transferred into the adm1xp initially the already existing fraction xpro and the related parameters were tripled according to three described pob and the corresponding processes in the petersen matrix for all three fractions xpro 1 xpro 2 xpro 3 were described in the same way in the next step the values of the biological parameters yield coefficient half saturation coefficient maximum uptake rate for the three new biomass fractions xpro 1 syntrophobacter xpro 2 pelotomaculum xpro 3 smithella were changed according to the observed real proportions of pob during biowaste wet digestion li et al 2015 and converted into dimensions used in adm1 table 5 proportion related biokinetic values as a further step the mathematical description of the biological processes which are linked with the degradation of propionic acid was modified in the model in accordance with the different routes of degradation methyl malonyl coa and c6 dismutation pathway as described in chapter 1 2 the structure of the modified model adm1xpro is shown in fig 3 and the petersen matrix of adm1xpro with the adapted processes is illustrated in table 6 note only the new additional processes the three new pob fractions and other influenced fractions are presented the unchanged processes and fractions are not shown in order to preserve clarity these parts of the petersen matrix can be obtained from batstone et al 2002 the factors fbu pro fh2 pro and fac pro indicate the percentage in relation to the basic unit cod of the three products butyrate hydrogen and acetate which are formed from the source material propionate these three factors have to sum up to 1 this means that the following equation can also be used fbu pro 1 fh2 pro fac pro with the such modified model excellent results were achieved concerning the amount and composition of biogas while maintaining the default value for the parameter c xch 0 0313 this means that arbitrarily changing parameters as described exemplarily in chapter 3 1 were avoided if the exact composition of the pob biomass xpro 1 xpro 2 and xpro 3 is not known an appropriate way would be to set all three fractions equal 33 3 and using the values listed in table 5 adapted biokinetic values rather than to use the default values however if the initial concentrations of all three pob fractions are zeroed large differences are arising only about half of the biogas amount 1170 m³ d 1 is produced and the gas composition changed fundamentally 8 4 ch4 45 2 co2 46 4 h2 3 3 simulation of the wet digestion biowaste plant karlsruhe durlach subsequently the simulation was carried out using the average values for the amount and dosage of substrate for the period from january december 2013 3 3 1 long term analysis period based on the data given in section 2 1 a simulation model of the biowaste digestion plant karlsruhe durlach was created in the simulation software simba 6 6 the system data for the year 2013 show that on average 7 8 pulper each containing 20 m³ substrate were added per day addition of defibered biowaste suspension was carried out from 7 00 a m to 19 00 p m over 12 h same time intervals for addition of pulper loads were assumed resulting in time steps of 1 71 h and the following dosage times 7 00 h 8 71 h 10 43 h 12 14 h 13 86 h 15 57 h 17 29 h 19 00 h eight model blocks biogas tractor were used to integrate the substrate feed into the simulation model of the biogas plant fig 1a shows the system diagram of the plant in simba 6 6 with fixed feeding times as expected after a short adaptation phase the simulation with the adm1xpro over a period of 730 days showed a constant biogas production fig 4 a black line resulting in 3676 m3 maximum biogas yield per day due to the feeding mode of the plant 5 days a week fed batch feeding from 7 00 a m to 7 00 p m slightly different amounts of substrate per pulper the measured biogas amounts showed typically saw tooth shape this saw tooth shape no feeding on saturdays and sundays could be adapted by reducing the calculated results by a corresponding portion of feed leading to an average biogas yield of 2626 m3 per day grey line in fig 4a the biogas production curve for the biowaste digestion plant of karlsruhe durlach shows two periods with very little or no biogas production the first in february 2013 as a result of machine failure and the second during june 2013 when the digester was emptied and completely revised li et al 2014 to take these periods of 59 d into account the simulation for 12 months regular feeding and maximal biogas production black line in fig 4a was repeated for 10 months regular feeding and 59 d revision the calculated average amount of 2201 m³ biogas d 1 containing 68 1 ch4 and 31 9 co2 fig 5 bar adm1xpro was well within the range of the recorded values mean value for biogas production 2171 m³ d 1 containing 67 5 methane and 32 5 co2 see fig 5 bar measurement for comparison the bar adm1xp in the middle of fig 5 shows the simulated biogas composition for the original adm1xp with only one single modification ki nh3 was increased from 0 0018 to 0 008 as described in chapter 3 1 and similar for adm1xpro the improved model adm1xpro could better display or reproduce the real biogas composition containing 67 5 ch4 and 32 5 co2 of a full scale biowaste wet digestion plant with 68 1 ch4 and 31 9 co2 compared to 54 1 ch4 and 45 9 co2 when using adm1xp fig 5 this is important when calculating the profit from selling electricity after conversion of biogas in a chp of actual 14 88 cent per kwh and 500 kw performance of the chp eeg 2017 3 3 2 short term analysis period in order to check whether the model can also reflect daily fluctuations of biogas production fed batch mode of feeding another simulation set up was prepared in this case the input data were imported from an excel file containing the measured values during august 2013 for the time of feeding with a high time resolution in the first step with an interval of 5 min in the second step with an interval of 1 min the values for the input parameters of the substrate content of dry mass organic dry mass nitrogen and ammonia were kept constant because analytical data for the daily substrate composition were not available and working procedures were not changing fig 1b shows the system diagram of the plant in simba 6 6 with the imported real curve of substrate feeding in this case the simulation with the adm1xpro showed a similar trend of biogas production as measured in reality fig 4b lines measured values and simulation with adm1xpro but slight differences concerning curve progression peak shape can still be seen the remaining differences between measured data and simulation are presumably caused by variations of the biowaste composition in a large scale biogas plant it is not possible to analyze the composition content of dry mass organic dry mass cod nitrogen ammonia etc of each substrate batch every day or during different seasons for this reason a slight deviation of process data and simulations seems to be unavoidable for prediction and calculation of main parameters such as biogas amount and biogas composition by changes of the substrate the presented simulations could help to maintain a stable anaerobic digestion process to configurate an appropriate chp and to estimate the electricity and heat amount 4 conclusions the adm1 is a very sophisticated model for anaerobic digestion with many parameters and variation options in principle it would be possible to achieve a satisfying correlation between measurement and simulation by purely mathematical methods optimization algorithms the meaningfulness of such an approach is however doubtful because this is not based on process knowledge and applicability to other data sets is not given this study demonstrated that a reasonable extension of the model by differentiation of general degradation processes into single more detailed processes e g pob and propionate degradation pathways can result in a better match between simulation by using adm1xpro and measurement and thus allows better process

19852,anaerobic digestion of biowaste not only reduces environmental burden but also plays an important role for sustainable energy supply for process optimization simulation based on the anaerobic digestion model no 1 adm1 is commonly used the adm1 was extended to include the known three genera of propionate oxidizing bacteria pob and the two routes of propionate degradation methyl malonyl coa and c6 dismutation pathway kinetic parameters for anaerobic propionate oxidation by single strains of the three propionate oxidizing genera were determined from defined tri cultures of the pob with hydrogenotrophic and acetotrophic methanogens and implemented into adm1 the such improved model adm1xpro was evaluated with operational data from a full scale wet biowaste digestion plant predicted amounts of biogas and composition with adm1xpro 2201 m³ d 1 68 1 ch4 and 31 9 co2 correlated well with full scale process data 2171 m³ d 1 67 5 ch4 and 31 9 co2 graphical abstract image 1 keywords biogas technology wet digestion of biowaste mathematical modeling adm1 and adm1xpro propionate oxidizing bacteria 1 introduction 1 anaerobic digestion is increasingly getting popular since it not only reduces environmental burden but also offers the advantage of utilizing organic wastes to produce biogas a renewable source of energy according to the european biogas association 17 376 biogas plants and 459 biomethane plants are in operation in europe germany is the leading nation with 10 846 biogas plants and 185 biomethane plants eba european biogas association 2017 source separated domestic biowaste is digested in 75 biowaste digestion plants in germany with a total capacity of 1 9 mio t per year kern and raussen 2014 re use of digestate as a fertilizer and energy recovery from methane contribute to climate protection and resource conservation in order to boost the biogas technology modeling of the complex process of anaerobic digestion has proven to be a useful tool for process design determination of optimal operating conditions and control of process parameters modeling of biogas reactors was shown to be reliable in predicting the system s performance and can improve the understanding of the complex microbiological processes involved in methanogenesis of liquid and solid organic substrates 1 all symbols and indices are used according to the standardized basis of the anaerobic digestion model no 1 adm1 batstone et al 2002 and are listed in table 1 1 1 anaerobic digestion model no 1 and model updates the anaerobic digestion model no 1 adm1 is a widely applicable mathematical model which was developed by a task group of the iwa for describing the anaerobic digestion process batstone et al 2002 adm1 is based inter alia on a previous model developed by siegrist siegrist et al 1993 that was later on updated e g siegrist et al 2002 it includes the major processes such as disintegration hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis involved in the bioconversion of complex organic substrates into methane carbon dioxide and inert residues along with metabolic intermediates like acetic acid propionic acid and n butyric acid furthermore physicochemical processes such as gas liquid equilibria for methane carbon dioxide and especially hydrogen are included the strength of this model is in its consideration of separate biomass fractions and their decay apart from incorporating four main stages of anaerobic degradation and dividing them into 31 processes and 33 fractions moreover the model includes a composite fraction xc which represents any type of a complex substrate xc is separated into carbohydrates xch proteins xpr lipids xli and inert material xi fractions during the disintegration step batstone et al 2002 ifak 2005 it is assumed that hydrolysis of proteins carbohydrates and fats are the rate limiting steps of the anaerobic degradation this applies in particular to the fermentation of high molecular structural materials such as grass cuttings or kitchen waste for modeling of disintegration and hydrolysis first order kinetics are used acidification of carbohydrates and proteins and the anaerobic oxidation of fatty acids are modeled using monod kinetics besides acetogenesis the mathematical description of acetotrophic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis is one focal point of the adm1 for acetogenesis mainly two groups of obligately syntrophic bacteria are required that degrade n butyrate to acetate and propionate to acetate and carbon dioxide both with formation of hydrogen methane formation from hydrogen and co2 and acetotrophic methanogenesis may be the next rate limiting steps after hydrolysis and fermentation causing volatile fatty acid accumulation and a drop of the ph the ph and gas exchange equilibria between liquid phase and gas phase on the basis of henry s and dalton s law are considered in the model the ph value in anaerobic digesters is a result of buffer capacity of mainly nh3 nh4 and hco3 co2 and of the degree of dissociation of organic acids thus being dependent on substrate composition and the loading rate except for the capability of the adm1 to describe biogas production and composition adm1 was commonly used as an anaerobic degradation model for different complex substrates like grass silage wichern et al 2009 agricultural substrates lübken et al 2010 cattle manure schoen et al 2009 grass maize green weed silage and industrial glycerine biernacki et al 2013 or lipid rich wastes beline et al 2017 in 2006 the adm1 was further updated by wett et al 2006 who added a new fraction of inert decay products xp the formation of xp is described by a biomass decay factor fp accordingly the name of the model was changed to adm1xp by ifak institut für automation und kommunikation magdeburg already in 2003 fedorovich et al 2003 published an extension of adm1 with hydrogen sulfide production and oxidation of n butyrate propionate acetate and hydrogen by sulfate reducing bacteria srb xu et al 2011 reduced the adm1 to a generalized model of a two tiered microbial food chain to analyze its stability and nonlinear dynamics their model only consists of two biomass fractions propionate degraders and hydrogen utilizers and two substrate fractions propionate and hydrogen and takes into account inhibition by hydrogen the production of acetate and inhibition by high concentrations of acetate are ignored to keep the model simple analytical investigation of the systems stability showed that maintenance decay seems to be the decisive factor without taking maintenance into account the model was always stable with inclusion of maintenance it was not necessarily stable however using the default parameters of adm1 the model was always stable bergland et al 2015 examined the impact of temperature on modeling of the anaerobic digestion process they obtained the best fit of both biogas production and intermediate products by implementing individual temperature effects for each biochemical reaction 1 2 anaerobic degradation of propionate concentrations of volatile fatty acids are the most important parameters in anaerobic digestion of organic matter in biogas plants in that sense the accumulation of acetic acid propionic acid and n butyric acid is an indicator for disturbances of the degradation process propionate is a key intermediate of anaerobic digestion in general and of biowaste in particular mcmahon et al 2004 gallert and winter 2008 li et al 2012 moertelmaier et al 2014 main sources of propionate in bioreactors are odd numbered fatty acids from lipolysis of fat and oil as well as from degradation of carbohydrates and amino acids propionate accumulates during disturbances of the anaerobic digestion process caused by e g high organic loading rates close to overload high dry matter content slowing down mass balance equilibria or toxic substances that disturb a balanced sequence of physiological reactions leading to biogas formation from complex organic matter gallert and winter 2008 moertelmaier et al 2014 li et al 2014 biogas production can become severely destabilized by propionate accumulation wang et al 2006 therefore propionate degradation during anaerobic digestion is of specific interest due to its thermodynamically unfavorable change of the gibbs free energy δg 0 propionate degradation is achieved by propionate oxidizing bacteria pob and hydrogen consuming microorganisms e g methanogenic archaea or sulfate reducers in biogas reactors syntrophy thermodynamic principles of anaerobic degradation of propionate with carbon dioxide as single external electron acceptor require a low partial pressure of hydrogen in the range of 10 pa scholten and conrad 2000 felchner zwirello et al 2013 therefore degradation of propionate needs syntrophic interaction of pob and hydrogen utilizers because propionate oxidation and consumption of hydrogen are affected by different genera of microorganisms alternatively sulfate or other reducible co substrates could be used as hydrogen acceptors by some pob that are not obligate syntrophs the genera syntrophobacter and smithella pob belonging to deltaproteobacteria as well as the genera pelotomaculum and desulfotomaculum belonging to firmicutes are known anaerobic pob li et al 2012 pob can be distinguished by their metabolic pathway the randomized methyl malonyl coa pathway equ 1 catalyzed by species of the genera desulfotomaculum pelotomaculum and syntrophobacter and the c 6 dismutation pathway equ 2a 2b catalyzed only by smithella propionica which yield respectively acetic acid hydrogen and carbon dioxide equ 1 or acetic acid and hydrogen equ 2b with butyric acid equ 2a as an intermediate de bok et al 2001 liu et

catalyzed by the above mentioned different genera of pob and propionate oxidation pathways were implemented 2 materials and methods 2 1 wet digestion biowaste plant karlsruhe durlach the separately

consideration a gain block theoretical option possibility for changing the amount of the feed was inserted into the feed stream inflow of the biowaste digester with a factor of 0 5 in the gain block the biogas production was within the range of the measurements the biogas composition showed only minimal changes 54 2 methane and 45 8 carbon dioxide in addition to the reduced feed stream the parameter c xch was adjusted from 0 0313 to 0 020 this adjustment led to a good accordance with the measured values concerning amount and composition of biogas however this is only a formal and arbitrary modification trial and error approach without a reasonable scientific explanation therefore a scientific approach through improving the model by the implementation of the different genera of pob and the related biological processes appeared appropriate and more constructive 3 2 adaptation of the model adm1xp by implementation of the different fractions of pob and creation of the improved model adm1xpro in order to get a better fit between real and simulated values a modification of the model approach by a more detailed description of the degradation of propionic acid seemed to be a much better way to simulate anaerobic digestion of biowaste or other substrates rich in proteins or odd numbered fatty acids accordingly the original model approach was modified to adm1xpro by replacing the existing single model fraction for the pob by the three genera of mesophilic syntrophic pob adding the two different degradation pathways and expanding the model matrix with the additional fractions kinetic expressions and model parameters e g growth decay rates yield factors g protein per mol propionate oxidized km mmol propionate per liter and vmax values mmol propionate per liter and hour were determined in defined tri cultures consisting of pob and hydrogen and acetate utilizing methanospirillum hungatei and methanosaeta concilii respectively propionate oxidation rates depending on initial propionate concentrations in the rage of 0 5 12 5 mmol l 1 were determined fig 2 a and km and vmax values were deducted from lineweaver burk diagrams as shown in fig 2b exemplarily for the tri culture of pelotomaculum propionicicum m hungatei and m concilii all km and vmax values of the tri cultures of the pob syntrophobacter sulfatireducens pelotomaculum propionicicum and smithella propionica with the two methanogens are summarized in table 5 the propionate oxidation rate of e g a tri culture of s sulfatireducens m hungatei and m concilii of 0 09 mmol l 1 h 1 table 5 was almost double as high than the reported 0 05 mmol l 1 h 1 for a defined co culture of syntrophobacter fumaroxidans with m hungatei scholten and conrad 2000 in co cultures of pob with hydrogenotrophic methanogens acetate is however an intermediate and is accumulating it was shown by a respective ki that propionate oxidation in the presence of only 20 mmol l 1 acetate was inhibited by 50 felchner zwirello 2014 a yield of 0 84 g protein per mole propionate table 5 in a defined tri culture of s sulfatireducens m hungatei and m concilii represents 1 68 g cell dry weight per mole of propionate if protein contributes 50 to the dry weight this cell yield was significantly higher than the yield of 1 02 g dry weight per mole propionate determined by scholten and conrad 2000 for a co culture of s fumaroxidans and m hungatei inhibition of propionate oxidation by accumulating acetate may have affected growth of pob in the two membered co culture adm1 and adm1xp are based on a conservation law for cod and therefore the base unit for all carbon compounds is cod m ³ in order to convert biokinetic data of defined tri cultures of propionate oxidizing syntrophobacter pelotomaculum and smithella species with hydrogenothrophic and acetotrophic methanogens into corresponding units used in adm1 as done in table 5 the following assumptions and conversions were required the determined protein amount was converted into biomass using the sum formula c4h7 2o2n0 8 mw 98 4 g mol 1 according to scholten and conrad 2000 protein concentrations divided by a factor of 6 25 reveal the nitrogen content of the protein and with the sum formula the total biomass 11 38 of c4h7 2o2n0 8 corresponds to n could be calculated the cod of 1 g biomass with an average composition of c4h7 2o2n0 8 is 1 366 g cod and that of 1 g propionate is 1 513 g cod michaelis menten parameters like km and vmax values could be set equal to the monod half saturation coefficient ks and μmax as used in adm1 if growth was not uncoupled from substrate utilization the biokinetic constants for tri cultures of the three genera of pob with hydrogenotrophic and acetotrophic methanogens were converted into converted biokinetic values and differ from the default values used in adm1 table 5 the real yield values are lower factor 4 than the default values and the half saturation coefficients are much higher than the default values merely the maximum uptake rates are in the same order or twice as high as seen in table 5 the biokinetic values and in consequence also the converted biokinetic values conversion from biokinetic values e g mmol prop l 1 into typical values used in the adm1 e g kg cod prop m 3 deviate between the different genera of pob in order to improve the adm1 further the proportion of pob in the respective environment could be useful information in the full scale biowaste wet digester most of the pob 89 belonged to the genus pelotomaculum only about 10 of the pob were species of syntrophobacter and only about 1 of the pob were species of smithella li et al 2015 in order to improve the description of the biological processes related to propionate oxidation the above mentioned proportions of pob were transferred into the adm1xp initially the already existing fraction xpro and the related parameters were tripled according to three described pob and the corresponding processes in the petersen matrix for all three fractions xpro 1 xpro 2 xpro 3 were described in the same way in the next step the values of the biological parameters yield coefficient half saturation coefficient maximum uptake rate for the three new biomass fractions xpro 1 syntrophobacter xpro 2 pelotomaculum xpro 3 smithella were changed according to the observed real proportions of pob during biowaste wet digestion li et al 2015 and converted into dimensions used in adm1 table 5 proportion related biokinetic values as a further step the mathematical description of the biological processes which are linked with the degradation of propionic acid was modified in the model in accordance with the different routes of degradation methyl malonyl coa and c6 dismutation pathway as described in chapter 1 2 the structure of the modified model adm1xpro is shown in fig 3 and the petersen matrix of adm1xpro with the adapted processes is illustrated in table 6 note only the new additional processes the three new pob fractions and other influenced fractions are presented the unchanged processes and fractions are not shown in order to preserve clarity these parts of the petersen matrix can be obtained from batstone et al 2002 the factors fbu pro fh2 pro and fac pro indicate the percentage in relation to the basic unit cod of the three products butyrate hydrogen and acetate which are formed from the source material propionate these three factors have to sum up to 1 this means that the following equation can also be used fbu pro 1 fh2 pro fac pro with the such modified model excellent results were achieved concerning the amount and composition of biogas while maintaining the default value for the parameter c xch 0 0313 this means that arbitrarily changing parameters as described exemplarily in chapter 3 1 were avoided if the exact composition of the pob biomass xpro 1 xpro 2 and xpro 3 is not known an appropriate way would be to set all three fractions equal 33 3 and using the values listed in table 5 adapted biokinetic values rather than to use the default values however if the initial concentrations of all three pob fractions are zeroed large differences are arising only about half of the biogas amount 1170 m³ d 1 is produced and the gas composition changed fundamentally 8 4 ch4 45 2 co2 46 4 h2 3 3 simulation of the wet digestion biowaste plant karlsruhe durlach subsequently the simulation was carried out using the average values for the amount and dosage of substrate for the period from january december 2013 3 3 1 long term analysis period based on the data given in section 2 1 a simulation model of the biowaste digestion plant karlsruhe durlach was created in the simulation software simba 6 6 the system data for the year 2013 show that on average 7 8 pulper each containing 20 m³ substrate were added per day addition of defibered biowaste suspension was carried out from 7 00 a m to 19 00 p m over 12 h same time intervals for addition of pulper loads were assumed resulting in time steps of 1 71 h and the following dosage times 7 00 h 8 71 h 10 43 h 12 14 h 13 86 h 15 57 h 17 29 h 19 00 h eight model blocks biogas tractor were used to integrate the substrate feed into the simulation model of the biogas plant fig 1a shows the system diagram of the plant in simba 6 6 with fixed feeding times as expected after a short adaptation phase the simulation with the adm1xpro over a period of 730 days showed a constant biogas production fig 4 a black line resulting in 3676 m3 maximum biogas yield per day due to the feeding mode of the plant 5 days a week fed batch feeding from 7 00 a m to 7 00 p m slightly different amounts of substrate per pulper the measured biogas amounts showed typically saw tooth shape this saw tooth shape no feeding on saturdays and sundays could be adapted by reducing the calculated results by a corresponding portion of feed leading to an average biogas yield of 2626 m3 per day grey line in fig 4a the biogas production curve for the biowaste digestion plant of karlsruhe durlach shows two periods with very little or no biogas production the first in february 2013 as a result of machine failure and the second during june 2013 when the digester was emptied and completely revised li et al 2014 to take these periods of 59 d into account the simulation for 12 months regular feeding and maximal biogas production black line in fig 4a was repeated for 10 months regular feeding and 59 d revision the calculated average amount of 2201 m³ biogas d 1 containing 68 1 ch4 and 31 9 co2 fig 5 bar adm1xpro was well within the range of the recorded values mean value for biogas production 2171 m³ d 1 containing 67 5 methane and 32 5 co2 see fig 5 bar measurement for comparison the bar adm1xp in the middle of fig 5 shows the simulated biogas composition for the original adm1xp with only one single modification ki nh3 was increased from 0 0018 to 0 008 as described in chapter 3 1 and similar for adm1xpro the improved model adm1xpro could better display or reproduce the real biogas composition containing 67 5 ch4 and 32 5 co2 of a full scale biowaste wet digestion plant with 68 1 ch4 and 31 9 co2 compared to 54 1 ch4 and 45 9 co2 when using adm1xp fig 5 this is important when calculating the profit from selling electricity after conversion of biogas in a chp of actual 14 88 cent per kwh and 500 kw performance of the chp eeg 2017 3 3 2 short term analysis period in order to check whether the model can also reflect daily fluctuations of biogas production fed batch mode of feeding another simulation set up was prepared in this case the input data were imported from an excel file containing the measured values during august 2013 for the time of feeding with a high time resolution in the first step with an interval of 5 min in the second step with an interval of 1 min the values for the input parameters of the substrate content of dry mass organic dry mass nitrogen and ammonia were kept constant because analytical data for the daily substrate composition were not available and working procedures were not changing fig 1b shows the system diagram of the plant in simba 6 6 with the imported real curve of substrate feeding in this case the simulation with the adm1xpro showed a similar trend of biogas production as measured in reality fig 4b lines measured values and simulation with adm1xpro but slight differences concerning curve progression peak shape can still be seen the remaining differences between measured data and simulation are presumably caused by variations of the biowaste composition in a large scale biogas plant it is not possible to analyze the composition content of dry mass organic dry mass cod nitrogen ammonia etc of each substrate batch every day or during different seasons for this reason a slight deviation of process data and simulations seems to be unavoidable for prediction and calculation of main parameters such as biogas amount and biogas composition by changes of the substrate the presented simulations could help to maintain a stable anaerobic digestion process to configurate an appropriate chp and to estimate the electricity and heat amount 4 conclusions the adm1 is a very sophisticated model for anaerobic digestion with many parameters and variation options in principle it would be possible to achieve a satisfying correlation between measurement and simulation by purely mathematical methods optimization algorithms the meaningfulness of such an approach is however doubtful because this is not based on process knowledge and applicability to other data sets is not given this study demonstrated that a reasonable extension of the model by differentiation of general degradation processes into single more detailed processes e g pob and propionate degradation pathways can result in a better match between simulation by using adm1xpro and measurement and thus allows better process

19853,significant progress has been made over recent years in capacitive deionization cdi to develop novel system configurations predictive theoretical models and high performance electrode materials to bring cdi to large scale practical applications it is important to quantitatively understand the intrinsic tradeoff between kinetic and energetic efficiencies or the relationship between energy consumption and the mass transfer rate in this study we employed both experimental and modeling approaches to systematically investigate the tradeoff between kinetic and energetic efficiencies in membrane cdi mcdi specifically we assessed the relationship between the average salt adsorption rate and specific energy consumptions from mcdi experiments with different applied current densities but a constant effluent salinity we investigated the impacts of feed salinity diluted water salinity diluted water volume per charging cycle and electrode materials on the kinetics energetics tradeoff we also demonstrate how this tradeoff can be employed to optimize the design and operation of cdi systems and compare the performance of different electrode materials and cdi systems graphical abstract image 1 keywords capacitive deionization energy consumption kinetic efficiency tradeoff system optimization performance evaluation 1 introduction capacitive deionization cdi is an emerging desalination technology based on the formation of electrical double layer edl in the electrode micropores porada et al 2013 biesheuvel et al 2017 while the state of the art desalination process still remains reverse osmosis ro elimelech and phillip 2011 it has been suggested that cdi may compete with ro for desalinating brackish water with low to moderate salinity zhao et al 2013a anderson et al 2010 welgemoed and schutte 2005 specifically it has been suggested that under certain circumstances cdi is more energy efficient than ro for brackish water desalination but more importantly cdi has other operational advantages that may render it the technology of choice for desalinating inland brackish water especially in remote areas where large scale infrastructure is not accessible oren 2008 mossad et al 2013 for example cdi does not have any high pressure or high temperature components which reduces the capital cost especially for small scale treatment systems cdi is also strongly adaptable the operating conditions can be readily adjusted for different feed water quality and target product water quality zhao et al 2012 in addition the absence of pressure driven permeation in cdi and the presence of periodic reversal of electric field also render cdi less susceptible to fouling problems that are common in ro last but not least cdi is compatible with renewable energy the supply of which is often highly intermittent forrestal et al 2012 the research field of cdi has experienced an exponential growth in the past decade with progress made in multiple directions various system configurations suss et al 2012 porada et al 2012a biesheuvel and van der wal 2010 omosebi et al 2014 gao et al 2015a and operation modes zhao et al 2012 kim et al 2015 garcia quismondo et al 2013 2016 zhao et al 2013b have been developed to enhance the energy efficiency zhao et al 2012 kim et al 2015 garcia quismondo et al 2013 2016 and mass transfer kinetics of cdi zhao et al 2013b to improve the electrodes salt adsorption capacity kim and choi 2010 gao et al 2015b and long term chemical stability gao et al 2015a 2014 and to enable continuous operation suss et al 2012 porada et al 2012a yang et al 2016 in particular the introduction of ion exchange membrane to cdi system to mitigate co ion repulsion has been shown to significantly enhance the energy efficiency of cdi and enable the more flexible and efficient constant current operation biesheuvel and van der wal 2010 lee et al 2006 such a configuration namely membrane cdi mcdi has widely been adopted due to its higher energy efficiency over cdi without membranes zhao et al 2012 omosebi et al 2014 other active research areas in cdi include the development of high performance electrodes porada et al 2012b nadakatti et al 2011 liu et al 2017 duan et al 2017 wang et al 2017a zhao et al 2016 yasin et al 2016 and advancing our fundamental understanding on the energy efficiency of and mass transport phenomena in cdi kim et al 2015 qu et al 2016 zhao et al 2010 tedesco et al 2017 hemmatifar et al 2016 for a given cdi system there are several primary operating parameters to control including applied voltage or current flow rate charging and discharge durations optimizing system design and operation of a cdi system requires understanding the impacts of these parameters on system performance to attain such understanding however system performance first needs to be defined previous studies have investigated the effect of current density on the salt adsorption capacity sac and mass transfer kinetics as quantified by average salt adsorption rate asar kim and yoon 2015 a tradeoff was identified between asar and sac which is analogous to the tradeoff between power density and energy density featured in the famous ragone diagram for supercapacitor however while the sac at a given of operating conditions might be a critical parameter in evaluating the performance of an electrode its implication on practical cdi operations is limited after all what matters most to a desalination process are among other factors how fast the process occurs and how much energy it consumes in other words the kinetic and energetic efficiencies should be the central performance indicators the energy efficiency of a desalination process is often quantified using specific energy consumption sec typically defined as the energy consumed to generate unit volume of product water zhu et al 2009 for cdi however because effluent salinity varies significantly from one process to another sec is more often defined as the energy consumed to remove a unit mole or mass of salt zhao et al 2012 which will be the definition adopted in this study while many existing studies concerned the sec of a cdi operation and reported different ways to improve it the discussion of energy efficiency should not be divorced from that of kinetic efficiency as there is an inherent tradeoff between the two quantifying the tradeoff between kinetic and energetic efficiencies is essential to optimizing the design and operation of an ro system lin and elimelech 2017 which has not been systematically conducted for cdi on the other hand one cannot attain such a tradeoff by simply varying the current density of a cdi operation while maintaining all other parameters constant because operations with different current densities may result in different effluent salinities and thus different underlying separations comparison of sec between cdi processes resulting in different separations is problematic because different separations inherently require different gibbs free energy of separation wang et al 2017b biesheuvel 2009 jcis therefore a rational comparison of kinetic and energetic performance between different cdi operations has to be conducted in a way that the effluent salinity and the underlying separations are kept constant in this study we experimentally and theoretically quantify the kinetics energetics tradeoff in mcdi the configuration of mcdi is chosen because 1 it is significantly more energy efficient than cdi without ion exchange membrane and thus expected to be more widely adopted in practice and 2 because it allows constant current charging which is the chosen operation mode in our study the kinetics energetics tradeoff is quantified using asar and the inverse of specific energy consumption sec 1 from mcdi experiments in which the current density and flowrate are simultaneously adjusted to achieve the same separations with different kinetic efficiencies we also systematically assess the impacts of several parameters on the kinetics energetics tradeoff these parameters include the feed salinity diluted water salinity diluted water volume per charging cycle and electrode materials finally we discuss the implications of these tradeoff curves and demonstrate how they can be employed for optimizing system design and operation and for comparing the performance of electrode materials 2 materials and methods 2 1 mcdi module the mcdi stack comprised 4 parallel cells that were sandwiched in an acrylic housing two types of electrode a film electrode casted with activated carbon particles pacmm pacmm 203 material methods irvine ca usa δe1 290 μm and an activated carbon cloth fm10k zorflex pittsburg pa usa δe2 350 μm were used in this study each cell consists of a pair of graphite foil as current collectors alfa aesar thickness δ 130 μm a pair of porous electrodes pacmm or fm 10 k a pair of anion and cation exchange membranes neosepta amx δmem 140 μm and neosepta cmx δmem 170 μm tokuyama co japan and a glass fiber spacer whatman δ 250 μm each electrode was cut to a 6 6 cm2 square with a 1 5 1 5 cm2 square hole at the center yielding a total active electrode area of 270 cm2 for the entire stack a peristaltic pump drives the water to enter from the periphery of the square mcdi stack flow along the spacers sandwiched between the ion exchange membrane electrode assemblies and exit from the center square hole a schematic showing the mcdi structure and flow direction is provided in the supplementary information fig s1 the total mass of the 4 pairs of electrodes were 2 56 g and 4 29 g for pacmm and fm 10 k respectively 2 2 experimental methods and design nacl solutions were used as the model feed solution throughout the study the feed solution was stored in a 10l feed tank with constant nitrogen purging to minimize the oxygen content for mitigating electrode oxidation the feed solution was pumped through the mcdi stack by a peristaltic pump and the effluent of mcdi stack was sent back to the feed tank the conductivity of the effluent was measured by a flow through conductivity meter isopod ep357 edaq australia installed right at the exit of the stack which was further converted into salt concentration according to a pre established calibration curve fig s2 although ph fluctuation has been observed in previous cdi experiments due to possible oxidation reduction of the carbon electrodes dykstra et al 2017 he et al 2016 the measured concentrations of h or oh in the effluent was orders of magnitude lower than the nacl concentration used in our experiments it is therefore reasonable to assume that the removal of nacl by a pair of electrodes is symmetric i e equal amount of na and cl ions are removed in the cdi system desalination performance was evaluated with constant current charging and zero voltage discharge as controlled using a potentiostat sp 150 bio logic france that recorded the real time current and cell voltage to obtain a kinetics energetics trade off curve we conducted mcdi experiments with different current densities and evaluated the asar mg g min 1 which represents the kinetic efficiency and sec j mg 1 which represents the energy efficiency previous studies using different current densities adopted an operation protocol that used a constant flow rate and terminated the charging when the cell voltage reached a pre determined value zhao et al 2012 kim and yoon 2015 however such a protocol led to different effluent salinities and thus achieved different underlying separations in this study we choose to use a different approach by adjusting the flow rate to the various charging currents to maintain the same effluent salinity and thereby achieving the same underlying separation with different current densities the flow rates leading to the target effluent salinity were obtained using a trial and error approach the impacts of feed concentration c 0 diluted water concentration c d volume of diluted water v d i e volume of the effluent in the charging stage and electrode materials on the kinetics energetics tradeoff were systematically evaluated with detailed conditions for different sets of experiments summarized in table 1 2 3 data analysis the kinetic efficiency of mcdi operations were quantified using asar defined as the mass of salt removed per gram of electrode per time we only evaluated the asar for the charging half cycle following convention even though asar can also be defined based on the full charging and discharge cycle asar mg g min 1 is calculated according to the following equation 1 a s a r m w n a c l q 0 t c c 0 c t d t w e t c where m w n a c l is the molecular weight of nacl c 0 is the salt concentration mm of the feed or influent stream c t is the effluent salt concentration mm and should be constant short after charging starts q is the flowrate l min 1 w e is the total mass of electrodes g and t c is the charging time min the energetic efficiency of the process is quantified using sec defined as the energy consumed j to remove a unit mass of salt mg sec is calculated using equation 2 from experimental data 2 s e c i 0 t c v t d t m w n a c l q 0 t c c 0 c t d t where i is the applied current a and v t is the time dependent cell voltage v in this study we will quantify the kinetics energetics tradeoff using the relationship between asar and the inverse of sec i e sec 1 unit mg j 1 the interpretation of sec 1 is the mass of salt removed per amount of energy spent which also serves equally well if not even better as an intuitive metric for energy efficiency the charge efficiency defined as the ratio between the salt removal and the electrical charge transferred between the electrodes is calculated following equation 3 3 λ q f 0 t c c 0 c t d t 60 i t c where f is the faraday constant 3 theoretical modeling we employed a one dimensional mcdi model to fit our experimental data the model only considers transport of ions in the direction normal to the membrane electrode assembly which is a reasonable approximation as the average travel distance along the spacer was only 2 6 cm in our system the model assumes two scales of porosity for the electrode material nanoscale micropores which are responsible for the majority of the ion adsorption capacity and microscale macropores which provide pathway for fast ion transport the modified donnan md model is employed to describe the potential difference between micropores and macropores porada et al 2012b 2012c biesheuvel et al 2011 porada et al 2012c various resistive and interfacial potential drops within the cell are considered so are external resistive potential drops outside the cell dykstra et al 2016 tang et al 2017 the spacer channel resistance varies as ions are removed from or released to the spacer channel and is thus time dependent zhao et al 2013b the details of the model derivation are provided in supplementary information 4 results and discussion 4 1 experimental results and model validation four series and eleven sets of experiments including 55 experiments in total were conducted to investigate the effects of diluted water concentration feed concentration diluted water volume per charging half cycle and electrode materials fig 1 a presents the experimental data solid curves for one set of experiments c 0 20 mm c d 13 mm and v d 28 5 ml with pacmm electrodes upon the initiation of charging the effluent concentrations declined and reached a stable effluent concentration the target c d before long within this set of experiments the flowrates were adjusted according to the applied current to maintain the same effluent concentration the increase of flowrate is reflected by the shorter time for the charging half cycle because the total diluted water volume was kept at 28 5 ml the voltages across the mcdi stack increased sharply upon the start of charging and then transitioned to a linear regime fig 1b both the starting voltages and the slopes of linear regime were larger with higher currents because the concentration dependent spacer resistance increased faster due to faster removal of charged ions at higher current experimental asar and sec 1 were calculated following the method described in data analysis with the results shown in fig 1b these results correspond to the raw data presented in fig 1a as the electrical current increased from 40 ma to 120 ma asar increased roughly proportional to the increase of the current from 0 51 to 1 34 mg g 1 min 1 on the other hand sec 1 diminished from 0 72 mg j 1 at 40 ma to 0 35 mg j 1 at 120 ma the opposite trends of asar and sec 1 with respect to increasing electrical current clearly demonstrate the trade off between the kinetic and energetic efficiencies in a mcdi processes a faster process can be attained at the cost of spending more energy to achieve the same separation this trade off will be systematically discussed in the following sections it is also worth noting that the charge efficiency also decreased with increasing current but only to a small extent fig 1b the charge efficiency by definition captures how much energy spent on transferring charges is actually utilized in removing ions however it does not account for how fast the charges are transferred and the ions removed which certainly has a strong impact on the energy consumption based on the kinetic energetic tradeoff therefore charge efficiency should not be interpreted as equivalent to energy efficiency the experimental results from fig 1a are fitted with simulated results from the mcdi transport model described in the theory section with details provided in supplementary information with a single set of parameters for each electrode consistent with those reported in literature and being used consistently in all our simulations table 2 the mcdi model can generate simulation results that fit the experimental results with excellent precision the experimental and simulation results are particularly matched for the charging half cycle which is of the most significance in the current study theoretical predictions of sec 1 and asar from the simulated effluent concentration and cell voltage profiles were also validated using the experimentally measured results fig 1b overall the mcdi dynamic ion transport model can provide very good prediction of the system performance of our mcdi stack 4 2 tradeoff between kinetic and energetic efficiencies the asar vs sec 1 curves for the four series experiments summarized in table 1 are presented in fig 2 in all cases the concave negative correlations between asar and sec 1 which are characteristic of the kinetics energetics tradeoff can be observed in general an operation that leads to both high asar and sec 1 i e toward the upper right of the figures is preferred however practical operations are governed by the tradeoff between asar and sec 1 and thus have to be optimized within such a constraint fig 2a shows that attaining a lower diluted water concentration c d shifted the tradeoff curves towards the left i e the operations become systematically less favorable specifically when the mcdi system is operated to remove more salt from a given volume 28 5 ml of a given feed water 20 mm either the process became slower as reflected by a lower asar if the energy efficiency was maintained constant or the process became less energy efficient as quantified by a lower sec 1 if the mass transfer rate were maintained constant this shift of the tradeoff curve has two mechanistic contributions first reducing a feed solution of a given concentration c 0 to different diluted water concentrations c d results in different underlying separations the specific gibbs free energy of separation which is the theoretical minimum energy required to achieve separation in a thermodynamically reversible manner is higher if the difference between c 0 and c d is larger wang et al 2017b biesheuvel 2009 perhaps more importantly the lower c d also leads to a lower average ionic conductivity in the spacer channel thereby increasing the overall ionic resistance of the system dykstra et al 2016 these two effects both increased the sec at a given mass transfer kinetic rate and thus shift the tradeoff curve toward the unfavorable direction in the second series of experiments c d was maintained at 13 mm whereas c 0 increased from 16 2 mm to 24 2 mm increasing c 0 has a similar qualitative impact as decreasing c d but to a less extent the two effects that both increase the sec when c d is reduced as discussed in fig 2a act against each other when c 0 is increased on the one hand increasing c 0 results in a higher specific gibbs free energy of separation on the other hand a higher c 0 also reduces the overall ionic resistance of the spacer channel especially near the cell entrance the shift of the asar vs sec 1 curve in response to changing c 0 as shown in fig 2b suggests that the first effect slightly outcompetes the second effect when c 0 and c d are both specified increasing the diluted water volume per charging half cycle v d entails storing more ions in the micropores of the electrode consequently the mcdi stack has to be charged to a higher voltage to generate a higher donnan potential according to the modified donnan theory employed in the mcdi transport model for this reason an mcdi system with a higher v d should theoretically consume more energy as the average cell voltage is higher yet the current is maintained constant both experimental and simulated results in fig 2c support this hypothesis but the impact is relatively insignificant increasing v d from 19 ml to 33 ml only resulted in a small shift of the experimental asar vs sec 1 curve which was also confirmed by the results simulated from the mcdi transport model the electrode materials used in the mcdi stack seems to have a very significant impact on the position of the tradeoff curve fig 2d shows that pacmm electrode was appreciably better than the fm10k carbon cloth electrode with the pacmm electrode the mcdi system consumed far less energy to achieve a given asar or attained much faster salt removal with a given level of energy consumption the better performance of the pacmm electrode over that of fm10k electrode can be explained by the significantly lower electrode resistance and higher microporosity as suggested by the fitting parameters for the mcdi transport model table 2 it is worth mentioning that the mcdi stacks with both fm 10 k and pacmm electrodes yielded similarly high charge efficiency a parameter often employed to gauge the energy efficiency of cdi processes in general therefore the asar vs sec 1 curves provide valuable information regarding the performance of the cdi system that neither charge efficiency nor sac can fully capture 5 practical implications for system design the tradeoff between kinetic and energetic efficiencies is universal intrinsic and important for all desalination processes regardless of the technological platforms more energy is always required to achieve a faster process that generates more entropy spiegler and el sayed 2001 mistry et al 2011 indeed the most energy efficient process is a thermodynamically reversible process that is infinitely slow and generates no entropy smith et al 2005 while the thermodynamic principle behind such a tradeoff may seem straightforward and well known quantifying this tradeoff is important for optimizing system design and operation which will be illustrated below imagine building a brackish water desalination plant based on mcdi for a certain community the feed water and diluted water

capital cost but the costs of other components including ion exchange membranes current collectors and spacer all scale with the electrode mass to reduce the capital cost one can reduce the electrode mass by enhancing asar via increasing the current density which however inevitably leads to a lower sec 1 or higher sec that has a significant impact on the operating cost the analysis above suggests that the fundamental tradeoff between asar and sec 1 eventually becomes the practical tradeoff between capital and operating costs and that optimizing the system design and operation comes down to selecting the optimal applied current density conducting such a techno economic optimization is beyond the scope of this paper as it involves many practical cost considerations and assumptions in

19853,significant progress has been made over recent years in capacitive deionization cdi to develop novel system configurations predictive theoretical models and high performance electrode materials to bring cdi to large scale practical applications it is important to quantitatively understand the intrinsic tradeoff between kinetic and energetic efficiencies or the relationship between energy consumption and the mass transfer rate in this study we employed both experimental and modeling approaches to systematically investigate the tradeoff between kinetic and energetic efficiencies in membrane cdi mcdi specifically we assessed the relationship between the average salt adsorption rate and specific energy consumptions from mcdi experiments with different applied current densities but a constant effluent salinity we investigated the impacts of feed salinity diluted water salinity diluted water volume per charging cycle and electrode materials on the kinetics energetics tradeoff we also demonstrate how this tradeoff can be employed to optimize the design and operation of cdi systems and compare the performance of different electrode materials and cdi systems graphical abstract image 1 keywords capacitive deionization energy consumption kinetic efficiency tradeoff system optimization performance evaluation 1 introduction capacitive deionization cdi is an emerging desalination technology based on the formation of electrical double layer edl in the electrode micropores porada et al 2013 biesheuvel et al 2017 while the state of the art desalination process still remains reverse osmosis ro elimelech and phillip 2011 it has been suggested that cdi may compete with ro for desalinating brackish water with low to moderate salinity zhao et al 2013a anderson et al 2010 welgemoed and schutte 2005 specifically it has been suggested that under certain circumstances cdi is more energy efficient than ro for brackish water desalination but more importantly cdi has other operational advantages that may render it the technology of choice for desalinating inland brackish water especially in remote areas where large scale infrastructure is not accessible oren 2008 mossad et al 2013 for example cdi does not have any high pressure or high temperature components which reduces the capital cost especially for small scale treatment systems cdi is also strongly adaptable the operating conditions can be readily adjusted for different feed water quality and target product water quality zhao et al 2012 in addition the absence of pressure driven permeation in cdi and the presence of periodic reversal of electric field also render cdi less susceptible to fouling problems that are common in ro last but not least cdi is compatible with renewable energy the supply of which is often highly intermittent forrestal et al 2012 the research field of cdi has experienced an exponential growth in the past decade with progress made in multiple directions various system configurations suss et al 2012 porada et al 2012a biesheuvel and van der wal 2010 omosebi et al 2014 gao et al 2015a and operation modes zhao et al 2012 kim et al 2015 garcia quismondo et al 2013 2016 zhao et al 2013b have been developed to enhance the energy efficiency zhao et al 2012 kim et al 2015 garcia quismondo et al 2013 2016 and mass transfer kinetics of cdi zhao et al 2013b to improve the electrodes salt adsorption capacity kim and choi 2010 gao et al 2015b and long term chemical stability gao et al 2015a 2014 and to enable continuous operation suss et al 2012 porada et al 2012a yang et al 2016 in particular the introduction of ion exchange membrane to cdi system to mitigate co ion repulsion has been shown to significantly enhance the energy efficiency of cdi and enable the more flexible and efficient constant current operation biesheuvel and van der wal 2010 lee et al 2006 such a configuration namely membrane cdi mcdi has widely been adopted due to its higher energy efficiency over cdi without membranes zhao et al 2012 omosebi et al 2014 other active research areas in cdi include the development of high performance electrodes porada et al 2012b nadakatti et al 2011 liu et al 2017 duan et al 2017 wang et al 2017a zhao et al 2016 yasin et al 2016 and advancing our fundamental understanding on the energy efficiency of and mass transport phenomena in cdi kim et al 2015 qu et al 2016 zhao et al 2010 tedesco et al 2017 hemmatifar et al 2016 for a given cdi system there are several primary operating parameters to control including applied voltage or current flow rate charging and discharge durations optimizing system design and operation of a cdi system requires understanding the impacts of these parameters on system performance to attain such understanding however system performance first needs to be defined previous studies have investigated the effect of current density on the salt adsorption capacity sac and mass transfer kinetics as quantified by average salt adsorption rate asar kim and yoon 2015 a tradeoff was identified between asar and sac which is analogous to the tradeoff between power density and energy density featured in the famous ragone diagram for supercapacitor however while the sac at a given of operating conditions might be a critical parameter in evaluating the performance of an electrode its implication on practical cdi operations is limited after all what matters most to a desalination process are among other factors how fast the process occurs and how much energy it consumes in other words the kinetic and energetic efficiencies should be the central performance indicators the energy efficiency of a desalination process is often quantified using specific energy consumption sec typically defined as the energy consumed to generate unit volume of product water zhu et al 2009 for cdi however because effluent salinity varies significantly from one process to another sec is more often defined as the energy consumed to remove a unit mole or mass of salt zhao et al 2012 which will be the definition adopted in this study while many existing studies concerned the sec of a cdi operation and reported different ways to improve it the discussion of energy efficiency should not be divorced from that of kinetic efficiency as there is an inherent tradeoff between the two quantifying the tradeoff between kinetic and energetic efficiencies is essential to optimizing the design and operation of an ro system lin and elimelech 2017 which has not been systematically conducted for cdi on the other hand one cannot attain such a tradeoff by simply varying the current density of a cdi operation while maintaining all other parameters constant because operations with different current densities may result in different effluent salinities and thus different underlying separations comparison of sec between cdi processes resulting in different separations is problematic because different separations inherently require different gibbs free energy of separation wang et al 2017b biesheuvel 2009 jcis therefore a rational comparison of kinetic and energetic performance between different cdi operations has to be conducted in a way that the effluent salinity and the underlying separations are kept constant in this study we experimentally and theoretically quantify the kinetics energetics tradeoff in mcdi the configuration of mcdi is chosen because 1 it is significantly more energy efficient than cdi without ion exchange membrane and thus expected to be more widely adopted in practice and 2 because it allows constant current charging which is the chosen operation mode in our study the kinetics energetics tradeoff is quantified using asar and the inverse of specific energy consumption sec 1 from mcdi experiments in which the current density and flowrate are simultaneously adjusted to achieve the same separations with different kinetic efficiencies we also systematically assess the impacts of several parameters on the kinetics energetics tradeoff these parameters include the feed salinity diluted water salinity diluted water volume per charging cycle and electrode materials finally we discuss the implications of these tradeoff curves and demonstrate how they can be employed for optimizing system design and operation and for comparing the performance of electrode materials 2 materials and methods 2 1 mcdi module the mcdi stack comprised 4 parallel cells that were sandwiched in an acrylic housing two types of electrode a film electrode casted with activated carbon particles pacmm pacmm 203 material methods irvine ca usa δe1 290 μm and an activated carbon cloth fm10k zorflex pittsburg pa usa δe2 350 μm were used in this study each cell consists of a pair of graphite foil as current collectors alfa aesar thickness δ 130 μm a pair of porous electrodes pacmm or fm 10 k a pair of anion and cation exchange membranes neosepta amx δmem 140 μm and neosepta cmx δmem 170 μm tokuyama co japan and a glass fiber spacer whatman δ 250 μm each electrode was cut to a 6 6 cm2 square with a 1 5 1 5 cm2 square hole at the center yielding a total active electrode area of 270 cm2 for the entire stack a peristaltic pump drives the water to enter from the periphery of the square mcdi stack flow along the spacers sandwiched between the ion exchange membrane electrode assemblies and exit from the center square hole a schematic showing the mcdi structure and flow direction is provided in the supplementary information fig s1 the total mass of the 4 pairs of electrodes were 2 56 g and 4 29 g for pacmm and fm 10 k respectively 2 2 experimental methods and design nacl solutions were used as the model feed solution throughout the study the feed solution was stored in a 10l feed tank with constant nitrogen purging to minimize the oxygen content for mitigating electrode oxidation the feed solution was pumped through the mcdi stack by a peristaltic pump and the effluent of mcdi stack was sent back to the feed tank the conductivity of the effluent was measured by a flow through conductivity meter isopod ep357 edaq australia installed right at the exit of the stack which was further converted into salt concentration according to a pre established calibration curve fig s2 although ph fluctuation has been observed in previous cdi experiments due to possible oxidation reduction of the carbon electrodes dykstra et al 2017 he et al 2016 the measured concentrations of h or oh in the effluent was orders of magnitude lower than the nacl concentration used in our experiments it is therefore reasonable to assume that the removal of nacl by a pair of electrodes is symmetric i e equal amount of na and cl ions are removed in the cdi system desalination performance was evaluated with constant current charging and zero voltage discharge as controlled using a potentiostat sp 150 bio logic france that recorded the real time current and cell voltage to obtain a kinetics energetics trade off curve we conducted mcdi experiments with different current densities and evaluated the asar mg g min 1 which represents the kinetic efficiency and sec j mg 1 which represents the energy efficiency previous studies using different current densities adopted an operation protocol that used a constant flow rate and terminated the charging when the cell voltage reached a pre determined value zhao et al 2012 kim and yoon 2015 however such a protocol led to different effluent salinities and thus achieved different underlying separations in this study we choose to use a different approach by adjusting the flow rate to the various charging currents to maintain the same effluent salinity and thereby achieving the same underlying separation with different current densities the flow rates leading to the target effluent salinity were obtained using a trial and error approach the impacts of feed concentration c 0 diluted water concentration c d volume of diluted water v d i e volume of the effluent in the charging stage and electrode materials on the kinetics energetics tradeoff were systematically evaluated with detailed conditions for different sets of experiments summarized in table 1 2 3 data analysis the kinetic efficiency of mcdi operations were quantified using asar defined as the mass of salt removed per gram of electrode per time we only evaluated the asar for the charging half cycle following convention even though asar can also be defined based on the full charging and discharge cycle asar mg g min 1 is calculated according to the following equation 1 a s a r m w n a c l q 0 t c c 0 c t d t w e t c where m w n a c l is the molecular weight of nacl c 0 is the salt concentration mm of the feed or influent stream c t is the effluent salt concentration mm and should be constant short after charging starts q is the flowrate l min 1 w e is the total mass of electrodes g and t c is the charging time min the energetic efficiency of the process is quantified using sec defined as the energy consumed j to remove a unit mass of salt mg sec is calculated using equation 2 from experimental data 2 s e c i 0 t c v t d t m w n a c l q 0 t c c 0 c t d t where i is the applied current a and v t is the time dependent cell voltage v in this study we will quantify the kinetics energetics tradeoff using the relationship between asar and the inverse of sec i e sec 1 unit mg j 1 the interpretation of sec 1 is the mass of salt removed per amount of energy spent which also serves equally well if not even better as an intuitive metric for energy efficiency the charge efficiency defined as the ratio between the salt removal and the electrical charge transferred between the electrodes is calculated following equation 3 3 λ q f 0 t c c 0 c t d t 60 i t c where f is the faraday constant 3 theoretical modeling we employed a one dimensional mcdi model to fit our experimental data the model only considers transport of ions in the direction normal to the membrane electrode assembly which is a reasonable approximation as the average travel distance along the spacer was only 2 6 cm in our system the model assumes two scales of porosity for the electrode material nanoscale micropores which are responsible for the majority of the ion adsorption capacity and microscale macropores which provide pathway for fast ion transport the modified donnan md model is employed to describe the potential difference between micropores and macropores porada et al 2012b 2012c biesheuvel et al 2011 porada et al 2012c various resistive and interfacial potential drops within the cell are considered so are external resistive potential drops outside the cell dykstra et al 2016 tang et al 2017 the spacer channel resistance varies as ions are removed from or released to the spacer channel and is thus time dependent zhao et al 2013b the details of the model derivation are provided in supplementary information 4 results and discussion 4 1 experimental results and model validation four series and eleven sets of experiments including 55 experiments in total were conducted to investigate the effects of diluted water concentration feed concentration diluted water volume per charging half cycle and electrode materials fig 1 a presents the experimental data solid curves for one set of experiments c 0 20 mm c d 13 mm and v d 28 5 ml with pacmm electrodes upon the initiation of charging the effluent concentrations declined and reached a stable effluent concentration the target c d before long within this set of experiments the flowrates were adjusted according to the applied current to maintain the same effluent concentration the increase of flowrate is reflected by the shorter time for the charging half cycle because the total diluted water volume was kept at 28 5 ml the voltages across the mcdi stack increased sharply upon the start of charging and then transitioned to a linear regime fig 1b both the starting voltages and the slopes of linear regime were larger with higher currents because the concentration dependent spacer resistance increased faster due to faster removal of charged ions at higher current experimental asar and sec 1 were calculated following the method described in data analysis with the results shown in fig 1b these results correspond to the raw data presented in fig 1a as the electrical current increased from 40 ma to 120 ma asar increased roughly proportional to the increase of the current from 0 51 to 1 34 mg g 1 min 1 on the other hand sec 1 diminished from 0 72 mg j 1 at 40 ma to 0 35 mg j 1 at 120 ma the opposite trends of asar and sec 1 with respect to increasing electrical current clearly demonstrate the trade off between the kinetic and energetic efficiencies in a mcdi processes a faster process can be attained at the cost of spending more energy to achieve the same separation this trade off will be systematically discussed in the following sections it is also worth noting that the charge efficiency also decreased with increasing current but only to a small extent fig 1b the charge efficiency by definition captures how much energy spent on transferring charges is actually utilized in removing ions however it does not account for how fast the charges are transferred and the ions removed which certainly has a strong impact on the energy consumption based on the kinetic energetic tradeoff therefore charge efficiency should not be interpreted as equivalent to energy efficiency the experimental results from fig 1a are fitted with simulated results from the mcdi transport model described in the theory section with details provided in supplementary information with a single set of parameters for each electrode consistent with those reported in literature and being used consistently in all our simulations table 2 the mcdi model can generate simulation results that fit the experimental results with excellent precision the experimental and simulation results are particularly matched for the charging half cycle which is of the most significance in the current study theoretical predictions of sec 1 and asar from the simulated effluent concentration and cell voltage profiles were also validated using the experimentally measured results fig 1b overall the mcdi dynamic ion transport model can provide very good prediction of the system performance of our mcdi stack 4 2 tradeoff between kinetic and energetic efficiencies the asar vs sec 1 curves for the four series experiments summarized in table 1 are presented in fig 2 in all cases the concave negative correlations between asar and sec 1 which are characteristic of the kinetics energetics tradeoff can be observed in general an operation that leads to both high asar and sec 1 i e toward the upper right of the figures is preferred however practical operations are governed by the tradeoff between asar and sec 1 and thus have to be optimized within such a constraint fig 2a shows that attaining a lower diluted water concentration c d shifted the tradeoff curves towards the left i e the operations become systematically less favorable specifically when the mcdi system is operated to remove more salt from a given volume 28 5 ml of a given feed water 20 mm either the process became slower as reflected by a lower asar if the energy efficiency was maintained constant or the process became less energy efficient as quantified by a lower sec 1 if the mass transfer rate were maintained constant this shift of the tradeoff curve has two mechanistic contributions first reducing a feed solution of a given concentration c 0 to different diluted water concentrations c d results in different underlying separations the specific gibbs free energy of separation which is the theoretical minimum energy required to achieve separation in a thermodynamically reversible manner is higher if the difference between c 0 and c d is larger wang et al 2017b biesheuvel 2009 perhaps more importantly the lower c d also leads to a lower average ionic conductivity in the spacer channel thereby increasing the overall ionic resistance of the system dykstra et al 2016 these two effects both increased the sec at a given mass transfer kinetic rate and thus shift the tradeoff curve toward the unfavorable direction in the second series of experiments c d was maintained at 13 mm whereas c 0 increased from 16 2 mm to 24 2 mm increasing c 0 has a similar qualitative impact as decreasing c d but to a less extent the two effects that both increase the sec when c d is reduced as discussed in fig 2a act against each other when c 0 is increased on the one hand increasing c 0 results in a higher specific gibbs free energy of separation on the other hand a higher c 0 also reduces the overall ionic resistance of the spacer channel especially near the cell entrance the shift of the asar vs sec 1 curve in response to changing c 0 as shown in fig 2b suggests that the first effect slightly outcompetes the second effect when c 0 and c d are both specified increasing the diluted water volume per charging half cycle v d entails storing more ions in the micropores of the electrode consequently the mcdi stack has to be charged to a higher voltage to generate a higher donnan potential according to the modified donnan theory employed in the mcdi transport model for this reason an mcdi system with a higher v d should theoretically consume more energy as the average cell voltage is higher yet the current is maintained constant both experimental and simulated results in fig 2c support this hypothesis but the impact is relatively insignificant increasing v d from 19 ml to 33 ml only resulted in a small shift of the experimental asar vs sec 1 curve which was also confirmed by the results simulated from the mcdi transport model the electrode materials used in the mcdi stack seems to have a very significant impact on the position of the tradeoff curve fig 2d shows that pacmm electrode was appreciably better than the fm10k carbon cloth electrode with the pacmm electrode the mcdi system consumed far less energy to achieve a given asar or attained much faster salt removal with a given level of energy consumption the better performance of the pacmm electrode over that of fm10k electrode can be explained by the significantly lower electrode resistance and higher microporosity as suggested by the fitting parameters for the mcdi transport model table 2 it is worth mentioning that the mcdi stacks with both fm 10 k and pacmm electrodes yielded similarly high charge efficiency a parameter often employed to gauge the energy efficiency of cdi processes in general therefore the asar vs sec 1 curves provide valuable information regarding the performance of the cdi system that neither charge efficiency nor sac can fully capture 5 practical implications for system design the tradeoff between kinetic and energetic efficiencies is universal intrinsic and important for all desalination processes regardless of the technological platforms more energy is always required to achieve a faster process that generates more entropy spiegler and el sayed 2001 mistry et al 2011 indeed the most energy efficient process is a thermodynamically reversible process that is infinitely slow and generates no entropy smith et al 2005 while the thermodynamic principle behind such a tradeoff may seem straightforward and well known quantifying this tradeoff is important for

maintain a constant c d of 10 mm which yields a set of data in the form of a s a r vs sec 1 as presented in fig 2a because the target service capacity is essentially the water flowrate of the mcdi system to be designed q we can employ equations 3 and 4 to translate the more fundamental a s a r vs sec 1 curve fig 3a into an m e vs s e c curve fig 3b that allows more straightforward

very different solubility of fe iii p and fe ii p complex and the microbial transformation of fe iii to fe ii were utilized for p removal and recovery by means of fe induced precipitation chemical p removal was effectively achieved by an mbr with a flat plate ceramic membrane however the fe iii p solids accumulated in the mbr that constituted a significant fraction of the activated sludge anaerobic co fermentation of the mbr sludge and food waste in a side stream allowed the extraction of p and fe from the sludge into the supernatant the p in the supernatant was recovered as a fertilizer resource while the sludge was returned to the mbr tank the experimental results show that by adding fecl3 at 20 mg fe l into the influent of domestic wastewater about 95 6 of total p could be removed by the mbr one fifth 20 of the sludge in the mbr was circulated daily through the side stream fermenters for co fermentation with cooked rice as the model food waste the sludge underwent acidogenesis and dissimilatory iron reduction resulting in a drop of the ph to below 5 0 and reduction of fe iii to fe ii owing to the high solubility of the fe ii p complex p and fe were then dissolved and released from the sludge into the supernatant by simply adjusting the solution ph to 8 0 the p and fe ii in the supernatant readily re precipitated to form vivianite for the p recovery

global food security around 20 million tons mt of p are mined globally every year cordell et al 2011 the demand for p continues to increase because of growing population and food consumption which may lead to depletion of the global p rock reserves by the end of this century every year about 3 mt of p is lost as human waste and about 1 3 mt p is treated in municipal wastewater treatment plants worldwide van vuuren et al 2010 it has been estimated that recovery of p from wastewater would satisfy 15 20 of global demand for p cordell et al 2009 and increasing efforts are made to drive forward p recovery recently a new sewage sludge ordinance passed by the german cabinet will make p recovery from sewage sludge obligatory for all large german wastewater treatment plants bmub 2017 currently most technologies for p recovery are focused on waste sludge or sludge ash desmidt et al 2015 egle et al 2015 and acidification is commonly applied to extract p from the sludge mayer et al 2016 however those chemical methods use large amounts of strong acids petzet et al 2012 and the residual sludge requires further neutralisation and treatment before disposal the operating difficulties and high costs involved hinder the actual application of the chemical extraction process for p recovery from wastewater sartorius et al 2012 membrane bioreactor mbr is a new generation of wastewater treatment technology that has been increasingly applied in recent years mbrs are able to achieve complete solid liquid separation and a long sludge retention time srt thereby greatly increasing the biomass concentration and diversity and reducing the sludge yield in the bioreactors judd 2010 the mbr configuration continues to evolve for more versatile and cost effective applications new materials such as ceramic membranes have also been adopted in mbrs owing to their long durability low fouling propensity and resistance to chemical cleaning li et al 2011 with chemical precipitation mbrs can be effectively used for p removal in wastewater treatment liu et al 2011 simple addition of fe coagulant into mbrs can consistently remove p from the effluent and help mitigate the membrane fouling problem yang et al 2011 however chemical precipitation and membrane filtration result in a significant accumulation of inorganic precipitates in the sludge of the mbrs the vss ss ratio of the mbr sludge was found to decrease from 75 to 64 after a 30 d operation with fe based chemical dosing and that ratio would continue to decrease under the long srt 30 60 d condition do et al 2012 the accumulation of inactive sludge in the mbr lowers the biomass content and affects the sludge bioactivity for wastewater treatment fan et al 2015 thus the p and fe contents should constantly be removed from the mbr sludge suspension without affecting the biomass concentration and srt the p extracted from the mbr sludge also can be recovered as a valuable resource in fact wilfert et al 2016 suggested a new route of p recovery from iron dosing sludge by forming vivianite based on the redox state of iron in this study a novel integration of the mbr with the sludge fermentation was developed for effective p removal and recovery in municipal wastewater treatment the process makes use of an aerobic mbr tank with fe dosing to achieve enhanced p removal and side stream acidogenic co fermentation to extract p from the mbr sludge for recovery unlike chemical acidification biological acidogenesis can lower the sludge ph for p extraction without deactivating the biomass dissimilatory iron reduction during the anaerobic sludge fermentation led to p release into the liquid phase of the sludge in addition food waste was added for co fermentation and sludge acidogenesis kim et al 2016 after p release and recovery the activated sludge was returned to the aerobic mbr tank for wastewater treatment long term experimental study was conducted the performance of the new process for p removal and recovery was evaluated and p and fe transformation during the process was investigated and modelled 2 materials and methods 2 1 wastewater raw sewage was collected from a local municipal wastewater treatment plant stanley sewage treatment works sstw hong kong as the wastewater influent for the experimental study this was either used on the same day of collection or preserved in a refrigerator at 4 c for less than 1 week to prevent changes in quality the main water quality parameters of the wastewater influent recorded for the different experimental phases are summarised in table 1 2 2 experimental set up an integrated system with an mbr and its side stream sludge fermentation was developed for the enhanced wastewater treatment and p recovery fig 1 the aerobic mbr tank was made of plexiglass with an inner dimension of 200 150 400 mm length width height and a working volume of about 8 l a flat plate ceramic membrane module with an average pore size of 100 nm meidensha corporation japan was vertically submerged in the membrane tank the membrane plate had a dimension of 240 80 5 9 mm length width thickness and an effective surface area of 0 0384 m2 the mbr tank was filled with activated sludge for biological wastewater treatment with a mixed liquor suspended solids concentration kept within a range of 4 0 5 5 g l for treatment by the mbr the wastewater influent was pre flocculated by fecl3 at a dosage of 20 mg fe l and the mixture without sedimentation was pumped into the mbr tank fe iii based chemical dosing was applied to induce precipitation and flocculation for enhanced p removal and a low p concentration in the effluent zhang et al 2015 effluent from the mbr was withdrawn through the ceramic membrane by a suction pump master flex cole parmer aiming at a constant flow rate of 16 6 l d corresponding to a hydraulic retention time hrt of 12 h and a flux of 17 4 l h m2 lhm the effluent suction pump was controlled by a programmable logic controller for 5 h 55 min on and 5 min off in each operation cycle 4 cycles d when the suction pump was off the membrane module was backwashed with the treated effluent for 5 min at a flux of 46 9 lhm the transmembrane pressure tmp was recorded during the mbr operation when it exceeded 30 kpa the membrane module was removed and washed with running tap water to remove the foulants from the membrane surface and restore its permeability periodically e g once every one month the ceramic membrane was chemically washed by chemical washing the membrane was backwashed with 600 ml 0 1 m naoh 20 ml min followed by 600 ml 0 1 m hcl 20 ml min and then 600 ml tap water 20 ml min anaerobic reactors were operated for sludge fermentation in a side stream mode coupling with the mbr fig 1 glass bottles 1 76 l were used as the fermenters the activated sludge suspension from the mbr tank was circulated at a predetermined rate e g 1 6 l d through the fermenters for p extraction and recovery from the sludge during the anaerobic fermentation the sludge underwent hydrolysis and acidogenesis releasing orthophosphate po4 p into the supernatant the sludge with a reduced p content was returned to the mbr orthophosphate in the supernatant was precipitated with ferrous iron at ph 8 followed by sedimentation for recovery to enhance the sludge acidogenesis and the resulting p release cooked rice as a model food waste was added into the sludge fermenter for co fermentation the rice consisted of around 83 4 carbohydrates 12 8 proteins and 3 8 other components on the basis of dry weight with an overall ratio of 1 05 g chemical oxygen demand cod per gram of suspended solids ss the cooked rice was crushed with an electric blender and mixed well with the sludge in the fermenters two fermenters were used to receive the mbr sludge on alternate days every day 1 6 l of mbr sludge i e 20 of the sludge mixture in the mbr tank was withdrawn and added into a fermenter to mix with 160 ml of the suspension that consisted of the residual seed sludge and the slurry of cooked rice with an organic content of 3 5 g cod or 2 0 g cod l the sludge was mixed by magnetic stirring in the fermenters at room temperature after 48 h fermentation 160 ml of the sludge mixture was kept in the fermenter as seed and the remaining sludge suspension was withdrawn after 30 min sedimentation 1 l supernatant was collected and processed for p recovery for the remaining sludge sediment 500 ml was returned to the mbr tank and 100 ml was discharged as the waste sludge from the system to precipitate p in the supernatant the ph of the solution was adjusted to 8 by adding 2 m naoh after stirring for 30 min precipitates were formed and the mixture was centrifuged for 1 min to obtain the precipitates the solids were dried and analysed for the p content and overall p recovery efficiency 2 3 continuous p removal and recovery experiment the experiments on p removal and recovery from municipal wastewater were carried out continuously at room temperature 25 c for about 200 days treating actual sewage collected from sstw the mbr was first operated and stabilised for wastewater treatment without dosing with fecl3 coagulant the mbr based experiment was then conducted in three phases with fecl3 dosing the typical process conditions are given in table 1 in phase i 60 d the ferric coagulant dose increased from 0 to 10 and 15 mg fe l into the wastewater influent the duration for each iron dosage was 20 days and the p removal result by the aerobic mbr was evaluated in phase ii 60 d the fe dosage was maintained at 20 mg l for continuous wastewater treatment during these two phases sludge fermentation and p extraction from the mbr sludge were not performed and p accumulation in mbr was observed in phase iii 70 d a side stream fermentation process was included and operated for the mbr sludge the sludge was withdrawn at a predetermined rate and underwent fermentation and acidogenesis to facilitate the release of p into the supernatant the sludge was then returned to the mbr whilst p in the supernatant was precipitated for p removal during all the experimental phases the wastewater influent effluent and the mbr sludge were sampled every 2 d to determine the concentrations of soluble orthophosphate sp total phosphorous tp total nitrogen tn cod ss and volatile ss vss in phase iii the anaerobic supernatant and sludge were also sampled every 2 d for measurement of the sp tp cod volatile fatty acids vfas ss vss soluble fe ii sfe ii and total fe tfe concentrations 2 4 batch experiment on sludge acidogenesis for p release and recovery batch experiments were also conducted on mbr sludge fermentation to investigate the effects of organic loading and fermentation period on sludge acidogenesis and p release the p rich sludge mixture was withdrawn from the mbr on day 80 during its stable operation the sludge was placed in glass bottles for batch fermentation and each contained 1 l mbr sludge and 100 ml seed sludge from the side stream fermenters described above the rice addition was tested for co fermentation at four different loading rates of 0 1 2 and 4 g cod l in the fermenters corresponding to sludge loadings of 0 0 26 0 53 and 1 05 g cod g ss respectively the sludge was mixed by magnetic stirring during fermentation for 72 h at room temperature the supernatant was sampled every 12 h to determine the ph vfas sp and sfe ii the fe and p species in the sludge mixture before and after fermentation was also analysed to investigate fe and p transformation during the process 2 5 batch acidification experiment a chemical acidification experiment was also conducted on the mbr sludge for p extraction the test was conducted in comparison to anaerobic acidogenesis for the release of p and fe from the sludge into the supernatant for the batch acidification test ten reactors containing 100 ml mbr sludge each were adjusted by adding hcl to different ph levels i e 1 0 1 3 1 5 2 3 3 1 3 8 4 6 5 2 6 0 and 6 5 the sludge mixtures were then stirred for 1 h for chemical release under the acidic condition the supernatants were then sampled to measure the sp sfe ii and tfe concentrations 2 6 mass balance analysis mass balance analysis was performed for p through the mbr and sludge fermentation process the mass balance at steady state was established based on the material transformation and mass flow chart shown in figure s1 supplementary material the performance related equations are given below whilst the details of the mass balance for p flow and transformation are presented in supplementary material some key parameters are briefly defined as follows r 1 the removal efficiency of tp by the mbr with fe based chemical dosing 1 r 1 1 c p o u t c p i n r s the recirculation ratio of the mbr sludge through the side stream fermentation 2 r s q s q in r l the fraction of the supernatant collected from the fermented sludge 3 r l q l q s r p the efficiency of p release from the sludge into supernatant during fermentation 4 r p c p l c p 2 where c p in and c p out are the tp concentrations in the wastewater influent and effluent of the mbr respectively q in is the flowrate of the wastewater influent q s is the flowrate of the mbr sludge mixture into the side stream fermentation q l is the flowrate of the supernatant of the fermented sludge c p 2 is the tp concentration in the mbr sludge mixture and c p l is the tp concentration in the supernatant of the fermented sludge then the fraction of p remaining in the effluent is 5 f p o u t 1 r 1 the overall efficiency of p recovery from the wastewater influent can be calculated as 6 f p r r 1 1 1 r l r p 1 θ θ c r s which is greatly affected by r p as well as r l r s θ and θ c where θ is the hrt of the mbr and θ c is the srt of the sludge in the mbr accordingly the fraction of p lost in the waste sludge is 7 f p w 1 f p r f p o u t 2 7 analytical methods the concentrations of cod tn sp tp sfe ii tfe ss and vss were determined according to standard methods apha 1998 cod was measured by the closed reflux titrimetric method sp and tp were measured following the ascorbic acid reduction method fe2 was determined by the phenanthroline method and tn was determined by the ultraviolet spectrophotometric screening method after persulfate digestion for determination of soluble chemical concentrations in the supernatants the sludge mixture samples were filtered with a 0 45 μm syringe pvdf membrane millipore before analysis the solution ph was measured with a ph meter starter 2100 ohaus the dissolved oxygen do concentration was measured with a digital do meter hi 2030 hanna the solution oxidation reduction potential orp was measured with an orp meter hi 98201 hanna the p content in sludge samples was fractionated and quantified following the extraction and measurement method described by uhlmann et al 1990 in which different p species

fe ii and fe iii i e tfe ii and tfe iii respectively and soluble fe ii and fe iii i e sfe ii and sfe iii respectively details of the fractionation and measurement methods are provided in supplementary material the insoluble fe ii and fe iii fractions i e ife ii and ife iii were then determined from the difference between the total and soluble fractions vfas formed in the fermented sludge were detected by gas chromatography gc agilent 6890 equipped with a capillary column agilent 19095f 123 and a flame ionization detector the sample was diluted with formic acid at a 1 1 v v ratio and 1 ml of the diluted sample was injected into the gc inlet in the split mode at an initial temperature of 200 c with the helium gas flow at 3 8 ml min the vaporised sample passed through the capillary column the gc oven was initialised at 70 c for 3 min increased by 10 c per minute to 180 c and held there for 4 5 min the flame ionization detector was prepared at 250 c for the detection and quantification of vfas the detected vfas included acetic propionic butyric isobutyric valeric isovaleric isocaproic caproic and hexanoic acids the total vfa concentration was calculated as the sum of these short chain fatty acids the recovered p containing precipitates were characterized by x ray powder diffraction xrd and energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds the precipitate samples were vacuum freeze dried for 24 h before analysis the xrd pattern was determined by a d8 advanced diffractometer bruker axs with a lynxeye detector the 2θ scan range was from 5 to 80 and the xrd analysis was performed using the topas 4 2 software bruker axs gmbh germany the eds was performed with a hitachi s4800 fef scanning electron microscopy sem japan 3 results and discussion 3 1 p removal from wastewater by chemical flocculation and mbr the mbr performed as well as expected in organic degradation and removal for municipal wastewater treatment fig 2 the cod removal efficiency was generally over 95 with an effluent cod of lower than 5 mg l however the p removal performance was greatly affected by the fecl3 dosing rate during the mbr treatment tests in phase i without fe addition 0 20 d the average tp removal efficiency by the mbr was only 39 6 which is attributed to apparent consumption by microbial growths and membrane filtration of particulate p with the fe dosing and prior flocculation the p removal performance improved significantly the fe iii based precipitation and adsorption are believed to be the main mechanisms for enhanced p removal wu et al 2015 the average tp removal efficiencies for the fe doses of 10 15 and 20 mg l were 70 6 87 7 and 96 4 respectively the molar ratio of fe p is known as the key influencing factor in chemically enhanced p removal and is usually considerably higher than predicted by the fepo4 stoichiometry thistleton et al 2002 in this study the fe dose of 20 mg l corresponded to an fe p molar ratio of about 2 1 resulting in an overall p removal efficiency as high as 96 4 under this fe dosing condition the effluent tp was constantly below 0 5 mg l with an average of only 0 19 mg l thus dosing of fecl3 at 20 mg fe l was applied for the subsequent experiments on p removal and recovery throughout phases ii and iii chemical precipitation and flocculation together with mbr was shown to be simple in operation and highly reliable for p removal as reported by others for the similar process zhang et al 2015 although pre flocculation by fecl3 greatly increased the p removal the chemical dosing had no apparent effect on the organic degradation and removal by the mbr treatment fig 2 the dosing of flocculant fecl3 might be also beneficial to membrane filtration in the mbr operation according to the tmp record for the long term experiment shown in figure s2 supplementary material membrane fouling occurred rather rapidly in phase i without the chemical dosing 0 20 d and with a low iron dose 21 40 d as the tmp increased to over 30 kpa within only 3 d with an increasing iron dose the period of mbr operation without membrane fouling was extended by dosing ferric iron at 20 mg l phases ii iii the membrane fouling rate was much reduced and it took 7 8 d for the tmp to reach 30 kpa before membrane cleansing the comparison suggests that fe based pre flocculation with a sufficient iron dosing can help mitigate the fouling problem in the mbr the results are consistent with other experimental findings that use ferric iron flocculants in mbr operation song et al 2008 zhang et al 2015 sub micro particles and soluble microbial products smps are known as the main foulants in mbr sludge with the fecl3 addition the hydrous ferric oxides would be quickly formed with a highly reactive surface particulate matter and smp could be easily adsorbed onto the binding sites on the surface of hydrous ferric oxides to form fe particle smp complex this would help reduce the fouling propensity of the sludge and hence alleviate the membrane fouling problem wang et al 2014 wu et al 2006 however it should be pointed out that when p in wastewater was precipitated with fe for enhanced p removal the fe p solids accumulated with the activated sludge in the mbr an increasing tp content in mbr sludge was observed in phases i and ii at the end of phase ii the tp concentration increased to more than 200 mg l in the mbr and the vss ss ratio of the sludge decreased to about 0 6 inorganic solids became a significant fraction in the sludge which continued to increase in the mbr with a long srt this inactive solid content and the reduced biomass fraction would affect the bioactivity of activated sludge in the mbr fan et al 2015 on the other hand the p accumulation in the mbr sludge could allow for p recovery from the sludge as shown in fig 1 an anaerobic reactor was coupled with the mbr for sludge fermentation to help consistently extract p and fe from the mbr sludge 3 2 sludge fermentation and p recovery the mbr sludge was processed by anaerobic fermentation for extraction and removal of p and fe from the solid phase of the sludge before it was returned to the mbr this side stream sludge fermentation process would also allow p recovery from the supernatant in the following experimental studies batch co fermentation of the sludge with model food waste was conducted the influential factors were tested the fermentation process was optimised and the long term performance of the system was evaluated 3 2 1 batch fermentation and p recovery anaerobic sludge digestion usually consists of organic hydrolysis acidogenesis and methanogenesis with a proper loading duration or ph control the digestion can be controlled at the acidogenesis level with no methane production as shown in fig 3 sludge acidogenesis was well achieved by co fermentation with the food waste during the acidogenic fermentation particulate organics in the sludge were hydrolysed into soluble organics that were then converted into vfas in the solution the vfa concentrations greatly increased in the first 48 h with the vfa production the ph of the sludge mixture decreased significantly to 5 0 or lower which also inhibited the methanogenesis process without the food waste addition acidogenesis of the mbr sludge was limited with little ph drop and vfa yield an increase in food waste load for the co fermentation would result in a lower ph and more vfa production the main species of vfas included acetic acid propionic acid and butyric acid figure s3 supplementary material during the fermentation fe iii in the mbr sludge was effectively reduced to fe ii by iron reducing microorganisms irm under the anaerobic condition fig 3 for which the do and orp were as low as 0 mg l and 80 mv respectively according to the fe species analysis about 6 2 of the total fe was in the form of fe ii in the mbr sludge fig 4 after co fermentation with a food waste cod load of 2 g l fe iii was effectively reduced to fe ii figure s4 supplementary material after 48 h 79 7 of the total fe was turned to fe ii the fe iii based complex was thus transformed to fe ii complex in the sludge fe ii compounds are known to have a much higher solubility than fe iii compounds the solubility of fe3 po4 2 at ph 5 0 is for example around 1 00 mmol l while for fepo4 it is only 0 01 mmol l stumm and morgan 2012 thus fe ii and p would dissolve from the mbr sludge into the supernatant during the sludge fermentation and acidogenesis as shown in fig 3 ph was rapidly decreased to the minimal level after the first 24 h which would make iron reduction the limiting factor to the release of fe and p in the early phase of fermentation along with the ph drop and iron reduction the sfe ii and sp concentrations increased significantly in the first 48 h for the food waste additions of 2 and 4 g cod l about 38 8 and 54 0 of p in the mbr sludge was released into the supernatant respectively during the batch tests the p release ratio thus increased by only 15 as the food waste loading doubled from 2 to 4 g cod l the initial food waste addition of 2 g cod l was therefore selected for the long term experimental operation re precipitation was applied on the supernatant of the fermented sludge for p recovery fig 1 after ph adjustment to 8 0 by naoh more than 99 1 of sp in the solution was readily precipitated with sfe ii to form fe ii p solids the xrd fig 5 and eds table s2 results indicate that the main fraction of the recovered precipitates was vivianite fe3 po4 2 8h2o in the remaining supernatant the vfa concentrations were not affected by the ph adjustment and solid separation vfas in the supernatant are valuable organic resources that can be used as the carbon source for denitrification in the main stream wastewater treatment or for biosynthesis of polyhydroxybutyrate phb or other value added products frison et al 2015 guo et al 2015 3 2 2 long term performance of sludge fermentation for p extraction and recovery sludge co fermentation was operated in connection to the mbr in phase iii fig 6 the fermenters started up rapidly and the acidogenesis became rather stable after 7 d the average concentrations of scod and vfas were around 1542 and 1238 mg cod l respectively after the sludge fermentation whilst the solution ph was maintained between 4 5 and 5 0 under this ph condition the average sp concentration in the supernatant could reach 53 8 mg l for p recovery the dissolution of inorganics mainly fe and p from the mbr sludge into the supernatant considerably reduced the accumulation of inorganic solids in the mbr compared to the sludge at the end of phase ii the average vss ss ratio increased from 0 6 to about 0 8 in the mbr for a srt of 30 d the decrease of inorganic contents in the sludge mixture would benefit biological wastewater treatment by the mbr overall simple chemical flocculation followed by mbr can effectively remove p in wastewater treatment co fermentation of the mbr sludge in the side stream fermenters would not only extract p and fe from the sludge for p recovery but would also help solve the problem of inorganic build up in the mbr system meanwhile the side stream sludge fermentation had no obvious effect on the performance of the mbr in organic degradation and removal fig 2 3 3 mass balance analysis mass balance analysis was performed on the transformation of p and fe throughout the chemical precipitation and mbr treatment acidogenic fermentation and recovery process the overall material flow and mass balance results for the period of phase iii are summarised in fig 7 on average about 96 4 of tp in the wastewater influent was retained in the mbr by the chemical precipitation and ceramic membrane filtration resulting in a tp concentration of about 121 mg l in the mbr sludge during the sludge acidogenesis p in the mbr sludge fed into the fermenters was released as sp to an average concentration of 53 8 mg l into the liquid phase which was readily recovered from the supernatant as vivianite by chemical precipitation the average p release ratio cp soluble cp total in the long term operation was about 0 44 the resulting overall efficiency of tp recovery from the wastewater influent reached up to 62 1 whilst about 27 3 of the tp was discharged with the waste sludge in the experimental study the sludge had a srt of about 30 d in the mbr and 20 of the mbr sludge was circulated each day though the fermenter as a result the same sludge mass would have passed through the fermenter not once but several times before discharge with the repeated sludge circulation for p release the overall p recovery ratio from wastewater 62 1 for the whole experimental system was considerably higher than the one time p release ratio 44 4 in the anaerobic fermenter however it should be noted that the sums of the p and fe amounts in the discharging flows including the effluent sludge supernatant and waste sludge are less than 100 of the inputs of p 93 and fe 91 errors would be involved in sludge sampling and chemical analysis in addition p and fe might be lost to the sludge attached to the membrane surface that was washed off periodically from the membrane module these amounts of p and fe were not quantified in the study which would result in the low estimations of p and fe for the mass balance analysis the operating condition of the p removal and recovery system and p related material flow are summarised in table 1 according to the mass balance as given in eq 6 the overall p recovery was affected by a number of factors including the p removal efficiency by the aerobic mbr r 1 the daily mbr sludge recirculation ratio for fermentation r s the ratio of supernatant collected from the fermented sludge r l the p release efficiency during the acidogenic fermentation r p the hrt θ and the srt θ c the p removal efficiency r 1 by the mbr could reach 96 for an fe dosage of 20 mg l the daily mbr sludge recirculation ratio r s was set at 10 for fermentation and the ratio of supernatant from the fermented sludge r l was kept at 0 625 given these conditions the ratio of p release from sludge r p after 48 h of batch fermentation was 0 44 for a food waste cod loading of 2 g l by applying those values into the mass balance equations the simulated proportions of p in the effluent recovered precipitates and disposal sludge were 3 9 66 7 and 29 4 respectively these values are similar to the experimental data of 3 6 62 1 and 27 3 respectively the mass balance equations can be a useful tool for predicting the p flow transformation and recovery throughout this mbr sludge acidogenesis system the simulation results suggest that the mbr sludge recirculation rate and the fraction of supernatant after sludge fermentation were important to the overall p recovery efficiency a higher sludge recirculation ratio and a higher fraction of supernatant withdrawn from the fermented sludge would considerably increase the p recovery efficiency nonetheless the ratio of p release from the mbr sludge during fermentation was the crucial factor for the p recovery efficiency the p release ratio was affected by the anaerobic fermentation conditions including the organic loading fermentation period and solution ph according to batch tests a high organic loading rate long fermentation time and low ph value would facilitate the p release from the mbr sludge moreover srt had a great impact on the p recovery potential and a longer srt for the mbr with less sludge discharge would help increase the overall p recovery efficiency for instance if the srt increased from 30 to 90 d in the test system while the other factors remained the same according to eq 6 the p recovery efficiency would be increased from 66 7 to 83 7 in fact a long srt is known to be one of the advantages for mbr wu et al 2017 the side stream sludge fermentation for p and fe extractions would allow a longer srt without the problem of p and inorganic accumulations in the mbr tanks 3 4 comparison of acidification and acidogenesis extraction of p from the mbr sludge by chemical acidification was also conducted in comparison with the result of anaerobic acidogenesis for chemical acidification by dosing hcl the release of fe and p increased as the solution ph decreased and the release became significant as the ph dropped to below 2 0 fig 8 the observed release of fe and p from the mbr sludge by acidification resulted from the chemical desorption and dissolution and the main species of fe dissolved was fe iii when the ph dropped to 1 0 63 7 of the total p and 94 4 of the total fe were released from the sludge into the supernatant in comparison the fe and p released from the sludge could occur under a much milder condition through acidogenic sludge fermentation with the dissimilatory iron reduction more than 80 of the total fe was present as fe ii in the fermented sludge fig 4 for a ph of around 4 0 during fermentation 54 7 of total p and 76 7 of total fe could be released from the mbr sludge unlike in chemical acidification anaerobic acidogenesis induced p release from the sludge without the use of strong acids the low ph acidification condition could dissolve many other chemicals from the sludge such as ca mg al and heavy metals into the supernatant which might affect the effectiveness and quality of p recovery by precipitation more importantly unlike acidogenic fermentation the sludge after the strong chemical acidification would be largely deactivated and destroyed and thus could not be returned to the mbr for biological wastewater treatment 3 5 mechanisms for the p removal and recovery 3 5 1 chemically enhanced p removal the main pathways for p removal and recovery in this new mbr sludge acidogenesis system are illustrated in fig 9 in the aerobic mbr tank a portion of phosphate was converted to organic p through biosynthesis which accounted for only a small fraction for total p removal lee et al 2008 with the chemical dosing most p in wastewater was precipitated by fecl3 or adsorbed by ferric iron oxides to form a fe iii p complex which may be simplified as follows 8 f e 3 p o 4 3 h 2 o f e i i i p s the p species analysis result shows that p was bound mainly to iron oxides in the mbr sludge which accounted for about 60 of tp in the mbr fig 4 wu et al 2015 fe po4 mineral was also detected in mbr sludge which accounted for around 6 of the tp removed however the chemical extraction method used for speciation analysis has shortcomings in efficiency and accuracy besides the chemical species may be changed during the chemical treatment at each extraction step more powerful detection techniques such as x ray absorption spectroscopy xas and nuclear magnetic resonance nmr can be applied for more reliable and accurate analysis according to the xas detection by wu et al 2015 the main p species in mbr sludge included distinct fe po4 mineral and po4 3 adsorbed to the iron oxyhydroxide mineral phase feooh the strong bonding between p and the fe iii complex improved the removal performance and retained most of p in the mbr wilfert et al 2015 3 5 2 acidogenic co fermentation for p release and recovery in the side stream sludge fermentation p was extracted and released in the form of orthophosphate into the supernatant through biological acidogenesis and dissimilatory iron reduction which can be described as follows 9 f e i i i p s c h 2 o f e 2 p o 4 3 c o 2 h 2 o microorganisms used organics to produce vfas and hence lowered the solution ph they also played a significant role in mediating fe oxidation and reduction reactions weber et al 2006 more specifically fe iii can act as elector acceptors in microbial metabolism to provide energy for cell growth under an anaerobic condition the possible metabolisms are as follows i fermentative metabolism fe iii is reduced in digestion of monomers such as sugars and amino acids lovley 1991 10 24 f e i i i c 6 h 12 o 6 6 h 2 o 24 f e i i 6 c o 2 24 h ii hydrogen oxidation fe iii is reduced by hydrogen in an anaerobic environment lovley and goodwin 1988 11 f e i i i h 2 f e i i 2 h iii organic acid oxidation the oxidation of organic acids especially acetate is coupled with the reduction of fe iii finke et al 2007 12 8 f e i i i c h 3 c o o h 2 h 2 o 8 f e i i c o 2 8 h in the present study after chemical precipitation fe iii accumulated in the mbr sludge sufficient electron donors were required to achieve effective iron reduction with the food waste addition for co fermentation vfas were produced and fe iii was reduced to fe ii in the fermenter the large amount of vfas suggests that organic acid oxidation would be the main metabolism contributing to the reduction of fe iii the fe iii based complex was then transformed into fe ii based including the transformations of fe iii po4 mineral to fe ii po4 and feooh or fe oh 3 to fe oh 2 these fe ii based compounds are much more soluble than their fe iii based counterparts under a weak acid condition ph 5 the adsorption bonding between p and ferrous ion oxides is also less stable than that between p and ferric iron oxides de best et al 1995 the fe ii p complex thus dissolved and released ferrous ion and orthophosphate into the supernatant for the batch sludge fermentation with a 4 g cod l food waste addition as shown in fig 4a the fraction of iron oxides p reduced significantly from 61 8 to 13 7 and the soluble p increased from 0 1 to 54 0 during the chemical precipitation for p recovery from the supernatant of the fermented sludge after the adjustment of the solution ph to 8 sfe ii and sp precipitated together as follows to form vivianite 13 f e

municipal wastewater treatment was developed which included ferric iron dosing and flocculation an aerobic mbr and side stream acidogenic sludge fermentation the sludge from the mbr was circulated through the side stream fermenters for fe and p dissolution and extraction by co fermentation with a model food waste 2 g cod l for 2 d the mbr sludge underwent acidogenesis and dissimilatory iron reduction leading to a ph decrease to below 5 0 and effective reduction of fe iii to fe ii with a much increased solubility of the fe ii based than fe iii based compounds about 44 4 of p and 45 9 of fe were then released from the sludge into the supernatant an overall p recovery of 62 1 from the wastewater can be achieved in the form of vivianite and the inorganic build up problem in the mbr can be alleviated compared to chemical acidification for p extraction from sludge co fermentation allows effective p recovery without using strong acids also acidogenesis does not inactivate biomass so the fermented sludge is returned to the mbr to maintain its long srt the research presents an innovative environmentally friendly chemical biological process for enhanced p removal and recovery during the course of wastewater treatment mass balance was well established to help understand the p flow and transformation through the different stages of the process and to evaluate the influences of

19854,a novel phosphorous p removal and recovery process using a membrane bioreactor mbr with ferric iron dosing and acidogenic co fermentation was developed for municipal wastewater treatment the very different solubility of fe iii p and fe ii p complex and the microbial transformation of fe iii to fe ii were utilized for p removal and recovery by means of fe induced precipitation chemical p removal was effectively achieved by an mbr with a flat plate ceramic membrane however the fe iii p solids accumulated in the mbr that constituted a significant fraction of the activated sludge anaerobic co fermentation of the mbr sludge and food waste in a side stream allowed the extraction of p and fe from the sludge into the supernatant the p in the supernatant was recovered as a fertilizer resource while the sludge was returned to the mbr tank the experimental results show that by adding fecl3 at 20 mg fe l into the influent of domestic wastewater about 95 6 of total p could be removed by the mbr one fifth 20 of the sludge in the mbr was circulated daily through the side stream fermenters for co fermentation with cooked rice as the model food waste the sludge underwent acidogenesis and dissimilatory iron reduction resulting in a drop of the ph to below 5 0 and reduction of fe iii to fe ii owing to the high solubility of the fe ii p complex p and fe were then dissolved and released from the sludge into the supernatant by simply adjusting the solution ph to 8 0 the p and fe ii in the supernatant readily re precipitated to form vivianite for the p recovery using the iron dosing mbr and side stream sludge fermentation an overall p recovery efficiency of 62 1 from wastewater influent can be achieved and the problem of inorganic build up in the mbr is effectively alleviated graphical abstract image 1 keywords membrane bioreactor chemical phosphorus removal phosphorus recovery acidogenesis dissimilatory iron reduction vivianite 1 introduction phosphorus p is one of main nutrients in wastewater that cause eutrophication and related water pollution problems in wastewater treatment p can be removed by processes such as enhanced biological p removal ebpr and chemical precipitation ebpr removes p through luxury uptake by polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos in the activated sludge system sun et al 2013 however ebpr requires a delicate condition and skilful operation which often makes it difficult to achieve efficient and reliable p removal guerrero et al 2011 the chemical precipitation process is relatively simple and easy for p removal and is achieved by dosing metal fe or al salts as coagulants into wastewater to form p incorporated solids within the waste sludge limited chemical dosing can help reduce the total phosphorus tp concentration to below 0 5 mg l in the effluent yang et al 2011 zhang et al 2015 whilst p is a significant water pollutant it is also an irreplaceable and non renewable resource that supports global food security around 20 million tons mt of p are mined globally every year cordell et al 2011 the demand for p continues to increase because of growing population and food consumption which may lead to depletion of the global p rock reserves by the end of this century every year about 3 mt of p is lost as human waste and about 1 3 mt p is treated in municipal wastewater treatment plants worldwide van vuuren et al 2010 it has been estimated that recovery of p from wastewater would satisfy 15 20 of global demand for p cordell et al 2009 and increasing efforts are made to drive forward p recovery recently a new sewage sludge ordinance passed by the german cabinet will make p recovery from sewage sludge obligatory for all large german wastewater treatment plants bmub 2017 currently most technologies for p recovery are focused on waste sludge or sludge ash desmidt et al 2015 egle et al 2015 and acidification is commonly applied to extract p from the sludge mayer et al 2016 however those chemical methods use large amounts of strong acids petzet et al 2012 and the residual sludge requires further neutralisation and treatment before disposal the operating difficulties and high costs involved hinder the actual application of the chemical extraction process for p recovery from wastewater sartorius et al 2012 membrane bioreactor mbr is a new generation of wastewater treatment technology that has been increasingly applied in recent years mbrs are able to achieve complete solid liquid separation and a long sludge retention time srt thereby greatly increasing the biomass concentration and diversity and reducing the sludge yield in the bioreactors judd 2010 the mbr configuration continues to evolve for more versatile and cost effective applications new materials such as ceramic membranes have also been adopted in mbrs owing to their long durability low fouling propensity and resistance to chemical cleaning li et al 2011 with chemical precipitation mbrs can be effectively used for p removal in wastewater treatment liu et al 2011 simple addition of fe coagulant into mbrs can consistently remove p from the effluent and help mitigate the membrane fouling problem yang et al 2011 however chemical precipitation and membrane filtration result in a significant accumulation of inorganic precipitates in the sludge of the mbrs the vss ss ratio of the mbr sludge was found to decrease from 75 to 64 after a 30 d operation with fe based chemical dosing and that ratio would continue to decrease under the long srt 30 60 d condition do et al 2012 the accumulation of inactive sludge in the mbr lowers the biomass content and affects the sludge bioactivity for wastewater treatment fan et al 2015 thus the p and fe contents should constantly be removed from the mbr sludge suspension without affecting the biomass concentration and srt the p extracted from the mbr sludge also can be recovered as a valuable resource in fact wilfert et al 2016 suggested a new route of p recovery from iron dosing sludge by forming vivianite based on the redox state of iron in this study a novel integration of the mbr with the sludge fermentation was developed for effective p removal and recovery in municipal wastewater treatment the process makes use of an aerobic mbr tank with fe dosing to achieve enhanced p removal and side stream acidogenic co fermentation to extract p from the mbr sludge for recovery unlike chemical acidification biological acidogenesis can lower the sludge ph for p extraction without deactivating the biomass dissimilatory iron reduction during the anaerobic sludge fermentation led to p release into the liquid phase of the sludge in addition food waste was added for co fermentation and sludge acidogenesis kim et al 2016 after p release and recovery the activated sludge was returned to the aerobic mbr tank for wastewater treatment long term experimental study was conducted the performance of the new process for p removal and recovery was evaluated and p and fe transformation during the process was investigated and modelled 2 materials and methods 2 1 wastewater raw sewage was collected from a local municipal wastewater treatment plant stanley sewage treatment works sstw hong kong as the wastewater influent for the experimental study this was either used on the same day of collection or preserved in a refrigerator at 4 c for less than 1 week to prevent changes in quality the main water quality parameters of the wastewater influent recorded for the different experimental phases are summarised in table 1 2 2 experimental set up an integrated system with an mbr and its side stream sludge fermentation was developed for the enhanced wastewater treatment and p recovery fig 1 the aerobic mbr tank was made of plexiglass with an inner dimension of 200 150 400 mm length width height and a working volume of about 8 l a flat plate ceramic membrane module with an average pore size of 100 nm meidensha corporation japan was vertically submerged in the membrane tank the membrane plate had a dimension of 240 80 5 9 mm length width thickness and an effective surface area of 0 0384 m2 the mbr tank was filled with activated sludge for biological wastewater treatment with a mixed liquor suspended solids concentration kept within a range of 4 0 5 5 g l for treatment by the mbr the wastewater influent was pre flocculated by fecl3 at a dosage of 20 mg fe l and the mixture without sedimentation was pumped into the mbr tank fe iii based chemical dosing was applied to induce precipitation and flocculation for enhanced p removal and a low p concentration in the effluent zhang et al 2015 effluent from the mbr was withdrawn through the ceramic membrane by a suction pump master flex cole parmer aiming at a constant flow rate of 16 6 l d corresponding to a hydraulic retention time hrt of 12 h and a flux of 17 4 l h m2 lhm the effluent suction pump was controlled by a programmable logic controller for 5 h 55 min on and 5 min off in each operation cycle 4 cycles d when the suction pump was off the membrane module was backwashed with the treated effluent for 5 min at a flux of 46 9 lhm the transmembrane pressure tmp was recorded during the mbr operation when it exceeded 30 kpa the membrane module was removed and washed with running tap water to remove the foulants from the membrane surface and restore its permeability periodically e g once every one month the ceramic membrane was chemically washed by chemical washing the membrane was backwashed with 600 ml 0 1 m naoh 20 ml min followed by 600 ml 0 1 m hcl 20 ml min and then 600 ml tap water 20 ml min anaerobic reactors were operated for sludge fermentation in a side stream mode coupling with the mbr fig 1 glass bottles 1 76 l were used as the fermenters the activated sludge suspension from the mbr tank was circulated at a predetermined rate e g 1 6 l d through the fermenters for p extraction and recovery from the sludge during the anaerobic fermentation the sludge underwent hydrolysis and acidogenesis releasing orthophosphate po4 p into the supernatant the sludge with a reduced p content was returned to the mbr orthophosphate in the supernatant was precipitated with ferrous iron at ph 8 followed by sedimentation for recovery to enhance the sludge acidogenesis and the resulting p release cooked rice as a model food waste was added into the sludge fermenter for co fermentation the rice consisted of around 83 4 carbohydrates 12 8 proteins and 3 8 other components on the basis of dry weight with an overall ratio of 1 05 g chemical oxygen demand cod per gram of suspended solids ss the cooked rice was crushed with an electric blender and mixed well with the sludge in the fermenters two fermenters were used to receive the mbr sludge on alternate days every day 1 6 l of mbr sludge i e 20 of the sludge mixture in the mbr tank was withdrawn and added into a fermenter to mix with 160 ml of the suspension that consisted of the residual seed sludge and the slurry of cooked rice with an organic content of 3 5 g cod or 2 0 g cod l the sludge was mixed by magnetic stirring in the fermenters at room temperature after 48 h fermentation 160 ml of the sludge mixture was kept in the fermenter as seed and the remaining sludge suspension was withdrawn after 30 min sedimentation 1 l supernatant was collected and processed for p recovery for the remaining sludge sediment 500 ml was returned to the mbr tank and 100 ml was discharged as the waste sludge from the system to precipitate p in the supernatant the ph of the solution was adjusted to 8 by adding 2 m naoh after stirring for 30 min precipitates were formed and the mixture was centrifuged for 1 min to obtain the precipitates the solids were dried and analysed for the p content and overall p recovery efficiency 2 3 continuous p removal and recovery experiment the experiments on p removal and recovery from municipal wastewater were carried out continuously at room temperature 25 c for about 200 days treating actual sewage collected from sstw the mbr was first operated and stabilised for wastewater treatment without dosing with fecl3 coagulant the mbr based experiment was then conducted in three phases with fecl3 dosing the typical process conditions are given in table 1 in phase i 60 d the ferric coagulant dose increased from 0 to 10 and 15 mg fe l into the wastewater influent the duration for each iron dosage was 20 days and the p removal result by the aerobic mbr was evaluated in phase ii 60 d the fe dosage was maintained at 20 mg l for continuous wastewater treatment during these two phases sludge fermentation and p extraction from the mbr sludge were not performed and p accumulation in mbr was observed in phase iii 70 d a side stream fermentation process was included and operated for the mbr sludge the sludge was withdrawn at a predetermined rate and underwent fermentation and acidogenesis to facilitate the release of p into the supernatant the sludge was then returned to the mbr whilst p in the supernatant was precipitated for p removal during all the experimental phases the wastewater influent effluent and the mbr sludge were sampled every 2 d to determine the concentrations of soluble orthophosphate sp total phosphorous tp total nitrogen tn cod ss and volatile ss vss in phase iii the anaerobic supernatant and sludge were also sampled every 2 d for measurement of the sp tp cod volatile fatty acids vfas ss vss soluble fe ii sfe ii and total fe tfe concentrations 2 4 batch experiment on sludge acidogenesis for p release and recovery batch experiments were also conducted on mbr sludge fermentation to investigate the effects of organic loading and fermentation period on sludge acidogenesis and p release the p rich sludge mixture was withdrawn from the mbr on day 80 during its stable operation the sludge was placed in glass bottles for batch fermentation and each contained 1 l mbr sludge and 100 ml seed sludge from the side stream fermenters described above the rice addition was tested for co fermentation at four different loading rates of 0 1 2 and 4 g cod l in the fermenters corresponding to sludge loadings of 0 0 26 0 53 and 1 05 g cod g ss respectively the sludge was mixed by magnetic stirring during fermentation for 72 h at room temperature the supernatant was sampled every 12 h to determine the ph vfas sp and sfe ii the fe and p species in the sludge mixture before and after fermentation was also analysed to investigate fe and p transformation during the process 2 5 batch acidification experiment a chemical acidification experiment was also conducted on the mbr sludge for p extraction the test was conducted in comparison to anaerobic acidogenesis for the release of p and fe from the sludge into the supernatant for the batch acidification test ten reactors containing 100 ml mbr sludge each were adjusted by adding hcl to different ph levels i e 1 0 1 3 1 5 2 3 3 1 3 8 4 6 5 2 6 0 and 6 5 the sludge mixtures were then stirred for 1 h for chemical release under the acidic condition the supernatants were then sampled to measure the sp sfe ii and tfe concentrations 2 6 mass balance analysis mass balance analysis was performed for p through the mbr and sludge fermentation process the mass balance at steady state was established based on the material transformation and mass flow chart shown in figure s1 supplementary material the performance related equations are given below whilst the details of the mass balance for p flow and transformation are presented in supplementary material some key parameters are briefly defined as follows r 1 the removal efficiency of tp by the mbr with fe based chemical dosing 1 r 1

fermented sludge c p 2 is the tp concentration in the mbr sludge mixture and c p l is the tp concentration in the supernatant of the fermented sludge then the fraction of p remaining in the effluent is 5 f p o u t 1 r 1 the overall efficiency of p recovery from the wastewater influent can be calculated as 6 f p r r 1 1 1 r l r p 1 θ θ c r s which is greatly affected by r p as well as r l r s θ and θ c where θ is the hrt of the mbr and θ c is the srt of the sludge in the mbr accordingly the fraction of p lost in the waste sludge is 7 f p w 1 f p r f p o u t 2 7 analytical methods the concentrations of cod tn sp tp sfe ii tfe ss and vss were determined according to standard methods apha 1998 cod was measured by the closed reflux titrimetric method sp and tp were measured following the ascorbic acid reduction method fe2 was determined by the phenanthroline method and tn was determined by the ultraviolet spectrophotometric screening method after persulfate digestion for determination of soluble chemical concentrations in the supernatants the sludge mixture samples were filtered with a 0 45 μm syringe pvdf membrane millipore before analysis the solution ph was

orp meter hi 98201 hanna the p content in sludge samples was fractionated and quantified following the extraction and measurement method described by uhlmann et al 1990 in which different p species

material the insoluble fe ii and fe iii fractions i e ife ii and ife iii were then determined from the difference between the total and soluble fractions vfas formed in the fermented sludge were detected by gas chromatography gc agilent 6890 equipped with a capillary column agilent 19095f 123 and a flame ionization detector the sample was diluted with formic acid at a 1 1 v v ratio and 1 ml of the diluted sample was injected into the gc inlet in the split mode at an initial temperature of 200 c with the helium gas flow at 3 8 ml min the vaporised sample passed through the capillary column the gc oven was initialised at 70 c for 3 min increased by 10 c per minute to 180 c and held there for 4 5 min the flame ionization detector was prepared at 250 c for the detection and quantification of vfas the detected vfas included acetic propionic butyric isobutyric valeric isovaleric isocaproic caproic and hexanoic acids the total vfa concentration was calculated as the sum of these short chain fatty acids the recovered p containing precipitates were characterized by x ray powder diffraction xrd and energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds the precipitate samples were vacuum freeze dried for 24 h before analysis the xrd pattern was determined by a d8 advanced diffractometer bruker axs with a lynxeye detector the 2θ scan range was from 5 to 80 and the xrd analysis

wastewater by chemical flocculation and mbr the mbr performed as well as expected in organic degradation and removal for municipal wastewater treatment fig 2 the cod removal efficiency was generally over 95 with an effluent cod of lower than 5 mg l however the p removal performance was greatly affected by the fecl3 dosing rate during the mbr treatment tests in phase i without fe addition 0 20 d the average tp removal efficiency by the mbr was only 39 6 which is attributed to apparent consumption by microbial growths and membrane filtration of particulate p with the fe dosing and prior flocculation the p removal performance improved significantly the fe iii based precipitation and adsorption are believed to be the main mechanisms for enhanced p removal wu et al 2015 the average tp removal efficiencies for the fe doses of 10 15 and 20 mg l were 70 6 87 7 and 96 4 respectively the molar ratio of fe p is known as the key influencing factor in chemically enhanced p removal and is usually considerably higher than predicted by the fepo4 stoichiometry thistleton et al 2002 in this study the fe dose of 20 mg l corresponded to an fe p molar ratio of about 2 1 resulting in an overall p removal efficiency as high as 96 4 under this fe dosing condition the effluent tp was constantly below 0 5 mg l with an average of only 0 19 mg l thus dosing of fecl3 at 20 mg fe l was applied for the subsequent experiments on p removal and recovery throughout phases ii and iii chemical precipitation and flocculation together with mbr was shown to be simple in operation and highly reliable for p removal as reported by others for the similar process zhang et al 2015 although pre flocculation by fecl3 greatly increased the p removal the chemical dosing had no apparent effect on the organic degradation and removal by the mbr treatment fig 2 the dosing of flocculant fecl3 might be also beneficial to membrane filtration in the mbr operation according to the tmp record for the long term experiment shown in figure s2 supplementary material membrane fouling occurred rather rapidly in phase i without the chemical dosing 0 20 d and with a low iron dose 21 40 d as the tmp increased to over 30 kpa within only 3 d with an increasing iron dose the period of mbr operation without membrane fouling was extended by dosing ferric iron at 20 mg l phases ii iii the membrane fouling rate was much reduced and it took 7 8 d for the tmp to reach 30 kpa before membrane cleansing the comparison suggests that fe based pre flocculation with a sufficient iron dosing can help mitigate the fouling problem in the mbr the results are consistent with other experimental findings that use ferric iron flocculants in mbr operation song et al 2008 zhang et al 2015 sub micro particles and soluble microbial products smps are known as the main foulants in mbr sludge with the fecl3 addition the hydrous ferric oxides would be quickly formed with a highly reactive surface particulate matter and smp could be easily adsorbed onto the binding sites on the surface of hydrous ferric oxides to form fe particle smp complex this would help reduce the fouling propensity of the sludge and hence alleviate the membrane fouling problem wang et al 2014 wu et al 2006 however it should be pointed out that when p in wastewater was precipitated with fe for enhanced p removal the fe p solids accumulated with the activated sludge in the mbr an increasing tp content in mbr sludge was observed in phases i and ii at the end of phase ii the tp concentration increased to more than 200 mg l in the mbr and the vss ss ratio of the sludge decreased to about 0 6 inorganic solids became a significant fraction in the sludge which continued to increase in the mbr with a long srt this inactive solid content and the reduced biomass fraction would affect the bioactivity of activated sludge in the mbr fan et al 2015 on the other hand the p accumulation in the mbr sludge could allow for p recovery from the sludge as shown in fig 1 an anaerobic reactor was coupled with the mbr for sludge fermentation to help consistently extract p and fe from the mbr sludge 3 2 sludge fermentation and p recovery the mbr sludge was processed by anaerobic fermentation for extraction and removal of p and fe from the solid phase of the sludge before it was returned to the mbr this side stream sludge fermentation process would also allow p recovery from the supernatant in the following experimental studies batch co fermentation of the sludge with model food waste was conducted the influential factors were tested the fermentation process was optimised and the long term performance of the system was evaluated 3 2 1 batch fermentation and p recovery anaerobic sludge digestion usually consists of organic hydrolysis acidogenesis and methanogenesis with a proper loading duration or ph control the digestion can be controlled at the acidogenesis level with no methane production as shown in fig 3 sludge acidogenesis was well achieved by co fermentation with the food waste during the acidogenic fermentation particulate organics in the sludge were hydrolysed into soluble organics that were then converted into vfas in the solution the vfa concentrations greatly increased in the first 48 h with the vfa production the ph of the sludge mixture decreased significantly to 5 0 or lower which also inhibited the methanogenesis process without the food waste addition acidogenesis of the mbr sludge was limited with little ph drop and vfa yield an increase in food waste load for the co fermentation would result in a lower ph and more vfa production the main species of vfas included acetic acid propionic acid and butyric acid figure s3 supplementary material during the fermentation fe iii in the mbr sludge was effectively reduced to fe ii by iron reducing microorganisms irm under the anaerobic condition fig 3 for which the do and orp were as low as 0 mg l and 80 mv respectively according to the fe species analysis about 6 2 of the total fe was in the form of fe ii in the mbr sludge fig 4 after co fermentation with a food waste cod load of 2 g l fe iii was effectively reduced to fe ii figure s4 supplementary material after 48 h 79 7 of the total fe was turned to fe ii the fe iii based complex was thus transformed to fe ii complex in the sludge fe ii compounds are known to have a much higher solubility than fe iii compounds the solubility of fe3 po4 2 at ph 5 0 is for example around 1 00 mmol l while for fepo4 it is only 0 01 mmol l stumm and morgan 2012 thus fe ii and p would dissolve from the mbr sludge into the supernatant during the sludge fermentation and acidogenesis as shown in fig 3 ph was rapidly decreased to the minimal level after the first 24 h which would make iron reduction the limiting factor to the release of fe and p in the early phase of fermentation along with the ph drop and iron reduction the sfe ii and sp concentrations increased significantly in the first 48 h for the food waste additions of 2 and 4 g cod l about 38 8 and 54 0 of p in the mbr sludge was released into the supernatant respectively during the batch tests the p release ratio thus increased by only 15 as the food waste loading doubled from 2 to 4 g cod l the initial food waste addition of 2 g cod l was therefore selected for the long term experimental operation re precipitation was applied on the supernatant of the fermented sludge for p recovery fig 1 after ph adjustment to 8 0 by naoh more than 99 1 of sp in the solution was readily precipitated with sfe ii to form fe ii p solids the xrd fig 5 and eds table s2 results indicate that the main fraction of the recovered precipitates was vivianite fe3 po4 2 8h2o in the remaining supernatant the vfa concentrations were not affected by the ph adjustment and solid separation vfas in the supernatant are valuable organic resources that can be used as the carbon source for denitrification in the main stream wastewater treatment or for biosynthesis of polyhydroxybutyrate phb or other value added products frison et al 2015 guo et al 2015 3 2 2 long term performance of sludge fermentation for p extraction and recovery sludge co fermentation was operated in connection to the mbr in phase iii fig 6 the fermenters started up rapidly and the acidogenesis became rather stable after 7 d the average concentrations of scod and vfas were around 1542 and 1238 mg cod l respectively after the sludge fermentation whilst the solution ph was maintained between 4 5 and 5 0 under this ph condition the average sp concentration in the supernatant could reach 53 8 mg l for p recovery the dissolution of inorganics mainly fe and p from the mbr sludge into the supernatant considerably reduced the accumulation of inorganic solids in the mbr compared to the sludge at the end of phase ii the average vss ss ratio increased from 0 6 to about 0 8 in the mbr for a srt of 30 d the decrease of inorganic contents in the sludge mixture would benefit biological wastewater treatment by the mbr overall simple chemical flocculation followed by mbr can effectively remove p in wastewater treatment co fermentation of the mbr sludge in the side stream fermenters would not only extract p and fe from the sludge for p recovery but would also help solve the problem of inorganic build up in the mbr system meanwhile the side stream sludge fermentation had no obvious effect on the performance of the mbr in organic degradation and removal fig 2 3 3 mass balance analysis mass balance analysis was performed on the transformation of p and fe throughout the chemical precipitation and mbr treatment acidogenic fermentation and recovery process the overall material flow and mass balance results for the period of phase iii are summarised in fig 7 on average about 96 4 of tp in the wastewater influent was retained in the mbr by the chemical precipitation and ceramic membrane filtration resulting in a tp concentration of about 121 mg l in the mbr sludge during the sludge acidogenesis p in the mbr sludge fed into the fermenters was released as sp to an average concentration of 53 8 mg l into the liquid phase which was readily recovered from the supernatant as vivianite by chemical precipitation the average p release ratio cp soluble cp total in the long term operation was about 0 44 the resulting overall efficiency of tp recovery from the wastewater influent reached up to 62 1 whilst about 27 3 of the tp was discharged with the waste sludge in the experimental study the sludge had a srt of about 30 d in the mbr and 20 of the mbr sludge was circulated each day though the fermenter as a result the same sludge mass would have passed through the fermenter not once but several times before discharge with the repeated sludge circulation for p release the overall p recovery ratio from wastewater 62 1 for the whole experimental system was considerably higher than the one time p release ratio 44 4 in the anaerobic fermenter however it should be noted that the sums of the p and fe amounts in the discharging flows including the effluent sludge supernatant and waste sludge are less than 100 of the inputs of p 93 and fe 91 errors would be involved in sludge sampling and chemical analysis in addition p and fe might be lost to the sludge attached to the membrane surface that was washed off periodically from the membrane module these amounts of p and fe were not quantified in the study which would result in the low estimations of p and fe for the mass balance analysis the operating condition of the p removal and recovery system and p related material flow are summarised in table 1 according to the mass balance as given in eq 6 the overall p recovery was affected by a number of factors including the p removal efficiency by the aerobic mbr r 1 the daily mbr sludge recirculation ratio for fermentation r s the ratio of supernatant collected from the fermented sludge r l the p release efficiency during the acidogenic fermentation r p the hrt θ and the srt θ c the p removal efficiency r 1 by the mbr could reach 96 for an fe dosage of 20 mg l the daily mbr sludge recirculation ratio r s was set at 10 for fermentation and the ratio of supernatant from the fermented sludge r l was kept at 0 625 given these conditions the ratio of p release from sludge r p after 48 h of batch fermentation was 0 44 for a food waste cod loading of 2 g l by applying those values into the mass balance equations the simulated proportions of p in the effluent recovered precipitates and disposal sludge were 3 9 66 7 and 29 4 respectively these values are similar to the experimental data of 3 6 62 1 and 27 3 respectively the mass balance equations can be a useful tool for predicting the p flow transformation and recovery throughout this mbr sludge acidogenesis system the simulation results suggest that the mbr sludge recirculation rate and the fraction of supernatant after sludge fermentation were important to the overall p recovery efficiency a higher sludge recirculation ratio and a higher fraction of supernatant withdrawn from the fermented sludge would considerably increase the p recovery efficiency nonetheless the ratio of p release from the mbr sludge during fermentation was the crucial factor for the p recovery efficiency the p release ratio was affected by the anaerobic fermentation conditions including the organic loading fermentation period and solution ph according to batch tests a high organic loading rate long fermentation time and low ph value would facilitate the p release from the mbr sludge moreover srt had a great impact on the p recovery potential and a longer srt for the mbr with less sludge discharge would help increase the overall p recovery efficiency for instance if the srt increased from 30 to 90 d in the test system while the other factors remained the same according to eq 6 the p recovery efficiency would be increased from 66 7 to 83 7 in fact a long srt is known to be one of the advantages for mbr wu et al 2017 the side stream sludge fermentation for p and fe extractions would allow a longer srt without the problem of p and inorganic accumulations in the mbr tanks 3 4 comparison of acidification and acidogenesis extraction of p from the mbr sludge by chemical acidification was also conducted in comparison with the result of anaerobic acidogenesis for chemical acidification by dosing hcl the release of fe and p increased as the solution ph decreased and the release became significant as the ph dropped to below 2 0 fig 8 the observed release of fe and p from the mbr sludge by acidification resulted from the chemical desorption and dissolution and the main species of fe dissolved was fe iii when the ph dropped to 1 0 63 7 of the total p and 94 4 of the total fe were released from the sludge into the supernatant in comparison the fe and p released from the sludge could occur under a much milder condition through acidogenic sludge fermentation with the dissimilatory iron reduction more than 80 of the total fe was present as fe ii in the fermented sludge fig 4 for a ph of around 4 0 during fermentation 54 7 of total p and 76 7 of total fe could be released from the mbr sludge unlike in chemical acidification anaerobic acidogenesis induced p release from the sludge without the use of strong acids the low ph acidification condition could dissolve many other chemicals from the sludge such as ca mg al and heavy metals into the supernatant which might affect the effectiveness and quality of p recovery by precipitation more importantly unlike acidogenic fermentation the sludge after the strong chemical acidification would be largely deactivated and destroyed and thus could not be returned to the mbr for biological wastewater treatment 3 5 mechanisms for the p removal and recovery 3 5 1 chemically enhanced p removal the main pathways for p removal and recovery in this new mbr sludge acidogenesis system are illustrated in fig 9 in the aerobic mbr tank a portion of phosphate was converted to organic p through biosynthesis which accounted for only a small fraction for total p removal lee et al 2008 with the chemical dosing most p in wastewater was precipitated by fecl3 or adsorbed by ferric iron oxides to form a fe iii p complex which may be simplified as follows 8 f e 3 p o 4 3 h 2 o f e i i i p s the p species analysis result shows that p was bound mainly to iron oxides in the mbr sludge which accounted for about 60 of tp in the mbr fig 4 wu et al 2015 fe po4 mineral was also detected in mbr sludge which accounted for around 6 of the tp removed however the chemical extraction method used for speciation analysis has shortcomings in efficiency and accuracy besides the chemical species may be changed during the chemical treatment at each extraction step more powerful detection techniques such as x ray absorption spectroscopy xas and nuclear magnetic resonance nmr can be applied for more reliable and accurate analysis according to the xas detection by wu et al 2015 the main p species in mbr sludge included distinct fe po4 mineral and po4 3 adsorbed to the iron oxyhydroxide mineral phase feooh the strong bonding between p and the fe iii complex improved the removal performance and retained most of p in the mbr wilfert et al 2015 3 5 2 acidogenic co fermentation for p release and recovery in the side stream sludge fermentation p was extracted and released in the form of orthophosphate into the supernatant through biological acidogenesis and dissimilatory iron reduction which can be described as follows 9 f e i i i p s c h 2 o f e 2 p o 4 3 c o 2 h 2 o microorganisms used organics to produce vfas and hence lowered the solution ph they also played a significant role in mediating fe oxidation and reduction reactions weber et al 2006 more specifically fe iii can act as elector acceptors in microbial metabolism to provide energy for cell growth under an anaerobic condition the possible metabolisms are as follows i fermentative metabolism fe iii is reduced in digestion of monomers such as sugars and amino acids lovley 1991 10 24 f e i i i c 6 h 12 o 6 6 h 2 o 24 f e i i 6 c o 2 24 h ii hydrogen oxidation fe iii is reduced by hydrogen in an anaerobic environment lovley and goodwin 1988 11 f e i i i h 2 f e i i 2 h iii organic acid oxidation the oxidation of organic acids especially acetate is coupled with the reduction of fe iii finke et al 2007 12 8 f e i i i c h 3 c o o h 2 h 2 o 8 f e i i c o 2 8 h in the present study after chemical precipitation fe iii accumulated in the mbr sludge sufficient electron donors were required to achieve effective iron reduction with the food waste addition for co fermentation vfas were produced and fe iii was reduced to fe ii in the fermenter the large amount of vfas suggests that organic acid oxidation would be the main metabolism contributing to the reduction of fe iii the fe iii based complex was then transformed into fe ii based including the transformations of fe iii po4 mineral to fe ii po4 and feooh or fe oh 3 to fe oh 2 these fe ii based compounds are much more soluble than their fe iii based counterparts under a weak acid condition ph 5 the adsorption bonding between p and ferrous ion oxides is also less stable than that between p and ferric iron oxides de best et al 1995 the fe ii p complex thus dissolved and released ferrous ion and orthophosphate into the supernatant for the batch sludge fermentation with a 4 g cod l food waste addition as shown in fig 4a the fraction of iron oxides p reduced significantly from 61 8 to 13 7 and the soluble p increased from 0 1 to 54 0 during the chemical precipitation for p recovery from the supernatant of the fermented sludge after the adjustment of the solution ph to 8 sfe ii and sp precipitated together as follows to form vivianite 13 f e 2 p o 4 3 h 2 o f e 3 p o 4 2 8 h 2 o s which can be readily recovered for making valuable p fertilizers eynard et al 1992 4 conclusions a novel process for enhanced p removal and recovery in municipal wastewater treatment was developed which included ferric iron dosing and flocculation an aerobic mbr and side stream acidogenic sludge fermentation the sludge from the mbr was circulated through the side stream fermenters for fe and p dissolution and extraction by co fermentation with a model food waste 2 g cod l for 2 d the mbr sludge underwent acidogenesis and dissimilatory iron reduction leading to a ph decrease to below 5 0 and effective reduction of fe iii to fe ii with a much increased solubility of the fe ii based than fe iii based compounds about 44 4 of p and 45 9 of fe were then released from the sludge into the supernatant an overall p recovery of 62 1 from the wastewater can be achieved in the form of vivianite and the inorganic build up problem in the mbr can be alleviated compared to chemical acidification for p extraction from sludge co fermentation allows effective p recovery without using strong acids also acidogenesis does not inactivate biomass so the fermented sludge is returned to the mbr to maintain its long srt the research presents an innovative environmentally friendly chemical biological process for enhanced p removal and recovery during the course of wastewater treatment mass balance was well established to help understand the p flow and transformation through the different stages of the process and to evaluate the influences of
