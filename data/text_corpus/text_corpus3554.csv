17770,although the ozonation of common antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin cip in water has been well studied the influence of bromide that is present at high levels in seawater is essentially unknown in this study we investigated the effect of bromide on the reaction kinetics formation of transformation products tps reaction pathways and toxicity in the ozonation of cip bromide significantly accelerated the transformation of cip by ozone likely due to the formation of reactive bromine species based on time of flight high resolution mass spectrometry and suspect screening a total of 26 tps including 13 previously unknown products were identified in artificial seawater while only 9 of them were found in pure water without bromide the transformation of cip in artificial seawater was found to involve four major processes oxidation at the piperazinyl moiety with the addition of hydroxyl group s to the ring and ring cleavage oxidation at the quinolone moiety and bromination in contrast the ozonation of cip in pure water occurred only at the piperazinyl moiety in addition bromide also enhanced the removal of toxicity towards escherichia coli this study suggests that careful

ozonation of cip and other 13 antibiotics in municipal wastewater was selective in the oxidation of these compounds biochemically essential moieties with fluoroquinolones and lincomycins being less reactive with ozone the ozonation of cip produces different transformation products tps with variable reductions in the residual antibacterial activity dodd et al 2009 dewitte et al 2010 liu et al

2004 deborde and von gunten 2008 heeb et al 2014 moreover the halogenated products may have greater biological activity as compared to non halogenated tps richardson et al 2003 sivey et al 2015 previous studies showed that cip is widely present in seawater as a result of veterinary and human medicine consumptions for example cip was one of the most frequently detected antibiotics in chinese coastal waters with a concentration range of 243 55200 ng l 1 li et al 2018 lu et al 2018 identification of possible tps has been a bottleneck in understanding ozonation of antibiotics and the challenge lies in the general lack of reference standards in recent years suspect screening using high resolution mass spectrometer hrms has been increasingly applied for seeking and identifying unknown tps bletsou et al 2015 the approach allows screening and detection of a wide range of compounds as long as they can be ionized under the employed ionization conditions hollender et al 2017 gosetti et al 2016 additional information on tps chemical structures may be obtained by ms2 analysis further increasing the confidence levels of identification schymanski et al 2014 this combination has been proved to be an attractive and powerful approach for the rapid screening of multiclass organic pollutants in water and has been successfully employed to investigate tps of emerging contaminants in several recent studies deeb et al 2017 gago ferrero et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 the objective of this study was to systematically investigate the influence of bromide on the ozonation of cip in water by considering reaction kinetics formation of tps and pathways the combination of suspect screening with hrms was used to identify tps based on the identified tps possible reaction pathways were proposed in addition the residual antimicrobial activity of reaction mixtures was evaluated using escherichia coli e coli 2 materials and method 2 1 chemicals the standard of cip 92 was purchased from dr ehrenstorfer gmbh augsburg germany standards of 3 5 dimethyl 1h pyrazole dmpz 99 4 bromo 3 5 dimethyl 1h pyrazole bdmpz 99 and formic acid 95 were purchased from sigma aldrich st louis mo methanol and acetonitrile of high performance liquid chromatography hplc grade were purchased from tedia fairfield ia other chemicals used were of analytical grade and were purchased from xilong chemical reagents shantou guangdong china reagent water 18 2 mω cm resistivity was prepared using a millipore water purification system millipore bedford ma the preparation of artificial seawater and stock solution of rbs is given in text s1 supporting information the concentrations of bromide and chloride in the artificial seawater were 0 8 mmol l 1 and 0 56 mol l 1 respectively 2 2 reaction setup the preparation and titration of aqueous ozone are given in text s1 the ozonation of cip was carried out in a batch reaction system briefly aliquots of reaction mixtures 10 ml containing a certain amount of cip ozone and halide ions were added to 30 ml glass vials with teflon lined caps the reaction mixtures were maintained at 25 0 5 c and constantly shaken at 180 rpm the effect of ozone doses on the reaction was evaluated by changing the initial ozone doses at 62 5 125 0 and 187 5 μmol l 1 while fixing cip concentration at 3 0 μmol l 1 to investigate ph effect a suite of reactions were carried out in ph 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 and 9 0 buffer solutions while keeping the initial ozone dose at 125 0 μmol l 1 and cip at 3 0 μmol l 1 the effect of halide ions was assessed by varying bromide from 0 to 0 8 mmol l 1 and chloride from 0 to 0 56 mol l 1 while keeping the initial aqueous ozone at 125 0 μmol l 1 and cip at 3 0 μmol l 1 unless otherwise noted the experiments were carried out in ph 7 0 10 mmol l 1 phosphate buffer solutions and fixing initial aqueous ozone dose at 125 0 μmol l 1 at designated time intervals 0 5 10 20 40 60 and 120 min triplicate treatments were withdrawn and the reaction was immediately quenched by adding an excess amount of na2s2o3 to remove the residual aqueous ozone the samples were then taken to analyze cip residue and reaction products as described below to investigate the formation of rbs in the reactions a suite of similar treatments without the addition of cip were included in the experiment and the formed rbs was determined using a method described elsewhere lu et al 2019 the underlying mechanism for the analytical method is that rbs in water was able to rapidly react with dmpz and stoichiometrically 1 1 transformed to bdmpz more detailed information on the determination of rbs is available in text s1 the effects of ph halide ions and ozone dose on the formation of rbs were also assessed by conducting similar experiments using various ph buffer solutions halide ions and ozone doses to investigate the direct reaction of rbs with cip 3 0 μmol l 1 cip was added to vials and the reaction was initiated by the addition of 30 μmol l 1 rbs at designated time intervals triplicate treatments were withdrawn and the reaction was quenched by adding an excess amount of na2s2o3 the resulting samples were taken to analyze cip residues to observe the reaction kinetics the effect of ph on the oxidation kinetics of cip was evaluated by varying solution ph values at 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 and 9 0 the apparent disappearance of cip in the reaction solutions was fit to a pseudo first order kinetics model 1 ln cip t cip 0 k obs t where k obs is the observed pseudo first order rate constant cip 0 and cip t are the initial and residual concentration of cip at time t respectively 2 3 bioassay to evaluate the change of toxicity before and after ozonation the antibacterial activity of treated samples was assessed via an in vivo assay using e coli dh5α the bacteria in a freeze dried powder were purchased from transgen biotech beijing china prior to bioassay 200 μl of bacteria were reactivated in ice and transferred into a 250 ml erlenmeyer flask containing 100 ml luria bertani broth miller 1972 the mixture was continuously mixed and shaken at 90 rpm the cultures were harvested after 12 h incubation and the optical density at 600 nm od600 was measured against the blank of growth medium using a uv 1100d spectrophotometer mapada shanghai china a certain volume of the bacterial cultures was withdrawn and diluted to 100 ml with luria bertani broth to yield an od600 of 0 285 subsequently 5 ml of treated samples were added to the suspension all cultures were incubated at 37 c and shaken at 90 rpm at designated time intervals 0 0 5 1 2 3 4 6 and 12 h od600 was measured for each culture against the blank of growth medium the inhibition rate ir was calculated by the following equation 2 ir 1 od600s od600c 100 where od600s and od600c are the od600 values of sample and control measured at the same time 2 4 chemical analysis to determine cip residue in the reaction solutions the collected samples were directly analyzed on an hplc system coupled with a diode array detector shimadzu japan detailed information on the analysis of cip residue is available in text s1 for product identification the collected samples 200 ml were extracted with 60 mg oasis hydrophilic lipophilic balance solid phase extraction cartridges waters milford ma briefly the samples were passed through the cartridges that were sequentially preconditioned with 5 ml of methanol and 5 ml of reagent water the cartridges were then rinsed with 5 ml of reagent water and eluted with 10 ml of methanol the elution was collected and blown to dryness under a gentle nitrogen stream the extract was finally brought into 1 ml of methanol and filtered through a pvdf syringe filter 0 22 μm pore size the final samples were analyzed on an acquity uplc h class system coupled to a xevo g2 xs qtof hrms with electrospray ionization uplc esi qtof hrms waters the chromatographic separation was obtained on a proshell 120 ec c18 column 100 mm 2 1 mm i d particle size 2 7 μm agilent protected with a c18 guard column particle size 2 7 μm the mobile phases consisted of acetonitrile and water containing 0 1 aqueous formic acid with a flow rate of 0 3 ml min 1 the sample injection volume was 10 μl following sample injection elution of analytes was achieved by holding the proportion of acetonitrile at 10 from 0 to 2 min increasing to 100 from 2 to 11 min holding at 100 from 11 to 13 min decreasing to 10 from 13 to 13 1 min and holding at 10 until 20 min to re equilibrate the column prior to the next injection to acquire the exact mass of precursor ions esi source was operated in positive mode esi and the ms spectra were recorded in full scan mode with an m z range of 100 1200 product ions of the identified compounds were also obtained via ms2 analysis in the ms2 analysis the hrms analyzer was operated in sensitivity mode and the other ms parameters were as follow high resolution mass spectra capillary voltage 2500 v cone voltage 30 v cone gas flow 50 l h 1 source temperature 140 c desolvation temperature 450 c desolvation gas flow 950 l h 1 scan time 0 2 s collision energy ramp 0 80 v 2 5 quality assurance and quality control several measures were taken to enhance the accuracy of the exact mass measurement in product identification the exact masses were automatically acquired using the qtof hrms with lockspray dual esi source which enabled the co introduction of analyte and lock mass compound leucine encephalin with m z of m h 556 2771 da waters directly into the ion source providing internal lock mass calibration for ms and ms2 analysis therefore lockspray could eliminate instrumental shift and potential ionization interferences between analytes and the standard to verify whether there were any impurities or artifacts resulted from sample handling and to avoid any possible overlapping two control treatments were carried out in artificial seawater without the addition of either aqueous ozone or cip the standard of cip and methanol solvent were successively run on the uplc qtof hrms in between every five samples to monitor instrumental background contamination background contamination from the solvent blank and control samples was subtracted from samples for subsequent data interpretation all products were identified with abundances three times higher than the background abundances in blank and control samples the molecular formulas of identified products were assigned by software based mass assignments using their exact masses and isotope patterns for brominated products the threshold of deviation for measured exact masses for the identified compounds was less than 10 parts per million ppm because bromine has two natural isotopes 79br m z 78 9183 and 81br m z 80 9163 compounds containing bromine atom s could provide additional information for precursor ion alignment an isotope simulation was also performed using waters masslynx data analysis software version4 1 waters to cross validate the assigned molecular formulas 3 results and discussion 3 1 cip oxidation kinetics typical oxidation profiles of cip by ozone in various solutions are given in fig 1 overall the apparent disappearance of cip in the reaction solutions could be well described by the pseudo first order kinetic model r 2 0 94 apparently ozone could destruct cip in the aqueous solutions with or without br and cl the removal of cip may be attributable to several direct and indirect oxidative processes in the pure water aqueous ozone could react directly with cip or decompose to produce oh which also served as a strong oxidant to cip in the presence of br and cl ozone and oh may oxidize br and cl to form rbs and rcs parker and mitch 2016 however the reactivity between ozone and cl with a reaction rate constant k of 3 0 10 3 l mol 1 s 1 is much lower than that between ozone and br k 160 l mol 1 s 1 haag and hoigne 1983 hoigne et al 1985 in addition the resulting rcs might also rapidly oxidize br to rbs with a k value of about 6 84 103 l mol 1 s 1 voudrias and reinhard 1988 therefore rbs were the major reactive halide species formed in the reaction solutions with the coexistence of br and cl accordingly the reaction of cip with rbs could contribute to the disappearance of cip for reactions containing br and cl it is evident that cip removal and k obs were both enhanced by a higher dose of aqueous ozone for example the removal of cip in the pure water in 60 min was 32 6 with 62 5 μmol l 1 of ozone and increased to 64 3 with 187 5 μmol l 1 of ozone fig 1a accordingly the corresponding k obs values increased from 1 9 10 2 min 1 to 6 2 10 2 min 1 fig 1b similarly dewitte et al 2009 found that k obs values for the oxidation of cip varied from 8 1 10 3 to 6 6 10 2 min 1 with various doses of ozone this result could be easily explained by the fact that an increase of ozone dosage provided more oxidative species including oh and rbs fig 1c the reactions were generally accelerated by halide ions in the reactions of cip with 187 5 μmol l 1 of ozone the k obs values were 6 2 10 2 min 1 for the reaction in pure water while 2 5 10 1 min 1 for the reaction with 0 80 mmol l 1 of br such similar enhancing effects by br could also be observed for the treatments with 62 5 μmol l 1 and 125 0 μmol l 1 of ozone fig 1b and fig s1 the enhancing effects could be contributed to the formation of rbs in the treatment with br for example 15 4 μmol l 1 of rbs could be generated in 1 min in the treatment with 0 80 mmol l 1 of br while no rbs was observed in pure water fig 1d in contrast cl only slightly increased the k obs values probably because of the bromide impurity in sodium chloride this assumption was supported by the fact that about 3 0 10 3 μmol l 1 of rbs was measured in the treatment with 0 56 mol l 1 of cl however the removal of cip in the reaction with 0 56 mol l 1 cl in 60 min was lower than that in pure water likely due to the simultaneously consumption of ozone by cl as the reaction proceeded ph was another important factor that influenced the ozonation process the reaction rate of cip decreased from 1 2 10 1 to 8 7 10 2 min 1 as ph increased from 5 0 to 9 0 in artificial seawater fig 2 suggesting that acidic conditions facilitated cip transformation the ph dependent reaction of cip with ozone may be attributed to several factors first the direct reaction of cip with ozone decreased as the ph increased fig 2a for instance the k obs values in reaction with pure water decreased from 4 3 10 2 min 1 to 1 4 10 2 min 1 as ph increased from 5 0 to 9 0 likely due to the fast self decomposition of ozone as ph increased grguric et al 1994 von gunten 2003 dewitte et al 1994 also found that the reaction of cip with ozone favored acidic conditions second the generation of rbs in the reaction with br also declined as ph increased from 5 0 to 9 0 fig 2b especially in the first 1 min third the reactivity of cip with rbs decreased as ph increased from 5 0 to 9 0 fig 2c for example the degradation rates decreased from 0 18 to 6 1 10 2 min 1 as ph increased from 5 0 to 9 0 similar to our finding a previous study found that the reactivity of rbs favored acidic conditions grguric et al 1994 last ph governed the species distribution of cip because cip has the first and second acid dissociations of pka1 5 9 and pka2 8 9 drakopoulos and ioannou 1997 accordingly cip mainly occurred in cationic form in ph 5 9 solutions and in anionic form in ph 8 9 solutions i e the percentage of cip species followed the order of protonated neutral deprotonated as ph increased from 5 0 to 9 0 these different ionic states of cip might affect the reactivity dodd et al 2006 and wang et al 2010 also found similar effects in the reaction of cip with ozone and chlorine dioxide 3 2 product identification a summary of the tentatively identified tps is given in table 1 and the corresponding structure of each tp is given in fig 3 overall possible tps from two major transformation pathways including oxidation and bromination were screened using suspect screening strategy gago ferrero et al 2018 a total of nine tps tp1 tp9 was identified in the ozonation of cip in pure water in contrast 26 tps including tp1 tp13 and their corresponding monobrominated compounds were identified in the ozonation of cip in artificial seawater the identification of tps is outlined below first more than 120 potential tps and their exact masses were proposed based on the ozonation of cip in pure water and artificial seawater the quasimolecular ions m h of suspected tps were derived from the centroid raw ms data of uplc qtof hrms the quasimolecular ions were then fit to the proposed tps all quasimolecular ions m h for the identified tps showed the exact mass deviations being 10 ppm table 1 furthermore the ms2 spectra and interpretation of tps were obtained and given in figs s2 s15 these results clearly suggest that the quasimolecular ions of tps derived from the hrms analysis were highly reliable on the basis of the structure of cip and the derived quasimolecular ions and ms2 product ion scan of each tp the structures of tps were proposed for most of the tps retaining cooh group the base peak of fragment ion was generally found to be m h h2o according to the diverse structures of tps other characteristic daughter ions could also be observed for each tp for example products tp1 tp4 were inferred as the products from the oxidation of cip at the piperazinyl moiety with ring cleavage the ms2 spectra of tp1 tp4 exhibited a characteristic daughter ion of at m z 217 0339 suggesting that these tps retained the skeleton analogous of 7 amino 1 cyclopropyl 6 fluoroquinolin 4 1h one figs s3 s6 moreover tp2 showed distinctive fragment ions at m z 280 9816 for the neutral loss of cyclopropene from m h and 258 0745 for the loss of conh2 from m h h2o in contrast tp3 displayed unique fragment ions at m z 268 1061 for the successive neutral losses of hf and h2o and 245 1058 for the losses of nh3 and co2 both from m h products tp5 tp9 were inferred to be products from the oxidation of cip at the piperazinyl moiety with the addition of oxygen atom or hydroxyl group to the ring the hydroxyl derivative tp5 showed a characteristic ion at m z 306 1264 indicating the loss of fragment nch2ch2 from m h however no neutral loss of hf was observed in tp5 suggesting that the substitution of oh was likely occurred at the position 3 rather than 2 in the piperazinyl ring fig s7 in contrast the dihydroxyl derivative tp6 displayed unique ions at m z 346 1213 for m h h2o hf and 303 0792 for m h h2o c2h5n suggesting that the substitution of dihydoxyl took place at the positions c2 and c3 in the piperazinyl ring fig s8 using the similar fragmentation patterns of tp1 tp4 the structures of tp7 tp9 could be easily explained unlike the other tps both tp10 and tp11 showed an obvious neutral loss of o2 in ms2 scan figs s12 and s13 for example tp10 had a characteristic ion at m z 314 0953 for m h h2o o2 while tp11 at m z 257 0706 for m h nhch2 h2o o2 this observation coincided with the structures of tp10 and tp11 that contain carboxyl or ketone groups at c2 and c3 therefore tp10 and tp11 were inferred as n formylanthranilic acid analogue in contrast tp12 and tp13 did not have the typical fragment ion of m h h2o suggesting the lack of cooh in the two tps figs s14 and s15 therefore tp12 and tp13 were inferred to be the analogue of isatin the identification of brominated tps br tps was generally based on the bromination of cip and tp1 tp13 all of the br tps showed strong quasimolecular ions m h and m 2 h with a ratio close to 1 1 suggesting that they were monobrominated compound for example br cip showed characteristic parent ions at m z 410 0524 and 412 0523 with a ratio near 1 1 the fragment ion at m z 370 1384 was likely due to the neutral loss of cyclopropene from m h similar to that observed in the ms2 scan of cip fig s2 br cip was therefore inferred as monobrominated cip using the same protocol the other br tps were tentatively identified to be monobrominated tp1 tp13 br tp1 br tp13 except br tp7 3 3 reaction pathways on the basis of the identified tps and knowledge of similar reactions the possible pathways are summarized in fig 3 overall the detected tps could be contributed to the oxidation of cip by either molecular ozone or the resulting oh and rbs via four processes oxidation at the piperazinyl moiety with the ring cleavage p i oxidation at the piperazinyl moiety with the addition of oxygen atom or hydroxyl group to the ring p ii oxidation at the quinolone moiety p iii and bromination of cip and intermediates p iv in the pathway p i the piperazine ring of cip was oxidized to release c2h2 forming desethylene cip tp3 the further oxidation of tp3 may result in either the loss of nc2h5 group to produce tp4 or the addition of an oxygen atom to form a keto derivative tp2 additional subsequent oxidation of tp2 yielded tp1 this pathway was also found in the ozonation of cip in wastewater liu et al 2012 likewise dewitte et al 2008 identified tp3 and tp4 in the ozonation of cip in pure water and proposed a similar pathway the formation of tps may also initiate from the reaction of cip with oh by introducing a hydroxyl group to the piperazinyl moiety p ii for example hydroxylation of cip produced hydroxyl derivative tp5 and dihydroxyl derivative tp6 similar to our finding tp5 and tp6 were commonly found in the oxidation of cip via other aops paul et al 2010 liu et al 2012 the hydroxyl derivatives were susceptible to oxidation by molecular ozone and produced keto derivatives of the piperazinyl ring tp7 and tp8 the further oxidation of tp8 by ozone caused the cleavage of the piperazinyl ring and formed tp9 it should be noted that tp7 could also be oxidized to tp2 while tp8 to tp1 product tp9 was previously found in the oxidation of cip by chlorine dioxide and manganese oxide zhang and huang 2005 wang et al 2010 an important observation in this study was the finding of tp10 tp13 in the ozonation of cip in the presence of br generally the oxidation of cip by molecular ozone and oh takes place at the piperazine ring p i and p ii dewitte et al 2008 liu et al 2012 however the quinolone moiety remained intact to molecular ozone while it may undergo ring cleavage by the attack of oh dewitte et al 2008 liu et al 2012 in this study only products tp1 tp9 were observed in the ozonation of cip in pure water suggesting that p i and p ii were the major pathways while p iii could be negligible even if there was any besides tp1 tp9 products tp10 tp13 were also detected in the reaction in artificial seawater this result clearly suggested that the cleavage of quinolone moiety in cip was significantly enhanced by br likely due to the formation of rbs moreover products tp1 tp13 were also observed in the direct reaction of cip with rbs therefore we proposed that the reaction of cip with rbs led to the breakage of c2 c3 bond adjacent to the carboxylic acid group forming n formylanthranilic acid analogue tp10 p iii the intermediate tp10 was not stable and was vulnerable to further conversion under oxidative conditions producing tp11 subsequent oxidation caused the intramolecular cyclization of tp11 by releasing hcooh producing an isatin analogue tp12 liu et al 2012 product tp12 may be further oxidized to tp13 via similar pathways as described before bromination was another important pathway for the ozonation of cip in the presence of br p iv as described above rbs could be readily formed when br were introduced into the reaction the resulting rbs may react with cip and tp1 tp13 for example the bromination of cip led to the formation of 8 brominated cip br cip the reaction of rbs with cip likely occurred via electrophilic substitution accordingly the negative partial charge δ in the aromatic ring of cip was susceptible to attack by the positive partial charge δ of the bromine atom in rbs march 1985 acero et al 2005 the substitution of bromine preferentially took place at the position c8 to c5 on the aromatic ring because of the electron withdrawing group f at c6 and the electron donating substituent piperazine ring at c7 acero et al 2005 a similar substitution pattern was observed in the chlorination of cip by chlorine dodd et al 2005 theoretically the other br tps may be produced either from the bromination of tp1 tp13 or from the further oxidation of br cip via similar pathways observed for cip given the complexity of pathways as the reaction proceeded we could not explicitly propose a pathway for each br tp in addition no higher brominated congeners were detected in this study suggesting that the further bromination of monobrominated tps could be neglected 3 4 residual toxicity of reaction mixture bromide in the reaction apparently enhanced the removal of toxicity toward e coli fig 4 in pure water the reaction mixture for 1 h ozonation of cip almost retained the same toxicity towards e coli as that of the parent compound cip however 50 of cip was found to be decomposed in the reaction these results together suggested that the tps in the ozonation of cip in pure water still preserved toxicity towards e coli it was reported that the antibacterial activity of cip was essentially ascribed to the quinolone moiety shen et al 1989 in addition the transformation of cip in pure water mainly occurred at piperazinyl moiety p i and p ii while the destruction of quinolone moiety p iii was not observed as described before in contrast the residual toxicity of the reaction mixture in artificial seawater decreased significantly the decrease of toxicity in artificial seawater reactions could be explained by two major reasons first br enhanced the transformation of cip and only 35 cip residue was found in the mixture after the reaction on the other hand the 65 loss of cip may partially result from the cleavage of quinolone moiety forming less toxic tps 4 conclusions this study clearly demonstrated that the ozonation of cip in water with br was significantly different from that occurred in pure water due to the formation of rbs in the former reaction compared to the reaction in pure water br in artificial seawater enhanced the reaction produced more products including br tps with higher toxicity potentials diversified pathways with the additional reaction of cip with rbs and increased the removal of residual toxicity of the reaction mixture towards e coli in view of the abundance of br in seawater and saline water these effects should be taken into consideration when ozonation is employed for the disinfection of these waters although br mostly exhibited enhancing effects on the removal of cip by ozonation in the study a more comprehensive risk assessment is necessary because of the formation of complex intermediates and the potential ecotoxicity of br tps declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

br2o hobr obr br2 br br2 broh and brcl williams et al 1978 von gunten 2003 grebel et al 2010 the further reaction of rcs and rbs with organic compounds may produce chlorinated and brominated disinfection by products parker and mitch 2016 langsa et al 2017 the reaction of rbs with organic compounds was estimated to be several orders of magnitude faster than that of rcs westerhoff et al 2004 deborde and von gunten 2008 heeb et al 2014 moreover the halogenated products may have greater biological activity as compared to non halogenated tps richardson et al 2003 sivey et al 2015 previous studies showed that cip is widely present in seawater as a result of veterinary and human medicine consumptions for example cip was one of the most frequently detected antibiotics in chinese coastal waters with a concentration range of 243 55200 ng l 1 li et al 2018 lu et al 2018 identification of possible tps has been a bottleneck in understanding ozonation of antibiotics and the challenge lies in the general lack of reference standards in recent years suspect screening using high resolution mass spectrometer hrms has been increasingly applied for seeking and identifying unknown tps bletsou et al 2015 the approach allows screening and detection of a wide range of compounds as long as they can be ionized under the employed ionization conditions hollender et al 2017 gosetti et al 2016 additional information on tps chemical structures may be obtained by ms2 analysis further increasing the confidence levels of identification schymanski et al 2014 this combination has been proved to be an attractive and powerful approach for the rapid screening of multiclass organic pollutants in water and has been successfully employed to investigate tps of emerging contaminants in several recent studies deeb et al 2017 gago ferrero et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 the objective of this study was to systematically investigate the influence of bromide on the ozonation of cip in water by considering reaction kinetics formation of tps and pathways the combination of suspect screening with hrms was used to identify tps based on the identified tps possible reaction pathways were proposed in addition the residual antimicrobial activity of reaction mixtures was evaluated using escherichia coli e coli 2 materials and method 2 1 chemicals the standard of cip 92 was purchased from dr ehrenstorfer gmbh augsburg germany standards of 3 5 dimethyl 1h pyrazole dmpz 99 4 bromo 3 5 dimethyl 1h pyrazole bdmpz 99 and formic acid 95 were purchased from sigma aldrich st louis mo methanol and acetonitrile of high performance liquid chromatography hplc grade were purchased from tedia fairfield ia other chemicals used were of analytical grade and were purchased from xilong chemical reagents shantou guangdong china reagent water 18 2 mω cm resistivity was prepared using a millipore water purification system millipore bedford ma the preparation of artificial seawater and stock solution of rbs is given in text s1 supporting information the concentrations of bromide and chloride in the artificial seawater were 0 8 mmol l 1 and 0 56 mol l 1 respectively 2 2 reaction setup the preparation and titration of aqueous ozone are given in text s1 the ozonation of cip was carried out in a batch reaction system briefly aliquots of reaction mixtures 10 ml containing a certain amount of cip ozone and halide ions were added to 30 ml glass vials with teflon lined caps the reaction mixtures were maintained at 25 0 5 c and constantly shaken at 180 rpm the effect of ozone doses on the reaction was evaluated by changing the initial ozone doses at 62 5 125 0 and 187 5 μmol l 1 while fixing cip concentration at 3 0 μmol l 1 to investigate ph effect a suite of reactions were carried out in ph 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 and 9 0 buffer solutions while keeping the initial ozone dose at 125 0 μmol l 1 and cip at 3 0 μmol l 1 the effect of halide ions was assessed by varying bromide from 0 to 0 8 mmol l 1 and chloride from 0 to 0 56 mol l 1 while keeping the initial aqueous ozone at 125 0 μmol l 1 and cip at 3 0 μmol l 1 unless otherwise noted the experiments were carried out in ph 7 0 10 mmol l 1 phosphate buffer solutions and fixing initial aqueous ozone dose at 125 0 μmol l 1 at designated time intervals 0 5 10 20 40 60 and 120 min triplicate treatments were withdrawn and the reaction was immediately quenched by adding an excess amount of na2s2o3 to remove the residual aqueous ozone the samples were then taken to analyze cip residue and reaction products as described below to investigate the formation of rbs in the reactions a suite of similar treatments without the addition of cip were included in the experiment and the formed rbs was determined using a method described elsewhere lu et al 2019 the underlying mechanism for the analytical method is that rbs in water was able to rapidly react with dmpz and stoichiometrically 1 1 transformed to bdmpz more detailed information on the determination of rbs is available in text s1 the effects of ph halide ions and ozone dose on the formation of rbs were also assessed by conducting similar experiments using various ph buffer solutions halide ions and ozone doses to investigate the direct reaction of rbs with cip 3 0 μmol l 1 cip was added to vials and the reaction was initiated by the addition of 30 μmol l 1 rbs at designated time intervals triplicate treatments were withdrawn and the reaction was quenched by adding an excess amount of na2s2o3 the resulting samples were taken to analyze cip residues to observe the reaction kinetics the effect of ph on the oxidation kinetics of cip was evaluated by varying solution ph values at 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 and 9 0 the apparent disappearance of cip in the reaction solutions was fit to a pseudo first order kinetics model 1 ln cip t cip 0 k obs t where k obs is the observed pseudo first order rate constant cip 0 and cip t are the initial and residual concentration of cip at time t respectively 2 3 bioassay to evaluate the change of toxicity before and after ozonation the antibacterial activity of treated samples was assessed via an in vivo assay using e coli dh5α the bacteria in a freeze dried powder were purchased from transgen biotech beijing china prior to bioassay 200 μl of bacteria were reactivated in ice and transferred into a 250 ml erlenmeyer flask containing 100 ml luria bertani broth miller 1972 the mixture was continuously mixed and shaken at 90 rpm the cultures were harvested after 12 h incubation and the optical density at 600 nm od600 was measured against the blank of growth medium using a uv 1100d spectrophotometer mapada shanghai china a certain volume of the bacterial cultures was withdrawn and diluted to 100 ml with luria bertani broth to yield an od600 of 0 285 subsequently 5 ml of treated samples were added to the suspension all cultures were incubated at 37 c and shaken at 90 rpm at designated time intervals 0 0 5 1 2 3 4 6 and 12 h od600 was measured for each culture against the blank of growth medium the inhibition rate ir was calculated by the following equation 2 ir 1 od600s od600c 100 where od600s and od600c are the od600 values of sample and control measured at the same time 2 4 chemical analysis to determine cip residue in the reaction solutions the collected samples were directly analyzed on an hplc system coupled with a diode array detector shimadzu japan detailed information on the analysis of cip residue is available in text s1 for product identification the collected samples 200 ml were extracted with 60 mg oasis hydrophilic lipophilic balance solid phase extraction cartridges waters milford ma briefly the samples were passed through the cartridges that were sequentially preconditioned with 5 ml of methanol and 5 ml of reagent water the cartridges were then rinsed with 5 ml of reagent water and eluted with 10 ml of methanol the elution was collected and blown to dryness under a gentle nitrogen stream the extract was finally brought into 1 ml of methanol and filtered through a pvdf syringe filter 0 22 μm pore size the final samples were analyzed on an acquity uplc h class system coupled to a xevo g2 xs qtof hrms with electrospray ionization uplc esi qtof hrms waters the chromatographic separation was obtained on a proshell 120 ec c18 column 100 mm 2 1 mm i d particle size 2 7 μm agilent protected with a c18 guard column particle size 2 7 μm the mobile phases consisted of acetonitrile and water containing 0 1 aqueous formic acid with a flow rate of 0 3 ml min 1 the sample injection volume was 10 μl following sample injection elution of analytes was achieved by holding the proportion of acetonitrile at 10 from 0 to 2 min increasing to 100 from 2 to 11 min holding at 100 from 11 to 13 min decreasing to 10 from 13 to 13 1 min and holding at 10 until 20 min to re equilibrate the column prior to the next injection to acquire the exact mass of precursor ions esi source was operated in positive mode esi and the ms spectra were recorded in full scan mode with an m z range of 100 1200 product ions of the identified compounds were also obtained via ms2 analysis in the ms2 analysis the hrms analyzer was operated in sensitivity mode and the other ms parameters were as follow high resolution mass spectra capillary voltage 2500 v cone voltage 30 v cone gas flow 50 l h 1 source temperature 140 c desolvation temperature 450 c desolvation gas flow 950 l h 1 scan time 0 2 s collision energy ramp 0 80 v 2 5 quality assurance and quality control several measures were taken to enhance the accuracy of the exact mass measurement in product identification the exact masses were automatically acquired using the qtof hrms with lockspray dual esi source which enabled the co introduction of analyte and lock mass compound leucine encephalin with m z of m h 556 2771 da waters directly into the ion source providing internal lock mass calibration for ms and ms2 analysis therefore lockspray could eliminate instrumental shift and potential ionization interferences between analytes and the standard to verify whether there were any impurities or artifacts resulted from sample handling and to avoid any possible overlapping two control treatments were carried out in artificial seawater without the addition of either aqueous ozone or cip the standard of cip and methanol solvent were successively run on the uplc qtof hrms in between every five samples to monitor instrumental background contamination background contamination from the solvent blank and control samples was subtracted from samples for subsequent data interpretation all products were identified with abundances three times higher than the background abundances in blank and control samples the molecular formulas of identified products were assigned by software based mass assignments using their exact masses and isotope patterns for brominated products the threshold of deviation for measured exact masses for the identified compounds was less than 10 parts per million ppm because bromine has two natural isotopes 79br m z 78 9183 and 81br m z 80 9163 compounds containing bromine atom s could provide additional information for precursor ion alignment an isotope simulation was also performed using waters masslynx data analysis software version4 1 waters to cross validate the assigned molecular formulas 3 results and discussion 3 1 cip oxidation kinetics typical oxidation profiles of cip by ozone in various solutions are given in fig 1 overall the apparent disappearance of cip in the reaction solutions could be well described by the pseudo first order kinetic model r 2 0 94 apparently ozone could destruct cip in the aqueous solutions with or without br and cl the removal of cip may be attributable to several direct and indirect oxidative processes in the pure water aqueous ozone could react directly with cip or decompose to produce oh which also served as a strong oxidant to cip in the presence of br and cl ozone and oh may oxidize br and cl to form rbs and rcs parker and mitch 2016 however the reactivity between ozone and cl with a reaction rate constant k of 3 0 10 3 l mol 1 s 1 is much lower than that between ozone and br k 160 l mol 1 s 1 haag and hoigne 1983 hoigne et al 1985 in addition the resulting rcs might also rapidly oxidize br to rbs with a k value of about 6 84 103 l mol 1 s 1 voudrias and reinhard 1988 therefore rbs were the major reactive halide species formed in the reaction solutions with the coexistence of br and cl accordingly the reaction of cip with rbs could contribute to the disappearance of cip for reactions containing br and cl it is evident that cip removal and k obs were both enhanced by a higher dose of aqueous ozone for example the removal of cip in the pure water in 60 min was 32 6 with 62 5 μmol l 1 of ozone and increased to 64 3 with 187 5 μmol l 1 of ozone fig 1a accordingly the corresponding k obs values increased from 1 9 10 2 min 1 to 6 2 10 2 min 1 fig 1b similarly dewitte et al 2009 found that k obs values for the oxidation of cip varied from 8 1 10 3 to 6 6 10 2 min 1 with various doses of ozone this result could be easily explained by the fact that an increase of ozone dosage provided more oxidative species including oh and rbs fig 1c the reactions were generally accelerated by halide ions in the reactions of cip with 187 5 μmol l 1 of ozone the k obs values were 6 2 10 2 min 1 for the reaction in pure water while 2 5 10 1 min 1 for the reaction with 0 80 mmol l 1 of br such similar enhancing effects by br could also be observed for the treatments with 62 5 μmol l 1 and 125 0 μmol l 1 of ozone fig 1b and fig s1 the enhancing effects could be contributed to the formation of rbs in the treatment with br for example 15 4 μmol l 1 of rbs could be generated in 1 min in the treatment with 0 80 mmol l 1 of br while no rbs was observed in pure water fig 1d in contrast cl only slightly increased the k obs values probably because of the bromide impurity in sodium chloride this assumption was supported by the fact that about 3 0 10 3 μmol l 1 of rbs was measured in the treatment with 0 56 mol l 1 of cl however the removal of cip in the reaction with 0 56 mol l 1 cl in 60 min was lower than that in pure water likely due to the simultaneously consumption of ozone by cl as the reaction proceeded ph was another important factor that influenced the ozonation process the reaction rate of cip decreased from 1 2 10 1 to 8 7 10 2 min 1 as ph increased from 5 0 to 9 0 in artificial seawater fig 2 suggesting that acidic conditions facilitated cip transformation the ph dependent reaction of cip with ozone may be attributed to several factors first the direct reaction of cip with ozone decreased as the ph increased fig 2a for instance the k obs values in reaction with pure water decreased from 4 3 10 2 min 1 to 1 4 10 2 min 1 as ph increased from 5 0 to 9 0 likely due to the fast self decomposition of ozone as ph increased grguric et al 1994 von gunten 2003 dewitte et al 1994 also found that the reaction of cip with ozone favored acidic conditions second the generation of rbs in the reaction with br also declined as ph increased from 5 0 to 9 0 fig 2b especially in the first 1 min third the reactivity of cip with rbs decreased as ph increased from 5 0 to 9 0 fig 2c for example the degradation rates decreased from 0 18 to 6 1 10 2 min 1 as ph increased from 5 0 to 9 0 similar to our finding a previous study found that the reactivity of rbs favored acidic conditions grguric et al 1994 last ph governed the species distribution of cip because cip has the first and second acid dissociations of pka1 5 9 and pka2 8 9 drakopoulos and ioannou 1997 accordingly cip mainly occurred in cationic form in ph 5 9 solutions and in anionic form in ph 8 9 solutions i e the percentage of cip species followed the order of protonated neutral deprotonated as ph increased from 5 0 to 9 0 these different ionic states of cip might affect the reactivity dodd et al 2006 and wang et al 2010 also found similar effects in the reaction of cip with ozone and chlorine dioxide 3 2 product identification a summary of the tentatively identified tps is given in table 1 and the corresponding structure of each tp is given in fig 3 overall possible tps from two major transformation pathways including oxidation and bromination were screened using suspect screening strategy gago ferrero et al 2018 a total of nine tps tp1 tp9 was identified in the ozonation of cip in pure water in contrast 26 tps including tp1 tp13 and their corresponding monobrominated compounds were identified in the ozonation of cip in artificial seawater the identification of tps is outlined below first more than 120 potential tps and their exact masses were proposed based on the ozonation of cip in pure water and artificial seawater the quasimolecular ions m h of suspected tps were derived from the centroid raw ms data of uplc qtof hrms the quasimolecular ions were then fit to the proposed tps all quasimolecular ions m h for the identified tps showed the exact mass deviations being 10 ppm table 1 furthermore the ms2 spectra and interpretation of tps were obtained and given in figs s2 s15 these results clearly suggest that the quasimolecular ions of tps derived from the hrms analysis were highly reliable on the basis of the structure of cip and the derived quasimolecular ions and ms2 product ion scan of each tp the structures of tps were proposed for most of the tps retaining cooh group the base peak of fragment ion was generally found to be m h h2o according to the diverse structures of tps other characteristic daughter ions could also be observed for each tp for example products tp1 tp4 were inferred as the products from the oxidation of cip at the piperazinyl moiety with ring cleavage the ms2 spectra of tp1 tp4 exhibited a characteristic daughter ion of at m z 217 0339 suggesting that these tps retained the skeleton analogous of 7 amino 1 cyclopropyl 6 fluoroquinolin 4 1h one figs s3 s6 moreover tp2 showed distinctive fragment ions at m z 280 9816 for the neutral loss of cyclopropene from m h and 258 0745 for the loss of conh2 from m h h2o in contrast tp3 displayed unique fragment ions at m z 268 1061 for the successive neutral losses of hf and h2o and 245 1058 for the losses of nh3 and co2 both from m h products tp5 tp9 were inferred to be products from the oxidation of cip at the piperazinyl moiety with the addition of oxygen atom or hydroxyl group to the ring the hydroxyl derivative tp5 showed a characteristic ion at m z 306 1264 indicating the loss of fragment nch2ch2 from m h however no neutral loss of hf was observed in tp5 suggesting that the substitution of oh was likely occurred at the position 3 rather than 2 in the piperazinyl ring fig s7 in contrast the dihydroxyl derivative tp6 displayed unique ions at m z 346 1213 for m h h2o hf and 303 0792 for m h h2o c2h5n suggesting that the substitution of dihydoxyl took place at the positions c2 and c3 in the piperazinyl ring fig s8 using the similar fragmentation patterns of tp1 tp4 the structures of tp7 tp9 could be easily explained unlike the other tps both tp10 and tp11 showed an obvious neutral loss of o2 in ms2 scan figs s12 and s13 for example tp10 had a characteristic ion at m z 314 0953 for m h h2o o2 while tp11 at m z 257 0706 for m h nhch2 h2o o2 this observation coincided with the structures of tp10 and tp11 that contain carboxyl or ketone groups at c2 and c3 therefore tp10 and tp11 were inferred as n formylanthranilic acid analogue in contrast tp12 and tp13 did not have the typical fragment ion of m h h2o suggesting the lack of cooh in the two tps figs s14 and s15 therefore tp12 and tp13 were inferred to be the analogue of isatin the identification of brominated tps br tps was generally based on the bromination of cip and tp1 tp13 all of the br tps showed strong quasimolecular ions m h and m 2 h with a ratio close to 1 1 suggesting that they were monobrominated compound for example br cip showed characteristic parent ions at m z 410 0524 and 412 0523 with a ratio near 1 1 the fragment ion at m z 370 1384 was likely due to the neutral loss of cyclopropene from m h similar to that observed in the ms2 scan of cip fig s2 br cip was therefore inferred as monobrominated cip using the same protocol the other br tps were tentatively identified to be monobrominated tp1 tp13 br tp1 br tp13 except br tp7 3 3 reaction pathways on the basis of the identified tps and knowledge of similar reactions the possible pathways are summarized in fig 3 overall the detected tps could be contributed to the oxidation of cip by either molecular ozone or the resulting oh and rbs via four processes oxidation at the piperazinyl moiety with the ring cleavage p i oxidation at the piperazinyl moiety with the addition of oxygen atom or hydroxyl group to the ring p ii oxidation at the quinolone moiety p iii and bromination of cip and intermediates p iv in the pathway p i the piperazine ring of cip was oxidized to release c2h2 forming desethylene cip tp3 the further oxidation of tp3 may result in either the loss of nc2h5 group to produce tp4 or the addition of an oxygen atom to form a keto derivative tp2 additional subsequent oxidation of tp2 yielded tp1 this pathway was also found in the ozonation of cip in wastewater liu et al 2012 likewise dewitte et al 2008 identified tp3 and tp4 in the ozonation of cip in pure water and proposed a similar pathway the formation of tps may also initiate from the reaction of cip with oh by introducing a hydroxyl group to the piperazinyl moiety p ii for example hydroxylation of cip produced hydroxyl derivative tp5 and dihydroxyl derivative tp6 similar to our finding tp5 and tp6 were commonly found in the oxidation of cip via other aops paul et al 2010 liu et al 2012 the hydroxyl derivatives were susceptible to oxidation by molecular ozone and produced keto derivatives of the piperazinyl ring tp7 and tp8 the further oxidation of tp8 by ozone caused the cleavage of the piperazinyl ring and formed tp9 it should be noted that tp7 could also be oxidized to tp2 while tp8 to tp1 product tp9 was previously found in the oxidation of cip by chlorine dioxide and manganese oxide zhang and huang 2005 wang et al 2010 an important observation in this study was the finding of tp10 tp13 in the ozonation of cip in the presence of br generally the oxidation of cip by molecular ozone and oh takes place at the piperazine ring p i and p ii dewitte et al 2008 liu et al 2012 however the quinolone moiety remained intact to molecular ozone while it may undergo ring cleavage by the attack of oh dewitte et al 2008 liu et al 2012 in this study only products tp1 tp9 were observed in the ozonation of cip in pure water suggesting that p i and p ii were the major pathways while p iii could be negligible even if there was any besides tp1 tp9 products tp10 tp13 were also detected in the reaction in artificial seawater this result clearly suggested that the cleavage of quinolone moiety in cip was significantly enhanced by br likely due to the formation of rbs moreover products tp1 tp13 were also observed in the direct reaction of cip with rbs therefore we proposed that the reaction of cip with rbs led to the breakage of c2 c3 bond adjacent to the carboxylic acid group forming n formylanthranilic acid analogue tp10 p iii the intermediate tp10 was not stable and was vulnerable to further conversion under oxidative conditions producing tp11 subsequent oxidation caused the intramolecular cyclization of tp11 by releasing hcooh producing an isatin analogue tp12 liu et al 2012 product tp12 may be further oxidized to tp13 via similar pathways as described before bromination was another important pathway for the ozonation of cip in the presence of br p iv as described above rbs could be readily formed when br were introduced into the reaction the resulting rbs may react with cip and tp1 tp13 for example the bromination of cip led to the formation of 8 brominated cip br cip the reaction of rbs with cip likely occurred via electrophilic substitution accordingly the negative partial charge δ in the aromatic ring of cip was susceptible to attack by the positive partial charge δ of the bromine atom in rbs march 1985 acero et al 2005 the substitution of bromine preferentially took place at the position c8 to c5 on the aromatic ring because of the electron withdrawing group f at c6 and the electron donating substituent piperazine ring at c7 acero et al 2005 a similar substitution pattern was observed in the chlorination of cip by chlorine dodd et al 2005 theoretically the other br tps may be produced either from the bromination of tp1 tp13 or from the further oxidation of br cip via similar pathways observed for cip given the complexity of pathways as the reaction proceeded we could not explicitly propose a pathway for each br tp in addition no higher brominated congeners were detected in this study suggesting that the further bromination of monobrominated tps could be neglected 3 4 residual toxicity of reaction mixture bromide in the reaction apparently enhanced the removal of toxicity toward e coli fig 4 in pure water the reaction mixture for 1 h ozonation of cip almost retained the same toxicity towards e coli as that of the parent compound cip however 50 of cip was found to be decomposed in the reaction these results together suggested that the tps in the ozonation of cip in pure water still preserved toxicity towards e coli it was reported that the antibacterial activity of cip was essentially ascribed to the quinolone moiety shen et al 1989 in addition the transformation of cip in pure water mainly occurred at piperazinyl moiety p i and p ii while the destruction of quinolone moiety p iii was not observed as described before in contrast the residual toxicity of the reaction mixture in artificial seawater decreased significantly the decrease of toxicity in artificial seawater reactions could be explained by two major reasons first br enhanced the transformation of cip and only 35 cip residue was found in the mixture after the reaction on the other hand the 65 loss of cip may partially result from the cleavage of quinolone moiety forming less toxic tps 4 conclusions this study clearly demonstrated that the ozonation of cip in water with br was significantly different from that occurred in pure water due to the formation of rbs in the former reaction compared to the reaction in pure water br in artificial seawater enhanced the reaction produced more products including br tps with higher toxicity potentials diversified pathways with the additional reaction of cip with rbs and increased the removal of residual toxicity of the reaction mixture towards e coli in view of the abundance of br in seawater and saline water these effects should be taken into consideration when ozonation is employed for the disinfection of these waters although br mostly exhibited enhancing effects on the removal of cip by ozonation in the study a more comprehensive risk assessment is necessary because of the formation of complex intermediates and the potential ecotoxicity of br tps declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

17771,in this study the performance of catalytic ozonation in the treatment of bio treated coking wastewater bcw using pilot and full scale systems was investigated additionally the removal efficiency of organic pollutants from bcw the deactivation mechanism of mnxce1 xo2 γ al2o3 and backflushing optimization for in situ catalyst regeneration which have not been previously investigated were analysed results of the 12 month pilot scale experiments showed that catalytic ozonation resulted in the effective removal of organic pollutants when backflushing was applied as an in situ catalyst regeneration strategy the effluent chemical oxygen demand cod content decreased from 150 to 78 mg l 1 and remained below a discharge limitation of 80 mg l 1 and the stable cod removal efficiencies from 56 0 to 47 9 indicated that catalyst deactivation which primarily resulted from the deposition of inorganic salts on the surface of the catalyst that limited interaction between ozone and active sites and or prevented electrons transfer was primarily inhibited by backflushing the catalyst regeneration via in situ air and water backflushing was attributed to the scrubbing collision and or the loosing effect additionally in the full scale experiment the catalytic ozonation process with in situ alternative backflushing exhibited a stable cod removal efficiency above 45 6 for 885 days when water and air flushing strengths of 10 l m 2 s 1 and 15 l m 2 s 1 respectively were applied with a 7 day regeneration interval therefore the results of this study provide new insights into catalytic ozonation and support its engineering application in bcw treatment graphical abstract image 1 keywords catalytic ozonation deactivation mechanism in situ regeneration coking wastewater alternative backflushing 1 introduction ozonation is widely used in water and wastewater treatment given that ozone has an exceptionally strong ability to degrade organic pollutants dar et al 2019 gunten 2003 sometimes its application may result in the production of compounds that are more toxic than the parent compound li et al 2008 thus it is important to identify and reduce the toxicity of effluents from ozonation process recently it was reported that catalysts can enhance ozone decomposition to yield hydroxyl radicals that have strong oxidative stability thereby improving the degradation of recalcitrant and toxic organic pollutants wu et al 2016 zhang et al 2008b zhuang et al 2014 furthermore catalytic ozonation can be conducted in ambient conditions i e without the auxiliary use of any thermal light or high pressure system huang et al 2011 therefore it can be a promising alternative to single ozonation in the field of water and wastewater treatment qu et al 2015 its application can result in the efficient removal of refractory compounds including quinoline liu et al 2019a dibutyl phthalate wang et al 2018 ibuprofen jothinathan and hu 2018 clofibric acid li et al 2019b oxalic acid beltran et al 2005 liu et al 2019b benzotriazole roshani et al 2014 and atrazine guan et al 2013 additionally it is effective in the tertiary treatment of coal gasification waste liquids zhu et al 2017 dyeing and finishing wastewater wu et al 2016 pulp and paper mill effluents fontanier et al 2006 and incineration leachates li et al 2017 however its low stability in long term operation has limited its industrial applications it is well known that the efficiency of the removal of organic pollutants using catalytic ozonation depends on the catalyst material over the past two decades numerous studies on catalytic ozonation have been conducted to investigate novel and efficient catalysts for the process ghuge and saroha 2018 thus four major categories of catalysts wang and bai 2017

catalytic ozonation processes li et al 2011 2015 shu et al 2019 mn ce o catalysts are reportedly more active than fe2o3 mnox al2o3 and cuo mnox al2o3 in the removal of phenols and in the mineralization of carboxylic acids during catalytic ozonation process for the treatment of phenolic wastewater martins and quinta ferreira 2009b although good progress has been made in the development of highly efficient catalysts for catalytic ozonation processes the practical engineering of the process for the advanced treatment of industrial wastewater has rarely been reported based on existing literature the scarcity of such studies is primarily due to the limited understanding of the stability of these catalysts under the long term operation of the catalytic ozonation process shan et al 2018 most previous studies have been limited to the investigation of the removal of one or two organic pollutants from synthetic wastewater to understand the removal mechanisms nevertheless catalyst deactivation is generally inevitable in practical applications birtill 2003 mahlaba et al 2018 sie 2001 implying that if the effective regeneration of the catalyst is not possible the engineering project cannot be operated for a long time therefore significant efforts are needed to understand the deactivation and regeneration of catalysts given that this often limits the stable operation of the process coking wastewater is a major type of industrial wastewater and its disposal poses a serious problem around the world especially in china where coal is the primary source of energy and over 1000 coke plants are distributed across the country owing to the presence of many refractory compounds conventional biological treatment processes are not efficient in the removal of the organic pollutants present in coking wastewater zhu et al 2009 and the cod values of the effluent are generally above 150 mg l 1 usually ozonation is applied to reduce the concentration of organic compounds in the effluents of biological treatment processes however the operation results of some coking wastewater treatment projects in china have shown that biological processes followed by ozonation still cannot reduce effluent cod contents to values below 80 mg l 1 as required by the emission standard of pollutants for coking chemical industry in china gb 16171 2012 however as indicated above catalytic ozonation may achieve higher cod removal efficiencies therefore catalytic ozonation is a possible alternative for the tertiary treatment of coking wastewater provided the catalyst possesses high stability for long term operation in this study the treatment of bio treated coking wastewater bcw was performed in a pilot and full scale systems using mnxce1 xo2 γ al2o3 as a catalyst the stability of the catalyst in long term operation was investigated and the catalyst deactivation mechanism as well as its regeneration method were also investigated and a new and efficient catalytic ozonation process for industrial application was proposed 2 experimental 2 1 materials and reagents analytical grade manganese nitrate and cerium nitrate hexahydrate were purchased from shanghai macklin biochemical co ltd china commercial mesoporous γ al2o3 pellets were purchased from zibo shandong province china before use these γ al2o3 pellets were washed with water and dried at 378 k for 4 h the description of the process for the preparation of the millimetric spherical mnxce1 xo2 γ al2o3 catalyst is provided in the supplementary files text s1 the mn and ce loadings measured using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes were 1 42 wt and 1 22 wt respectively bcw was supplied by a coking plant in inner mongolia china in this plant the coking wastewater is treated using a combination of physicochemical and biological treatment processes which are specifically described in the supplementary files text s2 and fig s1 2 2 experimental 2 2 1 setup of the pilot scale system pilot scale experiments were conducted in a continuous system figs s2 and s3 the reactor consisted of a cylinder column made from ss316l stainless steel with a diameter and height of 650 and 2200 mm respectively in the reactor 72 kg mnxce1 xo2 γ al2o3 catalyst was precedently loaded to a height of 0 31 m ozone was supplied by an ozone generator cf g 2 100g guolin technology co ltd china with pure oxygen as the gas source owing to its ability to yield ozone with high oxidation ability dar et al 2019 the oxygen ozone mixture was bubbled into the reactor via a 40 μm cylindrical micropore titanium plate and the ozone dosage was 80 mg l 1 h 1 while its flow rate was 0 48 m3 h 1 additionally the bcw cod content of 150 mg l 1 in a stock tank was continuously pumped into the reactor at a hydraulic retention time hrt of 90 min 2 2 2 catalytic ozonation procedure in the pilot scale experiment the pilot scale experiments consisted of two stages during the first stage there was no backflushing operation however during the second stage regular backflushing was employed to regenerate the used catalyst the backflushing operation was initiated by applying a 2 min air scour and thereafter a 10 min air water flush was adopted finally the water flush was maintained for 8 min under identical conditions a control experiment was also conducted in parallel using ozone but without the catalyst at the beginning of both stages the system was cleaned and the fresh catalyst was loaded into the system 2 2 3 catalytic testing and regeneration experiments in the semi batch scale experiments in the pilot experiments without backflushing catalyst samples were withdrawn after 12 months of operation whereas with backflushing the catalyst samples were collected after 8 and 13 months of operation respectively the three samples were marked as dc12 uc8 and uc13 respectively and their activities were tested using a semi batch reaction system text s3 and fig s4 these used catalyst samples were regenerated using two methods i e using calcination and the wash method for the first method the used catalysts uc8 uc13 and dc12 were calcined in air at a temperature of 723 k for 3 h and thereafter they were labelled huc8 huc13 and hdc12 respectively for the second method the catalysts were subjected to ultrasonic cleaning in water for 20 min and thereafter they were labelled wuc8 wuc13 and wdc12 respectively a semi batch system was also used to determine the catalytic activity of the regenerated catalysts text s3 and fig s4 2 2 4 backflushing parameter optimization and full scale application before the full scale application the backflushing parameters were optimized via the continuous pilot experiments the full scale system that was operated via an alternative backflushing mode consisted of four column reactors each having a height diameter and effective height of 9000 2800 and 7000 mm respectively figs s5 and s6 regarding this operation mode when the catalyst in one reactor needed regeneration the backflushing operation was initiated for this reactor while the other three reactors continued to operate normally owing to the pumping of the bcw before the operation of the full scale system 4526 kg of mnxce1 xo2 γ al2o3 catalyst were loaded into each reactor to a height of 1 05 m ozone was supplied using two ozone generators cf g 2 6kg guolin technology co ltd china with liquid oxygen as the gas source the oxygen ozone mixture was evenly distributed into the four reactors at a total flux and ozone dosage of 50 70 m3 h 1 and 6 4 9 0 kg h 1 respectively bcw cod content of 95 195 mg l 1 was continuously pumped into the four reactors 25 m3 h 1 for each reactor at a total flow rate of 100 m3 h 1 samples were collected every day for the analysis of cod content additionally on day 15 of operation influent and effluent samples from the full scale application system were withdrawn for three dimensional excitation emission matrix fluorescence 3deem analysis the ozone utilization efficiency δo3 δcod during the full scale application process was also calculated text s4 2 3 analytical methods the cod content of the wastewater samples were measured using the titrimetric method that employs dichromate as the oxidant in an acidic solution that was maintained at 150 c for 2 h the total organic carbon toc was monitored using an organic carbon analyzer toc l cph shimadzu japan the 3deem fluorescence of the samples was determined using a fluorometer hitachi f 7000 fl japan the concentrations of al ce and mn in the solution were detected via inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms icp ms 7700 agilent usa additionally elemental analysis was performed using an elementar instruments vario el cube germany to determine the c h n and s contents of the catalysts to quantify the loading amounts the fresh catalyst sample was digested using aqua regia 1 3 nitric acid to hydrochloric acid at a maximum temperature of 200 c and thereafter it was analysed using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes icp oes730 agilent usa the fresh used and regenerated catalysts were characterized using sem eds ftir tg dsc and bet analyses their details were provided in the text s5 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of backflushing on catalytic ozonation treatment of bcw 3 1 1 continuous pilot study with and without backflushing fig 1 shows the cod removal profiles resulting from bcw treatment in the pilot scale system in the single ozonation process the cod removal efficiencies were about 14 3 and the effluent cod contents were 128 mg l 1 which were higher than the upper limit defined by the emission standard of pollutants for coking chemical industry in china gb 16171 2012 however in the catalytic ozonation process without backflushing operation the cod removal efficiencies decreased from 56 to 14 5 within 12 month operation period and the final cod removal efficiencies were practically the same as that obtained using the single ozonation process indicating the complete deactivation of the catalyst during the catalytic oxidation process with backflushing even after 12 months of operation the cod removal efficiencies were still higher than 47 9 i e it obviously exhibited a slower decreasing trend relative to the catalytic ozonation process without backflushing operation indicating that catalyst deactivation is the main reason for the decline in cod removal efficiencies and the back flushing operation can regenerate the catalyst activity to a certain extent 3 1 2 catalytic activity of catalyst in the semi batch experiments fig 2 shows the cod and toc removal efficiencies resulting from the use of fresh used and regenerated catalysts in the semi batch experiments using the fresh catalyst the cod and toc removal efficiencies were 58 3 and 46 6 respectively comparing the results obtained from the catalytic ozonation single ozonation and adsorption experiments in the semi batch system text s6 and fig s7 showed that the removal of organic compounds from the wastewater was primarily due to catalytic ozonation and not catalyst adsorption fig s8 shows the effect of initial ph on cod removal in catalytic ozonation the cod removal efficiencies increased rapidly at first and then decreased gradually with the increase of initial ph value ranging from 2 to 11 the highest cod removal efficiency was acquired at initial ph 8 9 in bcw during catalytic ozonation considering that the ph of bcw in this study was 8 5 0 3 the initial ph value was not adjusted in the following studies using catalysts dc12 hdc12 and wdc12 the cod removal efficiencies were 14 5 16 5 and 35 5 respectively indicating that the activity of the catalysts could be partially restored by washing but not by calcination this conclusion also agreed well with toc removal efficiencies observed when these catalysts were used using catalysts uc8 and uc13 the cod removal efficiencies fig 2 obtained in the semi batch experiments were 51 0 and 46 6 respectively while the toc removal efficiencies fig 2 were 38 7 and 32 6 respectively after long term operation in the catalytic ozonation process these catalysts still possessed a relatively high activity probably suggesting that to a certain degree catalyst activity could be restored via the backflushing operation using catalysts wuc8 and wuc13 the cod removal efficiencies were 57 9 and 56 7 respectively and their activities were close to that of the fresh catalyst this observation may be related to the off line cleaning procedure associated with ultrasonic washing additionally using catalysts huc8 and huc13 the cod removal efficiencies were 51 8 and 46 9 respectively possibly indicating that as mentioned above the deactivated catalyst could be hardly regenerated via calcination the toc removal efficiencies observed when catalysts wuc8 wuc13 huc8 and huc13 were used showed that washing is a much more effective method for the regeneration of catalyst activity than calcination 3 2 mechanism of catalyst deactivation and regeneration 3 2 1 catalyst surface morphology changes the fresh catalyst pellets had a beige appearance fig s9 with size in the range of 3 5 mm fig s2 their surfaces were rich in 1 3 μm pores and were covered by closely packed globular particles with diameters 25 nm fig 3 a and b the determination of their elemental composition using eds analysis fig s10 a showed that they consisted of al mn ce and o after 12 months of operation without backflushing there was a significant change in their surface morphology catalyst dc12 was dark black fig s9 and its surface was denser fig 3 c and d a large cluster of nano sized spherical particles accumulated its surface whereas the micron sized pores disappeared the eds analysis of its surface fig s10 b showed that it primarily consisted of ca fe s and si additionally fig 3 f showed that there were more pores on the surface of catalyst wdc12 than on catalysts dc12 and hdc12 fig 3 e indicating that washing could restore the pores on the surface of the catalysts based on these findings it can be suggested that the deactivated catalyst can be regenerated by washing which restores the pores on its surface catalyst uc8 catalyst was brown in colour whereas catalyst uc13 was dark brown in colour fig s9 on the surface of catalyst uc8 spherical particles were formed and accumulated covering most of the original pores on its surface fig 3 g and h text s7 and table s1 similarly the surface of catalyst uc13 was covered by a large number of tubular flake and cubic shape crystals resulting in the disappearance of some of the original pores text s7 and table s1 and the generation of several new pores fig 3 m n 3 o and 3 p the eds analysis figs s10 d and s10 e of these crystals showed that they mainly consisted of ca s cl and fe fig 3 k l and 3 s t showed that there was a higher number of pores on the surfaces of wuc8 and wuc13 than on the surfaces of catalysts uc8 and uc13 respectively suggesting that backflushing could possibly regenerate catalyst activity via the restoration of the pores of the catalysts surface some previous studies einaga and futamura 2004 2005 have reported that carbon deposition can result in the deactivation of catalysts that can be regenerated by calcination considering these observations it is possible that in this study catalyst deactivation did not result from carbon deposition and it can be concluded calcination is not an efficient method for catalyst regeneration 3 2 2 ftir of catalyst fig 4 which represents the ftir spectra of the fresh and used catalysts shows a broad adsorption band and two weak bands the broad band in the range 3200 3600 cm 1 corresponded to the oh stretching of water and or the organic compounds adsorbed onto the catalyst surface einaga and futamura 2004 park et al 2012 the weak band at about 1637 cm 1 could be attributed to the bending vibration of the o h bond shan et al 2018 wang et al 2019 of free and or adsorbed water molecules dai et al 2014 the intensities of these two bands for the used catalyst were higher than those of the fresh catalyst indicating that the concentration of hydroxyl groups on the surface of catalysts uc8 and uc13 were higher than that of the fresh catalyst considering that the hydroxyl groups on catalyst surface are formed via the interaction between the chemisorbed water and lewis acid sites zhao et al 2014 catalysts uc8 and uc13 possibly experienced more intense interactions than the fresh catalyst compared with catalysts uc8 and uc13 catalyst dc12 did not show any intense bands around 3300 and 1637 cm 1 consistently the sem and eds results fig 3 c and d and fig s10 b show that many inorganic substances were deposited on the surface of the catalyst dc12 as a consequence some of the substances covered the hydroxyl groups on the surface of the catalyst dc12 resulting in weakening of the characteristic peaks at around 3300 and 1637 cm 1 in the ftir test in addition some of the substances also occupied the surface lewis acid sites this would limit the interaction between the chemisorbed water and lewis acid sites thereby inhibiting the formation of surface hydroxyl groups therefore catalyst dc12 did not show any intense bands around 3300 and 1637 cm 1 the weak band at around 1380 cm 1 corresponded to surface oxide species that were formed owing to the interaction between ozone and the lewis acid sites on the catalyst surface roscoe and abbatt 2005 yang et al 2010 catalyst dc12 showed no band at around 1380 cm 1 possibly due to the covering of the surface oxide species or surface lewis acid sites by the deactivated species on the surface of the catalyst combing the aforementioned results we proposed that the hydroxyl groups and the lewis acid sites on the surface of the mnxce1 xo2 γ al2o3 catalyst contribute to ozone decomposition and surface oxide species generation especially oh 3 2 3 tg dsc of catalysts fig 5 shows the simultaneous tg dsc curves of the different catalysts the tg curve of the fresh catalyst fig 5 a presented a single major mass loss within a temperature range of 25 800 c its dsc curve showed two endothermic peaks the first which appeared at about 105 c was accompanied by rapid mass losses that could be attributed to the removal of physically adsorbed water lefèvre et al 2002 and the second which emerged at about 820 c could be owed to the phase transformation from γ al2o3 to δ al2o3 and θ al2o3 jin et al 2014 additionally the tg dsc profile of catalyst dc12 showed two mass loss processes and three endothermic peaks fig 5 b initially rapid weight loss up to 16 97 was observed within temperature range of 25 800 c successively a gradual weight loss 2 8 was observed within a temperature range of 800 1000 c the characteristic dsc peaks occurring at 105 c and 240 c could be attributed to the removal of physically adsorbed water lefèvre et al 2002 and to dehydroxylation yuan et al 2019 respectively the third endothermic peak at about 815 c possibly resulted from the decomposition of inorganic substances fig 5 c and d show that the mass losses of catalysts uc8 and uc13 consisted of a two step process that fiestly occurred within a temperature range of 25 800 c and thereafter within a temperature range of 800 1000 c for catalyst uc8 these two mass losses were 9 88 and 0 97 respectively and for catalyst uc13 they were 12 67 and 0 6 respectively their total mass losses were much lower than those of catalyst dc12 suggesting that backflushing reduces the deposition of substances that can be thermally removed in addition the dsc curves of catalysts uc8 and uc13 showed an intense endothermic peaks at 55 c that was accompanied by a rapid mass loss which possibly resulted from the volatilization of the adsorbed low molecular weight organic species at about 55 c and 240 c the dsc curves of catalysts wuc8 wuc13 fig 5 e and f were evidently different from those of catalysts uc8 uc13 the characteristic peak at about 55 c was not observed in the dsc curves of catalysts wuc8 wuc13 implying that the adsorbed low molecular weight organic species could be removed via washing the intensity of the endothermic peak of catalyst wuc8 at 240 cwas higher than that of catalyst uc8 and this could be attributed to the formation of the hydroxyl groups on the surface of the washed catalyst after the removal of impurities via washing catalysts wuc13 and uc13 also exhibited a similar phenomenon considering the experimental data as well as the characterization results of sem eds ftir and tg dsc analyses it was evident that the wash method can regenerate catalyst activity via the removal impurities that occupy the active sites 3 2 4 mechanism of catalyst deactivation and regeneration several studies bartholomew 2001 forzatti and lietti 1999 have reported that catalyst deactivation during catalytic ozonation might be due to the leaching of active components and or carbon deposition in this study considering the 12 month operation the average concentrations of mn and ce leached from the catalyst were 8 35 and 0 42 μg l 1 respectively table s2 assuming a water flow rate of 400 l h 1 after three years of operation the estimated amount of mn and ce that will leach from the catalyst would be 87 78 and 4 42 g respectively relative to the amounts of these metals loaded onto the catalyst these leached amounts will be negligible therefore it can be concluded that in this study the leaching of active components did not play a major role in catalyst deactivation based on c h n and s elemental analysis table s3 a low concentration of carbon 0 311 wt was observed on the surface of catalyst uc13 tg dsc analysis also revealed that low molecular weight organic compounds were adsorbed onto the surfaces of catalysts uc8 and uc13 the absence of a carbon peak in the eds spectra of catalysts dc12 uc8 and uc13 was indicative of a low amount of carbon deposition owing to the oxidation of the organic matter adsorbed onto the catalyst surface by ozone or other active groups martins and quinta ferreira 2009a considering these results as well as the fact that the calcination method can hardly regenerate catalyst activity it can also be concluded that carbon material deposition is also not primarily responsible for catalyst deactivation in this study inorganic salt deposition which is specifically described in fig 6 was considered as the main cause of catalyst deactivation in the mnxce1 xo2 γ al2o3 catalysed ozonation process the oxidation of organic matter by radicals with high oxidation ability plays an important role in the removal of organic pollutants dar et al 2020 sun et al 2020 yao et al 2020 there are two pathways by which strong oxidative agents are produced 1 water molecules adsorbed onto the surface of the catalyst dissociate into oh and h forming the superficial hydroxyl groups that initiate ozone decomposition generating oh qi et al 2010 zhang et al 2008a 2 the transfer of electrons from surface mn3 ce3 to ozone induces the decomposition of ozone into reactive oxygen species li et al 2019a zhang et al 2015 that are maintained by the cycling reaction between mn3 ce3 and mn4 ce4 in light of the aforementioned experimental observations and several reviews of literature afzal et al 2017 2019 bing et al 2015 gunten 2003 ike et al 2019 li et al 2019a zhao et al 2009 2010 the mechanism for the production of highly oxidative agents is specifically described in both eqs 1 16 and fig 6 a 1 m n 3 c e 3 o h 2 o 3 m n 3 c e 3 o h 2 o 3 2 m n 3 c e 3 2 o h 2 4 o 3 m n 4 c e 4 2 o 2 4 h o 3 3 h o 3 h o 3 2 o h 2 o 2 4 2 o 2 h h

forming several inorganic crystals that were deposited on the surface of the catalysts initially these crystals did not bind tightly to the catalyst surface and without the backflushing operation a dense deposition layer could be gradually formed on the catalyst surface resulting in deactivation fig 6 b this could be primarily attributed to the occupation of active sites by some of the inorganic crystals which limited interaction between ozone and the active sites i e the reaction in eq 1 did not occur and or prevented electron transfer i e reaction in eq 2 eq 15 eq 16 did not occur when the inorganic crystal deposits on the catalyst surface were loose initiating backflushing resulted in three possible changes fig 6 b 1 air water flushing could directly scrub the deposited inorganic matter off the catalyst surface 2 backflushing could induce the collision of the catalyst pellets indirectly causing the deposited inorganic material to fall off 3 the impurity layer covering the catalyst surface could be loosened and such that some pores are regenerated during the backflushing process these changes may occur individually or simultaneously however they can more or less lead to the regeneration of the activities of the catalysts definitely the deposited inorganic matters including the crystals on the catalyst surface could be effectively scrubbed off by ultrasonic cleaning therefore the activity of the catalyst could be significantly regenerated by the wash method considering the eds results and sem images of uc13 fig 3 m n 3 o and 3 p figs s10 d and s10 e it could be inferred that calcification and silicification occurred on parts of the uc13 surface possibly resulting in catalyst deactivation in comparison the amorphous inorganic salts on the calcination regenerated catalysts e g huc13 were possibly transformed into crystalline oxides which could cause irreversible deactivation fig 3 q r additionally the state or structure of the deposited matter might also be changed via the calcination method for example calcination at the high temperature could cause a small part of deposited carbon to decompose or deposited matter to contract thereby producing several new pores these changes might slightly pose a positive effect on the recovery of the catalyst activity nevertheless the activity of catalyst could not be significantly regenerated by calcination 3 3 parameter optimization and full scale application of the catalytic ozonation process with backflushing given that backflushing operation can slow down inorganic salts deposition induced catalyst deactivation an alternative backflushing operation mode was adopted for the full scale catalytic ozonation process the effects of backflushing operation parameters on the performance of the catalytic ozonation process were investigated and the results are presented in fig 7 particularly fig 7 a shows an increase in air water flushing strength resulted in an increase in cod removal efficiency when the air water flushing strength was increased from 10 5 to 15 10 l m 2 s 1 there was an improvement in cod removal efficiency from 42 to 54 respectively however when the water flushing strength was further increased to 15 l m 2 s 1 there was no further improvement in cod removal efficiency in addition a high backflushing strength may result in catalyst wear and may also disturb the gravel supporting layer fig 7 b shows the effect of regeneration interval on cod removal efficiency when the regeneration interval was 7 days the decrease in cod removal efficiency was below 3 5 after 150 days of operation this value further increased to 10 and 7 5 when the regeneration intervals were set at 30 and 15 days respectively fig 8 shows the cod removal profile observed during the tertiary treatment of the bcw with the water flushing and air flushing strengths set at 10 l m 2 s 1 and 15 l m 2 s 1 respectively and with a 7 day regeneration interval under these conditions the cod removal efficiency decreased from 60 4 to 45 6 after 885 days of operation additionally the cod content of the effluent from the full scale system was always below 80 mg l 1 when the influent cod content was 95 195 mg l 1 fig s11 shows the results of the 3deem analysis of influent and effluent samples obtained from the full scale application system the 3deem fluorescence spectra of bcw showed two conspicuous peaks fig s11 a peak i was located at ex em 280 355 nm which was reported to be proteinaceous tryptophan like matter chen et al 2003 li et al 2018 peak ii was situated at ex em 330 375 nm which was related to humic acid like substance aromatic yang et al 2013 notably these two peaks were not detected in the effluent of the full scale system fig s11 b indicating the high organic matter removal efficiency of the full scale catalytic ozonation process fig s12 shows that an increase in operation time resulted in an increase in δo3 δcod ratios from 1 03 to 2 4 indicating that the ozone utilization efficiency of the full scale system showed a gradual downward trend the δo3 δcod ratios in this study were much higher than that about 0 47 reported by wei et al 2019 this may be because the coking wastewater contained some high concentration of recalcitrant pollutants or the catalyst used in this study presented lower catalytic activity than that used by wei et al 2019 therefore more study was required to further improve the catalytic activity of our catalyst as depicted in table s4 the material and preparation cost of mnxce1 xo2 γ al2o3 was 1 22 usd kg 1 and the operation cost per ton of wastewater was 0 2806 for catalytic ozonation with backflushing compared with 0 2972 without backflushing table s5 indicating that the incorporation of backflushing resulted in a decrease in operation cost owing to the increase of the services life of the catalyst these observations suggest that this system can be employed in a wide range of engineering applications 4 conclusions in this paper the performance of catalytic ozonation in the treatment of bcw with and without backflushing were compared and catalysts with different period of operation were characterized additionally the deactivation mechanism of the mnxce1 xo2 γ al2o3 catalyst was also discussed the results obtained revealed that the continuous pilot scale catalytic ozonation process for bcw treatment with backflushing showed a stable and favourable cod removal efficiency under long term operation compared with the same process without backflushing the decline in the cod removal efficiency associated with the pilot system was primarily due to the deterioration of catalyst activity the results also showed that carbon deposition was not severe owing to the oxidizing ability of ozone and the generated radicals rather the deposition of inorganic salts on the surface of the catalysts played major role in the catalyst deactivation process nevertheless the catalyst deactivation could be partially controlled by introducing in situ air and water backflushing that resulted in scrubbing collision and the loosing effect the in situ alternative backflushing operation mode involving the use of four reactors was proposed as an alternative to improve the stability and effectiveness of the catalytic ozonation process for bcw treatment the full scale system presented a stable cod removal efficiency above 45 6 following 885 days of operation and low effluent cod concentrations were observed when optimized backflushing parameters were applied therefore the catalytic ozonation process with alternative in situ backflushing appears to be a promising technique for the advanced treatment of wastewater funding this research was supported by the national natural science

17771,in this study the performance of catalytic ozonation in the treatment of bio treated coking wastewater bcw using pilot and full scale systems was investigated additionally the removal efficiency of organic pollutants from bcw the deactivation mechanism of mnxce1 xo2 γ al2o3 and backflushing optimization for in situ catalyst regeneration which have not been previously investigated were analysed results of the 12 month pilot scale experiments showed that catalytic ozonation resulted in the effective removal of organic pollutants when backflushing was applied as an in situ catalyst regeneration strategy the effluent chemical oxygen demand cod content decreased from 150 to 78 mg l 1 and remained below a discharge limitation of 80 mg l 1 and the stable cod removal efficiencies from 56 0 to 47 9 indicated that catalyst deactivation which primarily resulted from the deposition of inorganic salts on the surface of the catalyst that limited interaction between ozone and active sites and or prevented electrons transfer was primarily inhibited by backflushing the catalyst regeneration via in situ air and water backflushing was attributed to the scrubbing collision and or the loosing effect additionally in the full scale experiment the catalytic ozonation process with in situ alternative backflushing exhibited a stable cod removal efficiency above 45 6 for 885 days when water and air flushing strengths of 10 l m 2 s 1 and 15 l m 2 s 1 respectively were applied with a 7 day regeneration interval therefore the results of this study provide new insights into catalytic ozonation and support its engineering application in bcw treatment graphical abstract image 1 keywords catalytic ozonation deactivation mechanism in situ regeneration coking wastewater alternative backflushing 1 introduction ozonation is widely used in water and wastewater treatment given that ozone has an exceptionally strong ability to degrade organic pollutants dar et al 2019 gunten 2003 sometimes its application may result in the production of compounds that are more toxic than the parent compound li et al 2008 thus it is important to identify and reduce the toxicity of effluents from ozonation process recently it was reported that catalysts can enhance ozone decomposition to yield hydroxyl radicals that have strong oxidative stability thereby improving the degradation of recalcitrant and toxic organic pollutants wu et al 2016 zhang et al 2008b zhuang et al 2014 furthermore catalytic ozonation can be conducted in ambient conditions i e without the auxiliary use of any thermal light or high pressure system huang et al 2011 therefore it can be a promising alternative to single ozonation in the field of water and wastewater treatment qu et al 2015 its application can result in the efficient removal of refractory compounds including quinoline liu et al 2019a dibutyl phthalate wang et al 2018 ibuprofen jothinathan and hu 2018 clofibric acid li et al 2019b oxalic acid beltran et al 2005 liu et al 2019b benzotriazole roshani et al 2014 and atrazine guan et al 2013 additionally it is effective in the tertiary treatment of coal gasification waste liquids zhu et al 2017 dyeing and finishing wastewater wu et al 2016 pulp and paper mill effluents fontanier et al 2006 and incineration leachates li et al 2017 however its low stability in long term operation has limited its industrial applications it is well known that the efficiency of the removal of organic pollutants using catalytic ozonation depends on the catalyst material over the past two decades numerous studies on catalytic ozonation have been conducted to investigate novel and efficient catalysts for the process ghuge and saroha 2018 thus four major categories of catalysts wang and bai 2017 including 1 metal oxide based catalysts e g mno2 tio2 al2o3 and ceo2 2 supported metal metal oxide based catalysts e g cu al2o3 cu tio2 ru ceo2 co sio2 tio2 al2o3 fe2o3 al2o3 coox al2o3 and mnox zro2 3 carbon based catalyst e g gac graphene and carbon nanotube and 4 natural minerals have been studied among these different categories of catalysts supported metal metal oxide based catalysts are considered to be the most promising for industrial application owing to their high specific surface area ghuge and saroha 2018 mechanical strength wei et al 2019 excellent activity and stability peng et al 2018 al2o3 is one of the most popular catalyst supports chen et al 2015 and reportedly the dispersion of several metal oxides onto its surface can be easily performed wei et al 2019 owing to these advantages al2o3 is widely used in the field of catalysis in previous studies manganese oxide can be highly dispersed onto the surface of al2o3 to obtain an active catalyst for catalytic ozonation processes baltanás et al 1984 einaga and futamura 2004 for example the mnox al2o3 demonstrated the ability to mineralize five pharmaceutical compounds phacs in an aqueous solution yang et al 2009 it has also been demonstrated that owing to its capacity to donate or capture electrons ceria ceo2 can be used as an effective promoter to enhance the activity of the catalysts employed in catalytic ozonation processes li et al 2011 2015 shu et al 2019 mn ce o catalysts are reportedly more active than fe2o3 mnox al2o3 and cuo mnox al2o3 in the removal of phenols and in the mineralization of carboxylic acids during catalytic ozonation process for the treatment of phenolic wastewater martins and quinta ferreira 2009b although good progress has been made in the development of highly efficient catalysts for catalytic ozonation processes the practical engineering of the process for the advanced treatment of industrial wastewater has rarely been reported based on existing literature the scarcity of such studies is primarily due to the limited understanding of the stability of these catalysts under the long term operation of the catalytic ozonation process shan et al 2018 most previous studies have been limited to the investigation of the removal of one or two organic pollutants from synthetic wastewater to understand the removal mechanisms nevertheless catalyst deactivation is generally inevitable in practical applications birtill 2003 mahlaba et al 2018 sie 2001 implying that if the effective regeneration of the catalyst is not possible the engineering project cannot be operated for a long time therefore significant efforts are needed to understand the deactivation and regeneration of catalysts given that this often limits the stable operation of the process coking wastewater is a major type of industrial wastewater and its disposal poses a serious problem around the world especially in china where coal is the primary source of energy and over 1000 coke plants are distributed across the country owing to the presence of many refractory compounds conventional biological treatment processes are not efficient in the removal of the organic pollutants present in coking wastewater zhu et al 2009 and the cod values of the effluent are generally above 150 mg l 1 usually ozonation is applied to reduce the concentration of organic compounds in the effluents of biological treatment processes however the operation results of some coking wastewater treatment projects in china have shown that biological processes followed by ozonation still cannot reduce effluent cod contents to values below 80 mg l 1 as required by the emission standard of pollutants for coking chemical industry in china gb 16171 2012 however as indicated above catalytic ozonation may achieve higher cod removal efficiencies therefore catalytic ozonation is a possible alternative for the tertiary treatment of coking wastewater provided the catalyst possesses high stability for long term operation in this study the treatment of bio treated coking wastewater bcw was performed in a pilot and full scale systems using mnxce1 xo2 γ al2o3 as a catalyst the stability of the catalyst in long term operation was investigated and the catalyst deactivation mechanism as well as its regeneration method were also investigated and a new and efficient catalytic ozonation process for industrial application was proposed 2 experimental 2 1 materials and reagents analytical grade manganese nitrate and cerium nitrate hexahydrate were purchased from shanghai macklin biochemical co ltd china commercial mesoporous γ al2o3 pellets were purchased from zibo shandong province china before use these γ al2o3 pellets were washed with water and dried at 378 k for 4 h the description of the process for the preparation of the millimetric spherical mnxce1 xo2 γ al2o3 catalyst is provided in the supplementary files text s1 the mn and ce loadings measured using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes were 1 42 wt and 1 22 wt respectively bcw was supplied by a coking plant in inner mongolia china in this plant the coking wastewater is treated using a combination of physicochemical and biological treatment processes which are specifically described in the supplementary files text s2 and fig s1 2 2 experimental 2 2 1 setup of the pilot scale system pilot scale experiments were conducted in a continuous system figs s2 and s3 the reactor consisted of a cylinder column made from ss316l stainless steel with a diameter and height of 650 and 2200 mm respectively in the reactor 72 kg mnxce1 xo2 γ al2o3 catalyst was precedently loaded to a height of 0 31 m ozone was supplied by an ozone generator cf g 2 100g guolin technology co ltd china with pure oxygen as the gas source owing to its ability to yield ozone with high oxidation ability dar et al 2019 the oxygen ozone mixture was bubbled into the reactor via a 40 μm cylindrical micropore titanium plate and the ozone dosage was 80 mg l 1 h 1 while its flow rate was 0 48 m3 h 1 additionally the bcw cod content of 150 mg l 1 in a stock tank was continuously pumped into the reactor at a hydraulic retention time hrt of 90 min 2 2 2 catalytic ozonation procedure in the pilot scale experiment the pilot scale experiments consisted of two stages during the first stage there was no backflushing operation however during the second stage regular backflushing was employed to regenerate the used catalyst the backflushing operation was initiated by applying a 2 min air scour and thereafter a 10 min air water flush was adopted finally the water flush was maintained for 8 min under identical conditions a control experiment was also conducted in parallel using ozone but without the catalyst at the beginning of both stages the system was cleaned and the fresh catalyst was loaded into the system 2 2 3 catalytic testing and regeneration experiments in the semi batch scale experiments in the pilot experiments without backflushing catalyst samples were withdrawn after 12 months of operation whereas with backflushing the catalyst samples were collected after 8 and 13 months of operation respectively the three samples were marked as dc12 uc8 and uc13 respectively and their activities were tested using a semi batch reaction system text s3 and fig s4 these used catalyst samples were regenerated using two methods i e using calcination and the wash method for the first method the used catalysts uc8 uc13 and dc12 were calcined in air at a temperature of 723 k for 3 h and thereafter they were labelled huc8 huc13 and hdc12 respectively for the second method the catalysts were subjected to ultrasonic cleaning in water for 20 min and thereafter they were labelled wuc8 wuc13 and wdc12 respectively a semi batch system was also used to determine the catalytic activity of the regenerated catalysts text s3 and fig s4 2 2 4 backflushing parameter optimization and full scale application before the full scale application the backflushing parameters were optimized via the continuous pilot experiments the full scale system that was operated via an alternative backflushing mode consisted of four column reactors each having a height diameter and effective height of 9000 2800 and 7000 mm respectively figs s5 and s6 regarding this operation mode when the catalyst in one reactor needed regeneration the backflushing operation was initiated for this reactor while the other three reactors continued to operate normally owing to the pumping of the bcw before the operation of the full scale system 4526 kg of mnxce1 xo2 γ al2o3 catalyst were loaded into each reactor to a height of 1 05 m ozone was supplied using two ozone generators cf g 2 6kg guolin technology co ltd china with liquid oxygen as the gas source the oxygen ozone mixture was evenly distributed into the four reactors at a total flux and ozone dosage of 50 70 m3 h 1 and 6 4 9 0 kg h 1 respectively bcw cod content of 95 195 mg l 1 was continuously pumped into the four reactors 25 m3 h 1 for each reactor at a total flow rate of 100 m3 h 1 samples were collected every day for the analysis of cod content additionally on day 15 of operation influent and effluent samples from the full scale application system were withdrawn for three dimensional excitation emission matrix fluorescence 3deem analysis the ozone utilization efficiency δo3 δcod during the full scale application process was also calculated text s4 2 3 analytical methods the cod content of the wastewater samples were measured using the titrimetric method that employs dichromate as the oxidant in an acidic solution that was maintained at 150 c for 2 h the total organic carbon toc was monitored using an organic carbon analyzer toc l cph shimadzu japan the 3deem fluorescence of the samples was determined using a fluorometer hitachi f 7000 fl japan the concentrations of al ce and mn in the solution were detected via inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms icp ms 7700 agilent usa additionally elemental analysis was performed using an elementar instruments vario el cube germany to determine the c h n and s contents of the catalysts to quantify the loading amounts the fresh catalyst sample was digested using aqua regia 1 3 nitric acid to hydrochloric acid at a maximum temperature of 200 c and thereafter it was analysed using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes icp oes730 agilent usa the fresh used and regenerated catalysts were characterized using sem eds ftir tg dsc and bet analyses their details were provided in the text s5 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of backflushing on catalytic ozonation treatment of bcw 3 1 1 continuous pilot study with and without backflushing fig 1 shows the cod removal profiles resulting from bcw treatment in the pilot scale system in the single ozonation process the cod removal efficiencies were about 14 3 and the effluent cod contents were 128 mg l 1 which were higher than the upper limit defined by the emission standard of pollutants for coking chemical industry in china gb 16171 2012 however in the catalytic ozonation process without backflushing operation the cod removal efficiencies decreased from 56 to 14 5 within 12 month operation period and the final cod removal efficiencies were practically the same as that obtained using the single ozonation process indicating the complete deactivation of the catalyst during the catalytic oxidation process with backflushing even after 12 months of operation the cod removal efficiencies were still higher than 47 9 i e it obviously exhibited a slower decreasing trend relative to the catalytic ozonation process without backflushing operation indicating that catalyst deactivation is the main reason for the decline in cod removal efficiencies and the back flushing operation can regenerate the catalyst activity to a certain extent 3 1 2 catalytic activity of catalyst in the semi batch experiments fig 2 shows the cod and toc removal efficiencies resulting from the use of fresh used and regenerated catalysts in the semi batch experiments using the fresh catalyst the cod and toc removal efficiencies were 58 3 and 46 6 respectively comparing the results obtained from the catalytic ozonation single ozonation and adsorption experiments in the semi batch system text s6 and fig s7 showed that the removal of organic compounds from the wastewater was primarily due to catalytic ozonation and not catalyst adsorption fig s8 shows the effect of initial ph on cod removal in catalytic ozonation the cod removal efficiencies increased rapidly at first and then decreased gradually with the increase of initial ph value ranging from 2 to 11 the highest cod removal efficiency was acquired at initial ph 8 9 in bcw during catalytic ozonation considering that the ph of bcw in this study was 8 5 0 3 the initial ph value was not adjusted in the following studies using catalysts dc12 hdc12 and wdc12 the cod removal efficiencies were 14 5 16 5 and 35 5 respectively indicating that the activity of the catalysts could be partially restored by washing but not by calcination this conclusion also agreed well with toc removal efficiencies observed when these catalysts were used using catalysts uc8 and uc13 the cod removal efficiencies fig 2 obtained in the semi batch experiments were 51 0 and 46 6 respectively while the toc removal efficiencies fig 2 were 38 7 and 32 6 respectively after long term operation in the catalytic ozonation process these catalysts still possessed a relatively high activity probably suggesting that to a certain degree catalyst activity could be restored via the backflushing operation using catalysts wuc8 and wuc13 the cod removal efficiencies were 57 9 and 56 7 respectively and their activities were close to that of the fresh catalyst this observation may be related to the off line cleaning procedure associated with ultrasonic washing additionally using catalysts huc8 and huc13 the cod removal efficiencies were 51 8 and 46 9 respectively possibly indicating that as mentioned above the deactivated catalyst could be hardly regenerated via calcination the toc removal efficiencies observed when catalysts wuc8 wuc13 huc8 and huc13 were used showed that washing is a much more effective method for the regeneration of catalyst activity than calcination 3 2 mechanism of catalyst deactivation and regeneration 3 2 1 catalyst surface morphology changes the fresh catalyst pellets had a beige appearance fig s9 with size in the range of 3 5 mm fig s2 their surfaces were rich in 1 3 μm pores and were covered by closely packed globular particles with diameters 25 nm fig 3 a and b the determination of their elemental composition using eds analysis fig s10 a showed that they consisted of al mn ce and o after 12 months of operation without backflushing there was a significant change in their surface morphology catalyst dc12 was dark black fig s9 and its surface was denser fig 3 c and d a large cluster of nano sized spherical particles accumulated its surface whereas the micron sized pores disappeared the eds analysis of its surface fig s10 b showed that it primarily consisted of ca fe s and si additionally fig 3 f showed that there were more pores on the surface of catalyst wdc12 than on catalysts dc12 and hdc12 fig 3 e indicating that washing could restore the pores on the surface of the catalysts based on these findings it can be suggested that the deactivated catalyst can be regenerated by washing which restores the pores on its surface catalyst uc8 catalyst was brown in colour whereas catalyst uc13 was dark brown in colour fig s9 on the surface of catalyst uc8 spherical particles were formed and accumulated covering most of the original pores on its surface fig 3 g and h text s7 and table s1 similarly the surface of catalyst uc13 was covered by a large number of tubular flake and cubic shape crystals resulting in the disappearance of some of the original pores text s7 and table s1 and the generation of several new pores fig 3 m n 3 o and 3 p the eds analysis figs s10 d and s10 e of these crystals showed that they mainly consisted of ca s cl and fe fig 3 k l and 3 s t showed that there was a higher number of pores on the surfaces of wuc8 and wuc13 than on the surfaces of catalysts uc8 and uc13 respectively suggesting that backflushing could possibly regenerate catalyst activity via the restoration of the pores of the catalysts surface some previous studies einaga and futamura 2004 2005 have reported that carbon deposition can result in the deactivation of catalysts that can be regenerated by calcination considering these observations it is possible that in this study catalyst deactivation did not result from carbon deposition and it can be concluded calcination is not an efficient method for catalyst regeneration 3 2 2 ftir of catalyst fig 4 which represents the ftir spectra of the fresh and used catalysts shows a broad adsorption band and two weak bands the broad band in the range 3200 3600 cm 1 corresponded to the oh stretching of water and or the organic compounds adsorbed onto the catalyst surface einaga and futamura 2004 park et al 2012 the weak band at about 1637 cm 1 could be attributed to the bending vibration of the o h bond shan et al 2018 wang et al 2019 of free and or adsorbed water molecules dai et al 2014 the intensities of these two bands for the used catalyst were higher than those of the fresh catalyst indicating that the concentration of hydroxyl groups on the surface of catalysts uc8 and uc13 were higher than that of the fresh catalyst considering that the hydroxyl groups on catalyst surface are formed via the interaction between the chemisorbed water and lewis acid sites zhao et al 2014 catalysts uc8 and uc13 possibly experienced more intense interactions than the fresh catalyst compared with catalysts uc8 and uc13 catalyst dc12 did not show any intense bands around 3300 and 1637 cm 1 consistently the sem and eds results fig 3 c and d and fig s10 b show that many inorganic substances were deposited on the surface of the catalyst dc12 as a consequence some of the substances covered the hydroxyl groups on the surface of the catalyst dc12 resulting in weakening of the characteristic peaks at around 3300 and 1637 cm 1 in the ftir test in addition some of the substances also occupied the surface lewis acid sites this would limit the interaction between the chemisorbed water and lewis acid sites thereby inhibiting the formation of surface hydroxyl groups therefore catalyst dc12 did not show any intense bands around 3300 and 1637 cm 1 the weak band at around 1380 cm 1 corresponded to surface oxide species that were formed owing to the interaction between ozone and the lewis acid sites on the catalyst surface roscoe and abbatt 2005 yang et al 2010 catalyst dc12 showed no band at around 1380 cm 1 possibly due to the covering of the surface oxide species or surface lewis acid sites by the deactivated species on the surface of the catalyst combing the aforementioned results we proposed that the hydroxyl groups and the lewis acid sites on the surface of the mnxce1 xo2 γ al2o3 catalyst contribute to ozone decomposition and surface oxide species generation especially oh 3 2 3 tg dsc of catalysts fig 5 shows the simultaneous tg dsc curves of the different catalysts the tg curve of the fresh catalyst fig 5 a presented a single major mass loss within a temperature range of 25 800 c its dsc curve showed two endothermic peaks the first which appeared at about 105 c was accompanied by rapid mass losses that could be attributed to the removal of physically adsorbed water lefèvre et al 2002 and the second which emerged at about 820 c could be owed to the phase transformation from γ al2o3 to δ al2o3 and θ al2o3 jin et al 2014 additionally the tg dsc profile of catalyst dc12 showed two mass loss processes and three endothermic peaks fig 5 b initially rapid weight loss up to 16 97 was observed within temperature range of 25 800 c successively a gradual weight loss 2 8 was observed within a temperature range of 800 1000 c the characteristic dsc peaks occurring at 105 c and 240 c could be attributed to the removal of physically adsorbed water lefèvre et al 2002 and to dehydroxylation yuan et al 2019 respectively the third endothermic peak at about 815 c possibly resulted from the decomposition of inorganic substances fig 5 c and d show that the mass losses of catalysts uc8 and uc13 consisted of a two step process that fiestly occurred within a temperature range of 25 800 c and thereafter within a temperature range of 800 1000 c for catalyst uc8 these two mass losses were 9 88 and 0 97 respectively and for catalyst uc13 they were 12 67 and 0 6 respectively their total mass losses were much lower than those of catalyst dc12 suggesting that backflushing reduces the deposition of substances that can be thermally removed in addition the dsc curves of catalysts uc8 and uc13 showed an intense endothermic peaks at 55 c that was accompanied by a rapid mass loss which possibly resulted from the volatilization of the adsorbed low molecular weight organic species at about 55 c and 240 c the dsc curves of catalysts wuc8 wuc13 fig 5 e and f were evidently different from those of catalysts uc8 uc13 the characteristic peak at about 55 c was not observed in the dsc curves of catalysts wuc8 wuc13 implying that the adsorbed low molecular weight organic species could be removed via washing the intensity of the endothermic peak of catalyst wuc8 at 240 cwas higher than that of catalyst uc8 and this could be attributed to the formation of the hydroxyl groups on the surface of the washed catalyst after the removal of impurities via washing catalysts wuc13 and uc13 also exhibited a similar phenomenon considering the experimental data as well as the characterization results of sem eds ftir and tg dsc analyses it was evident that the wash method can regenerate catalyst activity via the removal impurities that occupy the active sites 3 2 4 mechanism of catalyst deactivation and regeneration several studies bartholomew 2001 forzatti and lietti 1999 have reported that catalyst deactivation during catalytic ozonation might be due to the leaching of active components and or carbon deposition in this study considering the 12 month operation the average concentrations of mn and ce leached from the catalyst were 8 35 and 0 42 μg l 1 respectively table s2 assuming a water flow rate of 400 l h 1 after three years of operation the estimated amount of mn and ce that will leach from the catalyst would be 87 78 and 4 42 g respectively relative to the amounts of these metals loaded onto the catalyst these leached amounts will be negligible therefore it can be concluded that in this study the leaching of active components did not play a major role in catalyst deactivation based on c h n and s elemental analysis table s3 a low concentration of carbon 0 311 wt was observed on the surface of catalyst uc13 tg dsc analysis also revealed that low molecular weight organic compounds were adsorbed onto the surfaces of catalysts uc8 and uc13 the absence of a carbon peak in the eds spectra of catalysts dc12 uc8 and uc13 was indicative of a low amount of carbon deposition owing to the oxidation of the organic matter adsorbed onto the catalyst surface by ozone or other active groups martins and quinta ferreira 2009a considering these results as well as the fact that the calcination method can hardly regenerate catalyst activity it can also be concluded that carbon material deposition is also not primarily responsible for catalyst deactivation in this study inorganic salt deposition which is specifically described in fig 6 was considered as the main cause of catalyst deactivation in the mnxce1 xo2 γ al2o3 catalysed ozonation process the oxidation of organic matter by radicals with high oxidation ability plays an important role in the removal of organic pollutants dar et al 2020 sun et al 2020 yao et al 2020 there are two pathways by which strong oxidative agents are produced 1 water molecules adsorbed onto the surface of the catalyst dissociate into oh and h forming the superficial hydroxyl groups that initiate ozone decomposition generating oh qi et al 2010 zhang et al 2008a 2 the transfer of electrons from surface mn3 ce3 to ozone induces the decomposition of ozone into reactive oxygen species li et al 2019a zhang et al 2015 that are maintained by the cycling reaction between mn3 ce3 and mn4 ce4 in light of the aforementioned experimental observations and several reviews of literature afzal et al 2017 2019 bing et al 2015 gunten 2003 ike et al 2019 li et al 2019a zhao et al 2009 2010 the mechanism for the production of highly oxidative agents is specifically described in both eqs 1 16 and fig 6 a 1 m n 3 c e 3 o h 2 o 3 m n 3 c e 3 o h 2 o 3 2 m n 3 c e 3 2 o h 2 4 o 3 m n 4 c e 4 2 o 2 4 h o 3 3 h o 3 h o 3 2 o h 2 o 2 4 2 o 2 h h

forming several inorganic crystals that were deposited on the surface of the catalysts initially these crystals did not bind tightly to the catalyst surface and without the backflushing operation a dense deposition layer could be gradually formed on the catalyst surface resulting in deactivation fig 6 b this could be primarily attributed to the occupation of active sites by some of the inorganic crystals which limited interaction between ozone and the active sites i e the reaction in eq 1 did not occur and or prevented electron transfer i e reaction in eq 2 eq 15 eq 16 did not occur when the inorganic crystal deposits on the catalyst surface were loose initiating backflushing resulted in three possible changes fig 6 b 1 air water flushing could directly scrub the deposited inorganic matter off the catalyst surface 2 backflushing could induce the collision of the catalyst pellets indirectly causing the deposited inorganic material to fall off 3 the impurity layer covering the catalyst surface could be loosened and such that some pores are regenerated during the backflushing process these changes may occur individually or simultaneously however they can more or less lead to the regeneration of the activities of the catalysts definitely the deposited inorganic matters including the crystals on the catalyst surface could be effectively scrubbed off by ultrasonic cleaning therefore the activity of the catalyst could be significantly regenerated by the wash method considering the eds results and sem images of uc13 fig 3 m n 3 o and 3 p figs s10 d and s10 e it could be inferred that calcification and silicification occurred on parts of the uc13 surface possibly resulting in catalyst deactivation in comparison the amorphous inorganic salts on the calcination regenerated catalysts e g huc13 were possibly transformed into crystalline oxides which could cause irreversible deactivation fig 3 q r additionally the state or structure of the deposited matter might also be changed via the calcination method for example calcination at the high temperature could cause a small part of deposited carbon to decompose or deposited matter to contract thereby producing several new pores these changes might slightly pose a positive effect on the recovery of the catalyst activity nevertheless the activity of catalyst could not be significantly regenerated by calcination 3 3 parameter optimization and full scale application of the catalytic ozonation process with backflushing given that backflushing operation can slow down inorganic salts deposition induced catalyst deactivation an alternative backflushing operation mode was adopted for the full scale catalytic ozonation process the effects of backflushing operation parameters on the performance of the catalytic ozonation process were investigated and the results are presented in fig 7 particularly fig 7 a shows an increase in air water flushing strength resulted in an increase in cod removal efficiency when the air water flushing strength was increased from 10 5 to 15 10 l m 2 s 1 there was an improvement in cod removal efficiency from 42 to 54 respectively however when the water flushing strength was further increased to 15 l m 2 s 1 there was no further improvement in cod removal efficiency in addition a high backflushing strength may result in catalyst wear and may also disturb the gravel supporting layer fig 7 b shows the effect of regeneration interval on cod removal efficiency when the regeneration interval was 7 days the decrease in cod removal efficiency was below 3 5 after 150 days of operation this value further increased to 10 and 7 5 when the regeneration intervals were set at 30 and 15 days respectively fig 8 shows the cod removal profile observed during the tertiary treatment of the bcw with the water flushing and air flushing strengths set at 10 l m 2 s 1 and 15 l m 2 s 1 respectively and with a 7 day regeneration interval under these conditions the cod removal efficiency decreased from 60 4 to 45 6 after 885 days of operation additionally the cod content of the effluent from the full scale system was always below 80 mg l 1 when the influent cod content was 95 195 mg l 1 fig s11 shows the results of the 3deem analysis of influent and effluent samples obtained from the full scale application system the 3deem fluorescence spectra of bcw showed two conspicuous peaks fig s11 a peak i was located at ex em 280 355 nm which was reported to be proteinaceous tryptophan like matter chen et al 2003 li et al 2018 peak ii was situated at ex em 330 375 nm which was related to humic acid like substance aromatic yang et al 2013 notably these two peaks were not detected in the effluent of the full scale system fig s11 b indicating the high organic matter removal efficiency of the full scale catalytic ozonation process fig s12 shows that an increase in operation time resulted in an increase in δo3 δcod ratios from 1 03 to 2 4 indicating that the ozone utilization efficiency of the full scale system showed a gradual downward trend the δo3 δcod ratios in this study were much higher than that about 0 47 reported by wei et al 2019 this may be because the coking wastewater contained some high concentration of recalcitrant pollutants or the catalyst used in this study presented lower catalytic activity than that used by wei et al 2019 therefore more study was required to further improve the catalytic activity of our catalyst as depicted in table s4 the material and preparation cost of mnxce1 xo2 γ al2o3 was 1 22 usd kg 1 and the operation cost per ton of wastewater was 0 2806 for catalytic ozonation with backflushing compared with 0 2972 without backflushing table s5 indicating that the incorporation of backflushing resulted in a decrease in operation cost owing to the increase of the services life of the catalyst these observations suggest that this system can be employed in a wide range of engineering applications 4 conclusions in this paper the performance of catalytic ozonation in the treatment of bcw with and without backflushing were compared and catalysts with different period of operation were characterized additionally the deactivation mechanism of the mnxce1 xo2 γ al2o3 catalyst was also discussed the results obtained revealed that the continuous pilot scale catalytic ozonation process for bcw treatment with backflushing showed a stable and favourable cod removal efficiency under long term operation compared with the same process without backflushing the decline in the cod removal efficiency associated with the pilot system was primarily due to the deterioration of catalyst activity the results also showed that carbon deposition was not severe owing to the oxidizing ability of ozone and the generated radicals rather the deposition of inorganic salts on the surface of the catalysts played major role in the catalyst deactivation process nevertheless the catalyst deactivation could be partially controlled by introducing in situ air and water backflushing that resulted in scrubbing collision and the loosing effect the in situ alternative backflushing operation mode involving the use of four reactors was proposed as an alternative to improve the stability and effectiveness of the catalytic ozonation process for bcw treatment the full scale system presented a stable cod removal efficiency above 45 6 following 885 days of operation and low effluent cod concentrations were observed when optimized backflushing parameters were applied therefore the catalytic ozonation process with alternative in situ backflushing appears to be a promising technique for the advanced treatment of wastewater funding this research was supported by the national natural science

17772,photocatalytic water treatment has significant potential to disinfect and degrade recalcitrant organic pollutants while minimizing the need to add chemicals but current approaches have poor energy efficiency due in part to inefficient utilization of photo generated reactive oxygen species ros organic coatings such as cyclodextrin cd can adsorb target contaminants and bring them close to the photocatalyst surface to enhance ros utilization efficiency but the coatings themselves are susceptible to ros attack here we report an ros resistant fluorinated cd polymer cdp that can both adsorb contaminants and resist degradation by ros yielding a more efficient material for trap and zap water treatment we produced the cdp through condensation polymerization of β cyclodextrin and tetrafluoroterephthalonitrile resulting in a cross linked covalently bound cd film that is much more stable than prior approaches involving physi sorption we optimized the coating thickness on tio2 microspheres to improve the efficiency of contaminant degradation and found that increasing the cdp content enhanced bpa adsorption but also occluded photocatalytic sites and hindered photocatalytic

scientific instrument thermogravimetric analysis tga was performed on sdt q600 ta instruments at a heating rate of 10 c min from room temperature to 700 c with a flowing air gas stream of 50 ml min 1 the materials were analyzed by measuring the n2 adsorption isotherms at 196 c using the surface analyzer instrument autosorb 3b quantachrome the samples were degassed at 100 c during 12 h before the analysis the specific surface area was calculated using the brunauer emmett teller bet equation and the pore size distribution was calculated using the barret joyner halenda bjh method 2 5 bpa adsorption tests the catalyst 20 mg was dispersed into 40 ml solution with an initial bpa concentration of 20 mg l 1 aliquots 200 μl were taken at predetermined time intervals and the remaining bpa in the solution was analyzed to obtain the adsorption kinetics the bpa concentration was determined by hplc lc 20at shimadzu chromatography equipped with a uv vis detector a dc18 reverse phase column atlantis 3 μm 3 9 15 mm waters was used for separation with acetonitrile water 60 40 v v at a flow rate of 1 ml min 1 the detection and quantification limits of bpa analysis were 1 and 10 μg l 1 respectively the amount of bpa adsorbed was calculated using the equation qe ci ce v m where qe is the adsorbate amount adsorbed on the adsorbent at equilibrium mg g 1 ci is the initial concentration in water mg l 1 ce is the final equilibrium concentration in water mg l 1 v is the solution volume l and m is the mass of the adsorbent g to characterize adsorption kinetics time course data were fit to a pseudo second order kinetic model which considers a two step adsorption process involving solute diffusion through the adsorbent and then chemical sorption as the rate limiting step ho and mckay 1999 adsorption of solutes to complex materials with abundant and diverse adsorption sites tends to follow pseudo second order kinetics wang and guo 2020 where the rate of change in the amount

the equilibrium concentration of bpa was analyzed after 24 h 2 6 photocatalytic degradation of bpa and evaluation on catalyst stability the photocatalytic activity of the cdp tio2 was tested in a batch system with six uva lamps 365 nm 4 w f4t5 blb irradiation the photon flux was 3 83 10 6 e l 1s 1 measured by actinometry bolton et al 2011 uva light 365 nm was used for irradiation considering that higher energy uvc which is primarily used for disinfection is easily absorbed by organics resulting in inefficient utilization and potential deterioration of some materials phong and hur 2016 the catalyst 20 mg was dispersed into 40 ml bpa solution 20 mg l 1 in a quartz beaker although higher bpa concentrations have been reported in some industrial effluent chou et al 2014 lee et al 2015 this initial bpa concentration is relatively high compared to those commonly found in municipal secondary effluent which rarely exceed a few μg l 1 hu et al 2019 spataro et al 2019 nevertheless it facilitated chemical analysis to characterize sorption and degradation processes and served to demonstrate proof of concept under more challenging treatment conditions i e relatively high bpa concentrations ahmed et al 2011 saadati et al 2016 aliquots 1 ml were taken after predetermined intervals of irradiation time and the catalysts were filtered out using 0 22 μm ptfe syringe filter photocatalytic degradation tests of bpa were conducted in the context of deionized water or a secondary effluent polishing from a treatment plant the performance of cdp tio2 was benchmarked against p25 in secondary effluent for four treatment cycles 3 h per cycle after each cycle the solid was separated by centrifugation photocatalysis by products were identified by hplc ms in a microtof bruker equipped with an esi source and interfaced with an agilent 1200 hplc a c18 column imtakt sherzo sm c18 3 μm 150 mm 2 mm was used for separation with acetonitrile water both buffered with 0 1 of formic acid as the mobile phase a gradient method was applied to mobile phase started with 2 acetonitrile and maintained for 5 min then increased the ratio of acetonitrile to 50 in 10 min and maintained for 10 min and decreased to 2 acetonitrile in 5 min the potential destruction of cdp coating after repeated usage was determined by measuring the total organic carbon toc in the cdp tio2 material dispersion after 100 h irradiation under the same conditions as the photocatalysis experiments the catalyst was separated by centrifugation and the toc was measured by toc vchs shimadzu the stability of cdp tio2 was evaluated through repeated usage for 1000 h in detail 20 mg of cdp tio2 was dispersed into 40 ml of bpa 20 mg l 1 solution and kept irradiation for 1000 h the catalyst was collected by centrifugation at specific time intervals i e 100 200 400 600 800 and 1000 h to evaluate its long term performance on bpa removal 3 results and discussion 3 1 preparation of cross linked fluorinated cyclodextrin polymer coating with resistance to ros oxidation we prepared a fluorinated cross linked cd polymer cdp coating anchored to the surface of tio2 microspheres to enable contaminant sorption near photocatalytic sites and improve stability in the presence of ros the cdp coating was prepared though condensation polymerization of β cyclodextrin and tetrafluoroterephthalonitrile as previously reported alsbaiee et al 2016 although we prepared it in a relatively simple batch reaction step separately tio2 microsphere photocatalysts were prepared via a hydrothermal method as previously reported zhang et al 2018 to anchor the cdp onto the tio2 microsphere surface the cdp and tio2 were dispersed in water in the presence of cyanamide the resulting materials were washed extensively to remove unattached cdp this general procedure enables us to tune the amount of cdp coating present on the tio2 microspheres and we prepared cdp tio2 microspheres with varying amounts of cdp coatings the materials were labeled according to the weight percentage of cdp anchored cdp 3 tio2 cdp 5 tio2 and cdp 30 tio2 as determined by thermogravimetric analysis tga the resulting cdp tio2 particles were characterized in terms of morphology surface chemistry and pore structure the sem images of cdp 5 tio2 fig 1 a showed a hierarchichally structured surface and constituent nanosheets the diameter of cdp 5 tio2 was in the range of 3 5 μm successful anchoring of cdp was confirmed through ftir analysis fig 1b three bands at 2929 cm 1 1157 cm 1 and 1029 cm 1 were identified from the spectra of cdp tio2 which represent c h stretch c o stretch of cyclodextrin and the o c o antisymmetric glycosidic vibrational modes respectively wang et al 2019 the signals observed at 1320 1484 and 1675 cm 1 correspond to c f stretch c c aromatic stretch and cn nitrile stretch respectively cdp 5 tio2 had a bet surface area of 197 2 m2 g 1 which was three times higher than commercial tio2 evonik p25 58 9 m2 g 1 table s1 the specific surface decreased as the content of cdp increased table s1 this was expected because the specific area of cdp 3 8 m2 g 1 is much lower than that for bare tio2 microspheres 208 9 m2 g 1 the cdp tio2 has similar textural characteristics to bare tio2 microspheres both having the same isotherm and hysteresis loop type and an average pore size between 3 and 11 nm fig s1 and table s1 the nitrogen adsorption isotherms for these particles are of type ii fig 1d which indicates the formation of nonporous or macroporous structure thommes et al 2015 3 2 improved bpa adsorption capacity after cdp anchoring relative to bare and cyclodextrin coated tio2 microspheres next we studied the potential for the cdp nanoparticles to uptake bpa in water through adsorption tests compared with bare tio2 microspheres and cd tio2 cdp coating significantly enhanced the bpa adsorption rate and capacity and this is reflected in the adsorption kinetics data fig 2 a the pseudo second order model produced an excellent fit of the adsorption kinetics data equation 2 this fit was superior than that from a pseudo first order kinetics model based on pearson s chi squared test fig s2a and s2b the second order model parameters for each microsphere tested are provided in table s2 and show that the adsorption rate of cdp 5 tio2 was two times higher than that of cd tio2 and four times higher than that of bare tio2 microspheres table s2 the adsorption isotherms also showed that the adsorption capacity increased with increasing content of cdp fig 2b even though the specific surface area decreased as the content of coated cdp increased table s1 the adsorption isotherm for all microspheres exhibited a plateau above 50 mg g 1 with the exception of cdp 30 tio2 in which the amount of bpa adsorbed increased monotonically up to the highest concentration tested 200 mg g 1 the adsorption isotherm of the cdp 30 tio2 material were best fit by the freundlich model in which the adsorption capacity increase exponentially with the initial concentration in contrast all other materials followed the langmuir model al ghouti and da ana 2020 this likely reflects a shift from monolayered adsorption pattern described by the langmuir isotherm to multi layered adsorption described by the freundlich isotherm consistent with the apparent formation of multi layer cdp coating on the tio2 surface when increasing cdp loading the adsorption parameters are shown in table 1 and show that the cdp tio2 microspheres have higher adsorption capacities than bare tio2 or cd tio2 microspheres 3 3 enhanced photocatalytic degradation of bpa after cdp coating relative to bare and cyclodextrin coated tio2 microspheres next we tested the effectiveness of cdp tio2 for the photocatalytic degradation of bpa photocatalytic degradation of bpa was tested with different catalysts in di water to evaluate the effect of cdp coating on photoactivity without confounding effects by background ros scavengers fig s3 the photocatalytic degradation data followed pseudo first order kinetics fig s3 the rate constant for bpa degradation table s3 by cdp 5 tio2 0 025 0 002 min 1 was 1 7 times higher than that for bare tio2 microspheres 0 015 0 001 min 1 and similar to that previously reported for cd tio2 0 025 0 001 min 1 zhang et al 2018 next we tested the performance of the microspheres in the presence of competing species effluent organic matter efom is present in secondary effluent and competes with bpa for cdp sorption sites occludes the photocatalytic surface and scavenges photogenerated ros photocatalytic degradation tests on bpa with cdp tio2 were conducted in secondary effluent toc 8 64 0 25 mg l 1 ph 7 2 from a local wastewater treatment plant 69th st wastewater treatment complex of houston tx fig 3 while cdp tio2 particles removed 99 8 of bpa within 2 h when tested in di water only 80 2 of bpa was degraded after 3 h treatment in secondary effluent in addition cdp 5 tio2 showed progressive loss of photoactivity in cycling tests in secondary effluent with bpa removal decreasing to 71 7 by the fourth cycle nevertheless this decrease in performance was not as significant as observed for either cd tio2 or p25 which removed only 29 8 and 6 2 bpa by the fourth cycle in secondary effluent respectively fig 3 these results demonstrate that cdp tio2 is less susceptible to inhibition by competing species compared with cd tio2 or p25 we attribute this to the greater adsorption rate and capacity for these nanoparticles additionally p25 readily aggregates in the presence of multivalent ions such as ca2 katz et al 2015 and the average particle size table s4 increased from 300 4 nm in di water to 800 12 nm in secondary effluent which leads to decreased surface area and photoactivity in contrast aggregation of cdp tio2 was insignificant zhang et al 2018 zhao et al 2018 the average particle size of cdp tio2 in either di water tables s4 3 62 0 4 μm or in secondary effluent 3 89 0 6 μm determined by dls was statistically undistinguishable and similar to the sem observation 3 5 μm tio2 microspheres with various amounts of cdp coating were tested in di water to optimize the extent of surface modification fig 4 a bpa adsorption increased with cdp content but the rate constants of photocatalytic degradation of bpa exhibited a bell shaped pattern as a function of cdp content fig 4b specifically photocatalytic degradation rate increased with polymer content up to 5 the degradation rate constant k was 0 023 0 001 min 1 for cdp 3 tio2 and 0 025 0 002 min 1 for cdp 5 tio2 however further increases in the cdp content had a detrimental effect on bpa degradation efficiency the degradation rate constant for cdp 30 tio2 was 0 014 0 003 min 1 we attribute this increase in degradation rate followed by a decrease at higher cdp contents to an increase in adsorption capacity with increasing cdp but also higher probability for occlusion of photocatalytic sites on the tio2 surface by the polymer furthermore cdp is fluorescent under uva irradiation fig s4 and may compete with the tio2 surface for photons based on ion chromatographic analysis fig s5 the production of radicals oh was the primary mechanism to destroy bpa by photocatalysis leading to the formation of the hydroxylated compounds showed in table s5 the most abundant compound was the bpa o catechol formed from the addition of an oh group onto the aromatic ring of the bpa the identified compounds from the ion chromatograph shown in fig s5 coincide with some byproducts reported in the fenton process molkenthin et al 2013 mu et al 2017 yang et al 2016 zhang et al 2014 zheng et al 2018 3 4 stability considerations the cdp coating was significantly more stable than the baseline cd coating previously reported zhang et al 2018 we monitored the stability of cdp 5 tio2 nanoparticles under irradiation in clean di water by measuring the toc 0 55 0 01 mg l 1 and only 2 4 wt of the cdp coating was released as dissolved toc after 100 h of irradiation photocatalytic durability was enhanced compared with cd tio2 which after 500 h of irradiation experienced 70 degradation or detachment of cd zhang et al 2018 the cdp 5 tio2 photocatalytic nanoparticles remained stable and active under long term irradiation no significant loss of photoactivity was observed after 1000 h the rate constant decreased slightly from 0 027 0 002 min 1 for unexposed cdp 5 tio2 to 0 024 0 001 min 1 for cdp 5 tio2 fig 5 in contrast significant loss of activity was observed for cd tio2 after 400 h usage these results demonstrate significant photocatalytic stability for cdp tio2 nanoparticles providing a potential route to more practical photocatalytic applications 4 conclusions a novel ros resistant fluorinated cyclodextrin polymer was used as a coating for tio2 microspheres and provided superior photoactivity and durability benchmarked against cd tio2 and commercial p25 the cdp tio2 microspheres are promising multifunctional catalysts for advanced water treatment that enable a trap and zap treatment approach and are more resistant than p25 tio2 to interference by background constituents in a secondary effluent polishing context furthermore the coated cdp microspheres exhibit minor photoactivity loss after 1000 h of continuous use whereas significant loss of activity was observed for cd tio2 after 400 h usage under similar conditions finally the size of the cdp tio2 enables separation by low pressure filtration and thus resulting in low energy requirements altogether the cdp tio2 microspheres represent promising materials for potential use in photocatalytic water treatment and secondary effluent polishing declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

adsorption tests the catalyst 20 mg was dispersed into 40 ml solution with an initial bpa concentration of 20 mg l 1 aliquots 200 μl were taken at predetermined time intervals and the remaining bpa in the solution was analyzed to obtain the adsorption kinetics the bpa concentration was determined by hplc lc 20at shimadzu chromatography equipped with a uv vis detector a dc18 reverse phase column atlantis 3 μm 3 9 15 mm waters was used for separation with acetonitrile water 60 40 v v at a flow rate of 1 ml min 1 the detection and quantification limits of bpa analysis were 1 and 10 μg l 1 respectively the amount of bpa adsorbed was calculated using the equation qe ci ce v m where qe is the adsorbate amount adsorbed on the adsorbent at equilibrium mg g 1 ci is the initial concentration in water mg l 1 ce is the final equilibrium concentration in water mg l 1 v is the solution volume l and m is the mass of the adsorbent g to characterize adsorption kinetics time course data were fit to a pseudo second order kinetic model which considers a two step adsorption process involving solute diffusion through the adsorbent and then chemical sorption as the rate limiting step ho and mckay 1999 adsorption of solutes to complex materials with abundant and diverse adsorption sites tends to follow pseudo second order kinetics wang and guo 2020 where the rate of change in the amount adsorbed dq dt is proportional to the squared difference between the equilibrium adsorption capacity q e and the amount adsorbed at any time q 1 d q d t k 2 q e q 2 where k 2 is the adsorption rate constant eq 1 can be integrated to 2 q q e 2 k 2 t 1 q e k 2 t the catalyst 20 mg was dispersed into 40 ml solution with various initial bpa concentration 10 200 mg l 1 for adsorption isotherm test the equilibrium concentration of bpa was analyzed after 24 h 2 6 photocatalytic degradation of bpa and evaluation on catalyst stability the photocatalytic activity of the cdp tio2 was tested in a batch system with six uva lamps 365 nm 4 w f4t5 blb irradiation the photon flux was 3 83 10 6 e l 1s 1 measured by actinometry bolton et al 2011 uva light 365 nm was used for irradiation considering that higher energy uvc which is primarily used for disinfection is easily absorbed by organics resulting in inefficient utilization and potential deterioration of some materials phong and hur 2016 the catalyst 20 mg was dispersed into 40 ml bpa solution 20 mg l 1 in a quartz beaker although higher bpa concentrations have been reported in some industrial effluent chou et al 2014 lee et al 2015 this initial bpa concentration is relatively high compared to those commonly found in municipal secondary effluent which rarely exceed a few μg l 1 hu et al 2019 spataro et al 2019 nevertheless it facilitated chemical analysis to characterize sorption and degradation processes and served to demonstrate proof of concept under more challenging treatment conditions i e relatively high bpa concentrations ahmed et al 2011 saadati et al 2016 aliquots 1 ml were taken after predetermined intervals of irradiation time and the catalysts were filtered out using 0 22 μm ptfe syringe filter photocatalytic degradation tests of bpa were conducted in the context of deionized water or a secondary effluent polishing from a treatment plant the performance of cdp tio2 was benchmarked against p25 in secondary effluent for four treatment cycles 3 h per cycle after each cycle the solid was separated by centrifugation photocatalysis by products were identified by hplc ms in a microtof bruker equipped with an esi source and interfaced with an agilent 1200 hplc a c18 column imtakt sherzo sm c18 3 μm 150 mm 2 mm was used for separation with acetonitrile water both buffered with 0 1 of formic acid as the mobile phase a gradient method was applied to mobile phase started with 2 acetonitrile and maintained for 5 min then increased the ratio of acetonitrile to 50 in 10 min and maintained for 10 min and decreased to 2 acetonitrile in 5 min the potential destruction of cdp coating after repeated usage was determined by measuring the total organic carbon toc in the cdp tio2 material dispersion after 100 h irradiation under the same conditions as the photocatalysis experiments the catalyst was separated by centrifugation and the toc was measured by toc vchs shimadzu the stability of cdp tio2 was evaluated through repeated usage for 1000 h in detail 20 mg of cdp tio2 was dispersed into 40 ml of bpa 20 mg l 1 solution and kept irradiation for 1000 h the catalyst was collected by centrifugation at specific time intervals i e 100 200 400 600 800 and 1000 h to evaluate its long term performance on bpa removal 3 results and discussion 3 1 preparation of cross linked fluorinated cyclodextrin polymer coating with resistance to ros oxidation we prepared a fluorinated cross linked cd polymer cdp coating anchored to the surface of tio2 microspheres to enable contaminant sorption near photocatalytic sites and improve stability in the presence of ros the cdp coating was prepared though condensation polymerization of β cyclodextrin and tetrafluoroterephthalonitrile as previously reported alsbaiee et al 2016 although we prepared it in a relatively simple batch reaction step separately tio2 microsphere photocatalysts were prepared via a hydrothermal method as previously reported zhang et al 2018 to anchor the cdp onto the tio2 microsphere surface the cdp and tio2 were dispersed in water in the presence of cyanamide the resulting materials were washed extensively to remove unattached cdp this general procedure enables us to tune the amount of cdp coating present on the tio2 microspheres and we prepared cdp tio2 microspheres with varying amounts of cdp coatings the materials were labeled according to the weight percentage of cdp anchored cdp 3 tio2 cdp 5 tio2 and cdp 30 tio2 as determined by thermogravimetric analysis tga the resulting cdp tio2 particles were characterized in terms of morphology surface chemistry and pore structure the sem images of cdp 5 tio2 fig 1 a showed a hierarchichally structured surface and constituent nanosheets the diameter of cdp 5 tio2 was in the range of 3 5 μm successful anchoring of cdp was confirmed through ftir analysis fig 1b three bands at 2929 cm 1 1157 cm 1 and 1029 cm 1 were identified from the spectra of cdp tio2 which represent c h stretch c o stretch of cyclodextrin and the o c o antisymmetric glycosidic vibrational modes respectively wang et al 2019 the signals observed at 1320 1484 and 1675 cm 1 correspond to c f stretch c c aromatic stretch and cn nitrile stretch respectively cdp 5 tio2 had a bet surface area of 197 2 m2 g 1 which was three times higher than commercial tio2 evonik p25 58 9 m2 g 1 table s1 the specific surface decreased as the content of cdp increased table s1 this was expected because the specific area of cdp 3 8 m2 g 1 is much lower than that for bare tio2 microspheres 208 9 m2 g 1 the cdp tio2 has similar textural characteristics to bare tio2 microspheres both having the same isotherm and hysteresis loop type and an average pore size between 3 and 11 nm fig s1 and table s1 the nitrogen adsorption isotherms for these particles are of type ii fig 1d which indicates the formation of nonporous or macroporous structure thommes et al 2015 3 2 improved bpa adsorption capacity after cdp anchoring relative to bare and cyclodextrin coated tio2 microspheres next we studied the potential for the cdp nanoparticles to uptake bpa in water through adsorption tests compared with bare tio2 microspheres and cd tio2 cdp coating significantly enhanced the bpa adsorption rate and capacity and this is reflected in the adsorption kinetics data fig 2 a the pseudo second order model produced an excellent fit of the adsorption kinetics data equation 2 this fit was superior than that from a pseudo first order kinetics model based on pearson s chi squared test fig s2a and s2b the second order model parameters for each microsphere tested are provided in table s2 and show that the adsorption rate of cdp 5 tio2 was two times higher than that of cd tio2 and four times higher than that of bare tio2 microspheres table s2 the adsorption isotherms also showed that the adsorption capacity increased with increasing content of cdp fig 2b even though the specific surface area decreased as the content of coated cdp increased table s1 the adsorption isotherm for all microspheres exhibited a plateau above 50 mg g 1 with the exception of cdp 30 tio2 in which the amount of bpa adsorbed increased monotonically up to the highest concentration tested 200 mg g 1 the adsorption isotherm of the cdp 30 tio2 material were best fit by the freundlich model in which the adsorption capacity increase exponentially with the initial concentration in contrast all other materials followed the langmuir model al ghouti and da ana 2020 this likely reflects a shift from monolayered adsorption pattern described by the langmuir isotherm to multi layered adsorption described by the freundlich isotherm consistent with the apparent formation of multi layer cdp coating on the tio2 surface when increasing cdp loading the adsorption parameters are shown in table 1 and show that the cdp tio2 microspheres have higher adsorption capacities than bare tio2 or cd tio2 microspheres 3 3 enhanced photocatalytic degradation of bpa after cdp coating relative to bare and cyclodextrin coated tio2 microspheres next we tested the effectiveness of cdp tio2 for the photocatalytic degradation of bpa photocatalytic degradation of bpa was tested with different catalysts in di water to evaluate the effect of cdp coating on photoactivity without confounding effects by background ros scavengers fig s3 the photocatalytic degradation data followed pseudo first order kinetics fig s3 the rate constant for bpa degradation table s3 by cdp 5 tio2 0 025 0 002 min 1 was 1 7 times higher than that for bare tio2 microspheres 0 015 0 001 min 1 and similar to that previously reported for cd tio2 0 025 0 001 min 1 zhang et al 2018 next we tested the performance of the microspheres in the presence of competing species effluent organic matter efom is present in secondary effluent and competes with bpa for cdp sorption sites occludes the photocatalytic surface and scavenges photogenerated ros photocatalytic degradation tests on bpa with cdp tio2 were conducted in secondary effluent toc 8 64 0 25 mg l 1 ph 7 2 from a local wastewater treatment plant 69th st wastewater treatment complex of houston tx fig 3 while cdp tio2 particles removed 99 8 of bpa within 2 h when tested in di water only 80 2 of bpa was degraded after 3 h treatment in secondary effluent in addition cdp 5 tio2 showed progressive loss of photoactivity in cycling tests in secondary effluent with bpa removal decreasing to 71 7 by the fourth cycle nevertheless this decrease in performance was not as significant as observed for either cd tio2 or p25 which removed only 29 8 and 6 2 bpa by the fourth cycle in secondary effluent respectively fig 3 these results demonstrate that cdp tio2 is less susceptible to inhibition by competing species compared with cd tio2 or p25 we attribute this to the greater adsorption rate and capacity for these nanoparticles additionally p25 readily aggregates in the presence of multivalent ions such as ca2 katz et al 2015 and the average particle size table s4 increased from 300 4 nm in di water to 800 12 nm in secondary effluent which leads to decreased surface area and photoactivity in contrast aggregation of cdp tio2 was insignificant zhang et al 2018 zhao et al 2018 the average particle size of cdp tio2 in either di water tables s4 3 62 0 4 μm or in secondary effluent 3 89 0 6 μm determined by dls was statistically undistinguishable and similar to the sem observation 3 5 μm tio2 microspheres with various amounts of cdp coating were tested in di water to optimize the extent of surface modification fig 4 a bpa adsorption increased with cdp content but the rate constants of photocatalytic degradation of bpa exhibited a bell shaped pattern as a function of cdp content fig 4b specifically photocatalytic degradation rate increased with polymer content up to 5 the degradation rate constant k was 0 023 0 001 min 1 for cdp 3 tio2 and 0 025 0 002 min 1 for cdp 5 tio2 however further increases in the cdp content had a detrimental effect on bpa degradation efficiency the degradation rate constant for cdp 30 tio2 was 0 014 0 003 min 1 we attribute this increase in degradation rate followed by a decrease at higher cdp contents to an increase in adsorption capacity with increasing cdp but also higher probability for occlusion of photocatalytic sites on the tio2 surface by the polymer furthermore cdp is fluorescent under uva irradiation fig s4 and may compete with the tio2 surface for photons based on ion chromatographic analysis fig s5 the production of radicals oh was the primary mechanism to destroy bpa by photocatalysis leading to the formation of the hydroxylated compounds showed in table s5 the most abundant compound was the bpa o catechol formed from the addition of an oh group onto the aromatic ring of the bpa the identified compounds from the ion chromatograph shown in fig s5 coincide with some byproducts reported in the fenton process molkenthin et al 2013 mu et al 2017 yang et al 2016 zhang et al 2014 zheng et al 2018 3 4 stability considerations the cdp coating was significantly more stable than the baseline cd coating previously reported zhang et al 2018 we monitored the stability of cdp 5 tio2 nanoparticles under irradiation in clean di water by measuring the toc 0 55 0 01 mg l 1 and only 2 4 wt of the cdp coating was released as dissolved toc after 100 h of irradiation photocatalytic durability was enhanced compared with cd tio2 which after 500 h of irradiation experienced 70 degradation or detachment of cd zhang et al 2018 the cdp 5 tio2 photocatalytic nanoparticles remained stable and active under long term irradiation no significant loss of photoactivity was observed after 1000 h the rate constant decreased slightly from 0 027 0 002 min 1 for unexposed cdp 5 tio2 to 0 024 0 001 min 1 for cdp 5 tio2 fig 5 in contrast significant loss of activity was observed for cd tio2 after 400 h usage these results demonstrate significant photocatalytic stability for cdp tio2 nanoparticles providing a potential route to more practical photocatalytic applications 4 conclusions a novel ros resistant fluorinated cyclodextrin polymer was used as a coating for tio2 microspheres and provided superior photoactivity and durability benchmarked against cd tio2 and commercial p25 the cdp tio2 microspheres are promising multifunctional catalysts for advanced water treatment that enable a trap and zap treatment approach and are more resistant than p25 tio2 to interference by background constituents in a secondary effluent polishing context furthermore the coated cdp microspheres exhibit minor photoactivity loss after 1000 h of continuous use whereas significant loss of activity was observed for cd tio2 after 400 h usage under similar conditions finally the size of the cdp tio2 enables separation by low pressure filtration and thus resulting in low energy requirements altogether the cdp tio2 microspheres represent promising materials for potential use in photocatalytic water treatment and secondary effluent polishing declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

17773,we present the first study investigating optimized regeneration strategies for anionic ion exchange ix resins during the removal of persistent per and poly fluoroalkyl substances pfas including genx from surface and treated wastewater effluents ix regeneration studies are of critical importance from environmental perspectives specifically the knowledge is essential for water utilities who presently operate ix for pfas removal in a single use and dispose mode in this study legacy pfas such as pfoa pfos were tested along with other harmful short chained pfas pfba pfbs and other toxic perfluorinated substitutes genx studies were performed on synthetic water spiked with suwannee river natural organic matter srnom fulvic acid srfa and humic acid srha surface water and wastewater effluents and the regeneration was performed in batch stirred reactors the resin service life with and without regeneration was investigated in the presence of background organic matter in ultra pure waters all pfas c0 10 μg l concentrations similar to that of natural waters were effectively removed for 100 000 bed volume bv of operation this was reduced to 23 500 bv in the presence of srnom c0 5 mg c l 20 500 bv in srfa and 8500 bv in srha after which the saturated resins required regeneration more importantly all resin breakthrough pfas 70 ng l corresponded to 90 resin site saturation in meqs an essential information for optimizing ix loading the competitive dissolved organic matter dom fractions were estimated to be approximately 5 9 of the initial doc as estimated by the iast ebc model finally it was identified that ix regeneration efficiency improved with increasing brine contact time but effectiveness plateaued for brine concentrations above 10 w v nonetheless a regeneration with 10 nacl solution with a contact time of 2 h was found to be optimal for ix operations in synthetic and natural waters therefore this study provides key knowledge essential for the scientific community and the water industry on optimizing ix operational parameters for dom and pfas removal and would be highly valuable for systems which presently operate ix in a use and dispose mode graphical abstract image 1 keywords brine potable reuse genx short chained pfas recycled wastewater surface water 1 introduction per and poly fluoroalkyl substances pfas are man made chemicals which have been used in cookware firefighting foams and many other consumer products since 1940s rahman et al 2014 pfas are typically found in surface waters contaminated by discharges from industrial effluents effluents from wastewater treatment plants and storm water runoffs potentially impacting humans via consumption of drinking water zareitalabad et al 2013 long chained pfass such as perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa and perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos were widely used as aqueous dispersing agents to make fluoropolymers however these compounds were phased out by 2015 in the united states as they presented concerns related to bioaccumulation and toxicity for the human population ateia et al 2019 shorter chained pfass such as heptafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid hfpo da acid also known as genx are replacements for pfoa and have been widely used in the recent years for the manufacture of non stick coatings for industrial applications however toxicological studies have indicated that genx is more toxic to mammalian liver than other long chained pfass conley et al 2019 usepa 2019 moreover hfpo da is stable to photolysis and biodegradation resulting in its increased detection in the environment the drinking water provisional goal for exposure to genx is 140 ng l which is intended to safeguard the most sensitive population i e the bottle fed infants hopkins et al 2018 sun et al 2016 removal of pfas from water is a major challenge since conventional water treatment technologies have limited ability to eliminate pfas from water kucharzyk et al 2017 advanced treatment processes such as low pressure membrane filtration mf uf advanced oxidation and ozonation are ineffective for pfas removal glover et al 2018 moreover processes such as activated carbon exhibit lower adsorption of genx and other short chained pfas such as perfluorobutanoic acid pfba in comparison to other legacy pfas such as perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa and perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos wang et al 2019 therefore an effective treatment process to remove both legacy and emerging pfas from drinking water systems is warranted under ph relevant to water treatment most pfas are negatively charged goss 2008 consequently anion exchange ix processes that have previously been adopted for dissolved organic matter dom removal from drinking water sources offer a great potential for the removal of pfas from contaminated water resources the growing interest for adopting ix for pfas removal is evidenced by the increased scientific publications on pfas and ix in the past recent years maimaiti et al 2018 mccleaf et al 2017 additionally ix has demonstrated effective removal of emerging pfas such as genx from various surface and recycled water sources dixit et al 2020 anionic ix resins that are commonly used for water treatment dom removal can be regenerated and reused using concentrated brine solutions nacl to restore the exhausted resin back to its ionic form of service dixit et al 2018a levchuk et al 2018 although some scientific studies have performed regeneration on ix during pfas removal the existing data do not relate this to dom and its characteristics du et al 2015 zaggia et al 2016 for instance few studies have investigated the regeneration of different pfas under fixed organic matter backgrounds du et al 2015 woodard et al 2017 zaggia et al 2016 moreover the impact of adopted regeneration protocol on dom elution was not presented considering that ix is effective in capturing dom and that dom concentration in natural waters is several orders of magnitude higher mg l than pfas ng μg l an effective recovery of dom would be key for practical reusability of ix resins more importantly the published scientific data on ix regeneration is often limited to legacy pfas only carter and farrell 2010 du et al 2015 to date none of these studies have looked at the regeneration of the resins and their re use potentials for the removal of emerging pfas such as genx from natural waters dom is associated with the formation of harmful disinfection by products membrane fouling and taste and odour issues with drinking and recycled waters cornelissen et al 2010 westerhoff et al 1999 winter et al 2018 it also impacts efficacy of downstream processes such as advanced oxidation and chlorination lin and wang 2011 swietlik et al 2004 dom characteristics specifically the charge density and molecular weight distribution are spatially and seasonally variable finkbeiner et al 2018 therefore changes in background dom characteristics could potentially influence the subsequent regeneration protocols during pfas removal from natural and recycled waters yet no scientific study addresses this fundamental question although few studies have examined the impact of changing dom characteristics on pfas removal data on ix regeneration has not been reported dixit et al 2019c maimaiti et al 2018 hence water utilities often opt for incinerating the ix resins after single use say after 150 000 250 000 bed volumes bvs of operation horst et al 2018 purolite corporation 2017 resulting in significant operating costs higher resin demand and greater environmental burden of the overall ix process amini et al 2015 liu et al 2017 maul et al 2014 therefore recovery and regeneration of ix resins could significantly reduce the environmental impacts of ix systems when compared to use and dispose mode of operation an essential knowledge obtained via this research in the present study we have investigated the regenerative and reuse capabilities of purolite a860 a strong basic anionic ix resin well studied for dom and micropollutant removal bazri and mohseni 2016 dixit et al 2018b winter et al 2018 assays were performed on synthetic surface and recycled wastewater sources with multiple pfas including genx the resin service life with and without regeneration was investigated and the impact of background organic matter on pfas removal was evaluated we also investigated the impact of brine nacl concentration and contact time to optimize the regeneration protocol in the context of both dom and pfas removal finally comparative studies were performed on wastewater effluents pre treated with micro and ultra filtration membranes mf uf to mimic scenarios of potable reuse schemes and the resin performance for pfas and dom removal was evaluated for multiple regeneration cycles the results of this study indicate that ix is a promising option for simultaneous removal of dom and legacy emerging pfas such as pfba and genx during water treatment and reuse applications 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals heptadecafluorooctanesulfonic acid pfos cas 173 23 1 40 in water pentadecafluorooctanoic acid pfoa cas 335 67 1 5 g powder as well as short

background compound ebc model was employed to distinguish between the uptake of dom and the dom fraction that directly competes with pfas for uptake sites an equivalent background compound ebc our

pfos t 4 57 min as injection internal standards obtained from wellington laboratories guelph on canada as previously described dixit et al 2020 2019c 3 results and discussion 3 1 breakthrough studies in dom rich waters resin service life is expected to depend largely on the water matrix characteristics including the concentrations of inorganic anions and dom to first address the issue of organic matter competition resin breakthrough studies were performed with 10 μg l influent pfas concentration pfoa pfos pfba pfbs and genx in di and dom rich waters up to 20 mg c l the experiments were performed via multiple loading tests using 0 04 2 ml l 9 440 mg l ix resins details in si these dosages covered a wide range of resin meqs to contaminant meqs ratio 10 1 to 1 50 in meqs which based on our past studies were sufficient to achieve good micropollutant removal performance from natural surface waters and ideal for examining the competitive interactions dixit et al 2018b note that the upper limit of pfas concentrations detected in natural environments worst case scenarios are often similar to the selected initial concentration for this study hopkins et al 2018 xiao 2017 3 1 1 effect of dom concentration fig 1 a and b depict the ix performance for the legacy pfas pfoa and pfos removal under varied dom concentrations in di waters no resin breakthrough c 70 ng l was observed for up to 150 000 bv for all pfas see si figure s 7 moreover the effluent pfoa pfos concentration always remained below 70 ng l usepa limit for the first 150 000 bv of operation in di waters no tests were done beyond 150 000 bv however these were performed at a resin dosage of 9 mg l or 0 04 ml l to optimize water requirements for the experiment details on resin dosage selection and bv calculations can be found in si section s 4 in the presence of 2 5 mg c l doc from srnom pfoa concentrations exceeded the usepa guideline 70 ng l after 28 000 500 bv of operation note at 28 000 500 bv the total uptake of pfoa approximated 1 of resin site occupancy in meq while the doc removal corresponded to 89 site occupancy approximate resin capacity 0 8 meq ml dixit et al 2019b 2018b similarly as observed in fig 1 b pfos concentrations exceeded the guideline value after 33 000 500 bv of operation 97 site occupancy 1 by pfoa and 96 by doc increasing the influent doc from 2 5 to 5 mg c l further reduced the ix service life to 22 000 500 bv for pfoa and 27 000 500 bv for pfos or 95 site occupancy for both further increase in the influent doc concentration to 20 mg c l resulted in an approximately 3 fold decrease in the ix service life for pfoa 9500 500 bv 95 site occupancy and pfos 10 500 500 bv 99 site occupancy therefore the first hypothesis on dom s important detrimental effect on ix efficacy for pfas removal was quantitively validated fig 2 a illustrates the doc removal as a function of srnom loading with different pfas it was observed that increasing pfas charge density corresponded to a decreasing average doc removal for instance an average 85 doc removal was achieved for pfoa 10 4 meq g c at initial doc loading of 2 5 mg c l p 0 05 however with pfba 20 8 meq g c the doc removal averaged 78 at same initial doc loading p 0 05 similarly in the water matrix with pfbs doc removal averaged 70 while it was 85 for pfos note the breakthrough c 70 ng l also corresponded well with increasing pfas charge as shown in fig 2 b i e faster breakthrough for less charged pfoa say 28 000 500 bv at doc 2 5 mg c l over pfba 35 500 500 bv at 2 5 mg c l hence the breakthrough time is changed depending upon the specific pfas ultimately resulting in a lower doc removal with increasing breakthrough bed volume similarly for pfas with same functional groups sulfonyl pfos breakthrough was observed at 33 000 500 bv and pfbs at 40 000 500 bv in the context of functional group interestingly at low doc 2 5 mg c l ix exhibited later breakthrough i e guideline exceedance for pfas with sulfonic functional group say pfos 33 000 500 bv when compared to pfas with ether acids genx at 31000 500 bv and carboxylic functional groups pfoa at 28 000 500 bv in all water matrices tested p 0 05 hence it can be assumed that ix preferentially removed pfas with sulfonyl groups over ether acids and carboxylic acid functional groups this is in agreement with the observed preferential removal of sulfonyl based pfas over carboxylic based pfas zaggia et al 2016 at higher doc concentrations doc 5 mg c l breakthrough values for all pfas were very similar for instance it was 16 000 500 bv for pfba and 16 500 500 bv for pfbs at 10 mg c l similarly at 20 mg c l initial doc concentration the breakthrough bv for genx 9500 500 bv pfoa 9500 500 bv and pfos 10 500 500 bv were very similar this observed behavior at high initial doc could potentially be a consequence of high doc say at c0 20 mg c l to pfas 10 μg l ratio resulting in a faster resin saturation and comparable doc removal see fig 2 under variable pfas characteristics note a 40 reduction in dom with c0 20 mg c l would still correspond to 8 mg c uptake by the resin and is 4 fold higher than the 85 removal at dom with c0 2 5 mg c l 2 2 mg c uptake therefore we observe an earlier breakthrough for all pfas say between 9000 and 10 000 bv range at dom of 20 mg c l as the resin sites get saturated earlier nonetheless the doc breakthrough defined arbitrarily as c c0 0 7 amini et al 2018 also ranged as 1000 bv with the corresponding pfas breakthrough from 9000 bv to 40000 bv data not presented 3 1 2 effect of dom characteristics fig 3 a illustrates the impact of changing dom characteristics for the removal of genx emerging pfas we selected genx for studying the impact of dom characteristics on resin performance due to its growing environmental concern for water utilities usepa 2019 among the tested dom fractions plfa has the lowest charge density and lowest average molecular weight whereas srfa exhibits the highest charge density also srha a fraction with the highest average molecular weight was adopted to investigate the effect of size exclusion and pore blockage note the impact of variable dom characteristics on organic scavenger resin performance is well established in the scientific literature dixit et al 2018b zhang et al 2014 in our previous study we were able to identify that dom characteristics play a key role in governing the pfoa and pfos uptake via ix resins dixit et al 2019c however their subsequent impact on breakthrough is not reported in scientific literature an essential knowledge from application perspectives additionally the impacts of dom characteristics on the uptake of short chained pfas like pfba and ether pfas contaminants such as genx have not yet been reported necessitating the need for this investigation as seen in fig 3 a the longest breakthrough bv was observed in the presence of plfa the least charged dom and increasing the charge density of background dom fractions led to earlier breakthroughs for instance the breakthrough of genx on a860 resin decreased from 26 000 500 bv plfa to 20 500 500 bv srfa this is in agreement with the literature where greater removal of more charged dom fractions is documented increased removal of higher charged dom reduces the uptake sites on ix resin and consequently results in faster breakthrough note an earlier pfass breakthrough was observed in the presence of srha 5000 500 bv which is an evidence of pore blockage the evidence of pore blockage can also be observed in the doc removal data presented in fig 3 b for instance the doc removal for a860 decreased from 70 in srfa to 30 in the presence of srha see fig 3 b the pfas breakthrough was also modelled with influent doc to fit the exponential equation 4 b r e a k t h r o u g h b v α q k where q is defined as the load total contaminant meqs per resin meqs per liter and the term α and k are constants several scientific studies have adopted different models to relate carbon breakthrough as a function of influent doc concentration and uv absorbance anumol et al 2015 edzwald 2011 however this is slightly different from breakthrough estimations based of carbon adsorbents for an ion exchange system a meq based approach is a better descriptor from a fundamental perspective the obtained experimental values were utilized to estimate the average values of k and α see details in si table s 4 in general the experimental data agreed well when adopting a k value of 0 58 and ln α value of 8 97 r2 0 95 with the exception of srha pore blockage dixit et al 2019b zhang et al 2014 the changing breakthrough could thus be predicted and related to the initial pfas and dom characteristics i e charge density note that the resin pfas breakthrough for all assays except srha corresponded to 90 resin site occupancy total contaminant pfas doc uptake in meq divided by total resin capacity in meqs a key knowledge to predict pfas removal with other competing anions in natural waters capable of scavenging ion exchange sites such as sulphates nitrates etc 3 2 competitive interactions with dom isotherm studies were performed under varying resin dosages 9 1000 mg l or 0 04 4 5 ml l as described previously dixit et al 2019c with initial pfas concentration of 10 μg l and 5 mg c l srnom these dosages were selected as they offered a wide range of resin to contaminant loading 10 1 to 1 100 in meqs dixit et al 2018b the doc of 5 mg c l was selected as the natural recycled water from the vancouver convention centre and the collected surface water from middle river had a similar doc value and was already tested in one of our previous studies on surface waters dixit et al 2019a the isotherms conformed to a freundlich type behavior qe kf ce 1 n r2 0 99 details in si table s 5 in brief the 1 n values for pfoa and pfos were 0 83 0 03 and 0 79 0 04 in di waters respectively which were changed to 0 59 0 02 and 0 62 0 04 in the presence of 5 mg c l srnom respectively similarly the 1 n values for pfba pfbs and genx decreased from 0 93 0 02 0 96 0 02 and 0 82 0 05 to 0 70 0 02 pfba 0 59 0 03 pfbs and 0 60 0 03 genx respectively the k f values for all legacy long chained pfas decreased by approximately 7 folds in the presence of srnom 5 mg c l for instance the k f values for pfoa decreased from 793 26 μeq meq μeq l 1 n in di water to 101 4 μeq meq μeq l 1 n in srnom similarly the k f values for pfos were reduced from 745 23 μeq meq μeq l 1 n in di water to 115 17 μeq meq μeq l 1 n in 5 mg c l srnom a similar 7 fold decrease a similar 7 fold decrease was observed for genx as well see details in si however for shorter chained pfas the k f values decreased approximately 6 fold from 964 12 μeq meq μeq l 1 n to 164 2 μeq meq μeq l 1 n in srnom for pfba the equivalent background compound ebc model was employed to distinguish between the uptake of dom and the dom fraction that directly competes with pfas for uptake sites an equivalent background compound ebc the ebc parameters k ebc 1 n ebc and c oebc were determined as previously described dixit et al 2019b fig 4 a shows the concentration of competing compounds c oebc as a function of initial doc srnom for different pfas as observed increasing the concentration of background dom increases the concentration of competing dom fractions and thereby results in lower pfas uptake for all the compounds for instance according to the ebc model 0 3 μmol l of dom from srnom competed with pfoa at an initial doc of 2 mg c l this increased to 3 32 μmol l in the presence of 20 mg c l 10 fold increase if we assume an average molecular weight of dom fractions 1000 g mol and 55 carbon content of dom as previously adopted dixit et al 2019b 2018b these competing fractions approximate to 8 5 of the initial doc as competing fractions these values agree well with the published ebc studies which have identified that 5 10 of initial dom directly compete for active sites on activated carbon dixit et al 2019b matsui et al 2012 for compounds with the same functional group the concentration of ebc decreases with increasing charge density for instance at a doc of 5 mg c l the competitive fraction as estimated by ebc for pfba was approximately 5 which was estimated to be 8 5 for pfoa more importantly the concentrations of competing dom fractions c oebc for pfos is always lower than pfoa for example at a doc of 2 mg l 0 3 and 0 2 μmol l dom competes with pfoa and pfos respectively similarly at a doc of 10 mg l pfoa competes with 1 65 μmol l dom while only 1 32 μmol l dom competes with pfos p 0 05 estimated concentrations of ebc for pfba are also higher than pfbs at all times p 0 05 thus this study further validates the previously observed literature on preferential uptake of sulfonyl based pfas appleman et al 2014 mccleaf et al 2017 and also indicates that ebc model can be used to describe the competition of pfas with dom in an ix system additionally the higher ebc concentration for genx in comparison to pfba and pfbs compounds with similar charge density further indicates lower preference of ether acids in comparison to alkylic acids with carboxylic and sulfonyl functional groups as depicted in fig 4 b the concentration of competing compounds for genx increased with increasing charge density of background dom srfa 0 88 0 04 μmol l srnom 0 74 0 03 μmol l plfa 0 63 0 02 μmol l note that these concentrations also approximate to 4 5 9 0 of the initial dom concentration and agree well with the studies in the scientific literature as discussed earlier however the ebc model was not tested for srha as it has been reported to fail in the presence of pore blockage dixit et al 2019b 2018b 3 3 regeneration studies pfas and dom elution studies were performed under two scenarios of different brine concentrations and contact times optimal brine concentration and contact time are usually provided by the ix resin suppliers for packed bed operation e g 1 h contact time at 10 nacl for purolite a860 purolite 2017 however a860 is an organic scavenger resin tested only for dom removal to the best of our knowledge no scientific manufacturer study ever evaluated a860 for pfas removal purolite 2017 thus saturated resins recovered after 70 ng l breakthrough 25 000 bv at 5 mg c l water were employed to evaluate the impact of brine concentration and contact time on pfas recovery note that an efficient pfas recovery would also relate to a fresher ix resin with higher capacity and could thereby increase the service life of the ix resin multiple reuse 3 3 1 effect of brine concentration to examine the effect of brine concentration on pfas and dom recovery from saturated ix resins six different brine concentrations were used all studies were performed for a contact time of 2 h 1 l beaker at 150 rpm dixit et al 2018b fig 5 a depicts the pfas concentration detected in the regenerant brine as a function of initial nacl concentration increasing the initial nacl concentration from 1 to 5 w v resulted in an increase of pfas in the brine for instance pfoa recovery increased from 0 68 0 01 mg l to 1 42 0 02 mg l a twofold increase p 0 05 or from 34 to 70 recovery respectively similarly the pfos concentration under similar conditions increased from 0 56 0 02 mg l to 1 3 0 05 mg l or from 28 to 65 recovery p 0 05 further increase in salt concentration to 10 nacl resulted in 1 88 0 03 mg pfoa l 94 recovery and 1 8 0 02 mg pfos l 90 recovery in the spent brine more importantly at low nacl concentrations say at 1 and 5 the recovered concentrations of pfoa 0 68 0 01 mg l and 1 42 0 02 mg l was higher than those of pfos 0 56 0 02 mg l and 1 3 0 05 mg l further confirming a stronger bondage affinity between sulphonyl pfas and ix resin over carboxylic based pfas this can also be verified while observing pfba 0 73 0 04 mg l and pfbs 0 58 0 03 mg l concentrations in brine with 1 nacl note at brine concentrations of 10 and higher the eluted concentration of all pfas is 90 for all tested compounds indicating that 10 nacl is optimum for pfas recovery approximately 80 2 doc was also recovered for nacl concentrations of 10 15 and 20 this information is of importance to minimize brine consumption while maximizing ix recovery 3 3 2 effect of brine contact time the impact of regeneration time was evaluated by testing the pfas release with 10 nacl as recoveries plateaued for brine concentrations of greater 10 concentration under varied contact times fig 5 b illustrates that increasing contact time improved pfas elution especially up until 2 h for instance pfoa concentration in the spent brine increased from 0 24 0 01 mg l 12 recovery to 0 82 0 01 mg l 40 recovery and 1 62 0 03 mg l 80 recovery when contact time increased from 10 min to 30 min and 60 min respectively similarly pfos concentrations for these time intervals were 0 14 0 01 mg l 7 0 58 0 02 mg l 30 and 1 42 0 06 mg l 70 recovery respectively the concentration of genx in the spent brine also increased from 0 25 0 02 10 min of contact time to 1 66 0 06 60 min as shown in fig 5 b increasing the contact time to 2 h resulted in further release of pfas from the resin however there was little increase in the elution of pfas beyond 2 h suggesting that the elution was essentially completed after 2 h with 10 nacl concentration fig 5 c and d illustrate the effect of brine concentration and contact time on dom elution removing dom from the resin is critically important because of the need to minimize irreversible fouling on the resin as observed an effective regeneration with 10 nacl solution for a contact time of 2 h or more would ensure 90 dom recovery after 25 000 bv of operation note that we previously identified 90 pfas recovery under this scenario similar to the observation made with pfas dom recovery increased with increasing initial brine concentration with an optimized dosage identified at 10 nacl differences in dom recovery when tested under different pfas were also not statistically significant at 95 confidence level data not shown moreover an increase in the regeneration time using the supplier recommended 10 initial brine concentration up until 120 min ensured greater elution of dom corresponding to 87 one published study in the scientific literature has reported only up to 4 recovery of pfbs see si s 14 in regenerated ix brine using naoh on polyacrylic gel structured resins carter and farrell 2010 similarly 80 pfas recovery was reported using a mixture of 80 ch3oh and 1 nh4cl when testing multiple polystyrene resins with different functional groups zaggia et al 2016 this is clearly an environmental challenge considering the storage and handling issues for pfas loaded methanol bicarbonate and nacl used in this study are more suitable chemical from environmental perspectives in comparison to other salts used for ix regeneration maul et al 2014 further the regenerated resin in this study performed similarly to the fresh ix resins tested for subsequent cycles i e for another 5000 bv after regeneration without any indication of saturation or breakthrough further discussed in following sections however longer pilot studies would be needed to better assess the loss of regeneration performance over time finally with respect to the regeneration contact time a 2 h regeneration ensured 90 pfas and 85 dom elution and a feasible scenario for practical operation hence the results of this study indicate that ix can be regenerated and effectively reused for multiple cycles with an optimized regeneration strategy 10 nacl for 2 h contact time in a stirred reactor 3 4 studies in natural waters figs 6 and 7 illustrate the ix performance for pfas removal from di water srnom water as well as natural vcc and synthetic wastewater effluents the influent pfas concentrations were maintained at 10 μg l and were tested for 25 000 bv in sum the vcc water was composed of nitrate 26 mg l sulphate 32 mg l and phosphate 10 mg l which all were reduced to 2 mg n s p l after ix treatment see fig 7 c isotherm studies were performed under varying resin dosages 9 1000 mg l or 0 04 4 5 ml l with initial pfas concentration of 10 μg l in natural waters to examine the competitive interactions via ebc 2 5 4 5 of initial ion concentration further details in si in di waters no pfas was detected in the treated water until 25 000 bv of operation in the presence of background organics and other anions vcc wastewater effluent exhibited a breakthrough pfas 70 ng l after 17 000 500 bv for pfoa and 18 500 500 for pfos note that the breakthroughs for both natural and synthetic wastewaters were earlier than that of the srnom water at the same initial doc concentration 5 mg c l i e 22 000 500 bv for pfoa and 24 000 500 bv for pfos refer to figs 1 and 2 however it was identified that the resins are capable of capturing 90 of the sulphate 85 of phosphate and 70 of nitrate ions see details table s 6 of si therefore the faster breakthroughs in the wastewater effluents can be attributed to the presence of inorganic ions moreover sulphate was identified as the most competitive anion 3 9 competitive fractions estimated via ebc see table s 6 followed by phosphate 3 2 ebc competitive fraction and nitrate 2 5 ebc competitive fraction ions respectively note that regeneration with 10 nacl for 2 h of contact time was able to recover 85 of the inorganic ions n s p from all natural waters see fig 7 d more details in si sections s 8 and s 9 the recovery of sulphate was high about 90 which is an expected performance for a new resin nevertheless studies on on site off site treatment options for the spent brine are needed several strategies have been adopted in scientific literature to treat the spent ix brine and reuse it for further regeneration cycles for instance processes such as high temperature incineration dorrance et al 2017 biological reduction mcadam and judd 2008 membrane biofilm reactors mcadam et al 2010 capacitive deionization ng et al 2008 nanofiltration vaudevire et al 2013 and photo catalytic processes yang et al 2013 are among the alternatives proposed for brine treatment and recycling however presence of pfas may add additional challenges towards brine treatment and disposal and therefore should be the focus of future investigations in the present research the resins were regenerated after 22 000 bv with the optimized procedure identified earlier 10 nacl 2 h of contact following regeneration the resins exhibited comparable performances to fresh ix resins for all water matrices tested natural see fig 6 a and 6 b or synthetic see fig 6 c indicating a good match between laboratory studies performed on synthetic and natural waters moreover regeneration after 22 000 bv ensured an effective doc removal comparable to the results with fresh ix resins indicating an effective regeneration with high recovery 90 for pfoa pfba 85 for pfos pfbs genx and 80 for doc as depicted in fig 7 b hence it could be concluded that ix exhibits robust and simultaneous removal of dom and pfas from natural drinking and reuse waters while exhibiting excellent regeneration and reuse capabilities 4 conclusions the following conclusions were derived from this research 99 pfas removal can be achieved for more than 150 000 bv in di waters pfas c0 10 μg l individual concentrations increasing background doc concentrations result in faster ix resin saturation with breakthrough after 23 500 500 bv for genx in 5 mg c l change in background dom charge density resulted in a faster breakthrough with more charged srfa 20 500 500 bv for genx preferential uptake of pfas with sulphonyl functional groups over pfas with carboxylic and ether acids groups is observed breakthrough corresponds to 90 site saturation in meqs for all tested waters with the exception of srha where pore blockage was observed approximately 0 3 3 μmol l 5 8 5 of the dom depending upon initial concentration and charge density and 2 5 4 5 inorganic ions competed with pfas for uptake sites as estimated by the iast ebc model ix regeneration efficiency improved with increasing brine contact time but effectiveness plateaued for brine concentrations above 10 w v a regeneration with 10 nacl and 120 min contact time in a stirred reactor was identified as the best regeneration protocol for maximizing pfas and dom recovery regenerated ix resin exhibited similar pfas dom uptake behavior equivalent as fresh ix resin for the next 5000 bv of a second cycle of operation regeneration with 10 nacl with 2 h of contact time ensured an effective recovery of pfas 85 doc 80 sulphate 90 phosphate 85 and nitrate 85 ions from natural waters ix exhibit great potential for simultaneous pfas and doc removals from recycled wastewater effluents and natural surface waters

17773,we present the first study investigating optimized regeneration strategies for anionic ion exchange ix resins during the removal of persistent per and poly fluoroalkyl substances pfas including genx from surface and treated wastewater effluents ix regeneration studies are of critical importance from environmental perspectives specifically the knowledge is essential for water utilities who presently operate ix for pfas removal in a single use and dispose mode in this study legacy pfas such as pfoa pfos were tested along with other harmful short chained pfas pfba pfbs and other toxic perfluorinated substitutes genx studies were performed on synthetic water spiked with suwannee river natural organic matter srnom fulvic acid srfa and humic acid srha surface water and wastewater effluents and the regeneration was performed in batch stirred reactors the resin service life with and without regeneration was investigated in the presence of background organic matter in ultra pure waters all pfas c0 10 μg l concentrations similar to that of natural waters were effectively removed for 100 000 bed volume bv of operation this was reduced to 23 500 bv in the presence of srnom c0 5 mg c l 20 500 bv in srfa and 8500 bv in srha after which the saturated resins required regeneration more importantly all resin breakthrough pfas 70 ng l corresponded to 90 resin site saturation in meqs an essential information for optimizing ix loading the competitive dissolved organic matter dom fractions were estimated to be approximately 5 9 of the initial doc as estimated by the iast ebc model finally it was identified that ix regeneration efficiency improved with increasing brine contact time but effectiveness plateaued for brine concentrations above 10 w v nonetheless a regeneration with 10 nacl solution with a contact time of 2 h was found to be optimal for ix operations in synthetic and natural waters therefore this study provides key knowledge essential for the scientific community and the water industry on optimizing ix operational parameters for dom and pfas removal and would be highly valuable for systems which presently operate ix in a use and dispose mode graphical abstract image 1 keywords brine potable reuse genx short chained pfas recycled wastewater surface water 1 introduction per and poly fluoroalkyl substances pfas are man made chemicals which have been used in cookware firefighting foams and many other consumer products since 1940s rahman et al 2014 pfas are typically found in surface waters contaminated by discharges from industrial effluents effluents from wastewater treatment plants and storm water runoffs potentially impacting humans via consumption of drinking water zareitalabad et al 2013 long chained pfass such as perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa and perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos were widely used as aqueous dispersing agents to make fluoropolymers however these compounds were phased out by 2015 in the united states as they presented concerns related to bioaccumulation and toxicity for the human population ateia et al 2019 shorter chained pfass such as heptafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid hfpo da acid also known as genx are replacements for pfoa and have been widely used in the recent years for the manufacture of non stick coatings for industrial applications however toxicological studies have indicated that genx is more toxic to mammalian liver than other long chained pfass conley et al 2019 usepa 2019 moreover hfpo da is stable to photolysis and biodegradation resulting in its increased detection in the environment the drinking water provisional goal for exposure to genx is 140 ng l which is intended to safeguard the most sensitive population i e the bottle fed infants hopkins et al 2018 sun et al 2016 removal of pfas from water is a major challenge since conventional water treatment technologies have limited ability to eliminate pfas from water kucharzyk et al 2017 advanced treatment processes such as low pressure membrane filtration mf uf advanced oxidation and ozonation are ineffective for pfas removal glover et al 2018 moreover processes such as activated carbon exhibit lower adsorption of genx and other short chained pfas such as perfluorobutanoic acid pfba in comparison to other legacy pfas such as perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa and perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos wang et al 2019 therefore an effective treatment process to remove both legacy and emerging pfas from drinking water systems is warranted under ph relevant to water treatment most pfas are negatively charged goss 2008 consequently anion exchange ix processes that have previously been adopted for dissolved organic matter dom removal from drinking water sources offer a great potential for the removal of pfas from contaminated water resources the growing interest for adopting ix for pfas removal is evidenced by the increased scientific publications on pfas and ix in the past recent years maimaiti et al 2018 mccleaf et al 2017 additionally ix has demonstrated effective removal of emerging pfas such as genx from various surface and recycled water sources dixit et al 2020 anionic ix resins that are commonly used for water treatment dom removal can be regenerated and reused using concentrated brine solutions nacl to restore the exhausted resin back to its ionic form of service dixit et al 2018a levchuk et al 2018 although some scientific studies have performed regeneration on ix during pfas removal the existing data do not relate this to dom and its characteristics du et al 2015 zaggia et al 2016 for instance few studies have investigated the regeneration of different pfas under fixed organic matter backgrounds du et al 2015 woodard et al 2017 zaggia et al 2016 moreover the impact of adopted regeneration protocol on dom elution was not presented considering that ix is effective in capturing dom and that dom concentration in natural waters is several orders of magnitude higher mg l than pfas ng μg l an effective recovery of dom would be key for practical reusability of ix resins more importantly the published scientific data on ix regeneration is often limited to legacy pfas only carter and farrell 2010 du et al 2015 to date none of these studies have looked at the regeneration of the resins and their re use potentials for the removal of emerging pfas such as genx from natural waters dom is associated with the formation of harmful disinfection by products membrane fouling and taste and odour issues with drinking and recycled waters cornelissen et al 2010 westerhoff et al 1999 winter et al 2018 it also impacts efficacy of downstream processes such as advanced oxidation and chlorination lin and wang 2011 swietlik et al 2004 dom characteristics specifically the charge density and molecular weight distribution are spatially and seasonally variable finkbeiner et al 2018 therefore changes in background dom characteristics could potentially influence the subsequent regeneration protocols during pfas removal from natural and recycled waters yet no scientific study addresses this fundamental question although few studies have examined the impact of changing dom characteristics on pfas removal data on ix regeneration has not been reported dixit et al 2019c maimaiti et al 2018 hence water utilities often opt for incinerating the ix resins after single use say after 150 000 250 000 bed volumes bvs of operation horst et al 2018 purolite corporation 2017 resulting in significant operating costs higher resin demand and greater environmental burden of the overall ix process amini et al 2015 liu et al 2017 maul et al 2014 therefore recovery and regeneration of ix resins could significantly reduce the environmental impacts of ix systems when compared to use and dispose mode of operation an essential knowledge obtained via this research in the present study we have investigated the regenerative and reuse capabilities of purolite a860 a strong basic anionic ix resin well studied for dom and micropollutant removal bazri and mohseni 2016 dixit et al 2018b winter et al 2018 assays were performed on synthetic surface and recycled wastewater sources with multiple pfas including genx the resin service life with and without regeneration was investigated and the impact of background organic matter on pfas removal was evaluated we also investigated the impact of brine nacl concentration and contact time to optimize the regeneration protocol in the context of both dom and pfas removal finally comparative studies were performed on wastewater effluents pre treated with micro and ultra filtration membranes mf uf to mimic scenarios of potable reuse schemes and the resin performance for pfas and dom removal was evaluated for multiple regeneration cycles the results of this study indicate that ix is a promising option for simultaneous removal of dom and legacy emerging pfas such as pfba and genx during water treatment and

background compound ebc model was employed to distinguish between the uptake of dom and the dom fraction that directly competes with pfas for uptake sites an equivalent background compound ebc our

in dom rich waters resin service life is expected to depend largely on the water matrix characteristics including the concentrations of inorganic anions and dom to first address the issue of organic matter competition resin breakthrough studies were performed with 10 μg l influent pfas concentration pfoa pfos pfba pfbs and genx in di and dom rich waters up to 20 mg c l the experiments were performed via multiple loading tests using 0 04 2 ml l 9 440 mg l ix resins details in si these dosages covered a wide range of resin meqs to contaminant meqs ratio 10 1 to 1 50 in meqs which based on our past studies were sufficient to achieve good micropollutant removal performance from natural surface waters and ideal for examining the competitive interactions dixit et al 2018b note that the upper limit of pfas concentrations detected in natural environments worst case scenarios are often similar to the selected initial concentration for this study hopkins et al 2018 xiao 2017 3 1 1 effect of dom concentration fig 1 a and b depict the ix performance for the legacy pfas pfoa and pfos removal under varied dom concentrations in di waters no resin breakthrough c 70 ng l was observed for up to 150 000 bv for all pfas see si figure s 7 moreover the effluent pfoa pfos concentration always remained below 70 ng l usepa limit for the first 150 000 bv of operation in di waters no tests were done beyond 150 000 bv however these were performed at a resin dosage of 9 mg l or 0 04 ml l to optimize water requirements for the experiment details on resin dosage selection and bv calculations can be found in si section s 4 in the presence of 2 5 mg c l doc from srnom pfoa concentrations exceeded the usepa guideline 70 ng l after 28 000 500 bv of operation note at 28 000 500 bv the total uptake of pfoa approximated 1 of resin site occupancy in meq while the doc removal corresponded to 89 site occupancy approximate resin capacity 0 8 meq ml dixit et al 2019b 2018b similarly as observed in fig 1 b pfos concentrations exceeded the guideline value after 33 000 500 bv of operation 97 site occupancy 1 by pfoa and 96 by doc increasing the influent doc from 2 5 to 5 mg c l further reduced the ix service life to 22 000 500 bv for pfoa and 27 000 500 bv for pfos or 95 site occupancy for both further increase in the influent doc concentration to 20 mg c l resulted in an approximately 3 fold decrease in the ix service life for pfoa 9500 500 bv 95 site occupancy and pfos 10 500 500 bv 99 site occupancy therefore the first hypothesis on dom s important detrimental effect on ix efficacy for pfas removal was quantitively validated fig 2 a illustrates the doc removal as a function of srnom loading with different pfas it was observed that increasing pfas charge density corresponded to a decreasing average doc removal for instance an average 85 doc removal was achieved for pfoa 10 4 meq g c at initial doc loading of 2 5 mg c l p 0 05 however with pfba 20 8 meq g c the doc removal averaged 78 at same initial doc loading p 0 05 similarly in the water matrix with pfbs doc removal averaged 70 while it was 85 for pfos note the breakthrough c 70 ng l also corresponded well with increasing pfas charge as shown in fig 2 b i e faster breakthrough for less charged pfoa say 28 000 500 bv at doc 2 5 mg c l over pfba 35 500 500 bv at 2 5 mg c l hence the breakthrough time is changed depending upon the specific pfas ultimately resulting in a lower doc removal with increasing breakthrough bed volume similarly for pfas with same functional groups sulfonyl pfos breakthrough was observed at 33 000 500 bv and pfbs at 40 000 500 bv in the context of functional group interestingly at low doc 2 5 mg c l ix exhibited later breakthrough i e guideline exceedance for pfas with sulfonic functional group say pfos 33 000 500 bv when compared to pfas with ether acids genx at 31000 500 bv and carboxylic functional groups pfoa at 28 000 500 bv in all water matrices tested p 0 05 hence it can be assumed that ix preferentially removed pfas with sulfonyl groups over ether acids and carboxylic acid functional groups this is in agreement with the observed preferential removal of sulfonyl based pfas over carboxylic based pfas zaggia et al 2016 at higher doc concentrations doc 5 mg c l breakthrough values for all pfas were very similar for instance it was 16 000 500 bv for pfba and 16 500 500 bv for pfbs at 10 mg c l similarly at 20 mg c l initial doc concentration the breakthrough bv for genx 9500 500 bv pfoa 9500 500 bv and pfos 10 500 500 bv were very similar this observed behavior at high initial doc could potentially be a consequence of high doc say at c0 20 mg c l to pfas 10 μg l ratio resulting in a faster resin saturation and comparable doc removal see fig 2 under variable pfas characteristics note a 40 reduction in dom with c0 20 mg c l would still correspond to 8 mg c uptake by the resin and is 4 fold higher than the 85 removal at dom with c0 2 5 mg c l 2 2 mg c uptake therefore we observe an earlier breakthrough for all pfas say between 9000 and 10 000 bv range at dom of 20 mg c l as the resin sites get saturated earlier nonetheless the doc breakthrough defined arbitrarily as c c0 0 7 amini et al 2018 also ranged as 1000 bv with the corresponding pfas breakthrough from 9000 bv to 40000 bv data not presented 3 1 2 effect of dom characteristics fig 3 a illustrates the impact of changing dom characteristics for the removal of genx emerging pfas we selected genx for studying the impact of dom characteristics on resin performance due to its growing environmental concern for water utilities usepa 2019 among the tested dom fractions plfa has the lowest charge density and lowest average molecular weight whereas srfa exhibits the highest charge density also srha a fraction with the highest average molecular weight was adopted to investigate the effect of size exclusion and pore blockage note the impact of variable dom characteristics on organic scavenger resin performance is well established in the scientific literature dixit et al 2018b zhang et al 2014 in our previous study we were able to identify that dom characteristics play a key role in governing the pfoa and pfos uptake via ix resins dixit et al 2019c however their subsequent impact on breakthrough is not reported in scientific literature an essential knowledge from application perspectives additionally the impacts of dom characteristics on the uptake of short chained pfas like pfba and ether pfas contaminants such as genx have not yet been reported necessitating the need for this investigation as seen in fig 3 a the longest breakthrough bv was observed in the presence of plfa the least charged dom and increasing the charge density of background dom fractions led to earlier breakthroughs for instance the breakthrough of genx on a860 resin decreased from 26 000 500 bv plfa to 20 500 500 bv srfa this is in agreement with the literature where greater removal of more charged dom fractions is documented increased removal of higher charged dom reduces the uptake sites on ix resin and consequently results in faster breakthrough note an earlier pfass breakthrough was observed in the presence of srha 5000 500 bv which is an evidence of pore blockage the evidence of pore blockage can also be observed in the doc removal data presented in fig 3 b for instance the doc removal for a860 decreased from 70 in srfa to 30 in the presence of srha see fig 3 b the pfas breakthrough was also modelled with influent doc to fit the exponential equation 4 b r e a k t h r o u g h b v α q k where q is defined as the load total contaminant meqs per resin meqs per liter and the term α and k are constants several scientific studies have adopted different models to relate carbon breakthrough as a function of influent doc concentration and uv absorbance anumol et al 2015 edzwald 2011 however this is slightly different from breakthrough estimations based of carbon adsorbents for an ion exchange system a meq based approach is a better descriptor from a fundamental perspective the obtained experimental values were utilized to estimate the average values of k and α see details in si table s 4 in general the experimental data agreed well when adopting a k value of 0 58 and ln α value of 8 97 r2 0 95 with the exception of srha pore blockage dixit et al 2019b zhang et al 2014 the changing breakthrough could thus be predicted and related to the initial pfas and dom characteristics i e charge density note that the resin pfas breakthrough for all assays except srha corresponded to 90 resin site occupancy total contaminant pfas doc uptake in meq divided by total resin capacity in meqs a key knowledge to predict pfas removal with other competing anions in natural waters capable of scavenging ion exchange sites such as sulphates nitrates etc 3 2 competitive interactions with dom isotherm studies were performed under varying resin dosages 9 1000 mg l or 0 04 4 5 ml l as described previously dixit et al 2019c with initial pfas concentration of 10 μg l and 5 mg c l srnom these dosages were selected as they offered a wide range of resin to contaminant loading 10 1 to 1 100 in meqs dixit et al 2018b the doc of 5 mg c l was selected as the natural recycled water from the vancouver convention centre and the collected surface water from middle river had a similar doc value and was already tested in one of our previous studies on surface waters dixit et al 2019a the isotherms conformed to a freundlich type behavior qe kf ce 1 n r2 0 99 details in si table s 5 in brief the 1 n values for pfoa and pfos were 0 83 0 03 and 0 79 0 04 in di waters respectively which were changed to 0 59 0 02 and 0 62 0 04 in the presence of 5 mg c l srnom respectively similarly the 1 n values for pfba pfbs and genx decreased from 0 93 0 02 0 96 0 02 and 0 82 0 05 to 0 70 0 02 pfba 0 59 0 03 pfbs and 0 60 0 03 genx respectively the k f values for all legacy long chained pfas decreased by approximately 7 folds in the presence of srnom 5 mg c l for instance the k f values for pfoa decreased from 793 26 μeq meq μeq l 1 n in di water to 101 4 μeq meq μeq l 1 n in srnom similarly the k f values for pfos were reduced from 745 23 μeq meq μeq l 1 n in di water to 115 17 μeq meq μeq l 1 n in 5 mg c l srnom a similar 7 fold decrease a similar 7 fold decrease was observed for genx as well see details in si however for shorter chained pfas the k f values decreased approximately 6 fold from 964 12 μeq meq μeq l 1 n to 164 2 μeq meq μeq l 1 n in srnom for pfba the equivalent background compound ebc model was employed to distinguish between the uptake of dom and the dom fraction that directly competes with pfas for uptake sites an equivalent background compound ebc the ebc parameters k ebc 1 n ebc and c oebc were determined as previously described dixit et al 2019b fig 4 a shows the concentration of competing compounds c oebc as a function of initial doc srnom for different pfas as observed increasing the concentration of background dom increases the concentration of competing dom fractions and thereby results in lower pfas uptake for all the compounds for instance according to the ebc model 0 3 μmol l of dom from srnom competed with pfoa at an initial doc of 2 mg c l this increased to 3 32 μmol l in the presence of 20 mg c l 10 fold increase if we assume an average molecular weight of dom fractions 1000 g mol and 55 carbon content of dom as previously adopted dixit et al 2019b 2018b these competing fractions approximate to 8 5 of the initial doc as competing fractions these values agree well with the published ebc studies which have identified that 5 10 of initial dom directly compete for active sites on activated carbon dixit et al 2019b matsui et al 2012 for compounds with the same functional group the concentration of ebc decreases with increasing charge density for instance at a doc of 5 mg c l the competitive fraction as estimated by ebc for pfba was approximately 5 which was estimated to be 8 5 for pfoa more importantly the concentrations of competing dom fractions c oebc for pfos is always lower than pfoa for example at a doc of 2 mg l 0 3 and 0 2 μmol l dom competes with pfoa and pfos respectively similarly at a doc of 10 mg l pfoa competes with 1 65 μmol l dom while only 1 32 μmol l dom competes with pfos p 0 05 estimated concentrations of ebc for pfba are also higher than pfbs at all times p 0 05 thus this study further validates the previously observed literature on preferential uptake of sulfonyl based pfas appleman et al 2014 mccleaf et al 2017 and also indicates that ebc model can be used to describe the competition of pfas with dom in an ix system additionally the higher ebc concentration for genx in comparison to pfba and pfbs compounds with similar charge density further indicates lower preference of ether acids in comparison to alkylic acids with carboxylic and sulfonyl functional groups as depicted in fig 4 b the concentration of competing compounds for genx increased with increasing charge density of background dom srfa 0 88 0 04 μmol l srnom 0 74 0 03 μmol l plfa 0 63 0 02 μmol l note that these concentrations also approximate to 4 5 9 0 of the initial dom concentration and agree well with the studies in the scientific literature as discussed earlier however the ebc model was not tested for srha as it has been reported to fail in the presence of pore blockage dixit et al 2019b 2018b 3 3 regeneration studies pfas and dom elution studies were performed under two scenarios of different brine concentrations and contact times optimal brine concentration and contact time are usually provided by the ix resin suppliers for packed bed operation e g 1 h contact time at 10 nacl for purolite a860 purolite 2017 however a860 is an organic scavenger resin tested only for dom removal to the best of our knowledge no scientific manufacturer study ever evaluated a860 for pfas removal purolite 2017 thus saturated resins recovered after 70 ng l breakthrough 25 000 bv at 5 mg c l water were employed to evaluate the impact of brine concentration and contact time on pfas recovery note that an efficient pfas recovery would also relate to a fresher ix resin with higher capacity and could thereby increase the service life of the ix resin multiple reuse 3 3 1 effect of brine concentration to examine the effect of brine concentration on pfas and dom recovery from saturated ix resins six different brine concentrations were used all studies were performed for a contact time of 2 h 1 l beaker at 150 rpm dixit et al 2018b fig 5 a depicts the pfas concentration detected in the regenerant brine as a function of initial nacl concentration increasing the initial nacl concentration from 1 to 5 w v resulted in an increase of pfas in the brine for instance pfoa recovery increased from 0 68 0 01 mg l to 1 42 0 02 mg l a twofold increase p 0 05 or from 34 to 70 recovery respectively similarly the pfos concentration under similar conditions increased from 0 56 0 02 mg l to 1 3 0 05 mg l or from 28 to 65 recovery p 0 05 further increase in salt concentration to 10 nacl resulted in 1 88 0 03 mg pfoa l 94 recovery and 1 8 0 02 mg pfos l 90 recovery in the spent brine more importantly at low nacl concentrations say at 1 and 5 the recovered concentrations of pfoa 0 68 0 01 mg l and 1 42 0 02 mg l was higher than those of pfos 0 56 0 02 mg l and 1 3 0 05 mg l further confirming a stronger bondage affinity between sulphonyl pfas and ix resin over carboxylic based pfas this can also be verified while observing pfba 0 73 0 04 mg l and pfbs 0 58 0 03 mg l concentrations in brine with 1 nacl note at brine concentrations of 10 and higher the eluted concentration of all pfas is 90 for all tested compounds indicating that 10 nacl is optimum for pfas recovery approximately 80 2 doc was also recovered for nacl concentrations of 10 15 and 20 this information is of importance to minimize brine consumption while maximizing ix recovery 3 3 2 effect of brine contact time the impact of regeneration time was evaluated by testing the pfas release with 10 nacl as recoveries plateaued for brine concentrations of greater 10 concentration under varied contact times fig 5 b illustrates that increasing contact time improved pfas elution especially up until 2 h for instance pfoa concentration in the spent brine increased from 0 24 0 01 mg l 12 recovery to 0 82 0 01 mg l 40 recovery and 1 62 0 03 mg l 80 recovery when contact time increased from 10 min to 30 min and 60 min respectively similarly pfos concentrations for these time intervals were 0 14 0 01 mg l 7 0 58 0 02 mg l 30 and 1 42 0 06 mg l 70 recovery respectively the concentration of genx in the spent brine also increased from 0 25 0 02 10 min of contact time to 1 66 0 06 60 min as shown in fig 5 b increasing the contact time to 2 h resulted in further release of pfas from the resin however there was little increase in the elution of pfas beyond 2 h suggesting that the elution was essentially completed after 2 h with 10 nacl concentration fig 5 c and d illustrate the effect of brine concentration and contact time on dom elution removing dom from the resin is critically important because of the need to minimize irreversible fouling on the resin as observed an effective regeneration with 10 nacl solution for a contact time of 2 h or more would ensure 90 dom recovery after 25 000 bv of operation note that we previously identified 90 pfas recovery under this scenario similar to the observation made with pfas dom recovery increased with increasing initial brine concentration with an optimized dosage identified at 10 nacl differences in dom recovery when tested under different pfas were also not statistically significant at 95 confidence level data not shown moreover an increase in the regeneration time using the supplier recommended 10 initial brine concentration up until 120 min ensured greater elution of dom corresponding to 87 one published study in the scientific literature has reported only up to 4 recovery of pfbs see si s 14 in regenerated ix brine using naoh on polyacrylic gel structured resins carter and farrell 2010 similarly 80 pfas recovery was reported using a mixture of 80 ch3oh and 1 nh4cl when testing multiple polystyrene resins with different functional groups zaggia et al 2016 this is clearly an environmental challenge considering the storage and handling issues for pfas loaded methanol bicarbonate and nacl used in this study are more suitable chemical from environmental perspectives in comparison to other salts used for ix regeneration maul et al 2014 further the regenerated resin in this study performed similarly to the fresh ix resins tested for subsequent cycles i e for another 5000 bv after regeneration without any indication of saturation or breakthrough further discussed in following sections however longer pilot studies would be needed to better assess the loss of regeneration performance over time finally with respect to the regeneration contact time a 2 h regeneration ensured 90 pfas and 85 dom elution and a feasible scenario for practical operation hence the results of this study indicate that ix can be regenerated and effectively reused for multiple cycles with an optimized regeneration strategy 10 nacl for 2 h contact time in a stirred reactor 3 4 studies in natural waters figs 6 and 7 illustrate the ix performance for pfas removal from di water srnom water as well as natural vcc and synthetic wastewater effluents the influent pfas concentrations were maintained at 10 μg l and were tested for 25 000 bv in sum the vcc water was composed of nitrate 26 mg l sulphate 32 mg l and phosphate 10 mg l which all were reduced to 2 mg n s p l after ix treatment see fig 7 c isotherm studies were performed under varying resin dosages 9 1000 mg l or 0 04 4 5 ml l with initial pfas concentration of 10 μg l in natural waters to examine the competitive interactions via ebc 2 5 4 5 of initial ion concentration further details in si in di waters no pfas was detected in the treated water until 25 000 bv of operation in the presence of background organics and other anions vcc wastewater effluent exhibited a breakthrough pfas 70 ng l after 17 000 500 bv for pfoa and 18 500 500 for pfos note that the breakthroughs for both natural and synthetic wastewaters were earlier than that of the srnom water at the same initial doc concentration 5 mg c l i e 22 000 500 bv for pfoa and 24 000 500 bv for pfos refer to figs 1 and 2 however it was identified that the resins are capable of capturing 90 of the sulphate 85 of phosphate and 70 of nitrate ions see details table s 6 of si therefore the faster breakthroughs in the wastewater effluents can be attributed to the presence of inorganic ions moreover sulphate was identified as the most competitive anion 3 9 competitive fractions estimated via ebc see table s 6 followed by phosphate 3 2 ebc competitive fraction and nitrate 2 5 ebc competitive fraction ions respectively note that regeneration with 10 nacl for 2 h of contact time was able to recover 85 of the inorganic ions n s p from all natural waters see fig 7 d more details in si sections s 8 and s 9 the recovery of sulphate was high about 90 which is an expected performance for a new resin nevertheless studies on on site off site treatment options for the spent brine are needed several strategies have been adopted in scientific literature to treat the spent ix brine and reuse it for further regeneration cycles for instance processes such as high temperature incineration dorrance et al 2017 biological reduction mcadam and judd 2008 membrane biofilm reactors mcadam et al 2010 capacitive deionization ng et al 2008 nanofiltration vaudevire et al 2013 and photo catalytic processes yang et al 2013 are among the alternatives proposed for brine treatment and recycling however presence of pfas may add additional challenges towards brine treatment and disposal and therefore should be the focus of future investigations in the present research the resins were regenerated after 22 000 bv with the optimized procedure identified earlier 10 nacl 2 h of contact following regeneration the resins exhibited comparable performances to fresh ix resins for all water matrices tested natural see fig 6 a and 6 b or synthetic see fig 6 c indicating a good match between laboratory studies performed on synthetic and natural waters moreover regeneration after 22 000 bv ensured an effective doc removal comparable to the results with fresh ix resins indicating an effective regeneration with high recovery 90 for pfoa pfba 85 for pfos pfbs genx and 80 for doc as depicted in fig 7 b hence it could be concluded that ix exhibits robust and simultaneous removal of dom and pfas from natural drinking and reuse waters while exhibiting excellent regeneration and reuse capabilities 4 conclusions the following conclusions were derived from this research 99 pfas removal can be achieved for more than 150 000 bv in di waters pfas c0 10 μg l individual concentrations increasing background doc concentrations result in faster ix resin saturation with breakthrough after 23 500 500 bv for genx in 5 mg c l change in background dom charge density resulted in a faster breakthrough with more charged srfa 20 500 500 bv for genx preferential uptake of pfas with sulphonyl functional groups over pfas with carboxylic and ether acids groups is observed breakthrough corresponds to 90 site saturation in meqs for all tested waters with the exception of srha where pore blockage was observed approximately 0 3 3 μmol l 5 8 5 of the dom depending upon initial concentration and charge density and 2 5 4 5 inorganic ions competed with pfas for uptake sites as estimated by the iast ebc model ix regeneration efficiency improved with increasing brine contact time but effectiveness plateaued for brine concentrations above 10 w v a regeneration with 10 nacl and 120 min contact time in a stirred reactor was identified as the best regeneration protocol for maximizing pfas and dom recovery regenerated ix resin exhibited similar pfas dom uptake behavior equivalent as fresh ix resin for the next 5000 bv of a second cycle of operation regeneration with 10 nacl with 2 h of contact time ensured an effective recovery of pfas 85 doc 80 sulphate 90 phosphate 85 and nitrate 85 ions from natural waters ix exhibit great potential for simultaneous pfas and doc removals from recycled wastewater effluents and natural surface waters

17774,thermal hydrolysis pretreatment thp and anaerobic digestion ad integrated thp ad process is a promising process for sludge management however the high ammonia production during the thp ad process severely affects system s stability and performance conductive materials are widely reported to stimulate ad thus they are potentially helpful in alleviating ammonia inhibition this study investigated the effects of three widely studied conductive materials i e zero valent iron zvi magnetite nanoparticles mag and powder activated carbon pac on thp ad process results showed that all the tested materials could effectively stimulate methanogenesis process under non ammonia inhibition conditions however upon ammonia stress these materials behaved distinctively with the best methanogenic performance in zvi group followed by mag group and even worsened inhibition occurred in pac group the mechanisms behind were investigated from two levels the reaction kinetics of each anaerobic digestion step and the responses of intracellular metabolism it is revealed that zvi effectively promoted all ad reactions especially the energy unfavorable propanoate and butanoate metabolism and overall methanogenesis in addition zvi likely acted as intracellular electron shuttles and the conjunction point of zvi to electron transfer system was identified as etfab quinone oxidoreductase on the contrary the declined methanogenic performance in pac group was attributed to selectively stimulated the growth of acetoclastic methanogen methanosaeta which is sensitive to ammonia toxicity the proteomic information further revealed that ammonia stress was unfavorable to the formation of direct interspecies electron transfer between syntrophic anaerobes overall the present study provides fundamental knowledge about the role of different conductive materials in ad systems from intracellular proteomic level graphical abstract image 1 keywords zero valent iron magnetite nanoparticles powder activated carbon quantitative proteomic analysis ammonia inhibition thermal hydrolysis pretreatment 1 introduction in modern wastewater treatment plants sludge treatment and disposal account for more than 50 of the operational cost appels et al 2008 yu et al 2016 thermal hydrolysis pretreatment thp prior to anaerobic digestion ad hereafter referred to as thp ad is widely accepted as one of the promising strategies in managing waste activated sludge with high efficiency and low operational cost appels et al 2008 however thp ad is often accompanied with inhibition induced from ammonia due to the degradation of protein rich compounds wilson and novak 2009 to address the problem various solutions have been developed such as air stripping zhang et al 2012 substrate dilution nielsen and angelidaki 2008 and ion exchange ding and sartaj 2016 but these strategies are either inefficient or costly conductive materials can stimulate methanogenic performance and volatile fatty acids consumption cruz viggi et al 2014 yang et al 2016 zhao et al 2017 thus they are potentially helpful in alleviating ammonia stress via lessening intermediates accumulation florentino et al 2019 lee et al 2019 yang et al 2018 the studies of conductive materials in ad process mainly focused on getting insights into the direct interspecies electron transfer diet between syntrophic partners by providing evidences of electroactive strains enrichment yan et al 2017 yin et al 2018 zhao et al 2017 or appurtenances i e pilin and c type cytochrome jing et al 2017 malvankar et al 2011 notwithstanding it may be an arbitrary conclusion without figuring out how conductive materials affect the intracellular metabolism first diet establishment is often associated with the enrichment of electroactive genus geobactor morita et al 2011 zhao et al 2016 which however are not observed in many putative diet functioned communities luo et al 2015 yan et al 2017 second diet cannot explain the commonly observed enhancement in hydrolysis which is related to the activity of extracellular enzymes rather than diet yan et al 2020a yin et al 2018 third the function of diet could vary with the operational condition e g mixing speed rather than merely the presence of conductive materials inaba et al 2019 therefore conductive materials may not only induce the diet based methanogenic pathway but also exert other influences on anaerobic digestion stress condition disturbs microbial intracellular metabolism which may form interactive effects with conductive materials on methanogenesis for example our previous study found that carbon nanotube could deteriorate methanogenic performance rather than expected positive effects under ammonia stressed conditions yan et al 2019 at high ammonia concentration zero valent iron zvi and magnetite stimulated the growth of hydrogenotrophic methanogens yang et al 2018 and syntrophic acetate oxidizing bacteria zhuang et al 2018 which cannot perform metabolism via diet pathway however many studies reported that the establishment of diet enhanced microbial resistance to ammonia toxicity florentino et al 2019 lee et al 2019 yang et al 2018 thus the effects of conductive materials on methanogenic performance are still controversial and vary with experimental conditions and material properties quantitative meta proteomics can provide intracellular transcription information and reflect the change of metabolism pathways thus is a promising tool to distinguish the role of different materials on microbial metabolism directly to our knowledge no study has compared the methanogenesis metabolic responses to different conductive materials under ammonia stressed conditions from proteomic level such information will be helpful in addressing the controversial conclusions and unraveling the true role of these materials in methanogenic performance aiming to reveal the effects of conductive materials on methanogenesis in thp ad systems this study monitored the methanogenic performance and solids reduction efficiency under both non ammonia and ammonia stress conditions in addition we specifically sought to compare the effects of three widely studied conductive materials i e zero valent iron magnetite nanoparticles powder activated carbon on metabolic processes transformation of different organics was closely monitored to distinguish the effects of the materials on respective process of anaerobic digestion a combined analysis of high throughput 16s rrna gene sequences and quantitative proteomics was performed to study the change of metabolic pathway and interpret the global proteomic dynamics in each microbial community we identified the changes of key microbes and metabolic pathways that resulted from ammonia inhibition and revealed the reason behind the divergent effects of conductive materials on methanogenic performance at proteomic level 2 materials and methods 2 1 seed feed sludge and materials the anaerobic seed sludge volatile solids vs 9 44 g l total ammonia nitrogen tan 0 36 g l n was collected from a local wastewater treatment plant thp waste activated sludge was used as the feeding sludge which was prepared according to our previous study lu et al 2018 briefly waste activated sludge was firstly warmed up to 70 c for 30 min then proceeded with thermal hydrolysis treatment in a vertical pressure steam sterilizer at 172 c for 30 min after cooling down the concentration of thp sludge was adjusted to vs 9 27 g l and tan of 0 61 g l n then stored at 4 c for further use the detailed characteristics of seed sludge and thp sludge can be found in table s1 pac magnetite and zvi were purchased from sigma aldrich the characteristics of pac are as follows brunauer emmett teller bet specific area of 850 m2 g particle size of 2 12 μm and purity 99 the bet surface area of magnetite nanoparticles is 60 m2 g and the particle size is 50 100 nm as characterized by transmission electron microscope the particle size of nanoscale zero valent iron is 60 80 nm and purity is 99 5 2 2 reactor setup and experimental operation the experiment was conducted in an automatic methane potential test system ii amtps ii bioprocess control company sweden each reactor has a working volume of 360 ml containing mixture of thp sludge and seed sludge with a ratio of 1 1 v v zvi magnetite

2020b the reactors without any materials was used as the control group each group was carried out in triplicate after purging with nitrogen for 8 min to create an anaerobic condition all reactors were sealed and operated at 35 c with continuous stirring at 60 rpm the experiment lasted for approximately 200 days including six stages with each stage operated for 30 days except for stage v 45 days at the beginning of each stage half of the sludge mixture 180 ml was replaced with thp sludge as substrate while the conductive materials were not topped up in order to explore the interactive effects of materials and ammonia on ad performance ammonium chloride was manually added into reactors from stage ii to vi to reach an initial total ammonia nitrogen tan in each stage as follows stage ii 1500 mg n l stage iii 2500 mg n l stage iv 3500 mg n l stage v 5500 mg n l and stage vi 5500 mg n l it is worth pointing out that from stage iv to stage v the tan concentration was purposely increased by 2000 mg n l to create ammonia shock condition and stage vi was the recovery stage without further increasing initial ammonia concentration detailed information about the initial concentrations of tan at each stage can be found in fig s1 during the operational period supernatant was periodically taken out to measure volatile fatty acids vfas organic compounds components ph and ammonium concentration

chromatograph with organic carbon nitrogen detection lc ocd ond as described in our previous study yan et al 2019 briefly the samples were first filtered through 0 45 μm nylon membrane filter then the lc ocd ond system was applied to quantify the following compounds hydrophobic compounds high molecular weight protein hmw pn high molecular weight polysaccharides hmw ps humic like substances hs building blocks low molecular weight protein lmw pn low molecular weight polysaccharides lmw ps low molecular weight lmw neutral and lmw acids yan et al 2019 total protein and polysaccharides were analyzed by using modified lowry method and phenol sulphuric acid method respectively the amount of lmw pn ps was calculated by subtracting hmw pn ps from total protein polysaccharides to keep the unit same 1g protein polysaccharides were converted to 0 545 g and 0 444 g of equivalent carbon based on chemical formulae of protein c400 h620 n100 o120 p1 s1 perrett 2007 and c6 h10 o5 2 3 3 microbial community analysis the genomic dna was extracted from the sludge samples using fastdna spin kit for soil mp biomedicals usa following the manufacturer s instructions amplicon libraries were constructed for pyrosequencing by using universal primer 515f 806r to target the v4 v5 regions of both the bacteria and archaea domains after removing the ambiguous bases and low quantity chimeric sequences the trimmed sequences were classified into operational taxonomic units otus within 3 divergence finally taxonomic classification was conducted by using the rdp classifier https rdp cme msu edu classifier principal coordinates analysis pcoa was conducted to study the beta diversity of microbial communities 2 3 4 tmt quantitative proteomic analysis 2 3 4 1 protein extraction digestion tmt labeling and mass spectrometry analysis the sludge samples were lysed at chilled 2 sds and 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate buffer abb after cooling on ice for 30 min the cell suspension was sonicated on ice and centrifuged for 30 min at 4 c and 15 000 rpm for removing the debris protein mixture was then purified by adding acetone for precipitation protein pellets were reconstituted in 300 μl uran buffer protease inhibitor cocktail and 8m urea in 100 mm abb buffer ph 8 and the concentration was determined using the bca based protein quantitation method proteomic analysis was similar to the method described by dembele et al 2019 briefly total protein of 100 μg from each sample was firstly reduced with 10 mm tris 2 carboxyethyl phosphine hydrochloride tcep at 37 c for 2h then the reduced proteins were alkylated with 20 mm iodoacetamide followed by digestion with trypsin at a trypsin protein ratio of 1 40 overnight at 37 c after quenching the reaction by adding 10 tfa the tryptic peptides were desalted by using sep pak c18 cartridges and dried in speedvac finally each sample was labeled with distinct tmt tags control 126 zvi 127 pac 129 mag 131 and pooled together for further fractions which were subsequently processed with lc ms ms using a q exactive mass spectrometer equipped with an online nano hplc system thermo scientific usa all samples for lc ms ms analysis were performed in triplicates 2 3 4 2 liquid chromatograph coupled to tandem mass spectrometry and data analysis proteome discoverer 1 4 1 14 thermo fisher ma software was used to analyze the lc ms ms raw data the mascot 2 2 embedded in proteome discoverer was applied to search raw data against the uniprot database tmt tags on lysine residues peptide n termini and carbamidomethylation of cysteine residues were set as fixed modifications and oxidation of methionine residues were set as variable modifications fragment mass tolerance of 0 6 da and peptide mass tolerance of 10 ppm were applied as monoisotopic and parent fragment ions respectively results were filtered based on a false discovery rate fdr of 1 to reduce the probability of false peptide the counted proteins contain at least two peptides passed the 95 confidence interval and are identified as master protein by a mascot probability analysis protein quantification was based on summing reporter ion counts across all matching peptide spectrum matches the ratio of proteins abundance in groups with materials over control group was calculated to figure out the effects of materials on the secretion of proteins and only the abundance ratio 1 2 or 0 83 was counted as differently expressed protein and further input for biological pathways analysis the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg database was used to annotate and group the differentially expressed proteins into biological pathways by using r package cluster profiler the pathways with fdr corrected p value 0 05 were represented in this study 2 3 5 other analysis the sludge reduction ratio is calculated according to the following eq 2 2 sludge reduction ratio vs initial vs end 360 vs feed 180 100 where vsinitial and vsend are the concentration of volatile solids vs in the reactor at the initial and end time of each stage vsfeed refers to vs of the feed thp sludge 360 and 180 refer to the working volume ml of reactors and the feed volume ml of thp sludge the vs and total solids ts were measured following the standard methods apha 2012 a gas chromatograph gc7890a aligent usa equipped with a flame ionization detector and db ffap fused silica capillary column was applied to analyze the constitutions of vfa tan was determined using nessler s reagent colorimetric method ph was measured using ph meter mettler toledo model s220 the concentration of free ammonia fa in the reactors was calculated based on the amount of tan and ph according to eq 3 hansen et al 1998 the ph and free ammonia concentration at the beginning of each stage can be found in table s3 3 nh 3 tan 1 10 ph 10 0 09018 2729 92 t k 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of different conductive materials on anaerobic digestion 3 1 1 effects of conductive materials on methanogenesis methanogenic performance is a key indicator of microbial activity according to fig 1 the methanogenic performance fluctuated with both tan concentration and the properties of supplemented conductive materials when tan 3500 mg n l all types of conductive materials i e zvi pac and mag could effectively stimulate both methanogenesis rate and methane generation potential typically during stage i the methanogenesis rate was enhanced by around 1 5 fold in the presence of conductive materials compared to the control group table 1 and fig 1 in the following two stages i e initial tan increased from 487 mg n l to 2500 mg n l the methanogenesis rate was still 0 5 fold higher in groups with conductive materials than that in the control group when tan 3500 mg n l the influences of the three conductive materials on methanogenic activity were significantly different at stage iv initial tan 3500 mg n l methanogenic activity was suppressed in all groups among which the greatest inhibition occurred in pac group with rmax reduced by 43 04 at stage v pac group again encountered the greatest suppression with the longest lag time of approximately 25 days while the corresponding value for control mag and zvi group were 14 89 days 10 86 days and 4 97 days table 1 respectively it is interesting to notice that in pac group although methane generation was severely delayed by shock inhibition initially rmax was not severely reduced suggesting microbial activity could restore to the previous level after the long term acclimation at stage vi methanogenic performance resumed in all groups with conductive materials particularly in pac group the lag time reduced to 5 56 days and the methanogenesis rate was even higher than that in stage iv on the other hand methanogenesis rate of the control group decreased by 20 19 compared to stage v though the lag time also reduced significantly therefore pac could exacerbate ammonia shock on methanogenesis but such impact can be mitigated at later stages as pac enhanced the activity of microbes which acclimatized to grow under high tan similar phenomenon was also observed in our previous study where carbon nanotube interrupted cells potassium transportation and reduced available atp for resisting ammonia inhibition yan et al 2019 contrary to pac zvi effectively promoted microbial anti toxic activity during ammonia inhibition stages stage v and stage vi with the least reduction in methanogenesis rate and shortest lag time fig 1 and table 1 similar to zvi mag also assisted microbes in anti toxicity reaction but not as effective as zvi it is noteworthy that the methane yield in groups with conductive materials was always significantly higher than that in control groups at all stages specifically from stage i to iv and stage vi methane yield in groups with conductive materials was above 290 ml g 1 vsfeed while the value was less than 200 ml g 1 vsfeed in control group in the inhibition stage v conductive materials also enhanced methane yield by more than 80 it is worth pointing out that due to shock inhibition at stage v actual methane yield reduced by 29 73 28 05 and 14 15 in control group pac group and mag group respectively on the contrary significant reduction of methane yield did not appear in zvi group therefore zvi was the most effective material in assisting microbes to resist ammonia inhibition 3 1 2 organic carbon source for the enhanced methane yield in groups with conductive materials as mentioned in section 3 1 1 conductive materials could significantly enhance methane generation even under ammonia stressed condition sludge reduction results revealed that it was the stimulated hydrolysis by conductive materials provided the essential carbon sources for the elevation in methane yield fig 2 as shown in fig 2 in the non inhibition stage i the sludge reduction ratio ranking from the highest to lowest were 73 89 pac 72 06 zvi 71 23 mag 48 92 control and during ammonia inhibited stage v the values were 68 89 zvi 68 7 mag 60 15 pac 42 21 control fig 2 besides the activities of hydrolytic enzymes i e protease and a glucosidase were also significantly higher in groups with conductive materials compared to control group fig s2 therefore conductive materials influenced the secretion of metabolic enzymes 3 2 transformation of organic compounds in ad systems with conductive materials anaerobic digestion can be mainly divided into three steps hydrolysis acidogenesis and methanogenesis based on the characterization of organic compounds protein polysaccharides humic like substances and building blocks are classified as hydrolytic products while volatile fatty acids vfa are acidification products the transformation of organic compounds at stage v was tracked to provide insights into the divergent effects of different conductive materials on methanogenic reactions under ammonia stressed condition fig 3 among all groups organics in zvi group exhibited the lowest accumulation and fastest consumption rates polysaccharides and proteins peaked earlier with lower concentration in zvi group compared to control group fig 3 hs and building blocks are refractory to be degraded due to their high molecular weight and aromatic based chemical structure the degradation of these refractory compounds was also significantly stimulated by zvi evidenced by faster degradation and less accumulation in zvi group i e the amount of hs in zvi was only 69 95 of that in control group similar to hydrolytic products the lowest accumulation of vfa was also observed in zvi group thus zvi effectively stimulated all reaction steps of thp ad process similar to zvi the presence of mag also greatly facilitated the metabolism of all types of organic compounds however its influence on the degradation of protein and polysaccharides was not as effective as zvi reflecting by significantly higher accumulation of protein and polysaccharides in mag group than those in zvi group on the contrary mag exhibited superior effects over zvi and pac on the degradation of hs and building blockings these two refractory compounds in mag group reached the peak amount earlier with lower values and were consumed faster compared to their transformation in other groups as for vfas faster accumulation and degradation rates of vfas were observed in mag group compared to control group however the accumulated vfas were significantly higher than those in zvi group suggesting that mag was not as effective as zvi in promoting the degradation of vfa under ammonia stressed condition contrary to zvi and mag the degradation of organics in pac group was severely repressed as evidenced by delayed peaking time and organics accumulation the peak abundance of hydrolytic products in pac group was 9 63 31 57 higher compared to control group although the presence of pac resulted in higher accumulation these products could be degraded rapidly once microbial activity recovered consequently the leftover organic compounds in pac was at the comparable level as control group as for vfas pac also delayed their peaking time and led to their higher accumulation than control group 61 02 mmol l vs 45 83 mmol l noteworthy acetate was the main contributor to the gap of the accumulated vfas its peaking time in pac groups delayed by 20 days and 35 13 higher compared to control group 45 08 mmol l in pac group vs 33 36 mmol l in control group however upon recovery the accumulated acetate can be quickly consumed within 12 days in pac group suggesting that strains with the capability of consuming acetate were enriched during the lag time 3 3 microbial community alteration to further explore the influence of different materials on methanogenic process microbial communities of non ammonia inhibited stage i and ii and ammonia inhibited stage v were investigated all rarefaction curve of the out numbers at 0 03 distance approached plateau fig s3 demonstrating that the sequence result is reliable to represent microbial information of each sample the weighted principal co ordinate analysis pcoa showed that samples of stage v were separated from samples of stage i and ii and the microbial community of stage v in zvi group was distinct from that in other groups fig s4 thus ammonia inhibition was the predominant factor affecting microbial communities and zvi exerted the greatest influence on microbial constituents under ammonia stressed condition figs s4 and s5 and page 3 in si given the fact that methanogenic performances exhibited the greatest differences among all groups upon ammonia inhibition the metabolic characteristics of genera that enriched in each group at stage v were explored to understand the main effects of materials on bacterial communities in the following sections 3 3 1 effects of conductive materials on bacterial constitutions under ammonia stressed condition genus level in consistent with pcoa results bacterial constituent of zvi group exhibited the greatest difference compared to other groups fig 4 syntrophomonas a typical fatty acids oxidizing and ammonia tolerant bacterium has the highest abundance in zvi group subspecies of syntrophomonas contain menaquinone which can act as electron conduit and facilitate electron transfer between membrane complexes of syntrophic microbes schmidt et al 2013 therefore its enrichment could contribute to the fastest vfa removal in zvi group tepidimicrobium and anaerosphaera are typical proteolytic microbes that hydrolyze protein and fermenting amino acids with vfas and ammonia as the end products niu et al 2009 interestingly the greatest abundance of tepidimicrobium and the lowest abundance of anaerosphaera concurrently happened in zvi groups tepidimicrobium is more tolerant to ammonia stress than anaerosphaera dai et al 2016 meng et al 2018 therefore zvi likely selectively stimulated the growth of species with higher capability in resisting ammonia inhibition genera that enriched in mag group were quite different from zvi group compared to other groups an iron reducing bacterium clostridium sensu stricto was the most abundant in mag group starkey and halvorson 1927 many iron reducing bacteria including clostridium sensu stricto are reported with the capability of degrading recalcitrant compounds köchling et al 2017 lim 2010 clostridium sensu stricto could effectively degrade the refractory compounds with ferric irons as the electron acceptors thus resulting in the least amount of hs and building blocks in mag group as observed in fig 3 tepidanaerobacter a type of acetate oxidizing bacterium showed the highest abundance in mag group at stage v similar to zvi group the hydrolysis bacterium tepidimicrobium was also greatly enriched in mag group thus mag specifically stimulated the growth of strains involving in recalcitrant organics degradation syntrophic acetate oxidation and organics hydrolysis as for pac group the hydrolytic genus sporanaerobacter hernandez eugenio et al 2002 had the greatest enrichment compared to control group significant higher hydrolysis degree and methane yield occurred pac group therefore sporanaerobacter could play an important role in enhancing the hydrolysis of thp sludge 3 3 2 effects of conductive materials on archaea constituents under ammonia stressed condition genus level in all groups archaea were mainly composed of five methanogens i e methanobacterium methaospirillum methanoculleus methanosaeta and methanosarcina fig 5 from stage ii to v the total relative abundance of methanogens decreased by 61 63 66 13 and 56 45 in control mag and pac groups respectively on the contrary it increased by 68 81 in zvi group methanogens directly involve in methane generation and are the most sensitive anaerobes toward ammonia inhibition therefore the superior role in maintaining the growth of the methanogens under inhibitory condition was ascribed to the key contributor to the best methanogenic performance in zvi group methanosacina was the main cause of the divergent archaea constituents among all groups and its relative abundance in stage v was 17 85 3 75 2 33 and 0 93 in zvi mag control and pac groups respectively noteworthy methanosacina was the most predominant methanogens in all analyzed samples except for pac group at stage v methanosacina is the only genus that is known for methane generation via three methanogenic pathways buan et al 2011 rotaru et al 2014 in this study it could perform methane generation via both acetate decarboxylation and carbon reduction methanogenic pathway as discussed in section 3 4 1 as for pac group the typical acetoclastic methanogen methanosaeta was the only stimulated methanogens upon ammonia inhibition which replaced methanosarcina as the most predominant archaea at stage v hydrogenotrophic methanogens are more robust in resisting ammonia inhibition compared to acetoclastic methanogens angelidaki and ahring 1993 koster and lettinga 1984 and methanosaeta was known for being sensitive to ammonia inhibition ziganshin et al 2016 in consistent with previous studies lee et al 2019 wang et al 2020 zhuang et al 2018 hydrogenotrophic methanogens and methanosacina were prevailing over acetoclastic methanosaeta except for pac group at stage v in pac group the selective growth of methanosaeta portends that a longer acclimation time would be needed for the methanogenesis recovering to recover from ammonia inhibition in consistent with the hypothesis pac group showed the longest lag time and the worst methanogenic performance upon ammonia inhibition fig 1 3 4 changes of proteomic profiles of the microbial communities 3 4 1 effects of conductive materials on metabolic pathways metaproteomic analysis was carried out to zoom in the effects of materials on intracellular metabolism under ammonia stressed condition stage v clearly the three conductive materials exhibited distinctive effects on metabolic pathways fig 6 as show in fig 6 most enzymes involved in degrading butanoate and propanoate were upregulated demonstrating that the presence of zvi and mag could effectively stimulate the degradation of the two fatty acids butanoate and propanoate are key intermediates produced during degrading complex organics and are further degraded into acetate and h2 co2 then to ch4 during the methanogenic process thermodynamically propanoate and butanoate are more difficult to be degraded compared to other fermentation intermediates as the oxidation reaction of butanoate and propanoate is energetically unfavorable with standard change in gibbs free energy of δg⁰ 45 5 kj mol and δg⁰ 76 1 kj mol thauer et al 1977 respectively in methanogenic process bio removal of propanoate and butanoate determines system stability cohen et al 1982 nielsen et al 2007 thus the promoted degradation of the important metabolic intermediates i e propanoate and butanoate was accounted as one of the major contributors to the superior performance in zvi and mag groups under ammonia stressed condition on the other hand the effects of pac on the two metabolic pathways are insignificant enzymes involving in methane metabolism were also significantly influenced by conductive materials in zvi group thirteen out of fifteen differently expressed enzymes were originated from the enriched genus methanosarcina which were associated with either acetate decarboxylation or and carbon dioxide reduction methanogenic pathways figs 5 and 6 and table s4 specifically enzymes associated to acetate decarboxylation pathway i e k00192 k00193 k00194 k00197 in zvi group were 1 45 2 33 times higher than those in control group fig 6 enzymes tetrahydromethanopterin s methyltransferase subunit a g h k00577 k00583 k00584 which specifically catalyze the formation of methyl coenzyme m and tetrahydromethanopterin in the carbon dioxide reduction methanogenic pathway were also enhanced significantly at the presence of zvi in addition the subunits of methyl coenzyme m reductase k00399 k00401 and k00402 involving in catalyzing the final step of methane generation in both methanogenic pathways also exhibited higher abundance in zvi group compared to control group fig 6 therefore zvi effectively stimulated methane generation from both acetate and carbon dioxides contrary to zvi group that most of the upregulated methanogenic enzymes were originated from the enriched methanosarcina the influenced methanogenic enzymes were not ascribed to a single genus in mag and pac groups in mag group enzymes k00192 k00197 and k00925 involved in acetate decarboxylation pathway were enhanced while the carbon dioxide reduction methanogenic pathway associated enzyme methylenetetrahydromethanopterin dehydrogenase k00319 was repressed fig 6 this phenomenon suggests that mag promoted methane synthesis from acetate rather than from carbon dioxide similarly wang et al 2020 reported that the presence of mag could enhance the tolerance of aceticlastic methanogenesis to ammonia stress as for pac group the key enzyme k00319 onsite carbon dioxide reduction methanogenic pathway was significantly reduced hydrogen removal is important for resisting ammonia inhibition in ad system wang et al 2015 therefore the low abundance of hydrogenotrophic methanogens fig 5 and the repressed expression of enzymes in carbon dioxide reduction methanogenic pathway fig 6 could both contribute to the deteriorated methanogenesis performance in stage v of pac group in diet methanogenic pathway methanogens accept electrons from its syntrophic partner and directly use it for methane production following the carbon dioxide reduction methanogenic pathway as hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis wang et al 2018 deit based methanogenesis was characterized with the high transcript abundance of genes involving in the carbon dioxide reduction methanogenic pathway holmes et al 2017 yin et al 2018 however the abundance of protein involved in carbon dioxide reduction methanogenic pathway was reduced in both mag and pac groups suggesting that both hydrogenotrophic and diet based methanogenesis were suppressed under ammonia stressed condition however it is difficult to determine whether zvi can still promote methane generation via diet pathway due to the concurrence of the upregulated enzymes involving in both acetate decarboxylation or and carbon dioxide reduction methanogenic pathways on the other hand zvi may stimulate intracellular electron transport via replacing enzymes that functioned in transferring electrons this is concluded based on the un synchronously expressed electron transfer flavoproteins etf subunits and the corresponding electron shuttles that conduct electrons from etf complex to cell membrane in detail etf complex functions in receiving electrons from butyryl coa dehydrogenases then the electrons will be transferred to membrane bounded quinone oxidoreductase with the assistance of electron shuttles in zvi group significant enhancement of etfa k03521 and etfb k03522 located on the cytoplasm of the enriched genus syntrophomonas was observed table s4 however the electron shuttle etfab quinone oxidoreductase q0az32 which conjuncts with the two etf subunits in linking the electron flow from butyryl coa dehydrogenases to menaquinone pool of membrane was significantly reduced in the presence of zvi table s4 similarly it was reported that nano scale conductive materials adhered to cell surfaces and incorporated into cells as electron conduit to facilitate intracellular metabolism but the replaced protein failed to be identified fu et al 2019 in this study it is highly possible that zvi had replaced etfab quinone oxidoreductase in shuttling electron transfer this is the first time identifying the conjunction protein that is replaced by conductive materials in promoting intracellular direct electron transfer 3 4 2 microbial responses to ammonia stress besides metabolic pathways a series of enzymes were secreted as a response to toxicological effect or anti toxicity reaction the inhibitory effects from ammonia is due to its interruption on cell potassium transport and atp is needed for detoxification reactions according to fig 6 the three materials also exerted significantly different effects on the oxidative phosphorylation pathway including both upregulated and downregulated enzymes in addition the differentially expressed enzymes were proportional to the relative abundance of their originated microbes figs 5 and 6 and table s4 this fact suggests that the quantitative difference of the enzymes sourced from the discrepancy in microbial abundance rather than the external environment in other words conductive materials may not directly affect microbial energy generation process additionally the abundance of proteins involved in translation ribosomal structure and chaperones and folding catalysts also varied significantly with the material property proteins synthesis consume a lion s share of energy and cellular resources so translation is generally repressed under stressed conditions liu and qian 2014 richter et al 2010 in zvi group the abundance of proteins related to translation and ribosomal structure was significantly lower than those in control group fig 6 indicating that zvi was favorable to intracellular energy saving under ammonia inhibition the mrna encoding chaperonins which protect cells from damage and facilitate post stress recovery can be selectively translated when facing protein denaturation panniers 1994 richter et al 2010 in zvi group the abundance of chaperonins was disproportional to their originated strains figs 4 and 6 and table s4 typically compared to control group the abundance of methanosarcina and syntrophomonas in zvi group increased by 6 6 times and 3 2 times respectively while the chaperonin k04043 of methanosarcina only enhanced by 1 41 times and chaperonins of syntrophomonas exhibited little difference between the two groups as the secretion of chaperonins is a response to protein denaturation this phenomenon suggests that the proteins originated from the two strains were not severely impaired therefore zvi specifically enriched strains with higher capability in tolerating ammonia stress notwithstanding these two groups of enzymes in pac group exhibited opposite trends suggesting the adverse role of pac on microbial activity upon ammonia inhibition as for mag group proteins of translation and ribosomal structure proteins decreased significantly while the change of chaperones was not significant this phenomenon implies that mag functioned in activating the energy saving process rather than specifically enriching strains with strong capability for resisting ammonia inhibition 3 5 role of the conductive materials in anaerobic digestion of thp sludge according to the results ammonia concentration can greatly influence the behavior and impacts of conductive materials on anaerobic digestion of thp sludge under non ammonia stressed condition all materials could significantly enhance the methanogenesis rate methane generation and solids reduction however upon ammonia inhibition the three conductive materials responded differently briefly zvi could effectively alleviate ammonia inhibition on microbial activity resulting in the least interruption of methanogenesis the highest sludge reduction rate and the shortest lag time mag also imposed positive effects on methanogenesis but not as effective as zvi on the contrary pac worsened the shock inhibition of ammonia on methanogenesis the divergent effects of the conductive materials on methanogenesis were further revealed from two levels ad reaction steps and intracellular metabolism firstly zvi and mag could effectively promote hydrolysis i e the production and consumption of protein polysaccharides and hs as well as acidogenesis processes i e the production and consumption of volatile fatty acids whereas the presence of pac amplified ammonia inhibition on the two processes evidenced by higher accumulation of intermediates in particular zvi and mag enhanced butanoate and propanoate metabolisms the key reactions related to anaerobic digestion performance while pac did not exhibit such capabilities secondly the carbon dioxide reduction methanogenic pathway was upregulated only in zvi group while its downregulation was observed in both mag and pac group electrons accepted from diet will follow the same carbon dioxide reduction methanogenic pathway as hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis for methane synthesis studies have demonstrated that conductive materials stimulated diet based methanogenesis can bring out the upregulation of genes related to carbon dioxide reduction methanogenic pathways holmes et al 2017 yin et al 2018 the downregulation of the carbon dioxide reduction methanogenic pathway in mag and pac group suggests that diet based methanogenesis was suppressed in the two groups under ammonia stressed condition upon ammonia inhibition pac group selectively stimulated the growth of ammonia toxic methanogens methanosaeta which is sensitive to ammonia inhibition therefore longer time was needed for microbial community to adapt to ammonia stress and severer shock inhibition occurred in pac group direct electron transfer is an energy transferring process in which free electrons flow from electron donors to acceptors not by using molecular carriers but being shuttled by conductive materials dube and guiot 2015 liu et al 2012 lovley 2017 it is thus important to know which point that conductive materials connected with the electron transfer chains for better understanding the direct electron transfer process for the first time this study unveiled the conjunction point i e etfab quinone oxidoreductase that nano sized zvi join anaerobic digestion in facilitating intracellular direct electron transfer furthermore the changing trends of proteins associated with translation ribosomal structure and chaperones and folding catalysts indicate that 1 zvi could function in activating energy saving process and enrich ammonia stress tolerant strains to resist toxic effects 2 mag might mainly work in improving the general energy saving activity to protect microbes from inhibition rather than selectively acclimatizing microbial community to adapt to ammonia stress and 3 pac impaired metabolic activities and ability to resist ammonia inhibition 4 conclusions this study explored the role of different conductive materials on methanogenic process under ammonia stressed condition results showed that both zvi and mag could effectively alleviate ammonia inhibition but pac worsened methanogenic performance upon shock inhibition from ammonia the predominant reason of the divergent performance among groups with conductive materials was ascribed to their different effects on ad steps especially the propanoate and butanoate metabolism and the methanogenic pathways in addition diet methanogenesis pathway was suppressed under ammonia stressed condition despite of the presence of conductive materials mag and pac the findings provide an essential foundation for future application of conductive materials in natural and engineered anaerobic

17774,thermal hydrolysis pretreatment thp and anaerobic digestion ad integrated thp ad process is a promising process for sludge management however the high ammonia production during the thp ad process severely affects system s stability and performance conductive materials are widely reported to stimulate ad thus they are potentially helpful in alleviating ammonia inhibition this study investigated the effects of three widely studied conductive materials i e zero valent iron zvi magnetite nanoparticles mag and powder activated carbon pac on thp ad process results showed that all the tested materials could effectively stimulate methanogenesis process under non ammonia inhibition conditions however upon ammonia stress these materials behaved distinctively with the best methanogenic performance in zvi group followed by mag group and even worsened inhibition occurred in pac group the mechanisms behind were investigated from two levels the reaction kinetics of each anaerobic digestion step and the responses of intracellular metabolism it is revealed that zvi effectively promoted all ad reactions especially the energy unfavorable propanoate and butanoate metabolism and overall methanogenesis in addition zvi likely acted as intracellular electron shuttles and the conjunction point of zvi to electron transfer system was identified as etfab quinone oxidoreductase on the contrary the declined methanogenic performance in pac group was attributed to selectively stimulated the growth of acetoclastic methanogen methanosaeta which is sensitive to ammonia toxicity the proteomic information further revealed that ammonia stress was unfavorable to the formation of direct interspecies electron transfer between syntrophic anaerobes overall the present study provides fundamental knowledge about the role of different conductive materials in ad systems from intracellular proteomic level graphical abstract image 1 keywords zero valent iron magnetite nanoparticles powder activated carbon quantitative proteomic analysis ammonia inhibition thermal hydrolysis pretreatment 1 introduction in modern wastewater treatment plants sludge treatment and disposal account for more than 50 of the operational cost appels et al 2008 yu et al 2016 thermal hydrolysis pretreatment thp prior to anaerobic digestion ad hereafter referred to as thp ad is widely accepted as one of the promising strategies in managing waste activated sludge with high efficiency and low operational cost appels et al 2008 however thp ad is often accompanied with inhibition induced from ammonia due to the degradation of protein rich compounds wilson and novak 2009 to address the problem various solutions have been developed such as air stripping zhang et al 2012 substrate dilution nielsen and angelidaki 2008 and ion exchange ding and sartaj 2016 but these strategies are either inefficient or costly conductive materials can stimulate methanogenic performance and volatile fatty acids consumption cruz viggi et al 2014 yang et al 2016 zhao et al 2017 thus they are potentially helpful in alleviating ammonia stress via lessening intermediates accumulation florentino et al 2019 lee et al 2019 yang et al 2018 the studies of conductive materials in ad process mainly focused on getting insights into the direct interspecies electron transfer diet between syntrophic partners by providing evidences of electroactive strains enrichment yan et al 2017 yin et al 2018 zhao et al 2017 or appurtenances i e pilin and c type cytochrome jing et al 2017 malvankar et al 2011 notwithstanding it may be an arbitrary conclusion without figuring out how conductive materials affect the intracellular metabolism first diet establishment is often associated with the enrichment of electroactive genus geobactor morita et al 2011 zhao et al 2016 which however are not observed in many putative diet functioned communities luo et al 2015 yan et al 2017 second diet cannot explain the commonly observed enhancement in hydrolysis which is related to the activity of extracellular enzymes rather than diet yan et al 2020a yin et al 2018 third the function of diet could vary with the operational condition e g mixing speed rather than merely the presence of conductive materials inaba et al 2019 therefore conductive materials may not only induce the diet based methanogenic pathway but also exert other influences on anaerobic digestion stress condition disturbs microbial intracellular metabolism which may form interactive effects with conductive materials on methanogenesis for example our previous study found that carbon nanotube could deteriorate methanogenic performance rather than expected positive effects under ammonia stressed conditions yan et al 2019 at high ammonia concentration zero valent iron zvi and magnetite stimulated the growth of hydrogenotrophic methanogens yang et al 2018 and syntrophic acetate oxidizing bacteria zhuang et al 2018 which cannot perform metabolism via diet pathway however many studies reported that the establishment of diet enhanced microbial resistance to ammonia toxicity florentino et al 2019 lee et al 2019 yang et al 2018 thus the effects of conductive materials on methanogenic performance are still controversial and vary with experimental conditions and material properties quantitative meta proteomics can provide intracellular transcription information and reflect the change of metabolism pathways thus is a promising tool to distinguish the role of different materials on microbial metabolism directly to our knowledge no study has compared the methanogenesis metabolic responses to different conductive materials under ammonia stressed conditions from proteomic level such information will be helpful in addressing the controversial conclusions and unraveling the true role of these materials in methanogenic performance aiming to reveal the effects of conductive materials on methanogenesis in thp ad systems this study monitored the methanogenic performance and solids reduction efficiency under both non ammonia and ammonia stress conditions in addition we specifically sought to compare the effects of three widely studied conductive materials i e zero valent iron magnetite nanoparticles powder activated carbon on metabolic processes transformation of different organics was closely monitored to distinguish the effects of the materials on respective process of anaerobic digestion a combined analysis of high throughput 16s rrna gene sequences and quantitative proteomics was performed to study the change of metabolic pathway and interpret the global proteomic dynamics in each microbial community we identified the changes of key microbes and metabolic pathways that resulted from ammonia inhibition and revealed the reason behind the divergent effects of conductive materials on methanogenic performance at proteomic level 2 materials and methods 2 1 seed feed sludge and materials the anaerobic seed sludge volatile solids vs 9 44 g l total ammonia nitrogen tan 0 36 g l n was collected from a local wastewater treatment plant thp waste activated sludge was used as the feeding sludge

sealed and operated at 35 c with continuous stirring at 60 rpm the experiment lasted for approximately 200 days including six stages with each stage operated for 30 days except for stage v 45 days at the beginning of each stage half of the sludge mixture 180 ml was replaced with thp sludge as substrate while the conductive materials were not topped up in order to explore the interactive effects of materials and ammonia on ad performance ammonium chloride was manually added into reactors from stage ii to vi to reach an initial total ammonia nitrogen tan in each stage as follows stage ii 1500 mg n l stage iii 2500 mg n l stage iv 3500 mg n l stage v 5500 mg n l and stage vi 5500 mg n l it is worth pointing out that from stage iv to stage v the tan concentration was purposely increased by 2000 mg n l to create ammonia shock condition and stage vi was the recovery stage without further increasing initial ammonia concentration detailed information about the initial concentrations of tan at

stage can be found in table s3 3 nh 3 tan 1 10 ph 10 0 09018 2729 92 t k 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of different conductive materials on anaerobic digestion 3 1 1 effects of conductive materials on methanogenesis methanogenic performance is a key indicator of microbial activity according to fig 1 the methanogenic performance fluctuated with both tan concentration and the properties of supplemented conductive materials when tan 3500 mg n l all types of conductive materials i e zvi pac and mag could effectively stimulate both methanogenesis rate and methane generation potential typically during stage i the methanogenesis rate was enhanced by around 1 5 fold in the presence of conductive materials compared to the control group table 1 and fig 1 in the following two stages i e initial tan increased from 487 mg n l to 2500 mg n l the methanogenesis rate was still 0 5 fold higher in groups with conductive materials than that in the control group when tan 3500 mg n l the influences of the three conductive materials on methanogenic activity were significantly different at stage iv initial tan 3500 mg n l methanogenic activity was suppressed in all groups among which the greatest inhibition occurred in pac group with rmax reduced by 43 04 at stage v pac group again encountered the greatest suppression with the longest lag time of approximately 25 days while the corresponding value for control mag and zvi group were 14 89 days 10 86 days and 4 97 days table 1 respectively it is interesting to notice that in pac group although methane generation was severely delayed by shock inhibition initially rmax was not severely reduced suggesting microbial activity could restore to the previous level after the long term acclimation at stage vi methanogenic performance resumed in all groups with conductive materials particularly in pac group the lag time reduced to 5 56 days and the methanogenesis rate was even higher than that in stage iv on the other hand methanogenesis rate of the control group decreased by 20 19 compared to stage v though the lag time also reduced significantly therefore pac could exacerbate ammonia shock on methanogenesis but such impact can be mitigated at later stages as pac enhanced the activity of microbes which acclimatized to grow under high tan similar phenomenon was also observed in our previous study where carbon nanotube interrupted cells potassium transportation and reduced available atp for resisting ammonia inhibition yan et al 2019 contrary to pac zvi effectively promoted microbial anti toxic activity during ammonia inhibition stages stage v and stage vi with the least reduction in methanogenesis rate and shortest lag time fig 1 and table 1 similar to zvi mag also assisted microbes in anti toxicity reaction but not as effective as zvi it is noteworthy that the methane yield in groups with conductive materials was always significantly higher than that in control groups at all stages specifically from stage i to iv and stage vi methane yield in groups with conductive materials was above 290 ml g 1 vsfeed while the value was less than 200 ml g 1 vsfeed in control group in the inhibition stage v conductive materials also enhanced methane yield by more than 80 it is worth pointing out that due to shock inhibition at stage v actual methane yield reduced by 29 73 28 05 and 14 15 in control group pac group and mag group respectively on the contrary significant reduction of methane yield did not appear in zvi group therefore zvi was the most effective material in assisting microbes to resist ammonia inhibition 3 1 2 organic carbon source for the enhanced methane yield in groups with conductive materials as mentioned in section 3 1 1 conductive materials could significantly enhance methane generation even under ammonia stressed condition sludge reduction results revealed that it was the stimulated hydrolysis by conductive materials provided the essential carbon sources for the elevation in methane yield fig 2 as shown in fig 2 in the non inhibition stage i the sludge reduction ratio ranking from the highest to lowest were 73 89 pac 72 06 zvi 71 23 mag 48 92 control and during ammonia inhibited stage v the values were 68 89 zvi 68 7 mag 60 15 pac 42 21 control fig 2 besides the activities of hydrolytic enzymes i e protease and a glucosidase were also significantly higher in groups with conductive materials compared to control group fig s2 therefore conductive materials influenced the secretion of metabolic enzymes 3 2 transformation of organic compounds in ad systems with conductive materials anaerobic digestion can be mainly divided into three steps hydrolysis acidogenesis and methanogenesis based on the characterization of organic compounds protein polysaccharides humic like substances and building blocks are classified as hydrolytic products while volatile fatty acids vfa are acidification products the transformation of organic compounds at stage v was tracked to provide insights into the divergent effects of different conductive materials on methanogenic reactions under ammonia stressed condition fig 3 among all groups organics in zvi group exhibited the lowest accumulation and fastest consumption rates polysaccharides and proteins peaked earlier with lower concentration in zvi group compared to control group fig 3 hs and building blocks are refractory to be degraded due to their high molecular weight and aromatic based chemical structure the degradation of these refractory compounds was also significantly stimulated by zvi evidenced by faster degradation and less accumulation in zvi group i e the amount of hs in zvi was only 69 95 of that in control group similar to hydrolytic products the lowest accumulation of vfa was also observed in zvi group thus zvi effectively stimulated all reaction steps of thp ad process similar to zvi the presence of mag also greatly facilitated the metabolism of all types of organic compounds however its influence on the degradation of protein and polysaccharides was not as effective as zvi reflecting by significantly higher accumulation of protein and polysaccharides in mag group than those in zvi group on the contrary mag exhibited superior effects over zvi and pac on the degradation of hs and building blockings these two refractory compounds in mag group reached the peak amount earlier with lower values and were consumed faster compared to their transformation in other groups as for vfas faster accumulation and degradation rates of vfas were observed in mag group compared to control group however the accumulated vfas were significantly higher than those in zvi group suggesting that mag was not as effective as zvi in promoting the degradation of vfa under ammonia stressed condition contrary to zvi and mag the degradation of organics in pac group was severely repressed as evidenced by delayed peaking time and organics accumulation the peak abundance of hydrolytic products in pac group was 9 63 31 57 higher compared to control group although the presence of pac resulted in higher accumulation these products could be degraded rapidly once microbial activity recovered consequently the leftover organic compounds in pac was at the comparable level as control group as for vfas pac also delayed their peaking time and led to their higher accumulation than control group 61 02 mmol l vs 45 83 mmol l noteworthy acetate was the main contributor to the gap of the accumulated vfas its peaking time in pac groups delayed by 20 days and 35 13 higher compared to control group 45 08 mmol l in pac group vs 33 36 mmol l in control group however upon recovery the accumulated acetate can be quickly consumed within 12 days in pac group suggesting that strains with the capability of consuming acetate were enriched during the lag time 3 3 microbial community alteration to further explore the influence of different materials on methanogenic process microbial communities of non ammonia inhibited stage i and ii and ammonia inhibited stage v were investigated all rarefaction curve of the out numbers at 0 03 distance approached plateau fig s3 demonstrating that the sequence result is reliable to represent microbial information of each sample the weighted principal co ordinate analysis pcoa showed that samples of stage v were separated from samples of stage i and ii and the microbial community of stage v in zvi group was distinct from that in other groups fig s4 thus ammonia inhibition was the predominant factor affecting microbial communities and zvi exerted the greatest influence on microbial constituents under ammonia stressed condition figs s4 and s5 and page 3 in si given the fact that methanogenic performances exhibited the greatest differences among all groups upon ammonia inhibition the metabolic characteristics of genera that enriched in each group at stage v were explored to understand the main effects of materials on bacterial communities in the following sections 3 3 1 effects of conductive materials on bacterial constitutions under ammonia stressed condition genus level in consistent with pcoa results bacterial constituent of zvi group exhibited the greatest difference compared to other groups fig 4 syntrophomonas a typical fatty acids oxidizing and ammonia tolerant bacterium has the highest abundance in zvi group subspecies of syntrophomonas contain menaquinone which can act as electron conduit and facilitate electron transfer between membrane complexes of syntrophic microbes schmidt et al 2013 therefore its enrichment could contribute to the fastest vfa removal in zvi group tepidimicrobium and anaerosphaera are typical proteolytic microbes that hydrolyze protein and fermenting amino acids with vfas and ammonia as the end products niu et al 2009 interestingly the greatest abundance of tepidimicrobium and the lowest abundance of anaerosphaera concurrently happened in zvi groups tepidimicrobium is more tolerant to ammonia stress than anaerosphaera dai et al 2016 meng et al 2018 therefore zvi likely selectively stimulated the growth of species with higher capability in resisting ammonia inhibition genera that enriched in mag group were quite different from zvi group compared to other groups an iron reducing bacterium clostridium sensu stricto was the most abundant in mag group starkey and halvorson 1927 many iron reducing bacteria including clostridium sensu stricto are reported with the capability of degrading recalcitrant compounds köchling et al 2017 lim 2010 clostridium sensu stricto could effectively degrade the refractory compounds with ferric irons as the electron acceptors thus resulting in the least amount of hs and building blocks in mag group as observed in fig 3 tepidanaerobacter a type of acetate oxidizing bacterium showed the highest abundance in mag group at stage v similar to zvi group the hydrolysis bacterium tepidimicrobium was also greatly enriched in mag group thus mag specifically stimulated the growth of strains involving in recalcitrant organics degradation syntrophic acetate oxidation and organics hydrolysis as for pac group the hydrolytic genus sporanaerobacter hernandez eugenio et al 2002 had the greatest enrichment compared to control group significant higher hydrolysis degree and methane yield occurred pac group therefore sporanaerobacter could play an important role in enhancing the hydrolysis of thp sludge 3 3 2 effects of conductive materials on archaea constituents under ammonia stressed condition genus level in all groups archaea were mainly composed of five methanogens i e methanobacterium methaospirillum methanoculleus methanosaeta and methanosarcina fig 5 from stage ii to v the total relative abundance of methanogens decreased by 61 63 66 13 and 56 45 in control mag and pac groups respectively on the contrary it increased by 68 81 in zvi group methanogens directly involve in methane generation and are the most sensitive anaerobes toward ammonia inhibition therefore the superior role in maintaining the growth of the methanogens under inhibitory condition was ascribed to the key contributor to the best methanogenic performance in zvi group methanosacina was the main cause of the divergent archaea constituents among all groups and its relative abundance in stage v was 17 85 3 75 2 33 and 0 93 in zvi mag control and pac groups respectively noteworthy methanosacina was the most predominant methanogens in all analyzed samples except for pac group at stage v methanosacina is the only genus that is known for methane generation via three methanogenic pathways buan et al 2011 rotaru et al 2014 in this study it could perform methane generation via both acetate decarboxylation and carbon reduction methanogenic pathway as discussed in section 3 4 1 as for pac group the typical acetoclastic methanogen methanosaeta was the only stimulated methanogens upon ammonia inhibition which replaced methanosarcina as the most predominant archaea at stage v hydrogenotrophic methanogens are more robust in resisting ammonia inhibition compared to acetoclastic methanogens angelidaki and ahring 1993 koster and lettinga 1984 and methanosaeta was known for being sensitive to ammonia inhibition ziganshin et al 2016 in consistent with previous studies lee et al 2019 wang et al 2020 zhuang et al 2018 hydrogenotrophic methanogens and methanosacina were prevailing over acetoclastic methanosaeta except for pac group at stage v in pac group the selective growth of methanosaeta portends that a longer acclimation time would be needed for the methanogenesis recovering to recover from ammonia inhibition in consistent with the hypothesis pac group showed the longest lag time and the worst methanogenic performance upon ammonia inhibition fig 1 3 4 changes of proteomic profiles of the microbial communities 3 4 1 effects of conductive materials on metabolic pathways metaproteomic analysis was carried out to zoom in the effects of materials on intracellular metabolism under ammonia stressed condition stage v clearly the three conductive materials exhibited distinctive effects on metabolic pathways fig 6 as show in fig 6 most enzymes involved in degrading butanoate and propanoate were upregulated demonstrating that the presence of zvi and mag could effectively stimulate the degradation of the two fatty acids butanoate and propanoate are key intermediates produced during degrading complex organics and are further degraded into acetate and h2 co2 then to ch4 during the methanogenic process thermodynamically propanoate and butanoate are more difficult to be degraded compared to other fermentation intermediates as the oxidation reaction of butanoate and propanoate is energetically unfavorable with standard change in gibbs free energy of δg⁰ 45 5 kj mol and δg⁰ 76 1 kj mol thauer et al 1977 respectively in methanogenic process bio removal of propanoate and butanoate determines system stability cohen et al 1982 nielsen et al 2007 thus the promoted degradation of the important metabolic intermediates i e propanoate and butanoate was accounted as one of the major contributors to the superior performance in zvi and mag groups under ammonia stressed condition on the other hand the effects of pac on the two metabolic pathways are insignificant enzymes involving in methane metabolism were also significantly influenced by conductive materials in zvi group thirteen out of fifteen differently expressed enzymes were originated from the enriched genus methanosarcina which were associated with either acetate decarboxylation or and carbon dioxide reduction methanogenic pathways figs 5 and 6 and table s4 specifically enzymes associated to acetate decarboxylation pathway i e k00192 k00193 k00194 k00197 in zvi group were 1 45 2 33 times higher than those in control group fig 6 enzymes tetrahydromethanopterin s methyltransferase subunit a g h k00577 k00583 k00584 which specifically catalyze the formation of methyl coenzyme m and tetrahydromethanopterin in the carbon dioxide reduction methanogenic pathway were also enhanced significantly at the presence of zvi in addition the subunits of methyl coenzyme m reductase k00399 k00401 and k00402 involving in catalyzing the final step of methane generation in both methanogenic pathways also exhibited higher abundance in zvi group compared to control group fig 6 therefore zvi effectively stimulated methane generation from both acetate and carbon dioxides contrary to zvi group that most of the upregulated methanogenic enzymes were originated from the enriched methanosarcina the influenced methanogenic enzymes were not ascribed to a single genus in mag and pac groups in mag group enzymes k00192 k00197 and k00925 involved in acetate decarboxylation pathway were enhanced while the carbon dioxide reduction methanogenic pathway associated enzyme methylenetetrahydromethanopterin dehydrogenase k00319 was repressed fig 6 this phenomenon suggests that mag promoted methane synthesis from acetate rather than from carbon dioxide similarly wang et al 2020 reported that the presence of mag could enhance the tolerance of aceticlastic methanogenesis to ammonia stress as for pac group the key enzyme k00319 onsite carbon dioxide reduction methanogenic pathway was significantly reduced hydrogen removal is important for resisting ammonia inhibition in ad system wang et al 2015 therefore the low abundance of hydrogenotrophic methanogens fig 5 and the repressed expression of enzymes in carbon dioxide reduction methanogenic pathway fig 6 could both contribute to the deteriorated methanogenesis performance in stage v of pac group in diet methanogenic pathway methanogens accept electrons from its syntrophic partner and directly use it for methane production following the carbon dioxide reduction methanogenic pathway as hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis wang et al 2018 deit based methanogenesis was characterized with the high transcript abundance of genes involving in the carbon dioxide reduction methanogenic pathway holmes et al 2017 yin et al 2018 however the abundance of protein involved in carbon dioxide reduction methanogenic pathway was reduced in both mag and pac groups suggesting that both hydrogenotrophic and diet based methanogenesis were suppressed under ammonia stressed condition however it is difficult to determine whether zvi can still promote methane generation via diet pathway due to the concurrence of the upregulated enzymes involving in both acetate decarboxylation or and carbon dioxide reduction methanogenic pathways on the other hand zvi may stimulate intracellular electron transport via replacing enzymes that functioned in transferring electrons this is concluded based on the un synchronously expressed electron transfer flavoproteins etf subunits and the corresponding electron shuttles that conduct electrons from etf complex to cell membrane in detail etf complex functions in receiving electrons from butyryl coa dehydrogenases then the electrons will be transferred to membrane bounded quinone oxidoreductase with the assistance of electron shuttles in zvi group significant enhancement of etfa k03521 and etfb k03522 located on the cytoplasm of the enriched genus syntrophomonas was observed table s4 however the electron shuttle etfab quinone oxidoreductase q0az32 which conjuncts with the two etf subunits in linking the electron flow from butyryl coa dehydrogenases to menaquinone pool of membrane was significantly reduced in the presence of zvi table s4 similarly it was reported that nano scale conductive materials adhered to cell surfaces and incorporated into cells as electron conduit to facilitate intracellular metabolism but the replaced protein failed to be identified fu et al 2019 in this study it is highly possible that zvi had replaced etfab quinone oxidoreductase in shuttling electron transfer this is the first time identifying the conjunction protein that is replaced by conductive materials in promoting intracellular direct electron transfer 3 4 2 microbial responses to ammonia stress besides metabolic pathways a series of enzymes were secreted as a response to toxicological effect or anti toxicity reaction the inhibitory effects from ammonia is due to its interruption on cell potassium transport and atp is needed for detoxification reactions according to fig 6 the three materials also exerted significantly different effects on the oxidative phosphorylation pathway including both upregulated and downregulated enzymes in addition the differentially expressed enzymes were proportional to the relative abundance of their originated microbes figs 5 and 6 and table s4 this fact suggests that the quantitative difference of the enzymes sourced from the discrepancy in microbial abundance rather than the external environment in other words conductive materials may not directly affect microbial energy generation process additionally the abundance of proteins involved in translation ribosomal structure and chaperones and folding catalysts also varied significantly with the material property proteins synthesis consume a lion s share of energy and cellular resources so translation is generally repressed under stressed conditions liu and qian 2014 richter et al 2010 in zvi group the abundance of proteins related to translation and ribosomal structure was significantly lower than those in control group fig 6 indicating that zvi was favorable to intracellular energy saving under ammonia inhibition the mrna encoding chaperonins which protect cells from damage and facilitate post stress recovery can be selectively translated when facing protein denaturation panniers 1994 richter et al 2010 in zvi group the abundance of chaperonins was disproportional to their originated strains figs 4 and 6 and table s4 typically compared to control group the abundance of methanosarcina and syntrophomonas in zvi group increased by 6 6 times and 3 2 times respectively while the chaperonin k04043 of methanosarcina only enhanced by 1 41 times and chaperonins of syntrophomonas exhibited little difference between the two groups as the secretion of chaperonins is a response to protein denaturation this phenomenon suggests that the proteins originated from the two strains were not severely impaired therefore zvi specifically enriched strains with higher capability in tolerating ammonia stress notwithstanding these two groups of enzymes in pac group exhibited opposite trends suggesting the adverse role of pac on microbial activity upon ammonia inhibition as for mag group proteins of translation and ribosomal structure proteins decreased significantly while the change of chaperones was not significant this phenomenon implies that mag functioned in activating the energy saving process rather than specifically enriching strains with strong capability for resisting ammonia inhibition 3 5 role of the conductive materials in anaerobic digestion of thp sludge according to the results ammonia concentration can greatly influence the behavior and impacts of conductive materials on anaerobic digestion of thp sludge under non ammonia stressed condition all materials could significantly enhance the methanogenesis rate methane generation and solids reduction however upon ammonia inhibition the three conductive materials responded differently briefly zvi could effectively alleviate ammonia inhibition on microbial activity resulting in the least interruption of methanogenesis the highest sludge reduction rate and the shortest lag time mag also imposed positive effects on methanogenesis but not as effective as zvi on the contrary pac worsened the shock inhibition of ammonia on methanogenesis the divergent effects of the conductive materials on methanogenesis were further revealed from two levels ad reaction steps and intracellular metabolism firstly zvi and mag could effectively promote hydrolysis i e the production and consumption of protein polysaccharides and hs as well as acidogenesis processes i e the production and consumption of volatile fatty acids whereas the presence of pac amplified ammonia inhibition on the two processes evidenced by higher accumulation of intermediates in particular zvi and mag enhanced butanoate and propanoate metabolisms the key reactions related to anaerobic digestion performance while pac did not exhibit such capabilities secondly the carbon dioxide reduction methanogenic pathway was upregulated only in zvi group while its downregulation was observed in both mag and pac group electrons accepted from diet will follow the same carbon dioxide reduction methanogenic pathway as hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis for methane synthesis studies have demonstrated that conductive materials stimulated diet based methanogenesis can bring out the upregulation of genes related to carbon dioxide reduction methanogenic pathways holmes et al 2017 yin et al 2018 the downregulation of the carbon dioxide reduction methanogenic pathway in mag and pac group suggests that diet based methanogenesis was suppressed in the two groups under ammonia stressed condition upon ammonia inhibition pac group selectively stimulated the growth of ammonia toxic methanogens methanosaeta which is sensitive to ammonia inhibition therefore longer time was needed for microbial community to adapt to ammonia stress and severer shock inhibition occurred in pac group direct electron transfer is an energy transferring process in which free electrons flow from electron donors to acceptors not by using molecular carriers but being shuttled by conductive materials dube and guiot 2015 liu et al 2012 lovley 2017 it is thus important to know which point that conductive materials connected with the electron transfer chains for better understanding the direct electron transfer process for the first time this study unveiled the conjunction point i e etfab quinone oxidoreductase that nano sized zvi join anaerobic digestion in facilitating intracellular direct electron transfer furthermore the changing trends of proteins associated with translation ribosomal structure and chaperones and folding catalysts indicate that 1 zvi could function in activating energy saving process and enrich ammonia stress tolerant strains to resist toxic effects 2 mag might mainly work in improving the general energy saving activity to protect microbes from inhibition rather than selectively acclimatizing microbial community to adapt to ammonia stress and 3 pac impaired metabolic activities and ability to resist ammonia inhibition 4 conclusions this study explored the role of different conductive materials on methanogenic process under ammonia stressed condition results showed that both zvi and mag could effectively alleviate ammonia inhibition but pac worsened methanogenic performance upon shock inhibition from ammonia the predominant reason of the divergent performance among groups with conductive materials was ascribed to their different effects on ad steps especially the propanoate and butanoate metabolism and the methanogenic pathways in addition diet methanogenesis pathway was suppressed under ammonia stressed condition despite of the presence of conductive materials mag and pac the findings provide an essential foundation for future application of conductive materials in natural and engineered anaerobic
