1320,two of the most important retention processes for per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas in groundwater likely are sorption and matrix diffusion the objective of this study was to model concentration and mass discharge of one pfas perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos with matrix diffusion processes incorporated using data from a highly chemically and geologically characterized site when matrix diffusion is incorporated into the remchlor md model for pfos at this research site it easily reproduces the field data for three key metrics concentration mass discharge and total mass however the no matrix diffusion model produced a much poorer match additionally after about 40 years of groundwater transport field data and the remchlor md model both showed the majority 80 of the measured pfos mass that exited the source zones was located in downgradient low permeability zones due to matrix diffusion as such most of the pfos mass is not available to immediately migrate downgradient via advection in the more permeable sands at this site which has important implications for monitored natural attenuation mna plume expansion over the next 50 years is forecasted to be limited from a 350 m plume length in 2017 to 550 m in 2070 as matrix diffusion will attenuate groundwater plumes by slowing their expansion this phenomenon is important for constituents that do not degrade such as pfos compared to those susceptible to degradation overall this work shows that matrix diffusion is a relevant process in environmental pfas persistence and slows the rate of plume expansion over time keywords pfas pfos matrix diffusion fate and transport modeling remchlor md remediation 1 introduction pfas have recently appeared as a chemical of emerging concern in soil and groundwater several quantitative metrics indicate the potential scale of future cleanup of groundwater sites with pfas could be extensive newell et al 2020 specifically a symposium of 60 pfas experts concluded that due to their mobility persistence and technical limitations to remediation pfas present more complex challenges as compared to other chemicals simon et al 2019 while simon et al 2019 noted there are some uncertainties regarding pfas transport parameters conservatives assumptions can be used to evaluate different scenarios for pfas transport developing appropriate fate and transport modeling approaches for pfas is critical for evaluating risk at impacted sites as well as understanding what remedies or site management options are viable for addressing that risk without the ability to make planning level predictions about plume behavior over time it is difficult for decision makers to avoid expensive cleanup technologies such as groundwater pump and treat as a conservative measure it also limits the technical justification for selecting less intensive strategies for pfas such as monitored natural attenuation mna mna already faces a significant hurdle in that pfas are not expected to transform beyond perfluoroalkyl acids pfaas under natural environmental conditions however retention based processes can form the basis for applying monitored natural attenuation to manage pfas impacts in groundwater newell et al 2021a newell et al 2021b assuming an understanding of how these processes influence pfas plumes can be established two of the most important retention processes for pfas in groundwater are likely to be sorption and matrix diffusion the extent to which sorption contributes to retardation of pfas during groundwater transport is a function of aquifer properties but also the complex and diverse physical chemical properties of pfas as a chemical class higgins and luthy 2007 anderson et al 2019 adamson et al 2022 because they exhibit surfactant like properties pfas can partition to air water interfaces that are present within the pore space in the unsaturated zone pfas can sorb hydrophobically to naturally occurring organic matter on soils to non aqueous phase liquids napls and through electrostatic interactions with soil mineral phases because pfas are typically released to the environment as a mixture with various different charges some are anions some cations some zwitterions and hydrophobicity individual pfas can have a range of sorption characteristics for example long chained pfas will usually sorb more readily than short chained pfas and desorption hysteresis and competitive sorption among different pfas have the potential to impact pfas transport sima and jaff√© 2021 similarly cationic and zwitterionic pfas will tend to sorb more readily to soils than anionic pfas such as pfos and pfoa guelfo and higgins 2013 li et al 2018 given the negative surface charges associated with many soil particles e g clays the role of matrix diffusion in groundwater transport was first identified by foster 1975 in the chalk aquifer in southern and eastern england this term is used to describe the concentration gradient driven mechanism where chemicals are exchanged from media with high permeability to regions of lower permeability or low k as described in sale et al 2013 diffusion sudicky and frind 1982 and gillham et al 1984 initially showed how matrix diffusion can slow and attenuate solutes moving in heterogeneous geologic settings another key consequence of matrix diffusion is the chemical release from low k zones via back diffusion outward diffusion and slow advection once the concentrations in the transmissive zones drop either due to natural or engineered reduction in source strength or direct remediation of groundwater plumes chapman and parker 2005 nrc 2005 sale et al 2008 nrc 2013 sale et al 2013 usepa 2019 you et al 2020 brooks et al 2021 factors controlling the rate of diffusion to and from low k regions include diffusion and slow advection diffusion incorporates the difference in concentrations between the transmissive and low k media the amount of time chemicals are in contact with low k zones the diffusivity of the chemicals and the porosity tortuosity of the low k media sale et al 2013 modeling matrix diffusion can prove challenging because there are only limited number of commercially available analytical groundwater models that account for matrix diffusion e g chapman et al 2012 farhat et al 2012 muskus and falta 2018 falta et al 2018 and numerical models can result in erroneous results if the vertical discretization is too coarse chapman and parker 2005 farhat et al 2020 however failing to account for matrix diffusion in models leads to faulty predictions thus hindering effective remediation strategies adamson and newell 2014 oswer 2019 there has been extensive research on trying to model pfas transport in the vadose zone e g brusseau 2018 brusseau et al 2019 costanza et al 2019 silva et al 2020 guo et al 2020 however there are very few reports of groundwater modeling of pfas fate and transport in the saturated zone particularly those that evaluate plume behavior over time in a recent study by farhat et al 2022 the remchlor md model falta et al 2018 was applied to explore the general behavior of non degrading groundwater plumes like pfos and pfoa particularly with regard to retention based attenuation caused by matrix diffusion processes the resulting analysis concluded that non degrading plumes would continue to expand over time assuming a constant source but matrix diffusion will result in lower concentrations and smaller footprints for instance in a 100 year travel time scenario modeled with matrix diffusion the resulting pfos plume length was only 20 as long as a scenario without matrix diffusion farhat et al 2022 these results help highlight the potential relevance of matrix diffusion on pfas fate and transport which along with sorption and partial biotransformation could be expected to influence pfas retention within heterogeneous saturated zones this study presents a novel application of a matrix diffusion model remchlor md to simulate the history and potential future migration of an actual pfos plume at a well characterized research site here pfos transport was modeled using site specific data from a highly chemically and geologically characterized fire training area fta where significant pfas mass was encountered in low k soils nickerson et al 2020 adamson et al 2020 because the current state of knowledge suggests that pfos does not degrade in the environment the modeling focuses on non destructive attenuation processes such as sorption and matrix diffusion as such the objective of this study was to model concentration and mass discharge of pfas with matrix diffusion processes incorporated to show how these influence plume length and remedial performance this work establishes as with almost all contaminants that contaminant storage and release to and from low k zones matrix diffusion slow advection is also relevant in pfas source zones and plumes as with many contaminant releases failing to consider matrix diffusion has the potential to lead to flawed assessments of risk and or selection of remedies for pfas releases 2 site background the study area is a former firefighting training facility located within a military installation in the united states a high resolution site characterization program was conducted in 2017 consisting of 16 locations selected from within the source and downgradient areas here site characterization was conducted in the upper 10 15 m of a surficial aquifer using a hydraulic profiling tool hpt as well as collecting co located depth discrete soil and groundwater samples using a geoprobe drilling rig a detailed description of the field sample collection methods and analytical protocols are provided in nickerson et al 2020 a total of 58 groundwater samples were collected and analyzed for 79 pfas at oregon state university osu while 105 soil samples were collected and analyzed for 136 pfas at colorado school of mines csm adamson et al 2020 nickerson et al 2020 both the groundwater and soil data were used to quantify the following pfas groupings 1 pfos 2 pfoa 3 total pfaas 4 total cations and zwitterions 5 total precursors and 6 total pfas 2 1 hydrogeology based on results from subsurface drilling using a hydraulic profiling tool hpt and logging of cores collected during the field characterization there are four main soil types in the water bearing unit using the universal soil classification system usda 2012 these were 1 poorly graded sands sp 2 sands with fines sm 3 silt ml and 4 clays with low plasticity cl specifically the subsurface at this site is composed primarily of permeable sands and less permeable silts and clays adamson et al 2020 sands dominate the first 1 to 2 m of the site forming a thin vadose zone as a shallow aquifer is encountered within the first two meters of the subsurface laterally extensive clays appear at depths between 3 and 4 5 m with a second layer of silt clay present at around 10 m nickerson et al 2020 additionally based on site documents describing the hydrologic setting the aquifer consists of undifferentiated terrace and shallow marine deposits of pliocene to holocene age associated with glacial and inter glacial periods usgs 2000 fig 1 shows a cross section of the study site along the direction of groundwater flow depicting key soil types and stratigraphy groundwater flows in a north to northeast direction from the study area towards a river nickerson et al 2020 two slug test results were available for two monitoring wells screened in the most transmissive geologic media poorly graded sands sp as defined by the universal soil classification system farhat et al 2012 here slug test results together had geomean hydraulic conductivity of 2 4 10 3 cm s 6 8 ft day consultant report 2017 when combined with an estimated effective porosity of 0 10 and the measured hydraulic gradient of 0 00375 m m the estimated seepage velocity for the most transmissive sands was 28 m year 93 ft year the effective porosity is a key parameter for the transport model applied at this site the environmental consulting company that performed the slug tests used an effective porosity of 0 05 for their seepage velocity calculations citing while silty sand may have an average porosity of between 25 and 60 percent the effective porosity is usually estimated at about 5 percent consultant report 2017 these effective porosities while lower than some groundwater modeling studies are supported by the mobile porosity model developed by payne et al 2008 that was based on approximately 15 detailed tracer tests at remediation sites similarly kulkarni et al 2020 evaluated 141 boring logs from 43 sites to develop an empirical estimate of a representative mobile porosity resulting in a value of approximately 0 11 additionally three spatial compartments were used to define the pfas plume source transect near downgradient transect and far downgradient transect figs 2 and 3 depict the relative distribution of the different soil types in the three spatial compartments 2 2 pfas source and plume characteristics between 1968 and 1991 site personnel used aqueous film forming foam afff while training to extinguish fires in a pit measuring approximately 36 m in diameter adamson et al 2020 nickerson et al 2020 given the known presence of pfas in afff a site characterization was carried out starting in 2017 in an effort to determine the spatial distribution of pfas in the shallow aquifer adamson et al 2020 nickerson et al 2020 while afff was only released within the training pit impacts to adjacent areas is possible due to overspray adamson et al 2020 nickerson et al 2020 soils from the study area have previously been the focus of a 1994 remediation project for non pfas chemicals where petroleum impacted soils were removed from the pit and remediated at a mobile low thermal desorption treatment unit adamson et al 2020 nickerson et al 2020 following treatment the soils were returned to the pit based on depth discrete groundwater sampling fig 4 depicts the pfos groundwater plume at the site fig 5 uses depth discrete soil sampling data to show a three dimensional depiction of pfos mass in subsurface soil 3 methods 3 1 pfas mass and mass discharge estimation process adamson et al 2020 employed the voxler interpolation tool version 4 6 913 golden software 2019 to develop a three dimensional grid of the pfas data and soil types as described by adamson et al 2020 a total of 58 groundwater samples were analyzed for 79 pfas compounds by dr jennifer fields lab at oregon state university osu these data were kriged using gms and then used by the voxler tool to develop a three dimensional model of soil concentrations for key pfas and pfas classes and for soil type the voxler tool was then able to calculate masses of these categories in different regions of the site e g source near downgradient far downgradient and in different soil types a total of 105 soil samples were analyzed for 136 pfas compounds by dr chris higgins lab at the colorado school of mines csm the voxler model was used to construct a three dimensional model of concentrations for key pfas and pfas categories which was then used to calculate mass discharge across the three transects adamson et al 2020 a visualization of the pfos subsurface mass generated by the voxler model is shown in fig 5 additionally the pfas compartment model provided a quantitative dataset showing where pfas were distributed in the subsurface in 2017 including how much was in the source vs plume in the transmissive vs low k geologic media and in the aqueous phase vs sorbed phase see figs 1 2 and 3 respectively in adamson et al 2020 here the source was defined by knowledge of historic site activities and their spatial footprint as well as site characterization data confirming significantly higher concentrations additionally the mass discharge data showed the rate that pfas are transported through the transmissive zone at three different vertical transects of the source plume system to establish the physio chemical natural attenuation of pfas at this site for the current modeling study pfos was selected as the pfas of interest because it was the most prevalent pfas representing 40 kg of the total 222 kg of total pfas at the site adamson et al 2020 key pfos mass in various soil types from the voxler tool are shown in table 1 the tool also yielded three pfos mass discharge values for the three transects shown in fig 2 source transect 0 m from source 0 31 kg yr 87 through sp soils near downgradient 114 m from source 0 13 kg yr 98 through sp soils far downgradient 190 m from source 0 0053 kg yr 85 through sp soils for estimating the source mass discharge history that was applicable at this site several commonly used options that involve simple functions over time were initially considered e g newell and adamson 2005 constant source over time until the source mass is depleted step function linearly decaying source until the source mass is depleted and exponentially decaying source based on the source mass a more sophisticated source model that was also considered was the power function model sometimes referred to as the gamma model where the change in source strength over time is a function of the change of source mass over time to a defined power gamma rao et al 2001 falta et al 2005 assigning a value of zero for gamma gives a step function for the source strength 0 5 gives a linear decline in source strength and a gamma of 1 0 gives an exponential decay other values give a hybrid between these different models with values greater than 1 0 giving long slowly changing extended source strength tails to determine which of these simple models was best suited for modeling the pfos source strength over time at this research site an initial exploratory evaluation of the 2017 mass and mass discharge data was performed the best available site records indicated that fire fighting training activities at the site with afff started in approximately 1968 although the records are not definitive in general pfas containing fire fighting foams for the u s military were introduced in the late 1960s 3m 2021 so much earlier dates of release to groundwater are unlikely later releases to groundwater are possible particularly considering the time it takes for pfas from the vadose zone source to migrate to groundwater e g guo et al 2020 by the year 2017 49 years later the mass of total pfas in the downgradient plume was measured to be 117 kg and the mass discharge from the source upgradient side gradient zones was estimated to be 3 6 kg yr adamson et al 2020 while these are not precise estimates due to uncertainties in the historical record and in the mass and mass discharge calculations they can form the basis for developing a hypothesis regarding the source strength history for example a constant mass discharge of 3 6 kg yr of pfas over 49 years 1968 to 2017 would have delivered 176 kg of pfas to the downgradient plume about 1 5 times the measured mass a higher source in 1968 that declines to 3 6 kg yr in 2017 would have introduced even more pfas mass to the downgradient plume increasing the discrepancy between modeled and measured pfas mass this information suggested the best model for fitting these data was a constant source step function however even the constant source model overpredicted the measured downgradient plume pfas mass in 2017 therefore the initiation of pfas mass discharge to the downgradient plume was hypothesized to start nine years after 1968 in 1977 to yield a calculated downgradient mass of 144 kg 3 6 kg yr x 40 years compared to the measured mass of 120 kg it is possible that fire fighting training was started at a low level in 1968 but then increased significantly in the late 1970s the better match with the 40 year time may also be caused by the slow vertical migration of the pfas through the vadose zone where it might have partitioned to the air water interfaces and then via slow downward radial flow to groundwater no degradation of total pfas was assumed because any transformation of pfas precursors would have been matched by a similar mass of pfaa s generated from the transformation the matches for individual pfas varied the constant source model overestimated pfos mass in the downgradient plume by 44 but underestimated pfoa by about 50 the match between constant source model and the measured field data were relatively close for pfaas and total precursors data not shown because of this variability between different pfas and pfas classes the timing analysis based on the total pfas mass discharge and measured downgradient total pfas mass was used for the modeling analysis overall this comparison concludes that unlike the mass discharge patterns typically observed at chlorinated solvent or benzene toluene ethylbenzene xylene btex sites e g see newell et al 2014 this pfas site may have had a relatively constant mass discharge from the source for the past 40 years because pfos was the key focus of this modeling research an additional evaluation was performed to increase the confidence in these field based mass estimates an independent analysis of the potential amount of pfos that could have been introduced into the subsurface was performed based on historical use data at firefighting training sites as described in adamson et al 2020 supplemental information this historical usage estimate indicated it was possible that about 81 kg of pfos could have been released during fire fighting training events during the lifetime of the site the 81 kg is within a factor of two compared to the more reliable measured pfos mass of 40 kg a relatively close match considering the uncertainties in the historic usage estimate additional uncertainties include the transformation of precursors to pfos historically or ongoing as no precursors or biotic transformation to pfos has been accounted for in mass estimates in the source or downgradient because rate data are relatively limited adamson et al 2020 in addition the site data presented in adamson et al 2020 showed that precursors were primarily located in the source area such that transformation to pfos within the plume would be minimal 3 2 remchlor md model overview these data were used to evaluate a novel application of a recently released estcp groundwater fate and transport model remchlor md falta et al 2018 farhat et al 2018 for the pfos plume at the site while designed for chlorinated solvent sites remchlor md can be adapted to simulate groundwater transport at pfas sites remchlor md consists of a simple source model coupled to a semi analytical plume transport model the source model uses a power law relationship to define the long term relationship between the remaining source mass and the mass discharge leaving the source at any time the plume model uses a semi analytical method with defined gridblocks to simulate advection dispersion retardation and degradation in addition the plume model can simulate matrix diffusion effects for two different geologic configurations 1 low k aquitards in contact with transmissive geologic media and 2 the effect of low k layers and lenses embedded within the transmissive media the embedded matrix diffusion term was derived by falta and wang 2017 and muskus and falta 2018 by adapting heat conduction models developed by vinsome and westerveld 1980 to use this feature in the model users enter transmissive vs low k layering information contained in existing geologic boring logs into the model s heterogeneity calculator which then calculates three key matrix diffusion variables used by the model 1 the volume fraction of low permeability material 2 the characteristic maximum matrix diffusion length and 3 the surface area of the transmissive low k interfaces within each defined gridblock with the high resolution field data reliable estimates of the mass of different pfas and pfas groups were used to bound how much pfas was released at the afff fire training facility and the original mass discharge to groundwater in 1968 with these values the evolution attenuation of a pfas source and plume considering matrix diffusion was reconstructed potentially for the first time the remchlor md model uses a linear isotherm to describe sorption of the chemicals in both the transmissive and low k zones of the model and cannot use any other type of isotherm pfas sorption is the focus of considerable research and a variety of isotherms have been used to represent sorption such as freundlich langmuir virial and linear isotherms sima and jaff√© 2021 evaluated the appropriateness of various isotherm types and stated that at low pfas concentrations a linear kd may be sufficient depending on soil pfas solvent interaction citing four studies milinovic et al 2015 miao et al 2017 wei et al 2017 li et al 2019 as support for this statement it should be noted that each of these four studies cited in sima and jaff√© 2021 had different conclusions about which models fit their experiment data better and had different upper concentration thresholds for use of a linear isotherm more importantly the four papers did not suggest a single freundlich model with a specific freundlich n value that would be appropriate for modeling a particular site therefore for the remchlor md model the use of the linear isotherm was considered an appropriate approach for this early attempt to modeling pfas in groundwater using the remchlor md model the change in the pfas compartment model was simulated starting from the source reaching groundwater around 1978 to the near present 2017 where the model can be adjusted to match the measured compartment data and then most importantly into the future with this model key questions about the site were addressed related to the migration of pfas over the past 40 years under the influence of advection dispersion sorption and matrix diffusion the model was then used to indicate how far the plume might migrate in future years and better understand the effectiveness of a hypothetical complete source removal project on controlling plume migration as such the following model simulations for pfos were used and focused on these key dates and subsequent remchlor md evaluations 1977 pfos from the source reached groundwater with a relatively constant source strength thereby creating the downgradient pfos plume 2017 high resolution site characterization was performed remchlor md analyses included 1 comparison of three different remchlor md models model a model b model c with three different representations of matrix diffusion to determine which model best fit the measured site data 2 application of one best fit model to evaluate chemical profiles with and without matrix diffusion 2020 hypothetical complete source removal project modeled in remchlor md 2040 plume length forecasted at about 20 years into future from present time with and without source removal in year 2020 2070 plume length forecasted at about 50 years into future from present time with and without source removal in year 2020 3 3 remchlor md input data site specific characteristics were used as inputs into the remchlor md models as seen in table 2 for geology site specific boring log data along the direction of groundwater flow locations 3 8 10 12 and 14 were used to quantify the number and thickness of low permeability layers within the plume and then entered into the heterogeneity calculator used in the remchlor md interface farhat et al 2018 for model a the remchlor md transmissive zone was defined to include only clean sands poorly graded sands sp as previously described two slug test results were available for a monitoring well located in the most transmissive geologic media sp with a geomean hydraulic conductivity of 2 4 10 3 cm s 6 8 ft day for this material an evaluation of soil borings indicated the sp sands were extensive enough to be continuous at the site therefore the low k geologic media in model a was defined as all fine grained geologic soil layers with a hydraulic conductivity 10 times lower than the geologic media in the remchlor md transmissive zone farhat et al 2022 a single slug test was performed at a well screened in sands with fines material sm and showed a hydraulic conductivity of 7 1 10 5 cm s 0 20 ft day or 34 times less than the more permeable sp sands therefore the sm soils were defined as being in the low k compartment the silt ml and low plasticity clay cl soils were also classified as low k units and had estimated hydraulic conductivities that were 235 times and 1821 times lower than the hydraulic conductivity of the sp soils to evaluate the sensitivity of the remchlor md model to the definition of what comprises low k media model b assumed that the silty sand soils sm and clean sand sp were transmissive and silt and clay ml and cl were low k units finally model c was constructed to simulate plume migration with no matrix diffusion to represent conventional analytical groundwater fate and transport models with no diffusion processes 3 4 calibration parameters and best match metrics the calibration effort focused on developing a remchlor md model that best matched three key metrics from the 2017 site investigation concentration of pfos at the furthest downgradient location location 14 note units of Œºg l per liter are used in the model interface this is a proxy for the measured plume length at the farthest downgradient monitoring well mass discharge kg yr at the source near transect and far transects total mass kg of pfos in the near downgradient and far downgradient plumes in both the low k and transmissive zones three model input parameters were used as calibration parameters the groundwater seepage velocity where the hydraulic conductivity and hydraulic gradient were fixed with the measured values from the site and seepage velocity was altered by changing the effective porosity longitudinal dispersivity m and the concentration in the source of the transmissive zone ug l these parameters were changed to find the best match to the three best fit metrics as a simplifying assumption no transformation of precursors to form pfos was assumed when the high resolution sampling was performed most of the precursor mass in 2017 was comprised of short chain precursors that could not form pfos adamson et al 2020 during the calibration effective porosity of the transmissive zone was initially maintained to an approximate range of 0 02 and 0 30 the lower range represents effective porosity as described in the remchlor md user s manual farhat et al 2018 when accounting for the reference to payne et al s 2008 mobile porosity for unconsolidated hydrogeologic settings that typically falls in the 0 02 to 0 10 range these lower effective porosities are being used more frequently in transport calculations and modeling studies for example the environmental consultant working at the site used an effective porosity of 0 05 for their transport calculations at this site consultant report 2017 prior to the work on this research for the upper range the remchlor md manual s upper range estimate of 0 30 for fine sand was used farhat et al 2018 initially longitudinal dispersivity was constrained to within the recommended range in the remchlor md manual farhat et al 2018 between 3 and 21 m transverse dispersivity was assumed to be 10 of the longitudinal dispersivity because the simulation assumed two dimensional groundwater flow vertical dispersity was not important to the model as recommended in farhat et al 2018 the model was run so the cell size in the x direction was always equal or less than two times the longitudinal dispersivity for each model because of the low concentrations that are modeled for pfos a convergence tolerance of 1 10 5 Œºg l was used in the model the initial source concentration calibration parameter reflects the pfos concentration in the source in 1977 the year the simulation started this concentration is assumed to be relatively constant through the life of the simulation because of the analysis previously described to simulate a relatively steady state source concentration the remchlor md gamma parameter was set to zero that when used in the power model results in an unchanging source mass discharge over time until the original source mass was exhausted in the model the mass discharge leaving the source is about 0 44 kg yr and therefore the 40 kg of pfos in the source in the model would be exhausted in about 91 years after the year the source started in 1977 or about the year 2068 4 results and discussion 4 1 comparison of three different model calibrations the results of the calibration exercise are shown in table 3 and fig 6 4 1 1 model a with clean sands as transmissive unit model a required very little adjustment of initial parameter estimates where the effective porosity was changed from 0 10 to 0 11 and the initial source concentration was increased from 1342 to 1600 Œºg l pfos in 1978 table 2 the final calibration results presented in table 3 shows the calibrated model was able to match measured pfos concentration at location 14 quite closely within 20 the root mean square error rmse between the pfos concentrations measured in the field and the simulated concentration was 200 ug2 l 2 the best of all three models similarly the rmse for the mass discharge 0 049 kg2 year 2 comparison was significantly better than model b and just slightly better than model c most importantly the model was able to reproduce the dominant feature of this site where significant mass is retained in low k units as expressed in the percent distribution of pfos mass in the low k transmissive media field data a total of 23 kg pfos downgradient of the source 80 in low k units comprised of sm ml and cl soils model a 18 6 kg pfos downgradient of the source 86 in low k units comprised of sm ml and cl soils for a low k mass percent ratio of 1 08 86 80 where 1 0 is a perfect match 4 1 2 model b both clean sands and silty sands as transmissive units an alternative conceptual model model b was used for a second remchlor md run where all sands both sp and sm were defined as transmissive media while low permeability media included only silts and clays ml and cl this alternative model assumes all the transmissive media have the same hydraulic properties so the hydraulic conductivity of the sp media was used to capture the high flow nature of this water bearing unit the model b rmse errors for both concentration and mass discharge were higher than model a when calibrated to the best extent possible effective porosity of 0 25 and longitudinal dispersivity of 3 m model b significantly overestimated the percent of mass in the low k compartment field data a total of 23 kg pfos downgradient of the source 21 in low k units comprised of only ml cl soils as a modified definition of low k units model b 31 kg pfos downgradient of the source 61 in low k units comprised of only ml cl soils for a low k mass percent ratio of 2 9 61 21 where 1 0 is a perfect match this evaluation of the alternate conceptual model where sm sands were lumped together with sp sands did not provide a good calibration to the percent mass in low k units metric and therefore supports the conceptual model model a where only sp clean sands comprise the transmissive compartment 4 1 3 model c no matrix diffusion an additional calibrated no matrix diffusion model was attempted an initial remchlor md model run resulted in a too long groundwater plume that significantly overpredicted concentrations at location 14 the most downgradient well here in order to shorten the plume and match the field data calibration parameters of effective porosity and longitudinal dispersivity were applied the model c rmse error for concentration 886 ug2 l 2 was significantly larger compared to model a and model b 200 and 300 ug2 l 2 respectively as seen in fig 6 the simulated concentration and mass discharge curves provide a good match to field data but only with an extreme value of effective porosity as a no matrix diffusion model the low k mass percent ratio was 0 0 i e adamson et al 2020 definitely shows significant pfas mass present in low k media but this conceptual model assumes there is none as such this model was not considered in future simulations overall the correlation of the three key evaluation metrics concentration mass discharge and total mass in the two units indicates that remchlor md model a with matrix diffusion in low permeability silty sands silts and clays was best able to simulate the observed pfos mass distribution from the high resolution monitoring program for plume migration to the northeast 4 2 key processes evaluated with the calibrated remchlor md model with matrix diffusion model a a hypothetical exercise to evaluate a possible maximum pfos plume extent was conducted where the edge of the plume was assumed to be at the 0 07 Œºg l 70 ppt preliminary remediation goal usepa 2019 with this definition of the pfos plume boundary the simulated plume was on the order of 350 m 1 150 ft long in 2017 this is generally supported by the field observations where relatively high concentrations of pfos were seen in the far downgradient location 1 67 Œºg l in location 14 about 270 m 890 ft from the center of the source however the entire pfos plume was not fully delineated in the field and therefore a comparison to the full extent of the plume could not be confirmed overall the base case remchlor md model was considered to adequately represent the key site characteristics that impact the fate and transport of pfos at the site and was then used to evaluate several key processes about pfos migration 4 2 1 impact of matrix diffusion on plume migration a second simulation of the calibrated model a was run without matrix diffusion processes i e no diffusion into low permeability layers by greatly reducing the diffusion coefficient by 4 orders of magnitude while all other variables were kept constant with this approach the geologic conceptual model is maintained where advection is dominated by the clean sands sp retained in both models and with no change in the calibrated groundwater seepage velocity but no matrix diffusion retention is possible for the no matrix diffusion model at this site model a suggested the plume length to the 0 07 Œºg l boundary was about 350 m in 2017 fig 7 with no matrix diffusion the simulated plume length was 910 m or 2 6 times longer than the with matrix diffusion case overall the application of the remchlor md model to this field site indicates that matrix diffusion can serve as an important attenuation process with respect to the rate of plume expansion for pfos a companion paper farhat et al 2022 explores this matrix diffusion attention process in more detail 4 2 2 potential future pfos plume expansion model a with matrix diffusion was then used to project the migration of the pfos plume in the future as a non degrading constituent with relatively strong source the remchlor md model runs forecasts that the pfos plume will likely continue to expand slowly to 420 m in the year 2040 and 500 m in the year 2070 fig 8 and table 4 these results suggest that due to the effects of dispersivity and potentially matrix diffusion the rate of plume expansion drops significantly over time as shown in table 4 from an average 8 8 m per year during the first 40 years of plume expansion to only 2 7 m per year during the period 63 to 93 years after the release additionally a hypothetical source remediation project was simulated in the year 2020 where 100 of the source mass was removed subsequent predictions of future plume migration indicated that this hypothetical source remediation would have no impact on the plume length in the year 2040 or 2070 a finding consistent with farhat et al 2022 modeling results for non degrading plumes source remediation has little effect on the plume expansion rate the distance of the leading edge of the plume from the source for the modeling scenarios shown in fig 8 some slight change was noticed in near source concentrations in 2040 and 2070 dashed lines but even these near source areas still have elevated concentrations of pfos after complete source remediation due to matrix diffusion 4 3 model limitations the remchlor md model and the input data have several limitations that increase the uncertainty in the model results while the observed hydrogeologic setting changes from the source to the downgradient portion of the plume fig 1 the remchlor md model assumes uniform values for groundwater hydraulic parameters and for the model s heterogeneity parameters in addition remchlor md only allows use of a linear isotherm throughout the model domain however while certain high concentration portions of the modeling domain may be better modeled by a freundlich isotherm the timing of the source term introducing pfas to the plume downgradient of the source is not likely to be much before 1968 but could be earlier or later than the best estimate of 1977 a different year for the birth of the plume could change some of the modeling results presented in the paper additionally the interpretations of the modeling results are based on the site characterization work done at the site to date additional site characterization could change the field data used in the calibration and provide new information about the potential plume length in addition modeling of other pfaas could result in different modeling outcomes finally the hydraulic conductivity data for the two types of sandy media fine sands and silty sands were fixed in the model but are only based on two slug tests which have a relatively large range of uncertainty overall the modeling results should not be considered definitive but rather indicate the general style of the key fate and transport processes for pfos at this site processes that include a significant impact from matrix diffusion 5 conclusions the work presented herein illustrates as with most contaminants storage and release of pfas in low permeability zones can be an important groundwater fate and transport process when the remchlor md model was applied to a well characterized pfas research site the pre calibration model input parameters had to be adjusted only slightly when matrix diffusion was used in the model the modeling work suggested that the definition of what comprises transmissive vs low k geologic media in the model is important when using remchlor md to model field sites four general soil types were logged during the site characterization project clean sands silty sands silts and clays for the purpose of modeling matrix diffusion in the model the clean sands k 2 4 10 3 cm s was always assumed to be transmissive geologic media and silts and clays were assumed to be low k media the fourth soil type silty sands k 7 1 10 5 cm s or 34 lower than the clean sands were modeled first as being low media model a then as transmissive media model b model a fit the site data much better in terms of match centerline plume concentrations mass discharge across three transects and the fraction of the pfos mass in defined low k media these results suggest that significant matrix diffusion can occur in plumes where there are two contacting sandy soil types and that low k media is not confined to only silts and clays at this site matrix diffusion processes appeared to have reduced the 1977 to 2017 plume length to only 350 m compared to a no matrix diffusion simulated plume length of 910 m this supports the conclusions of farhat et al 2022 that indicate that matrix diffusion is an important attenuation process for non degrading groundwater chemicals such as pfos with the calibrated remchlor md model future plume lengths were forecasted for the year 2070 93 years since the groundwater source started using a plume boundary criteria for pfos of 0 070 Œºg l and a u s environmental protection agency preliminary remediation goal the pfos plume is forecasted to grow from 350 m in 2017 to 500 m long in the year 2070 or 1 4 times longer than the 2017 plume length the modeling indicates that the plume expansion rate falls significantly over time from 8 8 m per year during the first 40 years of plume life to only 2 7 m per year during the interval from 63 to 93 years of plume life this is likely due to a combination of dispersion and matrix diffusion processes farhat et al 2022 because there are no receptors that will be contacted through the year 2070 about 50 years from now the modeling forecasts suggested this plume could be managed in place without the need of a pump and treat system to control migration however because of the uncertainty in the modeling results long term monitoring would likely be required for part or all of the next 50 years finally a hypothetical source remediation project in the year 2020 was forecasted to have no impact on the forecasted plume length in the year 2040 or 2070 a finding consistent with farhat et al 2022 modeling results overall this study highlights the importance of incorporating contaminant storage and release from low k zones into conceptual site models to quantify risks and select remedies for

1320,two of the most important retention processes for per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas in groundwater likely are sorption and matrix diffusion the objective of this study was to model concentration and mass discharge of one pfas perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos with matrix diffusion processes incorporated using data from a highly chemically and geologically characterized site when matrix diffusion is incorporated into the remchlor md model for pfos at this research site it easily reproduces the field data for three key metrics concentration mass discharge and total mass however the no matrix diffusion model produced a much poorer match additionally after about 40 years of groundwater transport field data and the remchlor md model both showed the majority 80 of the measured pfos mass that exited the source zones was located in downgradient low permeability zones due to matrix diffusion as such most of the pfos mass is not available to immediately migrate downgradient via advection in the more permeable sands at this site which has important implications for monitored natural attenuation mna plume expansion over the next 50 years is forecasted to be limited from a 350 m plume length in 2017 to 550 m in 2070 as matrix diffusion will attenuate groundwater plumes by slowing their expansion this phenomenon is important for constituents that do not degrade such as pfos compared to those susceptible to degradation overall this work shows that matrix diffusion is a relevant process in environmental pfas persistence and slows the rate of plume expansion over time keywords pfas pfos matrix diffusion fate and transport modeling remchlor md remediation 1 introduction pfas have recently appeared as a chemical of emerging concern in soil and groundwater several quantitative metrics indicate the potential scale of future cleanup of groundwater sites with pfas could be extensive newell et al 2020 specifically a symposium of 60 pfas experts concluded that due to their mobility persistence and technical limitations to remediation pfas present more complex challenges as compared to other chemicals simon et al 2019 while simon et al 2019 noted there are some uncertainties regarding pfas transport parameters conservatives assumptions can be used to evaluate different scenarios for pfas transport developing appropriate fate and transport modeling approaches for pfas is critical for evaluating risk at impacted sites as well as understanding what remedies or site management options are viable for addressing that risk without the ability to make planning level predictions about plume behavior over time it is difficult for decision makers to avoid expensive cleanup technologies such as groundwater pump and treat as a conservative measure it also limits the technical justification for selecting less intensive strategies for pfas such as monitored natural attenuation mna mna already faces a significant hurdle in that pfas are not expected to transform beyond perfluoroalkyl acids pfaas under natural environmental conditions however retention based processes can form the basis for applying monitored natural attenuation to manage pfas impacts in groundwater newell et al 2021a newell et al 2021b assuming an understanding of how these processes influence pfas plumes can be established two of the most important retention processes for pfas in groundwater are likely to be sorption and matrix diffusion the extent to which sorption contributes to retardation of pfas during groundwater transport is a function of aquifer properties but also the complex and diverse physical chemical properties of pfas as a chemical class higgins and luthy 2007 anderson et al 2019 adamson et al 2022 because they exhibit surfactant like properties pfas can partition to air water interfaces that are present within the pore space in the unsaturated zone pfas can sorb hydrophobically to naturally occurring organic matter on soils to non aqueous phase liquids napls and through electrostatic interactions with soil mineral phases because pfas are typically released to the environment as a mixture with various different charges some are anions some cations some zwitterions and hydrophobicity individual pfas can have a range of sorption characteristics for example long chained pfas will usually sorb more readily than short chained pfas and desorption hysteresis and competitive sorption among different pfas have the potential to impact pfas transport sima and jaff√© 2021 similarly cationic and zwitterionic pfas will tend to sorb more readily to soils than anionic pfas such as pfos and pfoa guelfo and higgins 2013 li et al 2018 given the negative surface charges associated with many soil particles e g clays the role of matrix diffusion in groundwater transport was first identified by foster 1975 in the chalk aquifer in southern and eastern england this term is used to describe the concentration gradient driven mechanism where chemicals are exchanged from media with high permeability to regions of lower permeability or low k as described in sale et al 2013 diffusion sudicky and frind 1982 and gillham et al 1984 initially showed how matrix diffusion can slow and attenuate solutes moving in heterogeneous geologic settings another key consequence of matrix diffusion is the chemical release from low k zones via back diffusion outward diffusion and slow advection once the concentrations in the transmissive zones drop either due to natural or engineered reduction in source strength or direct remediation of groundwater plumes chapman and parker 2005 nrc 2005 sale et al 2008 nrc 2013 sale et al 2013 usepa 2019 you et al 2020 brooks et al 2021 factors controlling the rate of diffusion to and from low k regions include diffusion and slow advection diffusion incorporates the difference in concentrations between the transmissive and low k media the amount of time chemicals are in contact with low k zones the diffusivity of the chemicals and the porosity tortuosity of the low k media sale et al 2013 modeling matrix diffusion can prove challenging because there are only limited number of commercially available analytical groundwater models that account for matrix diffusion e g chapman et al 2012 farhat et al 2012 muskus and falta 2018 falta et al 2018 and numerical models can result in erroneous results if the vertical discretization is too coarse chapman and parker 2005 farhat et al 2020 however failing to account for matrix diffusion in models leads to faulty predictions thus hindering effective remediation strategies adamson and newell 2014 oswer 2019 there has been extensive research on trying to model pfas transport in the vadose zone e g brusseau 2018 brusseau et al 2019 costanza et al 2019 silva et al 2020 guo et al 2020 however there are very few reports of groundwater modeling of pfas fate and transport in the saturated zone particularly those that evaluate plume behavior over time in a recent study by farhat et al 2022 the remchlor md model falta et al 2018 was applied to explore the general behavior of non degrading groundwater plumes like pfos and pfoa particularly with regard to retention based attenuation caused by matrix diffusion processes the resulting analysis concluded that non degrading plumes would continue to expand over time assuming a constant source but matrix diffusion will result in lower concentrations and smaller footprints for instance in a 100 year travel time scenario modeled with matrix diffusion the resulting pfos plume length was only 20 as long as a scenario without matrix diffusion farhat et al 2022 these results help highlight the potential relevance of matrix diffusion on pfas fate and transport which along with sorption and partial biotransformation could be expected to influence pfas retention within heterogeneous saturated zones this study presents a novel application of a matrix diffusion model remchlor md to simulate the history and potential future migration of an actual pfos plume at a well characterized research site here pfos transport was modeled using site specific data from a highly chemically and geologically characterized fire training area fta where significant pfas mass was encountered in low k soils nickerson et al 2020 adamson et al 2020 because the current state of knowledge suggests that pfos does not degrade in the environment the modeling focuses on non destructive attenuation processes such as sorption and matrix diffusion as such the objective of this study was to model concentration and mass discharge of pfas with matrix diffusion processes incorporated to show how these influence plume length and remedial performance this work establishes as with almost all contaminants that contaminant storage and release to and from low k zones matrix diffusion slow advection is also relevant in pfas source zones and plumes as with many contaminant releases failing to consider matrix diffusion has the potential to lead to flawed assessments of risk and or selection of remedies for pfas releases 2 site background the study area is a former firefighting training facility located within a military installation in the united states a high resolution site characterization program was conducted in 2017 consisting of 16 locations selected from within the source and downgradient areas here site characterization was conducted in the upper 10 15 m of a surficial aquifer using a hydraulic profiling tool hpt as well as collecting co located depth discrete soil and groundwater samples using a geoprobe drilling rig a detailed description of the field sample collection methods and analytical protocols are provided in nickerson et al 2020 a total of 58 groundwater samples were collected and analyzed for 79 pfas at oregon state university osu while 105 soil samples were collected and analyzed for 136 pfas at colorado school of mines csm adamson et al 2020 nickerson et al 2020 both the groundwater and soil data were used to quantify the following pfas groupings 1 pfos 2 pfoa 3 total pfaas 4 total cations and zwitterions 5 total precursors and 6 total pfas 2 1 hydrogeology based on results from subsurface drilling using a hydraulic profiling tool hpt and logging of cores collected during the field characterization there are four main soil types in the water bearing unit using the universal soil classification system usda 2012 these were 1 poorly graded sands sp 2 sands with fines sm 3 silt ml and 4 clays with low plasticity cl specifically the subsurface at this site is composed primarily of permeable sands and less permeable silts and clays adamson et al 2020 sands dominate the first 1 to 2 m of the site forming a thin vadose zone as a shallow aquifer is encountered within the first two meters of the subsurface laterally extensive clays appear at depths between 3 and 4 5 m with a second layer of silt clay present at around 10 m nickerson et al 2020 additionally based on site documents describing the hydrologic setting the aquifer consists of undifferentiated terrace and shallow marine deposits of pliocene to holocene age associated with glacial and inter glacial periods usgs 2000 fig 1 shows a cross section of the study site along the direction of groundwater flow depicting key soil types and stratigraphy groundwater flows in a north to northeast direction from the study area towards a river nickerson et al 2020 two slug test results were available for two monitoring wells screened in the most transmissive geologic media poorly graded sands sp as defined by the universal soil classification system farhat et al 2012 here slug test results together had geomean hydraulic conductivity of 2 4 10 3 cm s 6 8 ft day consultant report 2017 when combined with an estimated effective porosity of 0 10 and the measured hydraulic gradient of 0 00375 m m the estimated seepage velocity for the most transmissive sands was 28 m year 93 ft year the effective porosity is a key parameter for the transport model applied at this site the environmental consulting company that performed the slug tests used an effective porosity of 0 05 for their seepage velocity calculations citing while silty sand may have an average porosity of between 25 and 60 percent the effective porosity is usually estimated at about 5 percent consultant report 2017 these effective porosities while lower than some groundwater modeling studies are supported by the mobile porosity model developed by payne et al 2008 that was based on approximately 15 detailed tracer tests at remediation sites similarly kulkarni et al 2020 evaluated 141 boring logs from 43 sites to develop an empirical estimate of a representative mobile porosity resulting in a value of approximately 0 11 additionally three spatial compartments were used to define the pfas plume source transect near downgradient transect and far downgradient transect figs 2 and 3 depict the relative distribution of the different soil types in the three spatial compartments 2 2 pfas source and plume characteristics between 1968 and 1991 site personnel used aqueous film forming foam afff while training to extinguish fires in a pit measuring approximately 36 m in diameter adamson et al 2020 nickerson et al 2020 given the known presence of pfas in afff a site characterization was carried out starting in 2017 in an effort to determine the spatial distribution of pfas in the shallow aquifer adamson et al 2020 nickerson et al 2020 while afff was only released within the training pit impacts to adjacent areas is possible due to overspray adamson et al 2020 nickerson et al 2020 soils from the study area have previously been the focus of a 1994 remediation project for non pfas chemicals where petroleum impacted soils were removed from the pit and remediated at a mobile low thermal desorption treatment unit adamson et al 2020 nickerson et al 2020 following treatment the soils were returned to the pit based on depth discrete groundwater sampling fig 4 depicts the pfos groundwater plume at the site fig 5 uses depth discrete soil sampling data to show a three dimensional depiction of pfos mass in subsurface soil 3 methods 3 1 pfas mass and mass discharge estimation process adamson et al 2020 employed the voxler interpolation tool version 4 6 913 golden software 2019 to develop a three dimensional grid of the pfas data and soil types as described by adamson et al 2020 a total of 58 groundwater samples were analyzed for 79 pfas compounds by dr jennifer fields lab at oregon state university osu these data were kriged using gms and then used by the voxler tool to develop a three dimensional model of soil concentrations for key pfas and pfas classes and for soil type the voxler tool was then able to calculate masses of these categories in different regions of the site e g source near downgradient far downgradient and in different soil types a total of 105 soil samples were analyzed for 136 pfas compounds by dr chris higgins lab at the colorado school of mines csm the voxler model was used to construct a three dimensional model of concentrations for key pfas and pfas categories which was then used to calculate mass discharge across the three transects adamson et al 2020 a visualization of the pfos subsurface mass generated by the voxler model is shown in fig 5 additionally the pfas compartment model provided a quantitative dataset showing where pfas were distributed in the subsurface in 2017 including how much was in the source vs plume in the transmissive vs low k geologic media and in the aqueous phase vs sorbed phase see figs 1 2 and 3 respectively in adamson et al 2020 here the source was defined by knowledge of historic site activities and their spatial footprint as well as site characterization data confirming significantly higher concentrations additionally the mass discharge data showed the rate that pfas are transported through the transmissive zone at three different vertical transects of the source plume system to establish the physio chemical natural attenuation of pfas at this site for the current modeling study pfos was selected as the pfas of interest because it was the most prevalent pfas representing 40 kg of the total 222 kg of total pfas at the site adamson et al 2020 key pfos mass in various soil types from the voxler tool are shown in table 1 the tool also yielded three pfos mass discharge values for the three transects shown in fig 2 source transect 0 m from source 0 31 kg yr 87 through sp soils near downgradient 114 m from source 0 13 kg yr 98 through sp soils far downgradient 190 m from source 0 0053 kg yr 85 through sp soils for estimating the source mass discharge history that was applicable at this site several commonly used options that involve simple functions over time were initially considered e g newell and adamson 2005 constant source over time until the source mass is depleted step function linearly decaying source until the source mass is depleted and exponentially decaying source based on the source mass a more sophisticated source model that was also considered was the power function model sometimes referred to as the gamma model where the change in source strength over time is a function of the change of source mass over time to a defined power gamma rao et al 2001 falta et al 2005 assigning a value of zero for gamma gives a step function for the source strength 0 5 gives a linear decline in source strength and a gamma of 1 0 gives an exponential decay other values give a hybrid between these different models with values greater than 1 0 giving long slowly changing extended source strength tails to determine which of these simple models was best suited for modeling the pfos source strength over time at this research site an initial exploratory evaluation of the 2017 mass and mass discharge data was performed the best available site records indicated that fire fighting training activities at the site with afff started in approximately 1968 although the records are not definitive in general pfas containing fire fighting foams for the u s military were introduced in the late 1960s 3m 2021 so much earlier dates of release to groundwater are unlikely later releases to groundwater are possible particularly considering the time it takes for pfas from the vadose zone source to migrate to groundwater e g guo et al 2020 by the year 2017 49 years later the mass of total pfas in the downgradient plume was measured to be 117 kg and the mass discharge from the source upgradient side gradient zones was estimated to be 3 6 kg yr adamson et al 2020 while these are not precise estimates due to uncertainties in the historical record and in the mass and mass discharge calculations they can form the basis for developing a hypothesis regarding the source strength history for example a constant mass discharge of 3 6 kg yr of pfas over 49 years 1968 to 2017 would have delivered 176 kg of pfas to the downgradient plume about 1 5 times the measured mass a higher source in 1968 that declines to 3 6 kg yr in 2017 would have introduced even more pfas mass to the downgradient plume increasing the discrepancy between modeled and measured pfas mass this information suggested the best model for fitting these data was a constant source step function however even the constant source model overpredicted the measured downgradient plume pfas mass in 2017 therefore the initiation of pfas mass discharge to the downgradient plume was hypothesized to start nine years after 1968 in 1977 to yield a calculated downgradient mass of 144 kg 3 6 kg yr x 40 years compared to the measured mass of 120 kg it is possible that fire fighting training was started at a low level in 1968 but then increased significantly in the late 1970s the better match with the 40 year time may also be caused by the slow vertical migration of the pfas through the vadose zone where it might have partitioned to the air water interfaces and then via slow downward radial flow to groundwater no degradation of total pfas was assumed because any transformation of pfas precursors would have been matched by a similar mass of pfaa s generated from the transformation the matches for individual pfas varied the constant source model overestimated pfos mass in the downgradient plume by 44 but underestimated pfoa by about 50 the match between constant source model and the measured field data were relatively close for pfaas and total precursors data not shown because of this variability between different pfas and pfas classes the timing analysis based on the total pfas mass discharge and measured downgradient total pfas mass was used for the modeling analysis overall this comparison concludes that unlike the mass discharge patterns typically observed at chlorinated solvent or benzene toluene ethylbenzene xylene btex sites e g see newell et al 2014 this pfas site may have had a relatively constant mass discharge from the source for the past 40 years because pfos was the key focus of this modeling research an additional evaluation was performed to increase the confidence in these field based mass estimates an independent analysis of the potential amount of pfos that could have been introduced into the subsurface was performed based on historical use data at firefighting training sites as described in adamson et al 2020 supplemental information this historical usage estimate indicated it was possible that about 81 kg of pfos could have been released during fire fighting training events during the lifetime of the site the 81 kg is within a factor of two compared to the more reliable measured pfos mass of 40 kg a relatively close match considering the uncertainties in the historic usage estimate additional uncertainties include the transformation of precursors to pfos historically or ongoing as no precursors or biotic transformation to pfos has been accounted for in mass estimates in the source or downgradient because rate data are relatively limited adamson et al 2020 in addition the site data presented in adamson et al 2020 showed that precursors were primarily located in the source area such that transformation to pfos within the plume would be minimal 3 2 remchlor md model overview these data were used to evaluate a novel application of a recently released estcp groundwater fate and transport model remchlor md falta et al 2018 farhat et al 2018 for the pfos plume at the site while designed for chlorinated solvent sites remchlor md can be adapted to simulate groundwater transport at pfas sites remchlor md consists of a simple source model coupled to a semi analytical plume transport model the source model uses a power law relationship to define the long term relationship between the remaining source mass and the mass discharge leaving the source at any time the plume model uses a semi analytical method with defined gridblocks to simulate advection dispersion retardation and degradation in addition the plume model can simulate matrix diffusion effects for two different geologic configurations 1 low k aquitards in contact with transmissive geologic media and 2 the effect of low k layers and lenses embedded within the transmissive media the embedded matrix diffusion term was derived by falta and wang 2017 and muskus and falta 2018 by adapting heat conduction models developed by vinsome and westerveld 1980 to use this feature in the model users enter transmissive vs low k layering information contained in existing geologic boring logs into the model s heterogeneity calculator which then calculates three key matrix diffusion variables used by the model 1 the volume fraction of low permeability material 2 the characteristic maximum matrix diffusion length and 3 the surface area of the transmissive low k interfaces within each defined gridblock with the high resolution field data reliable estimates of the mass of different pfas and pfas groups were used to bound how much pfas was released at the afff fire training facility and the original mass discharge to groundwater in 1968 with these values the evolution attenuation of a pfas source and plume considering matrix diffusion was reconstructed potentially for the first time the remchlor md model uses a linear isotherm to describe sorption of the chemicals in both the transmissive and low k zones of the model and cannot use any other type of isotherm pfas sorption is the focus of considerable research and a variety of isotherms have been used to represent sorption such as freundlich langmuir virial and linear isotherms sima and jaff√© 2021 evaluated the appropriateness of various isotherm types and stated that at low pfas concentrations a linear kd may be sufficient depending on soil pfas solvent interaction citing four studies milinovic et al 2015 miao et al 2017 wei et al 2017 li et al 2019 as support for this statement it should be noted that each of these four studies cited in sima and jaff√© 2021 had different conclusions about which models fit their experiment data better and had different upper concentration thresholds for use of a linear isotherm more importantly the four papers did not suggest a single freundlich model with a specific freundlich n value that would be appropriate for modeling a particular site therefore for the remchlor md model the use of the linear isotherm was considered an appropriate approach for this early attempt to modeling pfas in groundwater using the remchlor md model the change in the pfas compartment model was simulated starting from the source reaching groundwater around 1978 to the near present 2017 where the model can be adjusted to match the measured compartment data and then most importantly into the future with this model key questions about the site were addressed related to the migration of pfas over the past 40 years under the influence of advection dispersion sorption and matrix diffusion the model was then used to indicate how far the plume might migrate in future years and better understand the effectiveness of a hypothetical complete source removal project on controlling plume migration as such the following model simulations for pfos were used and focused on these key dates and subsequent remchlor md evaluations 1977 pfos from the source reached groundwater with a relatively constant source strength thereby creating the downgradient pfos plume 2017 high resolution site characterization was performed remchlor md analyses included 1 comparison of three different remchlor md models model a model b model c with three different representations of matrix diffusion to determine which model best fit the measured site data 2 application of one best fit model to evaluate chemical profiles with and without matrix diffusion 2020 hypothetical complete source removal project modeled in remchlor md 2040 plume length forecasted at about 20 years into future from present time with and without source removal in year 2020 2070 plume length forecasted at about 50 years into future from present time with and without source removal in year 2020 3 3 remchlor md input data site specific characteristics were used as inputs into the remchlor md models as seen in table 2 for geology site specific boring log data along the direction of groundwater flow locations 3 8 10 12 and 14 were used to quantify the number and thickness of low permeability layers within the plume and then entered into the heterogeneity calculator used in the remchlor md interface farhat et al 2018 for model a the remchlor md transmissive zone was defined to include only clean sands poorly graded sands sp as previously described two slug test results were available for a monitoring well located in the most transmissive geologic media sp with a geomean hydraulic conductivity of 2 4 10 3 cm s 6 8 ft day for this material an evaluation of soil borings indicated the sp sands were extensive enough to be continuous at the site therefore the low k geologic media in model a was defined as all fine grained geologic soil layers with a hydraulic conductivity 10 times lower than the geologic media in the remchlor md transmissive zone farhat et al 2022 a single slug test was performed at a well screened in sands with fines material sm and showed a hydraulic conductivity of 7 1 10 5 cm s 0 20 ft day or 34 times less than the more permeable sp sands therefore the sm soils were defined as being in the low k compartment the silt ml and low plasticity clay cl soils were also classified as low k units and had estimated hydraulic conductivities that were 235 times and 1821 times lower than the hydraulic conductivity of the sp soils to evaluate the sensitivity of the remchlor md model to the definition of what comprises low k media model b assumed that the silty sand soils sm and clean sand sp were transmissive and silt and clay ml and cl were low k units finally model c was constructed to simulate plume migration with no matrix diffusion to represent conventional analytical groundwater fate and transport models with no diffusion processes 3 4 calibration parameters and best match metrics the calibration effort focused on developing a remchlor md model that best matched three key metrics from the 2017 site investigation concentration of pfos at the furthest downgradient location location 14 note units of Œºg l per liter are used in the model interface this is a proxy for the measured plume length at the farthest downgradient monitoring well mass discharge kg yr at the source near transect and far transects total mass kg of pfos in the near downgradient and far downgradient plumes in both the low k and transmissive zones three model input parameters were used as calibration parameters the groundwater seepage velocity where the hydraulic conductivity and hydraulic gradient were fixed with the measured values from the site and seepage velocity was altered by changing the effective porosity longitudinal dispersivity m and the concentration in the source of the transmissive zone ug l these parameters were changed to find the best match to the three best fit metrics as a simplifying assumption no transformation of precursors to form pfos was assumed when the high resolution sampling was performed most of the precursor mass in 2017 was comprised of short chain precursors that could not form pfos adamson et al 2020 during the calibration effective porosity of the transmissive zone was initially maintained to an approximate range of 0 02 and 0 30 the lower range represents effective porosity as described in the remchlor md user s manual farhat et al 2018 when accounting for the reference to payne et al s 2008 mobile porosity for unconsolidated hydrogeologic settings that typically falls in the 0 02 to 0 10 range these lower effective porosities are being used more frequently in transport calculations and modeling studies for example the environmental consultant working at the site used an effective porosity of 0 05 for their transport calculations at this site consultant report 2017 prior to the work on this research for the upper range the remchlor md manual s upper range estimate of 0 30 for fine sand was used farhat et al 2018 initially longitudinal dispersivity was constrained to within the recommended range in the remchlor md manual farhat et al 2018 between 3 and 21 m transverse dispersivity was assumed to be 10 of the longitudinal dispersivity because the simulation assumed two dimensional groundwater flow vertical dispersity was not important to the model as recommended in farhat et al 2018 the model was run so the cell size in the x direction was always equal or less than two times the longitudinal dispersivity for each model because of the low concentrations that are modeled for pfos a convergence tolerance of 1 10 5 Œºg l was used in the model the initial source concentration calibration parameter reflects the pfos concentration in the source in 1977 the year the simulation started this concentration is assumed to be relatively constant through the life of the simulation because of the analysis previously described to simulate a relatively steady state source concentration the remchlor md gamma parameter was set to zero that when used in the power model results in an unchanging source mass discharge over time until the original source mass was exhausted in the model the mass discharge leaving the source is about 0 44 kg yr and therefore the 40 kg of pfos in the source in the model would be exhausted in about 91 years after the year the source started in 1977 or about the year 2068 4 results and discussion 4 1 comparison of three different model calibrations the results of the calibration exercise are shown in table 3 and fig 6 4 1 1 model a with clean sands as transmissive unit model a required very little adjustment of initial parameter estimates where the effective porosity was changed from 0 10 to 0 11 and the initial source concentration was increased from 1342 to 1600 Œºg l pfos in 1978 table 2 the final calibration results presented in table 3 shows the calibrated model was able to match measured pfos concentration at location 14 quite closely within 20 the root mean square error rmse between the pfos concentrations measured in the field and the simulated concentration was 200 ug2 l 2 the best of all three models similarly the rmse for the mass discharge 0 049 kg2 year 2 comparison was significantly better than model b and just slightly better than model c most importantly the model was able to reproduce the dominant feature of this site where significant mass is retained in low k units as expressed in the percent distribution of pfos mass in the low k transmissive media field data a total of 23 kg pfos downgradient of the source 80 in low k units comprised of sm ml and cl soils model a 18 6 kg pfos downgradient of the source 86 in low k units comprised of sm ml and cl soils for a low k mass percent ratio of 1 08 86 80 where 1 0 is a perfect match 4 1 2 model b both clean sands and silty sands as transmissive units an alternative conceptual model model b was used for a second remchlor md run where all sands both sp and sm were defined as transmissive media while low permeability media included only silts and clays ml and cl this alternative model assumes all the transmissive media have the same hydraulic properties so the hydraulic conductivity of the sp media was used to capture the high flow nature of this water bearing unit the model b rmse errors for both concentration and mass discharge were higher than model a when calibrated to the best extent possible effective porosity of 0 25 and longitudinal dispersivity of 3 m model b significantly overestimated the percent of mass in the low k compartment field data a total of 23 kg pfos downgradient of the source 21 in low k units comprised of only ml cl soils as a modified definition of low k units model b 31 kg pfos downgradient of the source 61 in low k units comprised of only ml cl soils for a low k mass percent ratio of 2 9 61 21 where 1 0 is a perfect match this evaluation of the alternate conceptual model where sm sands were lumped together with sp sands did not provide a good calibration to the percent mass in low k units metric and therefore supports the conceptual model model a where only sp clean sands comprise the transmissive compartment 4 1 3 model c no matrix diffusion an additional calibrated no matrix diffusion model was attempted an initial remchlor md model run resulted in a too long groundwater plume that significantly overpredicted concentrations at location 14 the most downgradient well here in order to shorten the plume and match the field data calibration parameters of effective porosity and longitudinal dispersivity were applied the model c rmse error for concentration 886 ug2 l 2 was significantly larger compared to model a and model b 200 and 300 ug2 l 2 respectively as seen in fig 6 the simulated concentration and mass discharge curves provide a good match to field data but only with an extreme value of effective porosity as a no matrix diffusion model the low k mass percent ratio was 0 0 i e adamson et al 2020 definitely shows significant pfas mass present in low k media but this conceptual model assumes there is none as such this model was not considered in future simulations overall the correlation of the three key evaluation metrics concentration mass discharge and total mass in the two units indicates that remchlor md model a with matrix diffusion in low permeability silty sands silts and clays was best able to simulate the observed pfos mass distribution from the high resolution monitoring program for plume migration to the northeast 4 2 key processes evaluated with the calibrated remchlor md model with matrix diffusion model a a hypothetical exercise to evaluate a possible maximum pfos plume extent was conducted where the edge of the plume was assumed to be at the 0 07 Œºg l 70 ppt preliminary remediation goal usepa 2019 with this definition of the pfos plume boundary the simulated plume was on the order of 350 m 1 150 ft long in 2017 this is generally supported by the field observations where relatively high concentrations of pfos were seen in the far downgradient location 1 67 Œºg l in location 14 about 270 m 890 ft from the center of the source however the entire pfos plume was not fully delineated in the field and therefore a comparison to the full extent of the plume could not be confirmed overall the base case remchlor md model was considered to adequately represent the key site characteristics that impact the fate and transport of pfos at the site and was then used to evaluate several key processes about pfos migration 4 2 1 impact of matrix diffusion on plume migration a second simulation of the calibrated model a was run without matrix diffusion processes i e no diffusion into low permeability layers by greatly reducing the diffusion coefficient by 4 orders of magnitude while all other variables were kept constant with this approach the geologic conceptual model is maintained where advection is dominated by the clean sands sp retained in both models and with no change in the calibrated groundwater seepage velocity but no matrix diffusion retention is possible for the no matrix diffusion model at this site model a suggested the plume length to the 0 07 Œºg l boundary was about 350 m in 2017 fig 7 with no matrix diffusion the simulated plume length was 910 m or 2 6 times longer than the with matrix diffusion case overall the application of the remchlor md model to this field site indicates that matrix diffusion can serve as an important attenuation process with respect to the rate of plume expansion for pfos a companion paper farhat et al 2022 explores this matrix diffusion attention process in more detail 4 2 2 potential future pfos plume expansion model a with matrix diffusion was then used to project the migration of the pfos plume in the future as a non degrading constituent with relatively strong source the remchlor md model runs forecasts that the pfos plume will likely continue to expand slowly to 420 m in the year 2040 and 500 m in the year 2070 fig 8 and table 4 these results suggest that due to the effects of dispersivity and potentially matrix diffusion the rate of plume expansion drops significantly over time as shown in table 4 from an average 8 8 m per year during the first 40 years of plume expansion to only 2 7 m per year during the period 63 to 93 years after the release additionally a hypothetical source remediation project was simulated in the year 2020 where 100 of the source mass was removed subsequent predictions of future plume migration indicated that this hypothetical source remediation would have no impact on the plume length in the year 2040 or 2070 a finding consistent with farhat et al 2022 modeling results for non degrading plumes source remediation has little effect on the plume expansion rate the distance of the leading edge of the plume from the source for the modeling scenarios shown in fig 8 some slight change was noticed in near source concentrations in 2040 and 2070 dashed lines but even these near source areas still have elevated concentrations of pfos after complete source remediation due to matrix diffusion 4 3 model limitations the remchlor md model and the input data have several limitations that increase the uncertainty in the model results while the observed hydrogeologic setting changes from the source to the downgradient portion of the plume fig 1 the remchlor md model assumes uniform values for groundwater hydraulic parameters and for the model s heterogeneity parameters in addition remchlor md only allows use of a linear isotherm throughout the model domain however while certain high concentration portions of the modeling domain may be better modeled by a freundlich isotherm the timing of the source term introducing pfas to the plume downgradient of the source is not likely to be much before 1968 but could be earlier or later than the best estimate of 1977 a different year for the birth of the plume could change some of the modeling results presented in the paper additionally the interpretations of the modeling results are based on the site characterization work done at the site to date additional site characterization could change the field data used in the calibration and provide new information about the potential plume length in addition modeling of other pfaas could result in different modeling outcomes finally the hydraulic conductivity data for the two types of sandy media fine sands and silty sands were fixed in the model but are only based on two slug tests which have a relatively large range of uncertainty overall the modeling results should not be considered definitive but rather indicate the general style of the key fate and transport processes for pfos at this site processes that include a significant impact from matrix diffusion 5 conclusions the work presented herein illustrates as with most contaminants storage and release of pfas in low permeability zones can be an important groundwater fate and transport process when the remchlor md model was applied to a well characterized pfas research site the pre calibration model input parameters had to be adjusted only slightly when matrix diffusion was used in the model the modeling work suggested that the definition of what comprises transmissive vs low k geologic media in the model is important when using remchlor md to model field sites four general soil types were logged during the site characterization project clean sands silty sands silts and clays for the purpose of modeling matrix diffusion in the model the clean sands k 2 4 10 3 cm s was always assumed to be transmissive geologic media and silts and clays were assumed to be low k media the fourth soil type silty sands k 7 1 10 5 cm s or 34 lower than the clean sands were modeled first as being low media model a then as transmissive media model b model a fit the site data much better in terms of match centerline plume concentrations mass discharge across three transects and the fraction of the pfos mass in defined low k media these results suggest that significant matrix diffusion can occur in plumes where there are two contacting sandy soil types and that low k media is not confined to only silts and clays at this site matrix diffusion processes appeared to have reduced the 1977 to 2017 plume length to only 350 m compared to a no matrix diffusion simulated plume length of 910 m this supports the conclusions of farhat et al 2022 that indicate that matrix diffusion is an important attenuation process for non degrading groundwater chemicals such as pfos with the calibrated remchlor md model future plume lengths were forecasted for the year 2070 93 years since the groundwater source started using a plume boundary criteria for pfos of 0 070 Œºg l and a u s environmental protection agency preliminary remediation goal the pfos plume is forecasted to grow from 350 m in 2017 to 500 m long in the year 2070 or 1 4 times longer than the 2017 plume length the modeling indicates that the plume expansion rate falls significantly over time from 8 8 m per year during the first 40 years of plume life to only 2 7 m per year during the interval from 63 to 93 years of plume life this is likely due to a combination of dispersion and matrix diffusion processes farhat et al 2022 because there are no receptors that will be contacted through the year 2070 about 50 years from now the modeling forecasts suggested this plume could be managed in place without the need of a pump and treat system to control migration however because of the uncertainty in the modeling results long term monitoring would likely be required for part or all of the next 50 years finally a hypothetical source remediation project in the year 2020 was forecasted to have no impact on the forecasted plume length in the year 2040 or 2070 a finding consistent with farhat et al 2022 modeling results overall this study highlights the importance of incorporating contaminant storage and release from low k zones into conceptual site models to quantify risks and select remedies for

1321,when performing calculations or numerical simulations for the fate and transport of pfas and other surface active solutes in the vadose zone accurately representing the relationship between the area of the air water interfaces a aw as a function of water saturation s w and changes in that relationship resulting from changes in soil texture are equally important as accurately characterizing interfacial adsorption coefficients and the concentration dependence for pfas solutes this is true because the magnitude of the a aw directly governs the degree of air water interfacial adsorption which contributes to the transport retardation of these solutes within unsaturated porous media herein a well known thermodynamic based model for predicting the a aw s w relationship is evaluated through comparisons to literature data collected using various measurement techniques for model sands and a limited number of soils using data collected from the current published literature this predictive model herein termed the leverett thermodynamic model ltm relies on the characterization of the soil water retention curve swrc for a given soil using the van genuchten vg equation for the pressure head vs s w relationship therefore methods to estimate the vg equation parameters are also compared as to the a aw s w relationships predicted comparisons suggest that the ltm provides the best estimate of the actual a aw s w relationships for water containing non surface active solutes because pfas solutes are also surface active a aw measurement methods utilizing surface active tracers are considered to provide the most accurate representation of the a aw s w relationship for these solutes differences between a aw s w relationships derived from tracer methods and the ltm are described in relation to media surface roughness effects based on the available literature data a practical empirical model is proposed to adjust the ltm prediction to account for the effects of surface roughness on the magnitude of the a aw for surface active solutes finally example retention calculations are performed to demonstrate the sensitivity of the predicted a aw s w relationship on the vadose zone transport of of a representative pfas perfluorooctane sulfonate keywords pfas air water interfacial adsorption air water interfacial area vadose zone transport soil texture and surface roughness effects modeling 1 introduction per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas are a class of emerging contaminants that have received significant attention in recent years due to human health concerns their widespread use and distribution in the environment and their general resistance to degradation in the environment pfas groundwater contamination is often associated with the leaching of these compounds from commercial products initially deposited in unlined landfills or on the ground surface e g from land applied bio solids and past releases of aqueous film forming foam afff products at fire training areas in these release scenarios pfas must first transport through the vadose zone prior to reaching underlying aquifers pfas has been shown to accumulate within the shallow vadose zone serving as a long term source of groundwater contamination shin et al 2011 xiao et al 2015 weber et al 2017 anderson et al 2006 anderson et al 2019 therefore it is important to understand and characterize pfas fate and transport mechanisms within the vadose zone to better assist environmental risk assessment and future remediation decision making pfas are surface active chemicals i e surfactants as surfactants pfas will accumulate at fluid interfaces during transport through the vadose zone of particular interest in this paper is the adsorption of pfas at air water interfaces awi although other important interfacial processes have been identified as additional contributors to overall pfas retention e g guelfo and higgins 2013 mckenzie et al 2016 brusseau 2018 pfas adsorption at awis is significant under certain conditions e g brusseau 2018 silva et al 2019 guo et al 2020 silva et al 2020 depending on the specific surface activity of a given pfas and the magnitude of the area of the awi a aw a aw is inversely related to volumetric water content Œ∏ w or water saturation s w Œ∏ w porosity variability in aaw depends on the particle size distribution in water content which in turn depends on textural properties of the vadose zone soil each of these dependencies can vary spatially and temporally within the vadose zone environment complicating transport calculations methods to characterize the a aw s w relationship have included theoretical models based on empirical relationships or assumptions of pore geometry e g leverett 1941 bradford and leij 1997 gvirtzman and roberts 1991 or and tuller 1999 oostrom et al 2001 jiang et al 2019 and experimental measurement methods utilizing surface active gas phase and aqueous phase chemical tracers e g kakare and fort 1996 kim et al 1997 silva 1997 kim et al 1999 schaefer et al 2000 costanza robinson 2001 silva et al 2002 araujo et al 2015 brusseau et al 2020 more recently direct imaging via x ray microtomography xmt methods have additionally been employed e g brusseau et al 2007 costanza robinson et al 2008 araujo and brusseau 2020 the various methods used for a aw measurement methods have been shown to provide different a aw values for a given s w value as well as different a aw s w relationships particularly at lower moisture conditions for example xmt methods provide linear a aw s w relationships throughout the entire range of s w gas phase tracer methods i e those in which a gaseous or vaporous tracer is introduced to a mobile air phase and where the aqueous phase and a aw are assumed static typically provide highly non linear a aw s w relationships and a aw values are considerably greater than those provided by other measurement methods with respect to aqueous tracer methods there are two main types the first type involves introducing the interfacial tracer with aqueous advection wherein the tracer contacts the available interfacial area under steady unsaturated flow e g brusseau et al 2015 and references therein for the second method the tracer solution is introduced to an unsaturated sand column and the a aw is estimated via a mass balance calculation from the equilibrium mass of tracer lost from the test column when allowed to drain to a steady state moisture condition schaefer et al 2000 araujo et al 2015 schaefer et al 2000 observed linear a aw s w relationships while araujo et al 2015 using similar methods observed a non linear increasing trend in a aw with increasing s w both gaseous and aqueous tracer methods provide a aw values that are greater than those derived from xmt measurements at the same s w condition and the differences increase with decreasing s w the differences in a aw values provided by the different measurement methods has been argued to result from each method characterizing different fractions of the total a aw e g a aw associated with capillary held pendular water and a aw associated with thin water films adsorbed to mineral surfaces e g costanza robinson 2001 brusseau et al 2006 the variability in a aw s w relationships presented in the literature can lead to confusion over which relationships are most appropriate when performing fate and transport calculations for pfas or other surface active solutes the most commonly held view based on the collective literature to date is to use a aw s w relationships that best represent the transport conditions being investigated for pfas of current environmental concern transport within the vadose zone occurs in the aqueous phase and a aw s w relationships derived from aqueous based methods would therefore be most representative silva et al 2020 guo et al 2020 brusseau et al 2020 brusseau et al 2019 as these methods are considered to characterize a aw accessible to surface active solutes present in the aqueous phase however discrepancies between these methods remain and too little data representative of a variety of soil types are available to make a clear judgment on the utility of the a aw s w relationships provided likewise the diversity of theoretical models available in the literature to predict the a aw s w relationship for a given porous media adds to the complexity and uncertainty herein the efficacy of one of several theoretical models to predict a aw s w relationships a modification of the thermodynamic based model first conceptualized by leverett 1941 hereafter referred to as the leverett thermodynamic model ltm is evaluated data used in this evaluation represents a variety of model porous media and natural sandy soils with the goal of improving the accuracy of transport calculations for pfas and other similarly surface active solutes this theoretical model has been used to simulate colloid and bacteria transport ≈°im≈Ønek et al 2016 and was recently implemented in an additional modified version of the hydrus unsaturated flow and transport model to simulate pfas transport in the vadose zone silva et al 2020 predicted results are compared to a aw s w relationships derived from the literature that utilized xmt and aqueous tracer based measurements a aw s w relationships predicted by the ltm method are directly dependent on the characteristics of the soil water retention curve swrc for a given porous media here the well known van genuchten vg equation was selected to model swrcs therefore evaluation and discussion of the impact of key vg equation parameters on predicted a aw s w relationships are additionally provided finally an empirical relationship is proposed that can be used to scale the ltm to be more representative of a aw values measured by surface active solutes thereby improving estimates of pfas retention within the vadose zone due to awi adsorption 2 materials and methods 2 1 awi area calculation the method used here to estimate a aw as it changes with soil water content Œ∏ was proposed by leverett 1941 and implemented by bradford et al 2015 as 1a a aw Œ∏ 1 Œ≥ o Œ∏ Œ∏ s p c Œ∏ dŒ∏ œÅ w g Œ≥ o Œ∏ Œ∏ s h Œ∏ dŒ∏ 1b d a aw Œ∏ d Œ∏ p c Œ≥ o œÅ w gh Œ≥ o where Œ∏ s is the saturated water content l3 l3 p c is the capillary pressure m lt2 h is the pressure head l Œ≥ 0 is the air water surface tension m t2 œÅ w is the density of water m l3 and g is the gravitational acceleration l t2 the integration provides a aw in units of l2 l3 or l 1 where the l3 term in the numerator is the total volume of air water and solid phases the magnitude of a aw increases with decreasing Œ∏ and approaches the geometric surface area gsa of the porous media as Œ∏ approaches the residual irreducible water content Œ∏ r this approach relies on a specific model characterizing the change in water content in response to a change in h here we selected the well known van genuchten vg model van genuchten 1980 2 Œ∏ h Œ∏ r Œ∏ s Œ∏ r 1 Œ±h n 1 1 n h 0 Œ∏ s h 0 where Œ∏ r has units of l3 l3 Œ± 1 l is a parameter related to the inverse of the air entry pressure head for the porous medium and n is a parameter related to the pore size distribution eq 1 describes the soil water retention curve swrc for a porous medium the use of eq 1 and similar methods to estimating a aw s w relationships have been previously referred to as the thermodynamic approach e g dalla et al 2002 grant and gerhard 2007 schroth et al 2008 because as proposed by leverett 1941 it relates changes in a aw to the thermodynamic work done within a unit volume of unsaturated porous media when changes in water contents occur due to changes in capillary pressure the integration of eq 1 i e the area under the swrc yields the a aw s w relationship the endpoint of the a aw prediction is the Œ∏ r for a given porous medium where it is assumed that soil moisture exists as pendular water and as a thin adsorbed layer of water coating mineral surfaces and advective flow does not occur this model is hereafter referred to as the leverett thermodynamic model ltm the ltm is applicable strictly at the continuum or representative elementary volume rev scale similar to the swrc therefore media characteristics not captured by the swrc would not be represented in the a aw predicted by the ltm 2 2 x ray microtomography dataset the results of the ltm predictions are compared to those presented by costanza robinson et al 2008 who reported a aw s w relationships developed from synchrotron x ray microtomography xmt measurements for glass bead media and model sands the xmt method is an imaging methodology that allows for the direct calculation of the a aw s w relationships the current interpretation of the xmt method results is that the a aw values provided represent the combined contributions of the areas associated with capillary water e g pendular rings at points of contact between mineral particles and adsorbed water films on wetted surfaces within the pores e g brusseau et al 2007 costanza robinson et al 2008 xmt cannot resolve interfacial area associated with microscale surface heterogeneity e g surface roughness when present and thus provides maximal a aw values that are nearly equivalent to the calculated smooth specific surface area of the porous media brusseau et al 2007 costanza robinson et al 2008 as presented by costanza robinson et al 2008 xmt provided linear a aw s w relationship models for each media type that had the following form after araujo and brusseau 2020 3 a aw gsa 1 s w where gsa is the geometric surface area of the medium l2 l3 based on the smoothed sphere assumption i e the medium is composed of a collection of smooth spheres of an identical diameter calculated as 4 gsa 6 1 n d 50 where n is the media porosity l3 l3 and d 50 is the median particle diameter l costanza robinson et al 2008 actually derived the following equation a aw sa 0 9031 0 9112s w however through our analysis we have found eq 4 to be a reasonable simplification to represent the measured data presented by costanza robinson et al 2008 hereafter eq 3 will be used to represent the xmt measured data for the soils used in this work 2 3 additional soil properties data additional soil properties data were derived from literature sources for two natural sands torrens et al 1998 costanza robinson 2001 brusseau et al 2006 peng and brusseau 2012 and used for comparison of ltm predictions for example measured vg parameters for two desert soils i e vinton sandy soil and hayhook sandy loam were obtained from the literature peng and brusseau 2012 and directly used to develop a aw s w relationships via the ltm approach soil textural data i e percentages of sand silt and clay were also derived from the literature for the same vinton soil costanza robinson 2001 and hayhook soil torrens et al 1998 that were used to develop vg parameters via the well known rosetta lite v 1 1 neural network model using the sscbd or h3 model described by schaap et al 2001 which included the bulk density œÅ b of the media as an additional predictive parameter finally the ltm approach was applied to vg parameter data i e specifically Œ± and n values derived from the pedotransfer function ptf presented by benson et al 2014 as described below 2 4 estimating vg model Œ± and n parameters vg model parameters Œ± and n for each media type evaluated in this work were developed using the pedotransfer function presented by benson et al 2014 hereafter referred to as the benson ptf which allows correction of vg parameters Œ± and n for changes in the particle size distribution based on changes in the uniformity coefficient c u for Œ± as 1 kpa drying curve case from benson et al 2014 5 Œ± 1 d 1 34 d 60 6 n Œ± 0 99 c u 0 54 where Œ± 1d is the Œ± for c u 1 n Œ± is Œ± normalized by Œ± 1d and Œ± corrected for c u is Œ± 1d n Œ± d 60 is the particle

n is n normalized by n 1d and n corrected for c u is n 1d n Œ± the benson ptf utilizes regressions based on d 60 for the media i e the soil particle diameter for which 60 of the total are finer by weight the d 60 values for the media used here were not reported however the d 50 values were for reasonably uniform porous media the near equivalence of d 60 and d 50 values can be and was assumed herein 3 results and discussion 3 1 porous media properties porous media properties and vg parameters compiled and calculated for this evaluation are provided in table 1 for the various glass bead media calculated vg parameters Œ± and n are consistent with both measured values as well as values calculated using alternative theoretical packing arrangements of spherical particles benson et al 2014 sweijen et al 2017 likewise calculated Œ± and n are consistent with reported measured values for the accusand media schroth et al 1996 according to the benson ptf Œ± values follow a linearly increasing trend with increasing values of the d 60 for these media calculated n values trend as a decreasing power law function with increasing c u for the vinton soil Œ± an n values show some variability for the different parameter estimation methods used i e coefficients of variation cv 25 and 15 for the estimates of Œ± and n respectively the estimated values are reasonable for this type of soil 3 2 vg parameters Œ± and n and the effect on a aw prediction the effect of soil texture on the values of the vg equation Œ± and n parameters used to represent the swrc is well known for clean sands and other coarse granular porous media there is a strong relationship between particle pore size distribution and the character of the swrc yang et al 1994 benson et al 2014 for uniform porous media a decrease in Œ± relates to an increase in the air entry pressure suction with a slight increase in the slope of the swrc i e a decrease in the magnitude of n between Œ∏ s and Œ∏ r as the particle size becomes finer as the particle size distribution becomes increasingly non uniform air entry pressures and thus the value of Œ± will vary depending on the nature of the particle size distribution and corresponding changes in particle packing arrangements however it is the slope of the swrc and thus the magnitude of n that is most affected by the degree of particle size non uniformity when using eq 1 and eq 2 to describe the a aw s w relationship the impacts of Œ± and n on the shape of the swrc are described below swrcs and their corresponding a aw s w relationships calculated for the glass beads and model sands used in this evaluation are presented in fig 1 as demonstrated for the uniform and spherical glass beads fig 1a and d a decrease in particle size and a corresponding decrease in Œ± results in an increase in the air entry pressure for the swrc and a corresponding increase in the overall slope of the a aw s w relationship mathematically increased a aw with decreasing particle size occurs due to the overall increase in the integrated area under the swrc mechanistically however a reduction in particle size relates to an increase in the gsa and thus an overall increase in calculated a aw for s w 1 as demonstrated for the glass bead mixture the reduction in n increases the degree of curvature of the a aw s w relationship as s w decreases which is also the case for the corresponding swrc the a aw s w relationships for the granusil sand mixture also exhibit an increasing degree of curvature albeit less than those observed for the spherical glass beads in this case the a aw values predicted are overall greater than those predicted for the glass bead mixture despite the fact that the c u for the glass bead mixture is a factor of 1 6 greater than that of the granusil mixture the differences in these a aw s w relationships are the result of the differences in the d 50 reported for these sand mixtures which impact the Œ± and n values provided by the benson ptf from this analysis it is observed that for uniform sandy porous media the particle pore size and thus the magnitude of Œ± plays a dominant role in the magnitude of a aw values predicted by the ltm as the particle size distribution becomes increasingly less uniform i e a wider particle size distribution the contribution of the n parameter to the predicted a aw values become increasingly important 3 3 comparing literature derived xmt results to ltm predictions the results of eq 3 based on the xmt results presented by costanza robinson et al 2008 are represented in fig 1 to provide a comparison to the ltm predictions for the glass beads the a aw s w relationships predicted by the ltm using the Œ± and n values provided by the benson ptf are very similar to those provided by the xmt measurements both methods practically predict the same maximum interfacial areas i e the endpoint a aw prediction at s w 0 which are estimated using the smooth surface gsa values represented in table 1 for the fine glass bead media the ltm prediction deviates upward from the xmt results with increasing separation as s w approaches s r which results from the lower value of Œ± provided by the benson ptf in response to the decrease in particle size costanza robinson et al 2008 describe the xmt results as being less accurate for the fine bead media due to the poor image segmentation quality that resulted in only a qualitative estimation of a aw values however both methods provided reasonably similar a aw s w relationships this is true for the highly uniform and largely spherical accusand media as well e g particle roundness 0 8 sphericity 0 8 0 9 schroth et al 1996 hamamoto et al 2016 the observed similarity in a aw values implies that both methods are characterizing the same effective interfacial areas for these uniform spherical and smooth porous media for the glass bead mixture the a aw values predicted by the ltm are overall greater than those by the xmt method in this case it appears that the xmt may be underestimating a aw values for this mixture costanza robinson et al 2008 noted that pore water within the xmt imaged bead mixture sample was observed to be non uniformly distributed within the images analyzed due to preferential capillary filling of small pores associated with the fine bead fraction i e a presented imaged section for the bead mixture sample used in the analysis shows an area of water associated with the fine bead fraction that encompasses roughly a third of the image area whereas pore water was observed to be homogeneously distributed in the uniform bead media sample images the presence of heterogeneously distributed water in the non uniform sample is not surprising in and of itself however it calls into question whether the a aw value estimated from this sampled image would be reproducible for another sampling at the same moisture condition and at the scale of measurement this issue also raises the question as to whether the sample scale for the xmt measurement meets the requirement of a rev for this non uniformly sized glass bead mixture complications related to the revs and xmt a aw calculations for non uniform media have been recently documented costanza robinson et al 2011 wang et al 2019 the increased slope of the ltm predicted a aw s w relationship is the result of the reduction in the Œ± parameter provided for this non uniform bead mixture c u 4 6 for the vg equation parameters vary systematically with the median particle size Œ± should decrease as the median particle size decreases and as the breadth of the particle size distribution increases and n should decrease as the breadth of the particle size distribution increases benson et al 2014 a aw values for the granusil sands predicted by the ltm again using Œ± and n values provided by the benson ptf were also overall larger than those for the xmt results for both the fine and coarse grained fractions and the mixture however the reason for the difference in a aw values in this case does not appear to be related to the heterogeneous pore water distribution issues observed for the glass bead mixture the pore water distribution in the xmt images presented by costanza robinson et al 2008 appears to be more uniform within the granusil sands in all cases here we interpret the differences between xmt and ltm estimates as being related to the granusil sands angularity roundness 0 2 sphericity 0 7 hamamoto et al 2016 and increased roughness of the particle surfaces as noted by costanza robinson et al 2008 the xmt method uses surface smoothing algorithms to minimize imaging artifacts as a part of estimating a aw values which removes micro scale surface topographic heterogeneity i e surface roughness of media particles xmt therefore provides smoothed surface estimates of a aw that compare well with gsa values conversely previous research has shown that particle surface roughness is captured in the results of media fluid retention curves dullien et al 1989 zheng et al 2015 with respect to the swrc the angularity of the granusil media allows greater packing density than for more rounded sands of the same particle size which results in an smaller pores and subsequently an increased air entry pressure for this media during drainage with a corresponding reduction in the vg Œ± parameter likewise an increased media surface roughness would also manifest in a reduced Œ± parameter the net effect of these media characteristics would then be an increased slope of the a aw s w relationship predicted by the ltm than would be measured by xmt as demonstrated in fig 1f given the agreement between measured data and the predicted swrcs shown in fig 1c the benton ptf appears to be providing vg parameters that are indirectly but appropriately accounting for the effects of the angularity and surface roughness of the granusil sands 3 4 comparing xmt and ltm predictions for natural sandy soils the majority of the existing literature data relating to estimating a aw for unsaturated porous media is limited to some model sands i e constructed using well sorted sand fractions and a few sandy soils i e the vinton and hayhook soils described previously relevant data collected for these sands are also presented in table 1 to our knowledge when this paper was prepared xmt measurement data had been only reported for the vinton soil brusseau et al 2006 the ltm was applied using vg parameters derived from the benson ptf published measured parameters and those derived from the rosetta model as described in section 2 2 for the rosetta model the textural classification of the vinton soil was 97 sand 1 8 silt 1 2 clay and œÅ d 1 46 costanza robinson 2001 peng and brusseau 2005 likewise the hayhook soil was classified as containing 86 sand 4 7 silt and 8 8 clay torrens et al 1998 with œÅ b 1 64 g cm 3 peng and brusseau 2005 the a aw s w relationships developed for the vinton and hayhook soils fig 2 demonstrate the dependence of the ltm prediction on the selection of Œ± and n provided by different parameter estimation methods selected note that for both soils the benson ptf predicts lower Œ± values table 1 which translates to a higher air entry pressure for the swrcs and increased a aw values than those predicted when using the other methods at the same s w fig 2 additionally the benson ptf provides values of n that are larger than those derived using the other methods in comparing the swrcs derived from the benson ptf and the measured vg parameters for these natural sandy soils the benson ptf appears to overestimate the moisture retention contribution of the fines fraction at higher s w as noted by benson et al 2014 the ptf was developed using sands for which the fine fraction i e particles 0 075 mm was removed therefore exclusion of the fines fraction appears to be weighting the effect of c u more heavily on the predicted value of Œ± than on the value of n when fines exist in the sample and for c u 2 to correct this the following simple modification to the benson ptf was made 9 n Œ± 0 99 c u 0 2 and 10 n n c u 2 2 0 0033 c u 0 279 applying these corrected equations the resulting values of Œ± for the vinton and hayhook soils drying curve become 0 026 cm 1 and 0 02 cm 1 respectively likewise the n values for these same soils become 3 53 and 2 91 respectively as shown in fig 2 using these corrected parameters results in swrcs and a aw s w relationships that closely match those derived from the measured vg parameters this is particularly the case for the hayhook soil where the fines fraction is more considerable while additional measured a aw s w relationships for natural soils would be needed to validate the corrections made here to the benson ptf these results indicate that it is possible that a simple correction to the ptf could render it more useful for estimating a aw s w relationships by the ltm for natural sandy soils containing fines this discussion highlights the importance of obtaining swrcs that are most representative of the vadose zone soils in question when using the ltm approach to derive a aw s w relationships it is additionally important to note that applying the ltm approach is not limited to using vg based models to characterize soil water retention characteristics other models including the brooks corey model e g oostrom et al 2001 can also be used 3 5 comparisons with aqueous tracer based methods in addition to the xmt methods air water interfacial adsorbing tracers have also been used to estimate a aw these have included both gas phase tracers gt and aqueous phase tracers at the gt methods have been shown to provide a aw values that are significantly greater than those provided by aqueous tracers with a aw approaching the area of the media determined by bet measurement as s w 0 peng and brusseau 2012 the xmt methods provide maximal a aw values that closely match the gsa for uniform media with smooth surface areas the fact that the a aw s w relationships provided by the ltm closely match those of the xmt methods for the uniform smooth and spherical media categories implies that the ltm is a good predictor of the interfacial area associated with natural pore water drainage and imbibition leverett 1941 kibbey and chen 2012 the at methods have also been shown to provide a aw values that were consistent with xmt results for smooth glass bead media e g el ouni et al 2021 indicating both methods are quantifying the same interfacial areas see e g fig 3 glass bead comparison however for some model sands and natural soils the at methods have provided a aw values that are greater than those measured by xmt with maximal values falling between those measured by the gt and xmt methods as demonstrated in fig 3 the xmt and ltm methods provide lower a aw values than the at methods for the accusand media and vinton soil the two at methods shown represent the results of both advecting aqueous tracer a at methods and those determined by mass balance mb methods schaefer et al 2000 araujo et al 2015 for the accusand 40 50 grade d 50 0 35 mm sand in all cases the a at data presented in fig 3 was derived from the published results of two separate experiments using different interfacial adsorbing tracers including one in which the pfas perfluorodecanoic acid pfda was used as a tracer and performed under different flow and input concentration conditions brusseau et al 2015 brusseau et al 2020 these a at experiments provide similar a aw s w relationships fig 3 however the extent to which these a at experiments can characterize a aw s w relationships is limited to the higher range of s w e g s w 0 5 given the difficulty in maintaining a steady and uniform flow condition at lower s w for these types of experiments the mb method results derived from the published results of schaefer et al 2000 generally exhibit the same linear trending a aw s w relationship for the accusand media as that provided by the a at results the mb method is considered a viable approach to quantifying a aw at lower s w conditions because it does not rely on flow but rather on the equilibrium distribution of tracer between the interface and other environmental compartments however the approach does result in more scatter in the a aw s w data brusseau 2020 noted that the scatter in the mb method is a potential limitation of the method the results provided by araujo et al 2015 also presented in fig 3 for the same accusand sand exhibit considerably more scatter in the data with a aw values that are considerably greater than those provided by schaefer et al 2000 while it might be tempting to plot a line through the cloud of datapoints this approach is not tenable given that this ignores the results of schaefer et al 2000 who used a similar approach and the same sand results similar to schaefer et al 2000 were reported by chen and kibbey 2006 for f110 ottawa sand undergoing multiple draining cycles using sodium octylbenzene sulfonate as a surface active tracer and an alternative measurement method the uncertainty in the mb measured a aw values for the vinton sand is even more significant as a result going forward we will rely on the a at dataset as a basis for comparing results the disparity between the xmt data and the a at a aw values has been attributed to the ability of the tracer to access the interfacial area associated with micro scale rough particle surfaces that is too small to be resolved by the xmt methods e g brusseau et al 2006 brusseau et al 2007 mcdonald et al 2016 that is the a at method is characterizing both a aw associated with capillary held pendular water and some additional fraction of the a aw associated with pore surface films of water that is impacted by the microscale roughness of the surface however the effect of surface roughness on the magnitude of the total a aw existing within an unsaturated porous media is a topic of continuing research and debate for example using stereoscopic scanning electron microscopy sem methods and surface configuration modeling kibbey 2013 demonstrated that surface associated water remains held to the surface via capillary tension which results in a significantly smoother air water interfacial surface than that of the underlying solid surface as a result the impact of surface roughness on the a aw was shown to be greatly minimized during drainage for capillary pressure heads less than 100 cm a capillary pressure head of 100 cm or less would be needed to drain most of the media included in this evaluation to residual saturation including the vinton soil this would suggest that these same media should present a smooth air water interface for these surfaces under normal drainage with the magnitude of a aw associated with these wetted surfaces being well characterized by the xmt methods further if water associated with surface roughness is held by capillarity the presence of this water should be represented in the swrc as demonstrated in the literature e g dullien et al 1989 zheng et al 2015 therefore the ltm a aw s w relationship predictions should be additionally representative this was also the position of kibbey and chen 2012 who contend that the ltm provides the maximum possible area formed during natural drainage the utility of the a at method to characterize interfacial areas was further challenged by kibbey and chen 2012 who used pore network modeling to demonstrate that neither diffusion nor head driven flow was sufficient to allow access to surface films i e those presumed to be associated with the increased a aw for a at these authors also suggested that in the absence of additional experimental artifacts surface charge or surface tension gradient driven advection would be needed for surface active tracers to access these surface films this possibility was examined by costanza robinson and henry 2017 who performed a numerical modeling study to demonstrate the impact of surface tension induced flow potentially providing artificially enhanced a aw values determined by the a at methods however given the reported reproducibility of the a at results for experiments using different tracers at different concentrations brusseau et al 2015 brusseau et al 2020 and the recent method validity evaluation provided by el ouni et al 2021 who demonstrated that bulk surface tension induced flow and other potential experimental artifacts were not relevant it is difficult to ignore the a at measurements in their modeling evaluation kibbey and chen 2012 did not include the effects of microscopic surface roughness an omission that was thereafter addressed by jiang et al 2019 who showed that including surface roughness resulted in the same monotonic increases in a aw values at high to moderate s w values and exponentially increasing a aw values at low s w as observed by the gt methods however while jiang et al 2019 demonstrate that these higher a aw values could be caused by surface roughness at lower s w and that the resulting a aw s w relationships can be made to match measured data they did not extend this evaluation to include a reason as to how these surface active tracers would contact this additional surface roughness associated interfacial area during aqueous transport under an assumed uniform and constant soil moisture condition kibbey 2013 demonstrated a thicker layer of water associated with rough surfaces and suggested that diffusion of solutes within this thicker capillary held surface associated water may be possible wherein diffusive rates may increase by roughly two orders of magnitude due to the resulting larger cross sectional areas for diffusion this diffusive mechanism could in turn allow surface active tracers to contact a larger portion of the total interfacial area thus yielding larger at measured a aw values than would be the case for a smooth surfaced media diffusion of solutes into and out of these thickened surface associated water films could have contributed to the rate limited diffusional mass transfer characterized in the column experiments presented by brusseau 2020 for the water unsaturated transport of non reactive and surface active solutes between advective and non advective domains therefore it is possible that this thickened film diffusive mass transfer could be contributing to the disparity between the a aw values provided by the a at and ltm alternatively and despite the convincing discussions provided by el ouni et al 2021 and brusseau et al 2020 it seems likely that a surface active tracer adsorbing to an air water interface would impact the magnitude of the interfacial area it is accesing for measurement the a at method is physically a chromatographic technique that assumes that the stationary phase i e the air water interface in this case has a constant area spatially and temporally during the test while this can be reliably assumed to be the case for solid adsorbent media fluid fluid interfacial areas are generally not as stable in the context of the previous discussion perturbations in the surface charge or surface pressure tension of the air water interface due to interfacial adsorption even at a very low concentration could still disrupt cohesive forces between water molecules at the interface enough to modify the configuration of water films associated with rough surfaces these perturbations might not be significant enough to drain interparticle pendular water but could cause a localized displacement of water films or deformation of water film surfaces that could manifest as a localized increase in a aw as the pulse of the surface active tracer moves through the porous medium for the a at method this increased interfacial area would increase tracer retention and ultimately provide a larger measured a aw value than would be predicted by the ltm at the same s w it is unlikely that this type of film water displacement would be observable at the column or continuum scale in this context the a at method would then provide an effective a aw for these amphiphilic surface active tracers and not necessarily the true a aw for the unsaturated medium which has been reported to be provided by the ltm kibbey and chen 2012 as shown in fig 3 when the surface roughness is absent both the a at and ltm methods predict the same a aw s w relationship which strengthens the argument that surface roughness is a key factor in the a at results 3 6 modifying the ltm to include tracer accessible area while the causal mechanisms are not fully understood the experimental results presented in the literature suggest that aqueous interfacial tracers are measuring higher a aw values than those predicted by the ltm and the discrepancy appears to be related to changes in the degree of surface roughness of the porous media see fig 3 table 1 this is not necessarily problematic for pfas because these chemicals like the tracers used for the a at method are also surface active and amphiphilic therefore a aw s w relationships that are representative of surface active solutes are needed for predicting the retention contribution of air water interfacial adsorption during transport what is problematic is that continuum models like the ltm do not account for the observed effects of surface active solutes and surface roughness the following modification to the ltm is proposed to correct this discrepancy the modification applies a direct surface roughness multiplier srm to the a aw s w relationship provided by the ltm recall eq 1 this simple approach allows the ltm prediction to continue to include the effects of particle size uniformity and differences in packing density as it relates to particle angularity as governed by the swrc for capillary water while also capturing the contributive effects of surface roughness on the magnitude of a aw at a given moisture condition using the a at data as the benchmark a aw s w relationship in this application the srm values needed to match the a at a aw s w relationship for the accusand and vinton soil examples are 2 4 and 3 3 respectively the results of applying the srm to the accusand and vinton soil a aw s w relationships are also presented in fig 3 note that the srm adjusted ltm result for the accusand media maintains a more linear trending a aw s w relationship with decreasing s w owing to the particle size uniformity of the model sand this result is consistent with the mb tracer results of schaefer et al 2000 the sphericity and uniformity of the sand and the low soil surface roughness factor srf calculated for this sand i e srf 18 for the medium accusand as in table 1 in contrast the srm adjusted ltm result for the natural vinton soil exhibits a more distinct non linearly increasing a aw s w relationship with decreasing s w consistent with the increased fines fraction less uniform particle size distribution and factor of 18 6 increase in the srf for this soil as compared to the model sand it is important also to note that this approach does not attempt to characterize the significantly increased a aw values observed by the gt results at lower s w in keeping with the limitations of the ltm leverett 1941 bradford and leij 1997 the low s w endpoint of the srm adjusted a aw s w relationships are truncated at the residual saturation for a given porous media which is appropriate for unsaturated transport under aqueous advection i e advective flow is not expected when water content is below residual saturation to guide the selection of srm values for other natural soils a soil surface roughness factor srf initially proposed by wenzel 1936 and applied more recently by others when evaluating a aw s w relationships e g brusseau et al 2007 costanza robinson et al 2008 jiang et al 2019 was used as additionally described in table 1 the srf is redefined here as 11 srf n 2 bet area gsa where gsa is the smooth geometric surface of the soil calculated using eq 4 properties for 21 arizona soils were collected from the literature i e arthur et al 2012 ghanbarian et al 2021 this data is provided in table 2 in addition to the srf ghanbarian et al 2021 provided measured soil surface fractal dimensions d s for each of these same soils from water retention curves that were used to additionally characterize soil surface roughness d s is an index of the topographical complexity of soil surfaces as it relates to scale and characterizes the change in surface roughness between soil textural classifications as these d s values were derived from water retention data they are representative of the degree of surface roughness at the continuum scale in keeping with the ltm predictions the three dimensional d s values vary between 2 and 3 pfeifer et al 1983 wang et al 2005 a value of 2 indicates a smooth surface and a value of 3 corresponds to an extremely rough soil particle surface as observed in table 2 d s values generally increase with increasing clay content d s values ranging between 2 09 and 2 3 have been documented for model sands similar to those described in table 1 avnir et al 1985 yang et al 2016 the d s values were used to approximate the rate of change of surface roughness for these soils relative to their corresponding srf values as shown in fig 4a this slope was then used in concert with the srfs and srms determined for the accusand and vinton soil to provide data with which to develop an empirical model to estimate srm values for soils of varied texture a langmuir like equation was used to fit the accusand and vinton data and the slope of the d s srf relationship was used to scale the extrapolation of the model with increasing srf the results of this work are presented in fig 4b note that the proposed srm srf model is scaled such that srm 1 when srf 1 which defines a smooth surface condition consistent with the a aw s w results for the glass bead case shown in fig 3 additionally in keeping with the trend provided by the d s srf relationship srm values do not exceed a value of 3 5 as srf values increase unfortunately no additional a aw s w data for natural soils was found in the published literature precluding further validation of the proposed srf srm model this lack of a aw s w relationship data presents a significant data gap for this area of research and is problematic with respect to assessing the fate and transport of surface active contaminants like pfas as there is a growing need to model pfas transport in vadose zones comprised of soils of varied textural classification strictly the srf srm model would be most applicable to sands and predominantly sandy soils similar to those described herein on the other hand for soils with broad particle size distributions e g loams and clayey soils it is possible that the effects of surface roughness on the a aw s w relationship could be overwhelmed by the contributions of interparticle capillary effects obviating the need for correcting the ltm prediction therefore more research is needed to determine the importance of surface rougness on a aw values for a wider variety of natural soils and sediments particularly with respect to supporting site scale modeling however the proposed srf srm model provides a practical first approximation method that incorporates the effects of surface roughness on a aw estimates provided by the ltm where the srm can be estimated from common soil textural classification measurements i e the bet specific surface area of the soil sample and the median particle size or d 50 examples of ltm predicted a aw s w relationships are compared in fig 5 to their corresponding srm corrected relationships for a few sandy soils and a loam selected from table 2 textural data from table 2 was used as input to the rosetta model described previously to provide vg parameters and generate swrcs that were then used to generate ltm predictions texturally the sand and loamy sand results are most consistent with the vinton soil and the hayhook soil as are the predicted a aw s w relationships regarding the loamy sand predictions the srm adjusted a aw s w relationship closely matches that of the srm adjusted sand results until s w 0 5 a aw values increase considerably thereafter representing the effect of surface roughness on the magnitude of the a aw with increased pore water drainage at the continuum scale as the fines content of the soil increase predicted a aw values increase for the sandy loam and loam soils predicted a aw values are roughly a factor of 10 greater than those of the sand and loamy sand as s w falls below 0 2 in these cases it is important to consider that field capacities for a typical sandy loam and loam soil range between Œ∏ 0 18 0 28 and Œ∏ 0 25 0 32 respectively or s w 0 47 0 73 and s w 0 6 0 76 respectively under typical field conditions these soils should retain enough moisture to limit the magnitude of the a aw and the contribution of awi adsorption during pfas transport however this would not necessarily hold true for soils positioned at the ground surface in an arid environment where much lower water saturations could be achieved via evaporative losses where a aw values could be large and pfas could be significantly retained within the shallow vadose zone as a result 3 7 the significance of the a aw s w relationship on transport the potential effect of this a aw variability on pfas retardation factors r is demonstrated for pfos a representative pfas and is presented in fig 6 r values were calculated using the following equation 12 r 1 œÅ b k d Œ∏ k aw a aw Œ∏ where œÅ b is the soil bulk density m l3 k d is the solid phase sorption coefficient l3 m1 k aw is the air water adsorption coefficient l and Œ∏ s w n as presented eq 12 assumes linear solid phase sorption and that sorption and air water interfacial adsorption are the only sources of retention sorption coefficients k d were 0 16 and 1 2 cm3 g for the accusand and vinton soil respectively and were derived from the linear model fit to the data presented by van glubt et al 2021 for solute concentrations 1 mg l other parameters used in these calculations were œÅ b 1 5 g cm3 and k aw 0 026 cm the results of these calculations fig 6 demonstrate not only the variability in pfos retention but also the importance of using the appropriate a aw s w relationship when surface active solutes are being considered because vadose zone pfas retention could be greatly misrepresented finally it is important to note that all a aw s w relationships used in this work were derived from data representing drainage conditions the magnitude of a aw values in the vadose zone will be impacted by transient cycles of drainage and imbibition wetting during natural infiltration events while leverett 1941 demonstrates the ltm could be applied to both drainage and imbibition conditions characterized by separate swrcs and potentially providing different a aw s w relationships for each condition the validity of this application with respect to the transport of pfas has not been using a at methods and the vinton soil brusseau et al 2007 observed that a aw s w relationships measured under both drainage and imbibition conditions were similar and cited the importance of surface roughness associated water films for the similarity in measured a aw values schaefer et al 2000 also observed similar a aw s w relationships under drainage and imbibition conditions using mb methods however both studies utilized a surface active tracer i e sodium dodecyl benzenesulfonate at concentrations that would promote interfacial tension reduction and could have altered the moisture retention characteristics that would have been observed for water without surfactant therefore additional research is needed on this topic 4 conclusions when performing calculations or numerical simulations of the fate and transport of pfas and other surface active solutes in the vadose zone and accurate a aw s w relationship is needed most research has focused on accurate characterization of interfacial adsorption coefficients and the associated concentration dependence however capturing changes in the a aw s w relationship relationship that result from changes in soil texture is equally important indeed accurate determination of the a aw s w relationship is arguably more important when one considers the challenges in characterizing heterogeneity at both the pore and continuum scale and its relationship to the swrc and a aw s w relationship in this work the well known ltm model is compared to two methods for the determination of the a aw s w relationship microtomography and aqueous tracer methods the ltm model is favored here due to its simplicity and because it represents the change in the magnitude of the a aw with changes in s w at the continuum scale consistent with practical methods used to model pfas transport i e continuum mechanics behind the swrc and the application of the richards equation for unsaturated flow in addition the ltm method is less time consuming and expensive yet appropriately captures the effects of soil particle size uniformity in the particle size distribution and differences in packing density on the a aw s w relationship the xmt the a at method and the ltm were found to provide very similar a aw s w relationships when the porous media surface is smooth i e glass beads suggesting each method characterizes the same effective interfacial area in these cases however both the ltm and a at methods provide larger a aw values than measured by the xmt method for non uniform increasingly angular media or when the surfaces of the media become rougher as characterized by the proposed srf the a at method was shown to provide a aw values that are consistently greater than both the xmt and ltm results for a given s w with the degree of difference increasing with increased surface roughness consistent with the conclusions drawn from literature sources wherein much of the a at data was obtained the a at method utilizes surface active solutes as tracers to characterize a aw at the continuum scale in porous media columns these tracers appear to be sampling portions of the air water interface that are not represented by either the ltm prediction or xlm measurements while the exact mechanism for this disparity is uncertain it appears that the degree of microscale surface roughness is a dominant contributing factor because the at method uses tracers that are surface active and the contaminants of interest in this work are also surface active it is reasonable to conclude the tracers themselves may influence the interfacial area thus the a at data provides the most representative a aw values for surface active solutes like pfas in addition the ltm and similar thermodynamic methods likely provide a true measure of the a aw under natural drainage conditions a conclusion based on the presentations of kibbey and chen 2012 and kibbey 2013 and on the similarity in predicted a aw s w relationships when media surfaces are smooth using the literature derived a at measured a aw s w relationships as a benchmark for surface active tracers the ltm prediction was modified to include the effects of surface roughness on the predicted a aw s w relationship by applying a direct multiplier to the ltm prediction to account for surface roughness i e the srm an empirical model was developed using the measured data to estimate the magnitude of the srm with changes in calculated srf values as soil textural classifications change because this empirical model was developed from a limited dataset it should be considered to provide only first order estimates additional measured a aw s w relationships for a wider variety of soil textures are needed for a more robust test of this empirical model however in the absence of this additional data the approach provides a practical method for calculating or simulating pfas mass transport in the vadose zone and accounting for the effects of surface roughness on a aw s w relationships finally because the representativeness of the a aw s w relationships predicted by the ltm depends on the representativeness of the swrc used methods of estimating vg parameters that define the swrcs were compared the accuracy of the rosetta model was found to improve when fines e g particles 0 0075 mm are present in the soil for non uniform sandy soils without fines the benson ptf which corrects predictions for changes in the uniformity of porous media particles was shown to best match measured swrcs for the sands presented in this work the benson ptf was also modified to account for the presence of fines which greatly improved the accuracy of the a aw s w relationship prediction for the natural soils used in this work compared to that derived from the measured swrcs however as with all ptfs including the rosetta model it is important to understand the operational

1321,when performing calculations or numerical simulations for the fate and transport of pfas and other surface active solutes in the vadose zone accurately representing the relationship between the area of the air water interfaces a aw as a function of water saturation s w and changes in that relationship resulting from changes in soil texture are equally important as accurately characterizing interfacial adsorption coefficients and the concentration dependence for pfas solutes this is true because the magnitude of the a aw directly governs the degree of air water interfacial adsorption which contributes to the transport retardation of these solutes within unsaturated porous media herein a well known thermodynamic based model for predicting the a aw s w relationship is evaluated through comparisons to literature data collected using various measurement techniques for model sands and a limited number of soils using data collected from the current published literature this predictive model herein termed the leverett thermodynamic model ltm relies on the characterization of the soil water retention curve swrc for a given soil using the van genuchten vg equation for the pressure head vs s w relationship therefore methods to estimate the vg equation parameters are also compared as to the a aw s w relationships predicted comparisons suggest that the ltm provides the best estimate of the actual a aw s w relationships for water containing non surface active solutes because pfas solutes are also surface active a aw measurement methods utilizing surface active tracers are considered to provide the most accurate representation of the a aw s w relationship for these solutes differences between a aw s w relationships derived from tracer methods and the ltm are described in relation to media surface roughness effects based on the available literature data a practical empirical model is proposed to adjust the ltm prediction to account for the effects of surface roughness on the magnitude of the a aw for surface active solutes finally example retention calculations are performed to demonstrate the sensitivity of the predicted a aw s w relationship on the vadose zone transport of of a representative pfas perfluorooctane sulfonate keywords pfas air water interfacial adsorption air water interfacial area vadose zone transport soil texture and surface roughness effects modeling 1 introduction per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas are a class of emerging contaminants that have received significant attention in recent years due to human health concerns their widespread use and distribution in the environment and their general resistance to degradation in the environment pfas groundwater contamination is often associated with the leaching of these compounds from commercial products initially deposited in unlined landfills or on the ground surface e g from land applied bio solids and past releases of aqueous film forming foam afff products at fire training areas in these release scenarios pfas must first transport through the vadose zone prior to reaching underlying aquifers pfas has been shown to accumulate within the shallow vadose zone serving as a long term source of groundwater contamination shin et al 2011 xiao et al 2015 weber et al 2017 anderson et al 2006 anderson et al 2019 therefore it is important to understand and characterize pfas fate and transport mechanisms within the vadose zone to better assist environmental risk assessment and future remediation decision making pfas are surface active chemicals i e surfactants as surfactants pfas will accumulate at fluid interfaces during transport through the vadose zone of particular interest in this paper is the adsorption of pfas at air water interfaces awi although other important interfacial processes have been identified as additional contributors to overall pfas retention e g guelfo and higgins 2013 mckenzie et al 2016 brusseau 2018 pfas adsorption at awis is significant under certain conditions e g brusseau 2018 silva et al 2019 guo et al 2020 silva et al 2020 depending on the specific surface activity of a given pfas and the magnitude of the area of the awi a aw a aw is inversely related to volumetric water content Œ∏ w or water saturation s w Œ∏ w porosity variability in aaw depends on the particle size distribution in water content which in turn depends on textural properties of the vadose zone soil each of these dependencies can vary spatially and temporally within the vadose zone environment complicating transport calculations methods to characterize the a aw s w relationship have included theoretical models based on empirical relationships or assumptions of pore geometry e g leverett 1941 bradford and leij 1997 gvirtzman and roberts 1991 or and tuller 1999 oostrom et al 2001 jiang et al 2019 and experimental measurement methods utilizing surface active gas phase and aqueous phase chemical tracers e g kakare and fort 1996 kim et al 1997 silva 1997 kim et al 1999 schaefer et al 2000 costanza robinson 2001 silva et al 2002 araujo et al 2015 brusseau et al 2020 more recently direct imaging via x ray microtomography xmt methods have additionally been employed e g brusseau et al 2007 costanza robinson et al 2008 araujo and brusseau 2020 the various methods used for a aw measurement methods have been shown to provide different a aw values for a given s w value as well as different a aw s w relationships particularly at lower moisture conditions for example xmt methods provide linear a aw s w relationships throughout the entire range of s w gas phase tracer methods i e those in which a gaseous or vaporous tracer is introduced to a mobile air phase and where the aqueous phase and a aw are assumed static typically provide highly non linear a aw s w relationships and a aw values are considerably greater than those provided by other measurement methods with respect to aqueous tracer methods there are two main types the first type involves introducing the interfacial tracer with aqueous advection wherein the tracer contacts the available interfacial area under steady unsaturated flow e g brusseau et al 2015 and references therein for the second method the tracer solution is introduced to an unsaturated sand column and the a aw is estimated via a mass balance calculation from the equilibrium mass of tracer lost from the test column when allowed to drain to a steady state moisture condition schaefer et al 2000 araujo et al 2015 schaefer et al 2000 observed linear a aw s w relationships while araujo et al 2015 using similar methods observed a non linear increasing trend in a aw with increasing s w both gaseous and aqueous tracer methods provide a aw values that are greater than those derived from xmt measurements at the same s w condition and the differences increase with decreasing s w the differences in a aw values provided by the different measurement methods has been argued to result from each method characterizing different fractions of the total a aw e g a aw associated with capillary held pendular water and a aw associated with thin water films adsorbed to mineral surfaces e g costanza robinson 2001 brusseau et al 2006 the variability in a aw s w relationships presented in the literature can lead to confusion over which relationships are most appropriate when performing fate and transport calculations for pfas or other surface active solutes the most commonly held view based on the collective literature to date is to use a aw s w relationships that best represent the transport conditions being investigated for pfas of current environmental concern transport within the vadose zone occurs in the aqueous phase and a aw s w relationships derived from aqueous based methods would therefore be most representative silva et al 2020 guo et al 2020 brusseau et al 2020 brusseau et al 2019 as these methods are considered to characterize a aw accessible to surface active solutes present in the aqueous phase however discrepancies between these methods remain and too little data representative of a variety of soil types are available to make a clear judgment on the utility of the a aw s w relationships provided likewise the diversity of theoretical models available in the literature to predict the a aw s w relationship for a given porous media adds to the complexity and uncertainty herein the efficacy of one of several theoretical models to predict a aw s w relationships a modification of the thermodynamic based model first conceptualized by leverett 1941 hereafter referred to as the leverett thermodynamic model ltm is evaluated data used in this evaluation represents a variety of model porous media and natural sandy soils with the goal of improving the accuracy of transport calculations for pfas and other similarly surface active solutes this theoretical model has been used to simulate colloid and bacteria transport ≈°im≈Ønek et al 2016 and was recently implemented in an additional modified version of the hydrus unsaturated flow and transport model to simulate pfas transport in the vadose zone silva et al 2020 predicted results are compared to a aw s w relationships derived from the literature that utilized xmt and aqueous tracer based measurements a aw s w relationships predicted by the ltm method are directly dependent on the characteristics of the soil water retention curve swrc for a given porous media here the well known van genuchten vg equation was selected to model swrcs therefore evaluation and discussion of the impact of key vg equation parameters on predicted a aw s w relationships are additionally provided finally an empirical relationship is proposed that can be used to scale the ltm to be more representative of a aw values measured by surface active solutes thereby improving estimates of pfas retention within the vadose zone due to awi adsorption 2 materials and methods 2 1 awi area calculation the method used here to estimate a aw as it changes with soil water content Œ∏ was proposed by leverett 1941 and implemented by bradford et al 2015 as 1a a aw Œ∏ 1 Œ≥ o Œ∏ Œ∏ s p c Œ∏ dŒ∏ œÅ w g Œ≥ o Œ∏ Œ∏ s h Œ∏ dŒ∏ 1b d a aw Œ∏ d Œ∏ p c Œ≥ o œÅ w gh Œ≥ o where Œ∏ s is the saturated water content l3 l3 p c is the capillary pressure m lt2 h is the pressure head l Œ≥ 0 is the air water surface tension m t2 œÅ w is the density of water m l3 and g is the gravitational acceleration l t2 the integration provides a aw in units of l2 l3 or l 1 where the l3 term in the numerator is the total volume of air water and solid phases the magnitude of a aw increases with decreasing Œ∏ and approaches the geometric surface area gsa of the porous media as Œ∏ approaches the residual irreducible water content Œ∏ r this approach relies on a specific model characterizing the change in water content in response to a change in h here we selected the well known van genuchten vg model van genuchten 1980 2 Œ∏ h Œ∏ r Œ∏ s Œ∏ r 1 Œ±h n 1 1 n h 0 Œ∏ s h 0 where Œ∏ r has units of l3 l3 Œ± 1 l is a parameter related to the inverse of the air entry pressure head for the porous medium and n is a parameter related to the pore size distribution eq 1 describes the soil water retention curve swrc for a porous medium the use of eq 1 and similar methods to estimating a aw s w relationships have been previously referred to as the thermodynamic approach e g dalla et al 2002 grant and gerhard 2007 schroth et al 2008 because as proposed by leverett 1941 it relates changes in a aw to the thermodynamic work done within a unit volume of unsaturated porous media when changes in water contents occur due to changes in capillary pressure the integration of eq 1 i e the area under the swrc yields the a aw s w relationship the endpoint of the a aw prediction is the Œ∏ r for a given porous medium where it is assumed that soil moisture exists as pendular water and as a thin adsorbed layer of water coating mineral surfaces and advective flow does not occur this model is hereafter referred to as the leverett thermodynamic model ltm the ltm is applicable strictly at the continuum or representative elementary volume rev scale similar to the swrc therefore media characteristics not captured by the swrc would not be represented in the a aw predicted by the ltm 2 2 x ray microtomography dataset the results of the ltm predictions are compared to those presented by costanza robinson et al 2008 who reported a aw s w relationships developed from synchrotron x ray microtomography xmt measurements for glass bead media and model sands the xmt method is an imaging methodology that allows for the direct calculation of the a aw s w relationships the current interpretation of the xmt method results is that the a aw values provided represent the combined contributions of the areas associated with capillary water e g pendular rings at points of contact between mineral particles and adsorbed water films on wetted surfaces within the pores e g brusseau et al 2007 costanza robinson et al 2008 xmt cannot resolve interfacial area associated with microscale surface heterogeneity e g surface roughness when present and thus provides maximal a aw values that are nearly equivalent to the calculated smooth specific surface area of the porous media brusseau et al 2007 costanza robinson et al 2008 as presented by costanza robinson et al 2008 xmt provided linear a aw s w relationship models for each media type that had the following form after araujo and brusseau 2020 3 a aw gsa 1 s w where gsa is the geometric surface area of the medium l2 l3 based on the smoothed sphere assumption i e the medium is composed of a collection of smooth spheres of an identical diameter calculated as 4 gsa 6 1 n d 50 where n is the media porosity l3 l3 and d 50 is the median particle diameter l costanza robinson et al 2008 actually derived the following equation a aw sa 0 9031 0 9112s w however through our analysis we have found eq 4 to be a reasonable simplification to represent the measured data presented by costanza robinson et al 2008 hereafter eq 3 will be used to represent the xmt measured data for the soils used in this work 2 3 additional soil properties data additional soil properties data were derived from literature sources for two natural sands torrens et al 1998 costanza robinson 2001 brusseau et al 2006 peng and brusseau 2012 and used for comparison of ltm predictions for example measured vg parameters for two desert soils i e vinton sandy soil and hayhook sandy loam were obtained from the literature peng and brusseau 2012 and directly used to develop a aw s w relationships via the ltm approach soil textural data i e percentages of sand silt and clay were also derived from the literature for the same vinton soil costanza robinson 2001 and hayhook soil torrens et al 1998 that were used to develop vg parameters via the well known rosetta lite v 1 1 neural network model using the sscbd or h3 model described by schaap et al 2001 which included the bulk density œÅ b of the media as an additional predictive parameter finally the ltm approach was applied to vg parameter data i e specifically Œ± and n values derived from the pedotransfer function ptf presented by benson et al 2014 as described below 2 4 estimating vg model Œ± and n parameters vg model parameters Œ± and n for each media type evaluated in this work were developed using the pedotransfer function presented by benson et al 2014 hereafter referred to as the benson ptf which allows correction of vg parameters Œ± and n for changes in the particle size distribution based on changes in the uniformity coefficient c u for Œ± as 1 kpa drying curve case from benson et al 2014 5 Œ± 1 d 1 34 d 60 6 n Œ± 0 99 c u 0 54 where Œ± 1d is the Œ± for c u 1 n Œ± is Œ± normalized by Œ± 1d and Œ± corrected for c u is Œ± 1d n Œ± d 60 is the particle diameter l of which 60 of the particles in the soil sample are finer similarly n drying curve is calculated as 7 n 1 d 14 exp 0 434 d 60 8 n n c u 2 2 0 0033 c u 0 379 where n 1d is the n for c u 1 n n is n normalized by n 1d and n corrected for c u is n 1d n Œ± the benson ptf utilizes regressions based on d 60 for the media i e the soil particle diameter for which 60 of the total are finer by weight the d 60 values for the media used here were not reported however the d 50 values were for reasonably uniform porous media the near equivalence of d 60 and d 50 values can be and was assumed herein 3 results and discussion 3 1 porous media properties porous media properties and vg parameters compiled and calculated for this evaluation are provided in table 1 for the various glass bead media calculated vg parameters Œ± and n are consistent with both measured values as well as values calculated using alternative theoretical packing arrangements of spherical particles benson et al 2014 sweijen et al 2017 likewise calculated Œ± and n are consistent with reported measured values for the accusand media schroth et al 1996 according to the benson ptf Œ± values follow a linearly increasing trend with increasing values of the d 60 for these media calculated n values trend as a decreasing power law function with increasing c u for the vinton soil Œ± an n values show some variability for the different parameter estimation methods used i e coefficients of variation cv 25 and 15 for the estimates of Œ± and n respectively the estimated values are reasonable for this type of soil 3 2 vg parameters Œ± and n and the effect on a aw prediction the effect of soil texture on the values of the vg equation Œ± and n parameters used to represent the swrc is well known for clean sands and other coarse granular porous media there is a strong relationship between particle pore size distribution and the character of the swrc yang et al 1994 benson et al 2014 for uniform porous media a decrease in Œ± relates to an increase in the air entry pressure suction with a slight increase in the slope of the swrc i e a decrease in the magnitude of n between Œ∏ s and Œ∏ r as the particle size becomes finer as the particle size distribution becomes increasingly non uniform air entry pressures and thus the value of Œ± will vary depending on the nature of the particle size distribution and corresponding changes in particle packing arrangements however it is the slope of the swrc and thus the magnitude of n that is most affected by the degree of particle size non uniformity when using eq 1 and eq 2 to describe the a aw s w relationship the impacts of Œ± and n on the shape of the swrc are described below swrcs and their corresponding a aw s w relationships calculated for the glass beads and model sands used in this evaluation are presented in fig 1 as demonstrated for the uniform and spherical glass beads fig 1a and d a decrease in particle size and a corresponding decrease in Œ± results in an increase in the air entry pressure for the swrc and a corresponding increase in the overall slope of the a aw s w relationship mathematically increased a aw with decreasing particle size occurs due to the overall increase in the integrated area under the swrc mechanistically however a reduction in particle size relates to an increase in the gsa and thus an overall increase in calculated a aw for s w 1 as demonstrated for the glass bead mixture the reduction in n increases the degree of curvature of the a aw s w relationship as s w decreases which is also the case for the corresponding swrc the a aw s w relationships for the granusil sand mixture also exhibit an increasing degree of curvature albeit less than those observed for the spherical glass beads in this case the a aw values predicted are overall greater than those predicted for the glass bead mixture despite the fact that the c u for the glass bead mixture is a factor of 1 6 greater than that of the granusil mixture the differences in these a aw s w relationships are the result of the differences in the d 50 reported for these sand mixtures which impact the Œ± and n values provided by the benson ptf from this analysis it is observed that for uniform sandy porous media the particle pore size and thus the magnitude of Œ± plays a dominant role in the magnitude of a aw values predicted by the ltm as the particle size distribution becomes increasingly less uniform i e a wider particle size distribution the contribution of the n parameter to the predicted a aw values become increasingly important 3 3 comparing literature derived xmt results to ltm predictions the results of eq 3 based on the xmt results presented by costanza robinson et al 2008 are represented in fig 1 to provide a comparison to the ltm predictions for the glass beads the a aw s w relationships predicted by the ltm using the Œ± and n values provided by the benson ptf are very similar to those provided by the xmt measurements both methods practically predict the same maximum interfacial areas i e the endpoint a aw prediction at s w 0 which are estimated using the smooth surface gsa values represented in table 1 for the fine glass bead media the ltm prediction deviates upward from the xmt results with increasing separation as s w approaches s r which results from the lower value of Œ± provided by the benson ptf in response to the decrease in particle size costanza robinson et al 2008 describe the xmt results as being less accurate for the fine bead media due to the poor image segmentation quality that resulted in only a qualitative estimation of a aw values however both methods provided reasonably similar a aw s w relationships this is true for the highly uniform and largely spherical accusand media as well e g particle roundness 0 8 sphericity 0 8 0 9 schroth et al 1996 hamamoto et al 2016 the observed similarity in a aw values implies that both methods are characterizing the same effective interfacial areas for these uniform spherical and smooth porous media for the glass bead mixture the a aw values predicted by the ltm are overall greater than those by the xmt method in this case it appears that the xmt may be underestimating a aw values for this mixture costanza robinson et al 2008 noted that pore water within the xmt imaged bead mixture sample was observed to be non uniformly distributed within the images analyzed due to preferential capillary filling of small pores associated with the fine bead fraction i e a presented imaged section for the bead mixture sample used in the analysis shows an area of water associated with the fine bead fraction that encompasses roughly a third of the image area whereas pore water was observed to be homogeneously distributed in the uniform bead media sample images the presence of heterogeneously distributed water in the non uniform sample is not surprising in and of itself however it calls into question whether the a aw value estimated from this sampled image would be reproducible for another sampling at the same moisture condition and at the scale of measurement this issue also raises the question as to whether the sample scale for the xmt measurement meets the requirement of a rev for this non uniformly sized glass bead mixture complications related to the revs and xmt a aw calculations for non uniform media have been recently documented costanza robinson et al 2011 wang et al 2019 the increased slope of the ltm predicted a aw s w relationship is the result of the reduction in the Œ± parameter provided for this non uniform bead mixture c u 4 6 for the vg equation parameters vary systematically with the median particle size Œ± should decrease as the median particle size decreases and as the breadth of the particle size distribution increases and n should decrease as the breadth of the particle size distribution increases benson et al 2014 a aw values for the granusil sands predicted by the ltm again using Œ± and n values provided by the benson ptf were also overall larger than those for the xmt results for both the fine and coarse grained fractions and the mixture however the reason for the difference in a aw values in this case does not appear to be related to the heterogeneous pore water distribution issues observed for the glass bead mixture the pore water distribution in the xmt images presented by costanza robinson et al 2008 appears to be more uniform within the granusil sands in all cases here we interpret the differences between xmt and ltm estimates as being related to the granusil sands angularity roundness 0 2 sphericity 0 7 hamamoto et al 2016 and increased roughness of the particle surfaces as noted by costanza robinson et al 2008 the xmt method uses surface smoothing algorithms to minimize imaging artifacts as a part of estimating a aw values which removes micro scale surface topographic heterogeneity i e surface roughness of media particles xmt therefore provides smoothed surface estimates of a aw that compare well with gsa values conversely previous research has shown that particle surface roughness is captured in the results of media fluid retention curves dullien et al 1989 zheng et al 2015 with respect to the swrc the angularity of the granusil media allows greater packing density than for more rounded sands of the same particle size which results in an smaller pores and subsequently an increased air entry pressure for this media during drainage with a corresponding reduction in the vg Œ± parameter likewise an increased media surface roughness would also manifest in a reduced Œ± parameter the net effect of these media characteristics would then be an increased slope of the a aw s w relationship predicted by the ltm than would be measured by xmt as demonstrated in fig 1f given the agreement between measured data and the predicted swrcs shown in fig 1c the benton ptf appears to be providing vg parameters that are indirectly but appropriately accounting for the effects of the angularity and surface roughness of the granusil sands 3 4 comparing xmt and ltm predictions for natural sandy soils the majority of the existing literature data relating to estimating a aw for unsaturated porous media is limited to some model sands i e constructed using well sorted sand fractions and a few sandy soils i e the vinton and hayhook soils described previously relevant data collected for these sands are also presented in table 1 to our knowledge when this paper was prepared xmt measurement data had been only reported for the vinton soil brusseau et al 2006 the ltm was applied using vg parameters derived from the benson ptf published measured parameters and those derived from the rosetta model as described in section 2 2 for the rosetta model the textural classification of the vinton soil was 97 sand 1 8 silt 1 2 clay and œÅ d 1 46 costanza robinson 2001 peng and brusseau 2005 likewise the hayhook soil was classified as containing 86 sand 4 7 silt and 8 8 clay torrens et al 1998 with œÅ b 1 64 g cm 3 peng and brusseau 2005 the a aw s w relationships developed for the vinton and hayhook soils fig 2 demonstrate the dependence of the ltm prediction on the selection of Œ± and n provided by different parameter estimation methods selected note that for both soils the benson ptf predicts lower Œ± values table 1 which translates to a higher air entry pressure for the swrcs and increased a aw values than those predicted when using the other methods at the same s w fig 2 additionally the benson ptf provides values of n that are larger than those derived using the other methods in comparing the swrcs derived from the benson ptf and the measured vg parameters for these natural sandy soils the benson ptf appears to overestimate the moisture retention contribution of the fines fraction at higher s w as noted by benson et al 2014 the ptf was developed using sands for which the fine fraction i e particles 0 075 mm was removed therefore exclusion of the fines fraction appears to be weighting the effect of c u more heavily on the predicted value of Œ± than on the value of n when fines exist in the sample and for c u 2 to correct this the following simple modification to the benson ptf was made 9 n Œ± 0 99 c u 0 2 and 10 n n c u 2 2 0 0033 c u 0 279 applying these corrected equations the resulting values of Œ± for the vinton and hayhook soils drying curve become 0 026 cm 1 and 0 02 cm 1 respectively likewise the n values for these same soils become 3 53 and 2 91 respectively as shown in fig 2 using these corrected parameters results in swrcs and a aw s w relationships that closely match those derived from the measured vg parameters this is particularly the case for the hayhook soil where the fines fraction is more considerable while additional measured a aw s w relationships for natural soils would be needed to validate the corrections made here to the benson ptf these results indicate that it is possible that a simple correction to the ptf could render it more useful for estimating a aw s w relationships by the ltm for natural sandy soils containing fines this discussion highlights the importance of obtaining swrcs that are most representative of the vadose zone soils in question when using the ltm approach to derive a aw s w relationships it is additionally important to note that applying the ltm approach is not limited to using vg based models to characterize soil water retention characteristics other models including the brooks corey model e g oostrom et al 2001 can also be used 3 5 comparisons with aqueous tracer based methods in addition to the xmt methods air water interfacial adsorbing tracers have also been used to estimate a aw these have included both gas phase tracers gt and aqueous phase tracers at the gt methods have been shown to provide a aw values that are significantly greater than those provided by aqueous tracers with a aw approaching the area of the media determined by bet measurement as s w 0 peng and brusseau 2012 the xmt methods provide maximal a aw values that closely match the gsa for uniform media with smooth surface areas the fact that the a aw s w relationships provided by the ltm closely match those of the xmt methods for the uniform smooth and spherical media categories implies that the ltm is a good predictor of the interfacial area associated with natural pore water drainage and imbibition leverett 1941 kibbey and chen 2012 the at methods have also been shown to provide a aw values that were consistent with xmt results for smooth glass bead media e g el ouni et al 2021 indicating both methods are quantifying the same interfacial areas see e g fig 3 glass bead comparison however for some model sands and natural soils the at methods have provided a aw values that are greater than those measured by xmt with maximal values falling between those measured by the gt and xmt methods as demonstrated in fig 3 the xmt and ltm methods provide lower a aw values than the at methods for the accusand media and vinton soil the two at methods shown represent the results of both advecting aqueous tracer a at methods and those determined by mass balance mb methods schaefer et al 2000 araujo et al 2015 for the accusand 40 50 grade d 50 0 35 mm sand in all cases the a at data presented in fig 3 was derived from the published results of two separate experiments using different interfacial adsorbing tracers including one in which the pfas perfluorodecanoic acid pfda was used as a tracer and performed under different flow and input concentration conditions brusseau et al 2015 brusseau et al 2020 these a at experiments provide similar a aw s w relationships fig 3 however the extent to which these a at experiments can characterize a aw s w relationships is limited to the higher range of s w e g s w 0 5 given the difficulty in maintaining a steady and uniform flow condition at lower s w for these types of experiments the mb method results derived from the published results of schaefer et al 2000 generally exhibit the same linear trending a aw s w relationship for the accusand media as that provided by the a at results the mb method is considered a viable approach to quantifying a aw at lower s w conditions because it does not rely on flow but rather on the equilibrium distribution of tracer between the interface and other environmental compartments however the approach does result in more scatter in the a aw s w data brusseau 2020 noted that the scatter in the mb method is a potential limitation of the method the results provided by araujo et al 2015 also presented in fig 3 for the same accusand sand exhibit considerably more scatter in the data with a aw values that are considerably greater than those provided by schaefer et al 2000 while it might be tempting to plot a line through the cloud of datapoints this approach is not tenable given that this ignores the results of schaefer et al 2000 who used a similar approach and the same sand results similar to schaefer et al 2000 were reported by chen and kibbey 2006 for f110 ottawa sand undergoing multiple draining cycles using sodium octylbenzene sulfonate as a surface active tracer and an alternative measurement method the uncertainty in the mb measured a aw values for the vinton sand is even more significant as a result going forward we will rely on the a at dataset as a basis for comparing results the disparity between the xmt data and the a at a aw values has been attributed to the ability of the tracer to access the interfacial area associated with micro scale rough particle surfaces that is too small to be resolved by the xmt methods e g brusseau et al 2006 brusseau et al 2007 mcdonald et al 2016 that is the a at method is characterizing both a aw associated with capillary held pendular water and some additional fraction of the a aw associated with pore surface films of water that is impacted by the microscale roughness of the surface however the effect of surface roughness on the magnitude of the total a aw existing within an unsaturated porous media is a topic of continuing research and debate for example using stereoscopic scanning electron microscopy sem methods and surface configuration modeling kibbey 2013 demonstrated that surface associated water remains held to the surface via capillary tension which results in a significantly smoother air water interfacial surface than that of the underlying solid surface as a result the impact of surface roughness on the a aw was shown to be greatly minimized during drainage for capillary pressure heads less than 100 cm a capillary pressure head of 100 cm or less would be needed to drain most of the media included in this evaluation to residual saturation including the vinton soil this would suggest that these same media should present a smooth air water interface for these surfaces under normal drainage with the magnitude of a aw associated with these wetted surfaces being well characterized by the xmt methods further if water associated with surface roughness is held by capillarity the presence of this water should be represented in the swrc as demonstrated in the literature e g dullien et al 1989 zheng et al 2015 therefore the ltm a aw s w relationship predictions should be additionally representative this was also the position of kibbey and chen 2012 who contend that the ltm provides the maximum possible area formed during natural drainage the utility of the a at method to characterize interfacial areas was further challenged by kibbey and chen 2012 who used pore network modeling to demonstrate that neither diffusion nor head driven flow was sufficient to allow access to surface films i e those presumed to be associated with the increased a aw for a at these authors also suggested that in the absence of additional experimental artifacts surface charge or surface tension gradient driven advection would be needed for surface active tracers to access these surface films this possibility was examined by costanza robinson and henry 2017 who performed a numerical modeling study to demonstrate the impact of surface tension induced flow potentially providing artificially enhanced a aw values determined by the a at methods however given the reported reproducibility of the a at results for experiments using different tracers at different concentrations brusseau et al 2015 brusseau et al 2020 and the recent method validity evaluation provided by el ouni et al 2021 who demonstrated that bulk surface tension induced flow and other potential experimental artifacts were not relevant it is difficult to ignore the a at measurements in their modeling evaluation kibbey and chen 2012 did not include the effects of microscopic surface roughness an omission that was thereafter addressed by jiang et al 2019 who showed that including surface roughness resulted in the same monotonic increases in a aw values at high to moderate s w values and exponentially increasing a aw values at low s w as observed by the gt methods however while jiang et al 2019 demonstrate that these higher a aw values could be caused by surface roughness at lower s w and that the resulting a aw s w relationships can be made to match measured data they did not extend this evaluation to include a reason as to how these surface active tracers would contact this additional surface roughness associated interfacial area during aqueous transport under an assumed uniform and constant soil moisture condition kibbey 2013 demonstrated a thicker layer of water associated with rough surfaces and suggested that diffusion of solutes within this thicker capillary held surface associated water may be possible wherein diffusive rates may increase by roughly two orders of magnitude due to the resulting larger cross sectional areas for diffusion this diffusive mechanism could in turn allow surface active tracers to contact a larger portion of the total interfacial area thus yielding larger at measured a aw values than would be the case for a smooth surfaced media diffusion of solutes into and out of these thickened surface associated water films could have contributed to the rate limited diffusional mass transfer characterized in the column experiments presented by brusseau 2020 for the water unsaturated transport of non reactive and surface active solutes between advective and non advective domains therefore it is possible that this thickened film diffusive mass transfer could be contributing to the disparity between the a aw values provided by the a at and ltm alternatively and despite the convincing discussions provided by el ouni et al 2021 and brusseau et al 2020 it seems likely that a surface active tracer adsorbing to an air water interface would impact the magnitude of the interfacial area it is accesing for measurement the a at method is physically a chromatographic technique that assumes that the stationary phase i e the air water interface in this case has a constant area spatially and temporally during the test while this can be reliably assumed to be the case for solid adsorbent media fluid fluid interfacial areas are generally not as stable in the context of the previous discussion perturbations in the surface charge or surface pressure tension of the air water interface due to interfacial adsorption even at a very low concentration could still disrupt cohesive forces between water molecules at the interface enough to modify the configuration of water films associated with rough surfaces these perturbations might not be significant enough to drain interparticle pendular water but could cause a localized displacement of water films or deformation of water film surfaces that could manifest as a localized increase in a aw as the pulse of the surface active tracer moves through the porous medium for the a at method this increased interfacial area would increase tracer retention and ultimately provide a larger measured a aw value than would be predicted by the ltm at the same s w it is unlikely that this type of film water displacement would be observable at the column or continuum scale in this context the a at method would then provide an effective a aw for these amphiphilic surface active tracers and not necessarily the true a aw for the unsaturated medium which has been reported to be provided by the ltm kibbey and chen 2012 as shown in fig 3 when the surface roughness is absent both the a at and ltm methods predict the same a aw s w relationship which strengthens the argument that surface roughness is a key factor in the a at results 3 6 modifying the ltm to include tracer accessible area while the causal mechanisms are not fully understood the experimental results presented in the literature suggest that aqueous interfacial tracers are measuring higher a aw values than those predicted by the ltm and the discrepancy appears to be related to changes in the degree of surface roughness of the porous media see fig 3 table 1 this is not necessarily problematic for pfas because these chemicals like the tracers used for the a at method are also surface active and amphiphilic therefore a aw s w relationships that are representative of surface active solutes are needed for predicting the retention contribution of air water interfacial adsorption during transport what is problematic is that continuum models like the ltm do not account for the observed effects of surface active solutes and surface roughness the following modification to the ltm is proposed to correct this discrepancy the modification applies a direct surface roughness multiplier srm to the a aw s w relationship provided by the ltm recall eq 1 this simple approach allows the ltm prediction to continue to include the effects of particle size uniformity and differences in packing density as it relates to particle angularity as governed by the swrc for capillary water while also capturing the contributive effects of surface roughness on the magnitude of a aw at a given moisture condition using the a at data as the benchmark a aw s w relationship in this application the srm values needed to match the a at a aw s w relationship for the accusand and vinton soil examples are 2 4 and 3 3 respectively the results of applying the srm to the accusand and vinton soil a aw s w relationships are also presented in fig 3 note that the srm adjusted ltm result for the accusand media maintains a more linear trending a aw s w relationship with decreasing s w owing to the particle size uniformity of the model sand this result is consistent with the mb tracer results of schaefer et al 2000 the sphericity and uniformity of the sand and the low soil surface roughness factor srf calculated for this sand i e srf 18 for the medium accusand as in table 1 in contrast the srm adjusted ltm result for the natural vinton soil exhibits a more distinct non linearly increasing a aw s w relationship with decreasing s w consistent with the increased fines fraction less uniform particle size distribution and factor of 18 6 increase in the srf for this soil as compared to the model sand it is important also to note that this approach does not attempt to characterize the significantly increased a aw values observed by the gt results at lower s w in keeping with the limitations of the ltm leverett 1941 bradford and leij 1997 the low s w endpoint of the srm adjusted a aw s w relationships are truncated at the residual saturation for a given porous media which is appropriate for unsaturated transport under aqueous advection i e advective flow is not expected when water content is below residual saturation to guide the selection of srm values for other natural soils a soil surface roughness factor srf initially proposed by wenzel 1936 and applied more recently by others when evaluating a aw s w relationships e g brusseau et al 2007 costanza robinson et al 2008 jiang et al 2019 was used as additionally described in table 1 the srf is redefined here as 11 srf n 2 bet area gsa where gsa is the smooth geometric surface of the soil calculated using eq 4 properties for 21 arizona soils were collected from the literature i e arthur et al 2012 ghanbarian et al 2021 this data is provided in table 2 in addition to the srf ghanbarian et al 2021 provided measured soil surface fractal dimensions d s for each of these same soils from water retention curves that were used to additionally characterize soil surface roughness d s is an index of the topographical complexity of soil surfaces as it relates to scale and characterizes the change in surface roughness between soil textural classifications as these d s values were derived from water retention data they are representative of the degree of surface roughness at the continuum scale in keeping with the ltm predictions the three dimensional d s values vary between 2 and 3 pfeifer et al 1983 wang et al 2005 a value of 2 indicates a smooth surface and a value of 3 corresponds to an extremely rough soil particle surface as observed in table 2 d s values generally increase with increasing clay content d s values ranging between 2 09 and 2 3 have been documented for model sands similar to those described in table 1 avnir et al 1985 yang et al 2016 the d s values were used to approximate the rate of change of surface roughness for these soils relative to their corresponding srf values as shown in fig 4a this slope was then used in concert with the srfs and srms determined for the accusand and vinton soil to provide data with which to develop an empirical model to estimate srm values for soils of varied texture a langmuir like equation was used to fit the accusand and vinton data and the slope of the d s srf relationship was used to scale the extrapolation of the model with increasing srf the results of this work are presented in fig 4b note that the proposed srm srf model is scaled such that srm 1 when srf 1 which defines a smooth surface condition consistent with the a aw s w results for the glass bead case shown in fig 3 additionally in keeping with the trend provided by the d s srf relationship srm values do not exceed a value of 3 5 as srf values increase unfortunately no additional a aw s w data for natural soils was found in the published literature precluding further validation of the proposed srf srm model this lack of a aw s w relationship data presents a significant data gap for this area of research and is problematic with respect to assessing the fate and transport of surface active contaminants like pfas as there is a growing need to model pfas transport in vadose zones comprised of soils of varied textural classification strictly the srf srm model would be most applicable to sands and predominantly sandy soils similar to those described herein on the other hand for soils with broad particle size distributions e g loams and clayey soils it is possible that the effects of surface roughness on the a aw s w relationship could be overwhelmed by the contributions of interparticle capillary effects obviating the need for correcting the ltm prediction therefore more research is needed to determine the importance of surface rougness on a aw values for a wider variety of natural soils and sediments particularly with respect to supporting site scale modeling however the proposed srf srm model provides a practical first approximation method that incorporates the effects of surface roughness on a aw estimates provided by the ltm where the srm can be estimated from common soil textural classification measurements i e the bet specific surface area of the soil sample and the median particle size or d 50 examples of ltm predicted a aw s w relationships are compared in fig 5 to their corresponding srm corrected relationships for a few sandy soils and a loam selected from table 2 textural data from table 2 was used as input to the rosetta model described previously to provide vg parameters and generate swrcs that were then used to generate ltm predictions texturally the sand and loamy sand results are most consistent with the vinton soil and the hayhook soil as are the predicted a aw s w relationships regarding the loamy sand predictions the srm adjusted a aw s w relationship closely matches that of the srm adjusted sand results until s w 0 5 a aw values increase considerably thereafter representing the effect of surface roughness on the magnitude of the a aw with increased pore water drainage at the continuum scale as the fines content of the soil increase predicted a aw values increase for the sandy loam and loam soils predicted a aw values are roughly a factor of 10 greater than those of the sand and loamy sand as s w falls below 0 2 in these cases it is important to consider that field capacities for a typical sandy loam and loam soil range between Œ∏ 0 18 0 28 and Œ∏ 0 25 0 32 respectively or s w 0 47 0 73 and s w 0 6 0 76 respectively under typical field conditions these soils should retain enough moisture to limit the magnitude of the a aw and the contribution of awi adsorption during pfas transport however this would not necessarily hold true for soils positioned at the ground surface in an arid environment where much lower water saturations could be achieved via evaporative losses where a aw values could be large and pfas could be significantly retained within the shallow vadose zone as a result 3 7 the significance of the a aw s w relationship on transport the potential effect of this a aw variability on pfas retardation factors r is demonstrated for pfos a representative pfas and is presented in fig 6 r values were calculated using the following equation 12 r 1 œÅ b k d Œ∏ k aw a aw Œ∏ where œÅ b is the soil bulk density m l3 k d is the solid phase sorption coefficient l3 m1 k aw is the air water adsorption coefficient l and Œ∏ s w n as presented eq 12 assumes linear solid phase sorption and that sorption and air water interfacial adsorption are the only sources of retention sorption coefficients k d were 0 16 and 1 2 cm3 g for the accusand and vinton soil respectively and were derived from the linear model fit to the data presented by van glubt et al 2021 for solute concentrations 1 mg l other parameters used in these calculations were œÅ b 1 5 g cm3 and k aw 0 026 cm the results of these calculations fig 6 demonstrate not only the variability in pfos retention but also the importance of using the appropriate a aw s w relationship when surface active solutes are being considered because vadose zone pfas retention could be greatly misrepresented finally it is important to note that all a aw s w relationships used in this work were derived from data representing drainage conditions the magnitude of a aw values in the vadose zone will be impacted by transient cycles of drainage and imbibition wetting during natural infiltration events while leverett 1941 demonstrates the ltm could be applied to both drainage and imbibition conditions characterized by separate swrcs and potentially providing different a aw s w relationships for each condition the validity of this application with respect to the transport of pfas has not been using a at methods and the vinton soil brusseau et al 2007 observed that a aw s w relationships measured under both drainage and imbibition conditions were similar and cited the importance of surface roughness associated water films for the similarity in measured a aw values schaefer et al 2000 also observed similar a aw s w relationships under drainage and imbibition conditions using mb methods however both studies utilized a surface active tracer i e sodium dodecyl benzenesulfonate at concentrations that would promote interfacial tension reduction and could have altered the moisture retention characteristics that would have been observed for water without surfactant therefore additional research is needed on this topic 4 conclusions when performing calculations or numerical simulations of the fate and transport of pfas and other surface active solutes in the vadose zone and accurate a aw s w relationship is needed most research has focused on accurate characterization of interfacial adsorption coefficients and the associated concentration dependence however capturing changes in the a aw s w relationship relationship that result from changes in soil texture is equally important indeed accurate determination of the a aw s w relationship is arguably more important when one considers the challenges in characterizing heterogeneity at both the pore and continuum scale and its relationship to the swrc and a aw s w relationship in this work the well known ltm model is compared to two methods for the determination of the a aw s w relationship microtomography and aqueous tracer methods the ltm model is favored here due to its simplicity and because it represents the change in the magnitude of the a aw with changes in s w at the continuum scale consistent with practical methods used to model pfas transport i e continuum mechanics behind the swrc and the application of the richards equation for unsaturated flow in addition the ltm method is less time consuming and expensive yet appropriately captures the effects of soil particle size uniformity in the particle size distribution and differences in packing density on the a aw s w relationship the xmt the a at method and the ltm were found to provide very similar a aw s w relationships when the porous media surface is smooth i e glass beads suggesting each method characterizes the same effective interfacial area in these cases however both the ltm and a at methods provide larger a aw values than measured by the xmt method for non uniform increasingly angular media or when the surfaces of the media become rougher as characterized by the proposed srf the a at method was shown to provide a aw values that are consistently greater than both the xmt and ltm results for a given s w with the degree of difference increasing with increased surface roughness consistent with the conclusions drawn from literature sources wherein much of the a at data was obtained the a at method utilizes surface active solutes as tracers to characterize a aw at the continuum scale in porous media columns these tracers appear to be sampling portions of the air water interface that are not represented by either the ltm prediction or xlm measurements while the exact mechanism for this disparity is uncertain it appears that the degree of microscale surface roughness is a dominant contributing factor because the at method uses tracers that are surface active and the contaminants of interest in this work are also surface active it is reasonable to conclude the tracers themselves may influence the interfacial area thus the a at data provides the most representative a aw values for surface active solutes like pfas in addition the ltm and similar thermodynamic methods likely provide a true measure of the a aw under natural drainage conditions a conclusion based on the presentations of kibbey and chen 2012 and kibbey 2013 and on the similarity in predicted a aw s w relationships when media surfaces are smooth using the literature derived a at measured a aw s w relationships as a benchmark for surface active tracers the ltm prediction was modified to include the effects of surface roughness on the predicted a aw s w relationship by applying a direct multiplier to the ltm prediction to account for surface roughness i e the srm an empirical model was developed using the measured data to estimate the magnitude of the srm with changes in calculated srf values as soil textural classifications change because this empirical model was developed from a limited dataset it should be considered to provide only first order estimates additional measured a aw s w relationships for a wider variety of soil textures are needed for a more robust test of this empirical model however in the absence of this additional data the approach provides a practical method for calculating or simulating pfas mass transport in the vadose zone and accounting for the effects of surface roughness on a aw s w relationships finally because the representativeness of the a aw s w relationships predicted by the ltm depends on the representativeness of the swrc used methods of estimating vg parameters that define the swrcs were compared the accuracy of the rosetta model was found to improve when fines e g particles 0 0075 mm are present in the soil for non uniform sandy soils without fines the benson ptf which corrects predictions for changes in the uniformity of porous media particles was shown to best match measured swrcs for the sands presented in this work the benson ptf was also modified to account for the presence of fines which greatly improved the accuracy of the a aw s w relationship prediction for the natural soils used in this work compared to that derived from the measured swrcs however as with all ptfs including the rosetta model it is important to understand the operational limitations of these models to ensure representative prediction of hydraulic properties credit authorship contribution statement jeff a k silva conceptualization methodology validation formal analysis

1322,groundwater fate and transport modeling results demonstrate that matrix diffusion plays a role in attenuating the expansion of groundwater plumes of non degrading or highly recalcitrant compounds this is especially significant for systems where preferred destructive attenuation processes such as biological and abiotic degradation are weak or ineffective for plume control under these conditions models of nondestructive physical attenuation processes traditionally dispersion or sorption do not demonstrate sufficient plume control unless matrix diffusion is considered matrix diffusion has been shown to be a notable emergent impact of geological heterogeneity typically associated with back diffusion and extending remediation timeframes through concentration tailing of the trailing edge of a plume however less attention has been placed on evaluating how matrix diffusion can serve as an attenuation mechanism for the leading edge of a plume of non degrading compounds like perfluoroalkyl acids pfaas including perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos in this study the remchlor md model was parametrically applied to a generic unconsolidated and heterogeneous geologic site with a constant pfos source and no degradation of pfos in the downgradient edge of the plume low levels of mechanical dispersion and retardation were used in the model for three different geologic heterogeneity cases ranging from no matrix diffusion e g sand only to considerable matrix diffusion using low permeability low k layers lenses and or aquitards our analysis shows that in theory many non degrading plumes may expand for significant time periods before dispersion alone would eventually stabilize the plume however matrix diffusion can significantly slow the rate and degree of this migration for one 100 year travel time scenario consideration of matrix diffusion results in a simulated pfos plume length that is over 80 shorter than the plume length simulated without matrix diffusion although many non degrading plumes may continue to slowly expand over time matrix diffusion resulted in lower concentrations and smaller plume footprints modeling multiple hydrogeologic settings showed that the effect of matrix diffusion is more significant in transmissive zones containing multiple low k lenses layers than transmissive zones underlain and overlain by low k aquitards this study found that at sites with significant matrix diffusion groundwater plumes will be shorter will expand more slowly and may be amenable to a physical retention based monitored natural attenuation mna paradigm in this case a small plume assimilative capacity zone in front of the existing plume could be reserved for slow de minimus future expansion of a non degrading plume if potential receptors are protected in this scenario then this approach is similar to allowances for expanding plumes under some existing environmental regulatory programs accounting for matrix diffusion may support new strategic approaches and alternative paradigms for remediation even for sites and conditions with non degrading constituents such as pfaas metals metalloids and radionuclides keywords pfas monitored natural attenuation matrix diffusion low permeability non degradable modeling 1 introduction chemical diffusion in and out of low permeability low k geologic media is now recognized as an important groundwater fate and transport process e g fetter et al 1999 chapman and parker 2005 national research council 2005 2013 sale et al 2013 hadley and newell 2014 this matrix diffusion process is caused by heterogeneous aquifer architectures where groundwater constituents flowing through transmissive media will diffuse into semi stagnant low k media these low k media zones can be either continuous or discontinuous and are comprised of both connected and disconnected pore spaces this geologic heterogeneity and attendant matrix diffusion is one of the most prevalent hydrogeologic conditions found at hazardous waste sites national research council 2005 therefore the presence of this heterogeneity should be considered a default assumption when working at groundwater cleanup sites payne et al 2008 matrix diffusion is commonly defined as the migration of dissolved solutes from flowing macropores or fractures into the more or less stagnant pores of adjacent rock matrix winterle 1998 fig 1 shows a commonly used illustration to explain matrix diffusion a groundwater constituent plume travels through the underlying layer top panel of fig 1 and diffuses into the low k zones silt and clay above and below the transmissive sand middle panel once plume constituent concentrations in the transmissive zone fall due to source attenuation source remediation or plume remediation back diffusion occurs from the low k zones and can sustain a weaker plume in the transmissive sand for longer periods of time bottom panel most of the matrix diffusion research to date has focused on the time it takes natural processes or remediation projects to remediate groundwater plumes subject to the back diffusion processes shown in the bottom panel of fig 1 chapman and parker 2005 lipson et al 2005 sale et al 2013 national research council 2013 tatti et al 2018 2019 brooks et al 2021 borden and cha 2021 visualizations and imaging have been particularly important to explain the challenges associated with back diffusions two important contributions are doner and sale 2010 and tatti et al 2016 in this paper we evaluate the impacts of matrix diffusion along the leading edge of the plume during the time of expansion top panel in fig 1 a condition that can be of critical importance at some sites with recalcitrant groundwater constituents while this has been investigated before at a specific fractured rock site e g lipson et al 2005 this paper uses a novel application of a relatively new groundwater model remchlor md to explore the key factors and heterogeneity geometries that impact the amount of matrix diffusion related attenuation in unconsolidated hydrogeologic settings this work may be particularly important to an emerging class of groundwater constituents per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas many of which do not appear to be degrading in groundwater under natural conditions at this time although monitored natural attenuation mna is often thought of as requiring destructive processes to control groundwater plumes non destructive processes such as immobilization via sorption can also be used for mna usepa 2007 as stated by the national academies of sciences engineering and medicine 2020 matrix diffusion can be considered a natural attenuation process because it attenuates the rate at which contaminants migrate in the forward direction and it attenuates the contaminant discharge into the mobile fluid in the reverse direction matrix diffusion has been the intense focus of recent research efforts at older sites however the primary emphasis has been on the mass retained in low k units acting as a low level persistent source of constituents to moving groundwater rather than on low k units acting as sinks or as storage reservoirs that retard constituent migration during the plume expansion phase this attenuation during plume expansion has been demonstrated by historical laboratory studies of plume fate and transport from the 1980s gillham et al 1984 sudicky et al 1985 in fig 2 an experimental apparatus a column on its side was constructed to observe the breakthrough curve for a chloride tracer sudicky et al 1985 with no matrix diffusion numerical modeling showed the red breakthrough curve would have occurred but actual data from the column experiments showed a much retarded attenuated breakthrough curve blue line the authors commented the experimental results show a delay in the breakthrough of the tracer in the effluent of the permeable sand layer along with a substantial decrease in concentration after a 1 m travel distance in a related 1984 paper gillham et al expanded on this finding stating a second consequence of the solute storage effect offered by transverse diffusion into low permeability layers is a rate of migration of the frontal portion of a contaminant in the permeable layers that is less than the groundwater velocity while these experiments were performed at the very beginning of the groundwater transport boom that occurred from 1975 to 2005 schwartz et al 2019 subsequent developments showed that many of the key groundwater constituents were controlled to some degree by biodegradation and that many groundwater plumes were shrinking or stable in two multiple site studies of several hundred hydrocarbon sites over 90 of the groundwater plumes were found to be either stable shrinking or exhausted low concentration stable plumes largely due to the rapid biodegradation of dissolved constituents in these plumes newell and connor 1998 wiedemeier et al 1998 connor et al 2014 one study of chlorinated solvent plumes being considered for mna showed that only 9 of the plumes were expanding mcguire et al 2004 demonstrating that biodegradation is occurring is a key focus of most mna protocols for organic groundwater constituents e g wiedemeier et al 1995 1998 due to the delay in time between initial release and initiation of remediation activities at many sites with conventional degrading compounds by the time site characterization began the active period of groundwater plume growth had already occurred and the plumes had already stabilized or were in a state of declining growth this state allowed for many to be controlled by remediation projects that addressed stable or near stable transport conditions therefore site managers and consultants may not have encountered as many expanding plumes making early stage attenuation more difficult to conceptualize and quantify a few studies have focused on the direct mechanical attenuation effects from matrix diffusion lipson et al 2005 modeled a fractured rock aquifer using a relatively simple geometry comprised of a parallel plate discrete fracture solute transport model dfm the model showed that the plume migration rate into a fractured sandstone rock aquifer can be much lower than the groundwater seepage velocity because of matrix diffusion effects when applying their model to an actual field site the authors found that there was 800 time more mass of the non degrading solute chloride in the sandstone matrix compared to the chloride mass in the fractures at steady state conditions currently there is an emerging class of groundwater constituents pfas that are different than conventional groundwater constituents such as hydrocarbons methyl tert butyl ether mtbe and chlorinated solvents in several ways newell et al 2020 while some pfas can degrade partially under naturally occurring conditions this degradation step appears to terminate when the compound becomes fully fluorinated as a perfluoroalkyl acid pfaa forming a highly stable molecule in the environment at present there are no practical groundwater remediation technologies that have been shown to destroy pfaa plumes in situ simon et al 2019 greatly limiting pfas site management options therefore many pfas groundwater sites requiring plume management rely on groundwater pump and treat technology a costly and inefficient approach from which the remediation industry has spent the last few decades backing away simon et al 2019 pfas is a particular example of highly recalcitrant compounds but there are other metals metalloids e g chromate or pertechnetate in oxic systems and long lived radionuclides e g radioiodine that have minimal degradation potential because of different fate and transport characteristics understanding how matrix diffusion might attenuate the growth of pfas plumes could be important for managing these plumes adamson et al 2020 potentially using retention based mna newell et al 2021a 2021b newell et al 2021a describes how expanding plumes might be managed with a plume assimilative capacity zone similar to plume management zones pmzs that allow some level of plume expansion in some existing groundwater regulatory programs 2 methods 2 1 matrix diffusion modeling methodology despite the recognized importance of matrix diffusion the current state of practice in 2021 for groundwater modeling is to use an advection dispersion model often including sorption and degradation processes to simulate groundwater plume migration hadley and newell 2014 however almost all of today s commonly used analytical groundwater models such as bioscreen newell et al 1996 and biochlor aziz et al 2000 do not explicitly model matrix diffusion in addition simulating matrix diffusion in common field scale applications with finite differences models such as mt3d or modpath can lead to inaccurate results when applied to field sites unless unusually fine discretization is used chapman et al 2012 farhat et al 2020 dual porosity mass transfer models have been used to simulate the matrix diffusion caused by embedded heterogeneity however this method requires a mass transfer coefficient that cannot be easily estimated from field data such as boring logs that describe geologic heterogeneity this coefficient also tends to be time dependent meaning that a mass transfer coefficient that works well to match short term data but may not work well for long term data and vice versa as an alternative technique the semi analytic method developed by muskus and falta 2018 is a more general and overall more accurate method for modeling matrix diffusion 2 2 the remchlor md matrix diffusion model more recently a key tool for understanding and demonstrating the effect of matrix diffusion on attenuation has emerged estcp s remchlor md model falta et al 2018 farhat et al 2018 muskus and falta 2018 estcp s remchlor md was developed to properly account for heterogeneity and matrix diffusion in groundwater transport models in its essence remchlor md is a semi analytical model for source behavior and plume response but more importantly it is capable of implementing matrix diffusion within the algorithm the model assumes 1 dimensional groundwater flow and 3 dimensional dispersion over a 3 dimensional array of defined gridblocks the transport code written in fortran falta et al 2018 was incorporated into a graphical user interface developed using the microsoft excel spreadsheet platform farhat et al 2018 the remchlor md source term uses a power law approach to simulate the relationship between mass discharge leaving the source and the remaining mass in the source the plume model uses a numerical semi analytical solution for advection dispersion sorption and biodegradation of parent daughter compounds that accounts for matrix diffusion into and back out of e g back diffusion low k zones the model specifically models the diffusion into low k geologic media the time it is stored within these media and then the rate of back diffusion over time by using this powerful model researchers and practitioners can simulate the complex interaction of a wide variety of factors such as changes in the source strength over time due to natural depletion of source mass or by source remediation falta et al 2005 changes in the decay rates high k and low k zones in the plume for parent and daughter compounds in time and space such as the impact of plume remediation projects and different geometries of matrix diffusion aquitards overlying or underlying a transmissive zone and or embedded layers lenses within the transmissive zone the governing partial differential equations for transient matrix diffusion assuming first order decay of a component m 1 that produces a daughter compound m are shown in equations 1 and 2 muskus and falta 2018 1 r lm c lm t œÑ l d 2 c lm z l 2 Œª lm c lm m 1 2 r lm c lm t œÑ l d 2 c lm z l 2 y lm 1 Œª lm 1 c lm 1 Œª lm c lm m 1 where

remchlor md numerical formulation can be found in muskus and falta 2018 2 3 how remchlor md accounts for geologic heterogeneity in the remchlor md model users enter geologic heterogeneity data via the heterogeneity calculator portion of the graphical user interface in this part of the interface users enter geologic data to allow two independent calculations to simulate matrix diffusion in aquifers impact of low k aquitards the user describes if the aquifer being modeled has any low k aquitards on the top bottom or both top and bottom fig s1 an unconfined aquifer overlying a low k unit such as a clay layer would be represented with the second of the four panels the third panel representing a low k aquitard on the top of the transmissive zone behaves identically to the aquitard on bottom configuration the fourth panel has both top and bottom aquitards the first panel represents a system with no aquitards such as a thick continuous sand unit with the plume only residing in the top or middle of the formation the model assumes infinitely thick aquitards that serve first as a sink then a source of groundwater constituents to the transmissive zone over time impact of embedded low k layers lenses between the top and bottom of the plume the remchlor md model can simulate the matrix diffusion effects from different densities and geometries of embedded low k layers lenses between the top and bottom of the plume fig s2 the model uses three geometrical heterogeneity parameters developed by muskus and falta 2018 to define matrix diffusion in the layers lenses within the transmissive zone 1 transmissive zone volume fraction which is equal to one minus the low k volume fraction vf 2 average diffusion length l half of the average thickness of embedded low k layers lenses and 3 surface area of low k interfaces amd within a gridblock knowledge of the first two of these three factors can be used to calculate the third factor the surface area of low k interfaces using a volume balance on the low k material muskus and falta 2018 the total volume vi of a gridblock and eq 6 6 v i 1 v f a md l as shown in fig s2 users modeling unconsolidated sites can select a generic configuration of the transmissive zone volume fraction one of the five panels shown ranging from 0 to 80 low k material and then add an average diffusion length e g average thickness of the embedded layers lenses alternatively users can directly enter site specific geologic data from up to 100 geologic boring logs and the interface will estimate the three heterogeneity parameters the model can also be used to simulate matrix diffusion in fractured rock assuming a parallel fracture network the definition of the site specific low k material is important when modeling matrix diffusion in remchlor md as there are several different definitions of what comprises low k material in the literature brooks et al 2021 described the features of a low permeable zone lpz with a 10 5 cm s threshold citing walden 1997 and a 10 4 cm s limit from horst et al 2019 others have used hydraulic conductivity contrasts where a transmissive zone in contact with a low k zone has a hydraulic conductivity of 100 higher than the adjacent low k zone dr beth parker cited in farhat et al 2018 sale et al 2013 combine diffusion and slow advection when conceptualizing fate and transport in heterogeneous porous media which indicates that relatively low hydraulic conductivity ratios may be sufficient for defining low k units in remchlor md payne 2016 showed the contact between a sandy transmissive zone with 1 5 low k silt and a second sandy zone with only moderately higher content of low k silt or finer materials 7 17 would result in significantly higher diffusive mass storage making the second siltier sand zone act like a low k unit even though the stratum is predominately sand with regard to the transmissive zone volume fraction an empirical study of 141 boring logs from 43 sites in california indicated that the more permeable 30 of the aquifer cross section carried 90 of the groundwater flow kulkarni et al 2020 fig 3 this dataset suggests that a typical plume in this study was in a hydrogeologic setting where roughly 70 of geologic media served as a low k unit for the purposes of quantifying potential matrix diffusion effects in remchlor md users enter the hydraulic conductivity of the predominant transmissive soils in the plume typically sands or gravels which does not include the permeability of the low k layers or lenses this value called the transmissive zone groundwater darcy velocity is then reduced in the model by multiplying by the transmissive zone volume fraction to yield an average darcy velocity for the aquifer cross section farhat et al 2018 with these elements users can define geologic heterogeneity to account for matrix diffusion in unconsolidated aquifers based on the method developed by falta and wang 2017 and muskus and falta 2018 note that a separate calculation is performed in the remchlor md interface if users are simulating fractured rock this method is not addressed in this paper however the resulting conclusions of this paper are expected to be similar or even stronger for high matrix porosity media based on the results of lipson et al 2005 2 4 fate and transport modeling of pfos for this study remchlor md was used to model a hypothetical non degrading compound with source concentration and linear sorption data similar to a perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos plume pfos is one of the most environmentally important pfas due its mobility and low regulatory criteria e g newell et al 2020 while there are uncertainties associated with pfas fate and transport e g simon et al 2019 key processes in the saturated zone during plume expansion are understood well enough to perform screening level modeling of pfos migration as described below advection no differences with other groundwater constituents mechanical dispersion no known differences with other groundwater constituents matrix diffusion pfos matrix diffusion has been verified to occur at field sites e g adamson et al 2021 sorption pfos sorption is complex with partitioning to air water interfaces and non aqueous phase liquids napls brusseau 2018 as well as sorption via electrostatic hydrophobic and ion exchange mechanisms zhang et al 2019 desorption can show significant hysteresis brusseau et al 2019 sima and jaff√© 2021 however for modeling plume expansion constant source sorption only no desorption in the saturated zone plume no air water partitioning no napl in the plume a linear sorption isotherm model may capture most of the sorption processes a generic equilibrium based sorption model based on a dual equilibrium desorption process assumes that sorption processes are linear while desorption can result in significant hysteresis kan et al 1998 chen et al 2002 sima and jaff√© 2021 state however at low pfas concentrations a linear k d may be sufficient depending on soil pfas solvent interactions which for pfos was less than 100 350 Œºg l the 75th percentile pfos source zone concentration of 1600 pfas source zones compiled by anderson 2019 was 2 8 Œºg l newell et al 2020 which is significantly less than the 100 to 350 Œºg l threshold identified by sima and jaff√© 2021 consequently the linear kd assumption may be appropriate for most plumes furthermore because only pfos plume expansion is being evaluated in this paper the linear sorption model in remchlor md is likely to be an adequate representation of actual pfos sorption in groundwater biodegradation pfaas like pfos have not been shown to degrade under ambient environmental conditions naidu et al 2020 itrc 2021 therefore no degradation was simulated pfas is comprised of thousands of different compounds with widely different behaviors so the results of the pfos modeling cannot be directly transferred to other pfas overall the modeling exercise assumed a saturated zone only pfos plume with no non aqueous phase liquids but with matrix diffusion impacts similar to the one at the site characterized by adamson et al 2020 and nickerson et al 2021 however the degree of matrix diffusion was varied to explore the impact of heterogeneity on plume expansion 2 5 modeling impact of geologic heterogeneity on plume expansion to estimate the impacts of diffusion each model domain was divided into four layers each 2 5 m thick and extended 2500 m in the direction of groundwater flow through an unconsolidated formation each model assumed no remediation of the source or plume and allowed plumes to move throughout the flow system from a constant source zone for a period of 100 years first three different levels of geologic boundary conditions were compared for this study case 1 no aquitards only the transmissive media were used in the model this case assumed there were no aquitards with low k zones overlying or underlying the transmissive zone that could serve as a sink for groundwater constituents during plume expansion case 2 bottom aquitard this case assumed that the transmissive zone was underlain by an aquitard case 3 top and bottom aquitards this case assumed that the transmissive zone was bracketed by both underlying and overlying aquitards second geologic heterogeneity from low k layers lenses within the transmissive zone was then added in step 2 below for each case reductions in plume lengths after source release were determined as follows step 1 plume lengths were determined without matrix diffusion being explicitly modeled this scenario would be akin to a traditional modeling solution a concentration of 2 8 Œºg l was used for the source concentration in the model as a base case groundwater seepage velocities calculated from 290 groundwater sites newell et al 1990 were used to develop moderate low and high range seepage velocities for the modeling other input data are described in table 1 the plume boundary was defined as being 0 070 Œºg l the u s environmental protection agency usepa preliminary remediation goal for pfos pfoa usepa 2019 step 2 each model was re run with matrix diffusion explicitly incorporated with different combinations of aquitards and layers lenses assuming matrix diffusion was occurring at the site plume lengths were estimated for scenarios with increasing percentage of relatively thin low k lenses layers e g sandy clays sandy silts silts clays see fig s2 embedded within the transmissive zone i e between an assumed no flow boundary such as the water table or between aquitards see fig s1 for each group of scenarios the no matrix diffusion and matrix diffusion cases were assumed to have the same groundwater seepage velocities for simplicity and because of the various configurations in the different cases e g presence of top bottom or both aquitards etc the average concentration over the full saturated thickness was used to establish the plume length specifically plume lengths were estimated assuming these scenarios for embedded low k units scenario 1 there were no low k lenses layers embedded in the transmissive zone scenario 2 20 of the transmissive zone contained embedded low k lenses layers scenario 3 40 of the transmissive zone was embedded with low k lenses layers scenario 4 60 of the transmissive zone contained embedded low k lenses layers and scenario 5 80 of the transmissive zone was embedded with low k lenses layers the scenarios with 40 to 60 of the transmissive zone embedded with low k lenses layers approximate the middle range value of the 42 actual groundwater sites in california that were analyzed by kulkarni et al 2020 to determine groundwater flow vs cumulative area relationships for the initial case shown in table 1 the average low k layer thickness was assumed to be 0 5 m thick based on results from kulkarni et al 2020 this corresponds to an average diffusion length of 0 25 m using eq 3 and the transmissive zone volume fraction for each scenario all three of the key factors used by remchlor md can be calculated step 3 changes in plume lengths were estimated by comparing the plume lengths obtained in step 2 with matrix diffusion to the plume lengths obtained in step 1 no matrix diffusion fig 4 shows an example 2 dimensional plume map for case 2 scenario 3 3 results and discussion in all cases plume lengths are shorter when matrix diffusion is present and included as a fate and transport process fig 5 shows the matrix diffusion attenuation process as a function of years after the release occurred for the moderate seepage velocity case for all the different combinations of aquitard configuration and the low k lens layer fractions in the transmissive zone each point on the graph shows the ratio of a particular combination of aquitard configuration and fraction of clay lenses layers where the theoretical modeled plume length reduction plume reduction caused by matrix diffusion is defined as the percent reduction in the plume length after 100 years of migration due to matrix diffusion eq 7 7 plume reduction due to matrix diffusion effect 1 plume length with matrix diffusion plume length without matrix diffusion 100 the plume length boundary was defined as being 0 070 Œºg l the u s environmental protection agency usepa preliminary remediation goal for pfos pfoa usepa 2019 these results show that the presence of low k lenses layers within the transmissive zone has a greater impact on plume length than the presence of aquitards on the top and or bottom of the transmissive zone for example for the no aquitards case the presence of just 20 of low k interfaces within the transmissive zone will reduce plume length by about 16 after 50 years of plume development fig 5 top panel red line while having no lenses but top and bottom aquitards reduce plume length by only 3 fig 5 bottom panel blue line compared to the case where there is no matrix diffusion remchlor md can calculate the constituent mass present in the transmissive zone vs in low k zones within the model domain at any time during the simulation table 2 shows the percent fraction of pfos in the low k unit for case 2 scenarios 1 through 5 at the 50 year and 100 year timeframes fig 6 shows the reduction in plume length resulting from matrix diffusion on the y axis for three different groundwater seepage velocities for the low and moderate seepage velocity simulations in fig 6 the plume reduction with and without aquitards were only different by a percentage point the high seepage velocity simulation plume reductions were lower than the low and moderate seepage velocity simulations fig 7 presents the theoretical simulated plume length vs time for the different matrix diffusion cases using the input parameters shown in table 1 for a no aquitard case at 50 years of travel time having the transmissive zone contain 80 low k lenses layers results in a plume approximately 170 m long without any aquitards or low k lenses layers the plume would be approximately 700 m long about 4 times longer several representative cases of different moderate seepage velocity matrix diffusion scenarios were selected from the figures and are presented in more detail in table 3 these modeling simulations demonstrate that matrix diffusion processes can attenuate significant constituent mass in expanding plumes over long timescales thereby effectively sequestering constituents and protecting downgradient receptors for many decades more importantly at any time and place in an aquifer when matrix diffusion is properly considered a non degradable plume will be significantly shorter than the plume length suggested by a conventional analytical model or a conventional finite difference model that does not account for matrix diffusion e g see farhat et al 2020 while matrix diffusion alone may not completely stabilize a plume the plume will likely expand at a much lower rate and over a reduced distance before ultimately stabilizing due to transverse dispersion this slower expansion effect has recently been demonstrated at a field site in a companion paper kulkarni et al 2022 applied remchlor md to a pfas research site and were able to match the observed field data much better than a no matrix diffusion model due to the mixing effects of transverse dispersion all plumes including those with infinite sources and or non degradable constituents will eventually stabilize at any given concentration limit looney et al 2006 observed that transverse dispersion can result in plume stability for a given c c 0 even if there are no degradation mechanisms operating for a site the authors provided design charts showing the maximum plume length that could be expected for different fate and transport assumptions including the case where no plume biodegradation was occurring and the plume was controlled by dispersion alone in that study longitudinal dispersity at any time was assumed to be about 10 of the plume length and transverse dispersivity about 1 of longitudinal dispersivity i e for a plume 1000 m long the transverse dispersivity is about 1000 0 01 10 m more recent research by zech et al 2015 re evaluated the use of scaling factors based on plume length to estimate dispersivity using a subset of the literature data and analysis of more reliable datapoints resulted in a greatly reduced range of macrodispersivity values between 0 1 m and 10 m for travel distances up to 3 500 m zech et al 2019 studied empirical transverse dispersivity data and came to a similar conclusion observing no clear scale dependency in dispersivity the authors noted that for the most reliable dispersivity data the transverse dispersivity ranged from 1 to 10 of the longitudinal dispersivity it is likely that the process of down selecting data from the literature eliminated many sites where matrix diffusion effects were observed and with those effects lumped into the estimated dispersivity i e the calculated dispersivity served as a fitting parameter that accounted for both hydrodynamic dispersion and for matrix diffusion thus the lower range of dispersivity values zech et al 2015 2019 was selected for our parametric analysis because matrix diffusion is being modeled as an explicit parameter note that if one uses the zech interpretation of no scale dependency and generally lower dispersivities at field sites then plumes that are subject only to flow and dispersion i e no degradation will travel farther before stabilizing compared to the estimates from looney et al 2006 a sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate the impact of the source term on the theoretical simulated plume lengths for the parameters in table 1 for a concentration limit of 0 070 Œºg l higher source concentrations meant longer simulated plume lengths after 100 years of plume transport fig 8 different source masses ranging from 0 1 kg to 100 kg had little effect on the simulated plume lengths at 100 years fig s3 complete source remediation 40 years after the initial release e g source active from 1980 to 2020 had no discernable effect on the simulated plume lengths at 100 years because the leading edge of the simulated decades old plume was not controlled by relatively recent changes in the source zone fig s4 this is not surprising as any change upgradient would take time to impact downgradient locations even if the source material was removed completely due to the expansive nature of the plume constituent in addition these results also show that the fraction of low k material within the transmissive zone has a greater impact on plume reduction than the presence of top and or bottom aquitards during this plume expansion phase this is counter to the observations of borden et al 2020 and borden and cha 2021 of the impact of matrix diffusion on a different metric the time to reach cleanup criteria for shrinking plumes bottom panel on fig 1 where the presence of aquitards was a much more important factor than low k lenses layers this difference can be explained by the very different nature of expanding vs shrinking plumes for shrinking plumes timescales are very long and the thinner low k units are depleted much more quickly than the thicker aquitards in these cases it is the slow release of groundwater constituents via back diffusion from aquitards that controls the time to reach a groundwater cleanup standard in contrast for expanding plumes which are addressed in our study the thin low k lenses encountered by the expanding plume serve as a sink for the constituents therefore as the plume expands these lenses layers play an increasingly larger role in plume migration and or curtailment the remchlor md modeling simulations suggests that not only does matrix diffusion slow the rate of plume expansion but it also contributes to decreasing the plume expansion rate over time for the no matrix diffusion example in table 3 the average annual rate of plume expansion in years 10 50 and 100 was 16 12 and 11 m per year respectively between year 10 and year 100 the plume expansion rate decreased by 31 due to dispersion however for the case in table 3 with matrix diffusion 40 layers lenses and top and bottom aquitard the corresponding plume expansion rate was significantly lower 10 3 6 2 and 4 7 m per year respectively for years 10 50 and 100 between year 10 and year 100 the plume expansion rate decreased by 54 due to dispersion and matrix diffusion therefore matrix diffusion not only slows plume expansion for expanding plumes but also accelerates the slowdown in the annual plume expansion rate over decadal timescales both findings are in line with those observed in modeling an actual pfos site discussed in kulkarni et al 2022 3 1 factors that could result in other outcomes overall this theoretical modeling analysis of a hypothetical non degrading plume with the specific table 1 input data suggests that complete stabilization via transverse dispersion steady state may require relatively long timeframes and relatively long plume lengths however there are several factors that could result in very different outcomes at actual field sites as discussed below first zech et al 2015 stress that the actual macrodispersivity in a geologic formation is site specific therefore a sensitivity analysis was performed with a higher longitudinal and transverse dispersivity 21 m and 2 1 m respectively the maximum recommended values in farhat et al 2018 and shown in table 4 with these higher dispersivities the 100 year plume lengths shown in table 3 are two to eight times shorter than the plume lengths with lower dispersivities shown in table 3 with much less impact from matrix diffusion second different aquifer matrix diffusion configurations and input data can lead to different results from the model results based on table 1 for example the thickness of the low k lenses layers within the 10 m thick transmissive zone affects the extent of long term pfaa plume migration for the case 2 scenario 5 thinner low k layer lenses decreased the plume length from 245 m to 160 m table 5 this behavior is explained by the increased surface area of low k interfaces amd when the same fraction of the aquifer thickness is filled with thinner layers lenses in the same fashion thicker layers lens increased the simulated plume length from 245 m to 430 m decreasing the retardation factor of the low k units from 3 3 to 1 0 decreased the attenuation effect of matrix diffusion and therefore increased the simulated plume length from 245 to 440 m table 5 in these simulations the retardation factor of the transmissive zone was unchanged at 2 7 table 1 doubling the retardation factor in the low k units from 3 3 to 6 6 had the opposite effect and the simulated plume length was reduced from 245 m to 175 m after 100 years of plume travel table 5 overall sorption in the low k zones was a relatively important parameter for pfos retention in this particular simulation case 2 scenario 5 with the no low k sorption plume length being over twice as long as the high low k sorption case 440 m vs 175 m thus low k sorption could contribute to a chromatography effect at sites where different pfas with different sorption properties have different plume lengths decreasing the effective diffusion coefficients equal to pfos diffusion coefficient in water times tortuosity by 50 for the case 2 scenario 5 simulations increased the simulated plume length as matrix diffusion was not as strong while doubling the effective diffusion coefficient reduced the plume length however these changes only changed the plume length by less than 25 table s1 aquifer thickness is also a sensitive remchlor md configuration parameter when aquitards are included in the model using the table 1 input data but with a 1 m aquifer thickness instead of 10 m a non degrading plume in an aquifer with top and bottom aquitards and 40 layers lenses is forecasted to be only 490 m long after 100 years this plume is 33 shorter than the 730 m long plume predicted for a 10 m thick aquifer shown in table 3 third sites with fluctuating groundwater flow directions sometimes referred to as a fire hose effect will have shorter plume lengths than the assumed constant 1 dimensional groundwater flow direction assumed in the theoretical simulations this is due to the fact that there is a larger volume low k material into which the plume can diffuse fourth as newell et al 2020 noted that with respect to pfas the history of the contaminant transport field is more heavily weighted to underestimating the attenuation of emerging contaminants rather than overestimating it the current understanding of this non degrading compound class pfaas strongly indicates that these compounds are stable under ambient conditions however if future research shows that these compounds degrade even very slowly half lives of decades or centuries this could have a significant effect on the extent of long term pfaa plume migration in our modeling analysis for the general case of a slowly degrading groundwater constituent in an aquifer with base case conditions seepage velocity of 30 5 m per year retardation factor of 2 7 in the transmissive zone and a source concentration of 0 2 Œºg l a degradation half life of 10 years stabilizes plume length at approximately 100 m fifth sorption processes for emerging non degrading compounds such as pfaas are still being studied and future research could indicate that the simple linear isotherm approach used here is inadequate for modeling plume migration sixth the simulations in this paper do not consider the transformation of pfas precursors to pfaas like pfos at sites with significant precursor transformation in plumes the pfos plumes may behave differently from the results shown in this paper seventh diffusion of anionic non degrading groundwater constituents such as pfaas may have different matrix diffusion processes compared to conventional constituents such as chlorinated solvents schaefer et al 2021 described how a standard pore diffusion model with linear adsorption parameters substantially underpredicted matrix diffusion of six pfaas into a clay rich soil for pfas surface diffusion processes solute migration within mineral layers or other near surface electrical boundaries were about the same magnitude as conventional pore based diffusion schaefer et al 2021 notes that enhanced diffusion into low permeability clays would likely serve to mitigate downgradient pfaa attenuation based on this observation a simple conceptual experiment was performed as part of the current paper where the pfos molecular diffusion coefficient in the remchlor md base case was doubled to capture some form of enhanced diffusion however 100 year plume lengths shown in the base case in table 3 did not change substantially 0 to 12 reduction data not shown because both forward and back diffusion were enhanced in remchlor md however matrix diffusion non enhanced or enhanced with hysteretic desorption would likely result in higher true attenuation of the expanding pfos plume given these uncertainties this theoretical modeling exercise presented in this paper can be used to understand the general behavior of non degrading and recalcitrant plumes but may not be suitable for predicting plume behavior on a site specific basis as recommended by newell et al 2021b at any given site the actual behavior of the plume stable shrinking etc will require a site specific assessment 4 conclusions developing mna for non degrading groundwater constituents such as pfaas is important because currently there are no practical remediation technologies that have been shown to destroy pfaas in situ furthermore management of pfaa plumes using pump and treat systems is costly both in terms of finances and natural resource consumption with resultant poor sustainability metrics our key finding is that matrix diffusion is likely to be a very important attenuation process at many sites when modeling the migration of non degrading constituents in groundwater such as pfaas reducing the rate that the plume expands compared to a no matrix diffusion case in one 100 year travel time modeling scenario pfos migration with matrix diffusion resulted in a simulated plume length that was 81 shorter than plume length when modeled without matrix diffusion in addition matrix diffusion not only slows plume expansion for expanding plumes but also accelerates the slowdown in the annual plume expansion rate over decadal timescales in general a non degrading or recalcitrant compound may continue to expand until transverse dispersion processes effectively dilute the groundwater plume to concentrations below the relevant regulatory criterion however when a groundwater plume is expanding matrix diffusion can act as an effective peak shaving process that converts a strong signal mass discharge of the contaminant toward receptors to a much lower but longer lasting signal newell et al 2020 while the same amount of constituents may leave the source zone as a site not impacted by matrix diffusion the amount reaching potential receptors at concentrations above action levels may be less or even zero therefore the timescale of the retention processes and the general mass discharge vs time pattern in proximity to potential receptors will be important to consider with regard to the feasibility of mna for management of non degrading groundwater constituents sites where sorption and matrix diffusion processes slow or effectively stop the expansion of plumes of non degrading groundwater constituents could be good candidates for a retention based mna strategy as described by newell et al 2021a 2021b in this case a plume assimilative capacity zone in front of the existing plume could be reserved for future retention of an expanding non degrading plume similar to allowances for expanding plumes that are now in place under certain environmental

1322,groundwater fate and transport modeling results demonstrate that matrix diffusion plays a role in attenuating the expansion of groundwater plumes of non degrading or highly recalcitrant compounds this is especially significant for systems where preferred destructive attenuation processes such as biological and abiotic degradation are weak or ineffective for plume control under these conditions models of nondestructive physical attenuation processes traditionally dispersion or sorption do not demonstrate sufficient plume control unless matrix diffusion is considered matrix diffusion has been shown to be a notable emergent impact of geological heterogeneity typically associated with back diffusion and extending remediation timeframes through concentration tailing of the trailing edge of a plume however less attention has been placed on evaluating how matrix diffusion can serve as an attenuation mechanism for the leading edge of a plume of non degrading compounds like perfluoroalkyl acids pfaas including perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos in this study the remchlor md model was parametrically applied to a generic unconsolidated and heterogeneous geologic site with a constant pfos source and no degradation of pfos in the downgradient edge of the plume low levels of mechanical dispersion and retardation were used in the model for three different geologic heterogeneity cases ranging from no matrix diffusion e g sand only to considerable matrix diffusion using low permeability low k layers lenses and or aquitards our analysis shows that in theory many non degrading plumes may expand for significant time periods before dispersion alone would eventually stabilize the plume however matrix diffusion can significantly slow the rate and degree of this migration for one 100 year travel time scenario consideration of matrix diffusion results in a simulated pfos plume length that is over 80 shorter than the plume length simulated without matrix diffusion although many non degrading plumes may continue to slowly expand over time matrix diffusion resulted in lower concentrations and smaller plume footprints modeling multiple hydrogeologic settings showed that the effect of matrix diffusion is more significant in transmissive zones containing multiple low k lenses layers than transmissive zones underlain and overlain by low k aquitards this study found that at sites with significant matrix diffusion groundwater plumes will be shorter will expand more slowly and may be amenable to a physical retention based monitored natural attenuation mna paradigm in this case a small plume assimilative capacity zone in front of the existing plume could be reserved for slow de minimus future expansion of a non degrading plume if potential receptors are protected in this scenario then this approach is similar to allowances for expanding plumes under some existing environmental regulatory programs accounting for matrix diffusion may support new strategic approaches and alternative paradigms for remediation even for sites and conditions with non degrading constituents such as pfaas metals metalloids and radionuclides keywords pfas monitored natural attenuation matrix diffusion low permeability non degradable modeling 1 introduction chemical diffusion in and out of low permeability low k geologic media is now recognized as an important groundwater fate and transport process e g fetter et al 1999 chapman and parker 2005 national research council 2005 2013 sale et al 2013 hadley and newell 2014 this matrix diffusion process is caused by heterogeneous aquifer architectures where groundwater constituents flowing through transmissive media will diffuse into semi stagnant low k media these low k media zones can be either continuous or discontinuous and are comprised of both connected and disconnected pore spaces this geologic heterogeneity and attendant matrix diffusion is one of the most prevalent hydrogeologic conditions found at hazardous waste sites national research council 2005 therefore the presence of this heterogeneity should be considered a default assumption when working at groundwater cleanup sites payne et al 2008 matrix diffusion is commonly defined as the migration of dissolved solutes from flowing macropores or fractures into the more or less stagnant pores of adjacent rock matrix winterle 1998 fig 1 shows a commonly used illustration to explain matrix diffusion a groundwater constituent plume travels through the underlying layer top panel of fig 1 and diffuses into the low k zones silt and clay above and below the transmissive sand middle panel once plume constituent concentrations in the transmissive zone fall due to source attenuation source remediation or plume remediation back diffusion occurs from the low k zones and can sustain a weaker plume in the transmissive sand for longer periods of time bottom panel most of the matrix diffusion research to date has focused on the time it takes natural processes or remediation projects to remediate groundwater plumes subject to the back diffusion processes shown in the bottom panel of fig 1 chapman and parker 2005 lipson et al 2005 sale et al 2013 national research council 2013 tatti et al 2018 2019 brooks et al 2021 borden and cha 2021 visualizations and imaging have been particularly important to explain the challenges associated with back diffusions two important contributions are doner and sale 2010 and tatti et al 2016 in this paper we evaluate the impacts of matrix diffusion along the leading edge of the plume during the time of expansion top panel in fig 1 a condition that can be of critical importance at some sites with recalcitrant groundwater constituents while this has been investigated before at a specific fractured rock site e g lipson et al 2005 this paper uses a novel application of a relatively new groundwater model remchlor md to explore the key factors and heterogeneity geometries that impact the amount of matrix diffusion related attenuation in unconsolidated hydrogeologic settings this work may be particularly important to an emerging class of groundwater constituents per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas many of which do not appear to be degrading in groundwater under natural conditions at this time although monitored natural attenuation mna is often thought of as requiring destructive processes to control groundwater plumes non destructive processes such as immobilization via sorption can also be used for mna usepa 2007 as stated by the national academies of sciences engineering and medicine 2020 matrix diffusion can be considered a natural attenuation process because it attenuates the rate at which contaminants migrate in the forward direction and it attenuates the contaminant discharge into the mobile fluid in the reverse direction matrix diffusion has been the intense focus of recent research efforts at older sites however the primary emphasis has been on the mass retained in low k units acting as a low level persistent source of constituents to moving groundwater rather than on low k units acting as sinks or as storage reservoirs that retard constituent migration during the plume expansion phase this attenuation during plume expansion has been demonstrated by historical laboratory studies of plume fate and transport from the 1980s gillham et al 1984 sudicky et al 1985 in fig 2 an experimental apparatus a column on its side was constructed to observe the breakthrough curve for a chloride tracer sudicky et al 1985 with no matrix diffusion numerical modeling showed the red breakthrough curve would have occurred but actual data from the column experiments showed a much retarded attenuated breakthrough curve blue line the authors commented the experimental results show a delay in the breakthrough of the tracer in the effluent of the permeable sand layer along with a substantial decrease in concentration after a 1 m travel distance in a related 1984 paper gillham et al expanded on this finding stating a second consequence of the solute storage effect offered by transverse diffusion into low permeability layers is a rate of migration of the frontal portion of a contaminant in the permeable layers that is less than the groundwater velocity while these experiments were performed at the very beginning of the groundwater transport boom that occurred from 1975 to 2005 schwartz et al 2019 subsequent developments showed that many of the key groundwater constituents were controlled to some degree by biodegradation and that many groundwater plumes were shrinking or stable in two multiple site studies of several hundred hydrocarbon sites over 90 of the groundwater plumes were found to be either stable shrinking or exhausted low concentration stable plumes largely due to the rapid biodegradation of dissolved constituents in these plumes newell and connor 1998 wiedemeier et al 1998 connor et al 2014 one study of chlorinated solvent plumes being considered for mna showed that only 9 of the plumes were expanding mcguire et al 2004 demonstrating that biodegradation is occurring is a key focus of most mna protocols for organic groundwater constituents e g wiedemeier et al 1995 1998 due to the delay in time between initial release and initiation of remediation activities at many sites with conventional degrading compounds by the time site characterization began the active period of groundwater plume growth had already occurred and the plumes had already stabilized or were in a state of declining growth this state allowed for many to be controlled by remediation projects that addressed stable or near stable transport conditions therefore site managers and consultants may not have encountered as many expanding plumes making early stage attenuation more difficult to conceptualize and quantify a few studies have focused on the direct mechanical attenuation effects from matrix diffusion lipson et al 2005 modeled a fractured rock aquifer using a relatively simple geometry comprised of a parallel plate discrete fracture solute transport model dfm the model showed that the plume migration rate into a fractured sandstone rock aquifer can be much lower than the groundwater seepage velocity because of matrix diffusion effects when applying their model to an actual field site the authors found that there was 800 time more mass of the non degrading solute chloride in the sandstone matrix compared to the chloride mass in the fractures at steady state conditions currently there is an emerging class of groundwater constituents pfas that are different than conventional groundwater constituents such as hydrocarbons methyl tert butyl ether mtbe and chlorinated solvents in several ways newell et al 2020 while some pfas can degrade partially under naturally occurring conditions this degradation step appears to terminate when the compound becomes fully fluorinated as a perfluoroalkyl acid pfaa forming a highly stable molecule in the environment at present there are no practical groundwater remediation technologies that have been shown to destroy pfaa plumes in situ simon et al 2019 greatly limiting pfas site management options therefore many pfas groundwater sites requiring plume management rely on groundwater pump and treat technology a costly and inefficient approach from which the remediation industry has spent the last few decades backing away simon et al 2019 pfas is a particular example of highly recalcitrant compounds but there are other metals metalloids e g chromate or pertechnetate in oxic systems and long lived radionuclides e g radioiodine that have minimal degradation potential because of different fate and transport characteristics understanding how matrix diffusion might attenuate the growth of pfas plumes could be important for managing these plumes adamson et al 2020 potentially using retention based mna newell et al 2021a 2021b newell et al 2021a describes how expanding plumes might be managed with a plume assimilative capacity zone similar to plume management zones pmzs that allow some level of plume expansion in some existing groundwater regulatory programs 2 methods 2 1 matrix diffusion modeling methodology despite the recognized importance of matrix diffusion the current state of practice in 2021 for groundwater modeling is to use an advection dispersion model often including sorption and degradation processes to simulate groundwater plume migration hadley and newell 2014 however almost all of today s commonly used analytical groundwater models such as bioscreen newell et al 1996 and biochlor aziz et al 2000 do not explicitly model matrix diffusion in addition simulating matrix diffusion in common field scale applications with finite differences models such as mt3d or modpath can lead to inaccurate results when applied to field sites unless unusually fine discretization is used chapman et al 2012 farhat et al 2020 dual porosity mass transfer models have been used to simulate the matrix diffusion caused by embedded heterogeneity however this method requires a mass transfer coefficient that cannot be easily estimated from field data such as boring logs that describe geologic heterogeneity this coefficient also tends to be time dependent meaning that a mass transfer coefficient that works well to match short term data but may not work well for long term data and vice versa as an alternative technique the semi analytic method developed by muskus and falta 2018 is a more general and overall more accurate method for modeling matrix diffusion 2 2 the remchlor md matrix diffusion model more recently a key tool for understanding and demonstrating the effect of matrix diffusion on attenuation has emerged estcp s remchlor md model falta et al 2018 farhat et al 2018 muskus and falta 2018 estcp s remchlor md was developed to properly account for heterogeneity and matrix diffusion in groundwater transport models in its essence remchlor md is a semi analytical model for source behavior and plume response but more importantly it is capable of implementing matrix diffusion within the algorithm the model assumes 1 dimensional groundwater flow and 3 dimensional dispersion over a 3 dimensional array of defined gridblocks the transport code written in fortran falta et al 2018 was incorporated into a graphical user interface developed using the microsoft excel spreadsheet platform farhat et al 2018 the remchlor md source term uses a power law approach to simulate the relationship between mass discharge leaving the source and the remaining mass in the source the plume model uses a numerical semi analytical solution for advection dispersion sorption and biodegradation of parent daughter compounds that accounts for matrix diffusion into and back out of e g back diffusion low k zones the model specifically models the diffusion into low k geologic media the time it is stored within these media and then the rate of back diffusion over time by using this powerful model researchers and practitioners can simulate the complex interaction of a wide variety of factors such as changes in the source strength over time due to natural depletion of source mass or by source remediation falta et al 2005 changes in the decay rates high k and low k zones in the plume for parent and daughter compounds in time and space such as the impact of plume remediation projects and different geometries of matrix diffusion aquitards overlying or underlying a transmissive zone and or embedded layers lenses within the transmissive zone the governing partial differential equations for transient matrix diffusion assuming first order decay of a component m 1 that produces a daughter compound m are shown in equations 1 and 2 muskus and falta 2018 1 r lm c lm t œÑ l d 2 c lm z l 2 Œª lm c lm m 1 2 r lm c lm t œÑ l d 2 c lm z l 2 y lm 1 Œª lm 1 c lm 1 Œª lm c lm m 1 where the subscript l indicates the low k material and zl represents the distance into the low k material the variable r lm is the retardation factor of component m œÑ l is the tortuosity d is the diffusion coefficient y lm 1 is the mass yield of the daughter component m from the parent m 1 and Œª l m is the first order decay rate of component m remchlor md uses a semi analytical method to approximate equations 1 and 2 in each gridblock at each timestep by using a fitting function to describe the concentration profile as a function of distance from the high k low k interface 3 c lm c m t Œ¥ t p m z

remchlor md numerical formulation can be found in muskus and falta 2018 2 3 how remchlor md accounts for geologic heterogeneity in the remchlor md model users enter geologic heterogeneity data via the heterogeneity calculator portion of the graphical user interface in this part of the interface users enter geologic data to allow two independent calculations to simulate matrix diffusion in aquifers impact of low k aquitards the user describes if the aquifer being modeled has any low k aquitards on the top bottom or both top and bottom fig s1 an unconfined aquifer overlying a low k unit such as a clay layer would be represented with the second of the four panels the third panel representing a low k aquitard on the top of the transmissive zone behaves identically to the aquitard on bottom configuration the fourth panel has both top and bottom aquitards the first panel represents a system with no aquitards such as a thick continuous sand unit with the plume only residing in the top or middle of the formation the model assumes infinitely thick aquitards that serve first as a sink then a source of groundwater constituents to the transmissive zone over time impact of embedded low k layers lenses between the top and bottom of the plume the remchlor md model can simulate the matrix diffusion effects from different densities and geometries of embedded low k layers lenses between the top and bottom of the plume fig s2 the model uses three geometrical heterogeneity parameters developed by muskus and falta 2018 to define matrix diffusion in the layers lenses within the transmissive zone 1 transmissive zone volume fraction which is equal to one minus the low k volume fraction vf 2 average diffusion length l half of the average thickness of embedded low k layers lenses and 3 surface area of low k interfaces amd within a gridblock knowledge of the first two of these three factors can be used to calculate the third factor the surface area of low k interfaces using a volume balance on the low k material muskus and falta 2018 the total volume vi of a gridblock and eq 6 6 v i 1 v f a md l as shown in fig s2 users modeling unconsolidated sites can select a generic configuration of the transmissive zone volume fraction one of the five panels shown ranging from 0 to 80 low k material and then add an average diffusion length e g average thickness of the embedded layers lenses alternatively users can directly enter site specific geologic data from up to 100 geologic boring logs and the interface will estimate the three heterogeneity parameters the model can also be used to simulate matrix diffusion in fractured rock assuming a parallel fracture network the definition of the site specific low k material is important when modeling matrix diffusion in remchlor md as there are several different definitions of what comprises low k material in the literature brooks et al 2021 described the features of a low permeable zone lpz with a 10 5 cm s threshold citing walden 1997 and a 10 4 cm s limit from horst et al 2019 others have used hydraulic conductivity contrasts where a transmissive zone in contact with a low k zone has a hydraulic conductivity of 100 higher than the adjacent low k zone dr beth parker cited in farhat et al 2018 sale et al 2013 combine diffusion and slow advection when conceptualizing fate and transport in heterogeneous porous media which indicates that relatively low hydraulic conductivity ratios may be sufficient for defining low k units in remchlor md payne 2016 showed the contact between a sandy transmissive zone with 1 5 low k silt and a second sandy zone with only moderately higher content of low k silt or finer materials 7 17 would result in significantly higher diffusive mass storage making the second siltier sand zone act like a low k unit even though the stratum is predominately sand with regard to the transmissive zone volume fraction an empirical study of 141 boring logs from 43 sites in california indicated that the more permeable 30 of the aquifer cross section carried 90 of the groundwater flow kulkarni et al 2020 fig 3 this dataset suggests that a typical plume in this study was in a hydrogeologic setting where roughly 70 of geologic media served as a low k unit for the purposes of quantifying potential matrix diffusion effects in remchlor md users enter the hydraulic conductivity of the predominant transmissive soils in the plume typically sands or gravels which does not include the permeability of the low k layers or lenses this value called the transmissive zone groundwater darcy velocity is then reduced in the model by multiplying by the transmissive zone volume fraction to yield an average darcy velocity for the aquifer cross section farhat et al 2018 with these elements users can define geologic heterogeneity to account for matrix diffusion in unconsolidated aquifers based on the method developed by falta and wang 2017 and muskus and falta 2018 note that a separate calculation is performed in the remchlor md interface if users are simulating fractured rock this method is not addressed in this paper however the resulting conclusions of this paper are expected to be similar or even stronger for high matrix porosity media based on the results of lipson et al 2005 2 4 fate and transport modeling of pfos for this study remchlor md was used to model a hypothetical non degrading compound with source concentration and linear sorption data similar to a perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos plume pfos is one of the most environmentally important pfas due its mobility and low regulatory criteria e g newell et al 2020 while there are uncertainties associated with pfas fate and transport e g simon et al 2019 key processes in the saturated zone during plume expansion are understood well enough to perform screening level modeling of pfos migration as described below advection no differences with other groundwater constituents mechanical dispersion no known differences with other groundwater constituents matrix diffusion pfos matrix diffusion has been verified to occur at field sites e g adamson et al 2021 sorption pfos sorption is complex with partitioning to air water interfaces and non aqueous phase liquids napls brusseau 2018 as well as sorption via electrostatic hydrophobic and ion exchange mechanisms zhang et al 2019 desorption can show significant hysteresis brusseau et al 2019 sima and jaff√© 2021 however for modeling plume expansion constant source sorption only no desorption in the saturated zone plume no air water partitioning no napl in the plume a linear sorption isotherm model may capture most of the sorption processes a generic equilibrium based sorption model based on a dual equilibrium desorption process assumes that sorption processes are linear while desorption can result in significant hysteresis kan et al 1998 chen et al 2002 sima and jaff√© 2021 state however at low pfas concentrations a linear k d may be sufficient depending on soil pfas solvent interactions which for pfos was less than 100 350 Œºg l the 75th percentile pfos source zone concentration of 1600 pfas source zones compiled by anderson 2019 was 2 8 Œºg l newell et al 2020 which is significantly less than the 100 to 350 Œºg l threshold identified by sima and jaff√© 2021 consequently the linear kd assumption may be appropriate for most plumes furthermore because only pfos plume expansion is being evaluated in this paper the linear sorption model in remchlor md is likely to be an adequate representation of actual pfos sorption in groundwater biodegradation pfaas like pfos have not been shown to degrade under ambient environmental conditions naidu et al 2020 itrc 2021 therefore no degradation was simulated pfas is comprised of thousands of different compounds with widely different behaviors so the results of the pfos modeling cannot be directly transferred to other pfas overall the modeling exercise assumed a saturated zone only pfos plume with no non aqueous phase liquids but with matrix diffusion impacts similar to the one at the site characterized by adamson et al 2020 and nickerson et al 2021 however the degree of matrix diffusion was varied to explore the impact of heterogeneity on plume expansion 2 5 modeling impact of geologic heterogeneity on plume expansion to estimate the impacts of diffusion each model domain was divided into four layers each 2 5 m thick and extended 2500 m in the direction of groundwater flow through an unconsolidated formation each model assumed no remediation of the source or plume and allowed plumes to move throughout the flow system from a constant source zone for a period of 100 years first three different levels of geologic boundary conditions were compared for this study case 1 no aquitards only the transmissive media were used in the model this case assumed there were no aquitards with low k zones overlying or underlying the transmissive zone that could serve as a sink for groundwater constituents during plume expansion case 2 bottom aquitard this case assumed that the transmissive zone was underlain by an aquitard case 3 top and bottom aquitards this case assumed that the transmissive zone was bracketed by both underlying and overlying aquitards second geologic heterogeneity from low k layers lenses within the transmissive zone was then added in step 2 below for each case reductions in plume lengths after source release were determined as follows step 1 plume lengths were determined without matrix diffusion being explicitly modeled this scenario would be akin to a traditional modeling solution a concentration of 2 8 Œºg l was used for the source concentration in the model as a base case groundwater seepage velocities calculated from 290 groundwater sites newell et al 1990 were used to develop moderate low and high range seepage velocities for the modeling other input data are described in table 1 the plume boundary was defined as being 0 070 Œºg l the u s environmental protection agency usepa preliminary remediation goal for pfos pfoa usepa 2019 step 2 each model was re run with matrix diffusion explicitly incorporated with different combinations of aquitards and layers lenses assuming matrix diffusion was occurring at the site plume lengths were estimated for scenarios with increasing percentage of relatively thin low k lenses layers e g sandy clays sandy silts silts clays see fig s2 embedded within the transmissive zone i e between an assumed no flow boundary such as the water table or between aquitards see fig s1 for each group of scenarios the no matrix diffusion and matrix diffusion cases were assumed to have the same groundwater seepage velocities for simplicity and because of the various configurations in the different cases e g presence of top bottom or both aquitards etc the average concentration over the full saturated thickness was used to establish the plume length specifically plume lengths were estimated assuming these scenarios for embedded low k units scenario 1 there were no low k lenses layers embedded in the transmissive zone scenario 2 20 of the transmissive zone contained embedded low k lenses layers scenario 3 40 of the transmissive zone was embedded with low k lenses layers scenario 4 60 of the transmissive zone contained embedded low k lenses layers and scenario 5 80 of the transmissive zone was embedded with low k lenses layers the scenarios with 40 to 60 of the transmissive zone embedded with low k lenses layers approximate the middle range value of the 42 actual groundwater sites in california that were analyzed by kulkarni et al 2020 to determine groundwater flow vs cumulative area relationships for the initial case shown in table 1 the average low k layer thickness was assumed to be 0 5 m thick based on results from kulkarni et al 2020 this corresponds to an average diffusion length of 0 25 m using eq 3 and the transmissive zone volume fraction for each scenario all three of the key factors used by remchlor md can be calculated step 3 changes in plume lengths were estimated by comparing the plume lengths obtained in step 2 with matrix diffusion to the plume lengths obtained in step 1 no matrix diffusion fig 4 shows an example 2 dimensional plume map for case 2 scenario 3 3 results and discussion in all cases plume lengths are shorter when matrix diffusion is present and included as a fate and transport process fig 5 shows the matrix diffusion attenuation process as a function of years after the release occurred for the moderate seepage velocity case for all the different combinations of aquitard configuration and the low k lens layer fractions in the transmissive zone each point on the graph shows the ratio of a particular combination of aquitard configuration and fraction of clay lenses layers where the theoretical modeled plume length reduction plume reduction caused by matrix diffusion is defined as the percent reduction in the plume length after 100 years of migration due to matrix diffusion eq 7 7 plume reduction due to matrix diffusion effect 1 plume length with matrix diffusion plume length without matrix diffusion 100 the plume length boundary was defined as being 0 070 Œºg l the u s environmental protection agency usepa preliminary remediation goal for pfos pfoa usepa 2019 these results show that the presence of low k lenses layers within the transmissive zone has a greater impact on plume length than the presence of aquitards on the top and or bottom of the transmissive zone for example for the no aquitards case the presence of just 20 of low k interfaces within the transmissive zone will reduce plume length by about 16 after 50 years of plume development fig 5 top panel red line while having no lenses but top and bottom aquitards reduce plume length by only 3 fig 5 bottom panel blue line compared to the case where there is no matrix diffusion remchlor md can calculate the constituent mass present in the transmissive zone vs in low k zones within the model domain at any time during the simulation table 2 shows the percent fraction of pfos in the low k unit for case 2 scenarios 1 through 5 at the 50 year and 100 year timeframes fig 6 shows the reduction in plume length resulting from matrix diffusion on the y axis for three different groundwater seepage velocities for the low and moderate seepage velocity simulations in fig 6 the plume reduction with and without aquitards were only different by a percentage point the high seepage velocity simulation plume reductions were lower than the low and moderate seepage velocity simulations fig 7 presents the theoretical simulated plume length vs time for the different matrix diffusion cases using the input parameters shown in table 1 for a no aquitard case at 50 years of travel time having the transmissive zone contain 80 low k lenses layers results in a plume approximately 170 m long without any aquitards or low k lenses layers the plume would be approximately 700 m long about 4 times longer several representative cases of different moderate seepage velocity matrix diffusion scenarios were selected from the figures and are presented in more detail in table 3 these modeling simulations demonstrate that matrix diffusion processes can attenuate significant constituent mass in expanding plumes over long timescales thereby effectively sequestering constituents and protecting downgradient receptors for many decades more importantly at any time and place in an aquifer when matrix diffusion is properly considered a non degradable plume will be significantly shorter than the plume length suggested by a conventional analytical model or a conventional finite difference model that does not account for matrix diffusion e g see farhat et al 2020 while matrix diffusion alone may not completely stabilize a plume the plume will likely expand at a much lower rate and over a reduced distance before ultimately stabilizing due to transverse dispersion this slower expansion effect has recently been demonstrated at a field site in a companion paper kulkarni et al 2022 applied remchlor md to a pfas research site and were able to match the observed field data much better than a no matrix diffusion model due to the mixing effects of transverse dispersion all plumes including those with infinite sources and or non degradable constituents will eventually stabilize at any given concentration limit looney et al 2006 observed that transverse dispersion can result in plume stability for a given c c 0 even if there are no degradation mechanisms operating for a site the authors provided design charts showing the maximum plume length that could be expected for different fate and transport assumptions including the case where no plume biodegradation was occurring and the plume was controlled by dispersion alone in that study longitudinal dispersity at any time was assumed to be about 10 of the plume length and transverse dispersivity about 1 of longitudinal dispersivity i e for a plume 1000 m long the transverse dispersivity is about 1000 0 01 10 m more recent research by zech et al 2015 re evaluated the use of scaling factors based on plume length to estimate dispersivity using a subset of the literature data and analysis of more reliable datapoints resulted in a greatly reduced range of macrodispersivity values between 0 1 m and 10 m for travel distances up to 3 500 m zech et al 2019 studied empirical transverse dispersivity data and came to a similar conclusion observing no clear scale dependency in dispersivity the authors noted that for the most reliable dispersivity data the transverse dispersivity ranged from 1 to 10 of the longitudinal dispersivity it is likely that the process of down selecting data from the literature eliminated many sites where matrix diffusion effects were observed and with those effects lumped into the estimated dispersivity i e the calculated dispersivity served as a fitting parameter that accounted for both hydrodynamic dispersion and for matrix diffusion thus the lower range of dispersivity values zech et al 2015 2019 was selected for our parametric analysis because matrix diffusion is being modeled as an explicit parameter note that if one uses the zech interpretation of no scale dependency and generally lower dispersivities at field sites then plumes that are subject only to flow and dispersion i e no degradation will travel farther before stabilizing compared to the estimates from looney et al 2006 a sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate the impact of the source term on the theoretical simulated plume lengths for the parameters in table 1 for a concentration limit of 0 070 Œºg l higher source concentrations meant longer simulated plume lengths after 100 years of plume transport fig 8 different source masses ranging from 0 1 kg to 100 kg had little effect on the simulated plume lengths at 100 years fig s3 complete source remediation 40 years after the initial release e g source active from 1980 to 2020 had no discernable effect on the simulated plume lengths at 100 years because the leading edge of the simulated decades old plume was not controlled by relatively recent changes in the source zone fig s4 this is not surprising as any change upgradient would take time to impact downgradient locations even if the source material was removed completely due to the expansive nature of the plume constituent in addition these results also show that the fraction of low k material within the transmissive zone has a greater impact on plume reduction than the presence of top and or bottom aquitards during this plume expansion phase this is counter to the observations of borden et al 2020 and borden and cha 2021 of the impact of matrix diffusion on a different metric the time to reach cleanup criteria for shrinking plumes bottom panel on fig 1 where the presence of aquitards was a much more important factor than low k lenses layers this difference can be explained by the very different nature of expanding vs shrinking plumes for shrinking plumes timescales are very long and the thinner low k units are depleted much more quickly than the thicker aquitards in these cases it is the slow release of groundwater constituents via back diffusion from aquitards that controls the time to reach a groundwater cleanup standard in contrast for expanding plumes which are addressed in our study the thin low k lenses encountered by the expanding plume serve as a sink for the constituents therefore as the plume expands these lenses layers play an increasingly larger role in plume migration and or curtailment the remchlor md modeling simulations suggests that not only does matrix diffusion slow the rate of plume expansion but it also contributes to decreasing the plume expansion rate over time for the no matrix diffusion example in table 3 the average annual rate of plume expansion in years 10 50 and 100 was 16 12 and 11 m per year respectively between year 10 and year 100 the plume expansion rate decreased by 31 due to dispersion however for the case in table 3 with matrix diffusion 40 layers lenses and top and bottom aquitard the corresponding plume expansion rate was significantly lower 10 3 6 2 and 4 7 m per year respectively for years 10 50 and 100 between year 10 and year 100 the plume expansion rate decreased by 54 due to dispersion and matrix diffusion therefore matrix diffusion not only slows plume expansion for expanding plumes but also accelerates the slowdown in the annual plume expansion rate over decadal timescales both findings are in line with those observed in modeling an actual pfos site discussed in kulkarni et al 2022 3 1 factors that could result in other outcomes overall this theoretical modeling analysis of a hypothetical non degrading plume with the specific table 1 input data suggests that complete stabilization via transverse dispersion steady state may require relatively long timeframes and relatively long plume lengths however there are several factors that could result in very different outcomes at actual field sites as discussed below first zech et al 2015 stress that the actual macrodispersivity in a geologic formation is site specific therefore a sensitivity analysis was performed with a higher longitudinal and transverse dispersivity 21 m and 2 1 m respectively the maximum recommended values in farhat et al 2018 and shown in table 4 with these higher dispersivities the 100 year plume lengths shown in table 3 are two to eight times shorter than the plume lengths with lower dispersivities shown in table 3 with much less impact from matrix diffusion second different aquifer matrix diffusion configurations and input data can lead to different results from the model results based on table 1 for example the thickness of the low k lenses layers within the 10 m thick transmissive zone affects the extent of long term pfaa plume migration for the case 2 scenario 5 thinner low k layer lenses decreased the plume length from 245 m to 160 m table 5 this behavior is explained by the increased surface area of low k interfaces amd when the same fraction of the aquifer thickness is filled with thinner layers lenses in the same fashion thicker layers lens increased the simulated plume length from 245 m to 430 m decreasing the retardation factor of the low k units from 3 3 to 1 0 decreased the attenuation effect of matrix diffusion and therefore increased the simulated plume length from 245 to 440 m table 5 in these simulations the retardation factor of the transmissive zone was unchanged at 2 7 table 1 doubling the retardation factor in the low k units from 3 3 to 6 6 had the opposite effect and the simulated plume length was reduced from 245 m to 175 m after 100 years of plume travel table 5 overall sorption in the low k zones was a relatively important parameter for pfos retention in this particular simulation case 2 scenario 5 with the no low k sorption plume length being over twice as long as the high low k sorption case 440 m vs 175 m thus low k sorption could contribute to a chromatography effect at sites where different pfas with different sorption properties have different plume lengths decreasing the effective diffusion coefficients equal to pfos diffusion coefficient in water times tortuosity by 50 for the case 2 scenario 5 simulations increased the simulated plume length as matrix diffusion was not as strong while doubling the effective diffusion coefficient reduced the plume length however these changes only changed the plume length by less than 25 table s1 aquifer thickness is also a sensitive remchlor md configuration parameter when aquitards are included in the model using the table 1 input data but with a 1 m aquifer thickness instead of 10 m a non degrading plume in an aquifer with top and bottom aquitards and 40 layers lenses is forecasted to be only 490 m long after 100 years this plume is 33 shorter than the 730 m long plume predicted for a 10 m thick aquifer shown in table 3 third sites with fluctuating groundwater flow directions sometimes referred to as a fire hose effect will have shorter plume lengths than the assumed constant 1 dimensional groundwater flow direction assumed in the theoretical simulations this is due to the fact that there is a larger volume low k material into which the plume can diffuse fourth as newell et al 2020 noted that with respect to pfas the history of the contaminant transport field is more heavily weighted to underestimating the attenuation of emerging contaminants rather than overestimating it the current understanding of this non degrading compound class pfaas strongly indicates that these compounds are stable under ambient conditions however if future research shows that these compounds degrade even very slowly half lives of decades or centuries this could have a significant effect on the extent of long term pfaa plume migration in our modeling analysis for the general case of a slowly degrading groundwater constituent in an aquifer with base case conditions seepage velocity of 30 5 m per year retardation factor of 2 7 in the transmissive zone and a source concentration of 0 2 Œºg l a degradation half life of 10 years stabilizes plume length at approximately 100 m fifth sorption processes for emerging non degrading compounds such as pfaas are still being studied and future research could indicate that the simple linear isotherm approach used here is inadequate for modeling plume migration sixth the simulations in this paper do not consider the transformation of pfas precursors to pfaas like pfos at sites with significant precursor transformation in plumes the pfos plumes may behave differently from the results shown in this paper seventh diffusion of anionic non degrading groundwater constituents such as pfaas may have different matrix diffusion processes compared to conventional constituents such as chlorinated solvents schaefer et al 2021 described how a standard pore diffusion model with linear adsorption parameters substantially underpredicted matrix diffusion of six pfaas into a clay rich soil for pfas surface diffusion processes solute migration within mineral layers or other near surface electrical boundaries were about the same magnitude as conventional pore based diffusion schaefer et al 2021 notes that enhanced diffusion into low permeability clays would likely serve to mitigate downgradient pfaa attenuation based on this observation a simple conceptual experiment was performed as part of the current paper where the pfos molecular diffusion coefficient in the remchlor md base case was doubled to capture some form of enhanced diffusion however 100 year plume lengths shown in the base case in table 3 did not change substantially 0 to 12 reduction data not shown because both forward and back diffusion were enhanced in remchlor md however matrix diffusion non enhanced or enhanced with hysteretic desorption would likely result in higher true attenuation of the expanding pfos plume given these uncertainties this theoretical modeling exercise presented in this paper can be used to understand the general behavior of non degrading and recalcitrant plumes but may not be suitable for predicting plume behavior on a site specific basis as recommended by newell et al 2021b at any given site the actual behavior of the plume stable shrinking etc will require a site specific assessment 4 conclusions developing mna for non degrading groundwater constituents such as pfaas is important because currently there are no practical remediation technologies that have been shown to destroy pfaas in situ furthermore management of pfaa plumes using pump and treat systems is costly both in terms of finances and natural resource consumption with resultant poor sustainability metrics our key finding is that matrix diffusion is likely to be a very important attenuation process at many sites when modeling the migration of non degrading constituents in groundwater such as pfaas reducing the rate that the plume expands compared to a no matrix diffusion case in one 100 year travel time modeling scenario pfos migration with matrix diffusion resulted in a simulated plume length that was 81 shorter than plume length when modeled without matrix diffusion in addition matrix diffusion not only slows plume expansion for expanding plumes but also accelerates the slowdown in the annual plume expansion rate over decadal timescales in general a non degrading or recalcitrant compound may continue to expand until transverse dispersion processes effectively dilute the groundwater plume to concentrations below the relevant regulatory criterion however when a groundwater plume is expanding matrix diffusion can act as an effective peak shaving process that converts a strong signal mass discharge of the contaminant toward receptors to a much lower but longer lasting signal newell et al 2020 while the same amount of constituents may leave the source zone as a site not impacted by matrix diffusion the amount reaching potential receptors at concentrations above action levels may be less or even zero therefore the timescale of the retention processes and the general mass discharge vs time pattern in proximity to potential receptors will be important to consider with regard to the feasibility of mna for management of non degrading groundwater constituents sites where sorption and matrix diffusion processes slow or effectively stop the expansion of plumes of non degrading groundwater constituents could be good candidates for a retention based mna strategy as described by newell et al 2021a 2021b in this case a plume assimilative capacity zone in front of the existing plume could be reserved for future retention of an expanding non degrading plume similar to allowances for expanding plumes that are now in place under certain environmental

1323,in this study an inexact fractional programming method is employed for planning the regional scale water energy food nexus wefn system the ifp cannot only deal with uncertainties expressed as interval parameters but also handle conflicts among multiple decision stakeholders the ifp approach is then applied to planning the wefn system of henan province china an ifp wefn model has been established under consideration of various restrictions related to water and energy availability as well as food demand solutions of the planting areas for different crops in different periods have been generated the results suggested that there would be a significant increase for vegetable cultivation with an increasing rate of 24 4 and 30 respectively for the conservative and advantageous conditions followed by the fruit cultivation in comparison the planting area of cotton would be decreased with a decreasing rate of 21 2 and there would also be an explicit decrease for rice cultivation these results can help generate a desired planting scheme in order to achieve a maximized unit benefit with respect to the water utilization comparison between the ifp wefn model and the ilp wefn model indicates that even though a slightly lower benefit is obtained from ifp wenf model it can result in a higher unit benefit than the planting scheme from ilp wefn model consequently the ifp wefn model can help decision makers identify the sustainable agricultural water resources management schemes with a priority of water utilization efficiency graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords inexact fractional programming uncertainty water energy food nexus system decision making efficiency 1 introduction consumptions of water energy and food are accelerating due to rapid socio economic development booming population and increasing living standard such an issue cannot only be deemed as a general problem of administration but also come into being a large number of intricacies among water energy and food liu et al 2015 on the one hand food transport water treatment farming irrigation and water supply require energy to sustain while water resources can ensure stabilized energy generation normal crops growth processing and food production on the other hand food can also promote the development of virtual water trade and bioenergy liu et al 2015 shang et al 2018 however the challenge of ensuring water food and energy demands is expanding accompanied with the urbanization process das et al 2015 yu et al 2018 the deterioration of each factor may spread to other components and cause serious consequences the policy measure and security of water energy or food may break the fragile balance among the three resources through critical demand and supply mechanism keskinen et al 2016 owen et al 2018 therefore formulating a high efficiency and optimal allocation of water energy and food can both coordinate rapid development of various relevant departments and guarantee social stability and harmony martinez et al 2018 wang et al 2018 previously many research works were conducted to explore management strategies of water energy nexus wen water food nexus wfn and energy food nexus efn there are lots of studies based on the wen and water footprint theory perrone et al 2011 yu et al 2019 for example tsolas et al 2018 and liu et al 2019 employed a graphical and systematic program with the purpose of identifying and eliminating surplus from consumption and production of wen system salmoral and yan 2018 used the theory of virtual water and embedded energy to explore water and energy allocations in the economic system however those studies can hardly address extensive uncertainties existing in the water energy food nexus wefn system recently some studies have been proposed to reflect various uncertainties in the wefn system perrone et al 2011 georgiou et al 2018 tsolas et al 2018 liu et al 2019 yu et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 fan et al 2021 huang and fan 2021 lyu and fan 2021 for instance hussien et al 2018 developed a new approach based on risk analysis to address the uncertainties related to demand supply counterpoise and seasonal changes in the wefn system yu et al 2019 developed an interval possibilistic stochastic programming ipsp method for planning municipal scale mixed energy system under multiple uncertainties for the city of qingdao in shandong province china in addition to extensive uncertainties the management of wefn system is generally associated to multiple stakeholders which may have contradictory objectives there have been some studies to address contradictory objectives in the wefn system through different approaches for instance yue et al 2021 developed an inexact multi objective optimization approach for sustainable agricultural energy water food nexus ewfn management with objectives of social welfare hydroelectric generation grain crop production positive farmland ecosystem service value and negative farmland ecosystem service value s√°nchez zarco et al 2021 developed a multi objective mixed integer nonlinear programing model to meet water energy and food needs in an arid region involving security assessment also other multi objective optimization based studies to tackle multiple objectives in the wefn system can be found in yue and guo 2021 radmehr et al 2021 liu et al 2022 and so on in parallel with multi objective optimization approaches bi or multi level optimization approaches have been developed to reflect multiple objectives from different stakeholders in the wefn system for example yu et al 2020a proposed a multi level interval fuzzy credibility constrained programming mifcp method to deal with uncertainties and handle conflicts and hierarchical relationships among multiple decision departments in the wefn system jiang et al 2019 proposed a three level optimization coordination model for optimizing regional irrigation water allocation for multi stage pumping water irrigation system also many other studies can be found in li et al 2019 yu et al 2020b zuo et al 2021 and so on however both multi objective and multi level optimization approaches may be challenged in dealing with various objectives in the wefn system such as assigning different weights to different objectives in the multi objective approaches and pre defining the hierarchical structure in the multi level techniques consequently further studies are still required to explore trade offs among different objectives in the wefn system therefore this paper aims to propose an inexact fractional programming ifp method through coordinating interval linear programming ilp and fractional programming fp into one framework ifp integrates the unique contribution of each individual technique in which the ilp would be adopted to deal with various uncertainties and the fp would be employed to reflect conflicting objectives of the studied problem moreover an ifp wefn model is developed for planning the wefn system of henan province china the obtained results would be able to help the local governor generate desirable planting schemes for different crops with a number of restrictions such as water availability and pollution control energy availability and food demand 2 methodology 2 1 interval linear programming ilp interval values are allowed to be incorporated into the optimization process in ilp all parameters and decision variables in a linear programming can be intervals huang et al 1992 specifically an ilp model can be defined as follows 1a max f c x subject to 1b a x b 1c x 0 wherea r m n c r 1 n b r m 1 x r n 1 r denotes a set of interval numbers a a ij m n c c 1 c 2 c n b b 1 b 2 b m t and x x 1 x 2 x n t an interval number a is defined as huang et al 1992 a a a t a a t a an interactive solution algorithm named two step method tsm was proposed to solve the problem huang et al 1992 1995 fan and huang 2012 fan et al 2009 2012 interval solutions can be obtained based on the analysis of detailed interrelationships between the parameters and variables and between the objective function and constraints the main idea of tsm is to convert the original ilp model into two lp submodels corresponding to the lower and upper bounds of the objective function value respectively 2 2 factional programming a fp model can be an effective tool to deal with ratio optimization problems where the objective function is the quotient of two functions e g cost evacuee and cost time the method can thus be used for tackling two objective programming problems without the risk of weighting these objectives it has been widely used in a number of fields such as resource management finance production and transportation a fp model can be expressed as follows zhu et al 2014 2a max f x cx Œ± dx Œ≤ subject to 2b x s 2c s x ax b x 0 where a is an m n matrix x and b are column vectors with n and m components respectively c and d are row vectors with n components Œ± and Œ≤ are constants if the denominator is constant in sign for all x on the feasible region the fp model can be optimized by solving a linear programming program charnes and cooper 1962 it is also assumed that dx Œ≤ 0 for all x in s the objective function is continuously differentiable and set s is regular non empty and bounded 2 3 inexact fractional programming the inexact fractional programming ifp is developed in this study to deal with controversial objective targets as well as uncertainties existing in wefn systems it integrates fp ilp into a general framework in which the fp is employed to reflect trade offs between controversial conflicting targets and ilp is used to deal with uncertainty parameters expressed as interval numbers in general the ifp model can be expressed as 3a max f j 1 n c j x j Œ± j 1 n d j x j Œ≤ subject to 3b j 1 n a ij x j b i i 1 2 m based on the interactive transform algorithm proposed by zhu et al 2014 model 3 can be transformed into two conventional fractional programming submodels corresponding to the low and upper bound of the objective the first submodel corresponds to the lower bound i e f of the objective which is formulated as follows i e submodel i 4a max f j 1 k c j x j j k 1 n c j x j Œ± j 1 k d j x j j k 1 n d j x j Œ≤ subject to 4b j 1 k a ij sign a ij x j j k 1 n a ij sign a ij x j b i i 1 2 m 4c x j 0 j 1 2 k 4d x j 0 j k 1 k 2 n the second submodel corresponds to the upper bound f of the objective function which is formulated as i e submodel ii 5a max f j 1 k c j x j j k 1 n c j x j Œ± j 1 k d j x j j k 1 n d j x j Œ≤ 5b j 1 k a ij sign a ij x j j k 1 n a ij sign a ij x j b i i 1 2 m 5c j 1 r i a ij x j j r i 1 k a ij x j j k 1 k t i a ij x jopt j k t i 1 n a ij x j b i i 1 2 m 5d x j 0 j 1 2 k 5e x j x jopt j 1 2 k 5f x j 0 j k 1 k 2 n 5g x j x jopt j k 1 k 2 n in model 3 and its two submodels i e submodel i numbered as model 4 submodel ii numbered as model 5 the former k k n coefficients for c j and d j are assumed to be positive i e 0 c j c j and 0 d j d j for a simplicity purpose and the latter n k coefficients for c j and d j are assumed to be negative consequently to get the lower bound i e f of the objective function in model 3 the former k k n variables i e x j j 1 2 k would get there lower bounds i e x j j 1 2 k correspondingly and the latter variables would get their upper bounds i e x j j k 1 k 2 n as presented in eq 4a zhu et al 2014 for the constraints of model 3 presented in constraint 3b the conservative constraints are to be employed for the submodel corresponding to lower bound i e f of the objective function and thus b i is adopted in submodel i in comparison relatively looser constraints i e b i would be used in the submodel corresponding to upper bound i e f of the objective function as presented in constraints 5b and 5c detailed proof for the formulation of the two submodels can be found in relevant literatures huang et al 1995 fan and huang 2012 for submodel i the solutions x jopt j 1 2 k and x jopt j k 1 k 2 n are obtained which would be used to formulate additional constraints eqs 5e and 5g in submodel ii in addition r i and t i stand for the numbers of a ij 0 or a sj 0 respectively associated with decision variables x j j 1 2 k and x j j k 1 k 2 n for constraint i or s models 4 and 5 are conventional fraction programming problems which can be solved through the method proposed by charnes and cooper 1962 thus the final solutions for model 3 can be obtained as follows 6a f f opt f opt 6b x jopt x jopt x jopt the ifp based approaches have been applied for a number of environmental management problems such as planning of regional energy systems zhu et al 2014 agricultural water management tan and zhang 2018 carbon emission management of urban agglomeration cao et al 2021 allocation of irrigation water resources ren et al 2019 and crop biomass coproduction management ji et al 2020 in this study the ifp approach will be applied to support management of a provincial water energy food nexus system under consideration of utilization efficiency of water resources 3 application 3 1 overview of the study area as shown in fig 1 henan province is located in the middle east part of china which has a largest population over 100 million four water systems including the yellow river huaihe river haihe river and yangtze river flow across the province with about 1500 tributaries in total the province has an area of 167 103 km2 accounting for 1 73 of the country s total area however the population would account for 7 8 of the country s total population henan province is covered with complex terrains and landforms but about 55 7 of its area is characterized as plains and basins such a feature provides favorable conditions for agricultural activities as a major agricultural province henan province is an important production area of wheat sesame corn cotton and soybean in china in the last few decades the value of agricultural production has increased gradually for instance the total value of agricultural production has ranged from rmb 0 225 1012 2007 to 0 455 1012 2017 which has a percentage improvement of 102 5 while it encounters the bottleneck states in recent years there are rmb 0 450 1012 2015 0 446 1012 2016 and 0 455 1012 2017 data show that the trend of sustained growth has vanished and tended to be stable in future therefore as an vital part of gross domestic product gdp it is essential to further increase the output value of agriculture through adjusting crop planting structure under the consideration of various production factors at present the main problems of agricultural development in henan province can be divided into the following aspects a the amount of water resources for irrigation is numerous while its utilization efficiency is low and leads to serious waste for instance the total utilization water amount for agriculture is 10 9 109 m3 in 2017 which accounts for 46 8 of the total water consumption the average amount of water applied in henan province is 2389 m3 hm2 which is higher than the level of developed countries and the national average the main reasons for this state are extensive use of water imperfect irrigation facilities and lake of unified management b the total energy production decreases with years and the electricity consumption in rural areas has an opposite tendency which means agricultural electricity distribution needs to be reduced specifically data shows that the total energy production has a decrease ratio of 42 1 from 2010 to 2017 however electricity consumption in rural areas has increased from 26 9 109 kwh to 32 9 109 kwh which has an increase ratio of 22 3 c the planting structure of crops is unreasonable and need to plan scientifically according to the statistical bulletin of 2018 the planting areas of wheat oil bearing crops and peanut are 5 74 103 1 46 103 and 1 20 103 hm2 compared with the planting areas in 2017 the increase proportion are 0 4 4 6 and 4 4 respectively conversely the planting areas of corn cotton and vegetables have decrease proportions of 2 1 10 0 and 0 9 data shows that the planting structure of crops would be adjusted under the market regulation while many factors e g environmental pollution and energy shortage have been ignored d there have been amounts of consumption for production conditions which has resulted in serious pollution from non point sources as a typical non point source pollution many research studies have been conducted on the pollution of farmland nowadays pollution sources are mainly divided into three categories i e chemical fertilizer pesticide and plastic film and the consumption of them have a trend of improvement for increasing the agricultural output in the last few years for instance the consumption of chemical fertilizer pesticides and plastic film were 5 70 109 0 118 109 and 0 13 109 kg in 2007 while 7 07 109 0 121 109 and 0 16 109 kg in 2017 the use of these three production elements would not only lead to a large emission of nitrogen and phosphorus but also its residues would pollute the water soil and air which could break the ecological balance although the consumption of them have been decreasing in recent years its unit consumption still far exceeds the international standard according to the 13th five year plan we will accelerate the transformation of the pattern of agricultural development and implement the village cleaning project which need to strengthen the treatment and repair of major soil pollution strengthen the prevention and control of non point source pollution in agriculture accelerate the comprehensive improvement of rural environment and ensure the overall stability of soil environmental quality in the province fphpeep the 13th five year plan of henan province for ecological and environmental protection 2017 therefore in the overall planning of agricultural development it is essential to consider agricultural pollution i e the consumption of three production conditions in order to realize the coordination between planting agriculture and ecological agriculture as well as promote the sustainable development of agriculture 3 2 ifp wefn modeling formulation government departments have formulated relevant documents for controlling pollutant discharge standards in order to mitigate and control environmental pollution caused by agricultural productions however for a real world wefn system there are multiple components and multiple uncertainties in association with different decision makers preferences there are many uncertain technical and economic parameters in the production and processing of agriculture besides the management of wefn system not only considers the profit of the entire wefn system but also balances the contradiction among agricultural water and energy resources managers according to different decision making priorities based on the ifp method an ifp wefn model as presented in fig 2 is established for planning the wefn system of henan province china in the ifp wefn model agriculture activities i e crop cultivation crop processing food generation food transportation and available resources control i e fertilizer utilization pesticide utilization energy consumption for farming water consumption for irrigation are considered to achieve a maximized system benefit in detail nine crops would be considered in the ifp wefn model including rice wheat corn beans tubers oil bearing cotton vegetables and fruits also a planning horizon of 6 years is considered in the developed model covering 2022 2027 consequently the objective of the ifp wefn model is to maximize the unit benefit which is defined as the agriculture profit per water consumption m3 the agriculture profits include revenue of crops and the cost used for the consumption of various resources e g water fertilizer

constraints e g limited utilization amount of land and electricity which could be clearly seen as follows the constraints can help plan the agricultural development of henan province alleviate the contradictions among the development of socio economic environmental protection and other aspects which will ultimately realize the sustainable development the constraints are 1 the excessive exploitation of land for agriculture may lead to negative effects e g ecological environment deterioration and soil erosion which means cultivated area should be restricted constraint 8a limited the

t are estimated through regression methods based on these historical data presented in table 2 interval solutions would be obtained through the developed ifp wefn model in which the lower bounds would correspond to conservative demanding conditions i e the lower bound of objective function whilst the upper bounds would correspond to the advantageous conditions i e the upper bound of objective function 4 result analysis based on the constraints e g environmental protection and limited resource utilization and the objective of maximum unit benefit the planting areas of different crops during the planning periods could be obtained by solving the ifp model as shown in fig 3 and table 4 fig 3 clearly shows crops planting areas and the corresponding variation trends during the planning periods which would further help the decision makers to formulate and implement scientific planning schemes it can be seen that the planting areas for different crops would vary in different planning periods due to the socioeconomic and environmental restrictions in detail the planting areas for rice corn beans tubers show a slightly decreasing trend while in comparison there would be slightly more planting areas for wheat oil bearing crops for instance the planting area for rice would be 5248 5563 km2 in period 1 and 4916 5211 km2 in period 6 this means that the planting area for rice would decrease from 5248 km2 to 4916 km2 under the demanding conditions i e corresponding to the lower bound of the objective function and from 5563 km2 to 5211 km2 under advantageous conditions i e corresponding to the upper bound of the objective function which showed a decreasing rate of 6 8 for both conditions in comparison cultivation area for wheat would respectively be 43 405 46 010 and 43 524 46 136 km2 in periods 1 and 6 exhibiting an increasing rate of 0 3 for both demanding and advantageous conditions in addition it can be found from fig 3 and table 4 there would be noticeable increases in the planting areas for vegetables and fruits while apparent decreasing for the planting area of cotton the planting area for vegetables would be 14 013 14 854 and 18 522 21 194 km2 in periods 1 and 6 leading to increasing rate of 24 4 and 30 for its lower and upper bounds the cultivation areas for fruit and cotton also respectively present an increasing rate of 9 6 and a decreasing rate of 21 2 these may be due to the fact that more vegetables and fruits are demanded towards to the healthy life in future moreover as the uncertainty presented in various parameters the obtained planting areas for the crops also fluctuate within certain ranges these results can help decision makers make tradeoff between advantageous and conservative conditions in study area the contradiction between water using departments is increasingly prominent due to the acceleration of industrialization wasteful use of irrigation water and improvement of living standards specifically the water utilization would increase during the whole planning horizon in which the water demand would be 1 01 1 03 1011 m3 in period 1 and 1 06 1 09 1011 m3 in period 6 showing increasing rates of 4 3 and 6 2 for its lower and upper bounds fig 4 presents the water demands for all crops in different time periods we can notice that the significant increase for water demand occurs in period 3 this may be attributed to the noticeable increase in the planting area for vegetables as shown in fig 3 h fig 5 depicts the detailed proportion for water demand by different crops in different planning periods it can be seen that the wheat would utilize most irrigation water with a proportion more than 40 followed by the vegetables being allocated around 18 in period 1 but more than 22 after period 2 moreover the irrigation consumption amounts for rice corn and oil bearing crops have similar proportions around 10 for the water allocation proportions for specific crops in different planning periods it is noticed that all water allocation proportions except vegetables and fruits would show a slightly decreasing trend even though the cultivation areas for wheat and oil bearing crops would increase during the planning horizon for instance the water allocation proportion for wheat would be 43 2 in period 1 and 40 3 41 1 in period 6 this would mainly be attributed to the significant increase for water consumption for vegetables in which its water allocation proportion increases from 18 7 in period 1 to 23 5 24 9 in period 6 in terms of the proportion for water demand from fruits it would slightly increase due to the increasing cultivation area in periods 1 and 2 but would decrease due to the competitive demand from vegetables moreover even though there are visible uncertainties in the planting areas for different crops in different periods these uncertainties would not significantly influence the water allocation proportions leading to limited fluctuation ranges for the proportion values in addition to water resources to support crop growing energies such as electricity or fossil energy are required in agricultural activities such as machinery and irrigation fig 6 presents the energy utilizations for different crop cultivation in different time periods in which the purple and red bars respectively represent the energy allocation proportions under the demanding i e lower bound of the objective function and advantageous i e the upper bound of the objective function conditions it is noticed that cultivation of wheat would be the prioritized energy user which would consume more than 35 energies allocated to all agricultural activities this is similar with the utilization of water resources however even though less than 10 water resources would be distributed to corn cultivation this kind of crop would utilize more than 20 of energies just followed the energy consumption of wheat cultivation this is because that the energy utilization is directly associated with the cultivation areas for different crops and corn would have the second largest planting area as presented in table 4 due to this fact the energy usage pattern is different from the water utilization which is affected by both water availabilities as well as the unit water consumption for different crops 5 discussion the objective of the ifp wefn model is to achieve a maximized unit benefit for the agriculture department with respect to the water consumption which is different from traditional wefn model aiming to maximize the total benefit of the agricultural department table 5 presents the planting crop areas for different crops in different time periods generated from an ilp wefn model the planting scheme from ilp wefn model would be different from that generated by the ifp wefn model for instance the planting areas for vegetables from the ilp wefn model would be 16 518 17 394 and 15 453 18 551 km2 in periods 1 and 2 while in comparison the planting areas from ifp wefn model would respectively be 14 013 14 854 and 14 089 14 934 km2 in periods 1 and 2 this suggests that maximizing the total system benefit would not necessarily lead to a maximum unit benefit fig 7 shows the total benefit of the agricultural department obtained from the ifp wefn and ilp wefn models the results show that the total benefit from ifp wefn model would slightly lower than that from ilp wefn model in detail the total benefit obtained from ifp wefn model would range within 2 32 2 84 1012 rmb while the total benefit from ilp wefn model fluctuates within 2 35 2 85 1012 rmb this is due to the difference in the objective for those two models fig 8 presents the unit benefits obtained from the ifp wefn and ilp wefn models conversely with the total benefit the unit benefit from ifp wefn model would higher than that from ilp wefn model the unit benefit of ifp wefn model would range within 37 1 44 1 rmb m3 while the unit benefit from ilp wefn model would change within 36 5 43 4 rmb m3 due to the uncertainties in model parameters these results indicate that the planting scheme from ifp wefn model would be more appropriate with a priority of water utilization efficiency while the scheme from ilp wefn model would be adopted for a purpose of maximizing the system benefit in this study the contradictory objectives between system benefits and water consumption were reflected through a fractional objective compared with traditional ilp wefn model the proposed ifp wefn model would give priority to the unit system benefit with respect to water utilization rather than the total system benefit therefore higher unit benefits would be generated by the ifp wefn model i e 37 1 44 1 rmb m3 which can enhance the utilization efficiency of water resources this is particularly meaningful for henan province which is one of the most water scarce regions in china moreover the introduction of fractional programming into the ifp wefn model can also have merits in tackling contradictory objectives than other relevant approaches such as bi level or multi level programming methods in i avoiding priority pre specification among those two objectives and ii relative simple solution procedures xu et al 2022 6 conclusions in this study an inexact fractional programming ifp method has been adopted to provide management strategies for the complex water energy food nexus wefn system an ifp wefn model has been formulated for planning the wefn system of henan province solutions of the planting areas for different crops under different periods have been generated in order to achieve a maximized unit benefit with respect to the water utilization the solutions obtained from the ifp wefn model is subject to maximizing the utilization efficiency of water resources which would tend to approach sustainable water resources management the results indicated that among the nine crops the planting areas for rice corn beans tubers and cotton would decrease while the other four crops namely wheat oil bearing crops vegetables and fruits would have more planting areas more specifically the planting area for vegetables would significantly increase leading to a noticeable decrease in the planting area for cotton moreover the water demand for most crops would decrease over the planning horizon due to the remarkable increase for the water demand from the vegetables compared with the ifp wefn model the ilp wefn model merely consider the total system benefit and thus leads to a different planting scheme for the henan province the results suggest that the unit benefit from ifp wefn model would higher than that from ilp wefn model even though the total benefit from ilp wefn model is slightly lower the obtained results for the ifp wefn model can support further planting schemes in henan province from a perspective of sustainable water resources management the henan province is recommended to reduce the cultivation area for rice and corn but at the same time increase wheat planting to satisfy the local demand of cereals in addition due to the realization of the healthy life more fruits and vegetables will be needed which lead to increasing trends for the cultivation areas of these two crops especially after 2023 correspondingly some crops would be less planted due to the limited availability of arable lands in which the plant area of cotton would be decreased most significantly the ifp wefn model could deal with contradictions among various objectives under uncertainty however in real world wefn management problems the flow of natural surface water may be affected by a variety of factors from climate topographic and other aspects showing various uncertainties in different formats such as fuzzy sets and random variables therefore further studies are required to deal with multiple uncertainties in the wefn system besides only one water resource i e surface water were considered in this study consequently further studies are required to include other water resources such as groundwater diverted water and reclaimed water as well as to reveal the effect of consumption change of water for agriculture to other consumption such a challenge can be addressed through integrating factorial analysis method into the ifp wefn model credit authorship contribution statement kai huang methodology code

1323,in this study an inexact fractional programming method is employed for planning the regional scale water energy food nexus wefn system the ifp cannot only deal with uncertainties expressed as interval parameters but also handle conflicts among multiple decision stakeholders the ifp approach is then applied to planning the wefn system of henan province china an ifp wefn model has been established under consideration of various restrictions related to water and energy availability as well as food demand solutions of the planting areas for different crops in different periods have been generated the results suggested that there would be a significant increase for vegetable cultivation with an increasing rate of 24 4 and 30 respectively for the conservative and advantageous conditions followed by the fruit cultivation in comparison the planting area of cotton would be decreased with a decreasing rate of 21 2 and there would also be an explicit decrease for rice cultivation these results can help generate a desired planting scheme in order to achieve a maximized unit benefit with respect to the water utilization comparison between the ifp wefn model and the ilp wefn model indicates that even though a slightly lower benefit is obtained from ifp wenf model it can result in a higher unit benefit than the planting scheme from ilp wefn model consequently the ifp wefn model can help decision makers identify the sustainable agricultural water resources management schemes with a priority of water utilization efficiency graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords inexact fractional programming uncertainty water energy food nexus system decision making efficiency 1 introduction consumptions of water energy and food are accelerating due to rapid socio economic development booming population and increasing living standard such an issue cannot only be deemed as a general problem of administration but also come into being a large number of intricacies among water energy and food liu et al 2015 on the one hand food transport water treatment farming irrigation and water supply require energy to sustain while water resources can ensure stabilized energy generation normal crops growth processing and food production on the other hand food can also promote the development of virtual water trade and bioenergy liu et al 2015 shang et al 2018 however the challenge of ensuring water food and energy demands is expanding accompanied with the urbanization process das et al 2015 yu et al 2018 the deterioration of each factor may spread to other components and cause serious consequences the policy measure and security of water energy or food may break the fragile balance among the three resources through critical demand and supply mechanism keskinen et al 2016 owen et al 2018 therefore formulating a high efficiency and optimal allocation of water energy and food can both coordinate rapid development of various relevant departments and guarantee social stability and harmony martinez et al 2018 wang et al 2018 previously many research works were conducted to explore management strategies of water energy nexus wen water food nexus wfn and energy food nexus efn there are lots of studies based on the wen and water footprint theory perrone et al 2011 yu et al 2019 for example tsolas et al 2018 and liu et al 2019 employed a graphical and systematic program with the purpose of identifying and eliminating surplus from consumption and production of wen system salmoral and yan 2018 used the theory of virtual water and embedded energy to explore water and energy allocations in the economic system however those studies can hardly address extensive uncertainties existing in the water energy food nexus wefn system recently some studies have been proposed to reflect various uncertainties in the wefn system perrone et al 2011 georgiou et al 2018 tsolas et al 2018 liu et al 2019 yu et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 fan et al 2021 huang and fan 2021 lyu and fan 2021 for instance hussien et al 2018 developed a new approach based on risk analysis to address the uncertainties related to demand supply counterpoise and seasonal changes in the wefn system yu et al 2019 developed an interval possibilistic stochastic programming ipsp method for planning municipal scale mixed energy system under multiple uncertainties for the city of qingdao in shandong province china in addition to extensive uncertainties the management of wefn system is generally associated to multiple stakeholders which may have contradictory objectives there have been some studies to address contradictory objectives in the wefn system through different approaches for instance yue et al 2021 developed an inexact multi objective optimization approach for sustainable agricultural energy water food nexus ewfn management with objectives of social welfare hydroelectric generation grain crop production positive farmland ecosystem service value and negative farmland ecosystem service value s√°nchez zarco et al 2021 developed a multi objective mixed integer nonlinear programing model to meet water energy and food needs in an arid region involving security assessment also other multi objective optimization based studies to tackle multiple objectives in the wefn system can be found in yue and guo 2021 radmehr et al 2021 liu et al 2022 and so on in parallel with multi objective optimization approaches bi or multi level optimization approaches have been developed to reflect multiple objectives from different stakeholders in the wefn system for example yu et al 2020a proposed a multi level interval fuzzy credibility constrained programming mifcp method to deal with uncertainties and handle conflicts and hierarchical relationships among multiple decision departments in the wefn system jiang et al 2019 proposed a three level optimization coordination model for optimizing regional irrigation water allocation for multi stage pumping water irrigation system also many other studies can be found in li et al 2019 yu et al 2020b zuo et al 2021 and so on however both multi objective and multi level optimization approaches may be challenged in dealing with various objectives in the wefn system such as assigning different weights to different objectives in the multi objective approaches and pre defining the hierarchical structure in the multi level techniques consequently further studies are still required to explore trade offs among different objectives in the wefn system therefore this paper aims to propose an inexact fractional programming ifp method through coordinating interval linear programming ilp and fractional programming fp into one framework ifp integrates the unique contribution of each individual technique in which the ilp would be adopted to deal with various uncertainties and the fp would be employed to reflect conflicting objectives of the studied problem moreover an ifp wefn model is developed for planning the wefn system of henan province china the obtained results would be able to help the local governor generate desirable planting schemes for different crops with a number of restrictions such as water availability and pollution control energy availability and food demand 2 methodology 2 1 interval linear programming ilp interval values are allowed to be incorporated into the optimization process in ilp all parameters and decision variables in a linear programming can be intervals huang et al 1992 specifically an ilp model can be defined as follows 1a max f c x subject to 1b a x b 1c x 0 wherea r m n c r 1 n b r m 1 x r n 1 r denotes a set of interval numbers a a ij m n c c 1 c 2 c n b b 1 b 2 b m t and x x 1 x 2 x n t an interval number a is defined as huang et al 1992 a a a t a a t a an interactive solution algorithm named two step method tsm was proposed to solve the problem huang et al 1992 1995 fan and huang 2012 fan et al 2009 2012 interval solutions can be obtained based on the analysis of detailed interrelationships between the parameters and variables and between the objective function and constraints the main idea of tsm is to convert the original ilp model into two lp submodels corresponding to the lower and upper bounds of the objective function value respectively 2 2 factional programming a fp model can be an effective tool to deal with ratio optimization problems where the objective function is the quotient of two functions e g cost evacuee and cost time the method can thus be used for tackling two objective programming problems without the risk of weighting these objectives it has been widely used in a number of fields such as resource management finance production and transportation a fp model can be expressed as follows zhu et al 2014 2a max f x cx Œ± dx Œ≤ subject to 2b x s 2c s x ax b x 0 where a is an m n matrix x and b are column vectors with n and m components respectively c and d are row vectors with n components Œ± and Œ≤ are constants if the denominator is constant in sign for all x on the feasible region the fp model can be optimized by solving a linear programming program charnes and cooper 1962 it is also assumed that dx Œ≤ 0 for all x in s the objective function is continuously differentiable and set s is regular non empty and bounded 2 3 inexact fractional programming the inexact fractional programming ifp is developed in this study to deal with controversial objective targets as well as uncertainties existing in wefn systems it integrates fp ilp into a general framework in which the fp is employed to reflect trade offs between controversial conflicting targets and ilp is used to deal with uncertainty parameters expressed as interval numbers in general the ifp model can be expressed as 3a max f j 1 n c j x j Œ± j 1 n d j x j Œ≤ subject to 3b j 1 n a ij x j b i i 1 2 m based on the interactive transform algorithm proposed by zhu et al 2014 model 3 can be transformed into two conventional fractional programming submodels corresponding to the low and upper bound of the objective the first submodel corresponds to the lower bound i e f of the objective which is formulated as follows i e submodel i 4a max f j 1 k c j x j j k 1 n c j x j Œ± j 1 k d j x j j k 1 n d j x j Œ≤ subject to 4b j 1 k a ij sign a ij x j j k 1 n a ij sign a ij x j b i i 1 2 m 4c x j 0 j 1 2 k 4d x j 0 j k 1 k 2 n the second submodel corresponds to the upper bound f of the objective function which is formulated as i e submodel ii 5a max f j 1 k c j x j j k 1 n c j x j Œ± j 1 k d j x j j k 1 n d j x j Œ≤ 5b j 1 k a ij sign a ij x j j k 1 n a ij sign a ij x j b i i 1 2 m 5c j 1 r i a ij x j j r i 1 k a ij x j j k 1 k t i a ij x jopt j k t i 1 n a ij x j b i i 1 2 m 5d x j 0 j 1 2 k 5e x j x jopt j 1 2 k 5f x j 0 j k 1 k 2 n 5g x j x jopt j k 1 k 2 n in model 3 and its two submodels i e submodel i numbered as model 4 submodel ii numbered as model 5 the former k k n coefficients for c j and d j are assumed to be positive i e 0 c j c j and 0 d j d j for a simplicity purpose and the latter n k coefficients for c j and d j are assumed to be negative consequently to get the lower bound i e f of the objective function in model 3 the former k k n variables i e x j j 1 2 k would get there lower bounds i e x j j 1 2 k correspondingly and the latter variables would get their upper bounds i e x j j k 1 k 2 n as presented in eq 4a zhu et al 2014 for the constraints of model 3 presented in constraint 3b the conservative constraints are to be employed for the submodel corresponding to lower bound i e f of the objective function and thus b i is adopted in submodel i in comparison relatively looser constraints i e b i would be used in the submodel corresponding to upper bound i e f of the objective function as presented in constraints 5b and 5c detailed proof for the formulation of the two submodels can be found in relevant literatures huang et al 1995 fan and huang 2012 for submodel i the solutions x jopt j 1 2 k and x jopt j k 1 k 2 n are obtained which would be used to formulate additional constraints eqs 5e and 5g in submodel ii in addition r i and t i stand for the numbers of a ij 0 or a sj 0 respectively associated with decision variables x j j 1 2 k and x j j k 1 k 2 n for constraint i or s models 4 and 5 are conventional fraction programming problems which can be solved through the method proposed by charnes and cooper 1962 thus the final solutions for model 3 can be obtained as follows 6a f f opt f opt 6b x jopt x jopt x jopt the ifp based approaches have been applied for a number of environmental management problems such as planning of regional energy systems zhu et al 2014 agricultural water management tan and zhang 2018 carbon emission management of urban agglomeration cao et al 2021 allocation of irrigation water resources ren et al 2019 and crop biomass coproduction management ji et al 2020 in this study the ifp approach will be applied to support management of a provincial water energy food nexus system under consideration of utilization efficiency of water resources 3 application 3 1 overview of the study area as shown in fig 1 henan province is located in the middle east part of china which has a largest population over 100 million four water systems including the yellow river huaihe river haihe river and yangtze river flow across the province with about 1500 tributaries in total the province has an area of 167 103 km2 accounting for 1 73 of the country s total area however the population would account for 7 8 of the country s total population henan province is covered with complex terrains and landforms but about 55 7 of its area is characterized as plains and basins such a feature provides favorable conditions for agricultural activities as a major agricultural province henan province is an important production area of wheat sesame corn cotton and soybean in china in the last few decades the value of agricultural production has increased gradually for instance the total value of agricultural production has ranged from rmb 0 225 1012 2007 to 0 455 1012 2017 which has a percentage improvement of 102 5 while it encounters the bottleneck states in recent years there are rmb 0 450 1012 2015 0 446 1012 2016 and 0 455 1012 2017 data show that the trend of sustained growth has vanished and tended to be stable in future therefore as an vital part of gross domestic product gdp it is essential to further increase the output value of agriculture through adjusting crop planting structure under the consideration of various production factors at present the main problems of agricultural development in henan province can be divided into the following aspects a the amount of water resources for irrigation is numerous while its utilization efficiency is low and leads to serious waste for instance the total utilization water amount for agriculture is 10 9 109 m3 in 2017 which accounts for 46 8 of the total water consumption the average amount of water applied in henan province is 2389 m3 hm2 which is higher than the level of developed countries and the national average the main reasons for this state are extensive use of water imperfect irrigation facilities and lake of unified management b the total energy production decreases with years and the electricity consumption in rural areas has an opposite tendency which means agricultural electricity distribution needs to be reduced specifically data shows that the total energy production has a decrease ratio of 42 1 from 2010 to 2017 however electricity consumption in rural areas has increased from 26 9 109 kwh to 32 9 109 kwh which has an increase ratio of 22 3 c the planting structure of crops is unreasonable and need to plan scientifically according to the statistical bulletin of 2018 the planting areas of wheat oil bearing crops and peanut are 5 74 103 1 46 103 and 1 20 103 hm2 compared with the planting areas in 2017 the increase proportion are 0 4 4 6 and 4 4 respectively conversely the planting areas of corn cotton and vegetables have decrease proportions of 2 1 10 0 and 0 9 data shows that the planting structure of crops would be adjusted under the market regulation while many factors e g environmental pollution and energy shortage have been ignored d there have been amounts of consumption for production conditions which has resulted in serious pollution from non point sources as a typical non point source pollution many research studies have been conducted on the pollution of farmland nowadays pollution sources are mainly divided into three categories i e chemical fertilizer pesticide and plastic film and the consumption of them have a trend of improvement for increasing the agricultural output in the last few years for instance the consumption of chemical fertilizer pesticides and plastic film were 5 70 109 0 118 109 and 0 13 109 kg in 2007 while 7 07 109 0 121 109 and 0 16 109 kg in 2017 the use of these three production elements would not only lead to a large emission of nitrogen and phosphorus but also its residues would pollute the water soil and air which could break the ecological balance although the consumption of them have been decreasing in recent years its unit consumption still far exceeds the international standard according to the 13th five year plan we will accelerate the transformation of the pattern of agricultural development and implement the village cleaning project which need to strengthen the treatment and repair of major soil pollution strengthen the prevention and control of non point source pollution in agriculture accelerate the comprehensive improvement of rural environment and ensure the overall stability of soil environmental quality in the province fphpeep the 13th five year plan of henan province for ecological and environmental protection 2017 therefore in the overall planning of agricultural development it is essential to consider agricultural pollution i e the consumption of three production conditions in order to realize the coordination between planting agriculture and ecological agriculture as well as promote the sustainable development of agriculture 3 2 ifp wefn modeling formulation government departments have formulated relevant documents for controlling pollutant discharge standards in order to mitigate and control environmental pollution caused by agricultural productions however for a real world wefn system there are multiple components and multiple uncertainties in association with different decision makers preferences there are many uncertain technical and economic parameters in the production and processing of agriculture besides the management of wefn system not only considers the profit of the entire wefn system but also balances the contradiction among agricultural water and energy resources managers according to different decision making priorities based on the ifp method an ifp wefn model as presented in fig 2 is established for planning the wefn system of henan province china in the ifp wefn model agriculture activities i e crop cultivation crop processing food generation food transportation and available resources control i e fertilizer utilization pesticide utilization energy consumption for farming water consumption for irrigation are considered to achieve a maximized system benefit in detail nine crops would be considered in the ifp wefn model including rice wheat corn beans tubers oil bearing cotton vegetables and fruits also a planning horizon of 6 years is considered in the developed model covering 2022 2027 consequently the objective of the ifp wefn model is to maximize the unit benefit which is defined as the agriculture profit per water consumption m3 the agriculture profits include revenue of crops and the cost used for the consumption of various resources e g water fertilizer

constraints e g limited utilization amount of land and electricity which could be clearly seen as follows the constraints can help plan the agricultural development of henan province alleviate the contradictions among the development of socio economic environmental protection and other aspects which will ultimately realize the sustainable development the constraints are 1 the excessive exploitation of land for agriculture may lead to negative effects e g ecological environment deterioration and soil erosion which means cultivated area should be restricted constraint 8a limited the

correspond to conservative demanding conditions i e the lower bound of objective function whilst the upper bounds would correspond to the advantageous conditions i e the upper bound of objective function 4 result analysis based on the constraints e g environmental protection and limited resource utilization and the objective of maximum unit benefit the planting areas of different crops during the planning periods could be obtained by solving the ifp model as shown in fig 3 and table 4 fig 3 clearly shows crops planting areas and the corresponding variation trends during the planning periods which would further help the decision makers to formulate and implement scientific planning schemes it can be seen that the planting areas for different crops would vary in different planning periods due to the socioeconomic and environmental restrictions in detail the planting areas for rice corn beans tubers show a slightly decreasing trend while in comparison there would be slightly more planting areas for wheat oil bearing crops for instance the planting area for rice would be 5248 5563 km2 in period 1 and 4916 5211 km2 in period 6 this means that the planting area for rice would decrease from 5248 km2 to 4916 km2 under the demanding conditions i e corresponding to the lower bound of the objective function and from 5563 km2 to 5211 km2 under advantageous conditions i e corresponding to the upper bound of the objective function which showed a decreasing rate of 6 8 for both conditions in comparison cultivation area for wheat would respectively be 43 405 46 010 and 43 524 46 136 km2 in periods 1 and 6 exhibiting an increasing rate of 0 3 for both demanding and advantageous conditions in addition it can be found from fig 3 and table 4 there would be noticeable increases in the planting areas for vegetables and fruits while apparent decreasing for the planting area of cotton the planting area for vegetables would be 14 013 14 854 and 18 522 21 194 km2 in periods 1 and 6 leading to increasing rate of 24 4 and 30 for its lower and upper bounds the cultivation areas for fruit and cotton also respectively present an increasing rate of 9 6 and a decreasing rate of 21 2 these may be due to the fact that more vegetables and fruits are demanded towards to the healthy life in future moreover as the uncertainty presented in various parameters the obtained planting areas for the crops also fluctuate within certain ranges these results can help decision makers make tradeoff between advantageous and conservative conditions in study area the contradiction between water using departments is increasingly prominent due to the acceleration of industrialization wasteful use of irrigation water and improvement of living standards specifically the water utilization would increase during the whole planning horizon in which the water demand would be 1 01 1 03 1011 m3 in period 1 and 1 06 1 09 1011 m3 in period 6 showing increasing rates of 4 3 and 6 2 for its lower and upper bounds fig 4 presents the water demands for all crops in different time periods we can notice that the significant increase for water demand occurs in period 3 this may be attributed to the noticeable increase in the planting area for vegetables as shown in fig 3 h fig 5 depicts the detailed proportion for water demand by different crops in different planning periods it can be seen that the wheat would utilize most irrigation water with a proportion more than 40 followed by the vegetables being allocated around 18 in period 1 but more than 22 after period 2 moreover the irrigation consumption amounts for rice corn and oil bearing crops have similar proportions around 10 for the water allocation proportions for specific crops in different planning periods it is noticed that all water allocation proportions except vegetables and fruits would show a slightly decreasing trend even though the cultivation areas for wheat and oil bearing crops would increase during the planning horizon for instance the water allocation proportion for wheat would be 43 2 in period 1 and 40 3 41 1 in period 6 this would mainly be attributed to the significant increase for water consumption for vegetables in which its water allocation proportion increases from 18 7 in period 1 to 23 5 24 9 in period 6 in terms of the proportion for water demand from fruits it would slightly increase due to the increasing cultivation area in periods 1 and 2 but would decrease due to the competitive demand from vegetables moreover even though there are visible uncertainties in the planting areas for different crops in different periods these uncertainties would not significantly influence the water allocation proportions leading to limited fluctuation ranges for the proportion values in addition to water resources to support crop growing energies such as electricity or fossil energy are required in agricultural activities such as machinery and irrigation fig 6 presents the energy utilizations for different crop cultivation in different time periods in which the purple and red bars respectively represent the energy allocation proportions under the demanding i e lower bound of the objective function and advantageous i e the upper bound of the objective function conditions it is noticed that cultivation of wheat would be the prioritized energy user which would consume more than 35 energies allocated to all agricultural activities this is similar with the utilization of water resources however even though less than 10 water resources would be distributed to corn cultivation this kind of crop would utilize more than 20 of energies just followed the energy consumption of wheat cultivation this is because that the energy utilization is directly associated with the cultivation areas for different crops and corn would have the second largest planting area as presented in table 4 due to this fact the energy usage pattern is different from the water utilization which is affected by both water availabilities as well as the unit water consumption for different crops 5 discussion the objective of the ifp wefn model is to achieve a maximized unit benefit for the agriculture department with respect to the water consumption which is different from traditional wefn model aiming to maximize the total benefit of the agricultural department table 5 presents the planting crop areas for different crops in different time periods generated from an ilp wefn model the planting scheme from ilp wefn model would be different from that generated by the ifp wefn model for instance the planting areas for vegetables from the ilp wefn model would be 16 518 17 394 and 15 453 18 551 km2 in periods 1 and 2 while in comparison the planting areas from ifp wefn model would respectively be 14 013 14 854 and 14 089 14 934 km2 in periods 1 and 2 this suggests that maximizing the total system benefit would not necessarily lead to a maximum unit benefit fig 7 shows the total benefit of the agricultural department obtained from the ifp wefn and ilp wefn models the results show that the total benefit from ifp wefn model would slightly lower than that from ilp wefn model in detail the total benefit obtained from ifp wefn model would range within 2 32 2 84 1012 rmb while the total benefit from ilp wefn model fluctuates within 2 35 2 85 1012 rmb this is due to the difference in the objective for those two models fig 8 presents the unit benefits obtained from the ifp wefn and ilp wefn models conversely with the total benefit the unit benefit from ifp wefn model would higher than that from ilp wefn model the unit benefit of ifp wefn model would range within 37 1 44 1 rmb m3 while the unit benefit from ilp wefn model would change within 36 5 43 4 rmb m3 due to the uncertainties in model parameters these results indicate that the planting scheme from ifp wefn model would be more appropriate with a priority of water utilization efficiency while the scheme from ilp wefn model would be adopted for a purpose of maximizing the system benefit in this study the contradictory objectives between system benefits and water consumption were reflected through a fractional objective compared with traditional ilp wefn model the proposed ifp wefn model would give priority to the unit system benefit with respect to water utilization rather than the total system benefit therefore higher unit benefits would be generated by the ifp wefn model i e 37 1 44 1 rmb m3 which can enhance the utilization efficiency of water resources this is particularly meaningful for henan province which is one of the most water scarce regions in china moreover the introduction of fractional programming into the ifp wefn model can also have merits in tackling contradictory objectives than other relevant approaches such as bi level or multi level programming methods in i avoiding priority pre specification among those two objectives and ii relative simple solution procedures xu et al 2022 6 conclusions in this study an inexact fractional programming ifp method has been adopted to provide management strategies for the complex water energy food nexus wefn system an ifp wefn model has been formulated for planning the wefn system of henan province solutions of the planting areas for different crops under different periods have been generated in order to achieve a maximized unit benefit with respect to the water utilization the solutions obtained from the ifp wefn model is subject to maximizing the utilization efficiency of water resources which would tend to approach sustainable water resources management the results indicated that among the nine crops the planting areas for rice corn beans tubers and cotton would decrease while the other four crops namely wheat oil bearing crops vegetables and fruits would have more planting areas more specifically the planting area for vegetables would significantly increase leading to a noticeable decrease in the planting area for cotton moreover the water demand for most crops would decrease over the planning horizon due to the remarkable increase for the water demand from the vegetables compared with the ifp wefn model the ilp wefn model merely consider the total system benefit and thus leads to a different planting scheme for the henan province the results suggest that the unit benefit from ifp wefn model would higher than that from ilp wefn model even though the total benefit from ilp wefn model is slightly lower the obtained results for the ifp wefn model can support further planting schemes in henan province from a perspective of sustainable water resources management the henan province is recommended to reduce the cultivation area for rice and corn but at the same time increase wheat planting to satisfy the local demand of cereals in addition due to the realization of the healthy life more fruits and vegetables will be needed which lead to increasing trends for the cultivation areas of these two crops especially after 2023 correspondingly some crops would be less planted due to the limited availability of arable lands in which the plant area of cotton would be decreased most significantly the ifp wefn model could deal with contradictions among various objectives under uncertainty however in real world wefn management problems the flow of natural surface water may be affected by a variety of factors from climate topographic and other aspects showing various uncertainties in different formats such as fuzzy sets and random variables therefore further studies are required to deal with multiple uncertainties in the wefn system besides only one water resource i e surface water were considered in this study consequently further studies are required to include other water resources such as groundwater diverted water and reclaimed water as well as to reveal the effect of consumption change of water for agriculture to other consumption such a challenge can be addressed through integrating factorial analysis method into the ifp wefn model credit authorship contribution statement kai huang methodology code

1324,with growing global use of methanol as a fuel additive and extensive use in other industrial processes there is the potential for unintended release and spills into soils and aquifers in these subsurface systems it is likely that methanol will be readily biodegraded however degradation may lead to the production of by products most importantly methane possibly resulting in explosion hazards and volatile fatty acids vfas causing aesthetic issues for groundwater in this study the formation of these potentially harmful by products due to methanol biodegradation was investigated in natural sand and silt sediments using microcosms inoculated with neat methanol 100 ranging in concentration from 100 to 100 000 ppm to assess the rate of degradation and by product formation water and headspace samples were collected and analyzed for methanol volatile fatty acids vfas including acetic butyric and propionic acid cation metal concentrations al ca fe k mg mn and na microbial community structure and activity headspace pressure gas composition ch4 co2 o2 and n2 and compound specific isotopes methanol was completely biodegraded in sand and silt up to concentrations of 1000 ppm and 10 000 ppm respectively degradation was initially aerobic consuming oxygen o2 and producing carbon dioxide co2 when o2 was depleted the microcosms became anaerobic and a lag in methanol degradation occurred ranging from 41 to 87 days following this lag methanol was preferentially degraded to acetate coupled with co2 reduction microcosms with high methanol concentrations 10 000 ppm were driven further down the redox ladder and exhibited fermentation leading to concurrent acetate and methane ch4 generation in all cases acetate was an intermediate product further degraded to the final products of ch4 and co2 carbonates present in the microcosm sediments helped buffer vfa acidification and replenished co2 methane generation in the anaerobic microcosms was short lived but temporarily reached high rates up to 13 mg kg 1 day 1 under the conditions of these experiments methanol degradation occurred rapidly after initial lag periods which were a function of methanol concentration and sediment type our experiment also showed that methanol degradation and associated methane production can occur in a stepwise fashion keywords methanol degradation groundwater methane microcosm 1 introduction methanol is a commonly used industrial chemical for a variety of applications including the manufacture of other chemicals e g acetic acid formaldehyde as a solvent and as an additive to fuels government of alberta 2010 nowell 1994 united states environmental protection agency 2000 alcohol blended fuels such as methanol and ethanol have become an attractive and commonly used alternative to traditional hydrocarbon fuels because these oxygenated compounds reduce emissions are low cost and available in the market bromberg and cheng 2010 alcohols are also known to offer a safer alternative to other oxygenating fuel additives e g lead methyl tertiary butyl ether because they lead to less adverse health effects and are more easily biodegraded in the environment powers et al 2001 reichhardt 1999 verhelst et al 2019 the use of methanol has been less widespread than ethanol due to political advocacy despite its properties as a neat m100 100 methanol fuel source or additive e g m85 85 methanol and 15 gasoline produced from both renewable and non renewable sources the ease of methanol production adds to its attractiveness as a fuel additive malcolm pirnie inc 1999 verhelst et al 2019 historically in the united states the use of methanol blended fuel specifically m85 has been limited to high performance vehicles and some specially designed engines however widespread use has not yet been achieved bromberg and cheng 2010 malcolm pirnie inc 1999 in contrast china leads the global consumption of methanol as a fuel with a reported consumption in 2016 of 500 000 barrels per day u s energy information administration 2017 this usage appears to be growing extensively each year in addition india is exploring substantial expansion of m15 15 methanol 85 gasoline to reduce energy imports and atmospheric pollution singh et al 2019 with increased global usage of methanol and a desire for increased use of methanol blended fuels concern for the environment and human health methanol can lead to severe health effects including blindness neurological damage and even death after consuming low volumes of pure methanol becker 1983 machiele 1989 moon 2017 national toxicology program 2006 also increases due to unintended releases of neat methanol into terrestrial and aquatic compartments of the biosphere including soil and groundwater systems bromberg and cheng 2010 fargo 1993 this risk is demonstrated in the united states by methanol being ranked ninth of 490 chemicals being released to the environment in 2019 of which approximately 17 19 8 million lbs was spilled to land and surface waters us environmental protection agency 2019 however the fate and transport of methanol in the subsurface is not currently well understood and requires targeted research methanol ch3oh also referred to as meoh is completely miscible with water does not strongly partition from water phase in the presence of a gas phase sander 2015 and tends to be weakly retarded within the subsurface deeb et al 2013 molson et al 2002 therefore once dissolved in water methanol tends to disperse at a rate that is directly proportional to the local groundwater velocity methanol is also readily available as carbon substrate for microorganisms therefore biodegradation is expected to play an important role in the fate of meoh in groundwater deeb et al 2013 the biodegradation of methanol in natural systems can occur under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions table 1 biodegradation readily occurs under oxic conditions deeb et al 2013 goldsmith 1985 howard et al 1991 and as a result rapidly consumes available oxygen in the subsurface transitioning to anaerobic conditions under anaerobic conditions it has been seen that methanol degradation can occur by methanogenesis to co2 and ch4 dijkhuizen et al 1985 goorissen et al 2004 liamleam and annachhatre 2007 lovley and klug 1983 paulo et al 2004 oxidation utilizing electron acceptors such as sulfate nitrate and iron claus and kutzner 1995 goorissen et al 2004 liamleam and annachhatre 2007 lovley and phillips 1986 1988 paulo et al 2004 homoacetogenesis with acetate as an intermediate balk et al 2002 keller et al 2019 savage and drake 1986 schmidt and ahring 1993 and degradation to other intermediaries including propionate and butyrate dijkhuizen et al 1985 schmidt and ahring 1993 the degradation pathway is highly dependent on the native microbial communities and the underlying conditions e g availability of electron acceptors dissolved constituent partial pressures within the system dolfing 2001 degradation of methanol is often found to be syntrophic involving multiple pathways distributed between indigenous microbial groups goorissen et al 2004 keller et al 2019 paulo et al 2004 schink 1997 previous work has looked to quantify methanol degradation in groundwater systems it has been found that aerobic degradation rates are faster than anaerobic degradation rates nevertheless anaerobic degradation of methanol at low concentrations is expected to be relatively rapid laboratory microcosm studies conducted by goldsmith 1985 evaluated methanol degradation using sediments and groundwater from the unsaturated and saturated zones of three unimpacted aquifers located in pennsylvania new york and virginia in sets of microcosms from all three sites methanol degradation rates at concentrations between 1 and 1000 mg l 1 were similar 0 8 20 4 mg l 1 day 1 for sediments from the new york site there was a noticeable lag time in degradation approximately 20 days but once degradation began the rate was not significantly different than in the microcosms from the other sites goldsmith 1985 suggested that at lower concentrations 100 mg l 1 of methanol the depth from which the sediments were taken affected degradation rates however this effect was not observed at higher concentrations 700 to 1000 mg l 1 suflita and mormile 1993 constructed microcosms from the methanogenic portion of a shallow anoxic aquifer polluted by municipal landfill leachate at a methanol concentration of 133 mg l 1 they noted a 5 day acclimation period lag before degradation occurred and a degradation rate of approximately 19 7 mg l 1 day 1 bondehagen 2010 found that in anaerobic microcosms using natural groundwater and sediment with previous contamination the degradation of methanol at 350 mg l 1 was subject to a lag period of 20 days but then commenced at a degradation rate of 20 mg l 1 day 1 although degradation has been studied in the past better understanding of the expected degradation pathways in aquifer systems is required especially at higher methanol concentrations ethanol blended fuels with ethanol having similar chemical properties to methanol have been studied in more detail looking at fate and transport in groundwater systems previous studies have found that ethanol can be readily degraded under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions and also exhibit lag periods of up to 20 days at concentrations of 50 mg l 1 suflita and mormile 1993 one concern that has been studied for ethanol is the potential formation of ch4 freitas et al 2010 as it can present down gradient risk to infrastructure due to the combustibility at relatively low concentrations using microcosms spiked with neat ethanol freitas et al 2010 found that ethanol degradation led to acetate production due to homoacetogenesis followed by ch4 production related to the degradation of the acetate similar to ethanol it has been observed that methanol degradation can lead to significant generation of ch4 for example this has been observed during the use of methanol as an electron donor during bioaugmentation to promote the dehalogenation of chlorinated solvents in the subsurface major et al 2002 sleep et al 2006 ye et al 2009 during this process methanogenesis of the methanol occurs as a secondary process producing ch4 directly which can impact the efficacy of the remediation technique ye et al 2009 therefore it is important that methane production from methanol degradation be quantified under different conditions ethanol degradation has also been shown to produce vfas which can cause aesthetic issues in groundwater and affect natural biological processes powers et al 2001 however these degradation products have not been investigated for methanol and require specific attention there is a particular need to evaluate and quantify the degradation of methanol in natural sediments specifically to understand the production of gaseous by products including ch4 and co2 and aesthetic impacts to groundwater e g due to the generation of vfas acetic butyric and propionic acid as such microcosm experiments were performed where neat 100 methanol at varied concentrations was introduced to natural sand and silt sediments and its degradation measured the objectives of this study were to i quantify biodegradation of neat methanol at multiple concentrations and quantify the formation of gaseous by products and vfas and ii investigate the impact of sediment type on by product production these processes were investigated by measuring gas accumulation and composition in the microcosm headspace isotopic fingerprinting the microbial community structure and geochemical parameters including vfas and cations metals 2 material and methods 2 1 microcosms microcosms were constructed using 1 l glass media storage bottles vwr 89000 240 capped with butyl rubber stoppers to understand the impact of sediment type on the degradation of meoh two types of sediments were used sand and silt described in more detail in section 2 2 and 3 1 both sediment types were sourced from an industrial site in burnaby british columbia and were pristine the microcosms were constructed by filling the bottles with 500 g of sediment then adding water spiked with a known concentration of meoh until 100 ml of headspace remained in the bottle initial design concentrations of methanol were 100 1000 10 000 and 100 000 ppm for each sediment type and all experiments were conducted in duplication table 2 tabulates the actual concentrations achieved meoh concentrations were selected to be within the range expected in aquifers impacted by a neat methanol release deeb et al 2013 these authors report that due to the high solubility of meoh concentrations can range from approximately 7000 to 70 000 ppm in the near vicinity to a neat methanol release assuming mixing ratios between 10 and 100 however because of mixing and dispersion during transport of dissolved meoh in groundwater 100 ppm was also selected additionally 100 000 ppm was selected as a worst case scenario in the vicinity of a spill a control was also constructed for each sediment type where deionized water without methanol was added note that no gas production was observed in the controls and therefore will not be discussed further once filled microcosms were sealed wrapped in aluminum foil to limit exposure to light and stored on their side for the duration of the experiment to limit any gas diffusion through the stopper 2 2 sediment characterization 2 2 1 xrd analysis the mineralogy of the sand and silt sediments was quantified using xrd for this analysis the sand material was sampled twice to assess reproducibility of results e g sand 1 and sand 2 the sediment samples were reduced to 10 Œºm by grinding under ethanol in a vibratory mccrone micronizing mill for 7 min step scan x ray powder diffraction data were collected over a range 3 80 2Œ∏ with cokŒ± radiation on a bruker d8 focus bragg brentano diffractometer equipped with an fe monochromator foil 0 6 mm 0 3 divergence slit incident and diffracted beam soller slits and a lynxeye detector the long fine focus co x ray tube was operated at 35 kv and 40 ma using a take off angle of 6 the x ray diffractograms were analyzed using the international centre for diffraction database pdf 4 and search match software by bruker x ray powder diffraction data of the samples were refined with rietveld program topas 4 2 bruker axs xrd analysis showed that the sediments contained high quantities of silicate minerals such as quartz feldspars and micas table 3 both the sand and silt samples also contained carbonate minerals at similar abundance including ankerite and dolomite at 0 9 wt and 0 8 wt respectively the presence of these minerals is important because they provide buffering capacity for acidity caused by the generation of vfas magnetite was identified as a phase that is possibly present at concentrations between 0 3 wt and 0 4 wt in the sand samples and at 1 0 wt in the silt sample other iron and manganese oxides could not be identified in the xrd results likely due to their amorphous nature and typically low relative abundance with respect to other minerals iron and manganese oxides are of interest because they can act as electron acceptors for microbial degradation of reduced carbon under anaerobic conditions table 1 2 2 2 total elemental composition and toc tic the total elemental composition of the 2 mm material fraction was determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and optical emission spectrometry icp ms oes sgs laboratories in vancouver bc canada analysis after complete sample digestion using 4 acids i e hcl hno3 hf and hclo4 total c was performed using a leco furnace and tic was determined by measuring co2 after treatment with hcl sgs laboratories in vancouver bc canada toc was calculated as the difference between tc and tic in the sandy sediments tic was below detection limits 0 01 while toc was present at low concentrations 0 056 and 0 084 the silt material contained 0 11 tic and 0 10 toc table 4 the measurable tic in the silty sediments is an indication of the presence of carbonates such as the ankerite and dolomite noted in the xrd that could provide ph buffering capacity the absence of tic in the sand samples is inconsistent with the results of the xrd analysis which suggests a tic content of 0 1 based on xrd and tic analyses alone the presence of carbonate minerals in the sand can therefore not be confirmed with certainty elemental analysis indicated that iron and manganese were present both in the sand 2 43 and 2 62 fe and 458 ppm and 512 ppm mn and silt 3 61 fe and 680 ppm mn consistent with the xrd analysis 2 3 geochemical sample collection and analysis 2 3 1 headspace pressure pressure changes induced by consumption of o2 or biogenic gas generation of co2 and ch4 in the headspace of the microcosms as a result of biodegradation were measured twice a week for all samples these measurements allow for the progression of degradation to be quantified pressure measurements were made with a fischer scientific traceable 0 15 psi handheld manometer accuracy 0 3 of full scale or a dwyer series 475 mark iii 0 100 psi digital handheld manometer accuracy 0 5 of full scale the manometers were equipped with a needle which was inserted through the rubber septa of the microcosms to account for pressure changes associated with the removal of aqueous and gaseous samples headspace pressure was taken before and after every sample extraction this allowed for the pressure change resulting from sampling to be quantified the pressure data were then corrected to offset these changes 2 3 2 water samples aqueous samples were taken periodically when substantial change in headspace pressure was observed to reduce the total loss of water from the system sampling was prioritized to collect representative aqueous constituents to understand evolution over time aqueous samples were collected for methanol concentration vfas acetic butyric and propionic acid and cations al ca fe k mg mn and na gas tight syringes were used to extract the water samples 1 ml which were then filtered using 0 22 Œºm syringe filters samples for methanol and vfa analysis were stored in a freezer 20 c until analysis could be completed for methanol analysis the frozen samples were thawed and allowed to reach room temperature then 50 100 Œºl of each sample was analyzed using an sri 310 gas chromatograph gc with a haysep d column and flame ionization detector fid the instrument was calibrated using methanol standards of known concentrations standards were created using 100 methanol and filtered deionized water for meoh analysis calibration was performed against standards in the relevant concentration range and analysis was done in quadruplicate with an analytical error of less than 3 5 vfa analysis was performed using an agilent 7890a gc equipped with an fid at the university of british columbia okanagan kelowna bc canada a multilevel calibration procedure with linear correlation coefficients was used for acetic acid propionic acid and butyric acid internal standards were used for method verification with analytical errors not exceeding 2 5 of analyte concentrations cation samples were acidified with hno3 and stored in a refrigerator at 4 c until analysis cation analysis was performed in house using a varian 725es optical emission spectrometer icp oes based on standards covering the relevant concentration ranges the analytical error associated with the cation concentrations was less than 5 2 3 3 gas samples gas samples were collected from the headspace for compositional and compound specific isotope analysis csia composition samples were collected periodically using a 5 ml hamilton gastight syringe to minimize the loss of headspace gas sample collection was prioritized when significant changes in headspace gas pressures were observed the gas composition was analyzed for co2 ch4 o2 and n2 immediately following collection using a varian cp 4900 micro gc equipped with thermal conductivity detectors tcd following previous work amos et al 2005 jones et al 2014 sihota et al 2011 calibration was completed using known gas standards prior to each analysis period and included periodic verification runs during analysis and at the end of each analysis session using the same standards for csia samples 15 ml were collected for the c3 and c4si microcosms using a hamilton gastight syringe at the end of the experiments prior to decommissioning the samples were then transferred to labco 12 ml pre evacuated glass vials equipped with teflon septas samples were immediately sent to the stable isotope facility at the university of california davis ca and analyzed for Œ¥13c in both co2 and ch4 and for Œ¥2h in ch4 with long term standard deviations of 0 1 0 2 and 2 for Œ¥13c in co2 and ch4 and for Œ¥2h in ch4 respectively 2 4 molecular barcoding to understand the microbial presence and evolution in the sediments pristine sediments reference and sediments exposed to meoh after completion of experiment treated were analyzed following completion of the c2 and c3 microcosm experiments the microcosms were sacrificed and 5 to 10 g of sediments were collected flash frozen on dry ice and stored at 80 c until processing could be completed inclusion of analysis of c4 microcosms was not possible for logistic reasons for all samples nucleic acids were extracted using a modified method developed by lee and hallam 2010 and hurt et al 2001 to determine microbial community structure and activity associated with each methanol microcosm experiment we performed 454 pyrotag sequencing of small subunit ribosomal rna gene and rna ssu rdna and rrna amplicons with three domain resolution see supplementary material a total of 53 795 ssu rdna and 64 069 ssu rrna from the microcosm experiment were processed using qiime version 1 9 0 software package caporaso et al 2010 de novo and reference based chimeric sequences were identified via uchiime edgar et al 2011 and removed prior to taxonomic assignment non chimeric sequences were clustered at 97 into operational taxonomic units otus with uclust where representative sequences from each cluster were queried against the silva 128 ribosomal rna database using the rdp classifier to assign taxonomy quast et al 2012 otus present in less than 5 of the total number of samples were removed prior to any downstream analyses to reduce the over prediction of rare and likely chimeric taxa kunin et al 2010 mcmurdie and holmes 2013 samples with less than 200 otus were also removed from the dataset all downstream data analyses were performed in r using packages including vegan phyloseq pvclust deseq2 indicspecies and tidyverse anders 2010 love et al 2014 mcmurdie and holmes 2013 oksanen et al 2018 wickham 2017 3 results and discussion 3 1 microcosm geochemical analysis 3 1 1 c2 microcosms the c2 microcosms showed rapid degradation of methanol over the initial 20 days of the experiment before slowing fig 1 for the c2 sa microcosms nearly complete 95 degradation occurred by day 57 however for the c2si microcosms 80 degradation had occurred by day 57 with respect to headspace pressure a decrease occurred over the first 35 40 days reaching minimum pressures of 1 9 to 1 4 psi for all microcosms the rate of methanol degradation and pressure decrease corresponded well with each other during this time showing high rates initially and decreasing over time following day 35 40 headspace pressures gradually increased approaching values between 1 4 and 0 8 psi at the end of the experiment headspace composition showed a decrease in o2 from atmospheric levels to non detectable concentrations during the first 35 40 days accompanied by an increase in co2 to 2 within the microcosms the observed decrease in methanol concentrations and headspace pressure as well as changes in gas composition are indicative of aerobic degradation being a substantial driver of methanol degradation at low initial concentrations then transitioning to an anaerobic system the average rate of degradation was estimated based on the elapsed time between the initiation of the experiment until complete meoh degradation table 5 consistent with previous observations the average rate of degradation was 1 7 1 8 mg l 1 day 1 and 1 5 mg l 1 day 1 for the c2 sa and c2si microcosms respectively goldsmith 1985 therefore the rate of degradation was similar in both sediment types 3 1 2 c3 microcosms in the c3 microcosms meoh concentrations initially declined very slowly during the first 30 41 days for the sand fig 2 and 41 days for the silt fig 3 respectively the system transitioned to anaerobic conditions reflected in the immediate drop in headspace pressure and o2 composition in the first 20 days while minor degradation of methanol occurred relative to the initial concentration following this transition degradation remained slow and is herein referred to as a lag period as a result of the system adjusting to the newly established reducing conditions following this lag period methanol degradation was relatively rapid in the sand 90 degradation of methanol had occurred after 85 days and in the silt after 121 140 days degradation beyond 90 methanol depletion slowed considerably with complete degradation occurring after 181 and 150 days for the c3 sa a and c3 sa b microcosms respectively and 136 and 238 days for the c3 si a and c3 si b microcosms respectively the average degradation rates table 5 were consistent with previously reported ranges in the literature bondehagen 2010 goldsmith 1985 suflita and mormile 1993 the sand microcosms had average degradation rates between 4 5 and 7 4 mg l 1 day 1 and maximum degradation rates between 18 4 and 29 2 mg l 1 day 1 while the silt microcosms had average degradation rates between 4 4 and 8 8 mg l 1 day 1 and maximum degradation rates between 17 3 and 20 0 mg l 1 day 1 variable degradation progress within a sediment type is likely attributable to sediment sample variability abundance of electron acceptors and microbial community abundance following the transition to anaerobic conditions and the lag period vfas dominated by acetic acid were first observed approximately 46 days after initiation of the c3 sa microcosms and 60 88 days after the initiation of the c3si microcosms concurrent with the period of rapid methanol degradation the formation of acetic acid can be inferred as the point when anaerobic degradation begins following the reactions shown in table 1 the observed lag time to the initiation of vfa production is herein referred to as the time for the onset of anaerobic degradation after an initial rapid increase in acetic acid concentrations the subsequent decrease in acetic acid day 146 was concurrent with a rapid increase in ch4 gas production as evidenced by the temporal evolution of the headspace pressure fig 2 and fig 3 in the sand microcosms maximum acetic acid concentrations of approximately 100 mg l 1 were observed while the silt microcosms produced much higher concentrations of acetic acid reaching 1000 1200 mg l 1 this finding presents further evidence of differences of the degradation processes within the different aquifer materials the silt provides more favourable conditions for acetate production whereas in the sand acetate production occurs but is rapidly transformed to ch4 concentrations of butyrate and propionate were negligible in comparison to acetate concentrations throughout the experiments headspace pressure fig 2c and d and fig 3c and d for both the sand and silt show similar behavior decreasing during o2 consumption as low as 1 8 psi and 2 1 psi for the sand and silt microcosms respectively and acetic acid production and then increasing as acetic acid concentrations decline as high as 18 psi and 12 psi for the sand and silt respectively for the sand microcosms this non monotonicity is observed at 66 73 days and for the silt microcosms at 164 175 days the generated gas was predominantly ch4 making up between 65 7 and 73 2 and 66 0 to 67 3 for the headspace gas composition for the sand and silt respectively using the generated pressure and headspace composition the ch4 production rate per kg of sediment was calculated to be 8 0 8 8 mg kg 1 day 1 for the sand microcosms and 7 3 10 mg kg 1 day 1 for the silt cation analysis showed that ca and mg concentrations increased during the period of active vfa production fig 2e and f and fig 3e and f and spiked parallel with acetic acid increases the concurrent spike in ca and mg and acetic acid concentrations was more evident in the silt microcosms fig 2e and f ca and mg concentrations in the sand microcosms increased to concentrations of 25 mg l 1 and 10 mg l 1 respectively whereas in the silt microcosm concentrations reached 250 mg l 1 and 50 mg l 1 respectively fig 3e and f confirming that carbonates are present in both sediment types but also suggesting a higher abundance of carbonates in the silt in line with results of the elemental analysis of the sediments other analytes fe k mn na and s showed little change over the duration of the experiment most notably electron acceptors on the redox ladder including fe and mn did not go above the detection limit or exceeded 6 ppm respectively indicating that reductive dissolution of fe and mn oxides was not significant in the c3 microcosms 3 1 3 c4 microcosms a decline in meoh concentrations or changes in headspace pressures were not observed for the c4 sa microcosms over the time period of the study 780 days these microcosms were therefore excluded from analysis this lack of methanol degradation is likely due to the high methanol concentrations inhibiting native microbes in the sand sediments and causing a lag period exceeding the duration of the experiments in contrast methanol degradation was observed in the silt microcosms despite the elevated methanol concentrations c4 si a initially showed marginal degradation that lasted approximately 350 days transitioning into a period of high methanol degradation rates after approximately 400 days this rapid degradation slowed complete methanol degradation was achieved after 577 days in the duplicate microcosm c4 si b marginal meoh degradation occurred for a short period of time 50 days followed by a period of slow meoh degradation that lasted approximately 270 days with a subsequent period of rapid meoh degradation although the microcosms showed different degradation rates the times when complete methanol degradation were reached were similar for both replicates a and b 577 and 525 days respectively the average degradation rates were within the ranges reported in the literature average degradation rate between 17 5 and 17 6 mg l 1 day 1 and maximum degradation rate between 58 7 and 132 0 mg l 1 day 1 bondehagen 2010 goldsmith 1985 suflita and mormile 1993 vfa production in the c4si microcosms showed a stepwise increase in acetic acid during methanol degradation for both replicates acetic acid was detected after 87 days for the c4 si a microcosm fig 4a acetic acid was produced until approximately day 150 and then concentrations were stable at 2200 mg l 1 between day 150 and 322 following this plateau acetic acid rapidly increased to concentrations of 8000 mg l 1 on day 420 and then stabilized again between day 420 and 518 at this point the system transitioned towards acetic acid degradation and complete consumption occurred by day 576 this stepwise increase was also observed in c4 si b fig 4b however three less distinct plateaus in acetic acid concentrations were observed between day 87 and 664 complete consumption of acetic acid was observed by day 702 in addition concentrations of butyric acid were observed with maximum concentrations between 50 and 115 mg l 1 over the duration of the experiments for duplicates a and b respectively for c4 si a fig 4c the initial acetic acid increase occurred during the period of stable headspace pressure as observed in c3 microcosms interestingly the pressure was observed to increase coincident with the increase of acetic acid between days 322 and 420 it was also observed that on day 403 ch4 composition in the headspace reached 88 despite acetic acid concentrations continuing to increase the pressure then stabilized 46 psi above atmospheric pressure concurrent with the peak acetic acid concentrations between days 420 and 518 finally the pressure increased to a maximum value of 127 psi during the complete consumption of acetate from the microcosm using the generated pressure and headspace composition the ch4 production rate per kg of sediment was calculated to be 7 6 mg kg 1 day 1 for the initial increase in pressure and 13 3 mg kg 1 day 1 for the second increase a shift in the composition of the headspace was observed following day 403 when ch4 was seen to decrease to 70 and co2 increased to 26 similar correlations between pressure increase and acetate consumption were seen for c4 si b ca and mg concentrations for c4 si a c4 si b again showed similar but less distinct trends increased to 660 ppm and 232 ppm respectively by day 232 and then stabilized similar to acetic acid until day 361 after this period ca and mg rapidly increased reaching up to 1800 ppm and 200 ppm respectively unlike in the c3 microcosms fe and mn concentrations also increased in the c4 silt microcosms after day 361 reaching concentrations on the order of 100 mg l 1 in the case of fe implying that reductive dissolution took place in the c4 microcosms the fact that an increase in fe and mn was only seen in the c4 microcosms suggests that fe and mn originated in fact from reductive dissolution and not from the dissolution of carbonates since carbonate dissolution occurred in both the c3 and c4 microcosms as the concentrations of acetic acid declined ca fe mg and mn concentrations also decreased other analytes k na and s showed little change over the course of the experiment 3 1 4 c5 microcosms degradation of methanol was not observed for c5 experiments in the sand and the silt confirmed by a lack of changes in headspace pressures and gas composition over the duration of the experiment 780 days the high initial methanol concentration is suspected to have effectively sterilized the native microbes within the sediments leading to an inability to degrade methanol over the recorded time period although degradation did not occur over the 780 day duration of the experiments it may be possible that methanol degradation eventually proceeds assuming remnant microorganisms are able to recover from initial exposure and establish an adapted community structure 3 2 microcosm csia csia was performed on the generated gases in the microcosms for Œ¥13c in co2 and ch4 and Œ¥2h in ch4 after decommissioning the initial isotopic composition of the meoh used for the experiments was 45 7 and 103 1 for Œ¥13c and Œ¥2h respectively csia analysis showed that both c and h isotopes for ch4 were more negative than in meoh and that Œ¥ 13c was more positive in the co2 gas generated than in the feedstock meoh fig 5 as expected the results are indicative of enrichment of the lighter isotopes in ch4 during the process of microbially mediated degradation for Œ¥13c in co2 the most positive signature was seen in the c4 silt microcosms reaching 3 4 o whereas in the c3 sand microcosms the values were measured between 29 5 and 27 5 o and in the silt microcosms values of 22 3 o the more positive signature of Œ¥13c in co2 in the c4si microcosms is indicative of co2 reduction these results also suggest that co2 reduction is not a dominant process in the c3 microcosms implying that more highly reducing conditions developed in the c4 microcosms relative to the c3 microcosms it is also possible that carbonate mineral dissolution contributed to the more positive Œ¥13c signature brand et al 2014 however dissolved ca concentrations suggest that this process took place both in the c3 and c4 microcosms compare figs 2 4 3 3 microbial community structure and activity following sample processing and quality control 3424 otus were used for all downstream analyses calculating chao1 indices to generate rarefaction curves revealed the slope for each sample approaching a plateau after approximately 900 unique otus for the sand microcosms and 600 unique otus for the silt microcosms this suggests that the majority of the microbial diversity present in each sample was represented with the exception of extremely rare taxa to survey the microbial community structure among and between c2 and c3 microcosm experiments non metric multidimensional scaling nmds was conducted using otu distributions normalized using a variance stabilizing transformation a separation between the silt and sand microcosms as well as separation away from the original reference samples for each methanol treatment was observed fig s1 indicator species analysis with 1000 permutations was then performed to determine specific otus associated with each condition using a threshold indicator value 0 7 and p value 0 05 a total of 48 indicator otus were identified for the sand microcosm and 28 for the silt microcosms indicator otus associated with the silt microcosm were primarily affiliated with methanomicrobia methanogenic archaea and acidobacteria while indicator otus associated with sand were affiliated with a larger variety of bacterial phyla such as acidobacteria firmicutes chloroflexi and proteobacteria supplementary material table s1 to better resolve microbial community structure the taxonomic composition of the community was evaluated at the phylum and order level fig 6 euryarchaeota proteobacteria acidobacteria actinobacteria firmicutes and chloroflexi were the dominant phyla in both rdna abundance and rrna potential activity fractions in all methanol microcosm experiments fig s2 evaluating the phylum level taxonomic composition across the c2 and c3 methanol treatments revealed strong similarities in both the sand and silt microcosms as well as shifts in the community structure upon exposure indeed comparing reference samples to those exposed to the methanol treatments revealed shifts in the relative abundance and potential activity of the dominant taxonomic groups fig 6 microbial community structure within the c2 and c3 microcosm experiments was consistent with a shift towards one carbon utilizing and methanogenic taxa a comparison between reference and treated samples revealed enrichment in gammaproteobacteria acidobacteria firmicutes and methanogenic euryarchaeota accompanied by a decrease in actinobacteria further evaluation of these groups at the order level revealed key players in aerobic and anaerobic degradation processes including pseudomonadales clostridiales bacillales and methanosarcinales kolb 2009 rajala and bomberg 2017 the presence of methanosarcinales is especially relevant in conjunction with significant levels of methane gas generated within the microcosm experiments alongside increases in acetic acid concentrations indeed archaea affiliated with the methanosarcinales are known to perform acetoclastic methanogenesis where acetate is the primary substrate converted to methane vanwonterghem et al 2016 the shift of the microbial community structure to one dominated by methanogens and acetogens is expected since it is commonly observed in studies quantifying community structure evolution in response to the decomposition of alcohol blended fuels c√°piro et al 2008 ma et al 2013 2015 mcleod et al 2018 nelson et al 2010 the increased abundance and potential activity of this group alongside geochemical characterization suggests acetoclastic methanogenesis as the dominant process in methane generation this is especially true within the silt microcosm experiments as methanosarcinales were the dominant group identified in the euryarchaetoa phylum for the sand microcosm methanocellales were also enriched in the treated samples up to 10 fold when compared to reference samples the presence of methanocellales within the sand microcosms but not in the silt suggests that there were differences in the microbial community composition of each material from the start this is noteworthy as it highlights the importance of the physical environment in shaping microbial community composition and ultimately function in the context of blended fuel attenuation processes 3 4 discussion of methanol degradation pathways and effects on gas production patterns as expected methanol was readily degraded in the presence of o2 suggesting that in aerobic systems with a ready supply of o2 methanol will not be persistent however when o2 becomes limiting a transition to anaerobic degradation causes a lag time in methanol degradation the duration of which is dependent on the initial concentration of methanol and sediment type overall the degradation products expected are acetate and eventually ch4 and co2 predominately in gaseous form although the resulting carbon species following complete degradation of methanol were found to be the same for the c3 and c4 microcosms the degradation pathway differed affecting the evolution and timing of gas production both pathways will be described below utilizing a mass balance of carbon within the system mass balances were conducted by comparing the measured amount of carbon transformed to other forms including vfas co2 and ch4 to the expected amount based on the concentration of methanol remaining in the system these calculations showed that the mass balance was closed for all microcosms with a maximum discrepancy over the duration of the experiments of 19 this difference is considered acceptable based on the varied sampling frequency of all analytes and expected analytical accuracy both the c3 sa and c3si microcosms saw similar degradation pathways and overall degradation products however the c3si microcosms exhibited slower degradation therefore the phases of degradation are more distinct based on the sampling frequency for that reason the description of methanol degradation utilizes the data from the c3 si a microcosms three distinct phases occurred fig 3a in phase 1 0 to 43 days the system transitioned from aerobic conditions degrading methanol by reaction 1 in table 1 producing co2 until all available o2 was consumed following the complete consumption of o2 from the system a lag period was observed where minimal changes occurred because of difficulties distinguishing between the consumption of o2 and the lag period these stages are considered one phase following phase 1 phase 2 day 43 to 160 saw rapid degradation of methanol in this phase the main product measured were acetic acid accompanied by an increase in ca2 interestingly there was no increase in co2 or ch4 during this time based on the mass balance methanol was being degraded to acetic acid by reaction 8 in table 1 consuming co2 simultaneously because of the acidity generated carbonate dissolution was also occurring 1 cac o 3 2 h c a 2 c o 2 h 2 o this leads to a net reaction in this phase of 2 4 c h 3 oh 1 5 cac o 3 0 5 c o 2 3 c h 3 co o 1 5 c a 2 3 5 h 2 o therefore by eq 2 there is demand for co2 from mass balance it was found that sufficient co2 was generated in phase 1 from aerobic degradation and initially present in the system atmospheric co2 to drive this reaction forward completely degrading the remaining methanol in the system the final phase phase 3 occurred from day 160 to 218 when the experiment was completed in this phase acetic acid was consumed and ch4 and co2 were produced from the mass balance it is evident that during phase 3 acetic acid was consumed following reaction 4 in table 1 transforming to ch4 and co2 however ca2 also decreased suggesting that carbonate precipitation was occurring by 3 c a 2 c o 2 h 2 o cac o 3 2 h overall this gives a net reaction for phase 3 of 4 2 c h 3 co o c a 2 h 2 o 2 c h 4 c o 2 cac o 3 combining phases 2 and 3 together gives the overall degradation pathway for the anaerobic degradation the majority of degradation overall the reaction is 5 4 c h 3 oh 3 c h 4 c o 2 2 h 2 o therefore overall 75 of the carbon in the system was converted to ch4 and 25 to co2 controlled by the degradation sequence production of these gases was delayed but then occurred rapidly mass balance shows that for all c3 microcosms 74 81 of the mass remaining at the end of the experiment was in the form of ch4 and 19 26 in the form of co2 this presents strong evidence that this was the overall reaction pathway for the c3 microcosms indicating a strong potential for delayed and short lived rapid gas production both sediment types showed a delayed response in terms of the onset of gas production however timing was different and the rate of gas production also varied between sediment types the c4si microcosms saw a similar overall degradation as the c3 microcosms however the intermediary phases differed to describe this degradation the c4 si a microcosm will be used as the phases are distinct in the c4 si a microcosm six distinct phases occurred identified by hashed lines in fig 4a the first phase was from 0 to 87 days when methanol degradation occurred by aerobic oxidation reaction 1 in table 1 which resulted in a marginal decrease in methanol concentration and complete consumption of o2 from the system forming co2 the second phase was observed between days 88 and 239 overall increases in acetic acid and ca2 occurred similar to phase 2 of the c3 microcosms mass balance results suggest that the net reaction occurring here follows eq 2 above where methanol was degraded to acetic acid involving co2 reduction with a simultaneous increase of ca2 as a result of carbonate dissolution for the c4 microcosms this phase is limited by the amount of co2 in the system therefore once the co2 initially present in the system from the atmosphere from aerobic degradation and supplied by carbonate dissolution was consumed the reaction could not progress this leads to phase 3 which was a lag period from day 239 to day 358 during this phase minimal meoh degradation or changes in product concentrations were observed and it appears that the system was adapting to the new redox conditions limited by the availability of co2 following the lag period after 358 days acetic acid ch4 and ca2 increased and meoh rapidly decreased this constitutes phase 4 which occurred from day 358 to 420 based on the mass balance at this time fermentation of methanol to acetate and molecular hydrogen reaction 6 in table 1 occurred the generated acidity from this reaction led to additional carbonate dissolution eq 1 producing co2 finally this co2 underwent reduction to ch4 reaction in table 1 the net reaction for these three syntrophic reactions is 6 4 c h 3 oh cac o 3 2 c h 3 co o c h 4 c a 2 3 h 2 o although studies which look at the thermodynamics of methanol degradation are sparse insight can be gained from the literature on ethanol degradation to support degradation in phase 4 this finding is consistent with dolfing 2001 based on the findings of barker 1936 who found that thermodynamics favour acetogenic degradation rather than complete oxidation to ch4 under the conditions expected in methanogenic systems in addition csia data shows significantly more positive Œ¥13c in co2 providing additional evidence for the occurrence of co2 reduction therefore it is likely that degradation occurred by fermentation carbonate dissolution and co2 reduction computing the total mass of carbon in the form of meoh and carbon released from carbonate dissolution to the mass of carbon in the form of vfas ch4 in the headspace and remaining in the form of meoh finds that the mass balance is closed within 6 comparing the amount of acetate and ch4 shows that in the experimental system 79 of carbon was in the form of acetate and 21 of carbon was in the form of ch4 based on the proposed degradation pathway eq 6 the theoretical carbon products should be 80 acetate and 20 ch4 providing additional evidence for the validity of this hypothesis following day 420 more than 90 of meoh degradation occurred this led to phase 5 from day 420 to 519 which corresponds to another lag period this lag period was characterized by minimal meoh degradation further evidenced by headspace pressure plateauing during this time the remaining meoh 10 continued to be degraded by eq 6 but at a marginal rate this period also appears to represent a transition of the system due to the native microbial communities shifting to a community favourable for acetoclastic methanogenesis in the final phase phase 6 which occurred from day 519 to 780 decommissioning all methanol was degraded and acetate was then consumed by acetoclastic methanogenesis reaction 4 in table 1 the co2 produced then drives the precipitation of carbonates 7 c a 2 c o 2 h 2 o cac o 3 2 h this gives a net reaction of 8 2 c h 3 co o c a 2 h 2 o 2 c h 4 c o 2 cac o 3 combining eqs 6 and 8 gives the overall net reaction for the anaerobic degradation of meoh in the c4 microcosms which ends up as the same overall reaction as the c3 microcosm eq 5 mass balance shows that for both c4 si a and c4 si b 76 and 74 of the mass remaining at the end of the experiment was in the form of ch4 and 24 and 26 in the form of co2 respectively therefore strongly supporting this overall degradation pathway the implication of this more complex degradation pathway in comparison to the c3 microcosm is that gas production is more significantly delayed and can occur in multiple stages making it more difficult to anticipate when and at what rate gas production and ch4 release might occur although the time lag to the onset of methanogenesis is longer than for the corresponding c3 microcosms the rate of production is ultimately higher leading to significant gas accumulation in the closed microcosms methanol degradation forms three main products acetate ch4 and co2 however acetate is an intermediary which in late stages will be degraded to ch4 and co2 which is consistent with previous work on ethanol degradation freitas et al 2010 this reaction pathway was consistent between both the c3 and c4 microcosms however it is clear that the reducing conditions as a result of the initial concentration are different and lead to varied phases within the overall pathway the fact that no degradation was observed for the c4 sand microcosms points to the effect of meoh toxicity at this concentration level in the sand despite shorter lag times for gas production in the sand microcosms relative to the silt microcosm in the c3 experiments these observations further illustrate the challenges associated with anticipating degradation pathways and gas production rates as a function of sediment type and meoh concentrations 4 conclusions the degradation of methanol in groundwater systems was studied by means of microcosm experiments the experiments conducted show that methanol degradation in groundwater systems is expected to occur under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions as the systems transition from aerobic to anaerobic conditions a lag time in methanol degradation and associated gas production is observed the magnitude of which increases between sand and silt sediments and increased initial concentration of methanol after this lag the rate of degradation is dependent on the aquifer material and initial concentration of methanol released degradation was observed in the sand material at concentrations as high as 1000 ppm and in silt as high as 10 000 ppm above these concentrations no degradation was observed over the time periods studied assessment of the degradation by products found that under anaerobic conditions acetate ch4 and co2 are expected to be formed acetate is however an intermediate product which is then further degraded to ch4 and co2 the overall anaerobic degradation of methanol was consistent between the c3 and c4 microcosms however the initial concentration affected reducing conditions altering intermediate degradation phases co2 was a limiting factor in the oxidation of methanol in the c3 microcosms initial co2 abundance and the co2 generation from carbonate dissolution was sufficient to drive complete methanol degradation to acetate however the c4 microcosm had insufficient initial abundance of co2 to degrade the higher amount of meoh driving the system further down on the redox ladder leading to fermentation coupling this transition with carbonate dissolution as a result of the produced acidity caused the production of ch4 during methanol degradation which was unexpected based on previous work on ethanol degradation freitas et al 2010 interestingly carbonate dissolution played a significant role in this system in non carbonate aquifer systems the degradation may be significantly different such that minimal ch4 production would occur during methanol degradation and acidity would not be buffered therefore it is clear that the reducing conditions i e position on the redox ladder will influence the intermediary product formation in methanol contaminated systems however the common end products are ch4 and co2 differences across media type and across duplicated microcosms suggest that media heterogeneity influence degradation progression although the microcosms are presumed to be homogeneous and well mixed variations occurred heterogeneity will affect the distribution of methanol microbial communities and electron acceptors within an aquifer therefore it is expected that methanol degradation and by product generation will be variable within the subsurface in addition although high concentrations of methanol were observed to effectively sterilize the sediments of native microbial communities heterogeneity of the subsurface has the potential to mitigate this inhibiting factor for example if a high concentration spill were to occur it is possible that this sterilization could occur in the vicinity of the bulk methanol however along the edges of the plume where mixing and dilution occurs favourable conditions for microbial communities can be expected to develop leading to the degradation of methanol subsequently allowing for degradation to continue as the plume becomes more dilute overall the study results show that gas generation in response to meoh degradation is delayed is a function of sediment type is affected by initial meoh concentrations levels and can occur in a stepwise fashion during short time intervals and at rapid rates it may be that distinct phases of gas formation at a spill site are not as significant as seen in the c4 silt microcosms studied here due to heterogeneities of natural sediments on the spill scale which may lead to a more evenly distributed gas production based on the results of this study it is expected that methanol will be readily biodegraded in aquifers with average degradation rates ranging from 1 5 17 6 mg l 1 day 1 similar to rates expected for ethanol these high rates coupled with expected plume dilution suggest that methanol will not be persistent and can be oxidized from the subsurface in less than 500 days based on the sediments and concentrations used in this study the results also suggest that the aesthetic impacts e g vfas to the aquifer will be temporary as they are quickly degraded to ch4 and co2 however it is expected that substantial ch4 generation at high rates 7 3 to 13 mg kg 1 day 1 will occur during degradation possibly in a stepwise pattern that is difficult to predict this ch4 can present hazards down gradient and has been shown at sites utilizing bioaugmentation to affect the flow field within the groundwater system e g gas production reduces the relative hydraulic conductivity and can lead to flow conduiting ch4 and co2 production might however allow for monitoring of complete methanol degradation by means of surface effluxes allowing for quantification of natural attenuation credit authorship contribution statement cole j c van de ven methodology formal analysis validation visualization writing original draft writing review editing

1324,with growing global use of methanol as a fuel additive and extensive use in other industrial processes there is the potential for unintended release and spills into soils and aquifers in these subsurface systems it is likely that methanol will be readily biodegraded however degradation may lead to the production of by products most importantly methane possibly resulting in explosion hazards and volatile fatty acids vfas causing aesthetic issues for groundwater in this study the formation of these potentially harmful by products due to methanol biodegradation was investigated in natural sand and silt sediments using microcosms inoculated with neat methanol 100 ranging in concentration from 100 to 100 000 ppm to assess the rate of degradation and by product formation water and headspace samples were collected and analyzed for methanol volatile fatty acids vfas including acetic butyric and propionic acid cation metal concentrations al ca fe k mg mn and na microbial community structure and activity headspace pressure gas composition ch4 co2 o2 and n2 and compound specific isotopes methanol was completely biodegraded in sand and silt up to concentrations of 1000 ppm and 10 000 ppm respectively degradation was initially aerobic consuming oxygen o2 and producing carbon dioxide co2 when o2 was depleted the microcosms became anaerobic and a lag in methanol degradation occurred ranging from 41 to 87 days following this lag methanol was preferentially degraded to acetate coupled with co2 reduction microcosms with high methanol concentrations 10 000 ppm were driven further down the redox ladder and exhibited fermentation leading to concurrent acetate and methane ch4 generation in all cases acetate was an intermediate product further degraded to the final products of ch4 and co2 carbonates present in the microcosm sediments helped buffer vfa acidification and replenished co2 methane generation in the anaerobic microcosms was short lived but temporarily reached high rates up to 13 mg kg 1 day 1 under the conditions of these experiments methanol degradation occurred rapidly after initial lag periods which were a function of methanol concentration and

gasoline to reduce energy imports and atmospheric pollution singh et al 2019 with increased global usage of methanol and a desire for increased use of methanol blended fuels concern for the environment and human health methanol can lead to severe health effects including blindness neurological damage and even death after consuming low volumes of pure methanol becker 1983 machiele 1989 moon 2017 national toxicology program 2006 also increases due to unintended releases of neat methanol into terrestrial and aquatic compartments of the biosphere including soil and groundwater systems bromberg and cheng 2010 fargo 1993 this risk is demonstrated in the united states by methanol being ranked ninth of 490 chemicals being released to the environment in 2019 of which approximately 17 19 8 million lbs was spilled to land and surface waters us environmental protection agency 2019 however the fate and transport of methanol in the subsurface is not currently well understood and requires targeted research methanol ch3oh also referred to as meoh is completely miscible with water does not strongly partition from water phase in the presence of a gas phase sander 2015 and tends to be weakly retarded within the subsurface deeb et al 2013 molson et al 2002 therefore once dissolved in water methanol tends to disperse at a rate that is directly proportional to the local groundwater velocity methanol is also readily available as carbon substrate for microorganisms therefore biodegradation is expected to play an important role in the fate of meoh in groundwater deeb et al 2013 the biodegradation of methanol in natural systems can occur under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions table 1 biodegradation readily occurs under oxic conditions deeb et al 2013 goldsmith 1985 howard et al 1991 and as a result rapidly consumes available oxygen in the subsurface transitioning to anaerobic conditions under anaerobic conditions it has been seen that methanol degradation can occur by methanogenesis to co2 and ch4 dijkhuizen et al 1985 goorissen et al 2004 liamleam and annachhatre 2007 lovley and klug 1983 paulo et al 2004 oxidation utilizing electron acceptors such as sulfate nitrate and iron claus and kutzner 1995 goorissen et al 2004 liamleam and annachhatre 2007 lovley and phillips 1986 1988 paulo et al 2004 homoacetogenesis with acetate as an intermediate balk et al 2002 keller et al 2019 savage and drake 1986 schmidt and ahring 1993 and degradation to other intermediaries including propionate and butyrate dijkhuizen et al 1985 schmidt and ahring 1993 the degradation pathway is highly dependent on the native microbial communities and the underlying conditions e g availability of electron acceptors dissolved constituent partial pressures within the system dolfing 2001 degradation of methanol is often found to be syntrophic involving multiple pathways distributed between indigenous microbial groups goorissen et al 2004 keller et al 2019 paulo et al 2004 schink 1997 previous work has looked to quantify methanol degradation in groundwater systems it has been found that aerobic degradation rates are faster than anaerobic degradation rates nevertheless anaerobic degradation of methanol at low concentrations is expected to be relatively rapid laboratory microcosm studies conducted by goldsmith 1985 evaluated methanol degradation using sediments and groundwater from the unsaturated and saturated zones of three unimpacted aquifers located in pennsylvania new york and virginia in sets of microcosms from all three sites methanol degradation rates at concentrations between 1 and 1000 mg l 1 were similar 0 8 20 4 mg l 1 day 1 for sediments from the new york site there was a noticeable lag time in degradation approximately 20 days but once degradation began the rate was not significantly different than in the microcosms from the other sites goldsmith 1985 suggested that at lower concentrations 100 mg l 1 of methanol the depth from which the sediments were taken affected degradation rates however this effect was not observed at higher concentrations 700 to 1000 mg l 1 suflita and mormile 1993 constructed microcosms from the methanogenic portion of a shallow anoxic aquifer polluted by municipal landfill leachate at a methanol concentration of 133 mg l 1 they noted a 5 day acclimation period lag before degradation occurred and a degradation rate of approximately 19 7 mg l 1 day 1 bondehagen 2010 found that in anaerobic microcosms using natural groundwater and sediment with previous contamination the degradation of methanol at 350 mg l 1 was subject to a lag period of 20 days but then commenced at a degradation rate of 20 mg l 1 day 1 although degradation has been studied in the past better understanding of the expected degradation pathways in aquifer systems is required especially at higher methanol concentrations ethanol blended fuels with ethanol having similar chemical properties to methanol have been studied in more detail looking at fate and transport in groundwater systems previous studies have found that ethanol can be readily degraded under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions and also exhibit lag periods of up to 20 days at concentrations of 50 mg l 1 suflita and mormile 1993 one concern that has been studied for ethanol is the potential formation of ch4 freitas et al 2010 as it can present down gradient risk to infrastructure due to the combustibility at relatively low concentrations using microcosms spiked with neat ethanol freitas et al 2010 found that ethanol degradation led to acetate production due to homoacetogenesis followed by ch4 production related to the degradation of the acetate similar to ethanol it has been observed that methanol degradation can lead to significant generation of ch4 for example this has been observed during the use of methanol as an electron donor during bioaugmentation to promote the dehalogenation of chlorinated solvents in the subsurface major et al 2002 sleep et al 2006 ye et al 2009 during this process methanogenesis of the methanol occurs as a secondary process producing ch4 directly which can impact the efficacy of the remediation technique ye et al 2009 therefore it is important that methane production from methanol degradation be quantified under different conditions ethanol degradation has also been shown to produce vfas which can cause aesthetic issues in groundwater and affect natural biological processes powers et al 2001 however these degradation products have not been investigated for methanol and require specific attention there is a particular need to evaluate and quantify the degradation of methanol in natural sediments specifically to understand the production of gaseous by products including ch4 and co2 and aesthetic impacts to groundwater e g due to the generation of vfas acetic butyric and propionic acid as such microcosm experiments were performed where neat 100 methanol at varied concentrations was introduced to natural sand and silt sediments and its degradation measured the objectives of this study were to i quantify biodegradation of neat methanol at multiple concentrations and quantify the formation of gaseous by products and vfas and ii investigate the impact of sediment type on by product production these processes were investigated by measuring gas accumulation and composition in the microcosm headspace isotopic fingerprinting the microbial community structure and geochemical parameters including vfas and cations metals 2 material and methods 2 1 microcosms microcosms were constructed using 1 l glass media storage bottles vwr 89000 240 capped with butyl rubber stoppers to understand the impact of sediment type on the degradation of meoh two types of sediments were used sand and silt described in more detail in section 2 2 and 3 1 both sediment types were sourced from an industrial site in burnaby british columbia and were pristine the microcosms were constructed by filling the bottles with 500 g of sediment then adding water spiked with a known concentration of meoh until 100 ml of headspace remained in the bottle initial design concentrations of methanol were 100 1000 10 000 and 100 000 ppm for each sediment type and all experiments were conducted in duplication table 2 tabulates the actual concentrations achieved meoh concentrations were selected to be within the range expected in aquifers impacted by a neat methanol release deeb et al 2013 these authors report that due to the high solubility of meoh concentrations can range from approximately 7000 to 70 000 ppm in the near vicinity to a neat methanol release assuming mixing ratios between 10 and 100 however because of mixing and dispersion during transport of dissolved meoh in groundwater 100 ppm was also selected additionally 100 000 ppm was selected as a worst case scenario in the vicinity of a spill a control was also constructed for each sediment type where deionized water without methanol was added note that no gas production was observed in the controls and therefore will not be discussed further once filled microcosms were sealed wrapped in aluminum foil to limit exposure to light and stored on their side for the duration of the experiment to limit any gas diffusion through the stopper 2 2 sediment characterization 2 2 1 xrd analysis the mineralogy of the sand and silt sediments was quantified using xrd for this analysis the sand material was sampled twice to assess reproducibility of results e g sand 1 and sand 2 the sediment samples were reduced to 10 Œºm by grinding under ethanol in a vibratory mccrone micronizing mill for 7 min step scan x ray powder diffraction data were collected over a range 3 80 2Œ∏ with cokŒ± radiation on a bruker d8 focus bragg brentano diffractometer equipped with an fe monochromator foil 0 6 mm 0 3 divergence slit incident and diffracted beam soller slits and a lynxeye detector the long fine focus co x ray tube was operated at 35 kv and 40 ma using a take off angle of 6 the x ray diffractograms were analyzed using the international centre for diffraction database pdf 4 and search match software by bruker x ray powder diffraction data of the samples were refined with rietveld program topas 4 2 bruker axs xrd analysis showed that the sediments contained high quantities of silicate minerals such as quartz feldspars and micas table 3 both the sand and silt samples also contained carbonate minerals at similar abundance including ankerite and dolomite at 0 9 wt and 0 8 wt respectively the presence of these minerals is important because they provide buffering capacity for acidity caused by the generation of vfas magnetite was identified as a phase that is possibly present at concentrations between 0 3 wt and 0 4 wt in the sand samples and at 1 0 wt in the silt sample other iron and manganese oxides could not be identified in the xrd results likely due to their amorphous nature and typically low relative abundance with respect to other minerals iron and manganese oxides are of interest because they can act as electron acceptors for microbial degradation of reduced carbon under anaerobic conditions table 1 2 2 2 total elemental composition and toc tic the total elemental composition of the 2 mm material fraction was determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and optical emission spectrometry icp ms oes sgs laboratories in vancouver bc canada analysis after complete sample digestion using 4 acids i e hcl hno3 hf and hclo4 total c was performed using a leco furnace and tic was determined by measuring co2 after treatment with hcl sgs laboratories in vancouver bc canada toc was calculated as the difference between tc and tic in the sandy sediments tic was below detection limits 0 01 while toc was present at low concentrations 0 056 and 0 084 the silt material contained 0 11 tic and 0 10 toc table 4 the measurable tic in the silty sediments is an indication of the presence of carbonates such as the ankerite and dolomite noted in the xrd that could provide ph buffering capacity the absence of tic in the sand samples is inconsistent with the results of the xrd analysis which suggests a tic content of 0 1 based on xrd and tic analyses alone the presence of carbonate minerals in the sand can therefore not be confirmed with certainty elemental analysis indicated that iron and manganese were present both in the sand 2 43 and 2 62 fe and 458 ppm and 512 ppm mn and silt 3 61 fe and 680 ppm mn consistent with the xrd analysis 2 3 geochemical sample collection and analysis 2 3 1 headspace pressure pressure changes induced by consumption of o2 or biogenic gas generation of co2 and ch4 in the headspace of the microcosms as a result of biodegradation were measured twice a week for all samples these measurements allow for the progression of degradation to be quantified pressure measurements were made with a fischer scientific traceable 0 15 psi handheld manometer accuracy 0 3 of full scale or a dwyer series 475 mark iii 0 100 psi digital handheld manometer accuracy 0 5 of full scale the manometers were equipped with a needle which was inserted through the rubber septa of the microcosms to account for pressure changes associated with the removal of aqueous and gaseous samples headspace pressure was taken before and after every sample extraction this allowed for the pressure change resulting from sampling to be quantified the pressure data were then corrected to offset these changes 2 3 2 water samples aqueous samples were taken periodically when substantial change in headspace pressure was observed to reduce the total loss of water from the system sampling was prioritized to collect representative aqueous constituents to understand evolution over time aqueous samples were collected for methanol concentration vfas acetic butyric and propionic acid and cations al ca fe k mg mn and na gas tight syringes were used to extract the water samples 1 ml which were then filtered using 0 22 Œºm syringe filters samples for methanol and vfa analysis were stored in a freezer 20 c until analysis could be completed for methanol analysis the frozen samples were thawed and allowed to reach room temperature then 50 100 Œºl of each sample was analyzed using an sri 310 gas chromatograph gc with a haysep d column and flame ionization detector fid the instrument was calibrated using methanol standards of known concentrations standards were created using 100 methanol and filtered deionized water for meoh analysis calibration was performed against standards in the relevant concentration range and analysis was done in quadruplicate with an analytical error of less than 3 5 vfa analysis was performed using an agilent 7890a gc equipped with an fid at the university of british columbia okanagan kelowna bc canada a multilevel calibration procedure with linear correlation coefficients was used for acetic acid propionic acid and butyric acid internal standards were used for method verification with analytical errors not exceeding 2 5 of analyte concentrations cation samples were acidified with hno3 and stored in a refrigerator at 4 c until analysis cation analysis was performed in house using a varian 725es optical emission spectrometer icp oes based on standards covering the relevant concentration ranges the analytical error associated with the cation concentrations was less than 5 2 3 3 gas samples gas samples were collected from the headspace for compositional and compound specific isotope analysis csia composition samples were collected periodically using a 5 ml hamilton gastight syringe to minimize the loss of headspace gas sample collection was prioritized when significant changes in headspace gas pressures were observed the gas composition was analyzed for co2 ch4 o2 and n2 immediately following collection using a varian cp 4900 micro gc equipped with thermal conductivity detectors tcd following previous work amos et al 2005 jones et al 2014 sihota et al 2011 calibration was completed using known gas standards prior to each analysis period and included periodic verification runs during analysis and at the end of each analysis session using the same standards for csia samples 15 ml were collected for the c3 and c4si microcosms using a hamilton gastight syringe at the end of the experiments prior to decommissioning the samples were then transferred to labco 12 ml pre evacuated glass vials equipped with teflon septas samples were immediately sent to the stable isotope facility at the university of california davis ca and analyzed for Œ¥13c in both co2 and ch4 and for Œ¥2h in ch4 with long term standard deviations of 0 1 0 2 and 2 for Œ¥13c in co2 and ch4 and for Œ¥2h in ch4 respectively 2 4 molecular barcoding to understand the microbial presence and evolution in the sediments pristine sediments reference and sediments exposed to meoh after completion of experiment treated were analyzed following completion of the c2 and c3 microcosm experiments the microcosms were sacrificed and 5 to 10 g of sediments were collected flash frozen on dry ice and stored at 80 c until processing could be completed inclusion of analysis of c4 microcosms was not possible for logistic reasons for all samples nucleic acids were extracted using a modified method developed by lee and hallam 2010 and hurt et al 2001 to determine microbial community structure and activity associated with each methanol microcosm experiment we performed 454 pyrotag sequencing of small subunit ribosomal rna gene and rna ssu rdna and rrna amplicons with three domain resolution see supplementary material a total of 53 795 ssu rdna and 64 069 ssu rrna from the microcosm experiment were processed using qiime version 1 9 0 software package caporaso et al 2010 de novo and reference based chimeric sequences were identified via uchiime edgar et al 2011 and removed prior to taxonomic assignment non chimeric sequences were clustered at 97 into operational taxonomic units otus with uclust where representative sequences from each cluster were queried against the silva 128 ribosomal rna database using the rdp classifier to assign taxonomy quast et al 2012 otus present in less than 5 of the total number of samples were removed prior to any downstream analyses to reduce the over prediction of rare and likely chimeric taxa kunin et al 2010 mcmurdie and holmes 2013 samples with less than 200 otus were also removed from the dataset all downstream data analyses were performed in r using packages including vegan phyloseq pvclust deseq2 indicspecies and tidyverse anders 2010 love et al 2014 mcmurdie and holmes 2013 oksanen et al 2018 wickham 2017 3 results and discussion 3 1 microcosm geochemical analysis 3 1 1 c2 microcosms the c2 microcosms showed rapid degradation of methanol over the initial 20 days of the experiment before slowing fig 1 for the c2 sa microcosms nearly complete 95 degradation occurred by day 57 however for the c2si microcosms 80 degradation had occurred by day 57 with respect to headspace pressure a decrease occurred over the first 35 40 days reaching minimum pressures of 1 9 to 1 4 psi for all microcosms the rate of methanol degradation and pressure decrease corresponded well with each other during this time showing high rates initially and decreasing over time following day 35 40 headspace pressures gradually increased approaching values between 1 4 and 0 8 psi at the end of the experiment headspace composition showed a decrease in o2 from atmospheric levels to non detectable concentrations during the first 35 40 days accompanied by an increase in co2 to 2 within the microcosms the observed decrease in methanol concentrations and headspace pressure as well as changes in gas composition are indicative of aerobic degradation being a substantial driver of methanol degradation at low initial concentrations then transitioning to an anaerobic system the average rate of degradation was estimated based on the elapsed time between the initiation of the experiment until complete meoh degradation table 5 consistent with previous observations the average rate of degradation was 1 7 1 8 mg l 1 day 1 and 1 5 mg l 1 day 1 for the c2 sa and c2si microcosms respectively goldsmith 1985 therefore the rate of degradation was similar in both sediment types 3 1 2 c3 microcosms in the c3 microcosms meoh concentrations initially declined very slowly during the first 30 41 days for the sand fig 2 and 41 days for the silt fig 3 respectively the system transitioned to anaerobic conditions reflected in the immediate drop in headspace pressure and o2 composition in the first 20 days while minor degradation of methanol occurred relative to the initial concentration following this transition degradation remained slow and is herein referred to as a lag period as a result of the system adjusting to the newly established reducing conditions following this lag period methanol degradation was relatively rapid in the sand 90 degradation of methanol had occurred after 85 days and in the silt after 121 140 days degradation beyond 90 methanol depletion slowed considerably with complete degradation occurring after 181 and 150 days for the c3 sa a and c3 sa b microcosms respectively and 136 and 238 days for the c3 si a and c3 si b microcosms respectively the average degradation rates table 5 were consistent with previously reported ranges in the literature bondehagen 2010 goldsmith 1985 suflita and mormile 1993 the sand microcosms had average degradation rates between 4 5 and 7 4 mg l 1 day 1 and maximum degradation rates between 18 4 and 29 2 mg l 1 day 1 while the silt microcosms had average degradation rates between 4 4 and 8 8 mg l 1 day 1 and maximum degradation rates between 17 3 and 20 0 mg l 1 day 1 variable degradation progress within a sediment type is likely attributable to sediment sample variability abundance of electron acceptors and microbial community abundance following the transition to anaerobic conditions and the lag period vfas dominated by acetic acid were first observed approximately 46 days after initiation of the c3 sa microcosms and 60 88 days after the initiation of the c3si microcosms concurrent with the period of rapid methanol degradation the formation of acetic acid can be inferred as the point when anaerobic degradation begins following the reactions shown in table 1 the observed lag time to the initiation of vfa production is herein referred to as the time for the onset of anaerobic degradation after an initial rapid increase in acetic acid concentrations the subsequent decrease in acetic acid day 146 was concurrent with a rapid increase in ch4 gas production as evidenced by the temporal evolution of the headspace pressure fig 2 and fig 3 in the sand microcosms maximum acetic acid concentrations of approximately 100 mg l 1 were observed while the silt microcosms produced much higher concentrations of acetic acid reaching 1000 1200 mg l 1 this finding presents further evidence of differences of the degradation processes within the different aquifer materials the silt provides more favourable conditions for acetate production whereas in the sand acetate production occurs but is rapidly transformed to ch4 concentrations of butyrate and propionate were negligible in comparison to acetate concentrations throughout the experiments headspace pressure fig 2c and d and fig 3c and d for both the sand and silt show similar behavior decreasing during o2 consumption as low as 1 8 psi and 2 1 psi for the sand and silt microcosms respectively and acetic acid production and then increasing as acetic acid concentrations decline as high as 18 psi and 12 psi for the sand and silt respectively for the sand microcosms this non monotonicity is observed at 66 73 days and for the silt microcosms at 164 175 days the generated gas was predominantly ch4 making up between 65 7 and 73 2 and 66 0 to 67 3 for the headspace gas composition for the sand and silt respectively using the generated pressure and headspace composition the ch4 production rate per kg of sediment was calculated to be 8 0 8 8 mg kg 1 day 1 for the sand microcosms and 7 3 10 mg kg 1 day 1 for the silt cation analysis showed that ca and mg concentrations increased during the period of active vfa production fig 2e and f and fig 3e and f and spiked parallel with acetic acid increases the concurrent spike in ca and mg and acetic acid concentrations was more evident in the silt microcosms fig 2e and f ca and mg concentrations in the sand microcosms increased to concentrations of 25 mg l 1 and 10 mg l 1 respectively whereas in the silt microcosm concentrations reached 250 mg l 1 and 50 mg l 1 respectively fig 3e and f confirming that carbonates are present in both sediment types but also suggesting a higher abundance of carbonates in the silt in line with results of the elemental analysis of the sediments other analytes fe k mn na and s showed little change over the duration of the experiment most notably electron acceptors on the redox ladder including fe and mn did not go above the detection limit or exceeded 6 ppm respectively indicating that reductive dissolution of fe and mn oxides was not significant in the c3 microcosms 3 1 3 c4 microcosms a decline in meoh concentrations or changes in headspace pressures were not observed for the c4 sa microcosms over the time period of the study 780 days these microcosms were therefore excluded from analysis this lack of methanol degradation is likely due to the high methanol concentrations inhibiting native microbes in the sand sediments and causing a lag period exceeding the duration of the experiments in contrast methanol degradation was observed in the silt microcosms despite the elevated methanol concentrations c4 si a initially showed marginal degradation that lasted approximately 350 days transitioning into a period of high methanol degradation rates after approximately 400 days this rapid degradation slowed complete methanol degradation was achieved after 577 days in the duplicate microcosm c4 si b marginal meoh degradation occurred for a short period of time 50 days followed by a period of slow meoh degradation that lasted approximately 270 days with a subsequent period of rapid meoh degradation although the microcosms showed different degradation rates the times when complete methanol degradation were reached were similar for both replicates a and b 577 and 525 days respectively the average degradation rates were within the ranges reported in the literature average degradation rate between 17 5 and 17 6 mg l 1 day 1 and maximum degradation rate between 58 7 and 132 0 mg l 1 day 1 bondehagen 2010 goldsmith 1985 suflita and mormile 1993 vfa production in the c4si microcosms showed a stepwise increase in acetic acid during methanol degradation for both replicates acetic acid was detected after 87 days for the c4 si a microcosm fig 4a acetic acid was produced until approximately day 150 and then concentrations were stable at 2200 mg l 1 between day 150 and 322 following this plateau acetic acid rapidly increased to concentrations of 8000 mg l 1 on day 420 and then stabilized again between day 420 and 518 at this point the system transitioned towards acetic acid degradation and complete consumption occurred by day 576 this stepwise increase was also observed in c4 si b fig 4b however three less distinct plateaus in acetic acid concentrations were observed between day 87 and 664 complete consumption of acetic acid was observed by day 702 in addition concentrations of butyric acid were observed with maximum concentrations between 50 and 115 mg l 1 over the duration of the experiments for duplicates a and b respectively for c4 si a fig 4c the initial acetic acid increase occurred during the period of stable headspace pressure as observed in c3 microcosms interestingly the pressure was observed to increase coincident with the increase of acetic acid between days 322 and 420 it was also observed that on day 403 ch4 composition in the headspace reached 88 despite acetic acid concentrations continuing to increase the pressure then stabilized 46 psi above atmospheric pressure concurrent with the peak acetic acid concentrations between days 420 and 518 finally the pressure increased to a maximum value of 127 psi during the complete consumption of acetate from the microcosm using the generated pressure and headspace composition the ch4 production rate per kg of sediment was calculated to be 7 6 mg kg 1 day 1 for the initial increase in pressure and 13 3 mg kg 1 day 1 for the second increase a shift in the composition of the headspace was observed following day 403 when ch4 was seen to decrease to 70 and co2 increased to 26 similar correlations between pressure increase and acetate consumption were seen for c4 si b ca and mg concentrations for c4 si a c4 si b again showed similar but less distinct trends increased to 660 ppm and 232 ppm respectively by day 232 and then stabilized similar to acetic acid until day 361 after this period ca and mg rapidly increased reaching up to 1800 ppm and 200 ppm respectively unlike in the c3 microcosms fe and mn concentrations also increased in the c4 silt microcosms after day 361 reaching concentrations on the order of 100 mg l 1 in the case of fe implying that reductive dissolution took place in the c4 microcosms the fact that an increase in fe and mn was only seen in the c4 microcosms suggests that fe and mn originated in fact from reductive dissolution and not from the dissolution of carbonates since carbonate dissolution occurred in both the c3 and c4 microcosms as the concentrations of acetic acid declined ca fe mg and mn concentrations also decreased other analytes k na and s showed little change over the course of the experiment 3 1 4 c5 microcosms degradation of methanol was not observed for c5 experiments in the sand and the silt confirmed by a lack of changes in headspace pressures and gas composition over the duration of the experiment 780 days the high initial methanol concentration is suspected to have effectively sterilized the native microbes within the sediments leading to an inability to degrade methanol over the recorded time period although degradation did not occur over the 780 day duration of the experiments it may be possible that methanol degradation eventually proceeds assuming remnant microorganisms are able to recover from initial exposure and establish an adapted community structure 3 2 microcosm csia csia was performed on the generated gases in the microcosms for Œ¥13c in co2 and ch4 and Œ¥2h in ch4 after decommissioning the initial isotopic composition of the meoh used for the experiments was 45 7 and 103 1 for Œ¥13c and Œ¥2h respectively csia analysis showed that both c and h isotopes for ch4 were more negative than in meoh and that Œ¥ 13c was more positive in the co2 gas generated than in the feedstock meoh fig 5 as expected the results are indicative of enrichment of the lighter isotopes in ch4 during the process of microbially mediated degradation for Œ¥13c in co2 the most positive signature was seen in the c4 silt microcosms reaching 3 4 o whereas in the c3 sand microcosms the values were measured between 29 5 and 27 5 o and in the silt microcosms values of 22 3 o the more positive signature of Œ¥13c in co2 in the c4si microcosms is indicative of co2 reduction these results also suggest that co2 reduction is not a dominant process in the c3 microcosms implying that more highly reducing conditions developed in the c4 microcosms relative to the c3 microcosms it is also possible that carbonate mineral dissolution contributed to the more positive Œ¥13c signature brand et al 2014 however dissolved ca concentrations suggest that this process took place both in the c3 and c4 microcosms compare figs 2 4 3 3 microbial community structure and activity following sample processing and quality control 3424 otus were used for all downstream analyses calculating chao1 indices to generate rarefaction curves revealed the slope for each sample approaching a plateau after approximately 900 unique otus for the sand microcosms and 600 unique otus for the silt microcosms this suggests that the majority of the microbial diversity present in each sample was represented with the exception of extremely rare taxa to survey the microbial community structure among and between c2 and c3 microcosm experiments non metric multidimensional scaling nmds was conducted using otu distributions normalized using a variance stabilizing transformation a separation between the silt and sand microcosms as well as separation away from the original reference samples for each methanol treatment was observed fig s1 indicator species analysis with 1000 permutations was then performed to determine specific otus associated with each condition using a threshold indicator value 0 7 and p value 0 05 a total of 48 indicator otus were identified for the sand microcosm and 28 for the silt microcosms indicator otus associated with the silt microcosm were primarily affiliated with methanomicrobia methanogenic archaea and acidobacteria while indicator otus associated with sand were affiliated with a larger variety of bacterial phyla such as acidobacteria firmicutes chloroflexi and proteobacteria supplementary material table s1 to better resolve microbial community structure the taxonomic composition of the community was evaluated at the phylum and order level fig 6 euryarchaeota proteobacteria acidobacteria actinobacteria firmicutes and chloroflexi were the dominant phyla in both rdna abundance and rrna potential activity fractions in all methanol microcosm experiments fig s2 evaluating the phylum level taxonomic composition across the c2 and c3 methanol treatments revealed strong similarities in both the sand and silt microcosms as well as shifts in the community structure upon exposure indeed comparing reference samples to those exposed to the methanol treatments revealed shifts in the relative abundance and potential activity of the dominant taxonomic groups fig 6 microbial community structure within the c2 and c3 microcosm experiments was consistent with a shift towards one carbon utilizing and methanogenic taxa a comparison between reference and treated samples revealed enrichment in gammaproteobacteria acidobacteria firmicutes and methanogenic euryarchaeota accompanied by a decrease in actinobacteria further evaluation of these groups at the order level revealed key players in aerobic and anaerobic degradation processes including pseudomonadales clostridiales bacillales and methanosarcinales kolb 2009 rajala and bomberg 2017 the presence of methanosarcinales is especially relevant in conjunction with significant levels of methane gas generated within the microcosm experiments alongside increases in acetic acid concentrations indeed archaea affiliated with the methanosarcinales are known to perform acetoclastic methanogenesis where acetate is the primary substrate converted to methane vanwonterghem et al 2016 the shift of the microbial community structure to one dominated by methanogens and acetogens is expected since it is commonly observed in studies quantifying community structure evolution in response to the decomposition of alcohol blended fuels c√°piro et al 2008 ma et al 2013 2015 mcleod et al 2018 nelson et al 2010 the increased abundance and potential activity of this group alongside geochemical characterization suggests acetoclastic methanogenesis as the dominant process in methane generation this is especially true within the silt microcosm experiments as methanosarcinales were the dominant group identified in the euryarchaetoa phylum for the sand microcosm methanocellales were also enriched in the treated samples up to 10 fold when compared to reference samples the presence of methanocellales within the sand microcosms but not in the silt suggests that there were differences in the microbial community composition of each material from the start this is noteworthy as it highlights the importance of the physical environment in shaping microbial community composition and ultimately function in the context of blended fuel attenuation processes 3 4 discussion of methanol degradation pathways and effects on gas production patterns as expected methanol was readily degraded in the presence of o2 suggesting that in aerobic systems with a ready supply of o2 methanol will not be persistent however when o2 becomes limiting a transition to anaerobic degradation causes a lag time in methanol degradation the duration of which is dependent on the initial concentration of methanol and sediment type overall the degradation products expected are acetate and eventually ch4 and co2 predominately in gaseous form although the resulting carbon species following complete degradation of methanol were found to be the same for the c3 and c4 microcosms the degradation pathway differed affecting the evolution and timing of gas production both pathways will be described below utilizing a mass balance of carbon within the system mass balances were conducted by comparing the measured amount of carbon transformed to other forms including vfas co2 and ch4 to the expected amount based on the concentration of methanol remaining in the system these calculations showed that the mass balance was closed for all microcosms with a maximum discrepancy over the duration of the experiments of 19 this difference is considered acceptable based on the varied sampling frequency of all analytes and expected analytical accuracy both the c3 sa and c3si microcosms saw similar degradation pathways and overall degradation products however the c3si microcosms exhibited slower degradation therefore the phases of degradation are more distinct based on the sampling frequency for that reason the description of methanol degradation utilizes the data from the c3 si a microcosms three distinct phases occurred fig 3a in phase 1 0 to 43 days the system transitioned from aerobic conditions degrading methanol by reaction 1 in table 1 producing co2 until all available o2 was consumed following the complete consumption of o2 from the system a lag period was observed where minimal changes occurred because of difficulties distinguishing between the consumption of o2 and the lag period these stages are considered one phase following phase 1 phase 2 day 43 to 160 saw rapid degradation of methanol in this phase the main product measured were acetic acid accompanied by an increase in ca2 interestingly there was no increase in co2 or ch4 during this time based on the mass balance methanol was being degraded to acetic acid by reaction 8 in table 1 consuming co2 simultaneously because of the acidity generated carbonate dissolution was also occurring 1 cac o 3 2 h c a 2 c o 2 h 2 o this leads to a net reaction in this phase of 2 4 c h 3 oh 1 5 cac o 3 0 5 c o 2 3 c h 3 co o 1 5 c a 2 3 5 h 2 o therefore by eq 2 there is demand for co2 from mass balance it was found that sufficient co2 was generated in phase 1 from aerobic degradation and initially present in the system atmospheric co2 to drive this reaction forward completely degrading the remaining methanol in the system the final phase phase 3 occurred from day 160 to 218 when the experiment was completed in this phase acetic acid was consumed and ch4 and co2 were produced from the mass balance it is evident that during phase 3 acetic acid was consumed following reaction 4 in table 1 transforming to ch4 and co2 however ca2 also decreased suggesting that carbonate precipitation was occurring by 3 c a 2 c o 2 h 2 o cac o 3 2 h overall this gives a net reaction for phase 3 of 4 2 c h 3 co o c a 2 h 2 o 2 c h 4 c o 2 cac o 3 combining phases 2 and 3 together gives the overall degradation pathway for the anaerobic degradation the majority of degradation overall the reaction is 5 4 c h 3 oh 3 c h 4 c o 2 2 h 2 o therefore overall 75 of the carbon in the system was converted to ch4 and 25 to co2 controlled by the degradation sequence production of these gases was delayed but then occurred rapidly mass balance shows that for all c3 microcosms 74 81 of the mass remaining at the end of the experiment was in the form of ch4 and 19 26 in the form of co2 this presents strong evidence that this was the overall reaction pathway for the c3 microcosms indicating a strong potential for delayed and short lived rapid gas production both sediment types showed a delayed response in terms of the onset of gas production however timing was different and the rate of gas production also varied between sediment types the c4si microcosms saw a similar overall degradation as the c3 microcosms however the intermediary phases differed to describe this degradation the c4 si a microcosm will be used as the phases are distinct in the c4 si a microcosm six distinct phases occurred identified by hashed lines in fig 4a the first phase was from 0 to 87 days when methanol degradation occurred by aerobic oxidation reaction 1 in table 1 which resulted in a marginal decrease in methanol concentration and complete consumption of o2 from the system forming co2 the second phase was observed between days 88 and 239 overall increases in acetic acid and ca2 occurred similar to phase 2 of the c3 microcosms mass balance results suggest that the net reaction occurring here follows eq 2 above where methanol was degraded to acetic acid involving co2 reduction with a simultaneous increase of ca2 as a result of carbonate dissolution for the c4 microcosms this phase is limited by the amount of co2 in the system therefore once the co2 initially present in the system from the atmosphere from aerobic degradation and supplied by carbonate dissolution was consumed the reaction could not progress this leads to phase 3 which was a lag period from day 239 to day 358 during this phase minimal meoh degradation or changes in product concentrations were observed and it appears that the system was adapting to the new redox conditions limited by the availability of co2 following the lag period after 358 days acetic acid ch4 and ca2 increased and meoh rapidly decreased this constitutes phase 4 which occurred from day 358 to 420 based on the mass balance at this time fermentation of methanol to acetate and molecular hydrogen reaction 6 in table 1 occurred the generated acidity from this reaction led to additional carbonate dissolution eq 1 producing co2 finally this co2 underwent reduction to ch4 reaction in table 1 the net reaction for these three syntrophic reactions is 6 4 c h 3 oh cac o 3 2 c h 3 co o c h 4 c a 2 3 h 2 o although studies which look at the thermodynamics of methanol degradation are sparse insight can be gained from the literature on ethanol degradation to support degradation in phase 4 this finding is consistent with dolfing 2001 based on the findings of barker 1936 who found that thermodynamics favour acetogenic degradation rather than complete oxidation to ch4 under the conditions expected in methanogenic systems in addition csia data shows significantly more positive Œ¥13c in co2 providing additional evidence for the occurrence of co2 reduction therefore it is likely that degradation occurred by fermentation carbonate dissolution and co2 reduction computing the total mass of carbon in the form of meoh and carbon released from carbonate dissolution to the mass of carbon in the form of vfas ch4 in the headspace and remaining in the form of meoh finds that the mass balance is closed within 6 comparing the amount of acetate and ch4 shows that in the experimental system 79 of carbon was in the form of acetate and 21 of carbon was in the form of ch4 based on the proposed degradation pathway eq 6 the theoretical carbon products should be 80 acetate and 20 ch4 providing additional evidence for the validity of this hypothesis following day 420 more than 90 of meoh degradation occurred this led to phase 5 from day 420 to 519 which corresponds to another lag period this lag period was characterized by minimal meoh degradation further evidenced by headspace pressure plateauing during this time the remaining meoh 10 continued to be degraded by eq 6 but at a marginal rate this period also appears to represent a transition of the system due to the native microbial communities shifting to a community favourable for acetoclastic methanogenesis in the final phase phase 6 which occurred from day 519 to 780 decommissioning all methanol was degraded and acetate was then consumed by acetoclastic methanogenesis reaction 4 in table 1 the co2 produced then drives the precipitation of carbonates 7 c a 2 c o 2 h 2 o cac o 3 2 h this gives a net reaction of 8 2 c h 3 co o c a 2 h 2 o 2 c h 4 c o 2 cac o 3 combining eqs 6 and 8 gives the overall net reaction for the anaerobic degradation of meoh in the c4 microcosms which ends up as the same overall reaction as the c3 microcosm eq 5 mass balance shows that for both c4 si a and c4 si b 76 and 74 of the mass remaining at the end of the experiment was in the form of ch4 and 24 and 26 in the form of co2 respectively therefore strongly supporting this overall degradation pathway the implication of this more complex degradation pathway in comparison to the c3 microcosm is that gas production is more significantly delayed and can occur in multiple stages making it more difficult to anticipate when and at what rate gas production and ch4 release might occur although the time lag to the onset of methanogenesis is longer than for the corresponding c3 microcosms the rate of production is ultimately higher leading to significant gas accumulation in the closed microcosms methanol degradation forms three main products acetate ch4 and co2 however acetate is an intermediary which in late stages will be degraded to ch4 and co2 which is consistent with previous work on ethanol degradation freitas et al 2010 this reaction pathway was consistent between both the c3 and c4 microcosms however it is clear that the reducing conditions as a result of the initial concentration are different and lead to varied phases within the overall pathway the fact that no degradation was observed for the c4 sand microcosms points to the effect of meoh toxicity at this concentration level in the sand despite shorter lag times for gas production in the sand microcosms relative to the silt microcosm in the c3 experiments these observations further illustrate the challenges associated with anticipating degradation pathways and gas production rates as a function of sediment type and meoh concentrations 4 conclusions the degradation of methanol in groundwater systems was studied by means of microcosm experiments the experiments conducted show that methanol degradation in groundwater systems is expected to occur under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions as the systems transition from aerobic to anaerobic conditions a lag time in methanol degradation and associated gas production is observed the magnitude of which increases between sand and silt sediments and increased initial concentration of methanol after this lag the rate of degradation is dependent on the aquifer material and initial concentration of methanol released degradation was observed in the sand material at concentrations as high as 1000 ppm and in silt as high as 10 000 ppm above these concentrations no degradation was observed over the time periods studied assessment of the degradation by products found that under anaerobic conditions acetate ch4 and co2 are expected to be formed acetate is however an intermediate product which is then further degraded to ch4 and co2 the overall anaerobic degradation of methanol was consistent between the c3 and c4 microcosms however the initial concentration affected reducing conditions altering intermediate degradation phases co2 was a limiting factor in the oxidation of methanol in the c3 microcosms initial co2 abundance and the co2 generation from carbonate dissolution was sufficient to drive complete methanol degradation to acetate however the c4 microcosm had insufficient initial abundance of co2 to degrade the higher amount of meoh driving the system further down on the redox ladder leading to fermentation coupling this transition with carbonate dissolution as a result of the produced acidity caused the production of ch4 during methanol degradation which was unexpected based on previous work on ethanol degradation freitas et al 2010 interestingly carbonate dissolution played a significant role in this system in non carbonate aquifer systems the degradation may be significantly different such that minimal ch4 production would occur during methanol degradation and acidity would not be buffered therefore it is clear that the reducing conditions i e position on the redox ladder will influence the intermediary product formation in methanol contaminated systems however the common end products are ch4 and co2 differences across media type and across duplicated microcosms suggest that media heterogeneity influence degradation progression although the microcosms are presumed to be homogeneous and well mixed variations occurred heterogeneity will affect the distribution of methanol microbial communities and electron acceptors within an aquifer therefore it is expected that methanol degradation and by product generation will be variable within the subsurface in addition although high concentrations of methanol were observed to effectively sterilize the sediments of native microbial communities heterogeneity of the subsurface has the potential to mitigate this inhibiting factor for example if a high concentration spill were to occur it is possible that this sterilization could occur in the vicinity of the bulk methanol however along the edges of the plume where mixing and dilution occurs favourable conditions for microbial communities can be expected to develop leading to the degradation of methanol subsequently allowing for degradation to continue as the plume becomes more dilute overall the study results show that gas generation in response to meoh degradation is delayed is a function of sediment type is affected by initial meoh concentrations levels and can occur in a stepwise fashion during short time intervals and at rapid rates it may be that distinct phases of gas formation at a spill site are not as significant as seen in the c4 silt microcosms studied here due to heterogeneities of natural sediments on the spill scale which may lead to a more evenly distributed gas production based on the results of this study it is expected that methanol will be readily biodegraded in aquifers with average degradation rates ranging from 1 5 17 6 mg l 1 day 1 similar to rates expected for ethanol these high rates coupled with expected plume dilution suggest that methanol will not be persistent and can be oxidized from the subsurface in less than 500 days based on the sediments and concentrations used in this study the results also suggest that the aesthetic impacts e g vfas to the aquifer will be temporary as they are quickly degraded to ch4 and co2 however it is expected that substantial ch4 generation at high rates 7 3 to 13 mg kg 1 day 1 will occur during degradation possibly in a stepwise pattern that is difficult to predict this ch4 can present hazards down gradient and has been shown at sites utilizing bioaugmentation to affect the flow field within the groundwater system e g gas production reduces the relative hydraulic conductivity and can lead to flow conduiting ch4 and co2 production might however allow for monitoring of complete methanol degradation by means of surface effluxes allowing for
