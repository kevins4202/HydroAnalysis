9255,polyethylene film pef cannot retain ineffective precipitation 10 mm in drylands and pef residues in farmland have detrimental impacts on soil health thus water permeable plastic film wpf that can retain ineffective precipitation and biodegradable film bf that can be degraded were developed however the yield performance using wpf and bf varied a lot in different crops and experimental sites as compared with pef here we evaluated the applicability of wpf and bf as alternatives to pef on millet sorghum and corn with different growth periods on the northern loess plateau of china our results showed that compared with pef ineffective precipitation was successfully preserved and soil water storage was 13 19 mm higher under wpf furthermore the activities of urease alkaline phosphatase catalase and contents of soil no3 n available phosphorus were also higher under wpf due to the improved soil water conditions and mitigated soil temperature consequently the yields of the three crops were 5 18 higher under wpf the yield under bf did not decrease in millet while it was 8 15 lower in sorghum and corn than that under pef when a large area of bf cracks appeared sorghum and corn were in the middle growth period with a low leaf area index lai and the rainy season did not come yet but for millet it coincided with the rainy season in its late growth period with a high lai therefore compared with pef soil water storage was 9 30 mm lower under bf in sorghum and corn during the middle growth stage which resulted in lower soil enzyme activities and nutrient contents in conclusion as an alternative to pef wpf application is favorable in areas with high ineffective precipitation and bf application is not suitable for crops with long growth period and low lai keywords soil water

that increases water productivity wp and crop production in areas where water input or water resources are scarce tiwari et al 2003 kasirajan and ngouajio 2012 kader et al 2017 pef mulching can decrease soil evaporation and improve soil hydrothermal conditions greatly mo et al 2016 ruiz et al 2020 it was reported that the wp and yield of staple and cash crops can be improved by 20 30 and 20 60 respectively by pef mulching liu et al 2014 accordingly pef mulching is used extensively worldwide and the global use of pef for agriculture reached approximately 7 4 million tons in 2019 sintim and flury 2017 le moine and ferry 2019 as the largest user of pef in the world the consumption of pef has increased to 14 7 105 tons per year and its cover area has reached 184 105 ha in china expanding from cash crops to staple foods and extending from northern arid regions to southern high mountains and cold regions daryanto et al 2017 xue et al 2017 gao et al 2018 pef mulching can significantly improve crop yield and wp especially in rainfed agriculture without a water source for irrigation in dryland for example on the loess plateau a typical dryland of china pef mulching combined with the improvement of agronomic practices can more than double the crop yield cui et al 2018 precipitation is the only water source in rainfed agriculture thus it is crucial to store more precipitation in farmland through pef mulching in dryland li et al 2016 mo et al 2016 under pef mulching precipitation cannot penetrate directly through the pef it generally slips from the side of the film and then infiltrates the soil when the amount of precipitation is small the precipitation is easily retained on the film surface and eventually evaporates thus ineffective precipitation precipitation below 10 mm or even a low amount of effective precipitation is difficult to be preserved in soil by pef mulching however in some drylands the frequency of ineffective precipitation events could account for 70 of annual precipitation events accordingly the total amount of ineffective precipitation each year could reach 100 mm which accounts for a large proportion of annual precipitation especially for areas with only 300 400 mm of annual precipitation yao et al 1998 thus how to use this precipitation effectively can significantly impact the further improvement of wp and the productivity of dryland crops to improve the use efficiency of ineffective precipitation and further increase crop yield in drylands a water permeable plastic film wpf was developed on the surface of the wpf there are densely distributed holes with tiny diameters once precipitation falls on the film the holes open by gravity pressure and precipitation passes through the wpf after permeation the holes close again to reduce evaporation yao 2000 theoretically compared with pef mulching wpf mulching can further increase crop yield by providing more water for crops through the utilization of ineffective precipitation however in the drylands of china wpf was not widely applied in farmland since the crop yields under wpf mulching did not consistently increase as greatly as expected as compared with pef mulching fan et al 2006 guo et al 2007 xia et al 2016 yan et al 2020 previous studies speculated that the inconsistent effects of wpf on crop yield may be fundamentally determined by the amount of ineffective precipitation that occurs during different growth stages in various crop species shan et al 2017 yan et al 2020 therefore it is necessary to assess the applicability of wpf as an alternative to pef in different crops in dryland farmland in addition to the ineffectual use of ineffective precipitation pef also has a shortcoming that cannot be ignored it is difficult or impossible to degrade thus large amounts of pef residues are burned or left in the soil by farmers because they are not willing to spend the time and money to recycle it which could result in detrimental effects on the environment scarascia mugnozza et al 2004 briassoulis 2006 due to the failure of recovery the residual amount of pef can reach 60 349 kg ha 1 in farmland dong et al 2013 film residues can disrupt soil structure entangle crop roots reduce soil permeability and suppress the movement of heat water and nutrients in the soil as well as inhibit the activities of soil microorganisms jiang et al 2017 li et al 2020 qi et al 2020 it has been shown that the film residues resulted in a 5 5 23 decrease in staple crop yield and a 14 6 59 2 decrease in cash crop yield liu et al 2008 dong et al 2013 the negative effects of pef application led to the gradual evolution of the white revolution into white pollution to alleviate the negative effects of white pollution researchers have tried to develop emerging biodegradable films bfs which consist mostly of polysaccharides and can be easily degraded in situ by soil microorganisms kijchavengkul et al 2008 moreno and moreno 2008 sintim and flury 2017 wang et al 2019 in recent years people have attempted to apply bf in various staple and cash crops around the world the effects of bf mulching on crop yield showed quite different results when compared with pef mulching some studies showed that bf could be a promising alternative to pef while other studies suggested that the application of bf poses a great risk of yield loss compared to pef mulching anzalone et al 2010 ghimire et al 2018 yan et al 2020 one explanation could be that the timing of bf degradation is difficult to control if the bf degrades too early then the area of bare soil will be enlarged and the soil evaporation will be increased in other words bf mulching can decrease soil evaporation and improve soil hydrothermal conditions during the early growth stage however these effects will disappear at the late growth stage due to the degradation of the bf therefore some studies suggested that bf may be a suitable candidate in crops with short growth periods yan et al 2016 2020 thus as a highly anticipated alternative to pef it is imperative to verify the applicability of bf to crops with different growth periods and understand what causes the discrepant applicability of bf among different crops the loess plateau is a typical dryland of china in this area the amount of annual precipitation ranges from 250 to 650 mm and annual evapotranspiration could reach 1300 1800 mm furthermore no irrigation is available because groundwater resources are very sparse and deep yang et al 2021 thus pef mulching accounts for 40 of the total arable lands on the loess plateau koskei et al 2021 consequently the amount of pef residues in soil is as high as 75 300 kg ha 1 which endangers food security and soil health dong et al 2013 liu et al 2014 zhao et al 2021 thus it is very important to develop bf to replace pef for the sustainable development of agriculture and environmental protection in addition on the loess plateau the amount of ineffective precipitation can reach 100 mm which accounts for 15 40 of the annual precipitation each year yao et al 1998 further increasing the utilization of these ineffective precipitation may be an important way to further improve crop yield chinese agronomists have made many attempts to develop the application of wpf and bf on crops however replacing pef with wpf or bf is still controversial different crops have different growth periods growth characteristics and planting times and their requirements for hydrothermal conditions are quite different therefore instead of pef mulching wpf and bf mulching could be applied on some crops in certain areas in this study we investigated the effects of pef wpf and bf on yield of three crops millet sorghum and corn with different growth periods and growth characteristics in yuling county shannxi province located in the northern loess plateau meanwhile the differences in soil hydrothermal and nutrient conditions among different mulching treatments were also studied in doing so we aimed to 1 evaluate the applicability of wpf and bf as alternatives to pef on different crops in this area and 2 clarify what causes the discrepant applicability of wpf and bf among different crops we believe that our results will provide useful information to the partial substitution of pef by wpf and bf 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the field experiment was initiated in april 2019 and lasted until october 2020 at xiejiagou agro ecological experimental station 110 11 e 38 31 n 1180 m elevation which is situated in a typical

precipitation is 404 mm and the groundwater level is 50 m below the soil surface the soil texture of the experimental plots was sandy loam before sowing in 2019 we randomly collected soil samples from twelve spots in the experimental field to determine the basic soil chemical and physical properties in the 0 20 cm soil layers which are presented in table 1 the bulk density was 1 35 g cm 3 soil organic matter was 5 52 g kg 1 total nitrogen content was 0 04 available phosphate was 18 6 mg kg 1 and available potassium was 170 mg kg 1 during the experimental years the annual precipitation was 483 and 437 mm in 2019 wet year and 2020 normal year respectively fig s1 2 2 experimental design and field management the experiment was conducted following a randomized complete block design with four treatments i e mulching with polyethylene film pef mulching with water permeable plastic film wpf mulching with biodegradable film bf and no mulching nm the three films were 0 008 mm thick 80 cm wide and white shanxi academy of agricultural sciences taigu china and the films were tailored and applied to farmland based on the row spacing of different crops water permeable plastic film was made from polyethylene and water permeable additives with 5 10 µm pore size and 12 mm cm2 h 23 101 3 kpa penetration rate the biodegradable film was made of starch polymer with an induction period of 60 80 d each treatment was replicated thrice as plots and each plot was 6 10 m millet sorghum and corn were planted in rows without mulching or under strip film in each experimental year the planting densities of millet sorghum and corn were 400 000 100 000 and 62 400 plants ha 1 with 50 50 and 60 cm row spacing respectively the specific growth periods day and the precipitation during those periods of the three crops are shown in table 2 the cultivars of millet sorghum and corn were jingu 21 jinza 22 and dafeng 30 respectively manure at a rate of 15 000 kg hm 2 and compound fertilizer contains 20 nitrogen 15 phosphorus and 10 potassium at a rate of 600 kg hm 2 were applied before plowing each year the manure consisted of sheep dung containing 246 g kg 1 organic matter 20 5 g kg 1 total nitrogen 20 1 g kg 1 total phosphorus 1 99 mg kg 1 no3 n and 1 02 mg kg 1 nh4 n 2 3 measurements and methods 2 3 1 soil water storage actual crop evapotranspiration and wp the soil water storage in the 0 200 cm soil depth at the sowing jointing flowering and harvest stages was measured and calculated according to the following equations burgess et al 2014 1 sws swc bd sd where sws is the soil water storage mm swc is the soil water content w w which was measured by the oven drying method gardner 1986 and bd and sd are the soil bulk density g cm 3 and soil depth cm respectively the actual crop evapotranspiration eta of the three crops during different growth stages was calculated as follows hati et al 2006 pereira et al 2021 2 eta p sws r d where p sws r and d are precipitation the change in sws at the 0 200 cm soil depth surface runoff and deep leakage respectively during a period in eq 2 surface runoff and deep leakage can be neglected because they rarely occur in this area the wp was calculated as follows hati et al 2006 fernández et al 2020 3 wp grain yield eta 2 3 2 soil temperature in each plot the soil temperature at 5 10 and 20 cm soil depths was automatically recorded every half hour using an automatic soil temperature recorder beijing boyuanhuida technology co ltd beijing china during the whole growing season of the three crops we did not test the soil temperature below a 20 cm depth because there were almost no differences in soil temperature among the different mulching films when the depth reached 20 cm gu et al 2018 2 3 3 soil no3 n and available phosphorus contents fresh soil samples were collected twice from a 20 cm soil depth in each plot at the jointing flowering and harvest stages kcl solution 1 mol l 1 was used to extract soil samples by shaking them for 1 h and the extracted solution was filtered through filter paper keeney and bruner 1966 the soil no3 n content was determined in an aa3 automatic continuous flow analyzer skalar breda the netherlands the available phosphorus was extracted by 0 5 mol l 1 nahco3 olsen et al 1954 and then analyzed by a high resolution digital colorimeter autoanalyzer skalar breda the netherlands 2 3 4 soil enzyme activities soil urease alkaline phosphatase and catalase play important roles in soil nitrogen and phosphorus transformation and their availability to crops adetunji et al 2017 wang et al 2018 2020 therefore the three enzymes were selected in this study to evaluate the effect of different mulching treatments on soil fertility at the jointing flowering and harvest stages fresh soil samples were collected from a 20 cm soil depth for soil enzyme activity determination the soil urease activity mg nh4 n 100 g 1 soil 24 hr 1 was measured by indophenol blue method ge

kmno4 g 1 h 1 was measured by back titration method with kmno4 and h2o2 solutions stpniewska et al 2009 2 3 5 aboveground dry matter leaf area index lai and crop yields at the jointing and flowering stages the aboveground plants from two rows 1 m length per row in each millet plot and the aboveground parts of five plants from different rows in each sorghum and corn plot were collected and weighed after oven drying at 80 c for 48 h lai was measured using a lai 2200 canopy analyzer li cor lincoln ne usa from 12 spots in each plot at harvest three times the number of samples than the samples in the above growth stages were collected from each plot and weighed after air drying and seed yield of three crops was also measured 2 4 statistical analyses all data were analyzed using spss 20 0 software ibm company chicago il usa to determine the significant difference among the different treatments during the same growth stage in each year duncan s test p 0 05 was used to compare the means of the four treatments 3 results 3 1 soil water storage and crop evapotranspiration the soil water storage under different treatments is shown in fig 1 in millet compared with nm soil water storage was increased significantly under pef wpf and bf at the tested growth stage compared with that of pef soil water storage was 6 8 13 19 mm higher under wpf and was not lower under bf at both the jointing and flowering stages in sorghum and corn under the bf treatment soil water storage was only increased at the jointing stage compared with nm in addition compared with pef soil water storage under wpf was 5 8 15 23 mm higher at the jointing stage and 3 6 13 18 mm higher at the flowering stage in sorghum and corn in contrast soil water storage was significantly lower under bf than under pef at the flowering stage actual crop evapotranspiration during different growth stages was profoundly affected by different treatments fig 2 from the sowing to the jointing stage eta was greatly decreased by 10 28 8 26 mm 24 42 19 44 mm and 11 24 9 23 mm under pef wpf and bf respectively compared with that under nm compared with the eta of pef the eta of wpf was lower in each year from the jointing to the flowering stage the eta of bf was increased in corn in 2019 and in sorghum in 2020 compared with nm when compared with pef eta was unchanged under wpf but was higher under bf in sorghum and corn in two years from the flowering to the harvest stage eta was increased under pef wpf and bf compared with that of nm and there were no differences in eta among the three mulching treatments 3 2 soil temperature the daily change and the hourly change in soil temperature at soil depths of 5 10 and 20 cm are shown in figs 3 4 and 5 and figs s2 s3 and s4 respectively at the 5 and 10 cm soil depths figs 3 and 4 from the sowing to jointing stages the average soil temperature was 1 04 1 95 0 53 1 46 and 0 91 1 86 higher respectively under pef wpf and bf than under nm compared with pef the average soil temperature was 0 36 0 63 lower under wpf from the jointing to flowering stages the average soil temperature was lower under wpf and bf than under pef from the flowering to the harvest stage the average soil temperature was decreased by 0 21 0 65 under pef and wpf compared with that of nm and it was similar between nm and bf at the 20 cm soil depth fig 5 from the sowing to jointing stage the average soil temperature was increased by 0 45 0 75 0 23 0 49 and 0 41 0 67 under pef wpf and bf respectively compared with that under nm from the jointing to the harvest stages there were fewer differences in the average soil temperature among the three mulching treatments figs s2 s3 and s4 show that the rank order of soil temperature in the daytime under the four treatments was pef bf wpf nm from the sowing to the jointing stage pef wpf bf nm from the jointing to the flowering stage and nm bf pef wpf from the flowering to the harvest stage and these differences gradually decreased with increasing soil depth 3 3 soil no3 n available phosphorus and enzyme activities as shown in figs 6 7 and 8 the soil no3 n content available phosphorus content and enzyme activities were profoundly affected by different treatments at the jointing stage compared with nm the soil no3 n content available phosphorus content and enzyme activities were increased greatly under the three mulching treatments and they were the highest under wpf at the flowering stage in sorghum and corn the soil no3 n content available phosphorus content and enzyme activities did not increase under bf compared with those under nm and they were also the highest under wpf at the harvest stage there were small differences in soil no3 n content and available phosphorus content among the four treatments and in enzyme activities between nm and bf in addition soil enzyme activities were higher under pef and wpf than they were under nm and bf 3 4 aboveground dry mass and leaf area index lai the dynamic changes in aboveground dry mass among different treatments are shown in fig 9 in millet compared with pef the aboveground dry mass under wpf was consistently higher but showed no change under bf in sorghum and corn the aboveground dry mass was also the highest under wpf among the four treatments in addition compared with that of pef the aboveground dry mass was lower under bf at the flowering and harvest stages lai varied largely among different crops or treatments the average lais of the four treatments in millet were 3 13 and 4 91 those in sorghum were 1 91 and 2 80 and those in corn were 2 15 and 3 32 at the jointing and flowering stages respectively compared with that of pef lai was consistently higher under wpf the lai was not different between pef and bf at the jointing stage at the flowering stage there was also no difference in lai between pef and bf in millet however in sorghum and corn the lai was lower under bf than under pef 3 5 crop yield and water productivity wp table 3 shows that the yield increased under the three mulching treatments compared with that under nm the yields were increased by 20 38 34 63 and 20 36 in millet by 19 42 33 62 and 9 20 in sorghum and by 14 24 20 40 and 4 9 in corn under pef wpf and bf respectively compared with those under nm compared with pef the yield of wpf was much higher the yield was not different in millet between pef and bf while it was decreased greatly in sorghum and corn under bf wp showed the highest under wpf and the lowest under nm nm bf pef wpf in addition harvest indexes were higher under pef wpf and bf than those under nm the soil water storage at harvest was also the highest under wpf and the lowest under nm wpf pef bf nm in contrast the eta of the four treatments showed an inverse order which was nm bf pef wpf 4 discussion our two year study showed that compared with the yield of nm the yields of the three mulching treatments were all increased greatly in the three crops table 3 importantly compared with that of pef the yields of the three crops were consistently higher under wpf while although the yield of bf did not decrease in millet it was significantly lower in sorghum and corn therefore wpf could be a competitive alternative to pef while bf could only be a promising alternative to pef in crops with short growth periods such as millet on the northern loess plateau crop yield is profoundly affected by soil water status especially in drylands yang et al 2021 in the two experimental years the amount of ineffective precipitation ranged from 89 to 112 mm during the growing seasons and the proportion of ineffective precipitation from the sowing to jointing jointing to flowering and flowering to harvest stages was 30 36 25 30 mm 15 23 33 53 mm and 15 38 22 30 mm respectively table 2 a large amount of ineffective precipitation was generally lost through evaporation however compared with the soil water storage of pef the soil water storage of wpf was higher at nearly all tested growth stages in the three crops fig 1 indicating that ineffective precipitation was successfully preserved by wpf some studies indicated that crop yield under wpf mulching did not consistently increase as much as expected when compared with the yield under pef mulching fan et al 2006 guo et al 2007 xia et al 2016 yan et al 2020 we speculate that this may be related to the total amount of ineffective precipitation and its distribution characteristics during the growing season the successfully preserved ineffective precipitation also influenced eta under wpf it is well known that during the early growth stage when lai is low and the area of bare soil is large eta could be decreased if the loss of precipitation through evaporation was greatly inhibited chen et al 2010 eberbach and pala 2005 in this study before the jointing stage the amount of ineffective precipitation was 25 30 mm table 2 and the eta of wpf was decreased significantly by 11 23 mm compared with that of pef fig 2 which suggests that the loss of ineffective precipitation through evaporation was greatly reduced under wpf from the jointing to the harvest stage there were 61 83 mm of ineffective precipitation thus logically speaking the eta of wpf should be lower than that of pef however our results show that the eta during this period was not different between that of pef and wpf during the late growth stage large amounts of soil water will be consumed through crop transpiration with increased aboveground dry matter unkovich et al 2018 peng et al 2020 accordingly the amount of crop transpiration accounts for a large proportion of eta during this period and is mainly affected by the plant population jia et al 2018 after the jointing stage aboveground dry matter was consistently higher under wpf than that under pef therefore during the late growth stage a large part of the extra stored ineffective precipitation under wpf may be used for crop transpiration which made the difference in eta disappear between pef and wpf in this study compared with pef the average soil temperature was lower under wpf from the sowing to the flowering stage especially at the 5 cm soil depth figs 3 4 and 5 the hourly variation in soil temperature further shows that the soil temperature was lower from approximately 10 00 a m to 16 00 p m lst when the soil temperature reached 25 30 figs s2 s3 and s4 yao 2000 reported that the densely distributed holes of wpf would open under the effect of high vapor pressure below the film surface when the soil temperature is high and that this characteristic enables wpf to alleviate the damaging effect of high temperature to crop growth the degradation of bf has a great effect on crop yield by influencing soil hydrothermal conditions koskei et al 2021 zhao et al 2021 in this study the degradation of the bf initiated at 60 70 days after sowing das and a large area of cracks appeared at approximately 80 90 das the growth period from the sowing to jointing stage was 54 68 das in the three crops thus soil temperature soil water storage and eta were not different significantly between pef and bf during this period from the jointing to flowering stage the growth periods of millet sorghum and corn were 54 jointing 88 flowering 61 108 and 60 111 das respectively table 3 during the period when a large area of cracks appeared millet was almost in the flowering stage with an lai value of approximately 5 and had entered the rainy season while sorghum and corn had not entered the rainy season and were still in the middle stage between the jointing and flowering stages with an lai value of only 2 5 figs s1 and 10 the large area of cracks in the bf can result in the loss of soil water through evaporation from bare soil especially in the middle stages if there were fewer precipitation events and the crop canopy was not large enough to cover the bare soil eberbach and pala 2005 gu et al 2017 aldien et al 2018 therefore compared with that of pef the soil water storage under bf at the flowering stage did not decrease in millet but was much lower in sorghum and corn fig 1 furthermore from the jointing to the flowering stage eta also did not differ between pef and bf in millet while in sorghum and corn eta was higher under bf than under pef indicating that more soil water was lost through evaporation it should be noted here that if the lai of a crop is large enough to cover nearly all bare soil during the early growth stage then the degradation of the bf may not lead to significant increase in soil evaporation and worse soil water hydrothermal conditions at later stages previous studies have indicated that soil enzyme activities can be greatly increased under greater soil water storage and soil temperature by regulating the substrate availability for nutrient turnover related enzymes lópez et al 2014 pérez guzmán et al 2020 wang et al 2020 in this study compared with pef wpf had more favorable soil hydrothermal conditions throughout the growing seasons in the three crops due to the densely distributed tiny holes in the film and successfully preserved of ineffective precipitation consequently soil enzyme urease alkaline phosphatase and catalase activities were consistently higher under wpf than under pef figs 6 7 and 8 on the other hand soil nutrient cycling and nutrient uptake by crops from the soil are closely associated with soil enzyme activities for instance soil nitrogen and phosphorus transformation and their availability to crops can be improved by the enhanced activities of urease and alkaline phosphatase adetunji et al 2017 wang et al 2018 2020 thus the soil no3 n and available phosphorus contents under wpf were also higher than those under pef in millet with a shorter growth period there was little difference in the soil hydrothermal conditions between pef and bf thus the soil enzyme activities soil no3 n and available phosphorus contents between them were also not different in sorghum and corn with longer growth periods however the soil enzyme activities soil no3 n and available phosphorus contents under bf were decreased at flowering compared to those under pef due to the worse hydrothermal conditions caused by the untimely degradation of the bf therefore bf is not a suitable alternative to pef in crops with longer growth periods 5 conclusions the present study shows that ineffective precipitation was successfully preserved by wpf and was used by crops thus the yield and wp under wpf were 5 18 and 18 22 higher respectively than those under pef in all crops soil water storage was 13 19 mm higher throughout the growing season and the soil temperature at 5 10 cm depth under wpf was lower than that under pef during the daytime when the soil temperature reached 25 30 consequently wpf had higher activities of urease alkaline phosphatase catalase and soil no3 n and available phosphorus contents therefore wpf could be a competitive alternative to pef in areas with highly distributed ineffective precipitation the yield and wp of bf did not decrease in millet while they were 8 15 lower in sorghum and corn than in pef for millet the degradation of bf had less effect on the soil hydrothermal conditions than that of pef had for sorghum and millet the bf degraded too early during the period from jointing to flowering wherein the lais of sorghum and corn were small and the rainy season did not come consequently soil water storage soil temperature soil enzyme activities and soil no3 n and available phosphorus contents were simultaneously decreased under bf compared to those under pef in sorghum and corn therefore bf could only be an alternative to pef in crops with short growth periods or high lai declaration of

9255,polyethylene film pef cannot retain ineffective precipitation 10 mm in drylands and pef residues in farmland have detrimental impacts on soil health thus water permeable plastic film wpf that can retain ineffective precipitation and biodegradable film bf that can be degraded were developed however the yield performance using wpf and bf varied a lot in different crops and experimental sites as compared with pef here we evaluated the applicability of wpf and bf as alternatives to pef on millet sorghum and corn with different growth periods on the northern loess plateau of china our results showed that compared with pef ineffective precipitation was successfully preserved and soil water storage was 13 19 mm higher under wpf furthermore the activities of urease alkaline phosphatase catalase and contents of soil no3 n available phosphorus were also higher under wpf due to the improved soil water conditions and mitigated soil temperature consequently the yields of the three crops were 5 18 higher under wpf the yield under bf did not decrease in millet while it was 8 15 lower in sorghum and corn than that under pef when a large area of bf cracks appeared sorghum and corn were in the middle growth period with a low leaf area index lai and the rainy season did not come yet but for millet it coincided with the rainy season in its late growth period with a high lai therefore compared with pef soil water storage was 9 30 mm lower under bf in sorghum and corn during the middle growth stage which resulted in lower soil enzyme activities and nutrient contents in conclusion as an alternative to pef wpf application is favorable in areas with high ineffective precipitation and bf application is not suitable for crops with long growth period and low lai keywords soil water

decrease soil evaporation and improve soil hydrothermal conditions greatly mo et al 2016 ruiz et al 2020 it was reported that the wp and yield of staple and cash crops can be improved by 20 30 and 20

and flury 2017 le moine and ferry 2019 as the largest user of pef in the world the consumption of pef has increased to 14 7 105 tons per year and its cover area has reached 184 105 ha in china

significantly improve crop yield and wp especially in rainfed agriculture without a water source for irrigation in dryland for example on the loess plateau a typical dryland of china pef mulching combined with the improvement of agronomic practices can more than double the crop yield cui et al 2018 precipitation is the only water source in rainfed agriculture thus it is crucial to store more precipitation in farmland through pef mulching in dryland li et al 2016 mo et al 2016 under pef mulching precipitation cannot penetrate directly through the pef it generally slips from the side of the film and then infiltrates the soil when the amount of precipitation is small the precipitation is easily retained on the film surface and eventually evaporates thus ineffective precipitation precipitation below 10 mm or even a low amount of effective precipitation is difficult to be preserved in soil by pef mulching however in some drylands the frequency of ineffective precipitation events could account for 70 of annual precipitation events accordingly the total amount of ineffective precipitation each year could reach 100 mm which accounts for a large proportion of annual precipitation especially for areas with only 300 400 mm of annual precipitation yao et al 1998 thus how to use this precipitation effectively can significantly impact the further improvement of wp and the productivity of dryland crops to improve the use efficiency of ineffective precipitation and further increase crop yield in drylands a water permeable plastic film wpf was developed on the surface of the wpf there are densely distributed holes with tiny diameters once precipitation falls on the film the holes open by gravity pressure and precipitation passes through the wpf after permeation the holes close again to reduce evaporation yao 2000 theoretically compared with pef mulching wpf mulching can further increase crop yield by providing more water for crops through the utilization of ineffective precipitation however in the drylands of china wpf was not widely applied in farmland since the crop yields under wpf mulching did not consistently increase as greatly as expected as compared with pef mulching fan et al 2006 guo et al 2007 xia et al 2016 yan et al 2020 previous studies speculated that the inconsistent effects of wpf on crop yield may be fundamentally determined by the amount of ineffective precipitation that occurs during different growth stages in various crop species shan et al 2017 yan et al 2020 therefore it is necessary to assess the applicability of wpf as an alternative to pef in different crops in dryland farmland in addition to the ineffectual use of ineffective precipitation pef also has a shortcoming that cannot be ignored it is difficult or impossible to degrade thus large amounts of pef residues are burned or left in the soil by farmers because they are not willing to spend the time and money to recycle it which could result in detrimental effects on the environment scarascia mugnozza et al 2004 briassoulis 2006 due to the failure of recovery the residual amount of pef can reach 60 349 kg ha 1 in farmland dong et al 2013 film residues can disrupt soil structure entangle crop roots reduce soil permeability and suppress the movement of heat water and nutrients in the soil as well as inhibit the activities of soil microorganisms jiang et al 2017 li et al 2020 qi et al 2020 it has been shown that the film residues resulted in a 5 5 23 decrease in staple crop yield and a 14 6 59 2 decrease in cash crop yield liu et al 2008 dong et al 2013 the negative effects of pef application led to the gradual evolution of the white revolution into white pollution to alleviate the negative effects of white pollution researchers have tried to develop emerging biodegradable films bfs which consist mostly of polysaccharides and can be easily degraded in situ by soil microorganisms kijchavengkul et al 2008 moreno and moreno 2008 sintim and flury 2017 wang et al 2019 in recent years people have attempted to apply bf in various staple and cash crops around the world the effects of bf mulching on crop yield showed quite different results when compared with pef mulching some studies showed that bf could be a promising alternative to pef while other studies suggested that the application of bf poses a great risk of yield loss compared to pef mulching anzalone et al 2010 ghimire et al 2018 yan et al 2020 one explanation could be that the timing of bf degradation is difficult to control if the bf degrades too early then the area of bare soil will be enlarged and the soil evaporation will be increased in other words bf mulching can decrease soil evaporation and improve soil hydrothermal conditions during the early growth stage however these effects will disappear at the late growth stage due to the degradation of the bf therefore some studies suggested that bf may be a suitable candidate in crops with short growth periods yan et al 2016 2020 thus as a highly anticipated alternative to pef it is imperative to verify the applicability of bf to crops with different growth periods and understand what causes the discrepant applicability of bf among different crops the loess plateau is a typical dryland of china in this area the amount of annual precipitation ranges from 250 to 650 mm and annual evapotranspiration could reach 1300 1800 mm furthermore no irrigation is available because groundwater resources are very sparse and deep yang et al 2021 thus pef mulching accounts for 40 of the total arable lands on the loess plateau koskei et al 2021 consequently the amount of pef residues in soil is as high as 75 300 kg ha 1 which endangers food security and soil health dong et al 2013 liu et al 2014 zhao et al 2021 thus it is very important to develop bf to replace pef for the sustainable development of agriculture and environmental protection in addition on the loess plateau the amount of ineffective precipitation can reach 100 mm which accounts for 15 40 of the annual precipitation each year yao et al 1998 further increasing the utilization of these ineffective precipitation may be an important way to further improve crop yield chinese agronomists have made many attempts to develop the application of wpf and bf on crops however replacing pef with wpf or bf is still controversial different crops have different growth periods growth characteristics and planting times and their requirements for hydrothermal conditions are quite different therefore instead of pef mulching wpf and bf mulching could be applied on some crops in certain areas in this study we investigated the effects of pef wpf and bf on yield of three crops millet sorghum and corn with different growth periods and growth characteristics in yuling county shannxi province located in the northern loess plateau meanwhile the differences in soil hydrothermal and nutrient conditions among different mulching treatments were also studied in doing so we aimed to 1 evaluate the applicability of wpf and bf as alternatives to pef on different crops in this area and 2 clarify what causes the discrepant applicability of wpf and bf among different crops we believe that our results will provide useful information to the partial substitution of pef by wpf and bf 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the field experiment was initiated in april 2019 and lasted until october 2020 at xiejiagou agro ecological experimental station 110 11 e 38 31 n 1180 m elevation which is situated in a typical

precipitation is 404 mm and the groundwater level is 50 m below the soil surface the soil texture of the experimental plots was sandy loam before sowing in 2019 we randomly collected soil samples from twelve spots in the experimental field to determine the basic soil chemical and physical properties in the 0 20 cm soil layers which are presented in table 1 the bulk density was 1 35 g cm 3 soil

483 and 437 mm in 2019 wet year and 2020 normal year respectively fig s1 2 2 experimental design and field management the experiment was conducted following a randomized complete block design with four treatments i e mulching with polyethylene film pef mulching with water permeable plastic film wpf mulching with biodegradable film bf and no mulching nm the three films were 0 008 mm thick 80 cm wide and white shanxi academy of agricultural sciences taigu china and the films were tailored and applied to farmland based on the row spacing of different crops water permeable plastic film was made from polyethylene and water permeable additives with 5 10 µm pore size and 12 mm cm2 h 23 101 3 kpa penetration rate the biodegradable film was made of starch polymer with an induction period of 60 80 d each treatment was replicated thrice as plots and each plot was 6 10 m millet sorghum and corn were planted in rows without mulching or under strip film in each experimental year the planting densities of millet sorghum and corn were 400 000 100 000 and 62 400 plants ha 1 with 50 50 and 60 cm row spacing respectively the specific growth periods day and the precipitation during those periods of the three crops are shown in table 2 the cultivars of millet sorghum and corn were jingu 21 jinza 22 and dafeng 30 respectively manure at a rate of 15 000 kg hm 2 and compound fertilizer contains 20 nitrogen 15 phosphorus and 10 potassium at a rate of 600 kg hm 2 were applied before plowing each year the manure consisted of sheep dung containing 246 g kg 1 organic matter 20 5 g kg 1 total nitrogen 20 1 g kg 1 total phosphorus 1 99 mg kg 1 no3 n and 1 02 mg kg 1 nh4 n 2 3 measurements and methods 2 3 1 soil water storage actual crop evapotranspiration and wp the soil water storage in the 0 200 cm soil depth at the sowing jointing flowering and harvest stages was measured and calculated according to the following equations burgess et al 2014 1 sws swc bd sd where sws is the soil water storage mm swc is the soil water content w w which was measured by the oven drying method gardner 1986 and bd and sd are the soil bulk density g cm 3 and soil depth cm respectively the actual crop evapotranspiration eta of the three crops during different growth stages was calculated as follows hati et al 2006 pereira et al 2021 2 eta p sws r d where p sws r and d are precipitation the change in sws at the 0 200 cm soil depth surface runoff and deep leakage respectively during a period in eq 2 surface runoff and deep leakage can be neglected because they rarely occur in this area the wp was calculated as follows hati et al 2006 fernández et al 2020 3 wp grain yield eta 2 3 2 soil temperature in each plot the soil temperature at 5 10 and 20 cm soil depths was automatically recorded every half hour using an automatic soil temperature recorder beijing boyuanhuida technology co ltd beijing china during the whole growing season of the three crops we did not test the soil temperature below a 20 cm depth because there were almost no differences in soil temperature among the different mulching films when the depth reached 20 cm gu et al 2018 2 3 3 soil no3 n and available phosphorus contents fresh soil samples were collected twice from a 20 cm soil depth in each plot at the jointing flowering and harvest stages kcl solution 1 mol l 1 was used to extract soil samples by shaking them for 1 h and the extracted solution was filtered through filter paper keeney and bruner 1966 the soil no3 n content was determined in an aa3 automatic continuous flow analyzer skalar breda the netherlands the available phosphorus was extracted by 0 5 mol l 1 nahco3 olsen et al 1954 and then analyzed by a high resolution digital colorimeter autoanalyzer skalar breda the netherlands 2 3 4 soil enzyme activities soil urease alkaline phosphatase and catalase play important roles in soil nitrogen and phosphorus transformation and their availability to crops adetunji et al 2017 wang et al 2018 2020 therefore the three enzymes were selected in this study to evaluate the effect of different mulching treatments on soil fertility at the jointing flowering and harvest stages fresh soil samples were collected from a 20 cm soil depth for soil enzyme activity determination the soil urease activity mg nh4 n 100 g 1 soil 24 hr 1 was measured by indophenol blue method ge et al 2009 the alkaline phosphatase activity mg phenol g 1 soil 2 h 1 was determined by phenyl phosphate disodium colorimetric method boldt burisch and naeth 2017 the catalase activity 0 1 mol l 1 kmno4 g 1 h 1 was measured by back titration method with kmno4 and h2o2 solutions stpniewska et al 2009 2 3 5 aboveground dry matter leaf area index lai and crop yields at the jointing and flowering stages the aboveground plants from two rows 1 m length per row in each millet plot and the aboveground parts of five plants from different rows in each sorghum and corn plot were collected and weighed after oven drying at 80 c for 48 h lai was measured using a lai 2200 canopy analyzer li cor lincoln ne usa from 12 spots in each plot at harvest three times the number of samples than the samples in the above growth stages were collected from each plot and weighed after air drying and seed yield of three crops was also measured 2 4 statistical analyses all data were analyzed using spss 20 0 software ibm company chicago il usa to determine the significant difference among the different treatments during the same growth stage in each year duncan s test p 0 05 was used to compare the means of the four treatments 3 results 3 1 soil water storage and crop evapotranspiration the soil water storage under different treatments is shown in fig 1 in millet compared with nm soil water storage was increased significantly under pef wpf and bf at the tested growth stage compared with that of pef soil water storage was 6 8 13 19 mm higher under wpf and was not lower under bf at both the jointing and flowering stages in sorghum and corn under the bf treatment soil water storage was only increased at the jointing stage compared with nm in addition compared with pef soil water storage under wpf was 5 8 15 23 mm higher at the jointing stage and 3 6 13 18 mm higher at the flowering stage in sorghum and corn in contrast soil water storage was significantly lower under bf than under pef at the flowering stage actual crop evapotranspiration during different growth stages was profoundly affected by different treatments fig 2 from the sowing to the jointing stage eta was greatly decreased by 10 28 8 26 mm 24 42 19 44 mm and 11 24 9 23 mm under pef wpf and bf respectively compared with that under nm compared with the eta of pef the eta of wpf was lower in each year from the jointing to the flowering stage the eta of bf was increased in corn in 2019 and in sorghum in 2020 compared with nm when compared with pef eta was unchanged under wpf but was higher under bf in sorghum and corn in two years from the flowering to the harvest stage eta was increased under pef wpf and bf compared with that of nm and there were no differences in eta among the three mulching treatments 3 2 soil temperature the daily change and the hourly change in soil temperature at soil depths of 5 10 and 20 cm are shown in figs 3 4 and 5 and figs s2 s3 and s4 respectively at the 5 and 10 cm soil depths figs 3 and 4 from the sowing to jointing stages the average soil temperature was 1 04 1 95 0 53 1 46 and 0 91 1 86 higher respectively under pef wpf and bf than under nm compared with pef the average soil temperature was 0 36 0 63 lower under wpf from the jointing to flowering stages the average soil temperature was lower under wpf and bf than under pef from the flowering to the harvest stage the average soil temperature was decreased by 0 21 0 65 under pef and wpf compared with that of nm and it was similar between nm and bf at the 20 cm soil depth fig 5 from the sowing to jointing stage the average soil temperature was increased by 0 45 0 75 0 23 0 49 and 0 41 0 67 under pef wpf and bf respectively compared with that under nm from the jointing to the harvest stages there were fewer differences in the average soil temperature among the three mulching treatments figs s2 s3 and s4 show that the rank order of soil temperature in the daytime under the four treatments was pef bf wpf nm from the sowing to the jointing stage pef wpf bf nm from the jointing to the flowering stage and nm bf pef wpf from the flowering to the harvest stage and these differences gradually decreased with increasing soil depth 3 3 soil no3 n available phosphorus and enzyme activities as shown in figs 6 7 and 8 the soil no3 n content available phosphorus content and enzyme activities were profoundly affected by different treatments at the jointing stage compared with nm the soil no3 n content available phosphorus content and enzyme activities were increased greatly under the three mulching treatments and they were the highest under wpf at the flowering stage in sorghum and corn the soil no3 n content available phosphorus content and enzyme activities did not increase under bf compared with those under nm and they were also the highest under wpf at the harvest stage there were small differences in soil no3 n content and available phosphorus content among the four treatments and in enzyme activities between nm and bf in addition soil enzyme activities were higher under pef and wpf than they were under nm and bf 3 4 aboveground dry mass and leaf area index lai the dynamic changes in aboveground dry mass among different treatments are shown in fig 9 in millet compared with pef the aboveground dry mass under wpf was consistently higher but showed no change under bf in sorghum and corn the aboveground dry mass was also the highest under wpf among the four treatments in addition compared with that of pef the aboveground dry mass was lower under bf at the flowering and harvest stages lai varied largely among different crops or treatments the average lais of the four treatments in millet were 3 13 and 4 91 those in sorghum were 1 91 and 2 80 and those in corn were 2 15 and 3 32 at the jointing and flowering stages respectively compared with that of pef lai was consistently higher under wpf the lai was not different between pef and bf at the jointing stage at the flowering stage there was also no difference in lai between pef and bf in millet however in sorghum and corn the lai was lower under bf than under pef 3 5 crop yield and water productivity wp table 3 shows that the yield increased under the three mulching treatments compared with that under nm the yields were increased by 20 38 34 63 and 20 36 in millet by 19 42 33 62 and 9 20 in sorghum and by 14 24 20 40 and 4 9 in corn under pef wpf and bf respectively compared with those under nm compared with pef the yield of wpf was much higher the yield was not different in millet between pef and bf while it was decreased greatly in sorghum and corn under bf wp showed the highest under wpf and the lowest under nm nm bf pef wpf in addition harvest indexes were higher under pef wpf and bf than those under nm the soil water storage at harvest was also the highest under wpf and the lowest under nm wpf pef bf nm in contrast the eta of the four treatments showed an inverse order which was nm bf pef wpf 4 discussion our two year study showed that compared with the yield of nm the yields of the three mulching treatments were all increased greatly in the three crops table 3 importantly compared with that of pef the yields of the three crops were consistently higher under wpf while although the yield of bf did not decrease in millet it was significantly lower in sorghum and corn therefore wpf could be a competitive alternative to pef while bf could only be a promising alternative to pef in crops with short growth periods such as millet on the northern loess plateau crop yield is profoundly affected by soil water status especially in drylands yang et al 2021 in the two experimental years the amount of ineffective precipitation ranged from 89 to 112 mm during the growing seasons and the proportion of ineffective precipitation from the sowing to jointing jointing to flowering and flowering to harvest stages was 30 36 25 30 mm 15 23 33 53 mm and 15 38 22 30 mm respectively table 2 a large amount of ineffective precipitation was generally lost through evaporation however compared with the soil water storage of pef the soil water storage of wpf was higher at nearly all tested growth stages in the three crops fig 1 indicating that ineffective precipitation was successfully preserved by wpf some studies indicated that crop yield under wpf mulching did not consistently increase as much as expected when compared with the yield under pef mulching fan et al 2006 guo et al 2007 xia et al 2016 yan et al 2020 we speculate that this may be related to the total amount of ineffective precipitation and its distribution characteristics during the growing season the successfully preserved ineffective precipitation also influenced eta under wpf it is well known that during the early growth stage when lai is low and the area of bare soil is large eta could be decreased if the loss of precipitation through evaporation was greatly inhibited chen et al 2010 eberbach and pala 2005 in this study before the jointing stage the amount of ineffective precipitation was 25 30 mm table 2 and the eta of wpf was decreased significantly by 11 23 mm compared with that of pef fig 2 which suggests that the loss of ineffective precipitation through evaporation was greatly reduced under wpf from the jointing to the harvest stage there were 61 83 mm of ineffective precipitation thus logically speaking the eta of wpf should be lower than that of pef however our results show that the eta during this period was not different between that of pef and wpf during the late growth stage large amounts of soil water will be consumed through crop transpiration with increased aboveground dry matter unkovich et al 2018 peng et al 2020 accordingly the amount of crop transpiration accounts for a large proportion of eta during this period and is mainly affected by the plant population jia et al 2018 after the jointing stage aboveground dry matter was consistently higher under wpf than that under pef therefore during the late growth stage a large part of the extra stored ineffective precipitation under wpf may be used for crop transpiration which made the difference in eta disappear between pef and wpf in this study compared with pef the average soil temperature was lower under wpf from the sowing to the flowering stage especially at the 5 cm soil depth figs 3 4 and 5 the hourly variation in soil temperature further shows that the soil temperature was lower from approximately 10 00 a m to 16 00 p m lst when the soil temperature reached 25 30 figs s2 s3 and s4 yao 2000 reported that the densely distributed holes of wpf would open under the effect of high vapor pressure below the film surface when the soil temperature is high and that this characteristic enables wpf to alleviate the damaging effect of high temperature to crop growth the degradation of bf has a great effect on crop yield by influencing soil hydrothermal conditions koskei et al 2021 zhao et al 2021 in this study the degradation of the bf initiated at 60 70 days after sowing das and a large area of cracks appeared at approximately 80 90 das the growth period from the sowing to jointing stage was 54 68 das in the three crops thus soil temperature soil water storage and eta were not different significantly between pef and bf during this period from the jointing to flowering stage the growth periods of millet sorghum and corn were 54 jointing 88 flowering 61 108 and 60 111 das respectively table 3 during the period when a large area of cracks appeared millet was almost in the flowering stage with an lai value of approximately 5 and had entered the rainy season while sorghum and corn had not entered the rainy season and were still in the middle stage between the jointing and flowering stages with an lai value of only 2 5 figs s1 and 10 the large area of cracks in the bf can result in the loss of soil water through evaporation from bare soil especially in the middle stages if there were fewer precipitation events and the crop canopy was not large enough to cover the bare soil eberbach and pala 2005 gu et al 2017 aldien et al 2018 therefore compared with that of pef the soil water storage under bf at the flowering stage did not decrease in millet but was much lower in sorghum and corn fig 1 furthermore from the jointing to the flowering stage eta also did not differ between pef and bf in millet while in sorghum and corn eta was higher under bf than under pef indicating that more soil water was lost through evaporation it should be noted here that if the lai of a crop is large enough to cover nearly all bare soil during the early growth stage then the degradation of the bf may not lead to significant increase in soil evaporation and worse soil water hydrothermal conditions at later stages previous studies have indicated that soil enzyme activities can be greatly increased under greater soil water storage and soil temperature by regulating the substrate availability for nutrient turnover related enzymes lópez et al 2014 pérez guzmán et al 2020 wang et al 2020 in this study compared with pef wpf had more favorable soil hydrothermal conditions throughout the growing seasons in the three crops due to the densely distributed tiny holes in the film and successfully preserved of ineffective precipitation consequently soil enzyme urease alkaline phosphatase and catalase activities were consistently higher under wpf than under pef figs 6 7 and 8 on the other hand soil nutrient cycling and nutrient uptake by crops from the soil are closely associated with soil enzyme activities for instance soil nitrogen and phosphorus transformation and their availability to crops can be improved by the enhanced activities of urease and alkaline phosphatase adetunji et al 2017 wang et al 2018 2020 thus the soil no3 n and available phosphorus contents under wpf were also higher than those under pef in millet with a shorter growth period there was little difference in the soil hydrothermal conditions between pef and bf thus the soil enzyme activities soil no3 n and available phosphorus contents between them were also not different in sorghum and corn with longer growth periods however the soil enzyme activities soil no3 n and available phosphorus contents under bf were decreased at flowering compared to those under pef due to the worse hydrothermal conditions caused by the untimely degradation of the bf therefore bf is not a suitable alternative to pef in crops with longer growth periods 5 conclusions the present study shows that ineffective precipitation was successfully preserved by wpf and was used by crops thus the yield and wp under wpf were 5 18 and 18 22 higher respectively than those under pef in all crops soil water storage was 13 19 mm higher throughout the growing season and the soil temperature at 5 10 cm depth under wpf was lower than that under pef during the daytime when the soil temperature reached 25 30 consequently wpf had higher activities of urease alkaline phosphatase catalase and soil no3 n and available phosphorus contents therefore wpf could be a competitive alternative to pef in areas with highly distributed ineffective precipitation the yield and wp of bf did not decrease in millet while they were 8 15 lower in sorghum and corn than in pef for millet the degradation of bf had less effect on the soil hydrothermal conditions than that of pef had for sorghum and millet the bf degraded too early during the period from jointing to flowering wherein the lais of sorghum and corn were small and the rainy season did not come consequently soil water storage soil temperature soil enzyme activities and soil no3 n and available phosphorus contents were simultaneously decreased under bf compared to those under pef in sorghum and corn therefore bf could only be an alternative to pef in crops with short growth periods or high lai declaration of

less than 1000 mg l of row produced water was utilized to irrigate greenhouse tomatoes martel valles et al 2014 the feasibility of utilizing produced water in crop irrigation is related to its ion and organics to that end desalination of produced water to acceptable levels of various plants could be a viable solution hpoc llc is one of the oil and gas companies that produces substantial amounts of produced water during oil explorations the company provided produced water source water of a salinity of about 8600 mg l in the state of new mexico produced water salinity is highly variable and can range from 8000 mg l to 250 000 mg l in the present study we created a salinity gradient of irrigation waters from 230 mg l to 8600 mg l to irrigate five forages species the objectives of this study were to i investigate the effects of produced water on seed germination and plants growth parameters and ii monitor the changes in the soil properties due to irrigation with produced water 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design and treatments two harvests from 22 may 2021 15 december 2021 were conducted in the fabian garcia science center greenhouse in las cruces nm usa 32 2805 n and 106 770 w elevation 1186 m an extended third harvest continued from december 15 2021 to february 27 2022 to confirm the viability of the experiment for each experimental harvest the experimental unit was a pot 15 cm deep and 15 cm in diameter packed with air dried and sieved through a 2 mm sieve loamy soil 52 56 sand 22 72 silt 24 72 clay with a bulk density of 1 43 g cm3 three produced water

source water and 427 mg l tap or city water table 1 were arranged in a completely randomized design with four replicates the raw produced water or source water was provided by hpoc and was first run through a carbon filter then desalinated using ro at the brackish groundwater national desalination research facility bgndrf alamogordo new mexico all treatment waters are shown in table 1 which also provides ph sodium adsorption ratio sar total dissolved solids tds and concentrations of some ions 2 2 plant selection western wheatgrass pascopyrum smithii alfalfa medicago sativa meadow bromegrass bromus biebersteinii russian wildrye psathyrostachys junceus and tall fescue schedonorus arundinaceus seeds were selected for the study because they are broadly adapted to grow in the colder climates of northern new mexico in a completely randomized design these five forage species were arranged in four replicates and irrigated with four water treatments in 80 pots 5 4 4 80 in each harvest randomization was achieved by generating random numbers using microsoft excel 2013 prior to sowing seeds were subjected to water test to check for seed viability twenty five seeds per pot of each species were planted in the top 2 cm of the soil the pots with the seedlings were irrigated with the four treatments from the beginning of the experiment depending on soil moisture content plants were irrigated five to six times every month germination percentage was calculated 30 days after seeding plants were harvested on september 22 2021 for the first harvest december 15 2021 for the second harvest and february 27 2021 for the extended third harvest 2 3 evapotranspiration evapotranspiration et was determined using a water balance equation shukla 2014 1 et ir r s ro dp where ir is the depth of irrigation cm r is rainfall cm r 0 s is the change in soil water storage between irrigations cm assumed 0 ro is runoff cm ro 0 and dp is the deep percolation cm leachate collected from the bottom of pots irrigations were made at a management allowed depletion of about 50 2 4 plant measurements each month plant heights from the base of the stem to the tip of the shoot chlorophyll content and leaf temperature were measured during the two harvests of the experiment using a tape measure spad meter and ir thermometer respectively the exact number of plants were allowed to grow for three months with no thinning during each harvest at the end of each harvest shoots were harvested and fresh weights were recorded the shoots were dried in the oven at 65 c for 48 h and dry weights were recorded for biomass calculation dried shoots were ground and packed in small storage bags and sent to ag source laboratory lincoln nebraska for chemical analysis along with irrigation water and leachate samples 2 5 soil bulk density and chemical analysis core samples were collected from each of the pots under irrigation salinity treatments at the end of the experiment soil bulk density was determined using cores blake and hartge 1986 loose soil samples were collected from the pots air dried mixed and sieved through a 2 mm sieve prior to shipping them to the ag source laboratories lincoln nebraska for chemical analysis sodium adsorption ratio sar was calculated based on robbins 1983 using the following equation 2 sar na 1 ca 2 mg 2 2 where na is sodium ion concentration meq l ca is calcium ion concentration meq l and mg is magnesium ion concentration meq l 2 6 statistical analysis the experimental design was a completely randomized design with four replications all statistical analyses were performed using sas software v 9 4 differences due to treatments on plant germination and growth were determined using one way analysis of variance anova and means were separated using the least significant difference lsd an alpha level of 0 05 was used to determine statistical significance 3 results 3 1 greenhouse meteorology greenhouse temperatures ranged from 15 1 to 46 9 c prior to first harvest 13 4 33 5 c before the second harvest and 13 7 28 4 c prior to the third harvest fig 1 relative humidity in the greenhouse ranged from 10 to 88 12 80 and 16 4 50 2 for the three harvests respectively fig 1 daily light integral dli is important for plant growth development yield and quality dli was 16 21 19 82 and 18 63 mol m2 day for the three harvests respectively fig 1 at day 104 of the experiment period greenhouse shade was removed which explained the increase in dli at that time 3 2 seed germination table 2 shows the germination percentage of the five forage species only bromegrass and tall fescue germinated in raw water table 2 bromegrass had an 86 germination in ro water but 100 in raw water however plants did not survive beyond the first month of

differences were recorded in the second measurement in august for alfalfa heights and spad value table 3 for bromegrass the lowest recorded height in july was in raw irrigated water while the spad

russian wildrye height was similar in ro tap and diluted raw water while the spad value was higher in diluted raw water than ro and tap water table 3 this trend shifted in august when height was greater in the diluted raw irrigation with no differences observed in the spad value table 3 greater tall fescue height was recorded in tap water while the lowest height was recorded in raw water whereas the spad value was greater in the raw water in july table 3 a similar trend was observed in august table 3 diluted raw irrigation increased spad value of wheatgrass and russian wildrye while decreased the spad value of bromegrass decreases in tall fescue heights as the irrigation water salinity increases in the second harvest first and second measurements in october and november wheatgrass height and spad value were greater numerically in diluted raw than ro and tap water table 4 no differences were observed with regard to alfalfa height in october and november table 4 and the spad value was the lowest in diluted raw irrigation and of with tap irrigation in october and november respectively table 4 the observations illustrated no differences among the treatments with regard to bromegrass height and spad value for both measurement time table 4 russian wildrye was the tallest and spad value was the highest in diluted raw water in october table 4 however in november no differences between the grass heights were observed although spad value remained higher in diluted raw irrigation than ro and tap table 4 tall fescue grass showed only numerical differences with regard to height and spad value with the raw treatment in october table 4 in november however the height of 19 cm and spad value of 22 15 were recorded with raw water table 4 wheatgrass russian wildrye and tall fescue height and spad value increased with increasing water salinity while alfalfa height and spad value decreased with increases in water salinity 3 6 leachate ions concentrate collected leachate water samples from all the five forage species showed increases in na mg ca and cl ion concentration in produced water compared with the tap water for the two measurement times during the first harvest table 5 large increases in na ions followed by cl from resulted leachate from the pots irrigated with raw and diluted raw water leachate water of the diluted raw and raw irrigation was considered sodic sar 13 and saline ec 2800 mg l for the two times measurements for the first harvest table 5 s1 similarly in the second harvest the ion concentrations were higher in the leachate water samples with increasing salt concentration of the irrigation treatment table 6 s2 similar to the first harvest leachate water in the second harvest was considered saline and sodic in raw and diluted raw irrigation table 6 s2 increases in irrigation water salinity increased the leachate water na mg ca and cl ions concentration and sar 3 7 plants ion contents the plant tissue samples at the end of the first harvest showed non significant differences with regard to total n with increasing irrigation water salinity table 7 alfalfa did not show a significant difference in phosphorus content with increasing treatment salinity table 7 nonsignificant differences were observed in bromegrass samples with regard to p k ca mn fe and s content with increasing irrigation water salinity tables 7 8 increasing irrigation water salinity did not significantly affect the content of p mg fe and al in russian wildrye tables 7 8 increases in irrigation water salinity had no significant effect on the mg ca and zn concentration in tall fescue table 7 increases in irrigation water salinity diluted raw significantly decreased the concentration of p k mg ca zn fe and al in wheatgrass tissue while mn s and na increased in wheatgrass tissue tables 7 8 with the increases in water salinity diluted raw k and ca in alfalfa decreased table 7 while mg mn s and na increased tables 7 8 increases in mg s zn and na content in bromegrass can be observed with increases in water salinity diluted raw whereas b decreased tables 7 8 russian wildrye showed significant increases in mg mn s and na ion concentrations with increases in irrigation water salinity from ro to diluted raw tables 7 8 while k ca zn and b decreased tables 7 8 tall fescue s fe b al s and na ion concentrations increased with increases in water salinity raw table 8 however p k mn and b decreased tables 7 8 tables 9 and 10 show the plants ion concentrations in the second harvest the second harvest continued to show similar trends as the first harvest with regard to the ion concentration of forage species salts accumulation in plant tissues can be observed with increases in salt uptake when comparing the results of the two harvests however species survived both harvests and also grew back again after the second harvest with continued irrigation with the same treatments 3 8 soil bulk density organic matter ph and electrical conductivity ec soil bulk density at the end of the experiment is presented in table 11 within species the results indicated a slight increase in soil bulk density with continued irrigation with diluted raw however this increase was not statistically significant table 11 a significant increase in soil bulk density can be observed in raw irrigated pots followed by diluted raw within tall fescue illustrating that increases in irrigation water salinity increased soil bulk density table 11 pots irrigated with ro and diluted raw showed significant decline in soil om compared with the control for wheatgrass alfalfa bromegrass and russian wildrye species table 11 for tall fescue species the decline in soil om continued in ro and diluted water however the lowest soil om was recorded in raw water irrigated soil table 11 the soil ph trend was near neutral in ro water however alkalinity increased as water salinity increased table 11 soil ec increased in diluted raw for wheatgrass alfalfa bromegrass and russian wildrye pots the highest ec recorded was in raw water in tall fescue followed by diluted raw table 11 3 9 soil ions concentrations for wheatgrass soil p fe and b decreased with increases in salinity while k s mg ca na significantly increased tables 12 13 in alfalfa pots irrigated with diluted raw soil n fe and b significantly decreased while k s na increased in pots irrigated with diluted raw tables 12 13 reduction in soil k mg ca and b ion concentrations resulted in diluted raw whereas s na increased in bromegrass pots irrigated with diluted raw tables 12 13 russian wildrye pots showed increases in soil s and na with increasing water salinity while k mg and b decreased tables 12 13 increases were seen in soil p s na mn and fe ion concentrations in tall fescue pots irrigated with raw water however mg ca and b decreased table 13 soil sar significantly increased in diluted raw water pots of wheatgrass alfalfa and bromegrass and was considered saline soil but not sodic table 13 in tall fescue pots soil in raw water was considered saline and sodic table 13 4 discussion 4 1 seed germination forage species germination results showed differences in their response to the four irrigation treatments this could be due to their level of tolerance to various levels of saline water flores et al 2015 with regard to germination rate reported similarities between six halophytic species x triticosecale atriplex canescens hordeum vulgare lepidium alyssoides distichlis stricta and panicum virgatum irrigated with saline water up to 7000 mg l as results showed russian wildrye germination percentage was the lowest among the species utilized in this study and that might be due to the seeds vitality since it was for all three treatments as the level of salinity increased alfalfa wheatgrass bromegrass and russian wildrye germination percentages decreased and never germinated under raw water 8610 mg l and this emphasized that these species are more sensitive to increases in water salinity among the five species tall fescue species germinated well with raw water which shows suitability of this species for irrigation with raw water 4 2 plant dry biomass within species alfalfa biomass decreased with diluted raw however compared with other species alfalfa produced higher dry biomass in ro tap and diluted raw water this could be due to the rapid growth of alfalfa aboveground biomass compared with the other grass species this agrees with a previous study comparing the growth of alfalfa and triticale irrigated with various levels of saline water up to 5600 mg l where alfalfa growth decreased with increasing irrigation water salinity kankarla et al 2019 barley hordeum vulgare grew well with high biomass as the irrigation treatment salinity increased katerji et al 2009 in contrast with increasing water salinity khan and glenn 1996 reported reduction in barley biomass tall fescue grew well in raw up to 8610 mg l therefore it can be considered a halophyte kankarla et al 2019 and ozturk et al 2018 reported no reduction in triticale biomass irrigated with 5600 and 7000 mg l saline water respectively which agrees with our finding for tall fescue species 4 3 evapotranspiration continuous irrigation with saline water caused decreases in cumulative et for all five species and resulted in decreased plant growth and biomass yang et al 2020 reported related results when et of tomato decreased with increasing irrigation water salinity ranged between 1400 and 4200 mg l on accord with this study decreases in pecan et with increasing irrigation water salinity up to 5600 mg l have been reported ben ali et al 2021 however no changes in plant biomass and et were reported when irrigation up to 7000 mg l was applied to halophytic species ozturk et al 2018 4 4 plant height and spad value the results indicated no significant changes in the forage species with continued irrigation with diluted raw and tall fescue with raw water irrigation on the contrary pessarakli 2011 reported decreases in salt grass species distichlis spicata l shoot length with increasing water salinity spad value was higher in tap and diluted raw water irrigated plants than with ro treatment a decrease in chlorophyll content was reported on pecan leaves irrigated with water up to 5600 mg l ben ali et al 2020 tomato chlorophyll content decreased with increases in salinity taffouo et al 2010 zhang et al 2016 li et al 2018 reported decreases in chlorophyll content of eremochloa ophiuroids irrigated with nacl dominant saline water 4 5 plant ion contents three major tools to distinguish ions toxicity are plant analysis soil testing and field observations mccauley et al 2009 the irrigation water showed increases in na ca mg and cl with increasing salinity of water these ions respond in one of paths leach out of the soil accumulate in the soil or accumulate in plants tissue by root water uptake as the results indicated na ca mg and cl ions presented in the plants tissues increased as the treatment salinity increased wheatgrass alfalfa bromegrass russian wildrye and tall fescue gained and accumulate na and cl and which may have led to the decreases in the biomass by increasing water salinity these results are consistent with a previous study that applied saline water on alfalfa and triticale kankarla et al 2019 pica et al 2017 reported that produced water with a na concentration of 1156 mg l inhibited sweet wormwood and switchgrass growth tall fescue thrived and grew back after the two harvests despite the na content in raw water being 59 times greater than in the control demonstrating that tall fescue is more tolerant to high na levels than other species a previous study reported that the tolerance of tissue to accumulated na or cl osmotic stress tolerance and na or cl exclusion are the three adaptation types of plant to salinity stress munns and tester 2008 and plants differ in their response to na and cl accumulation tavakkoli et al 2010 ca performs a significant role in mitigating salt toxicity which is associated with the selective effect of k na by controlling the flow of na through non selective ion channels rahneshan et al 2018 the results showed decreases in ca in raw irrigated species meaning that tall fescue might have the potential of utilizing na for growth while higher ca might assist wheatgrass alfalfa bromegrass and russian wildrye to reduce the toxic effects of na on their growth this role might be the reason for the grasses survival since the increases in na were higher with increases in the treatment s salinity however these plants might have a mechanism that controls the increases in na and cl by sequestering these ions in the vacuoles to manage low concentrations in the cytoplasm therefore resulting in good metabolism kankarla et al 2019 nitrogen is responsible for nucleic acid chlorophyll and protein production mccauley et al 2009 magnesium has a key role on enzyme activation and is related to chlorophyll content ben ali et al 2020 in our study mg declined as the irrigation water increased which might explain the increases in chlorophyll content by increasing water salinity a previous study mentioned that increased mg decreased chlorophyll content of pecan trees irrigated with saline water up to 5600 mg l ben ali et al 2020 phosphorus reduction causes interruption in cell signaling and protein synthesis epstein and bloom 2005 our results showed decreases in p concentration in the forage tissues with increasing water salinity these results agreed with a previous study hussain et al 2014 potassium s role is to activate enzymes contributed with atp production and to regulate photosynthetic presses epstein and bloom 2005 the increases in na might eliminate plant k uptake and interrupt photosynthesis regulation hussain et al 2014 in this study k decreased in wheatgrass bromegrass and tall fescue tissues with increased na concentration the sulfur ion is important for chlorophyll and protein synthesis mccauley et al 2009 our results showed increases in s ions when water salinity increased zinc is used primarily for internode elongation and chlorophyll therefore any deficiency can affect the plants growth mccauley et al 2009 the forage species presented reduction in zn as the irrigation water salinity increased however growth was not affected iron is a principal element for plant respiration mccauley et al 2009 fe decreased with increased water salinity however the plant s growth was not clearly affected manganese is important in chloroplasts where photosynthesis takes place mccauley et al 2009 in this study mn declined with increased water salinity with all the forage species boron has a role on cell wall formation and reproductive tissue mccauley et al 2009 boron can be toxic to plants however plants are varied in acceptable concentrations that they can manage mccauley et al 2009 even with the increases in b concentration in the forages irrigated with ro and raw plant species did not show any signs of b toxicity such as chlorosis and necrosis meaning that the plants could have managed the increase in b concentration one exception was with bromegrass showing signs of b toxicity due to the increases in b concentration with ro irrigation treatment 4 6 soil bulk density organic matter ph and ec as the water salinity increased with continuous irrigation soil bulk density increased this was due to salt precipitation in the soil pores with attendant decreases in the pores size in contrast al nabulsi 2001 reported decreases in soil bulk density when irrigated with 7700 mg l sodic drainage water while ben ali et al 2021 reported no differences with continuous irrigation with saline water up to 5600 mg l our results indicated significant reduction in soil om as the salinity increased in agreement with our findings zhang et al 2019 also reported a reduction in om and increases in alkalinity with increasing salinity results indicated that as the irrigation water salinity increased soil ec significantly increased this increase however was not as large as expected and this was due to the leaching fraction which ranged between 40 and 50 of the irrigation water amount which prevented salt build up in the soil according to ayres and wescot 1985 leachate of 50 could control salt build up in the soil reflecting in reduced salt accumulation in plants in consent with this study previous greenhouse studies reported greater increases in soil ec than ours along with continued irrigation with brackish water ec 2870 7000 mg l to irrigate halophytic species flores et al 2016 ozturk et al 2018 4 7 leachate and soil ion concentrations leaching accumulation and root uptake are the three major pathways for water and soil ion transport irrigation with produced water could increase salinity and sodicity which can be observed on leachate water results collected from the pots as the water salinity concentration increased the leachate became more saline and sodic the increase in treatment salinity led to leaching of mg ca na and cl in the collected leachate samples comparable results were reported with alfalfa species irrigated with various levels of saline water kankarla et al 2019 compared to the control irrigated soil soil na concentration was five times higher in diluted raw water in wheatgrass and alfalfa pots while it was around three times in bromegrass and russian wildrye pots due to the increases in na ion concentration as the water salinity increased soil sar increased and reached 24 46 which is highly sodic from the observed data tall fescue had the ability to utilize na ions to build up its biomass in raw water and that might explain the decline in na ions in raw water irrigated soil compared to other species bromegrass and alfalfa could not maintain an adequate ca na ratio and that resulted in the decline in biomass in diluted raw water compared to the control potassium has been reported to increase the soil microporosity resulting in increases in soil moisture capacity zaker and emami 2019 this was observed in the greenhouse in tall fescue pots irrigated with raw water and those pots remained wet for longer durations than other pots in consent with our results soil irrigated with reverse osmosis concentrate remained wet for longer than control treatment ben ali et al 2021 to control salt build up in plant tissues plants might reduce the root water uptake as a mechanism to survive the unpreparable conditions munns and tester 2008 toxicity is usually related to boron sodium and chloride concentrations ayres and wescot 1985 toxic and excessive levels of boron has been reported in arid and semi arid regions padbhushan and kumar 2017 based on soil saturated extract 5 10 mg l soil boron concentration represent semi tolerant and tolerant plants respectively while the toxicity threshold begins at 2 mg l soil boron concentration for sensitive plants gough et al 1980 our boron results exceeded the threshold of 2 mg l as reported previously in ro diluted raw and raw for all species however toxicity signs were observed in bromegrass species a previous study reported reduction in boron toxicity in wheat numerous vegetables and rootstock with increasing in salinity henry ezechi et al 2012 this could be what happened with those plants with increases in salinity thus surviving two harvests munns and tester 2008 reported that in soil 40 mm 2800 mg l of nacl concentration is toxic for most of the plants species soil sodium concentration in this study was about 1974 mg l in raw water in tall fescue pots which is the highest concentration among all the species toxicity level differs among plants species and depends on the plant s sensitivity for salts type and concentration thus some plants are sensitive to na while others are more sensitive for cl ayres and wescot 1985 some water plant and soil ion concentrations thresholds are included in table s3 to confirm our results continuous irrigation with the same treatments after the second harvest resulted in those species growing well again for two more full harvests this provides the evidence of the feasibility to utilize desalinated and diluted produced waters for irrigating forage plants 5 conclusion the present study investigated the effects of irrigating western wheatgrass alfalfa meadow bromegrass russian wildrye and tall fescue with ro desalinated produced water tap water diluted raw produced water and raw produced water as a valuable source of water in arid areas desalination of produced water reduced the salt buildup in soil and plants et decreased with increasing water salinity but wheatgrass alfalfa bromegrass and russian wildrye grew well during two harvests of the experiment and grew back again with continued ro tap and diluted raw irrigation after the second harvest however tall fescue survived even the raw irrigation alfalfa biomass decreased in diluted raw water while tall fescue was a tolerant species and can be irrigated with higher salinity water increasing soil salinity is a major issue when considering irrigation with produced water however a good leaching ratio especially in areas where water tables are deep can reduce na cl and other ions from building up in the rootzone and in plant tissue boron toxicity symptoms were noticed only in the meadow bromegrass there was no sign of toxicity regarding na and cl in all the surviving plants in this study with continued irrigation with saline water the research results promote the feasibility of using desalinated and diluted produced water to irrigate forage grasses however an effective monitoring system is required especially when raw or diluted raw is used for irrigation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

increasing salinity however plants continued to grow even after the third harvest utilizing desalinated and diluted produced waters as a valuable source of water for irrigation after treatment could alleviate water demand in arid oil producing regions of the world keywords produced water evapotranspiration russian wildrye alfalfa tall fescue data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the search for alternative water sources for agricultural purposes due to continued drought and reduction in fresh water supplies has become mandatory in arid areas to save water for human consumption oil and gas industries generate large volumes around 630 840 billion gallons year of water during extraction processes and the largest by product called produced water clark and veil 2009 veil 2011 this valuable source of water has been investigated as a useful source of irrigation in drylands in the us pica et al 2017 echchelh et al 2020 in the us west of the 98th meridian the federal national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes exemption allows the use of produced water for agricultural irrigation if oil and grease are less than 35 mg l mclaughlin et al 2020 reusing saline waters including produced water to irrigate croplands can contribute to food security flores et al 2015 however salt content of produced water could be extremely high therefore long term irrigation would cause decline in soil fertility and crop productivity and increase groundwater contamination echchelh et al 2020 high salinity organic matter load and toxic organic compounds are some of the main pollutant constituents in produced water that have to be accounted for prior to the reuse as an irrigation source pica et al 2017 treatment of the produced water to remove organics microbial contaminants and heavy metals prior to use will also be required ben ali et al 2021 2020 illustrated that irrigation with ro concentrate 5600 mg l negatively impacted soil properties and plant growth reduction in pecan carya illinoinensis chlorophyll height and growth was the results of irrigation with 5600 mg l saline water ben ali et al 2020 previous studies reported small decreases in halophytic species biomass irrigated with saline water 5600 7000 mg l flores et al 2016 ozturk et al 2018 decreases in tomato growth and yield were reported due to irrigation with

febrifuga irrigated due to the irrigation with saline water of concentrations ranging from 3500 to 7000 mg l sun et al 2022 changes in soil properties have to be monitored on a regular basis when produced water is utilized for irrigation burkhardt et al 2015 reported increasing accumulation of na and other salts in the soil with increasing concentration of produced water other studies conducted in arid areas have reported that produced water quality was responsible for increases in soil salinity and sodicity that negatively affected the soil structure and soil hydraulic properties biggs et al 2012 burkhardt et al 2015 consequently decreasing crop productivity yang et al 2020 echchelh et al 2020 pica et al 2017 reported decreases in rapeseed brassica napus l and switchgrass panicum virgatum l growth when irrigated with produced water up to 21 000 mg l salinity plant growth and consequently biomass production can be inhibited when soil salinity increase due to irrigation with produced water munns 2005 burkhardt et al 2015 reported a decline in wormwood and switchgrass growth with increases in produced water concentration due to high na content 1156 mg l a dilution to less than 1000 mg l of row produced water was utilized to irrigate greenhouse tomatoes martel valles et al 2014 the feasibility of utilizing produced water in crop irrigation is related to its ion and organics to that end desalination of produced water to acceptable levels of various plants could be a viable solution hpoc llc is one of the oil and gas companies that produces substantial amounts of produced water during oil explorations the company provided produced water source water of a salinity of about 8600 mg l in the state of new mexico produced water salinity is highly variable and can range from 8000 mg l to 250 000 mg l in the present study we created a salinity gradient of irrigation waters from 230 mg l to 8600 mg l to irrigate five forages species the objectives of this study were to i investigate the effects of produced water on seed germination and plants growth parameters and ii monitor the changes in the soil properties due to irrigation with produced water 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design and treatments two harvests from 22 may 2021 15 december 2021 were conducted in the fabian garcia science center greenhouse in las cruces nm usa 32 2805 n and 106 770 w elevation 1186 m an extended third harvest continued from december 15 2021 to february 27 2022 to confirm the viability of the experiment for each experimental harvest the experimental unit was a pot 15 cm deep and 15 cm in diameter packed with air dried and sieved through a 2 mm sieve loamy soil 52 56 sand 22 72 silt 24 72 clay with a bulk density of 1 43 g cm3 three produced water

source water and 427 mg l tap or city water table 1 were arranged in a completely randomized design with four replicates the raw produced water or source water was provided by hpoc and was first run through a carbon filter then desalinated using ro at the brackish groundwater national desalination research facility bgndrf alamogordo new mexico all treatment waters are shown in table 1 which also provides ph sodium adsorption ratio sar total dissolved solids tds and concentrations of some ions 2 2 plant selection western wheatgrass pascopyrum smithii alfalfa medicago sativa meadow bromegrass bromus biebersteinii russian wildrye psathyrostachys junceus and tall fescue schedonorus arundinaceus seeds were selected for the study because they are broadly adapted to grow in the colder climates of northern new mexico in a completely randomized design these five forage species were arranged in four replicates and irrigated with four water treatments in 80 pots 5 4 4 80 in each harvest randomization was achieved by generating random numbers using microsoft excel 2013 prior to sowing seeds were subjected to water test to check for seed viability twenty five seeds per pot of each species were planted in the top 2 cm of the soil the pots with the seedlings were irrigated with the four treatments from the beginning of the experiment depending on soil moisture content plants were irrigated five to six times every month germination percentage was calculated 30 days after seeding plants were harvested on september 22 2021 for the first harvest december 15 2021 for the second harvest and february 27 2021 for the extended third harvest 2 3 evapotranspiration evapotranspiration et was determined using a water balance equation shukla 2014 1 et ir r s ro dp where ir is the depth of irrigation cm r is rainfall cm r 0 s is the change in soil water storage between irrigations cm assumed 0 ro is runoff cm ro 0 and dp is the deep percolation cm leachate collected from the bottom of pots irrigations were made at a management allowed depletion of about 50 2 4 plant measurements each month plant heights from the base of the stem to the tip of the shoot chlorophyll content and leaf temperature were measured during the two harvests of the experiment using a tape measure spad meter and ir thermometer respectively the exact number of plants were allowed to grow for three months with no thinning during each harvest at the end of each harvest shoots were harvested and fresh weights were recorded the shoots were dried in the oven at 65 c for 48 h and dry weights were recorded for biomass calculation dried shoots were ground and packed in small storage bags and sent to ag source laboratory lincoln nebraska for chemical analysis along with irrigation water and leachate samples 2 5 soil bulk density and chemical analysis core samples were collected from each of the pots under irrigation salinity treatments at the end of the experiment soil bulk density was determined using cores blake and hartge 1986 loose soil samples were collected from the pots air dried mixed and sieved through a 2 mm sieve prior to shipping them to the ag source laboratories lincoln nebraska for chemical analysis sodium adsorption ratio sar was calculated based on robbins 1983 using the following equation 2 sar na 1 ca 2 mg 2 2 where na is sodium ion concentration meq l ca is calcium ion concentration meq l and mg is magnesium ion concentration meq l 2 6 statistical analysis the experimental design was a completely randomized design with four replications all statistical analyses were performed using sas software v 9 4 differences due to treatments on plant germination and growth were determined using one way analysis of variance anova and means were separated using the least significant difference lsd an alpha level of 0 05 was used to determine statistical significance 3 results 3 1 greenhouse meteorology greenhouse temperatures ranged from 15 1 to 46 9 c prior to first harvest 13 4 33 5 c before the second harvest and 13 7 28 4 c prior to the third harvest fig 1 relative humidity in the greenhouse ranged from 10 to 88 12 80 and 16 4 50 2 for the three harvests respectively fig 1 daily light integral dli is important for plant growth development yield and quality dli was 16 21 19 82 and 18 63 mol m2 day for the three harvests respectively fig 1 at day 104 of the experiment period greenhouse shade was removed which explained the increase in dli at that time 3 2 seed germination table 2 shows the germination percentage of the five forage species only bromegrass and tall fescue germinated in raw water table 2 bromegrass had an 86 germination in ro water but 100 in raw water however plants did not survive beyond the first month of

differences were recorded in the second measurement in august for alfalfa heights and spad value table 3 for bromegrass the lowest recorded height in july was in raw irrigated water while the spad

russian wildrye height was similar in ro tap and diluted raw water while the spad value was higher in diluted raw water than ro and tap water table 3 this trend shifted in august when height was greater in the diluted raw irrigation with no differences observed in the spad value table 3 greater tall fescue height was recorded in tap water while the lowest height was recorded in raw water whereas the spad value was greater in the raw water in july table 3 a similar trend was observed in august table 3 diluted raw irrigation increased spad value of wheatgrass and russian wildrye while decreased the spad value of bromegrass decreases in tall fescue heights as the irrigation water salinity increases in the second harvest first and second measurements in october and november wheatgrass height and spad value were greater numerically in diluted raw than ro and tap water table 4 no differences were observed with regard to alfalfa height in october and november table 4 and the spad value was the lowest in diluted raw irrigation and of with tap irrigation in october and november respectively table 4 the observations illustrated no differences among the treatments with regard to bromegrass height and spad value for both measurement time table 4 russian wildrye was the tallest and spad value was the highest in diluted raw water in october table 4 however in november no differences between the grass heights were observed although spad value remained higher in diluted raw irrigation than ro and tap table 4 tall fescue grass showed only numerical differences with regard to height and spad value with the raw treatment in october table 4 in november however the height of 19 cm and spad value of 22 15 were recorded with raw water table 4 wheatgrass russian wildrye and tall fescue height and spad value increased with increasing water salinity while alfalfa height and spad value decreased with increases in water salinity 3 6 leachate ions concentrate collected leachate water samples from all the five forage species showed increases in na mg ca and cl ion concentration in produced water compared with the tap water for the two measurement times during the first harvest table 5 large increases in na ions followed by cl from resulted leachate from the pots irrigated with raw and diluted raw water leachate water of the diluted raw and raw irrigation was considered sodic sar 13 and saline ec 2800 mg l for the two times measurements for the first harvest table 5 s1 similarly in the second harvest the ion concentrations were higher in the leachate water samples with increasing salt concentration of the irrigation treatment table 6 s2 similar to the first harvest leachate water in the second harvest was considered saline and sodic in raw and diluted raw irrigation table 6 s2 increases in irrigation water salinity increased the leachate water na mg ca and cl ions concentration and sar 3 7 plants ion contents the plant tissue samples at the end of the first harvest showed non significant differences with regard to total n with increasing irrigation water salinity table 7 alfalfa did not show a significant difference in phosphorus content with increasing treatment salinity table 7 nonsignificant differences were observed in bromegrass samples with regard to p k ca mn fe and s content with increasing irrigation water salinity tables 7 8 increasing irrigation water salinity did not significantly affect the content of p mg fe and al in russian wildrye tables 7 8 increases in irrigation water salinity had no significant effect on the mg ca and zn concentration in tall fescue table 7 increases in irrigation water salinity diluted raw significantly decreased the concentration of p k mg ca zn fe and al in wheatgrass tissue while mn s and na increased in wheatgrass tissue tables 7 8 with the increases in water salinity diluted raw k and ca in alfalfa decreased table 7 while mg mn s and na increased tables 7 8 increases in mg s zn and na content in bromegrass can be observed with increases in water salinity diluted raw whereas b decreased tables 7 8 russian wildrye showed significant increases in mg mn s and na ion concentrations with increases in irrigation water salinity from ro to diluted raw tables 7 8 while k ca zn and b decreased tables 7 8 tall fescue s fe b al s and na ion concentrations increased with increases in water salinity raw table 8 however p k mn and b decreased tables 7 8 tables 9 and 10 show the plants ion concentrations in the second harvest the second harvest continued to show similar trends as the first harvest with regard to the ion concentration of forage species salts accumulation in plant tissues can be observed with increases in salt uptake when comparing the results of the two harvests however species survived both harvests and also grew back again after the second harvest with continued irrigation with the same treatments 3 8 soil bulk density organic matter ph and electrical conductivity ec soil bulk density at the end of the experiment is presented in table 11 within species the results indicated a slight increase in soil bulk density with continued irrigation with diluted raw however this increase was not statistically significant table 11 a significant increase in soil bulk density can be observed in raw irrigated pots followed by diluted raw within tall fescue illustrating that increases in irrigation water salinity increased soil bulk density table 11 pots irrigated with ro and diluted raw showed significant decline in soil om compared with the control for wheatgrass alfalfa bromegrass and russian wildrye species table 11 for tall fescue species the decline in soil om continued in ro and diluted water however the lowest soil om was recorded in raw water irrigated soil table 11 the soil ph trend was near neutral in ro water however alkalinity increased as water salinity increased table 11 soil ec increased in diluted raw for wheatgrass alfalfa bromegrass and russian wildrye pots the highest ec recorded was in raw water in tall fescue followed by diluted raw table 11 3 9 soil ions concentrations for wheatgrass soil p fe and b decreased with increases in salinity while k s mg ca na significantly increased tables 12 13 in alfalfa pots irrigated with diluted raw soil n fe and b significantly decreased while k s na increased in pots irrigated with diluted raw tables 12 13 reduction in soil k mg ca and b ion concentrations resulted in diluted raw whereas s na increased in bromegrass pots irrigated with diluted raw tables 12 13 russian wildrye pots showed increases in soil s and na with increasing water salinity while k mg and b decreased tables 12 13 increases were seen in soil p s na mn and fe ion concentrations in tall fescue pots irrigated with raw water however mg ca and b decreased table 13 soil sar significantly increased in diluted raw water pots of wheatgrass alfalfa and bromegrass and was considered saline soil but not sodic table 13 in tall fescue pots soil in raw water was considered saline and sodic table 13 4 discussion 4 1 seed germination forage species germination results showed differences in their response to the four irrigation treatments this could be due to their level of tolerance to various levels of saline water flores et al 2015 with regard to germination rate reported similarities between six halophytic species x triticosecale atriplex canescens hordeum vulgare lepidium alyssoides distichlis stricta and panicum virgatum irrigated with saline water up to 7000 mg l as results showed russian wildrye germination percentage was the lowest among the species utilized in this study and that might be due to the seeds vitality since it was for all three treatments as the level of salinity increased alfalfa wheatgrass bromegrass and russian wildrye germination percentages decreased and never germinated under raw water 8610 mg l and this emphasized that these species are more sensitive to increases in water salinity among the five species tall fescue species germinated well with raw water which shows suitability of this species for irrigation with raw water 4 2 plant dry biomass within species alfalfa biomass decreased with diluted raw however compared with other species alfalfa produced higher dry biomass in ro tap and diluted raw water this could be due to the rapid growth of alfalfa aboveground biomass compared with the other grass species this agrees with a previous study comparing the growth of alfalfa and triticale irrigated with various levels of saline water up to 5600 mg l where alfalfa growth decreased with increasing irrigation water salinity kankarla et al 2019 barley hordeum vulgare grew well with high biomass as the irrigation treatment salinity increased katerji et al 2009 in contrast with increasing water salinity khan and glenn 1996 reported reduction in barley biomass tall fescue grew well in raw up to 8610 mg l therefore it can be considered a halophyte kankarla et al 2019 and ozturk et al 2018 reported no reduction in triticale biomass irrigated with 5600 and 7000 mg l saline water respectively which agrees with our finding for tall fescue species 4 3 evapotranspiration continuous irrigation with saline water caused decreases in cumulative et for all five species and resulted in decreased plant growth and biomass yang et al 2020 reported related results when et of tomato decreased with increasing irrigation water salinity ranged between 1400 and 4200 mg l on accord with this study decreases in pecan et with increasing irrigation water salinity up to 5600 mg l have been reported ben ali et al 2021 however no changes in plant biomass and et were reported when irrigation up to 7000 mg l was applied to halophytic species ozturk et al 2018 4 4 plant height and spad value the results indicated no significant changes in the forage species with continued irrigation with diluted raw and tall fescue with raw water irrigation on the contrary pessarakli 2011 reported decreases in salt grass species distichlis spicata l shoot length with increasing water salinity spad value was higher in tap and diluted raw water irrigated plants than with ro treatment a decrease in chlorophyll content was reported on pecan leaves irrigated with water up to 5600 mg l ben ali et al 2020 tomato chlorophyll content decreased with increases in salinity taffouo et al 2010 zhang et al 2016 li et al 2018 reported decreases in chlorophyll content of eremochloa ophiuroids irrigated with nacl dominant saline water 4 5 plant ion contents three major tools to distinguish ions toxicity are plant analysis soil testing and field observations mccauley et al 2009 the irrigation water showed increases in na ca mg and cl with increasing salinity of water these ions respond in one of paths leach out of the soil accumulate in the soil or accumulate in plants tissue by root water uptake as the results indicated na ca mg and cl ions presented in the plants tissues increased as the treatment salinity increased wheatgrass alfalfa bromegrass russian wildrye and tall fescue gained and accumulate na and cl and which may have led to the decreases in the biomass by increasing water salinity these results are consistent with a previous study that applied saline water on alfalfa and triticale kankarla et al 2019 pica et al 2017 reported that produced water with a na concentration of 1156 mg l inhibited sweet wormwood and switchgrass growth tall fescue thrived and grew back after the two harvests despite the na content in raw water being 59 times greater than in the control demonstrating that tall fescue is more tolerant to high na levels than other species a previous study reported that the tolerance of tissue to accumulated na or cl osmotic stress tolerance and na or cl exclusion are the three adaptation types of plant to salinity stress munns and tester 2008 and plants differ in their response to na and cl accumulation tavakkoli et al 2010 ca performs a significant role in mitigating salt toxicity which is associated with the selective effect of k na by controlling the flow of na through non selective ion channels rahneshan et al 2018 the results showed decreases in ca in raw irrigated species meaning that tall fescue might have the potential of utilizing na for growth while higher ca might assist wheatgrass alfalfa bromegrass and russian wildrye to reduce the toxic effects of na on their growth this role might be the reason for the grasses survival since the increases in na were higher with increases in the treatment s salinity however these plants might have a mechanism that controls the increases in na and cl by sequestering these ions in the vacuoles to manage low concentrations in the cytoplasm therefore resulting in good metabolism kankarla et al 2019 nitrogen is responsible for nucleic acid chlorophyll and protein production mccauley et al 2009 magnesium has a key role on enzyme activation and is related to chlorophyll content ben ali et al 2020 in our study mg declined as the irrigation water increased which might explain the increases in chlorophyll content by increasing water salinity a previous study mentioned that increased mg decreased chlorophyll content of pecan trees irrigated with saline water up to 5600 mg l ben ali et al 2020 phosphorus reduction causes interruption in cell signaling and protein synthesis epstein and bloom 2005 our results showed decreases in p concentration in the forage tissues with increasing water salinity these results agreed with a previous study hussain et al 2014 potassium s role is to activate enzymes contributed with atp production and to regulate photosynthetic presses epstein and bloom 2005 the increases in na might eliminate plant k uptake and interrupt photosynthesis regulation hussain et al 2014 in this study k decreased in wheatgrass bromegrass and tall fescue tissues with increased na concentration the sulfur ion is important for chlorophyll and protein synthesis mccauley et al 2009 our results showed increases in s ions when water salinity increased zinc is used primarily for internode elongation and chlorophyll therefore any deficiency can affect the plants growth mccauley et al 2009 the forage species presented reduction in zn as the irrigation water salinity increased however growth was not affected iron is a principal element for plant respiration mccauley et al 2009 fe decreased with increased water salinity however the plant s growth was not clearly affected manganese is important in chloroplasts where photosynthesis takes place mccauley et al 2009 in this study mn declined with increased water salinity with all the forage species boron has a role on cell wall formation and reproductive tissue mccauley et al 2009 boron can be toxic to plants however plants are varied in acceptable concentrations that they can manage mccauley et al 2009 even with the increases in b concentration in the forages irrigated with ro and raw plant species did not show any signs of b toxicity such as chlorosis and necrosis meaning that the plants could have managed the increase in b concentration one exception was with bromegrass showing signs of b toxicity due to the increases in b concentration with ro irrigation treatment 4 6 soil bulk density organic matter ph and ec as the water salinity increased with continuous irrigation soil bulk density increased this was due to salt precipitation in the soil pores with attendant decreases in the pores size in contrast al nabulsi 2001 reported decreases in soil bulk density when irrigated with 7700 mg l sodic drainage water while ben ali et al 2021 reported no differences with continuous irrigation with saline water up to 5600 mg l our results indicated significant reduction in soil om as the salinity increased in agreement with our findings zhang et al 2019 also reported a reduction in om and increases in alkalinity with increasing salinity results indicated that as the irrigation water salinity increased soil ec significantly increased this increase however was not as large as expected and this was due to the leaching fraction which ranged between 40 and 50 of the irrigation water amount which prevented salt build up in the soil according to ayres and wescot 1985 leachate of 50 could control salt build up in the soil reflecting in reduced salt accumulation in plants in consent with this study previous greenhouse studies reported greater increases in soil ec than ours along with continued irrigation with brackish water ec 2870 7000 mg l to irrigate halophytic species flores et al 2016 ozturk et al 2018 4 7 leachate and soil ion concentrations leaching accumulation and root uptake are the three major pathways for water and soil ion transport irrigation with produced water could increase salinity and sodicity which can be observed on leachate water results collected from the pots as the water salinity concentration increased the leachate became more saline and sodic the increase in treatment salinity led to leaching of mg ca na and cl in the collected leachate samples comparable results were reported with alfalfa species irrigated with various levels of saline water kankarla et al 2019 compared to the control irrigated soil soil na concentration was five times higher in diluted raw water in wheatgrass and alfalfa pots while it was around three times in bromegrass and russian wildrye pots due to the increases in na ion concentration as the water salinity increased soil sar increased and reached 24 46 which is highly sodic from the observed data tall fescue had the ability to utilize na ions to build up its biomass in raw water and that might explain the decline in na ions in raw water irrigated soil compared to other species bromegrass and alfalfa could not maintain an adequate ca na ratio and that resulted in the decline in biomass in diluted raw water compared to the control potassium has been reported to increase the soil microporosity resulting in increases in soil moisture capacity zaker and emami 2019 this was observed in the greenhouse in tall fescue pots irrigated with raw water and those pots remained wet for longer durations than other pots in consent with our results soil irrigated with reverse osmosis concentrate remained wet for longer than control treatment ben ali et al 2021 to control salt build up in plant tissues plants might reduce the root water uptake as a mechanism to survive the unpreparable conditions munns and tester 2008 toxicity is usually related to boron sodium and chloride concentrations ayres and wescot 1985 toxic and excessive levels of boron has been reported in arid and semi arid regions padbhushan and kumar 2017 based on soil saturated extract 5 10 mg l soil boron concentration represent semi tolerant and tolerant plants respectively while the toxicity threshold begins at 2 mg l soil boron concentration for sensitive plants gough et al 1980 our boron results exceeded the threshold of 2 mg l as reported previously in ro diluted raw and raw for all species however toxicity signs were observed in bromegrass species a previous study reported reduction in boron toxicity in wheat numerous vegetables and rootstock with increasing in salinity henry ezechi et al 2012 this could be what happened with those plants with increases in salinity thus surviving two harvests munns and tester 2008 reported that in soil 40 mm 2800 mg l of nacl concentration is toxic for most of the plants species soil sodium concentration in this study was about 1974 mg l in raw water in tall fescue pots which is the highest concentration among all the species toxicity level differs among plants species and depends on the plant s sensitivity for salts type and concentration thus some plants are sensitive to na while others are more sensitive for cl ayres and wescot 1985 some water plant and soil ion concentrations thresholds are included in table s3 to confirm our results continuous irrigation with the same treatments after the second harvest resulted in those species growing well again for two more full harvests this provides the evidence of the feasibility to utilize desalinated and diluted produced waters for irrigating forage plants 5 conclusion the present study investigated the effects of irrigating western wheatgrass alfalfa meadow bromegrass russian wildrye and tall fescue with ro desalinated produced water tap water diluted raw produced water and raw produced water as a valuable source of water in arid areas desalination of produced water reduced the salt buildup in soil and plants et decreased with increasing water salinity but wheatgrass alfalfa bromegrass and russian wildrye grew well during two harvests of the experiment and grew back again with continued ro tap and diluted raw irrigation after the second harvest however tall fescue survived even the raw irrigation alfalfa biomass decreased in diluted raw water while tall fescue was a tolerant species and can be irrigated with higher salinity water increasing soil salinity is a major issue when considering irrigation with produced water however a good leaching ratio especially in areas where water tables are deep can reduce na cl and other ions from building up in the rootzone and in plant tissue boron toxicity symptoms were noticed only in the meadow bromegrass there was no sign of toxicity regarding na and cl in all the surviving plants in this study with continued irrigation with saline water the research results promote the feasibility of using desalinated and diluted produced water to irrigate forage grasses however an effective monitoring system is required especially when raw or diluted raw is used for irrigation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

9257,irrigated agriculture requires the implementation of innovative tools to improve irrigation water management and accurate estimation of actual evapotranspiration eta such as remote sensing based methodology this study aimed to evaluate the irrigation management and estimating evapotranspiration through the geesebal a new tool for automated estimation of eta based on the surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal and a simplified version of the calibration using inverse modeling at extreme conditions cimec process for the endmembers selection implemented into the google earth engine gee environment geesebal has not been used yet in brazil for irrigation proposes and in this research it was applied to estimate eta using landsat images and era5 land as meteorological inputs in the largest sugarcane producing region of the world in brazil for two ratoon seasons by comparing daily eta with values obtained from eddy covariance ec data energy balance components using geesebal were consistent with the measured data and daily eta presenting rmse of 0 46 mm with r2 0 97 modeled eta and kc were similar for the two seasons although somewhat overestimated for the fifth ratoon when compared to the ec data mainly during high atmospheric demand crop mid stage still the kc values were similar to the standard values available in the literature and measured flux tower data for the two ratoons seasons with eta from geesebal it was possible to identify water stress over the growing seasons using the remote sensing based soil water balance which occurred mainly during the phase after the crop reached the peak kc full cover stage when the irrigation depth required was very high this analysis showed that geesebal has a significant potential for assessment of eta for irrigation monitoring and management even in missing climate data areas allowing important advances in water resources management for sugarcane and other irrigated crops at field or regional scales keywords water productivity landsat images era5 eddy covariance data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction rapid population growth has increasingly raised concerns in the global community about the role of agricultural production on the high demand for food and its impact on ecosystem sustainability according to prb population reference bureau 2020 the global population will reach almost 10 billion people in 2050 and food production is expected to increase by 35 56 to meet the demand dijk et al 2021 tropical climate countries with an extensive territorial area such as brazil are well known as important global food producers and exporters serving as a key supplier of food and other commodities such as fiber and biofuels however even in large countries agricultural lands are limited and water resources are increasingly scarce due to climate extremes although brazil is the world s largest sugarcane producer with an estimated production of more than 650 million tons in 8 6 million hectares most sugarcane fields are under rainfed conditions and the average yield is around 69 mg ha 1 conab 2021 to overcome low yields and increase efficiency in land use to boost food security irrigation practices have been adopted and the expansion rate of irrigation has grown in the country for irrigation management satellite images provide an excellent means for determining and mapping the spatial and temporal eta having great potential for improving irrigation management by providing eta estimations for large land surface areas using a minimal amount of ground data some recent studies have used remote sensing rs models successfully to monitor and improve irrigation management worldwide campos et al 2016 campos et al 2018 venancio et al 2019 foster et al 2019 the choice of an eta model depends on several factors including the type of application spatial and temporal resolutions meteorological inputs and the expected model advantages and limitations zhang et al 2016 rs based methodologies for estimating eta can be separated into two main groups 1 vegetation indexes based models where eta is estimated based on the basal crop coefficient as a function of the spectral reflectance values neale et al 1989 derived from vegetation indexes such as land surface evapotranspiration mod16 mu et al 2011 and 2 land surface temperature based models based on the energy balance approach these models can be one source when eta is estimated for soil and vegetation together as a single layer such as the well known sebal bastiaanssen et al 1998a and metric allen et al 2007 and two sources when et is estimated for soil and vegetation individually such as the two source energy balance tseb norman et al 1995 and alex disalex model anderson et al 1997 mecikalski et al 1999 norman et al 2003 yet these models use orbital imagery and ground based meteorological data and depending on the model can also use field data to estimate the components of the energy balance latent and sensible heat and soil heat flux and eta among several surface temperature ts based models sebal computes eta from satellite images and

bastiaanssen et al 2005 bhattarai et al 2012 ruhoff et al 2012 tang et al 2013 wagle et al 2017 yang et al 2012 the main component of the algorithm is the internal process to estimate the near surface temperature gradient dt which is based on the selection of endmembers that represent the extremes of the wet cold and dry hot eta spectrum allen et al 2007 bastiaanssen et al 1998a while this was manually performed in early applications an algorithm based on surface temperature and normalized deviation vegetation index ndvi percentiles using the calibration inverse modeling at extreme conditions cimec has allowed the automatic selection of endmember candidates pixels allen et al 2013 this algorithm enabled the use of multiple images within a fully automated eta framework improving and facilitating the assessment of time series based on rs images bhattarai et al 2017 jaafar and ahmad 2019 considering the importance of estimating et worldwide for water resources management even in isolated areas where ground data is not available such as automatic weather station to provide meteorological data this might be a critical aspect that can be overcome using an open source sebal framework implemented within the google earth engine gee through application programming interface api named geesebal laipelt et al 2021 reflecting the importance of accurate eta estimates for irrigation monitoring and management through remote sensing even in areas where meteorological data is scarce the main goals of this study was to use an open source sebal framework implemented into

over two sugarcane growing seasons two years grown in the northwest state of são paulo brazil using current landsat 8 oli and landsat 7 etm images and the state of the art meteorological reanalysis from era5 land this approach has not been used in brazil yet for irrigation proposes in sugarcane and could be a great initiative to encourage the researcher community to use remote sensing technique with only orbital data without using meteorological inputs from terrestrial data to estimate the energy balance components and et collaborating with the advance in monitoring the crop water management additionally an evaluation of the performance results of the estimated energy balance eb components and eta using geesebal against field data obtained from the turbulent flux data eddy covariance was conducted 2 material and methods 2 1 study site this research was carried out in a commercial field of 24 ha in the western state of são paulo latitude 20 43 43 6 s longitude 51º16 30 3 o 360 m above

june 2018 with the highest data quality available tier 1 a total of 77 images were used cloud cover filters from the cfmask algorithm foga et al 2017 were used to identify clouds and shadows pixels for each image for global instantaneous meteorological inputs we used data from the era5 land reanalysis dataset hersbach et al 2020 munoz sabater et al 2021 at the hourly temporal resolution including air temperature at 2 m tair dew point temperature tdew and eastward and northward wind speed at 2 m at the time of landsat satellite overpass relative humidity rh was estimated following shuttleworth 2012 land surface temperature lst was adjusted to a common elevation datum tsdem using digital elevation data from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm considering an average lapse rate of 6 5 c km 1 and slope effects also were corrected according to jaafar and ahmad 2019 time series soil adjusted vegetation index known as savi vermote et al 2016 masek et al 2006 was used

inputs such as atmospherically corrected land surface reflectance and brightness temperature image collection from landsat 7 and 8 tier 1 was used to run geesebal also it was implemented cloud cover filters from the cfmask algorithm for each image foga et al 2017 to improve the image quality for global meteorological inputs we used data from the era5 land reanalysis dataset hersbach et al 2020 munoz sabater et al 2021 at hourly data including air temperature at 2 m tair dew point temperature tdew and eastward and northward wind speed at 10 m u at the time of landsat satellite overpass about the estimation of relative humidity rh we followed shuttleworth 2012 era5 land was selected mainly due to its global coverage and high spatial and temporal resolution when compared to other reanalysis data available in gee additionally we used incoming shortwave radiation data global radiation aggregated at daily time step furthermore the digital elevation model from srtm was also used for the ts correction 2 4 hot and cold endmembers automated calibration the automated statistical algorithm to select the hot and cold endmembers is based on a simplified version of the cimec algorithm used in metric allen et al 2013 subsequently evaluated by morton et al 2013 where percentiles of lst and normalized difference vegetation index ndvi values are used to select endmember candidates the cimec procedure is used to calibrate the dt function of eq 2 the cimec process is applied by inverting eq 6 for dt after solving eq 1 for h for the two extreme endpoint conditions in the image representing nearly full le cold endmember and nearly zero le hot endmember 6 h pc p dt r ah where q is air density kg m3 cp is air specific heat j kg k dt k is the temperature difference between two heights in a near surface blended layer and rah is the aerodynamic resistance to heat transport s m between two heights to solve the iteration process it is necessary to select hot and cold endmembers a linear relationship between ts and dt is assumed bastiaanssen et al 1998a eq 7 where a and b coefficients are empirically determined for each image 7 dt a bt the cold wet endmember candidates are selected in well vegetated areas where h is assumed to be zero and maximum le for a well watered agricultural field at the full cover canopy while for the hot dry endmember candidates the le is assumed to be zero and maximum h for an agricultural field having no green vegetation and dry soil surface layer usually the cold endmember is selected within a set of candidates with the highest ndvi 5 and the lowest ts 20 percentiles conversely the hot endmember is selected based on the lowest ndvi 10 and the highest ts 20 percentiles within geesebal these ranges are set as default standard however the user can easily select other percentile values as input parameters according to hydrometeorological conditions since the standard percentiles were calibrated and recommended for semiarid climates allen et al 2013 in this study we used the percentiles for cold pixels 5 ndvi 1 ts and hot pixels 1 ndvi 10 ts 2 5 field data of evapotranspiration eddy covariance measurements modeled energy balance components and eta24 h were compared to measured data provided by an eddy covariance flux tower installed in the field used to measure the micrometeorological variables and the energy balance components for estimating evapotranspiration covering the two ratoon seasons analyzed the ec consists of a three dimensional sonic anemometer and an infrared gas analyzer irgason campbell scientific logan utah usa positioned considering the prevailing wind direction operated by a data logger cr 3000 campbell scientific instruments utah usa to record raw high frequency data at 10 hz the micrometeorological variables measured above the canopy were net radiation cnr4 net radiometer kipp zonen delft netherlands and precipitation cs700 l hydrological services pty ltd sydney australia this equipment was positioned 5 m above the soil surface on the ground two soil heat flux plates were installed to measure the heat flow in the soil hfp01 l campbell scientific inc logan utah usa low frequency data were collected continuously at 5 second intervals averaging over 30 min the raw data from the ec system 10 hz were processed using eddypro advanced software licor 2020a and tovi software licor 2020b was used for data gap filling and flow partitioning every 30 min the flux data obtained over the two ratoons on average showed an energy balance closure on a daily scale of about 77 more details in bispo 2020 in some cases this results in a considerable amount of available energy rn g not being accounted for in the partitioning of latent and sensitive heat flux λe h which could cause significant discrepancies in the comparisons with the results from remote sensing the errors inherent in rn net radiation λe latent heat flux h sensitive heat flux and g heat flux in the soil are reported as 5 10 15 20 15 20 and 20 30 respectively according to foken 2008 vickers et al 2010 for this reason the bowen ratio values obtained with the flux tower data were used to adjust λe and h by forcing the closure following the procedure suggested by twine et al 2000 the λe values that represent the energy per unit area and per unit time were converted into evapotranspiration depth for each time interval and then 24 h accumulated resulting in actual daily evapotranspiration eta24 h also an instantaneous evaporative fraction ef was estimated considering the energy available used by the plants rn g divided by the surface energy balance directly relates to evapotranspiration λe to evaluate the effectiveness of geesebal the time series python function was used by selecting the pixels over the upwind footprint to estimate instantaneous modeled energy balance components and et24 h from geesebal and the modeled data were compared to ground data eddy flux tower daily crop coefficient kc was estimated using daily geesebal eta24 h satellite overpasses day considering the entire sugarcane area divided by eto from the weather station following eq 8 allen et al 1998 then kc values from satellite overpasses day were interpolated using gdd to estimate daily kc for the entire sugarcane season with the daily kc it was possible to estimate daily eta multiplying daily kc to eto crop water productivity wp was estimated by dividing the stalk yield kg per ha by the modeled accumulated eta for both growing seasons eq 9 8 kc eta eto where kc is the crop coefficient eta is the actual daily evapotranspiration mm eto is the reference evapotranspiration mm 9 wp yield et where wp is the crop water productivity kg m3 and et is the total evapotranspiration in m 3 per ha after getting geesebal eta24 h the remote sensing based soil water balance rs swb was calculated for each sugarcane season following allen et al 1998 considering the soil attributes data soil water depletion fraction p adjusted based on etc and effective rooting depth varying from 0 60 m crop initial stage to 0 80 m crop late stage 2 6 statistical analysis the energy balance components and the eta estimated by geesebal were compared with the data measured in the field through the ec flux tower to measure the accuracy of the model the r square rmse root mean squared error and bias indicators were applied according to eqs 10 and 11 respectively 10 rmse i 1 n y i ȳ i 2 n where rmse is the root mean squared error n is the sample size y is the observed variable ȳ is the modeled variable 11 bias i 0 n y i ȳ i n where n is the sample size y is the observed variable ȳ is the modeled variable 3 results overall the fourth and fifth growing seasons had similar average maximum and minimum temperatures equal to 30 9 3 8 c and 31 4 3 6 c for maximum temperature and 18 2 3 0 c and 17 9 3 7 c for minimum temperature respectively with temperature average equal to 24 6 c for both seasons 10 5 greater than the historical average for the region 23 3 c fig 3 accumulated precipitation was 988 mm and 974 mm in the 4th and 5th ratoon seasons respectively on average 21 lower than the average historical amount of 1242 mm for both ratoons precipitation was irregular over the growing seasons resulting in only 32 days and 31 days with precipitation over 10 mm respectively distributed from october to february rainy season 3 1 geesebal energy balance validation accord to fig 4 rn le h eta and ef presented r2 over 0 90 for all variables except g which was equal to 0 86 also except for g all the eb components presented low rmse and bias however despite the reasonable values of g 9 2 w m 2 and bias 14 9 w m 2 g values have little influence on eb because their values are considered very low less than 5 of rn in this study the table 2 summarize the statistical indices for all modeled geesebal and measured flux tower energy balance components and eta 3 2 crop development and crop evapotranspiration according to fig 5 the lowest savi values considering landsat 7 and landsat 8 images were 0 18 and 0 20 for the 4th and 5th ratoons respectively at the beginning of the respective crop seasons due to soil covered with sugarcane straw post harvest crop residues after harvest the savi values decrease to close to bare soil values around 0 12 the maximum savi value observed was 0 61 at 222 days after harvest dah for the 4th ratoon and 0 60 at 169 dah for the 5th ratoon in this study the savi values at harvest were 0 44 and 0 49 for the 4th and 5th ratoons respectively for both growing seasons savi values were similar and followed the development of the plants allowing the farmers to make decisions monitoring the crop stage such as the full cover stage at peak savi both growing seasons in february and the beginning of stalk maturity stage when savi start to decrease influenced by the reduction of green lai this occurred when savi reached about 0 50 by may and irrigation is cut off to promote the concentration of carbohydrates in the stalks and to improve the sugar and ethanol yields we observed that geesebal accurately modeled the eta values represented spatially and temporally as shown in fig 6 landsat 8 for each crop development stage and followed the savi values fig 4 therefore low savi values a few days after harvesting presented also low eta values due to the low leaf area of the plants however as savi increases eta also increased until it reached its maximum value when plants reached maximum vegetation cover savi greater than 55 at the beginning of the stalk maturation stage consequently due to a decrease in savi values the eta also decreased as shown in fig 6 dah4th 340 and dah5th 337 the kc values were modeled for each satellite overpass time using the eta modeled from the geesebal and the eto values from the meteorological station fig 7 with the kc values plotted over the gdd of the ratoon s cycles a kc gdd relationship is obtained with an r2 equal to 0 77 and 0 76 for the 4th and 5th growing seasons following acceptably the kc measured by the ec system we noticed for the 5th ratoon the modeled kc values were slightly overestimated compared to daily measured data mainly due to greater eta variability at the late stage the results from modeled kc values were extrapolated to the entire seasons based on the kc gdd relationship and daily evapotranspiration estimations daily eta were done and compared to measured data fig 8 about the 4th ratoon the data presented r2 equal to 0 89 rmse equal to 0 76 and less than 2 underestimating of eta compared to de flux tower regarding the 5th ratoon as modeled kc values were overestimated the results affected the modeled eta and on average overestimating the evapotranspiration by about 15 however there was a low rmse 0 62 and r2 equal to 0 88 maximum modeled daily kc values were 1 12 and 1 14 for the 4th and 5th ratoon seasons and on average 0 88 4th ratoon and 0 86 5th ratoon very close to the ec system for the 4th ratoon 0 86 and the 5th ratoon following the eta values the kc from ec system was about 20 lower kc 0 71 considering the two growing seasons as shown in fig 9 the eta presented great results following the measured eta by the ec and savi values and the modeled accumulated eta was 1266 mm and 1248 for the 4th and 5th ratoons respectively representing water productivity of 10 and 9 7 kg m 3 overall all the wp values were very similar between the growing seasons because the similar yields 127 and 121 mg ha 1 irrigation precipitation and eto were very close between seasons so an efficient way of increasing wp for sugarcane is through irrigation increasing water supply to avoid water stress and ensure high stalk yields in this study there were increments of 58 and 52 mg ha 1 greater than the national yield for the 4th and 5th ratoons respectively after applying 584 and 560 mm of irrigation i e an increase of 10 and 10 8 mg per mm of water applied for each growing season the eta and kc variability for each vegetative stage are summarized in fig 10 3 3 the remote sensing based soil water balance with modeled eta it was possible to estimate the rs swb for the two ratoon seasons fig 11 we observed water stress occurring during the development stage of the crop and the irrigation system was not able to apply the required water demand which resulted in water stress for the plants for the 4th total of 584 mm and 5th total of 560 mm growing seasons 4 discussion regarding the weather data for the two sugarcane growing seasons fig 3 it was favorable to the sugarcane development because sugarcane requires high temperatures and humidity for reaching high yields the minimum and maximum temperature must be between 20 c and 35 c marin et al 2014 vianna et al 2020 which has occurred for almost the entire period of cultivation sugarcane in brazil is purposefully planted in the dry season june and july to be harvested after one year during the dry season to increase the total recoverable sugar trs concentration in the stalk resulting in higher sugarcane quality and ability to be transformed into sugar or ethanol marin et al 2021 precipitation was poorly distributed during the evaluated period requiring supplementation via irrigation mainly during the regrowth stage right after harvest irrigation is required mainly after harvesting to ensure the regrowth of the ratoons and optimal stalk development until physiological maturity inman bamber et al 1994 being essential to maintain proper soil water content in the root zone for attaining high yields the eb components and eta values agreed very well with those measured by the ec system fig 4 despite the reasonable values of g its values have little influence on eb because their values are considered very low less than 5 of rn in this study according to mukaka 2012 the eb components values shown in this study indicated the accurate performance of geesebal with similar results also observed by yang et al 2018 and campos et al 2017 savi values fig 5 after reach the peak values full cover has its values decreased because of the maturation stage the savi values decrease until harvest due to the reduction in green leaf area index lai which is expected in this stage as shown in gonçalves et al 2017 and silva et al 2012 vegetation indices such as savi have been used to monitor irrigated sugarcane and other crops supporting water management as described in zhang et al 2015 venancio et al 2020 and campos et al 2017 geesebal accurately modeled the eta values spatially and over growing seasons fig 6 for each crop development stage as savi represents the vegetative vigor of the plants we expect that any changes in savi values will impact the eta values because the increase or decrease in absorbed radiation in the visible red and near infrared wavelengths by the leaves is directly related to the ability of plants to carry out their physiological activities properly such as photosynthesis taiz et al 2017 we observed in the late season for the 5th ratoon 337 dah fig 6 that savi values showed a high variability compared to the other periods as shown in fig 5 vertical bars this was likely due to the high occurrence of damping off caused by the association between the tall height of the plants over 4 m and high wind speed also caused by the fact that the crop might not be senescing equally so there could be in field variability in the savi due to different senescence rates due to good agreement between modeled geesebal and measured flux tower data overall the kc values fig 7 over growing seasons with high r2 and similar to allen et al 1998 and marin et al 2020 for the two ratoon seasons the accumulated eta presented great results following the measured eta by the ec and savi values overall all the wp values were very similar between the growing seasons because the similar yields 127 and 121 mg ha 1 irrigation precipitation and eto were very close between seasons these results were slightly lower than leal et al 2017 and greater than silva et al 2011 both conducted in brazil according to teixeira et al 2016 wp ranged from 2 8 to 6 0 kg m 3 in a study in the state of são paulo much lower than our findings in this research at least 40 lower likely because in most of brazil the sugarcane is not irrigated regarding the yield both ratoons resulted in values greater than the expected brazilian average for the next harvest 69 t ha 1 conab 2021 this approach using only orbital data through meteorological data from era5 land presented satisfactory results of kc and eta with great potential to be used in areas cultivated with sugarcane for monitoring and irrigation management although the average modeled eta values were greater than measured values for all the crop stages the values were quite similar except for the 5th ratoon at mid stage when modeled eta was about 30 greater than measured values fig 10 consequently kc values presented the same performance we notice that measured eta and kc presented greater variability than modeled values for both ratoon seasons and many outlier values even to eta regarding kc faoadj the values agreed to modeled and measured values for the initial stage for both ratoons when the eta is still low however as atmosphere demand increased this difference become higher kc faoadj reaching at mid stage 26 ec system and 23 modeled greater for the 4th ratoon respectively 56 ec system and 23 modeled respectively for the 5th ratoon there are many studies where irrigation ensured appropriate soil water content in the root zone and kc values decreased under high atmosphere demand i e high eto values marin and angelocci 2011 nassif et al 2014 marin et al 2016 2020 crop canopies limit water loss by partially or completely closing the stomata under high evaporative demand allowing the plants to maintain a favorable internal water balance even with optimum water content in the soil profile and high atmospheric demand for water boyer 1982 ciais et al 2005 franks 2013 vinya et al 2013 the variability of the measured eta flux tower in relation to modeled data geesebal was also observed in laipelt et al 2021 analyzing data from different biomes and land use accord to the authors the main challenge in developing a high resolution and large scale product is the endmember selection for calibration and the definition of its domain area the algorithm is highly sensitivity to the spatial domain which can significantly change et accuracy tang et al 2013 when the selected endmembers present discrepant values long et al 2011 both growing seasons showed some level of water stress after the crop reached the peak kc full cover phase when the irrigation required was very high due to the low volume of precipitation and high evapotranspiration rates over the period fig 11 the water stress was observed mainly during the final stages of growth for the 4th ratoon when the irrigation events are limited to increment the concentration of sugar in the stalks the effects of soil water stress on crop et reduces the kc value after the root zone depletion exceeds raw is high enough to limit evapotranspiration to less than potential values and the kc begins to decrease in proportion to the amount of water remaining in the root zone consequently decreasing et under rainfed conditions in low precipitation regions due to the severe water stress over the growing seasons the kc values is reduced reducing the eta and photosynthetic activity as a result increasing the yield loss as observed in gonçalves et al 2017 however the period of greatest susceptibility to water stress is the period of rapid crop development when the plants already have a high leaf area index and need a greater volume of water to meet their physiological needs pires et al 2008 gonçalves et at 2017 also sugarcane is relatively drought resistant needing a long period of water stress to reduce the stalk s yield ridesa 2015 the current version of geesebal uses landsat images and state of the art global reanalysis data to estimate et time series thus showing promising results even for field scale studies in data scarce areas the use of surface energy balance algorithms like geesebal and automated calibration algorithms like cimec in cloud computing environments such as gee can provide new opportunities to improve water management for irrigated crops at high spatial resolution for long term time series 5 conclusions this research was conducted in the largest sugarcane producing region of brazil using an open source sebal framework implemented within the google earth engine gee through the application programming interface api to estimate evapotranspiration and water balance in the root system of a growing sugarcane field considering two growing seasons 4th and 5th ratoons the modeled eb components using the geesebal model agreed well with the eddy covariance system values considering both satellite overpass time and modeled eta over growing seasons consequently kc values presented the same performance to measured and allen et al 1998 with modeled eta over the seasons it was possible to properly estimate the rs swb for the two ratoons identifying water stress for both seasons wp obtained values that were similar between the seasons with 10 and 9 7 kg m 3 for 4th and 5th respectively finally the et assessment showed the potential for geesebal to improve water use for irrigation management for sugarcane in brazil and mitigate the impacts of drought on stalk yields due to increasing water demand for food production and water supply given that geesebal does not require any ground measurement as input we anticipate that this tool may be useful for irrigated agriculture for field and regional scale studies on water and energy balances as well as for water resources management in missing climate data areas worldwide where this issue can be a

9257,irrigated agriculture requires the implementation of innovative tools to improve irrigation water management and accurate estimation of actual evapotranspiration eta such as remote sensing based methodology this study aimed to evaluate the irrigation management and estimating evapotranspiration through the geesebal a new tool for automated estimation of eta based on the surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal and a simplified version of the calibration using inverse modeling at extreme conditions cimec process for the endmembers selection implemented into the google earth engine gee environment geesebal has not been used yet in brazil for irrigation proposes and in this research it was applied to estimate eta using landsat images and era5 land as meteorological inputs in the largest sugarcane producing region of the world in brazil for two ratoon seasons by comparing daily eta with values obtained from eddy covariance ec data energy balance components using geesebal were consistent with the measured data and daily eta presenting rmse of 0 46 mm with r2 0 97 modeled eta and kc were similar for the two seasons although somewhat overestimated for the fifth ratoon when compared to the ec data mainly during high atmospheric demand crop mid stage still the kc values were similar to the standard values available in the literature and measured flux tower data for the two ratoons seasons with eta from geesebal it was possible to identify water stress over the growing seasons using the remote sensing based soil water balance which occurred mainly during the phase after the crop reached the peak kc full cover stage when the irrigation depth required was very high this analysis showed that geesebal has a significant potential for assessment of eta for irrigation monitoring and management even in missing climate data areas allowing important advances in water resources management for sugarcane and other irrigated crops at field or regional scales keywords water productivity landsat images era5 eddy covariance data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction rapid population growth has increasingly raised concerns in the global community about the role of agricultural production on the high demand for food and its impact on ecosystem sustainability according to prb population reference bureau 2020 the global population will reach almost 10 billion people in 2050 and food production is expected to increase by 35 56 to meet the demand dijk et al 2021 tropical climate countries with an extensive territorial area such as brazil are well known as important global food producers and exporters serving as a key supplier of food and other commodities such as fiber and biofuels however even in large countries agricultural lands are limited and water resources are increasingly scarce due to climate extremes although brazil is the world s largest sugarcane producer with an estimated production of more than 650 million tons in 8 6 million hectares most sugarcane fields are under rainfed conditions and the average yield is around 69 mg ha 1 conab 2021 to overcome low yields and increase efficiency in land use to boost food security irrigation practices have been adopted and the expansion rate of irrigation has grown in the country for irrigation management satellite images provide an excellent means for determining and mapping the spatial and temporal eta having great potential for improving irrigation management by providing eta estimations for large land surface areas using a minimal amount of ground data some recent studies have used remote sensing rs models successfully to monitor and improve irrigation management worldwide campos et al 2016 campos et al 2018 venancio et al 2019 foster et al 2019 the choice of an eta model depends on several factors including the type of application spatial and temporal resolutions meteorological inputs and the expected model advantages and limitations zhang et al 2016 rs based methodologies for estimating eta can be separated into two main groups 1 vegetation indexes based models where eta is estimated based on the basal crop coefficient as a function of the spectral reflectance values neale et al 1989 derived from vegetation indexes such as land surface evapotranspiration mod16 mu et al 2011 and 2 land surface temperature based models based on the energy balance approach these models can be one source when eta is estimated for soil and vegetation together as a single layer such as the well known sebal bastiaanssen et al 1998a and metric allen et al 2007 and two sources when et is estimated for soil and vegetation individually such as the two source energy balance tseb norman et al 1995 and alex disalex model anderson et al 1997 mecikalski et al 1999 norman et al 2003 yet these models use orbital imagery and ground based meteorological data and depending on the model can also use field data to estimate the components of the energy balance latent and sensible heat and soil heat flux and eta among several surface temperature ts based models sebal computes eta from satellite images and weather data using the surface energy balance and has been successfully applied worldwide across different climates and land cover conditions for water resources management presenting accurate results bastiaanssen et al 2005 bhattarai et al 2012 ruhoff et al 2012 tang et al 2013 wagle et al 2017 yang et al 2012 the main component of the algorithm is the internal process to estimate the near surface temperature gradient dt which is based on the selection of endmembers that represent the extremes of the wet cold and dry hot eta spectrum allen et al 2007 bastiaanssen et al 1998a while this was manually performed in early applications an algorithm based on surface temperature and normalized deviation vegetation index ndvi percentiles using the calibration inverse modeling at extreme conditions cimec has allowed the automatic selection of endmember candidates pixels allen et al 2013 this algorithm enabled the use of multiple images within a fully automated eta framework improving and facilitating the assessment of time series based on rs images bhattarai et al 2017 jaafar and ahmad 2019 considering the importance of estimating et worldwide for water resources management even in isolated areas where ground data is not available such as automatic weather station to provide meteorological data this might be a critical aspect that can be overcome using an open source sebal framework implemented within the google earth engine gee through application programming interface api named geesebal laipelt et al 2021 reflecting the importance of accurate eta estimates for irrigation monitoring and management through remote sensing even in areas where meteorological data is scarce the main goals of this study was to use an open source sebal framework implemented into google earth engine gee https earthengine google com through api known as geesebal to estimate temporal and spatial eta rs crop development crop coefficient kc and rs based soil water balance rs swb over two sugarcane growing seasons two years grown in the northwest state of são paulo brazil using current landsat 8 oli and landsat 7 etm images and the state of the art meteorological reanalysis from era5 land this approach has not been used in brazil yet for irrigation proposes in sugarcane and could be a great initiative to encourage the researcher community to use remote sensing technique with only orbital data without using meteorological inputs from terrestrial data to estimate the energy balance components and et collaborating with the advance in monitoring the crop water management additionally an evaluation of the performance results of the estimated energy balance eb components and eta using geesebal against field data obtained from the turbulent flux data eddy covariance was conducted 2 material and methods 2 1 study site this research was carried out in a commercial field of 24 ha in the western state of são paulo latitude 20 43 43 6 s longitude 51º16 30 3 o 360 m above

june 2018 with the highest data quality available tier 1 a total of 77 images were used cloud cover filters from the cfmask algorithm foga et al 2017 were used to identify clouds and shadows pixels for each image for global instantaneous meteorological inputs we used data from the era5 land reanalysis dataset hersbach et al 2020 munoz sabater et al 2021 at the hourly temporal resolution including air temperature at 2 m tair dew point temperature tdew and eastward and northward wind speed at 2 m at the time of landsat satellite overpass relative humidity rh was estimated following shuttleworth 2012 land surface temperature lst was adjusted to a common elevation datum tsdem using digital elevation data from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm considering an average lapse rate of 6 5 c km 1 and slope effects also were corrected according to jaafar and ahmad 2019 time series soil adjusted vegetation index known as savi vermote et al 2016 masek et al 2006 was used

inputs such as atmospherically corrected land surface reflectance and brightness temperature image collection from landsat 7 and 8 tier 1 was used to run geesebal also it was implemented cloud cover filters from the cfmask algorithm for each image foga et al 2017 to improve the image quality for global meteorological inputs we used data from the era5 land reanalysis dataset hersbach et al 2020 munoz sabater et al 2021 at hourly data including air temperature at 2 m tair dew point temperature tdew and eastward and northward wind speed at 10 m u at the time of landsat satellite overpass about the estimation of relative humidity rh we followed shuttleworth 2012 era5 land was selected mainly due to its global coverage and high spatial and temporal resolution when compared to other reanalysis data available in gee additionally we used incoming shortwave radiation data global radiation aggregated at daily time step furthermore the digital elevation model from srtm was also used for the ts correction 2 4 hot and cold endmembers automated calibration the automated statistical algorithm to select the hot and cold endmembers is based on a simplified version of the cimec algorithm used in metric allen et al 2013 subsequently evaluated by morton et al 2013 where percentiles of lst and normalized difference vegetation index ndvi values are used to select endmember candidates the cimec procedure is used to calibrate the dt function of eq 2 the cimec process is applied by inverting eq 6 for dt after solving eq 1 for h for the two extreme endpoint conditions in the image representing nearly full le cold endmember and nearly zero le hot endmember 6 h pc p dt r ah where q is air density kg m3 cp is air specific heat j kg k dt k is the temperature difference between two heights in a near surface blended layer and rah is the aerodynamic resistance to heat transport s m between two heights to solve the iteration process it is necessary to select hot and cold endmembers a linear relationship between ts and dt is assumed bastiaanssen et al 1998a eq 7 where a and b coefficients are empirically determined for each image 7 dt a bt the cold wet endmember candidates are selected in well vegetated areas where h is assumed to be zero and maximum le for a well watered agricultural field at the full cover canopy while for the hot dry endmember candidates the le is assumed to be zero and maximum h for an agricultural field having no green vegetation and dry soil surface layer usually the cold endmember is selected within a set of candidates with the highest ndvi 5 and the lowest ts 20 percentiles conversely the hot endmember is selected based on the lowest ndvi 10 and the highest ts 20 percentiles within geesebal these ranges are set as default standard however the user can easily select other percentile values as input parameters according to hydrometeorological conditions since the standard percentiles were calibrated and recommended for semiarid climates allen et al 2013 in this study we used the percentiles for cold pixels 5 ndvi 1 ts and hot pixels 1 ndvi 10 ts 2 5 field data of evapotranspiration eddy covariance measurements modeled energy balance components and eta24 h were compared to measured data provided by an eddy covariance flux tower installed in the field used to measure the micrometeorological variables and the energy balance components for estimating evapotranspiration covering the two ratoon seasons analyzed the ec consists of a three dimensional sonic anemometer and an infrared gas analyzer irgason campbell scientific logan utah usa positioned considering the prevailing wind direction operated by a data logger cr 3000 campbell scientific instruments utah usa to record raw high frequency data at 10 hz the micrometeorological variables measured above the canopy were net radiation cnr4 net radiometer kipp zonen delft netherlands and precipitation cs700 l hydrological services pty ltd sydney australia this equipment was positioned 5 m above the soil surface on the ground two soil heat flux plates were installed to measure the heat flow in the soil hfp01 l campbell scientific inc logan utah usa low frequency data were collected continuously at 5 second intervals averaging over 30 min the raw data from the ec system 10 hz were processed using eddypro advanced software licor 2020a and tovi software licor 2020b was used for data gap filling and flow partitioning every 30 min the flux data obtained over the two ratoons on average showed an energy balance closure on a daily scale of about 77 more details in bispo 2020 in some cases this results in a considerable amount of available energy rn g not being accounted for in the partitioning of latent and sensitive heat flux λe h which could cause significant discrepancies in the comparisons with the results from remote sensing the errors inherent in rn net radiation λe latent heat flux h sensitive heat flux and g heat flux in the soil are reported as 5 10 15 20 15 20 and 20 30 respectively according to foken 2008 vickers et al 2010 for this reason the bowen ratio values obtained with the flux tower data were used to adjust λe and h by forcing the closure following the procedure suggested by twine et al 2000 the λe values that represent the energy per unit area and per unit time were converted into evapotranspiration depth for each time interval and then 24 h accumulated resulting in actual daily evapotranspiration eta24 h also an instantaneous evaporative fraction ef was estimated considering the energy available used by the plants rn g divided by the surface energy balance directly relates to evapotranspiration λe to evaluate the effectiveness of geesebal the time series python function was used by selecting the pixels over the upwind footprint to estimate instantaneous modeled energy balance components and et24 h from geesebal and the modeled data were compared to ground data eddy flux tower daily crop coefficient kc was estimated using daily geesebal eta24 h satellite overpasses day considering the entire sugarcane area divided by eto from the weather station following eq 8 allen et al 1998 then kc values from satellite overpasses day were interpolated using gdd to estimate daily kc for the entire sugarcane season with the daily kc it was possible to estimate daily eta multiplying daily kc to eto crop water productivity wp was estimated by dividing the stalk yield kg per ha by the modeled accumulated eta for both growing seasons eq 9 8 kc eta eto where kc is the crop coefficient eta is the actual daily evapotranspiration mm eto is the reference evapotranspiration mm 9 wp yield et where wp is the crop water productivity kg m3 and et is the total evapotranspiration in m 3 per ha after getting geesebal eta24 h the remote sensing based soil water balance rs swb was calculated for each sugarcane season following allen et al 1998 considering the soil attributes data soil water depletion fraction p adjusted based on etc and effective rooting depth varying from 0 60 m crop initial stage to 0 80 m crop late stage 2 6 statistical analysis the energy balance components and the eta estimated by geesebal were compared with the data measured in the field through the ec flux tower to measure the accuracy of the model the r square rmse root mean squared error and bias indicators were applied according to eqs 10 and 11 respectively 10 rmse i 1 n y i ȳ i 2 n where rmse is the root mean squared error n is the sample size y is the observed variable ȳ is the modeled variable 11 bias i 0 n y i ȳ i n where n is the sample size y is the observed variable ȳ is the modeled variable 3 results overall the fourth and fifth growing seasons had similar average maximum and minimum temperatures equal to 30 9 3 8 c and 31 4 3 6 c for maximum temperature and 18 2 3 0 c and 17 9 3 7 c for minimum temperature respectively with temperature average equal to 24 6 c for both seasons 10 5 greater than the historical average for the region 23 3 c fig 3 accumulated precipitation was 988 mm and 974 mm in the 4th and 5th ratoon seasons respectively on average 21 lower than the average historical amount of 1242 mm for both ratoons precipitation was irregular over the growing seasons resulting in only 32 days and 31 days with precipitation over 10 mm respectively distributed from october to february rainy season 3 1 geesebal energy balance validation accord to fig 4 rn le h eta and ef presented r2 over 0 90 for all variables except g which was equal to 0 86 also except for g all the eb components presented low rmse and bias however despite the reasonable values of g 9 2 w m 2 and bias 14 9 w m 2 g values have little influence on eb because their values are considered very low less than 5 of rn in this study the table 2 summarize the statistical indices for all modeled geesebal and measured flux tower energy balance components and eta 3 2 crop development and crop evapotranspiration according to fig 5 the lowest savi values considering landsat 7 and landsat 8 images were 0 18 and 0 20 for the 4th and 5th ratoons respectively at the beginning of the respective crop seasons due to soil covered with sugarcane straw post harvest crop residues after harvest the savi values decrease to close to bare soil values around 0 12 the maximum savi value observed was 0 61 at 222 days after harvest dah for the 4th ratoon and 0 60 at 169 dah for the 5th ratoon in this study the savi values at harvest were 0 44 and 0 49 for the 4th and 5th ratoons respectively for both growing seasons savi values were similar and followed the development of the plants allowing the farmers to make decisions monitoring the crop stage such as the full cover stage at peak savi both growing seasons in february and the beginning of stalk maturity stage when savi start to decrease influenced by the reduction of green lai this occurred when savi reached about 0 50 by may and irrigation is cut off to promote the concentration of carbohydrates in the stalks and to improve the sugar and ethanol yields we observed that geesebal accurately modeled the eta values represented spatially and temporally as shown in fig 6 landsat 8 for each crop development stage and followed the savi values fig 4 therefore low savi values a few days after harvesting presented also low eta values due to the low leaf area of the plants however as savi increases eta also increased until it reached its maximum value when plants reached maximum vegetation cover savi greater than 55 at the beginning of the stalk maturation stage consequently due to a decrease in savi values the eta also decreased as shown in fig 6 dah4th 340 and dah5th 337 the kc values were modeled for each satellite overpass time using the eta modeled from the geesebal and the eto values from the meteorological station fig 7 with the kc values plotted over the gdd of the ratoon s cycles a kc gdd relationship is obtained with an r2 equal to 0 77 and 0 76 for the 4th and 5th growing seasons following acceptably the kc measured by the ec system we noticed for the 5th ratoon the modeled kc values were slightly overestimated compared to daily measured data mainly due to greater eta variability at the late stage the results from modeled kc values were extrapolated to the entire seasons based on the kc gdd relationship and daily evapotranspiration estimations daily eta were done and compared to measured data fig 8 about the 4th ratoon the data presented r2 equal to 0 89 rmse equal to 0 76 and less than 2 underestimating of eta compared to de flux tower regarding the 5th ratoon as modeled kc values were overestimated the results affected the modeled eta and on average overestimating the evapotranspiration by about 15 however there was a low rmse 0 62 and r2 equal to 0 88 maximum modeled daily kc values were 1 12 and 1 14 for the 4th and 5th ratoon seasons and on average 0 88 4th ratoon and 0 86 5th ratoon very close to the ec system for the 4th ratoon 0 86 and the 5th ratoon following the eta values the kc from ec system was about 20 lower kc 0 71 considering the two growing seasons as shown in fig 9 the eta presented great results following the measured eta by the ec and savi values and the modeled accumulated eta was 1266 mm and 1248 for the 4th and 5th ratoons respectively representing water productivity of 10 and 9 7 kg m 3 overall all the wp values were very similar between the growing seasons because the similar yields 127 and 121 mg ha 1 irrigation precipitation and eto were very close between seasons so an efficient way of increasing wp for sugarcane is through irrigation increasing water supply to avoid water stress and ensure high stalk yields in this study there were increments of 58 and 52 mg ha 1 greater than the national yield for the 4th and 5th ratoons respectively after applying 584 and 560 mm of irrigation i e an increase of 10 and 10 8 mg per mm of water applied for each growing season the eta and kc variability for each vegetative stage are summarized in fig 10 3 3 the remote sensing based soil water balance with modeled eta it was possible to estimate the rs swb for the two ratoon seasons fig 11 we observed water stress occurring during the development stage of the crop and the irrigation system was not able to apply the required water demand which resulted in water stress for the plants for the 4th total of 584 mm and 5th total of 560 mm growing seasons 4 discussion regarding the weather data for the two sugarcane growing seasons fig 3 it was favorable to the sugarcane development because sugarcane requires high temperatures and humidity for reaching high yields the minimum and maximum temperature must be between 20 c and 35 c marin et al 2014 vianna et al 2020 which has occurred for almost the entire period of cultivation sugarcane in brazil is purposefully planted in the dry season june and july to be harvested after one year during the dry season to increase the total recoverable sugar trs concentration in the stalk resulting in higher sugarcane quality and ability to be transformed into sugar or ethanol marin et al 2021 precipitation was poorly distributed during the evaluated period requiring supplementation via irrigation mainly during the regrowth stage right after harvest irrigation is required mainly after harvesting to ensure the regrowth of the ratoons and optimal stalk development until physiological maturity inman bamber et al 1994 being essential to maintain proper soil water content in the root zone for attaining high yields the eb components and eta values agreed very well with those measured by the ec system fig 4 despite the reasonable values of g its values have little influence on eb because their values are considered very low less than 5 of rn in this study according to mukaka 2012 the eb components values shown in this study indicated the accurate performance of geesebal with similar results also observed by yang et al 2018 and campos et al 2017 savi values fig 5 after reach the peak values full cover has its values decreased because of the maturation stage the savi values decrease until harvest due to the reduction in green leaf area index lai which is expected in this stage as shown in gonçalves et al 2017 and silva et al 2012 vegetation indices such as savi have been used to monitor irrigated sugarcane and other crops supporting water management as described in zhang et al 2015 venancio et al 2020 and campos et al 2017 geesebal accurately modeled the eta values spatially and over growing seasons fig 6 for each crop development stage as savi represents the vegetative vigor of the plants we expect that any changes in savi values will impact the eta values because the increase or decrease in absorbed radiation in the visible red and near infrared wavelengths by the leaves is directly related to the ability of plants to carry out their physiological activities properly such as photosynthesis taiz et al 2017 we observed in the late season for the 5th ratoon 337 dah fig 6 that savi values showed a high variability compared to the other periods as shown in fig 5 vertical bars this was likely due to the high occurrence of damping off caused by the association between the tall height of the plants over 4 m and high wind speed also caused by the fact that the crop might not be senescing equally so there could be in field variability in the savi due to different senescence rates due to good agreement between modeled geesebal and measured flux tower data overall the kc values fig 7 over growing seasons with high r2 and similar to allen et al 1998 and marin et al 2020 for the two ratoon seasons the accumulated eta presented great results following the measured eta by the ec and savi values overall all the wp values were very similar between the growing seasons because the similar yields 127 and 121 mg ha 1 irrigation precipitation and eto were very close between seasons these results were slightly lower than leal et al 2017 and greater than silva et al 2011 both conducted in brazil according to teixeira et al 2016 wp ranged from 2 8 to 6 0 kg m 3 in a study in the state of são paulo much lower than our findings in this research at least 40 lower likely because in most of brazil the sugarcane is not irrigated regarding the yield both ratoons resulted in values greater than the expected brazilian average for the next harvest 69 t ha 1 conab 2021 this approach using only orbital data through meteorological data from era5 land presented satisfactory results of kc and eta with great potential to be used in areas cultivated with sugarcane for monitoring and irrigation management although the average modeled eta values were greater than measured values for all the crop stages the values were quite similar except for the 5th ratoon at mid stage when modeled eta was about 30 greater than measured values fig 10 consequently kc values presented the same performance we notice that measured eta and kc presented greater variability than modeled values for both ratoon seasons and many outlier values even to eta regarding kc faoadj the values agreed to modeled and measured values for the initial stage for both ratoons when the eta is still low however as atmosphere demand increased this difference become higher kc faoadj reaching at mid stage 26 ec system and 23 modeled greater for the 4th ratoon respectively 56 ec system and 23 modeled respectively for the 5th ratoon there are many studies where irrigation ensured appropriate soil water content in the root zone and kc values decreased under high atmosphere demand i e high eto values marin and angelocci 2011 nassif et al 2014 marin et al 2016 2020 crop canopies limit water loss by partially or completely closing the stomata under high evaporative demand allowing the plants to maintain a favorable internal water balance even with optimum water content in the soil profile and high atmospheric demand for water boyer 1982 ciais et al 2005 franks 2013 vinya et al 2013 the variability of the measured eta flux tower in relation to modeled data geesebal was also observed in laipelt et al 2021 analyzing data from different biomes and land use accord to the authors the main challenge in developing a high resolution and large scale product is the endmember selection for calibration and the definition of its domain area the algorithm is highly sensitivity to the spatial domain which can significantly change et accuracy tang et al 2013 when the selected endmembers present discrepant values long et al 2011 both growing seasons showed some level of water stress after the crop reached the peak kc full cover phase when the irrigation required was very high due to the low volume of precipitation and high evapotranspiration rates over the period fig 11 the water stress was observed mainly during the final stages of growth for the 4th ratoon when the irrigation events are limited to increment the concentration of sugar in the stalks the effects of soil water stress on crop et reduces the kc value after the root zone depletion exceeds raw is high enough to limit evapotranspiration to less than potential values and the kc begins to decrease in proportion to the amount of water remaining in the root zone consequently decreasing et under rainfed conditions in low precipitation regions due to the severe water stress over the growing seasons the kc values is reduced reducing the eta and photosynthetic activity as a result increasing the yield loss as observed in gonçalves et al 2017 however the period of greatest susceptibility to water stress is the period of rapid crop development when the plants already have a high leaf area index and need a greater volume of water to meet their physiological needs pires et al 2008 gonçalves et at 2017 also sugarcane is relatively drought resistant needing a long period of water stress to reduce the stalk s yield ridesa 2015 the current version of geesebal uses landsat images and state of the art global reanalysis data to estimate et time series thus showing promising results even for field scale studies in data scarce areas the use of surface energy balance algorithms like geesebal and automated calibration algorithms like cimec in cloud computing environments such as gee can provide new opportunities to improve water management for irrigated crops at high spatial resolution for long term time series 5 conclusions this research was conducted in the largest sugarcane producing region of brazil using an open source sebal framework implemented within the google earth engine gee through the application programming interface api to estimate evapotranspiration and water balance in the root system of a growing sugarcane field considering two growing seasons 4th and 5th ratoons the modeled eb components using the geesebal model agreed well with the eddy covariance system values considering both satellite overpass time and modeled eta over growing seasons consequently kc values presented the same performance to measured and allen et al 1998 with modeled eta over the seasons it was possible to properly estimate the rs swb for the two ratoons identifying water stress for both seasons wp obtained values that were similar between the seasons with 10 and 9 7 kg m 3 for 4th and 5th respectively finally the et assessment showed the potential for geesebal to improve water use for irrigation management for sugarcane in brazil and mitigate the impacts of drought on stalk yields due to increasing water demand for food production and water supply given that geesebal does not require any ground measurement as input we anticipate that this tool may be useful for irrigated agriculture for field and regional scale studies on water and energy balances as well as for water resources management in missing climate data areas worldwide where this issue can be a

9258,in arid and semi arid irrigation areas with shallow water tables and fragmented arrangement of croplands and abandoned lands dry drainage could be an optional management practice mitigating soil salinization a dry drainage system lets non irrigated abandoned lands serve as evaporative salt sinks receiving water and salt fluxes from adjacent irrigated croplands therefore this research takes a typical dry drainage unit in the hetao irrigation district one abandoned land and its adjacent croplands as an example to directly reveal the field scale water and salt migration between abandoned lands and adjacent croplands it was found that during the growing season the water input i e field irrigation and precipitation raised the water table of the croplands and drove water and salt migration from croplands to the abandoned lands however the evapotranspiration in the croplands was also larger than that in the abandoned lands thus during the intervals of irrigation the phreatic evaporation periods in some circumstances evapotranspiration could drive water and salt flux from the abandoned lands to the croplands which would influence the groundwater salinity of the croplands therefore it is recommended to plant halophytes on the abandoned lands to enhance its evapotranspiration and hinder the water and salt flux from the abandoned lands to the croplands during intervals of irrigation this management practice could help form more effective dry drainage systems between abandoned lands and adjacent croplands and help better control the root zone salinity of the croplands keywords dry drainage farmland fallow area salinity groundwater lateral flow data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction soil salinization threatens more than 1 5 of the irrigated areas in the world lekakis and antonopoulos 2015 mao et al 2020 a traditional way to mitigate secondary soil salinization was the artificial drainage the excess salt was leached from the root zone and drained through the artificial drainage systems wang et al 2019a wu et al 2009 however the construction and long term maintenance cost of an artificial drainage system and the related downstream water quality deterioration problems hinder the implementation of artificial drainage systems abedi koupai et al 2020 thus the dry drainage systems arose as an alternative in 1992 growing and wyseure 1992 a dry drainage system is consisted of a non irrigated fallow area and an irrigated cropland the salt in the cropland soil leaches with excess irrigation water into groundwater moves towards the fallow area through lateral groundwater flow and accumulates in the topsoil of the fallow area via evapotranspiration konukcu et al 2006 in the past three decades dry drainage has been researched and adopted by producers world widely in the indus basin in pakistan konukcu 2006 konukcu et al 2006 in the san joaquin valley of california in the usa khouri 1998 in the hetao irrigation district in china wang et al 2019a 2020a 2019b wu et al 2009 in iran abedi koupai et al 2020 akram et al 2008 ansari et al 2019 and in australia greenwood et al 1994 1992 the effectiveness of dry drainage systems and its influential factors have been studied ever since their emergence it was proposed that a dry drainage system could be effective if the water removed from the fallow area via evapotranspiration could exceed the recharge of the fallow area by the lateral flow from the irrigated cropland wang et al 2019a more specifically when designing or evaluating a dry drainage system the width ratio of cropland to fallow area and the limiting groundwater depth need to be determined and the long term impact of salt accumulation on the fallow area need to be considered akram et al 2008 konukcu 2006 soltani et al 2018 sotoodehnia et al 2015 the factors influencing the effectiveness of dry drainage systems include the soil properties the crop types the climatic conditions and the costs and benefits khouri 1998 a mainstream model to simulate the water and salt migration in a dry drainage system and evaluate its effectiveness was proposed by konukcu et al 2006 in this model the irrigated cropland leaches salt from its root zone whereas the fallow area receives saline groundwater from the irrigated cropland and accumulates salt in its soil profile via evaporation however the model has several critical assumptions 1 during the growing season evaporation should not exceed field irrigation plus precipitation for croplands 2 capillary rise could be neglected in croplands during the growing season 3 the deep percolation from the cropland is assumed to move through groundwater and eventually evaporate from the fallow area and 4 during the fallow period of the irrigated cropland it is treated as a fallow area via model simulation konukcu et al 2006 suggested that when the water table was around 1 5 m depth and the irrigated cropland and its sink area were of roughly equal area a dry drainage system could be effective after the model developed by konukcu et al 2006 both experimental observation and model simulation of dry drainage systems have further advanced for example with a loamy soil lysimeter ansari et al 2019 observed the accumulation ratio of regular ions in the topsoil of the fallow area they illustrated that sodium potassium calcium nitrate and chloride accumulated in the topsoil with an accumulation ratio of 1 67 1 20 1 81 2 58 and 1 20 respectively whereas magnesium accumulated in the deep layers and its accumulation ratio in the topsoil was 0 90 and the transport processes of the ions in their dry drainage system were quantified with a hydrus 2d model abedi koupai et al 2020 the hetao irrigation district hid is one of the largest irrigation areas in china where irrigation and drainage systems and water and salt migration processes have been intensely investigated to improve crop production gao et al 2014 xu et al 2010 as a novel drainage system to mitigate secondary salinization dry drainage has been investigated in the hid for decades for instance wu et al 2009 obtained the cropped area and the non cropped area in the hid by calculating the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and cutting by a threshold and they obtained the salt affected area in the hid by maximum likelihood supervised classification then the salt removed from the croplands was estimated by a water and salt balance model the major assumption of the model was that the groundwater always flowed from the irrigated croplands to the non irrigated abandoned area during the growing season the residual salt in the system was estimated by the difference between the inlet salt via irrigation and the outlet salt via artificial drainage the results showed that about 72 of the inlet salt remained in the system however the actual salt affected irrigated area was on average only 6 6 of the total irrigated area in the hid from 1972 to 2004 thus they believed that the dry drainage must have played a very important role in controlling the soil salinity of the irrigated areas to further prove the effectiveness of the dry drainage systems in the hid they monitored the inlet irrigation water the discharge of the artificial drainage canals the groundwater level and ec and soil water content for one year in a study area of 29 km2 in the central hid based on the monitored data they conducted water and salt balance calculation for the 29 km2 study area following the same way as they did for the hid they concluded that the water and salt drained by the dry drainage were 9 6 and 16 times respectively larger than that of the artificial drainage similar to the field monitoring and water and salt balance calculation by wu et al 2009 wang et al 2019a conducted a five year field monitoring from 2007 to 2011 in the yonglian experimental station and calculated the water and salt balance of the monitored 29 km2 study area it was found that of all the excess water and salt migrated from the croplands to the fallow areas the artificial drainage systems only took up about 18 9 of the water and 11 5 of the salt and the rest was via the dry drainage systems researchers have also established water and salt balance models of a cropland 0 037 km2 abandoned land 0 043 km2 salt lake 0 512 km2 dry drainage system located at the junction of the jiefangzha subdistrict and the yongji subdistrict of the hid wang et al 2020a 2019b they estimated the effect of groundwater depth on soil salinity and revealed that the groundwater depth of the croplands should be controlled in the range of 1 7 2 3 m to form an effective dry drainage system however in the hid the croplands the abandoned lands and the salt lakes take up 5740 km2 2090 km2 and 130 km2 respectively wang et al 2020a 2019b thus only very limited dry drainage systems are the cropland abandoned land salt lake dry drainage systems most of the dry drainage systems are consisted of fragmented arranged adjacent croplands and abandoned areas which are far from salt lakes more specifically in the hid the croplands and abandoned areas are not intentionally designed but rather arranged by the relative land conditions among the adjacent fields the relatively high areas with lower salinity were cultivated and cropped while the relatively low areas with higher salinity were abandoned resulting in very fragmented arrangement of croplands and abandoned areas thus the ideal dry drainage condition assuming unidirectional lateral flow from croplands to abandoned areas may not always hold and due to the very shallow water table of the hid the ideal dry drainage condition assuming unidirectional salt movement from the root zone of the croplands to groundwater and then to the topsoil of the abandoned areas may not always hold as well therefore for an estimation of the relative contributions of the artificial drainage and dry drainage systems at large scales 30 km2 and above the water and salt balance calculation of wu et al 2009 and wang et al 2019a are very helpful however the actual contribution of the dry drainage systems at field scale i e the actual water and salt flux from irrigated croplands to adjacent non irrigated abandoned areas still waits to be revealed therefore it is in need to 1 reveal whether the typical dry drainage systems consisted of fragmented arranged croplands and adjacent abandoned lands in the hid are truly effective in salinity control at field scale or not and 2 provide recommendations on developing more effective dry drainage systems in the hid based on their current condition thus we directly monitored the soil profiles and groundwater of a typical dry drainage unit in the hid which consisted of one abandoned land and its adjacent croplands our objectives are 1 to reveal the water and salt balance and dynamics of the croplands and the abandoned land 2 to discover the actual water and salt flux between the croplands and the abandoned land and 3 to provide targeted recommendations for cropland salinity control 2 methods 2 1 experimental setup the field monitoring was conducted in the guangming no 2 village 40 55 40 73 n 107 9 53 07 e in the hid fig 1a located in arid and semi arid area the hid has an annual precipitation of 120 220 mm an annual evaporation of 2000 mm and an annual average temperature of 7 c wang et al 2022a the study site had one abandoned land and three croplands named the north cropland 2 ncl2 the north cropland 1 ncl1 the abandoned land al and the east cropland ecl from the north to the east fig 1c in 2018 ncl2 was planted with squash and ncl1 and ecl were planted with sunflower fig 2 while in 2019 all the three croplands were planted with sunflower the growth stages of sunflower and squash fig 3 are observed and verified by local studies dai et al 2011 du et al 2014 jian et al 2019 wang et al 2021 the meteorological data was obtained from the vantage pro 2 weather station located at the shahaoqu experimental station about 1 km from the study site with the measured meteorological data the reference evapotranspiration eto fig 2 was obtained by the penman monteith equation following fao 56 allen et al 1998 the croplands were flood irrigated with water diverted from the yellow river with a salinity of 0 6 g l chang 2019 chen et al 2005 nachshon 2018 the irrigation schedule and the total volume of each irrigation event were recorded fig 4 the l shaped study site with a total length and width of 154 m and 128 m respectively was equipped with a total of 8 vertical groundwater monitoring wells the circles in fig 1c and allocated with 4 soil sampling sites the triangles in fig 1c the wells were arranged to monitor groundwater flow in two perpendicular directions the wells n1 n2 n3 k2 e1 and k1 were arranged to monitor groundwater and salt flow from the north to the south while the wells e3 e2 e1 k2 and k1 were arranged to monitor groundwater and salt flow from the east to the west each groundwater monitoring well was supported by a pvc tube open at the bottom with a diameter of 11 cm and a length of 8 m the underground part was perforated and wrapped with screen to prevent sediment from entering the pvc tube each groundwater monitoring well was equipped with a hydros 21 auto logging sensor meter group inc usa monitoring the groundwater

water content vwc and soil electrical conductivity ec were automatically monitored hourly by hydra probe sensors stevens water monitoring systems inc portland oregon united states of america equipped at 20 40 60 100 and 140 cm depth besides the hourly automatic soil profile monitoring soil samples were taken weekly and right before and after each irrigation event for the vwc and ec1 5 the ec of the 1 5 soil to water extract lab measurement the soil samples were taken by 7 layers 0 20 cm 20 40 cm 40 60 cm 60 80 cm 80 100 cm 100 120 cm and 120 140 cm the measured soil ec1 5 ms cm was converted to soil salinity ss g kg by ss 3 480 ec 1 5 0 236 r 2 0 993 wang et al 2020b different from the weekly soil samples for the vwc and the ec1 5 lab measurement the soil physical properties listed in table 1 such as the soil bulk density ρ b and the saturated water content θ s are relatively stable thus the soil samples for these relatively stable physical properties were taken once and for all when the water table depth was more than 140 cm and the samples were taken by 5 layers 0 20 cm 20 40 cm 40 60 cm 60 100 cm and 100 140 cm table 1 the soil particle distribution and texture were determined by a laser particle size analyzer mastersizer 2000 malvern instruments ltd united kingdom the soil bulk density ρ b was measured by oven drying the soil hydraulic parameters i e the residual water content θ r the saturated water content θ s the inverse of the air entry value α the pore size distribution index n and the saturated hydraulic conductivity k s were inversely solved with hydrus 1d the calibration data was the daily average vwc of each soil layer in the 2018 growing season and the validation data was the daily average vwc of each soil layer in the 2019 growing season with these soil hydraulic parameters the field capacity θ fc the vwc at 0 33 bar i e 336 5 cm pressure head was calculated with the van genuchten equation van genuchten 1980 1 θ θ r θ s θ r 1 α h n m where m 1 1 n h 336 5 cm and the value of all the other parameters i e θ r θ s α and n are listed in table 1 2 2 water balance analysis since the studied croplands were adjacent to other croplands and the studied abandoned land was a part of a large abandoned land the boundaries of the l shaped study site were assumed to be no flux boundaries in this shallow water table area the water table depth varied between 50 and 150 cm during about 70 of the growing season therefore the 0 50 cm vadose zone was chosen to calculate the water balance instead of the commonly chosen 0 100 cm root zone for the croplands the soil water balance equation can be simplified to 2 w p i g et r where δw is the total change of the soil water storage of the 0 50 cm soil layer during the growing season mm p is the growing season total precipitation mm l is the growing season total field irrigation mm g is the growing season total capillary rise mm et is the growing season total evapotranspiration mm and r is the growing season total deep percolation mm for the non irrigated abandoned land the soil water balance equation can be further simplified to 3 w p g et r where et is the growing season total evapotranspiration mostly soil evaporation mm the vertical water flux through the 50 cm depth q v cm d positive for upward and negative for downward was calculated daily by the darcy s law under unsaturated conditions tindall et al 1999 4 s e θ θ r θ s θ r 5 ψ m 1 α se 1 m 1 1 n 6 k θ k s s e 0 5 1 1 s e 1 m m 2 7 q v k θ 1 ψ m z 8 ψ m z ψ m z ψ m 60 ψ m 40 60 40 9 g 10 q v 0 q v 10 r 10 q v 0 q v where θ θ r and θ s are the daily average residual and saturated volumetric water content at 50 cm respectively and are approximated by the average of θ θ r and θ s at 40 and 60 cm depth respectively s e is called the effective saturation ψ m is the matric potential cm α is the inverse of the air entry value n is the pore size distribution index and m 1 1 n k θ is the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity cm d at 50 cm depth and its calculation is provided by eq 6 van genuchten 1980 eq 8 shows how to use the ψ m at 60 and 40 cm depth i e ψ m60 and ψ m40 to obtain the approximation of ψ m z the capillary rise g mm and the deep percolation r mm were the summation of the upward and downward water flux through the 50 cm depth and were converted from centimeter to millimeter by a factor of 10 i e eq 9 and eq 10 respectively the et of each cropland and the abandoned land was adjusted from the eto by multiplying the crop coefficient k c and the water stress coefficient k s following fao 56 allen et al 1998 11 et et o k c k s 12 k s 1 0 58 0 04 et c θ i θ wp θ fc θ wp θ i θ j 1 θ i θ j where θ fc is the vwc at field capacity cm3 cm3 listed in table 1 θ wp is the vwc at wilting point which can be roughly estimated by 2θ r cm3 cm3 θ j is the threshold vwc below which transpiration is reduced due to water stress cm3 cm3 and its calculation is provided by fao 56 allen et al 1998 the locally adjusted k c for different stages of sunflower and squash are shown in fig 3 whereas the k c for the abandoned land was estimated by the kc value during the initial period kc ini as suggested by the fao 56 allen et al 1998 for bare soil the kc ini of squash 0 3 was much less than the fao 56 tabulated value 0 5 because the wetting interval of the squash field during the initial stage nfl2 in 2018 fig 4 was more than 20 days the kc value for full grown crops kc mid of both sunflower 1 01 and squash 0 872 were lower than the fao 56 tabulated value 1 15 for sunflower and 0 95 for squash because the wind speed was mostly 0 1 0 3 m s much less than the standard u 2 2 m s and the minimum relative humidity rhmin was mostly 60 70 significantly more than the standard rhmin 45 during the mid season fig 2 although the hid located in the arid and semi arid region the irrigation complemented the precipitation shortage and both the mean relative humidity rhmean and rhmin are high during the growing season fig 2 the squash was not harvested until september 28th when all the leaves were dead thus the kc value at the end of the late season stage kc end of squash can be estimated by the kc value suggested by the fao 56 for bare soil besides the above analyzed vertical water migration terms for shallow water table areas the adjacent fields are hydrologically connected via lateral groundwater flow and the capillary rise g was largely dependent on the water table depth van hoorn and van alphen 1994 therefore the lateral groundwater flow l mm was also calculated for the abandoned land by 13 l μ δ h where µ 0 033 is the specific yield measured by the local hydrological bureau wang et al 2019a and δh is the sum of the water table elevation differences in the abandoned land before and after each irrigation mm 2 3 dynamics of soil water and groundwater and their salinities the daily average of the automatically monitored hourly soil vwc and ec1 5 and the weekly lab measured soil vwc and ec1 5 were integrated and 2d interpolated to obtain the soil water and salt dynamics during the two whole growing seasons the 8 groundwater monitoring wells were arranged in a way that water table elevation in the north south direction could be obtained at 6 different positions and the water table elevation in the east west direction could be obtained at 5 different positions fig 1c thus the daily average of the automatically monitored hourly water table elevation and the groundwater ec at the 8 groundwater monitoring wells were 2d interpolated to obtain the groundwater flow field and the groundwater ec spatial distribution of the l shaped study site on each day respectively all of the 2d interpolations including the spatial and temporal interpolation of soil vwc and ec1 5 and the spatial interpolation of groundwater elevation and ec in two directions were performed by surfer 13 the soil salt accumulation or desalinization was obtained by subtracting the soil salt storage after irrigation from that before irrigation and the soil salt storage w kg m2 was obtained by the summation of the soil salt in each soil layer 14 w 0 01 ss ρ b d where ss is the soil salinity g kg ρ b is the soil bulk density g cm3 of each soil layer d is the depth of each soil layer and 0 01 is the conversion factor 2 4 lateral water and salt fluxes the lateral water flux between adjacent fields q l cm d was obtained by darcy s law 15 q l k s h l where k s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity cm d h is the groundwater elevation difference cm and l is the horizontal distance between the two groundwater monitoring wells cm and the associated lateral salt flux between adjacent fields q l c g mg d 1 cm 2 was the product of the water flux between the lands q l cm d and the groundwater salinity c g g l at the source monitoring well 3 results and discussion 3 1 water balance and dynamics during the growing season the water balance was obtained for the croplands and the abandoned land during both the 2018 and 2019 growing seasons may 15th to september 15th fig 5 the precipitation fig 2 and field irrigation fig 4 were measured the evapotranspiration was calculated by eq 11 for the croplands and the abandoned land the deep percolation and capillary rise were obtained for the 0 50 cm soil layer by eq 9 and eq 10 respectively and the lateral groundwater flow from the croplands to the abandoned land was obtained by eq 13 overall at the study site during the growing season the precipitation was 78 12 mm the field irrigation evapotranspiration deep percolation and capillary rise in the croplands were 429 60 mm 278 18 mm 248 36 mm and 201 26 mm respectively and the evapotranspiration deep percolation and capillary rise of the abandoned land and the lateral groundwater flow into the abandoned land were 129 4 mm 82 28 mm 263 7 mm and 105 9 mm respectively overall in the 2018 growing season there was more precipitation higher temperature and larger eto fig 2 and more irrigation in the croplands fig 4 than those in the 2019 growing season this led to larger deep percolation 263 24 mm vs 232 38 mm and larger evapotranspiration 286 23 mm vs 270 0 mm and capillary rise 211 3 mm vs 191 34 mm in the croplands in the 2018 growing season whereas the capillary rise and the evapotranspiration mostly evaporation from the abandoned land did not change much the relatively stable capillary rise and evaporation in the abandoned area might be due to a relatively stable shallow water table depth range during both growing seasons note that in 2019 the squash in ncl2 was replaced by sunflower fig 5 and the k c curve changed accordingly fig 3 the water dynamics in the 0 140 cm soil profiles were obtained for the croplands and the abandoned land during both the 2018 and 2019 growing seasons may 1st to september 15th fig 6 the saturated soil water content and the field capacity of each soil layer in each land are tabulated in table 1 in general the 100 140 cm soil layer was saturated 0 469 0 533 cm3 cm3 as most of the time it was under the water table the 60 100 cm soil layer was moist mostly 0 390 0 500 cm3 cm3 as the water table fluctuated in this range whereas the moisture of the 0 40 cm soil layer dramatically fluctuated between 0 218 and 0 480 cm3 cm3 as it was affected by the water input precipitation field irrigation evapotranspiration deep percolation and capillary rise fig 6 the vwc around 40 cm in the ecl reached the lowest after august 30th 2018 due to the insufficient irrigation amount in the ecl during the fourth irrigation fig 4 the al received lateral groundwater flow from the adjacent croplands i e ncl1 and ecl during the growing season fig 5a and b resulting in the high vwc 0 358 0 478 cm3 cm3 in the 60 140 cm layer whereas the vwc in the 0 40 cm 0 248 0 450 cm3 cm3 was mainly the results of the precipitation and capillary rise the ncl2 was not adjacent to the al thus its soil moisture and soil salinity dynamics had little influence on those of the al taking the al and the ncl1 in the 2018 growing season as an example the soil water dynamics after each irrigation between the abandoned land and its adjacent cropland was analyzed fig 6a in 2018 the ncl1 maintained high soil moisture 0 430 cm3 cm3 before the first irrigation probably thanks to the frozen period after the autumn irrigation in 2017 wang et al 2022b thus receiving a small amount of first irrigation 65 mm ncl1 leached quickly by gravity this resulted in a sharp rise in the water table elevation by 1246 mm on may 18th and the soil layer remained moist 0 470 0 485 cm3 cm3 below the 40 cm depth then it was the period dominated by the evapotranspiration the topsoil became drier and the drying front reached 60 cm depth and the water table elevation declined by 1323 mm on june 19th it was the time of the second irrigation 144 mm with more water this time more irrigation water was stored in the soil profile and less was leached to the groundwater this resulted in a soil vwc 0 410 0 470 cm3 cm3 similar to that after the first irrigation but the water table elevation increase 825 mm was less than that after the first irrigation again after a period of evapotranspiration domination the water table elevation declined by 780 mm then the third irrigation 139 mm was carried out on july 15th with less amount of irrigation water than the second irrigation this resulted in lower vwc 0 395 0 437 cm3 cm3 in the 0 60 cm layer and less water table elevation increase 460 mm than those after the previous two irrigations after a long period of evapotranspiration domination the drying front reached 110 cm depth and the water table depth reached 2096 mm the last irrigation of a small amount 130 mm increased soil moisture but did not percolate to groundwater much overall the vwc profile of the ncl1 showed high consistency with its water table elevation variation during the growing season whereas the abandoned land al had different vwc dynamics from that of the ncl1 because the al received no irrigation but received water from precipitation and lateral groundwater flow from adjacent croplands after their irrigation in addition the evapotranspiration 133 mm mainly evaporation was much less than that of the croplands 253 304 mm fig 5 therefore the wetting front in the soil moisture profile of the al after irrigations was not as high as that of the ncl1 while the drying front due to the evapotranspiration was not as deep as that of the ncl1 during the 2019 growing season fig 6b the general vwc dynamic patterns of both the ncl1 and the al were similar to those during the 2018 growing season fig 6a except that the vwc profile of the ncl1 showed continuous deepening drying front after its third irrigation in the 2019 growing season fig 6b because it received only three irrigations in the 2019 growing season fig 4 and the vwc profile of the al showed corresponding dynamics 3 2 soil salt dynamics during the growing season the soil salinity had been well controlled during the growing seasons for the croplands fig 7 following dpird 2021 for loams ec1 5 0 20 ms cm is non saline 0 20 ms cm ec1 5 0 40 ms cm is slightly saline 0 40 ms cm ec1 5 0 80 ms cm is moderately saline and 0 80 ms cm ec1 5 1 60 ms cm is highly saline for most of the time during both growing seasons the croplands root zone 0 80 cm salinity kept in the range of non saline blue regions and slightly saline green and yellow regions after each irrigation the croplands did desalt from the top while the abandoned land accumulated salt on the top during the 2018 growing season fig 7a though this was not clear during the 2019 growing season due to the missing topsoil data fig 7b the variation of the 0 50 cm vadose zone soil salt storage before and after the third irrigation in 2018 was analyzed as an example to demonstrate the soil salt variation corresponding to irrigation fig 8 before the third irrigation the 0 50 cm soil salt storage of the ncl2 ncl1 and ecl were 0 543 kg m2 0 856 kg m2 and 0 639 kg m2 respectively whereas the 0 50 cm soil salt storage of the al was 5 43 kg m2 about 10 times higher than that of the croplands after the third irrigation the soil salt storage of the ncl2 ncl1 and ecl were 0 403 kg m2 0 623 kg m2 and 0 523 kg m2 and the desalination rate were 25 78 27 30 and 18 12 respectively the soil salt of the croplands was leached by the irrigation and migrated to the abandoned land via lateral groundwater flow in the abandoned land salt accumulated in the topsoil due to evaporation and the accumulation rate of the 0 50 cm soil salt storage was 9 44 of its background value 5 43 kg m2 within five days there existed a relatively low ec region in each soil profile fig 7 below the lower limit of this region the soil salinity was dominated by the fluctuation of the water table i e the longer waterlogging time the higher the soil salinity whereas above the lower limit of this region the soil salinity was the balance of leaching and evapotranspiration interestingly the relatively low salinity region of the abandoned land 20 10 cm was generally shallower than those of the croplands 20 10 cm of ncl2 90 10 cm of ncl1 and 40 10 cm of ecl in the 2018 growing season fig 7a whereas it 90 10 cm was deeper than ncl2 60 10 cm ncl1 40 10 cm and ecl 40 10 cm in the 2019 growing season fig 7b the main reason was that there was no irrigation on the abandoned area until an accident irrigation during the autumn irrigation in 2018 after the 2018 growing season before that accident irrigation the only leaching water was precipitation and the lateral flow from the croplands continuously provided water for evapotranspiration in the abandoned land year after year the overall soil salinity of the abandoned land was one magnitude larger than that of the croplands fig 7a the salt accumulated in the topsoil of the abandoned land reduced the rate of water vapor flux thus the stationary evaporation front i e the evaporation front when water vapor flux balances capillary rise flux should be shallower than those of the croplands and due to the salt leaching of the abandoned land by that accident irrigation the soil salt storage in the 30 140 cm of the abandoned area dropped 10 45 in 2019 fig 7b though the topsoil salinity data was missing in 2019 and the relatively low salinity region also deepened 3 3 lateral water and salt flux during the growing season for an ideal dry drainage system it was usually assumed that the irrigation water leached from the croplands and migrated to the abandoned lands via lateral groundwater flow from where it evaporated konukcu et al 2006 wu et al 2009 along this way the salt migrated from the cropland root zone to the abandoned land where it accumulated in the topsoil for example the groundwater always flowed from the ecl to the al though before irrigation flowed slowly 0 0021 cm d fig 9a and after irrigation on may 16th flowed quickly 0 12 cm d fig 9b the fast flow subsided quickly on may 31st fig 9c the flow restored to the state before the irrigation 0 005 cm d which lasted until the second irrigation on june 19th fig 9d and the flux between the ncl1 and the al in 2019 generally followed the same pattern fig 10d however the monitored water table elevation and calculated water and salt flux showed that this ideal assumption may not always hold in actual dry drainage systems taking the ncl1 and the al in the 2018 growing season for example fig 10a before irrigation water flowed slowly 0 0014 cm d from the al to the ncl1 after the ncl1 received an irrigation on may 18th the water table elevation of the ncl1 rose and water flowed quickly 0 033 cm d from the ncl1 to the al the lateral groundwater flow from the farmlands to the al continued until the water table elevation of the al rose to the same level as that of the ncl1 on may 26th fig 10b then the water table was dropping due to capillary rise due to the large crop transpiration in the croplands and the salt clogged soil pore spaces in the abandoned lands the evapotranspiration in the ncl1 was larger than that of the al 304 mm vs 133 mm during the 2018 growing season fig 5a causing larger phreatic evaporation i e the direct evaporation from the groundwater brunner et al 2008 in the ncl1 thus the groundwater flowed slowly 0 003 cm d from the al to the ncl1 this happened most of the time in the 2018 growing season between the ncl1 and the al and the salt migrated with water fig 10a the surprisingly large fluxes from the al to the ncl1 during both growing seasons fig 10a and d were due to the irrigation on the ecl from the west side which raised the water table of the al ahead of the ncl1 this example showed that the growing season of the croplands should be divided into several irrigation periods and phreatic evaporation periods by the direction of the vertical flux fig 10c and f during the irrigation periods the croplands should be calculated as the irrigated area proposed by konukcu et al 2006 whereas during the phreatic evaporation periods the croplands should be calculated as the fallow area proposed by konukcu et al 2006 the lateral groundwater flow between the croplands and the abandoned land would influence the groundwater salinity of the croplands fig 11 before the first irrigation the al had an about 17 1 ds m groundwater salinity and the croplands had an about 2 64 ds m groundwater salinity fig 11a as the result of receiving the thawed soil water of different salinities wang et al 2022b after the first irrigation the croplands groundwater was diluted by the deep percolation of the mixture of soil water and irrigated water and its salinity dropped fig 11b the al groundwater was diluted by the lateral groundwater coming from the croplands and its salinity was continuously decreasing until the end of the growing season fig 11a f however the croplands groundwater salinity gradually increased due to occasionally receiving lateral groundwater coming from the al fig 11c f 4 conclusions in arid and semiarid irrigation areas with fragmented croplands and abandoned lands and shallow water tables like the hetao irrigation district the dry drainage systems were not designed intentionally but rather formed by the relative elevation and soil salinity of the adjacent fields in this case the ideal dry drainage concept that assumes net leaching in croplands net evapotranspiration in fallow areas and unidirectional water and salt flux from the croplands to the fallow areas may not always hold our two year field monitoring demonstrated that the lower part of the cropland root zone suffered from waterlogging of saline groundwater while besides the leaching by irrigation and precipitation the upper part of the cropland root zone suffered from salt accumulation during intervals in irrigation the phreatic evaporation periods due to its large evapotranspiration the lateral water and salt flux was flowing from the irrigated croplands to the abandoned land within several days after an irrigation event the irrigation period whereas the lateral water and salt flux direction could be reversed during the phreatic evaporation periods due to larger evapotranspiration in croplands than that in the abandoned land the abandoned land groundwater salinity was continuously diluted during the growing season whereas the occasional lateral groundwater flow from the abandoned land to the croplands would gradually increase the groundwater salinity of the croplands therefore planting halophytes on the abandoned lands to enhance their evapotranspiration might be an option to help form more effective dry drainage systems between the abandoned lands and the adjacent croplands and help better control the root zone salinity of the croplands besides constructing more effective dry drainage systems via planting halophytes on the abandoned lands the high spatial and temporal variation of soil moisture and soil salinity in the field could be better captured in future studies it is recommended to conduct a spatial temporal quantification study of soil moisture soil salinity groundwater table depth and soil hydraulic properties on the cropped and abandoned lands using high

9258,in arid and semi arid irrigation areas with shallow water tables and fragmented arrangement of croplands and abandoned lands dry drainage could be an optional management practice mitigating soil salinization a dry drainage system lets non irrigated abandoned lands serve as evaporative salt sinks receiving water and salt fluxes from adjacent irrigated croplands therefore this research takes a typical dry drainage unit in the hetao irrigation district one abandoned land and its adjacent croplands as an example to directly reveal the field scale water and salt migration between abandoned lands and adjacent croplands it was found that during the growing season the water input i e field irrigation and precipitation raised the water table of the croplands and drove water and salt migration from croplands to the abandoned lands however the evapotranspiration in the croplands was also larger than that in the abandoned lands thus during the intervals of irrigation the phreatic evaporation periods in some circumstances evapotranspiration could drive water and salt flux from the abandoned lands to the croplands which would influence the groundwater salinity of the croplands therefore it is recommended to plant halophytes on the abandoned lands to enhance its evapotranspiration and hinder the water and salt flux from the abandoned lands to the croplands during intervals of irrigation this management practice could help form more effective dry drainage systems between abandoned lands and adjacent croplands and help better control the root zone salinity of the croplands keywords dry drainage farmland fallow area salinity groundwater lateral flow data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction soil salinization threatens more than 1 5 of the irrigated areas in the world lekakis and antonopoulos 2015 mao et al 2020 a traditional way to mitigate secondary soil salinization was the artificial drainage the excess salt was leached from the root zone and drained through the artificial drainage systems wang et al 2019a wu et al 2009 however the construction and long term maintenance cost of an artificial drainage system and the related downstream water quality deterioration problems hinder the implementation of artificial drainage systems abedi koupai et al 2020 thus the dry drainage systems arose as an alternative in 1992 growing and wyseure 1992 a dry drainage system is consisted of a non irrigated fallow area and an irrigated cropland the salt in the cropland soil leaches with excess irrigation water into groundwater moves towards the fallow area through lateral groundwater flow and accumulates in the topsoil of the fallow area via evapotranspiration konukcu et al 2006 in the past three decades dry drainage has been researched and adopted by producers world widely in the indus basin in pakistan konukcu 2006 konukcu et al 2006 in the san joaquin valley of california in the usa khouri 1998 in the hetao irrigation district in china wang et al 2019a 2020a 2019b wu et al 2009 in iran abedi koupai et al 2020 akram et al 2008 ansari et al 2019 and in australia greenwood et al 1994 1992 the effectiveness of dry drainage systems and its influential factors have been studied ever since their emergence it was proposed that a dry drainage system could be effective if the water removed from the fallow area via evapotranspiration could exceed the recharge of the fallow area by the lateral flow from the irrigated cropland wang et al 2019a more specifically when designing or evaluating a dry drainage system the width ratio of cropland to fallow area and the limiting groundwater depth need to be determined and the long term impact of salt accumulation on the fallow area need to be considered akram et al 2008 konukcu 2006 soltani et al 2018 sotoodehnia et al 2015 the factors influencing the effectiveness of dry drainage systems include the soil properties the crop types the climatic conditions and the costs and benefits khouri 1998 a mainstream model to simulate the water and salt migration in a dry drainage system and evaluate its effectiveness was proposed by konukcu et al 2006 in this model the irrigated cropland leaches salt from its root zone whereas the fallow area receives saline groundwater from the irrigated cropland and accumulates salt in its soil profile via evaporation however the model has several critical assumptions 1 during the growing season evaporation should not exceed field irrigation plus precipitation for croplands 2 capillary rise could be neglected in croplands during the growing season 3 the deep percolation from the cropland is assumed to move through groundwater and eventually evaporate from the fallow area and 4 during the fallow period of the irrigated cropland it is treated as a fallow area via model simulation konukcu et al 2006 suggested that when the water table was around 1 5 m depth and the irrigated cropland and its sink area were of roughly equal area a dry drainage system could be effective after the model developed by konukcu et al 2006 both experimental observation and model simulation of dry drainage systems have further advanced for example with a loamy soil lysimeter ansari et al 2019 observed the accumulation ratio of regular ions in the topsoil of the fallow area they illustrated that sodium potassium calcium nitrate and chloride accumulated in the topsoil with an accumulation ratio of 1 67 1 20 1 81 2 58 and 1 20 respectively whereas magnesium accumulated in the deep layers and its accumulation ratio in the topsoil was 0 90 and the transport processes of the ions in their dry drainage system were quantified with a hydrus 2d model abedi koupai et al 2020 the hetao irrigation district hid is one of the largest irrigation areas in china where irrigation and drainage systems and water and salt migration processes have been intensely investigated to improve crop production gao et al 2014 xu et al 2010 as a novel drainage system to mitigate secondary salinization dry drainage has been investigated in the hid for decades for instance wu et al 2009 obtained the cropped area and the non cropped area in the hid by calculating the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and cutting by a threshold and they obtained the salt affected area in the hid by maximum likelihood supervised classification then the salt removed from the croplands was estimated by a water and salt balance model the major assumption of the model was that the groundwater always flowed from the irrigated croplands to the non irrigated abandoned area during the growing season the residual salt in the system was estimated by the difference between the inlet salt via irrigation and the outlet salt via artificial drainage the results showed that about 72 of the inlet salt remained in the system however the actual salt affected irrigated area was on average only 6 6 of the total irrigated area in the hid from 1972 to 2004 thus they believed that the dry drainage must have played a very important role in controlling the soil salinity of the irrigated areas to further prove the effectiveness of the dry drainage systems in the hid they monitored the inlet irrigation water the discharge of the artificial drainage canals the groundwater level and ec and soil water content for one year in a study area of 29 km2 in the central hid based on the monitored data they conducted water and salt balance calculation for the 29 km2 study area following the same way as they did for the hid they concluded that the water and salt drained by the dry drainage were 9 6 and 16 times respectively larger than that of the artificial drainage similar to the field monitoring and water and salt balance calculation by wu et al 2009 wang et al 2019a conducted a five year field monitoring from 2007 to 2011 in the yonglian experimental station and calculated the water and salt balance of the monitored 29 km2 study area it was found that of all the excess water and salt migrated from the croplands to the fallow areas the artificial drainage systems only took up about 18 9 of the water and 11 5 of the salt and the rest was via the dry drainage systems researchers have also established water and salt balance models of a cropland 0 037 km2 abandoned land 0 043 km2 salt lake 0 512 km2 dry drainage system located at the junction of the jiefangzha subdistrict and the yongji subdistrict of the hid wang et al 2020a 2019b they estimated the effect of groundwater depth on soil salinity and revealed that the groundwater depth of the croplands should be controlled in the range of 1 7 2 3 m to form an effective dry drainage system however in the hid the croplands the abandoned lands and the salt lakes take up 5740 km2 2090 km2 and 130 km2 respectively wang et al 2020a 2019b thus only very limited dry drainage systems are the cropland abandoned land salt lake dry drainage systems most of the dry drainage systems are consisted of fragmented arranged adjacent croplands and abandoned areas which are far from salt lakes more specifically in the hid the croplands and abandoned areas are not intentionally designed but rather arranged by the relative land conditions among the adjacent fields the relatively high areas with lower salinity were cultivated and cropped while the relatively low areas with higher salinity were abandoned resulting in very fragmented arrangement of croplands and abandoned areas thus the ideal dry drainage condition assuming unidirectional lateral flow from croplands to abandoned areas may not always hold and due to the very shallow water table of the hid the ideal dry drainage condition assuming unidirectional salt movement from the root zone of the croplands to groundwater and then to the topsoil of the abandoned areas may not always hold as well therefore for an estimation of the relative contributions of the artificial drainage and dry drainage systems at large scales 30 km2 and above the water and salt balance calculation of wu et al 2009 and wang et al 2019a are very helpful however the actual contribution of the dry drainage systems at field scale i e the actual water and salt flux from irrigated croplands to adjacent non irrigated abandoned areas still waits to be revealed therefore it is in need to 1 reveal whether the typical dry drainage systems consisted of fragmented arranged croplands and adjacent abandoned lands in the hid are truly effective in salinity control at field scale or not and 2 provide recommendations on developing more effective dry drainage systems in the hid based on their current condition thus we directly monitored the soil profiles and groundwater of a typical dry drainage unit in the hid which consisted of one abandoned land and its adjacent croplands our objectives are 1 to reveal the water and salt balance and dynamics of the croplands and the abandoned land 2 to discover the actual water and salt flux between the croplands and the abandoned land and 3 to provide targeted recommendations for cropland salinity control 2 methods 2 1 experimental setup the field monitoring was conducted in the guangming no 2 village 40 55 40 73 n 107 9 53 07 e in the hid fig 1a located in arid and semi arid area the hid has an annual precipitation of 120 220 mm an annual evaporation of 2000 mm and an annual average temperature of 7 c wang et al 2022a the study site had one abandoned land and three croplands named the north cropland 2 ncl2 the north cropland 1 ncl1 the abandoned land al and the east cropland ecl from the north to the east fig 1c in 2018 ncl2 was planted with squash and ncl1 and ecl were planted with sunflower fig 2 while in 2019 all the three croplands were planted with sunflower the growth stages of sunflower and squash fig 3 are observed and verified by local studies dai et al 2011 du et al 2014 jian et al 2019 wang et al 2021 the meteorological data was obtained from the vantage pro 2 weather station located at the shahaoqu experimental station about 1 km from the study site with the measured meteorological data the reference evapotranspiration eto fig 2 was obtained by the penman monteith equation following fao 56 allen et al 1998 the croplands were flood irrigated with water diverted from the yellow river with a salinity of 0 6 g l chang 2019 chen et al 2005 nachshon 2018 the irrigation schedule and the total volume of each irrigation event were recorded fig 4 the l shaped study site with a total length and width of 154 m and 128 m respectively was equipped with a total of 8 vertical groundwater monitoring wells the circles in fig 1c and allocated with 4 soil sampling sites the triangles in fig 1c the wells were arranged to monitor groundwater flow in two perpendicular directions the wells n1 n2 n3 k2 e1 and k1 were arranged to monitor groundwater and salt flow from the north to the south while the wells e3 e2 e1 k2 and k1 were arranged to monitor groundwater and salt flow from the east to the west each groundwater monitoring well was supported by a pvc tube open at the bottom with a diameter of 11 cm and a length of 8 m the underground part was perforated and wrapped with screen to prevent sediment from entering the pvc tube each groundwater monitoring well was equipped with a hydros 21 auto logging sensor meter group inc usa monitoring the groundwater

water content vwc and soil electrical conductivity ec were automatically monitored hourly by hydra probe sensors stevens water monitoring systems inc portland oregon united states of america equipped at 20 40 60 100 and 140 cm depth besides the hourly automatic soil profile monitoring soil samples were taken weekly and right before and after each irrigation event for the vwc and ec1 5 the ec of the 1 5 soil to water extract lab measurement the soil samples were taken by 7 layers 0 20 cm 20 40 cm 40 60 cm 60 80 cm 80 100 cm 100 120 cm and 120 140 cm the measured soil ec1 5 ms cm was converted to soil salinity ss g kg by ss 3 480 ec 1 5 0 236 r 2 0 993 wang et al 2020b different from the weekly soil samples for the vwc and the ec1 5 lab measurement the soil physical properties listed in table 1 such as the soil bulk density ρ b and the saturated water content θ s are relatively stable thus the soil samples for these relatively stable physical properties were taken once and for all when the water table depth was more than 140 cm and the samples were taken by 5 layers 0 20 cm 20 40 cm 40 60 cm 60 100 cm and 100 140 cm table 1 the soil particle distribution and texture were determined by a laser particle size analyzer mastersizer 2000 malvern instruments ltd united kingdom the soil bulk density ρ b was measured by oven drying the soil hydraulic parameters i e the residual water content θ r the saturated water content θ s the inverse of the air entry value α the pore size distribution index n and the saturated hydraulic conductivity k s were inversely solved with hydrus 1d the calibration data was the daily average vwc of each soil layer in the 2018 growing season and the validation data was the daily average vwc of each soil layer in the 2019 growing season with these soil hydraulic parameters the field capacity θ fc the vwc at 0 33 bar i e 336 5 cm pressure head was calculated with the van genuchten equation van genuchten 1980 1 θ θ r θ s θ r 1 α h n m where m 1 1 n h 336 5 cm and the value of all the other parameters i e θ r θ s α and n are listed in table 1 2 2 water balance analysis since the studied croplands were adjacent to other croplands and the studied abandoned land was a part of a large abandoned land the boundaries of the l shaped study site were assumed to be no flux boundaries in this shallow water table area the water table depth varied between 50 and 150 cm during about 70 of the growing season therefore the 0 50 cm vadose zone was chosen to calculate the water balance instead of the commonly chosen 0 100 cm root zone for the croplands the soil water balance equation can be simplified to 2 w p i g et r where δw is the total change of the soil water storage of the 0 50 cm soil layer during the growing season mm p is the growing season total precipitation mm l is the growing season total field irrigation mm g is the growing season total capillary rise mm et is the growing season total evapotranspiration mm and r is the growing season total deep percolation mm for the non irrigated abandoned land the soil water balance equation can be further simplified to 3 w p g et r where et is the growing season total evapotranspiration mostly soil evaporation mm the vertical water flux through the 50 cm depth q v cm d positive for upward and negative for downward was calculated daily by the darcy s law under unsaturated conditions tindall et al 1999 4 s e θ θ r θ s θ r 5 ψ m 1 α se 1 m 1 1 n 6 k θ k s s e 0 5 1 1 s e 1 m m 2 7 q v k θ 1 ψ m z 8 ψ m z ψ m z ψ m 60 ψ m 40 60 40 9 g 10 q v 0 q v 10 r 10 q v 0 q v where θ θ r and θ s are the daily average residual and saturated volumetric water content at 50 cm respectively and are approximated by the average of θ θ r and θ s at 40 and 60 cm depth respectively s e is called the effective saturation ψ m is the matric potential cm α is the inverse of the air entry value n is the pore size distribution index and m 1 1 n k θ is the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity cm d at 50 cm depth and its calculation is provided by eq 6 van genuchten 1980 eq 8 shows how to use the ψ m at 60 and 40 cm depth i e ψ m60 and ψ m40 to obtain the approximation of ψ m z the capillary rise g mm and the deep percolation r mm were the summation of the upward and downward water flux through the 50 cm depth and were converted from centimeter to millimeter by a factor of 10 i e eq 9 and eq 10 respectively the et of each cropland and the abandoned land was adjusted from the eto by multiplying the crop coefficient k c and the water stress coefficient k s following fao 56 allen et al 1998 11 et et o k c k s 12 k s 1 0 58 0 04 et c θ i θ wp θ fc θ wp θ i θ j 1 θ i θ j where θ fc is the vwc at field capacity cm3 cm3 listed in table 1 θ wp is the vwc at wilting point which can be roughly estimated by 2θ r cm3 cm3 θ j is the threshold vwc below which transpiration is reduced due to water stress cm3 cm3 and its calculation is provided by fao 56 allen et al 1998 the locally adjusted k c for different stages of sunflower and squash are shown in fig 3 whereas the k c for the abandoned land was estimated by the kc value during the initial period kc ini as suggested by the fao 56 allen et al 1998 for bare soil the kc ini of squash 0 3 was much less than the fao 56 tabulated value 0 5 because the wetting interval of the squash field during the initial stage nfl2 in 2018 fig 4 was more than 20 days the kc value for full grown crops kc mid of both sunflower 1 01 and squash 0 872 were lower than the fao 56 tabulated value 1 15 for sunflower and 0 95 for squash because the wind speed was mostly 0 1 0 3 m s much less than the standard u 2 2 m s and the minimum relative humidity rhmin was mostly 60 70 significantly more than the standard rhmin 45 during the mid season fig 2 although the hid located in the arid and semi arid region the irrigation complemented the precipitation shortage and both the mean relative humidity rhmean and rhmin are high during the growing season fig 2 the squash was not harvested until september 28th when all the leaves were dead thus the kc value at the end of the late season stage kc end of squash can be estimated by the kc value suggested by the fao 56 for bare soil besides the above analyzed vertical water migration terms for shallow water table areas the adjacent fields are hydrologically connected via lateral groundwater flow and the capillary rise g was largely dependent on the water table depth van hoorn and van alphen 1994 therefore the lateral groundwater flow l mm was also calculated for the abandoned land by 13 l μ δ h where µ 0 033 is the specific yield measured by the local hydrological bureau wang et al 2019a and δh is the sum of the water table elevation differences in the abandoned land before and after each irrigation mm 2 3 dynamics of soil water and groundwater and their salinities the daily average of the automatically monitored hourly soil vwc and ec1 5 and the weekly lab measured soil vwc and ec1 5 were integrated and 2d interpolated to obtain the soil water and salt dynamics during the two whole growing seasons the 8 groundwater monitoring wells were arranged in a way that water table elevation in the north south direction could be obtained at 6 different positions and the water table elevation in the east west direction could be obtained at 5 different positions fig 1c thus the daily average of the automatically monitored hourly water table elevation and the groundwater ec at the 8 groundwater monitoring wells were 2d interpolated to obtain the groundwater flow field and the groundwater ec spatial distribution of the l shaped study site on each day respectively all of the 2d interpolations including the spatial and temporal interpolation of soil vwc and ec1 5 and the spatial interpolation of groundwater elevation and ec in two directions were performed by surfer 13 the soil salt accumulation or desalinization was obtained by subtracting the soil salt storage after irrigation from that before irrigation and the soil salt storage w kg m2 was obtained by the summation of the soil salt in each soil layer 14 w 0 01 ss ρ b d where ss is the soil salinity g kg ρ b is the soil bulk density g cm3 of each soil layer d is the depth of each soil layer and 0 01 is the conversion factor 2 4 lateral water and salt fluxes the lateral water flux between adjacent fields q l cm d was obtained by darcy s law 15 q l k s h l where k s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity cm d h is the groundwater elevation difference cm and l is the horizontal distance between the two groundwater monitoring wells cm and the associated lateral salt flux between adjacent fields q l c g mg d 1 cm 2 was the product of the water flux between the lands q l cm d and the groundwater salinity c g g l at the source monitoring well 3 results and discussion 3 1 water balance and dynamics during the growing season the water balance was obtained for the croplands and the abandoned land during both the 2018 and 2019 growing seasons may 15th to september 15th fig 5 the precipitation fig 2 and field irrigation fig 4 were measured the evapotranspiration was calculated by eq 11 for the croplands and the abandoned land the deep percolation and capillary rise were obtained for the 0 50 cm soil layer by eq 9 and eq 10 respectively and the lateral groundwater flow from the croplands to the abandoned land was obtained by eq 13 overall at the study site during the growing season the precipitation was 78 12 mm the field irrigation evapotranspiration deep percolation and capillary rise in the croplands were 429 60 mm 278 18 mm 248 36 mm and 201 26 mm respectively and the evapotranspiration deep percolation and capillary rise of the abandoned land and the lateral groundwater flow into the abandoned land were 129 4 mm 82 28 mm 263 7 mm and 105 9 mm respectively overall in the 2018 growing season there was more precipitation higher temperature and larger eto fig 2 and more irrigation in the croplands fig 4 than those in the 2019 growing season this led to larger deep percolation 263 24 mm vs 232 38 mm and larger evapotranspiration 286 23 mm vs 270 0 mm and capillary rise 211 3 mm vs 191 34 mm in the croplands in the 2018 growing season whereas the capillary rise and the evapotranspiration mostly evaporation from the abandoned land did not change much the relatively stable capillary rise and evaporation in the abandoned area might be due to a relatively stable shallow water table depth range during both growing seasons note that in 2019 the squash in ncl2 was replaced by sunflower fig 5 and the k c curve changed accordingly fig 3 the water dynamics in the 0 140 cm soil profiles were obtained for the croplands and the abandoned land during both the 2018 and 2019 growing seasons may 1st to september 15th fig 6 the saturated soil water content and the field capacity of each soil layer in each land are tabulated in table 1 in general the 100 140 cm soil layer was saturated 0 469 0 533 cm3 cm3 as most of the time it was under the water table the 60 100 cm soil layer was moist mostly 0 390 0 500 cm3 cm3 as the water table fluctuated in this range whereas the moisture of the 0 40 cm soil layer dramatically fluctuated between 0 218 and 0 480 cm3 cm3 as it was affected by the water input precipitation field irrigation evapotranspiration deep percolation and capillary rise fig 6 the vwc around 40 cm in the ecl reached the lowest after august 30th 2018 due to the insufficient irrigation amount in the ecl during the fourth irrigation fig 4 the al received lateral groundwater flow from the adjacent croplands i e ncl1 and ecl during the growing season fig 5a and b resulting in the high vwc 0 358 0 478 cm3 cm3 in the 60 140 cm layer whereas the vwc in the 0 40 cm 0 248 0 450 cm3 cm3 was mainly the results of the precipitation and capillary rise the ncl2 was not adjacent to the al thus its soil moisture and soil salinity dynamics had little influence on those of the al taking the al and the ncl1 in the 2018 growing season as an example the soil water dynamics after each irrigation between the abandoned land and its adjacent cropland was analyzed fig 6a in 2018 the ncl1 maintained high soil moisture 0 430 cm3 cm3 before the first irrigation probably thanks to the frozen period after the autumn irrigation in 2017 wang et al 2022b thus receiving a small amount of first irrigation 65 mm ncl1 leached quickly by gravity this resulted in a sharp rise in the water table elevation by 1246 mm on may 18th and the soil layer remained moist 0 470 0 485 cm3 cm3 below the 40 cm depth then it was the period dominated by the evapotranspiration the topsoil became drier and the drying front reached 60 cm depth and the water table elevation declined by 1323 mm on june 19th it was the time of the second irrigation 144 mm with more water this time more irrigation water was stored in the soil profile and less was leached to the groundwater this resulted in a soil vwc 0 410 0 470 cm3 cm3 similar to that after the first irrigation but the water table elevation increase 825 mm was less than that after the first irrigation again after a period of evapotranspiration domination the water table elevation declined by 780 mm then the third irrigation 139 mm was carried out on july 15th with less amount of irrigation water than the second irrigation this resulted in lower vwc 0 395 0 437 cm3 cm3 in the 0 60 cm layer and less water table elevation increase 460 mm than those after the previous two irrigations after a long period of evapotranspiration domination the drying front reached 110 cm depth and the water table depth reached 2096 mm the last irrigation of a small amount 130 mm increased soil moisture but did not percolate to groundwater much overall the vwc profile of the ncl1 showed high consistency with its water table elevation variation during the growing season whereas the abandoned land al had different vwc dynamics from that of the ncl1 because the al received no irrigation but received water from precipitation and lateral groundwater flow from adjacent croplands after their irrigation in addition the evapotranspiration 133 mm mainly evaporation was much less than that of the croplands 253 304 mm fig 5 therefore the wetting front in the soil moisture profile of the al after irrigations was not as high as that of the ncl1 while the drying front due to the evapotranspiration was not as deep as that of the ncl1 during the 2019 growing season fig 6b the general vwc dynamic patterns of both the ncl1 and the al were similar to those during the 2018 growing season fig 6a except that the vwc profile of the ncl1 showed continuous deepening drying front after its third irrigation in the 2019 growing season fig 6b because it received only three irrigations in the 2019 growing season fig 4 and the vwc profile of the al showed corresponding dynamics 3 2 soil salt dynamics during the growing season the soil salinity had been well controlled during the growing seasons for the croplands fig 7 following dpird 2021 for loams ec1 5 0 20 ms cm is non saline 0 20 ms cm ec1 5 0 40 ms cm is slightly saline 0 40 ms cm ec1 5 0 80 ms cm is moderately saline and 0 80 ms cm ec1 5 1 60 ms cm is highly saline for most of the time during both growing seasons the croplands root zone 0 80 cm salinity kept in the range of non saline blue regions and slightly saline green and yellow regions after each irrigation the croplands did desalt from the top while the abandoned land accumulated salt on the top during the 2018 growing season fig 7a though this was not clear during the 2019 growing season due to the missing topsoil data fig 7b the variation of the 0 50 cm vadose zone soil salt storage before and after the third irrigation in 2018 was analyzed as an example to demonstrate the soil salt variation corresponding to irrigation fig 8 before the third irrigation the 0 50 cm soil salt storage of the ncl2 ncl1 and ecl were 0 543 kg m2 0 856 kg m2 and 0 639 kg m2 respectively whereas the 0 50 cm soil salt storage of the al was 5 43 kg m2 about 10 times higher than that of the croplands after the third irrigation the soil salt storage of the ncl2 ncl1 and ecl were 0 403 kg m2 0 623 kg m2 and 0 523 kg m2 and the desalination rate were 25 78 27 30 and 18 12 respectively the soil salt of the croplands was leached by the irrigation and migrated to the abandoned land via lateral groundwater flow in the abandoned land salt accumulated in the topsoil due to evaporation and the accumulation rate of the 0 50 cm soil salt storage was 9 44 of its background value 5 43 kg m2 within five days there existed a relatively low ec region in each soil profile fig 7 below the lower limit of this region the soil salinity was dominated by the fluctuation of the water table i e the longer waterlogging time the higher the soil salinity whereas above the lower limit of this region the soil salinity was the balance of leaching and evapotranspiration interestingly the relatively low salinity region of the abandoned land 20 10 cm was generally shallower than those of the croplands 20 10 cm of ncl2 90 10 cm of ncl1 and 40 10 cm of ecl in the 2018 growing season fig 7a whereas it 90 10 cm was deeper than ncl2 60 10 cm ncl1 40 10 cm and ecl 40 10 cm in the 2019 growing season fig 7b the main reason was that there was no irrigation on the abandoned area until an accident irrigation during the autumn irrigation in 2018 after the 2018 growing season before that accident irrigation the only leaching water was precipitation and the lateral flow from the croplands continuously provided water for evapotranspiration in the abandoned land year after year the overall soil salinity of the abandoned land was one magnitude larger than that of the croplands fig 7a the salt accumulated in the topsoil of the abandoned land reduced the rate of water vapor flux thus the stationary evaporation front i e the evaporation front when water vapor flux balances capillary rise flux should be shallower than those of the croplands and due to the salt leaching of the abandoned land by that accident irrigation the soil salt storage in the 30 140 cm of the abandoned area dropped 10 45 in 2019 fig 7b though the topsoil salinity data was missing in 2019 and the relatively low salinity region also deepened 3 3 lateral water and salt flux during the growing season for an ideal dry drainage system it was usually assumed that the irrigation water leached from the croplands and migrated to the abandoned lands via lateral groundwater flow from where it evaporated konukcu et al 2006 wu et al 2009 along this way the salt migrated from the cropland root zone to the abandoned land where it accumulated in the topsoil for example the groundwater always flowed from the ecl to the al though before irrigation flowed slowly 0 0021 cm d fig 9a and after irrigation on may 16th flowed quickly 0 12 cm d fig 9b the fast flow subsided quickly on may 31st fig 9c the flow restored to the state before the irrigation 0 005 cm d which lasted until the second irrigation on june 19th fig 9d and the flux between the ncl1 and the al in 2019 generally followed the same pattern fig 10d however the monitored water table elevation and calculated water and salt flux showed that this ideal assumption may not always hold in actual dry drainage systems taking the ncl1 and the al in the 2018 growing season for example fig 10a before irrigation water flowed slowly 0 0014 cm d from the al to the ncl1 after the ncl1 received an irrigation on may 18th the water table elevation of the ncl1 rose and water flowed quickly 0 033 cm d from the ncl1 to the al the lateral groundwater flow from the farmlands to the al continued until the water table elevation of the al rose to the same level as that of the ncl1 on may 26th fig 10b then the water table was dropping due to capillary rise due to the large crop transpiration in the croplands and the salt clogged soil pore spaces in the abandoned lands the evapotranspiration in the ncl1 was larger than that of the al 304 mm vs 133 mm during the 2018 growing season fig 5a causing larger phreatic evaporation i e the direct evaporation from the groundwater brunner et al 2008 in the ncl1 thus the groundwater flowed slowly 0 003 cm d from the al to the ncl1 this happened most of the time in the 2018 growing season between the ncl1 and the al and the salt migrated with water fig 10a the surprisingly large fluxes from the al to the ncl1 during both growing seasons fig 10a and d were due to the irrigation on the ecl from the west side which raised the water table of the al ahead of the ncl1 this example showed that the growing season of the croplands should be divided into several irrigation periods and phreatic evaporation periods by the direction of the vertical flux fig 10c and f during the irrigation periods the croplands should be calculated as the irrigated area proposed by konukcu et al 2006 whereas during the phreatic evaporation periods the croplands should be calculated as the fallow area proposed by konukcu et al 2006 the lateral groundwater flow between the croplands and the abandoned land would influence the groundwater salinity of the croplands fig 11 before the first irrigation the al had an about 17 1 ds m groundwater salinity and the croplands had an about 2 64 ds m groundwater salinity fig 11a as the result of receiving the thawed soil water of different salinities wang et al 2022b after the first irrigation the croplands groundwater was diluted by the deep percolation of the mixture of soil water and irrigated water and its salinity dropped fig 11b the al groundwater was diluted by the lateral groundwater coming from the croplands and its salinity was continuously decreasing until the end of the growing season fig 11a f however the croplands groundwater salinity gradually increased due to occasionally receiving lateral groundwater coming from the al fig 11c f 4 conclusions in arid and semiarid irrigation areas with fragmented croplands and abandoned lands and shallow water tables like the hetao irrigation district the dry drainage systems were not designed intentionally but rather formed by the relative elevation and soil salinity of the adjacent fields in this case the ideal dry drainage concept that assumes net leaching in croplands net evapotranspiration in fallow areas and unidirectional water and salt flux from the croplands to the fallow areas may not always hold our two year field monitoring demonstrated that the lower part of the cropland root zone suffered from waterlogging of saline groundwater while besides the leaching by irrigation and precipitation the upper part of the cropland root zone suffered from salt accumulation during intervals in irrigation the phreatic evaporation periods due to its large evapotranspiration the lateral water and salt flux was flowing from the irrigated croplands to the abandoned land within several days after an irrigation event the irrigation period whereas the lateral water and salt flux direction could be reversed during the phreatic evaporation periods due to larger evapotranspiration in croplands than that in the abandoned land the abandoned land groundwater salinity was continuously diluted during the growing season whereas the occasional lateral groundwater flow from the abandoned land to the croplands would gradually increase the groundwater salinity of the croplands therefore planting halophytes on the abandoned lands to enhance their evapotranspiration might be an option to help form more effective dry drainage systems between the abandoned lands and the adjacent croplands and help better control the root zone salinity of the croplands besides constructing more effective dry drainage systems via planting halophytes on the abandoned lands the high spatial and temporal variation of soil moisture and soil salinity in the field could be better captured in future studies it is recommended to conduct a spatial temporal quantification study of soil moisture soil salinity groundwater table depth and soil hydraulic properties on the cropped and abandoned lands using high

9259,poultry litter pl is a majority waste of the intensive avian production commonly used as an organic amendment in agricultural soils we studied the input of pollutants from the pl as inorganic p and ionophore antibiotics ipa and the influence on soil pollutants glp and ampa in real systems after a rainfall simulation on an agronomic amended soil with pl at two residence times physicochemical parameters were altered in the runoff after the amendment pl from commercial farms present a preliminary load of monensin and salinomycin the mobility of ipa by surface runoff 0 8 31 and leaching 0 4 38 was determined with monensin showing the maximum losses in both processes at both residence times pl amendments act as a pollution diffuse source of ipa moreover the amendment enhanced the mobility of glp and ampa in soils maximum losses of glp in runoff increased from 0 56 to 9 84 in soil with pl treatment the results were related to the amounts of p released in the surface runoff strategies for reducing the animal wastes and their antibiotic content must be investigated regarding the productive practice involving these residues as water and soil conservation are proven to be a key asset in the sustainability and success of circular economy processes this is the first study to demonstrate the combined release of pollutants from multiple origins after the amendment with poultry litter on real agricultural soils graphical abstract ga1 keywords monensin ionophore antibiotics organic amendment agricultural pollutants phosphorus losses data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction poultry litter pl is a majority waste of the intensive avian production and constitutes one of the most worrying issues for agricultural producers worldwide in argentina over 6 700 000 tons of pl are generated annually maisonnave et al 2015 the residue is primarily composed of bedding material chicken excreta and animal waste the nitrogen phosphorus and organic matter levels of the pl provide exploitable characteristics for its application as an organic amendment in agricultural soils adding value to the residue as a part of a circular economy strategy due to the time and space requirements the application of treatments such as composting is difficult to conduct in real practice so poultry litter is commonly applied fresh raw riera et al 2014 the material is usually applied in doses from 5 to 10 ton ha 1 according to the crop needs almada et al 2016 however depending on its composition and previous treatments addition of salts composting substantial amounts of nutrients can be released from the litter application through surface runoff schroeder et al 2004 phosphorus is a key element in nutrient management and its loss through runoff processes causes a variety of problems from economic disadvantages to environmental damage such as eutrophication of aquatic systems these amendments can also function as a pollution diffuse source of veterinary antibiotics furtula et al 2010 sun et al 2013 the confinement and overcrowding conditions to which animals are submitted at intensive animal production systems have demanded the usage of antibiotics to prevent the rapid spread of diseases chapman et al 2010 ionophore polyether antibiotics ipa are one of the most extensively used families in avian production which act mainly as coccidiostats lekshmi et al 2017 and can also act as growth promoters efsa 2008 ipa are administered throughout the life cycle in doses ranging from 70 to 125 mg kg 1 of dry food european union commision 2003 european union commission 2008 after the ingestion ipa are not completely absorbed in the intestine of birds gallus domesticus and up to 80 of the administered compound can be excreted in their parental form and therefore be found in pl biswas et al 2012 efsa 2008 these compounds could be released into the soil after application of the pl and be consequently mobilized by surface runoff or percolation into the environment reaching water bodies such as rivers or lakes sarmah et al 2006 sun et al 2013 ipa have been previously characterized as environmental risk pollutants hansen et al 2009 recent studies for ipa in argentina demonstrated the extent of their environmental dynamics with monensin being detected in rivers with flows up to 320 m3 seg 1 far from productive facilities and even at the paraná river delta alonso et al 2019 the mobility of ipa by runoff and percolation processes after simulated rain events on soil has been previously reported kim et al 2010 sun et al 2013 soil characteristics as organic matter can also affect the dynamics of the ipa either through the retention of the compounds or their degradation potential kim et al 2010 doydora et al 2017 the reported range of soil sorption coefficients as logkoc for these compounds is 2 9 4 2 for las 1 9 3 8 for mon and 1 9 3 2 for sal mooney et al 2020 in addition to the contribution of substances from the poultry litter it is important to evaluate how its application has an impact on contaminants already present in the receiving soil pl application increases nutrient species in soils as dissolved organic matter dom and phosphorus species dutta et al 2012 tewolde et al 2020 the ability of phosphates to desorb agricultural pollutants as glyphosate and ampa glp has been demonstrated in several types of soils gimsing et al 2004 padilla and selim 2019 and has been reported to have significant more weight than dom okada et al 2016 this effect was observed on argiudol soils from argentina where glyphosate desorption phenomena have been reported after chemical fertilization with inorganic p sasal et al 2015 glyphosate has been reported as a soil pollutant in multiple regions from argentina primost et al 2017 alonso et al 2018 castro berman et al 2018 which is the third largest producer of genetically modified soybeans with more than 55 million tons produced annually therefore the present work emerges considering the reported use of poultry litter as organic amendment in several crops and its generation under antibiotic dependent systems the magnitude of the amendment practice and the lack of studies with focus on the potential situation regarding multiple environmental consequences of the practice the objective was to study the loss of phosphorus the input of ionophore antibiotics into soils and their mobility by runoff of leaching processes and the subsequent effect on the mobility of soil pollutants as glyphosate and its metabolite aminomethylphosphonic acid ampa after the simulation of a rainfall event on a real agricultural soil amended with commercial poultry litter 2 materials and methods 2 1 runoff simulation poultry litter was provided by a local poultry farm from entre ríos province with no specific preliminary treatment rainfall simulation trials were conducted in agricultural fields from the inta s agricultural experimental station of paraná entre ríos which were never exposed to poultry litter or any other animal amendment the studied soil was aquic argiudol of the tezanos pinto series table 1 with an a horizon of 18 cm sisinta 2021 before application of poultry litter soybean plants and stubble were removed from the surface the experimental design of the study is detailed in table 2 before the trial soil samples were collected initial soils n 3 for glp and ampa analysis plots were divided into unamended soils ua soils and soils amended with poultry litter pl soils the ua soils consisted of 3 random plots that were kept unamended to contrast the influence of the practice on soluble phosphorus glp and its metabolite ampa for pl soils two independent sets of plots from the agricultural field were tested at 24 n 9 and 72 h n 9 after pl application plots of 1 m2 were randomly selected for each treatment and pl 46 moisture was applied on the soil surface pl soils in a scaled amount according to reported conventional practice application rate 5 ton ha 1 assuming a minimal dose scenario almada et al 2016 prior to the trials pl was fractionated in 3 parts for the corresponding ionophore transport study one fraction was kept unchanged control and the other 2 were fortified with monensin mon salinomycin sal and lasalocid las at 0 1 mg kg 1 c1 and 1 mg kg 1 c2 both concentrations were selected to simulate real loads of ipa according to preliminary reports furtula et al 2009 sun et al 2013 a portable simulator fig 1a was selected to perform rainfall simulations irurtia and mon 1994 the device was located perpendicular to the ground surface once positioned at the center of each 1 m2 plot the simulator delimited a 0 25 m x 0 25 m work area this device allowed applying constant rainfall intensity between 10 and 130 mm h 1 on each plot sasal et al 2015 a rainfall of 120 mm h 1 was established reflecting a worst case scenario as reported by kim et al 2010 at 115 mm h 1 which also allowed each entire test 24 and 72 h to be carried out in a single day a running time of approximately 2 h per plot was achieved rain was simulated with dechlorinated tap water 2 2 solvents and reagents all solvents used in chemical and chromatographic analysis were hplc grade and all inorganic salts were analytical grade jt baker mallinckrodt baker inc usa a sartorius arium water purification system sartorius ag göttingen the netherlands was used to obtain ultrapure water analytical standards of the studied ipa mon sal and las glp and ampa isotopically labeled glyphosate 2 13c 15n glp 2 13c 15n and 9 fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl chloride fmoc cl were purchased via sigma aldrich st louis mo usa 2 3 sampling and extraction methods sampling started at the beginning of the runoff process collecting water in a graduated tank mm at regular intervals of 5 min until constant runoff which was accomplished after three equal and consecutive volume measurements indicating that the basic soil infiltration rate was achieved sasal et al 2015 general parameters as ph and electric conductivity ec were determined in situ with the lutron multi parameter probe yk 2001ph and yk 200pct runoff water collected on each plot was divided into 2 fractions the fraction destined for ipa analysis was stored into 500 ml amber glass bottles with 1 of meoh to avoid microbial degradation alonso et al 2019 and were stored at 20 c until further analysis the other fraction was separated for glp and ampa dissolved reactive phosphorus drp analysis and total suspended solids drp was determined by the colorimetric procedure according to american public health association apha 1998 for the total suspended solids 100 ml of runoff water were filtered in situ through a pre weighed 0 45 µm pore size nylon filter diameter 47 mm which were placed in a desiccator for 24 h for drying and weighed to determine the weight mac loughlin et al 2020 pl samples from each treatment were collected before rainfall simulation soil samples were taken at different depths after the simulation integrated fractions at surface 0 2 cm and sub surface level 2 20 cm were collected at five points from the plot fig 1b adapting the design by kim et al 2010 each soil fraction was homogenized in situ and kept at 20 c until further analysis dry weight of soil and pl was measured at 105 c until constant mass and organic matter content was determined by loss on ignition at 430 c samla 2004 for runoff samples the extraction method was adapted from sun et al 2013 briefly 7 5 ml of mcilvaine buffer ph 7 10 mm na2edta and 2 5 ml of meoh were added to 30 ml of the water sample followed by two ultrasound cycles 10 hexane 5 ml was added to the tubes and after 30 min shaking and 10 min centrifugation the organic layer was transferred to a glass tube the procedure was repeated twice and the combined hexane extracts were evaporated to dryness under n2 stream and were reconstituted with 0 5 ml of meoh prior to lc ms ms analysis the extracts were added 0 5 ml of a 5 mm na2edta solution and then filtered by 0 22 µm alonso et al 2019 for soils and pl a similar method was applied starting with 3 g of the solid samples instead sun et al 2013 surrogate samples from the different matrices were analyzed to evaluate the analytical recovery and matrix effect matched matrix solutions were surrogated with known concentrations of ipa to assess the matrix effect the recoveries of ipa in each analyzed matrix ranged between 56 and 82 pl 89 94 runoff water and 67 81 soils in the same order as reported by other authors sun et al 2013 arikan et al 2016 for glp and ampa analysis in soils pl and runoff waters pre column derivatization was applied with fmoc cl 5 g of solid samples were spiked with 13c 15n glp the analytes were extracted according to primost et al 2017 adding 25 ml of a 0 1 m k2hpo4 solution followed by 3 cycles of ultrasound extraction of 10 min each the extracts were centrifuged and a 2 ml aliquot was adjusted to ph 9 with na2b4o7 40 mm and added with 2 ml of a fmoc cl acn solution 1 mg ml 1 and left overnight for water samples a 2 ml aliquot was treated equivalently to the soil extracts standard solutions and reagent blanks were prepared under equivalent operational conditions for calibration and quantification purposes finally derivatized samples were extracted with 5 ml of dichloromethane centrifuged and the aqueous supernatant filtered through a membrane of 0 22 μm pore size before lc ms ms analysis for glp and ampa the isotopically labeled glp was used as an internal standard for the evaluation of the global recovery within each sample with average values of 81 4 and 78 5 for water and soil samples in agreement to previous studies primost et al 2017 alonso et al 2018 2 4 instrumental analysis the analysis of ipa glp and ampa was carried out with a quattro premier xe tandem quadrupole mass spectrometer waters equipped with an electrospray ionization source set in the positive mode the mass spectrometer was set to operate in multiple reaction monitoring mrm mode sodium adducts of ipa were selected as precursor ions m na alonso et al 2019 the optimized conditions for the chromatographic analysis of ipa glp and ampa were previously optimized and reported by alonso et al 2019 and primost et al 2017 parameters as linearity reproducibility detection and quantification limits lod and loq respectively were tested accordingly the ratio between the chromatographic areas of two mass transitions and the retention times were selected as analytical criteria sante 2019 quantification was conducted with external calibration curves for the most abundant mass transition for each pollutant primost et al 2017 alonso et al 2019 2 5 data analysis the software masslynx v4 1 and the targetlynx package were used for data analysis since the concentration data did not follow a normal distribution nonparametric tests kruskal wallis test and pairwise comparison were applied for the statistical analysis of the data set a spearman correlation coefficient test was employed to evaluate the relations between concentration of nutrients and pollutants in runoff water and soils at both depths all the tests were set at a significance level of 0 05 and the statistical analyses performed by means of the infostat software 3 results and discussion 3 1 physicochemical characteristics of the runoff a comparative analysis was performed between the water quality parameters in the collected runoff regarding the application of the pl ua soils vs pl soils at the 72 h residence time table 3 specific information for each plot is supplied in the supplementary material an increase in the ph p 0 0008 ec p 0 0433 and drp p 0 0034 values was observed when pl was applied the variation of ph and ec is consistent with the contribution of slightly alkaline materials from the pl table 3 as for drp the levels found in the runoff from pl soils were even higher than the concentration 2 03 mg l 1 reported for soils amended with a rate of 7 ton ha 1 of pl in georgia usa schroeder et al 2004 suspended solids in the runoff were not affected by the amendment p 0 05 application of pl enhances the water retention capacity of soils as the local aquic argiudoll but reduces rainwater infiltration which can lead to higher runoff flows and soluble p losses which can be transported by runoff and reach nearby surface water bodies lamelas et al 2019 no significant differences were found between ph ec and drp within 24 h and 72 h residence times of the pl schroeder et al 2004 reported a decrease in the p losses from pl amendments at least 30 days after the application the median drp concentrations quantified table 3 in runoff water of pl soil were 4 0 mg l 1 24 h and 3 6 mg l 1 72 h both higher than the level reported by sasal et al 2015 in runoff 2 6 mg l 1 collected 24 h after the application of an inorganic fertilizer 100 kg ha 1 of calcium triple superphosphate on the same studied soils the pl soil mixture constitutes a long lasting source of p that releases the nutrient over longer periods of time and multiple rainfall events kleinman and sharpley 2003 several approaches like alum addition and composting have been reported as efficient methods to prevent the risk of p losses wang et al 2015 saleem et al 2018 moreover the application rate of poultry litter is commonly calculated based on nitrogen supply reaching values four times greater than those used in the present work over 20 ton ha 1 of fresh pl according to the proper regulatory limit of micropollutants as cu and zn lamelas et al 2019 in this scenario the p input is oversupplied and applications of fresh pl can lead to even greater p losses decreasing water quality and causing environmental effects such as eutrophication garcía albacete et al 2012 other environmental consequences of the mobilization of soluble phosphorus species involve competition of sorption sites from soils enhancing pollutants desorption and therefore their transport from soils into runoff or the soil column sections 3 2 2 1 and 3 3 2 3 2 input and mobility of ionophore antibiotics 3 2 1 poultry litter the studied pl collected from a local farm from entre rios showed mean residual concentrations of mon and sal figs 2 3a 3b of 9 15 μg kg 1 and 1219 1473 μg kg 1 respectively the lod of both mon and sal was 0 5 μg kg 1 as for las initial levels in the pl were below the lod 1 μg kg 1 these results agreed with previously reported low degradation rates on these biosolids where both ipa were persistent for over 3 years biswas et al 2012 and mon being less affected than sal dolliver and gupta 2008 sun et al 2014 quantified concentrations of ipa in the studied pl were of the same order of magnitude as found in commercial farms from canada furtula et al 2009 and usa biswas et al 2012 sun et al 2014 these results characterize pl as an environmental source for these pollutants and ionophore levels that may vary geographically according to each poultry practice furtula et al 2009 particular attention is drawn to the difficulty of acquiring litter without the presence of these xenobiotics to for example develop different environmental studies furtula et al 2009 2010 biswas et al 2012 the intra variability among replicates 33 71 for quantified concentrations of mon and sal in pl agreed with the range 23 97 reported by furtula et al 2009 this variability is also explained by the heterogeneity characteristics of the solid matrix and the small mass considered for the chemical analysis 3 2 2 surface runoff 3 2 2 1 concentrations of ipa in surface runoff for the ipa analysis pl soils were subdivided in 3 categories control c1 and c2 section 2 1 the results of ipa in the runoff water are shown in fig 2 the 3 studied ipa were detected in the runoff with mon and sal being detected at both treatments after 24 and 72 h residence time as expected from pl levels runoff concentrations of sal from c1 and c2 plots showed no differences from the control plots and the mean concentrations of sal at 24 and 72 h in runoff were 4 3 2 5 μg l 1 and 3 8 1 3 μg l 1 for mon c2 mean concentrations in the runoff at 24 1 5 1 4 μg l 1 and 72 h 0 7 0 4 μg l 1 were higher than the control samples of each time p 0 05 the mobility of las was affected by residence time being detected at c1 only at 72 h meanwhile the response at 72 h on surface runoff agreed with the expected spiked concentration on pl c2 0 040 0 014 μg l 1 c1 0 004 0 002 μg l 1 control lod it is noteworthy that its presence in runoff increased over a short period of residence time from 24 to 72 h since other authors reported that a decrease in antibiotic losses started a week after the manure application barrios et al 2020 also sassman and lee 2007 reported an inverse correlation of las sorption coefficients koc with soil ph for several organic soils whereas in this work the increased mobility occurred when the runoff ph was lower table 3 it is expected that other factors not analized in the present study dom clay content play a major role in las sorption and desorption equilibriums in a real soil scenario sassman and lee 2007 swan 2012 the concentrations of mon in runoff water were positively correlated with sal concentrations table b and c in supplementary materials and both were significantly correlated with ec and drp at 24 h after the application of pl conversely to the 24 h results mon concentrations mobilized by runoff at 72 h were not related to any of the other measured parameters the solubility of mon depends on its chemical speciation anion protonated and sodium potassium adduct and it is affected by multiple interrelated physicochemical parameters therefore even a slight ph decrease as observed at 72 h could have influenced its equilibrium in the runoff sun et al 2016 at 72 h sal instead was still correlated to ec and drp and was the only ipa that maintained a positive association with the concentration of soluble phosphorus at both times which agreed with the reported capacity of phosphates to desorb sal from pl ramaswamy et al 2012 3 2 2 2 runoff losses in the environmental context runoff losses were calculated as the ratio percentage between the mass of ipa in runoff water and the initial mass in pl for mon runoff losses at both times were up to 31 24 h and 22 72 h of the total mass respectively higher than those reported by other authors kim et al 2010 reported a runoff transport of 0 26 from soils sprayed with liquid manure spiked with mon while dolliver and gupta 2008 indicated a maximum transport of 2 after applying bovine manure directly on arable soils differences between ipa sources application methodologies and residence time before rainfall event are influential factors on the partition of the pharmaceuticals to runoff doydora et al 2015 barrios et al 2020 being pl application on surface soils the one exhibiting higher loss percentages lower mobility percentages were registered for sal 17 and las 3 5 reflecting maximum concentrations of 9 86 μg l 1 and 0 055 μg l 1 in runoff water respectively sal was previously quantified in surface runoff from litter fertilized soils at levels up to 9 0 μg l 1 sun et al 2013 on the other hand no further information of las mobilization from pl was found in the literature from an environmental perspective the overall ranges of mean concentration values for mon and las fig 2 found in runoff 0 020 1 450 μg l 1 even at c2 were within the range of ipa reported for surface water bodies of the pampas region 0 004 4 670 μg l 1 by alonso et al 2019 and of the same order as other environmental concentrations reported in rivers from different countries lissemore et al 2006 bak and björklund 2014 the specific case of sal is noteworthy since a significantly higher initial load of in the pl determined higher runoff concentrations with values up to 1 order of magnitude higher than the maximums observed in surface waters adjacent to husbandry facilities 1 150 μg l 1 alonso et al 2019 3 2 3 soils the concentration of ipa at surface 0 2 cm fig 3a and subsurface 2 20 cm depth a horizon fig 3b soils was analyzed most concentrations of ipa at the 2 20 cm were one or even two magnitude orders below the concentrations quantified at the 0 2 cm layer at both times las was only quantified in 0 2 cm soils at c2 and under the tested conditions did not show a movement beyond 2 cm in depth emerging at the 2 20 cm layer only at the 72 h treatment this lower mobility of las is in accordance with its higher sorption coefficient range when compared to mon and sal the 2 20 cm 0 2 ratio as a percentage of mon was up to 38 at 72 h reaching higher values than those obtained at 24 h fig 3a b other authors found that mon is mobilized in the soil column to a depth of 30 cm obtaining the maximum percentage 36 1 at a depth of 20 cm kim et al 2010 regarding sal no statistical differences were found in the vertical mobility percentages between both residence times in comparison with the losses of sal by leaching in the 2 20 cm soil layer a lower proportion than mon was observed reaching a maximum of 9 7 μg kg 1 this range was less than the expected according to the initial concentrations in the pl and considering that sal was previously reported on the 10 20 cm fraction of soils at 30 μg kg 1 in soils amended with manure bak and björklund 2014 it is important to mention that after the rainfall no differences regarding mon and sal concentration were found between c1 and control plots in soils and runoff section 3 2 2 1 those results indicate a close behavior of both compounds in soils as reflected by their similar koc range section 1 1 furthermore spiked levels of mon and sal were masked by the preliminary load of the compounds in pl higher additions of the pollutants were not assayed as they would have generated non real solid matrices the mobility of ipa in the soil column depends on the composition and consequently physicochemical properties of the soil sassman and lee 2007 at the studied soil typical ph values are in the vicinity of 5 7 tezanos pinto inta and thus the transport of ipa can be favored due to the prevalence of the anionic species in their speciation equilibrium sassman and lee 2007 sun et al 2016 soil organic matter som is expected to play an important role in the sorption of mon biswas 2014 found a positive correlation between soil sorbed mon and organic matter from 74 soils ranging between 0 1 and 3 1 however depending on the ph higher amounts of som provided by the amendments increase dom which facilitate mon desorption and transport in the soil column biswas 2014 doydora et al 2017 in the present study som increased from 2 67 before pl to 7 6 0 2 cm and 4 8 2 20 cm table 3 which represent a high organic content scenario according to yoshida et al yoshida et al 2010 and possibly explained by the fact that surface applied pl is not subjected to rapid microbial descomposition nyakatawa et al 2001 regarding sal it is expected that other factors have a higher influence than som on its sorption such as the content of clay or sand or phosphate levels section 3 2 2 1 further studies should aim to understand specific sorption and persistence processes with regards to those levels of som and the resulting dom as another influential factor derived from the amendment the application of pl in the present study led to ipa concentrations into soil fractions corresponding to the rhizosphere which could be uptaken by crops broekaert et al 2012 translocation could suppose a route of human exposure to these pollutants through food which raises the need for its regulation and must be included in quality controls and agri food safety 3 3 mobilization of glyphosate and ampa 3 3 1 soils glyphosate and ampa were not detected in pl 0 1 μg kg 1 both compounds were quantified in the 0 2 cm fraction of the initial soils from the studied site with mean maximum concentrations of 40 1 19 8 μg kg 1 62 7 μg kg 1 and 61 8 22 3 μg kg 1 87 3 μg kg 1 respectively concentrations of both compounds were of the same order as those previously reported by sasal et al 2015 for the same fields no interactions were found between ipa glp and ampa concentrations thus all pl soils were treated as one group in contrast to the ua soils after the rainfall simulation assays quantifiable concentrations of glp and ampa were detected in both analyzed fractions of soils fig 4a b and in runoff water fig 4c the concentrations of glp in the surface 0 2 cm fraction were significantly lower p 0 0102 than those detected in the surface soils before the rainfall higher mean concentrations of glp and ampa fig 4a b were detected in surface soils 22 2 7 7 μg kg 1 and 57 6 19 5 μg kg 1 respectively than those found at the 2 20 cm layer 10 4 2 4 μg kg 1 and 8 0 5 1 μg kg 1 respectively in the studied real agricultural system glp and ampa were retained in the upper fraction of soils rather than mobilized to subsurface layers in accordance with the results of okada et al 2016 no statistical differences were observed between the residual concentrations of glp and ampa detected in the ua soils and pl soils in both fractions the glp ampa ratio table 4 was calculated to analyze patterns in the distribution regarding the surface soil 0 2 cm the ratio at the 0 2 cm fraction was similar for both soil treatments indicating a prevalence of ampa in the upper fraction which okada et al 2018 reported as more persistent than the parent glp an opposite scenario was observed for the ratio glp ampa at 2 20 cm with the values 1 indicating a higher relevance of glp in the lower fraction considering the similar concentrations of glp at 2 20 cm in both soils ua and s pl the lower ratio determined for the amended soils reflects the influence of the pl in the concentrations of ampa fig 4b the amount of p incorporated by the pl section 3 2 into the soil favors the desorption of ampa when competing for sorption sites sidoli et al 2016 in a larger extent these results support with insight to the studies of demonte et al 2018 and okada et al 2018 who found a higher relevance of ampa in groundwater from argentina where p fertilizers are applied besides glp formulations as part of the chemical management in which the production model is based sasal et al 2015 3 3 2 runoff for surface runoff waters higher levels of glp p 0 0386 were found in water collected from pl soils 1 6 1 1 μg l 1 than in ua soils 0 16 0 06 μg l 1 in contrast to ampa in which case no statistical differences were detected between treatments the ratio between runoff and initial soil concentrations are similar to those reported by sasal et al 2015 the relative mobility in runoff is favorable to glp also reflected in the glp ampaglp ampa ratio table 4 which might have been a consequence of specific desorption mechanisms in the amended pl soils moreover positive correlations were found between glp and both drp r 0 73 p 0 0074 and ec r 0 71 p 0 010 in runoff which denotes the relevance of the inorganic content supplied by the pl in the sorption and the consequent input of the herbicide into the water the loss of the glp was calculated as the percentage in runoff with regards to the concentrations in the studied soils before rainfall after 1 h rainfall simulations ua soils exhibited glp losses up to 0 56 while losses from pl soils reached a maximum of 9 84 fig 4 c increased phosphate levels were previously reported as desorption promoters of glp gimsing et al 2004 padilla and selim 2019 and the process was verified after chemical fertilization with industrial phosphorus based products in argentinean soils of the same characteristics as those studied in the present work sasal et al 2015 this interaction has been widely described from chemical fertilizers but not at the same extent for the organic amendments such as pl this being one of the first works to report this process in argentina the results indicate that the mobilization of glp could be associated with p sources independently of their nature however since the behavior of ampa in runoff showed no differences between ua and pl soils neither it was not related to the other variables studied other factors could be involved in the glp desorption mechanism besides the phosphonic acid moiety furthermore glp concentrations in the runoff samples were inversely correlated to the water ph p 0 048 in this way sorption of glp not ampa due to the absence of the carboxylic group is also affected by ph with desorption being higher in acidic soils munira et al 2018 as the one we studied in the present work the results obtained in the present study were registered after a single rainfall event at each time therefore if physicochemical properties of the soil are affected resulting in lower ph conditions and high loads of p remain in the surface layer of soil these pollutants could be released again after the next rainfall event moreover long term applications can transform these systems into permanent sources of these compounds as has been reported for drp bos et al 2021 and increase the desorption and therefore their mobility of pollutants in the soil as glp and ampa munira et al 2018 or mon doydora et al 2017 the lesser retention of these pollutants favors their transport to aquatic systems by surface runoff both ipa alonso et al 2019 glp and ampa primost et al 2017 castro berman et al 2018 have been previously reported on aquatic environments from agroproductives zones of argentina however the application of pl in adjacent fields has not been considered as a relevant exposure source yet considering the extensive use of this herbicide in current agriculture the risk of compounds mobilization after pl application should be assessed and further research of the consequences must be addressed 4 conclusions the present work comprised a field scale study which characterized the effect of pl application on soils regarding the input and mobility of agricultural pollutants as ionophores glp and ampa after a rainfall simulation the pl modified the physicochemical characteristics of the runoff and contributed a load of dissolved phosphorus which affects the sorption and transport of soil pollutants pl provided by local commercial farms showed quantifiable residual loads of mon and sal which were mobilized by surface runoff mon was the most detected compound in all the studied matrices showing the maximum losses in both processes a decrease in soil glp concentrations was observed after the rainfall simulation inversely an increased transport via runoff was observed when pl was added to the soil ampa exhibited highest concentrations at the surface layer reflecting its strong binding to soil particles according to the glp ampa ratio glp was more susceptible to be transported in the runoff and to lower soil layers the increased concentration of soluble phosphorus is a relevant factor in the mobility of these compounds and other parameters as ph can be also intervening the use of poultry litter as an organic amendment in agricultural soils is a widespread practice due to the contribution of nutrients and the material recycling in terms of circular economy however the practice constitutes a diffuse source of high loads of nutrients and veterinary antibiotics and involves the release of soil pollutants that influence surface and groundwater quality according to the environmental dynamics of each compound in perspective strategies for reducing the animal wastes and their antibiotic content must be investigated regarding the productive practice involving these residues as water and soil conservation are proven to be a key asset in the sustainability and success of circular economy processes also alternative production systems must be approached to preserve the usage of substances as antibiotics as recommended by fao and who this is the first study to demonstrate the combined release of pollutants from multiple sources after the amendment with poultry litter on real agricultural soils further research should aim to characterize the potential risk

9259,poultry litter pl is a majority waste of the intensive avian production commonly used as an organic amendment in agricultural soils we studied the input of pollutants from the pl as inorganic p and ionophore antibiotics ipa and the influence on soil pollutants glp and ampa in real systems after a rainfall simulation on an agronomic amended soil with pl at two residence times physicochemical parameters were altered in the runoff after the amendment pl from commercial farms present a preliminary load of monensin and salinomycin the mobility of ipa by surface runoff 0 8 31 and leaching 0 4 38 was determined with monensin showing the maximum losses in both processes at both residence times pl amendments act as a pollution diffuse source of ipa moreover the amendment enhanced the mobility of glp and ampa in soils maximum losses of glp in runoff increased from 0 56 to 9 84 in soil with pl treatment the results were related to the amounts of p released in the surface runoff strategies for reducing the animal wastes and their antibiotic content must be investigated regarding the productive practice involving these residues as water and soil conservation are proven to be a key asset in the sustainability and success of circular economy processes this is the first study to demonstrate the combined release of pollutants from multiple origins after the amendment with poultry litter on real agricultural soils graphical abstract ga1 keywords monensin ionophore antibiotics organic amendment agricultural pollutants phosphorus losses data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction poultry litter pl is a majority waste of the intensive avian production and constitutes one of the most worrying issues for agricultural producers worldwide in argentina over 6 700 000 tons of pl are generated annually maisonnave et al 2015 the residue is primarily composed of bedding material chicken excreta and animal waste the nitrogen phosphorus and organic matter levels of the pl provide exploitable characteristics for its application as an organic amendment in agricultural soils adding value to the residue as a part of a circular economy strategy due to the time and space requirements the application of treatments such as composting is difficult to conduct in real practice so poultry litter is commonly applied fresh raw riera et al 2014 the material is usually applied in doses from 5 to 10 ton ha 1 according to the crop needs almada et al 2016 however depending on its composition and previous treatments addition of salts composting substantial amounts of nutrients can be released from the litter application through surface runoff schroeder et al 2004 phosphorus is a key element in nutrient management and its loss through runoff processes causes a variety of problems from economic disadvantages to environmental damage such as eutrophication of aquatic systems these amendments can also function as a pollution diffuse source of veterinary antibiotics furtula et al 2010 sun et al 2013 the confinement and overcrowding conditions to which animals are submitted at intensive animal production systems have demanded the usage of antibiotics to prevent the rapid spread of diseases chapman et al 2010 ionophore polyether antibiotics ipa are one of the most extensively used families in avian production which act mainly as coccidiostats lekshmi et al 2017 and can also act as growth promoters efsa 2008 ipa are administered throughout the life cycle in doses ranging from 70 to 125 mg kg 1 of dry food european union commision 2003 european union commission 2008 after the ingestion ipa are not completely absorbed in the intestine of birds gallus domesticus and up to 80 of the administered compound can be excreted in their parental form and therefore be found in pl biswas et al 2012 efsa 2008 these compounds could be released into the soil after application of the pl and be consequently mobilized by surface runoff or percolation into the environment reaching water bodies such as rivers or lakes sarmah et al 2006 sun et al 2013 ipa have been previously characterized as environmental risk pollutants hansen et al 2009 recent studies for ipa in argentina demonstrated the extent of their environmental dynamics with monensin being detected in rivers with flows up to 320 m3 seg 1 far from productive facilities and even at the paraná river delta alonso et al 2019 the mobility of ipa by runoff and percolation processes after simulated rain events on soil has been previously reported kim et al 2010 sun et al 2013 soil characteristics as organic matter can also affect the dynamics of the ipa either through the retention of the compounds or their degradation potential kim et al 2010 doydora et al 2017 the reported range of soil sorption coefficients as logkoc for these compounds is 2 9 4 2 for las 1 9 3 8 for mon and 1 9 3 2 for sal mooney et al 2020 in addition to the contribution of substances from the poultry litter it is important to evaluate how its application has an impact on contaminants already present in the receiving soil pl application increases nutrient species in soils as dissolved organic matter dom and phosphorus species dutta et al 2012 tewolde et al 2020 the ability of phosphates to desorb agricultural pollutants as glyphosate and ampa glp has been demonstrated in several types of soils gimsing et al 2004 padilla and selim 2019 and has been reported to have significant more weight than dom okada et al 2016 this effect was observed on argiudol soils from argentina where glyphosate desorption phenomena have been reported after chemical fertilization with inorganic p sasal et al 2015 glyphosate has been reported as a soil pollutant in multiple regions from argentina primost et al 2017 alonso et al 2018 castro berman et al 2018 which is the third largest producer of genetically modified soybeans with more than 55 million tons produced annually therefore the present work emerges considering the reported use of poultry litter as organic amendment in several crops and its generation under antibiotic dependent systems the magnitude of the amendment practice and the lack of studies with focus on the potential situation regarding multiple environmental consequences of the practice the objective was to study the loss of phosphorus the input of ionophore antibiotics into soils and their mobility by runoff of leaching processes and the subsequent effect on the mobility of soil pollutants as glyphosate and its metabolite aminomethylphosphonic acid ampa after the simulation of a rainfall event on a real agricultural soil amended with commercial poultry litter 2 materials and methods 2 1 runoff simulation poultry litter was provided by a local poultry farm from entre ríos province with no specific preliminary treatment rainfall simulation trials were conducted in agricultural fields from the inta s agricultural experimental station of paraná entre ríos which were never exposed to poultry litter or any other animal amendment the studied soil was aquic argiudol of the tezanos pinto series table 1 with an a horizon of 18 cm sisinta 2021 before application of poultry litter soybean plants and stubble were removed from the surface the experimental design of the study is detailed in table 2 before the trial soil samples were collected initial soils n 3 for glp and ampa analysis plots were divided into unamended soils ua soils and soils amended with poultry litter pl soils the ua soils consisted of 3 random plots that were kept unamended to contrast the influence of the practice on soluble phosphorus glp and its metabolite ampa for pl soils two independent sets of plots from the agricultural field were tested at 24 n 9 and 72 h n 9 after pl application plots of 1 m2 were randomly selected for each treatment and pl 46 moisture was applied on the soil surface pl soils in a scaled amount according to reported conventional practice application rate 5 ton ha 1 assuming a minimal dose scenario almada et al 2016 prior to the trials pl was fractionated in 3 parts for the corresponding ionophore transport study one fraction was kept unchanged control and the other 2 were fortified with monensin mon salinomycin sal and lasalocid las at 0 1 mg kg 1 c1 and 1 mg kg 1 c2 both concentrations were selected to simulate real loads of ipa according to preliminary reports furtula et al 2009 sun et al 2013 a portable simulator fig 1a was selected to perform rainfall simulations irurtia and mon 1994 the device was located perpendicular to the ground surface once positioned at the center of each 1 m2 plot the simulator delimited a 0 25 m x 0 25 m work area this device allowed applying constant rainfall intensity between 10 and 130 mm h 1 on each plot sasal et al 2015 a rainfall of 120 mm h 1 was established reflecting a worst case scenario as reported by kim et al 2010 at 115 mm h 1 which also allowed each entire test 24 and 72 h to be carried out in a single day a running time of approximately 2 h per plot was achieved rain was simulated with dechlorinated tap water 2 2 solvents and reagents all solvents used in chemical and chromatographic analysis were hplc grade and all inorganic salts were analytical grade jt baker mallinckrodt baker inc usa a sartorius arium water purification system sartorius ag göttingen the netherlands was used to obtain ultrapure water analytical standards of the studied ipa mon sal and las glp and ampa isotopically labeled glyphosate 2 13c 15n glp 2 13c 15n and 9 fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl chloride fmoc cl were purchased via sigma aldrich st louis mo usa 2 3 sampling and extraction methods sampling started at the beginning of the runoff process collecting water in a graduated tank mm at regular intervals of 5 min until constant runoff which was accomplished after three equal and consecutive volume measurements indicating that the basic soil infiltration rate was achieved sasal et al 2015 general parameters as ph and electric conductivity ec were determined in situ with the lutron multi parameter probe yk 2001ph and yk 200pct runoff water collected on each plot was divided into 2 fractions the fraction destined for ipa analysis was stored into 500 ml amber glass bottles with 1 of meoh to avoid microbial degradation alonso et al 2019 and were stored at 20 c until further analysis the other fraction was separated for glp and ampa dissolved reactive phosphorus drp analysis and total suspended solids drp was determined by the colorimetric procedure according to american public health association apha 1998 for the total suspended solids 100 ml of runoff water were filtered in situ through a pre weighed 0 45 µm pore size nylon filter diameter 47 mm which were placed in a desiccator for 24 h for drying and weighed to determine the weight mac loughlin et al 2020 pl samples from each treatment were collected before rainfall simulation soil samples were taken at different depths after the simulation integrated fractions at surface 0 2 cm and sub surface level 2 20 cm were collected at five points from the plot fig 1b adapting the design by kim et al 2010 each soil fraction was homogenized in situ and kept at 20 c until further analysis dry weight of soil and pl was measured at 105 c until constant mass and organic matter content was determined by loss on ignition at 430 c samla 2004 for runoff samples the extraction method was adapted from sun et al 2013 briefly 7 5 ml of mcilvaine buffer ph 7 10 mm na2edta and 2 5 ml of meoh were added to 30 ml of the water sample followed by two ultrasound cycles 10 hexane 5 ml was added to the tubes and after 30 min shaking and 10 min centrifugation the organic layer was transferred to a glass tube the procedure was repeated twice and the combined hexane extracts were evaporated to dryness under n2 stream and were reconstituted with 0 5 ml of meoh prior to lc ms ms analysis the extracts were added 0 5 ml of a 5 mm na2edta solution and then filtered by 0 22 µm alonso et al 2019 for soils and pl a similar method was applied starting with 3 g of the solid samples instead sun et al 2013 surrogate samples from the different matrices were analyzed to evaluate the analytical recovery and matrix effect matched matrix solutions were surrogated with known concentrations of ipa to assess the matrix effect the recoveries of ipa in each analyzed matrix ranged between 56 and 82 pl 89 94 runoff water and 67 81 soils in the same order as reported by other authors sun et al 2013 arikan et al 2016 for glp and ampa analysis in soils pl and runoff waters pre column derivatization was applied with fmoc cl 5 g of solid samples were spiked with 13c 15n glp the analytes were extracted according to primost et al 2017 adding 25 ml of a 0 1 m k2hpo4 solution followed by 3 cycles of ultrasound extraction of 10 min each the extracts were centrifuged and a 2 ml aliquot was adjusted to ph 9 with na2b4o7 40 mm and added with 2 ml of a fmoc cl acn solution 1 mg ml 1 and left overnight for water samples a 2 ml aliquot was treated equivalently to the soil extracts standard solutions and reagent blanks were prepared under equivalent operational conditions for calibration and quantification purposes finally derivatized samples were extracted with 5 ml of dichloromethane centrifuged and the aqueous supernatant filtered through a membrane of 0 22 μm pore size before lc ms ms analysis for glp and ampa the isotopically labeled glp was used as an internal standard for the evaluation of the global recovery within each sample with average values of 81 4 and 78 5 for water and soil samples in agreement to previous studies primost et al 2017 alonso et al 2018 2 4 instrumental analysis the analysis of ipa glp and ampa was carried out with a quattro premier xe tandem quadrupole mass spectrometer waters equipped with an electrospray ionization source set in the positive mode the mass spectrometer was set to operate in multiple reaction monitoring mrm mode sodium adducts of ipa were selected as precursor ions m na alonso et al 2019 the optimized conditions for the chromatographic analysis of ipa glp and ampa were previously optimized and reported by alonso et al 2019 and primost et al 2017 parameters as linearity reproducibility detection and quantification limits lod and loq respectively were tested accordingly the ratio between the chromatographic areas of two mass transitions and the retention times were selected as analytical criteria sante 2019 quantification was conducted with external calibration curves for the most abundant mass transition for each pollutant primost et al 2017 alonso et al 2019 2 5 data analysis the software masslynx v4 1 and the targetlynx package were used for data analysis since the concentration data did not follow a normal distribution nonparametric tests kruskal wallis test and pairwise comparison were applied for the statistical analysis of the data set a spearman correlation coefficient test was employed to evaluate the relations between concentration of nutrients and pollutants in runoff water and soils at both depths all the tests were set at a significance level of 0 05 and the statistical analyses performed by means of the infostat software 3 results and discussion 3 1 physicochemical characteristics of the runoff a comparative analysis was performed between the water quality parameters in the collected runoff regarding the application of the pl ua soils vs pl soils at the 72 h residence time table 3 specific information for each plot is supplied in the supplementary material an increase in the ph p 0 0008 ec p 0 0433 and drp p 0 0034 values was observed when pl was applied the variation of ph and ec is consistent with the contribution of slightly alkaline materials from the pl table 3 as for drp the levels found in the runoff from pl soils were even higher than the concentration 2 03 mg l 1 reported for soils amended with a rate of 7 ton ha 1 of pl in georgia usa schroeder et al 2004 suspended solids in the runoff were not affected by the amendment p 0 05 application of pl enhances the water retention capacity of soils as the local aquic argiudoll but reduces rainwater infiltration which can lead to higher runoff flows and soluble p losses which can be transported by runoff and reach nearby surface water bodies lamelas et al 2019 no significant differences were found between ph ec and drp within 24 h and 72 h residence times of the pl schroeder et al 2004 reported a decrease in the p losses from pl amendments at least 30 days after the application the median drp concentrations quantified table 3 in runoff water of pl soil were 4 0 mg l 1 24 h and 3 6 mg l 1 72 h both higher than the level reported by sasal et al 2015 in runoff 2 6 mg l 1 collected 24 h after the application of an inorganic fertilizer 100 kg ha 1 of calcium triple superphosphate on the same studied soils the pl soil mixture constitutes a long lasting source of p that releases the nutrient over longer periods of time and multiple rainfall events kleinman and sharpley 2003 several approaches like alum addition and composting have been reported as efficient methods to prevent the risk of p losses wang et al 2015 saleem et al 2018 moreover the application rate of poultry litter is commonly calculated based on nitrogen supply reaching values four times greater than those used in the present work over 20 ton ha 1 of fresh pl according to the proper regulatory limit of micropollutants as cu and zn lamelas et al 2019 in this scenario the p input is oversupplied and applications of fresh pl can lead to even greater p losses decreasing water quality and causing environmental effects such as eutrophication garcía albacete et al 2012 other environmental consequences of the mobilization of soluble phosphorus species involve competition of sorption sites from soils enhancing pollutants desorption and therefore their transport from soils into runoff or the soil column sections 3 2 2 1 and 3 3 2 3 2 input and mobility of ionophore antibiotics 3 2 1 poultry litter the studied pl collected from a local farm from entre rios showed mean residual concentrations of mon and sal figs 2 3a 3b of 9 15 μg kg 1 and 1219 1473 μg kg 1 respectively the lod of both mon and sal was 0 5 μg kg 1 as for las initial levels in the pl were below the lod 1 μg kg 1 these results agreed with previously reported low degradation rates on these biosolids where both ipa were persistent for over 3 years biswas et al 2012 and mon being less affected than sal dolliver and gupta 2008 sun et al 2014 quantified concentrations of ipa in the studied pl were of the same order of magnitude as found in commercial farms from canada furtula et al 2009 and usa biswas et al 2012 sun et al 2014 these results characterize pl as an environmental source for these pollutants and ionophore levels that may vary geographically according to each poultry practice furtula et al 2009 particular attention is drawn to the difficulty of acquiring litter without the presence of these xenobiotics to for example develop different environmental studies furtula et al 2009 2010 biswas et al 2012 the intra variability among replicates 33 71 for quantified concentrations of mon and sal in pl agreed with the range 23 97 reported by furtula et al 2009 this variability is also explained by the heterogeneity characteristics of the solid matrix and the small mass considered for the chemical analysis 3 2 2 surface runoff 3 2 2 1 concentrations of ipa in surface runoff for the ipa analysis pl soils were subdivided in 3 categories control c1 and c2 section 2 1 the results of ipa in the runoff water are shown in fig 2 the 3 studied ipa were detected in the runoff with mon and sal being detected at both treatments after 24 and 72 h residence time as expected from pl levels runoff concentrations of sal from c1 and c2 plots showed no differences from the control plots and the mean concentrations of sal at 24 and 72 h in runoff were 4 3 2 5 μg l 1 and 3 8 1 3 μg l 1 for mon c2 mean concentrations in the runoff at 24 1 5 1 4 μg l 1 and 72 h 0 7 0 4 μg l 1 were higher than the control samples of each time p 0 05 the mobility of las was affected by residence time being detected at c1 only at 72 h meanwhile the response at 72 h on surface runoff agreed with the expected spiked concentration on pl c2 0 040 0 014 μg l 1 c1 0 004 0 002 μg l 1 control lod it is noteworthy that its presence in runoff increased over a short period of residence time from 24 to 72 h since other authors reported that a decrease in antibiotic losses started a week after the manure application barrios et al 2020 also sassman and lee 2007 reported an inverse correlation of las sorption coefficients koc with soil ph for several organic soils whereas in this work the increased mobility occurred when the runoff ph was lower table 3 it is expected that other factors not analized in the present study dom clay content play a major role in las sorption and desorption equilibriums in a real soil scenario sassman and lee 2007 swan 2012 the concentrations of mon in runoff water were positively correlated with sal concentrations table b and c in supplementary materials and both were significantly correlated with ec and drp at 24 h after the application of pl conversely to the 24 h results mon concentrations mobilized by runoff at 72 h were not related to any of the other measured parameters the solubility of mon depends on its chemical speciation anion protonated and sodium potassium adduct and it is affected by multiple interrelated physicochemical parameters therefore even a slight ph decrease as observed at 72 h could have influenced its equilibrium in the runoff sun et al 2016 at 72 h sal instead was still correlated to ec and drp and was the only ipa that maintained a positive association with the concentration of soluble phosphorus at both times which agreed with the reported capacity of phosphates to desorb sal from pl ramaswamy et al 2012 3 2 2 2 runoff losses in the environmental context runoff losses were calculated as the ratio percentage between the mass of ipa in runoff water and the initial mass in pl for mon runoff losses at both times were up to 31 24 h and 22 72 h of the total mass respectively higher than those reported by other authors kim et al 2010 reported a runoff transport of 0 26 from soils sprayed with liquid manure spiked with mon while dolliver and gupta 2008 indicated a maximum transport of 2 after applying bovine manure directly on arable soils differences between ipa sources application methodologies and residence time before rainfall event are influential factors on the partition of the pharmaceuticals to runoff doydora et al 2015 barrios et al 2020 being pl application on surface soils the one exhibiting higher loss percentages lower mobility percentages were registered for sal 17 and las 3 5 reflecting maximum concentrations of 9 86 μg l 1 and 0 055 μg l 1 in runoff water respectively sal was previously quantified in surface runoff from litter fertilized soils at levels up to 9 0 μg l 1 sun et al 2013 on the other hand no further information of las mobilization from pl was found in the literature from an environmental perspective the overall ranges of mean concentration values for mon and las fig 2 found in runoff 0 020 1 450 μg l 1 even at c2 were within the range of ipa reported for surface water bodies of the pampas region 0 004 4 670 μg l 1 by alonso et al 2019 and of the same order as other environmental concentrations reported in rivers from different countries lissemore et al 2006 bak and björklund 2014 the specific case of sal is noteworthy since a significantly higher initial load of in the pl determined higher runoff concentrations with values up to 1 order of magnitude higher than the maximums observed in surface waters adjacent to husbandry facilities 1 150 μg l 1 alonso et al 2019 3 2 3 soils the concentration of ipa at surface 0 2 cm fig 3a and subsurface 2 20 cm depth a horizon fig 3b soils was analyzed most concentrations of ipa at the 2 20 cm were one or even two magnitude orders below the concentrations quantified at the 0 2 cm layer at both times las was only quantified in 0 2 cm soils at c2 and under the tested conditions did not show a movement beyond 2 cm in depth emerging at the 2 20 cm layer only at the 72 h treatment this lower mobility of las is in accordance with its higher sorption coefficient range when compared to mon and sal the 2 20 cm 0 2 ratio as a percentage of mon was up to 38 at 72 h reaching higher values than those obtained at 24 h fig 3a b other authors found that mon is mobilized in the soil column to a depth of 30 cm obtaining the maximum percentage 36 1 at a depth of 20 cm kim et al 2010 regarding sal no statistical differences were found in the vertical mobility percentages between both residence times in comparison with the losses of sal by leaching in the 2 20 cm soil layer a lower proportion than mon was observed reaching a maximum of 9 7 μg kg 1 this range was less than the expected according to the initial concentrations in the pl and considering that sal was previously reported on the 10 20 cm fraction of soils at 30 μg kg 1 in soils amended with manure bak and björklund 2014 it is important to mention that after the rainfall no differences regarding mon and sal concentration were found between c1 and control plots in soils and runoff section 3 2 2 1 those results indicate a close behavior of both compounds in soils as reflected by their similar koc range section 1 1 furthermore spiked levels of mon and sal were masked by the preliminary load of the compounds in pl higher additions of the pollutants were not assayed as they would have generated non real solid matrices the mobility of ipa in the soil column depends on the composition and consequently physicochemical properties of the soil sassman and lee 2007 at the studied soil typical ph values are in the vicinity of 5 7 tezanos pinto inta and thus the transport of ipa can be favored due to the prevalence of the anionic species in their speciation equilibrium sassman and lee 2007 sun et al 2016 soil organic matter som is expected to play an important role in the sorption of mon biswas 2014 found a positive correlation between soil sorbed mon and organic matter from 74 soils ranging between 0 1 and 3 1 however depending on the ph higher amounts of som provided by the amendments increase dom which facilitate mon desorption and transport in the soil column biswas 2014 doydora et al 2017 in the present study som increased from 2 67 before pl to 7 6 0 2 cm and 4 8 2 20 cm table 3 which represent a high organic content scenario according to yoshida et al yoshida et al 2010 and possibly explained by the fact that surface applied pl is not subjected to rapid microbial descomposition nyakatawa et al 2001 regarding sal it is expected that other factors have a higher influence than som on its sorption such as the content of clay or sand or phosphate levels section 3 2 2 1 further studies should aim to understand specific sorption and persistence processes with regards to those levels of som and the resulting dom as another influential factor derived from the amendment the application of pl in the present study led to ipa concentrations into soil fractions corresponding to the rhizosphere which could be uptaken by crops broekaert et al 2012 translocation could suppose a route of human exposure to these pollutants through food which raises the need for its regulation and must be included in quality controls and agri food safety 3 3 mobilization of glyphosate and ampa 3 3 1 soils glyphosate and ampa were not detected in pl 0 1 μg kg 1 both compounds were quantified in the 0 2 cm fraction of the initial soils from the studied site with mean maximum concentrations of 40 1 19 8 μg kg 1 62 7 μg kg 1 and 61 8 22 3 μg kg 1 87 3 μg kg 1 respectively concentrations of both compounds were of the same order as those previously reported by sasal et al 2015 for the same fields no interactions were found between ipa glp and ampa concentrations thus all pl soils were treated as one group in contrast to the ua soils after the rainfall simulation assays quantifiable concentrations of glp and ampa were detected in both analyzed fractions of soils fig 4a b and in runoff water fig 4c the concentrations of glp in the surface 0 2 cm fraction were significantly lower p 0 0102 than those detected in the surface soils before the rainfall higher mean concentrations of glp and ampa fig 4a b were detected in surface soils 22 2 7 7 μg kg 1 and 57 6 19 5 μg kg 1 respectively than those found at the 2 20 cm layer 10 4 2 4 μg kg 1 and 8 0 5 1 μg kg 1 respectively in the studied real agricultural system glp and ampa were retained in the upper fraction of soils rather than mobilized to subsurface layers in accordance with the results of okada et al 2016 no statistical differences were observed between the residual concentrations of glp and ampa detected in the ua soils and pl soils in both fractions the glp ampa ratio table 4 was calculated to analyze patterns in the distribution regarding the surface soil 0 2 cm the ratio at the 0 2 cm fraction was similar for both soil treatments indicating a prevalence of ampa in the upper fraction which okada et al 2018 reported as more persistent than the parent glp an opposite scenario was observed for the ratio glp ampa at 2 20 cm with the values 1 indicating a higher relevance of glp in the lower fraction considering the similar concentrations of glp at 2 20 cm in both soils ua and s pl the lower ratio determined for the amended soils reflects the influence of the pl in the concentrations of ampa fig 4b the amount of p incorporated by the pl section 3 2 into the soil favors the desorption of ampa when competing for sorption sites sidoli et al 2016 in a larger extent these results support with insight to the studies of demonte et al 2018 and okada et al 2018 who found a higher relevance of ampa in groundwater from argentina where p fertilizers are applied besides glp formulations as part of the chemical management in which the production model is based sasal et al 2015 3 3 2 runoff for surface runoff waters higher levels of glp p 0 0386 were found in water collected from pl soils 1 6 1 1 μg l 1 than in ua soils 0 16 0 06 μg l 1 in contrast to ampa in which case no statistical differences were detected between treatments the ratio between runoff and initial soil concentrations are similar to those reported by sasal et al 2015 the relative mobility in runoff is favorable to glp also reflected in the glp ampaglp ampa ratio table 4 which might have been a consequence of specific desorption mechanisms in the amended pl soils moreover positive correlations were found between glp and both drp r 0 73 p 0 0074 and ec r 0 71 p 0 010 in runoff which denotes the relevance of the inorganic content supplied by the pl in the sorption and the consequent input of the herbicide into the water the loss of the glp was calculated as the percentage in runoff with regards to the concentrations in the studied soils before rainfall after 1 h rainfall simulations ua soils exhibited glp losses up to 0 56 while losses from pl soils reached a maximum of 9 84 fig 4 c increased phosphate levels were previously reported as desorption promoters of glp gimsing et al 2004 padilla and selim 2019 and the process was verified after chemical fertilization with industrial phosphorus based products in argentinean soils of the same characteristics as those studied in the present work sasal et al 2015 this interaction has been widely described from chemical fertilizers but not at the same extent for the organic amendments such as pl this being one of the first works to report this process in argentina the results indicate that the mobilization of glp could be associated with p sources independently of their nature however since the behavior of ampa in runoff showed no differences between ua and pl soils neither it was not related to the other variables studied other factors could be involved in the glp desorption mechanism besides the phosphonic acid moiety furthermore glp concentrations in the runoff samples were inversely correlated to the water ph p 0 048 in this way sorption of glp not ampa due to the absence of the carboxylic group is also affected by ph with desorption being higher in acidic soils munira et al 2018 as the one we studied in the present work the results obtained in the present study were registered after a single rainfall event at each time therefore if physicochemical properties of the soil are affected resulting in lower ph conditions and high loads of p remain in the surface layer of soil these pollutants could be released again after the next rainfall event moreover long term applications can transform these systems into permanent sources of these compounds as has been reported for drp bos et al 2021 and increase the desorption and therefore their mobility of pollutants in the soil as glp and ampa munira et al 2018 or mon doydora et al 2017 the lesser retention of these pollutants favors their transport to aquatic systems by surface runoff both ipa alonso et al 2019 glp and ampa primost et al 2017 castro berman et al 2018 have been previously reported on aquatic environments from agroproductives zones of argentina however the application of pl in adjacent fields has not been considered as a relevant exposure source yet considering the extensive use of this herbicide in current agriculture the risk of compounds mobilization after pl application should be assessed and further research of the consequences must be addressed 4 conclusions the present work comprised a field scale study which characterized the effect of pl application on soils regarding the input and mobility of agricultural pollutants as ionophores glp and ampa after a rainfall simulation the pl modified the physicochemical characteristics of the runoff and contributed a load of dissolved phosphorus which affects the sorption and transport of soil pollutants pl provided by local commercial farms showed quantifiable residual loads of mon and sal which were mobilized by surface runoff mon was the most detected compound in all the studied matrices showing the maximum losses in both processes a decrease in soil glp concentrations was observed after the rainfall simulation inversely an increased transport via runoff was observed when pl was added to the soil ampa exhibited highest concentrations at the surface layer reflecting its strong binding to soil particles according to the glp ampa ratio glp was more susceptible to be transported in the runoff and to lower soil layers the increased concentration of soluble phosphorus is a relevant factor in the mobility of these compounds and other parameters as ph can be also intervening the use of poultry litter as an organic amendment in agricultural soils is a widespread practice due to the contribution of nutrients and the material recycling in terms of circular economy however the practice constitutes a diffuse source of high loads of nutrients and veterinary antibiotics and involves the release of soil pollutants that influence surface and groundwater quality according to the environmental dynamics of each compound in perspective strategies for reducing the animal wastes and their antibiotic content must be investigated regarding the productive practice involving these residues as water and soil conservation are proven to be a key asset in the sustainability and success of circular economy processes also alternative production systems must be approached to preserve the usage of substances as antibiotics as recommended by fao and who this is the first study to demonstrate the combined release of pollutants from multiple sources after the amendment with poultry litter on real agricultural soils further research should aim to characterize the potential risk of combined pollutants as glyphosate and ionophore antibiotics ethics approval and consent to participate not applicable credit authorship contribution statement marcos navarro methodology
