15110,ultraviolet disinfection is a promising solution for decentralized drinking water systems such as communal water taps a potential health risk is enzymatic photorepair of pathogens after uv disinfection which can result in regrowth of pathogens even though photorepair is a known issue no formal risk assessments have been conducted for photorepair after uv disinfection in drinking water the main objective was to construct a quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra of photorepair after uv disinfection of drinking water in a decentralized system uv disinfection and photorepair kinetics for e coli were modelled using reproducible fluence based determinations impacts of water collection patterns and wavelength dependent water container material transmittance sunlight intensity and photorepair enzyme absorbance were quantified after uv disinfection by 16 or 40 mj cm2 of 5 log microorganisms per l risk of infection did not exceed 1 in 10 000 under conditions permitting e coli photorepair risk from photorepair was less than 1 in 10 000 for photorepair light exposure 0 75 h throughout the day for uv fluence 16 mj cm2 or greater uv disinfection followed by solar disinfection surpassing photoreactivation during storage reduced risk below 1 in 10 000 for photorepair light exposure 2 5 h between modelled times of 9 am 3 pm the model can be expanded to other pathogens as uv fluence and photorepair fluence response kinetics become available and this qmra can be used to inform the placement of community water access points to reduce risk of photorepair and ensure adequate shelf life of uv disinfected water under safe storage conditions graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords uv disinfection qmra photorepair decentralized uv disinfection packaged water data availability as written in the manuscript r script and excel data files are available from github 1 introduction globally consumption of unsafe drinking water still causes nearly 829 000 preventable deaths annually who 2022 communities in rural remote and resource limited settings in the majority world commonly lack access to safely managed drinking water services such as treated water and piped water carter et al 1999 lee and schwab 2005 mattos et al 2021 contaminated water and lack of piped water systems force communities to adopt water consumption patterns that center on consuming packaged water distributed in containers such as plastic bottles or bags from communal water taps or water vendors vedachalam et al 2017 despite water treatment packaged water may still be microbially unsafe due to ineffective treatment re contamination or bacterial regrowth and repair during storage or transport cerna cortes et al 2019 diduch et al 2013 pant et al 2016 shahryari et al 2020 williams et al 2015 ultraviolet uv disinfection is a well established drinking water disinfection method and does not require adding chemicals to water which could result in formation of disinfection byproducts or adverse impacts on taste and odor dietrich and burlingame 2020 rossiter et al 2010 sharma and bhattacharya 2017 uv disinfection technology may provide socially and culturally appropriate solutions in developing regions of the world where the perception of chemically induced taste and odor in drinking water may deter people from consuming water that is otherwise safe crider et al 2018 goldhar et al 2013 lui et al 2014 yu jeco et al 2019 uv disinfection treats water by inducing dna damage to inactivate microorganisms and prevent them from carrying out metabolic activities such as replication and renders them unable to cause infection usepa 2006 a limitation to uv disinfection is that microorganisms such as bacteria possess intrinsic mechanisms that repair uv induced damage to dna two well known mechanisms of dna repair are photorepair and dark repair which are light dependent and light independent processes respectively sinha and häder 2002 photorepair is mediated by the photolyase enzyme which is activated by light between 300 and 500 nm kelner 1951 sancar et al 1987 sunlight and indoor light that emit wavelengths of light known to activate photolyase can potentially lead to photorepair when uv disinfected water is stored or transported indoors and outdoors following photorepair of dna microorganisms can potentially recover metabolic activity and the ability to cause infection also known as photoreactivation while photoreactivation is a known concern in uv treated drinking water hu et al 2012 kashamida et al 1996 sommer et al 2000 zimmer and slawson 2002 no formal health risk assessment has yet been performed quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra is powerful analytical framework used for evaluating microbial risks in drinking water blokker et al 2018 enger et al 2013 owens et al 2020 petterson and ashbolt 2016 schijven et al 2019 smeets et al 2009 as a photochemical treatment process uv disinfection does not physically remove bacteria from water therefore any observed increases in microorganism concentration in uv treated samples after exposure to photorepair light could be attributed to any combination of photorepair of dna photoreactivation of bacterial cells natural regrowth and dark repair bohrerova et al 2015 jungfer et al 2007 kollu and örmeci 2015 instead of using time based determinations of photorepair more precise and reproducible fluence based determination of photorepair dose should be used to account for light intensity and water characteristics and enable translation between studies and to applied settings bohrerova and linden 2007 schmidtlein et al 2015 shafaei et al 2017 here we demonstrate translation from laboratory photorepair results to informing risk based water system planning the purpose of this study was to construct a qmra model and use it for calculating the risk of infection from pathogens in packaged drinking water due to photorepair following uv disinfection qmra has not yet been conducted to assess risk of photorepair in uv treated drinking water we implemented the photorepair fluence based qmra to determine risk of infection after uv disinfection due to potential photorepair and regrowth risk of infection was calculated for different water treatment and collection scenarios with various model conditions such as source water contamination uv fluence solar intensity and container material we incorporated uncertainty of uv fluence response photorepair fluence response and pathogen dose response models in the qmra because they can lead to considerable variability in the calculated outcomes i e risk of infection the calculated risk is compared against established acceptable risk 1 in 10 000 donald et al 2011 we demonstrated the utility of the model by simulating a range of plausible water collection scenarios to calculate a distribution of risk of infection the model can also be used as a decision support tool for optimal placement of uv disinfection locations to minimize risk and maximize access to safe water 2 methods 2 1 application of qmra approach to perform the risk assessment a series of monte carlo simulations n 10 000 was performed by iterating through the framework of the photorepair qmra using a fluence based determination of photorepair fig 1 a point estimate was used for the initial concentration of microorganisms in untreated water and was reduced by the log10 inactivation from the uv fluence response model a bacterial photorepair model was used to determine the concentration of microorganisms in uv treated water after exposure to photorepair fluence during transport or storage the probability of infection or risk of infection was calculated via a dose response equation that requires a dose response parameter and ingested dose i e concentration volume this process was iterated to simulate the risk resulting in a distribution of risks risk scenarios were simulated via monte carlo using a combinations of model parameters table 1 that incorporate uncertainty of model inputs table 2 all data digitization was performed with webplotdigitizer rohatgi 2020 2 2 simulation of water collection and transport storage water collection was simulated to capture variability by generating 10 000 random pairs of water collection time tc and exposure time te that each represent a potential water collection trip table 1 water collection time accounts for the variability in solar intensity throughout the day and the exposure time represents the duration of light exposure after treatment we generated two different monte carlo simulation spaces hypothetical and culturally adapted 1 the hypothetical monte carlo simulation space represents all possible water collection trips defined by the uniform distributions of t c and t e table 1 2 the culturally adapted monte carlo simulation space represents a more typical water collection pattern based on water demand patterns in rural water distribution systems arnalich 2011 the culturally adapted monte carlo simulation space was used to account for societal and cultural impacts on water collection patterns cassivi et al 2019 2018 for example individuals in rural communities often collect water in the morning and late afternoon to avoid midday heat the bimodal distribution of the culturally adapted distribution was created by combining two normal distributions one for morning and afternoon using parameters described in table 1 additional details for this distribution can be found in supplemental text s1 2 3 pathogen selection and concentration e coli o157 h7 was selected as the model pathogen for this qmra non pathogenic e coli atcc 11229 was used as a model organism where there was insufficient data for o157 h7 non pathogenic e coli is used as an indicator organism for fecal contamination in water sources pathogenic strains of e coli such as o157 h7 cause diarrhea dehydration and even death especially among children and the immunocompromised clements et al 2012 kotloff 2017 qadri et al 2005 data for lp uv disinfection was available for both o157 h7 and atcc 11229 photorepair data for atcc 11229 and pathogen dose response data was available for o157 h7 the e coli o157 h7 dose response relationship used in this model was considered appropriate according to best practices in qmra weir 2013 statistically acceptable fit of original experimental dose response results similarity of human pathophysiology by the animal surrogate and infection rather than disease or symptoms as the response rose et al 2017 despite the use of multiple strains for the disinfection and photorepair kinetics atcc 11229 can serve as an appropriate indicator for an attenuated strain of o157 h7 quek and hu 2008a for the uniform distribution scenarios point estimates of pathogen concentration were used to represent various levels of contamination table 2 2 4 uv disinfection data on disinfection of e coli by low pressure lp uv lamps were screened from previously reviewed literature malayeri et al 2016 uv fluence responses were modelled for e coli strains atcc 11229 and o157 h7 fig s3 in the text we differentiate the fluence responses uv and photorepair from the pathogenic dose response specifically the phrase uv dose response was replaced with uv fluence response because dose is reserved for pathogen dose and dose response in qmra three uv fluences represented different levels of disinfection 8 16 and 40 mj cm2 8 mj cm2 was used in bohrerova and linden 2007 class b uv systems requiring 16 mj cm2 minimum are used in household point of use or small systems for treated water while 40 mj cm2 is the minimum for class a uv systems and commonly used for primary drinking water disinfection nsf 2012 to predict lp uv disinfection a four parameter log logistic function eq 1 was fitted to the disinfection data using the drm function from drc package version 3 0 1 in r studio this model was used because the relation between uv fluence and log10 inactivation is horizontally asymptotic geeraerd et al 2000 the top and bottom 95 confidence bounds of log10 inactivation values at 8 16 and 40 mj cm2 from the log logistic model were used to define uniform distributions for li table 1 1 l i 0 c d c 1 exp b log f l u e n c e log e 2 5 fluence based prediction of photorepair 2 5 1 solar data used to calculate photorepair fluence to enable the translation of laboratory photorepair fluence calculations wavelength weighted to the qmra for applied settings solar intensity data with wavelength resolution i e spectral solar irradiance and solar intensity were required photorepair fluence was calculated by weighting solar irradiance by wavelength dependent material transmittance and photorepair absorbance spectra we used two separate sources of solar data to capture sunlight intensity and wavelength 1 spectral solar irradiance ssi with units of µw m2 nm which we refer to as astm data the global tilt spectral irradiance values from the astm g 173 03 am1 5 global spectrum dataset www nrel org was used to represent the wavelength dependent intensity of sunlight at wavelengths from 280 to 4000 nm 2 daily solar irradiance dsi solar irradiance profiles were obtained from www pveducation org which we refer to as pv data the profiles included values of total irradiance with units of kw m2 at 15 minute intervals for each day of the year solar irradiance profiles for day 1 90 and 180 at latitude 37 c were selected to represent three levels of light intensity low medium and high intensity respectively fig s1 2 5 2 modeling light transmittance for different materials the wavelength dependent light transmittance of water containers was accounted using transmittance spectra for various materials transmittance spectra from 250 to 450 nm for various plastic containers including polyethylene terephthalate pet polystyrene ps and polycarbonate pc polypropylene copolymer ppco and bpa free copolyester tritan were digitized from the literature fisher et al 2012 additional details for data processing are included supplementary text s2 and transmittance spectra of gatorade sevenup ice and aquafina bottles are shown fig s2 the spectra demonstrate that the solar wavelengths enabling sodis and photorepair will be able to pass through the plastic material 2 5 3 photolyase absorption spectrum for e coli photolyase the wavelength dependent nature of photorepair was represented by the absorption spectrum for the e fadh2 mthf form of photolyase in e coli bohrerova and linden 2007 payne and sancar 1990 the absorption spectrum for e coli photolyase was digitized normalized to the maximum absorption value at 384 nm and interpolated to yield relative absorption spectrum values between 0 and 1 for wavelengths from 300 to 500 nm pλ 2 5 4 calculating photorepair fluence wavelength dependent solar irradiance transmittance through material i λ was calculated at any wavelength of light λ using eq 2 where i 0 λ is the irradiance incident on the container surface and t m λ is the transmittance spectra of each material i e wavelength dependent transmittance total solar irradiance tsi was calculated by integrating spectral solar irradiance from 280 4000 nm eq 3 based on the astm data 2 i λ i 0 λ t m λ 3 tsi λ 0 280 nm λ n 4000 nm ss i λ d λ total photorepair irradiance tpi for each material was calculated by integrating the product of ssi t m λ and pλ for wavelengths 300 to 500 nm eq 4 for each material type the tpi was divided by the tsi to determine the weighted photorepair factor wpf eq 5 depiction of calculations in eqs 3 5 are shown in fig 2 4 tpi λ 300 nm λ 500 nm ssi t f m λ p λ d λ 5 wpf tpi tsi pv data was used to account for temporal aspects of solar irradiance impacted by time of year and time of day direct solar irradiance dsi was obtained from pv data for 3 separate days day 1 low intensity day 90 medium intensity and day 180 high intensity at latitude 37 n for each combination of tc and te the total direct fluence tdf was determined by calculating the area under the dsi curve between t1 tc and t2 tc tc eq 6 the area under the curve was approximated using the function integrate xy from the r package sfsmisc version 1 1 7 photorepair fluence for each material was calculated by multiplying the total direct fluence by the weighted photorepair factor wpf for each material eq 7 the calculations of eqs 6 and 7 are depicted in fig 3 6 tdf t 1 t c t 2 t c t e dsi dt 7 pf tdf wpf 2 6 prediction of photorepair photorepair fluence response data as log10 inactivation vs photorepair fluence was digitized from the literature bohrerova and linden 2007 and processed to obtain log10 reactivation lr by subtracting the observed log10 inactivation from the initial log10 inactivation e g 5 log10 inactivation 3 5 log10 inactivation 1 5 log10 reactivation change in microorganism concentration is termed reactivation to capture light dependent and independent repair processes because in the study it is indistinguishable from other types of regrowth e g natural regrowth dark repair photorepair fluence response data were fitted to a segmented linear regression model with 95 confidence intervals using r package segmented version 1 2 0 using 1500 mj cm2 as an initial guess for the breakpoint the top and bottom 95 confidence bounds of the segmented linear regression model were used to define uniform distributions for log10 reactivation lr at integer values of photorepair fluence from 0 to 6000 mj cm2 and randomly sampled once to obtain a value for lr that was used to estimate photorepair for both monte carlo simulation spaces supplemental data d1 2 7 exposure and risk of infection the qmra algorithm was used to calculate risk of infection for each pair of tc and te in the uniform and hypothetical monte carlo simulation spaces different scenarios were simulated by changing inputs for the steps of the photorepair qmra algorithm e g concentration solar intensity uv fluence material to determine exposure to microorganisms the log10 concentration of microorganisms ingested cing was calculated using eq 8 where c0 is the initial log10 concentration water ingestion v 1 l was assumed to occur immediately following light exposure the dose of e coli o157 h7 ingested d was calculated with eq 9 the exponential dose response relationship described in eq 10 was used to calculate probability of infection pi or risk of infection haas et al 2000 the dose response parameter kd was simulated for each monte carlo simulation by randomly sampling from a uniform distribution defined by the top and bottom 95 confidence bounds of the optimized exponential dose response model weir 2013 to yield 10 000 possible values table 2 risk of infection was also calculated for non photorepair scenarios or point of use uv disinfection using combinations of various initial concentrations of microorganism and uv fluences of 8 16 and 40 mj cm2 8 c ing c 0 li lr 9 d 10 c i n g v 10 p i 1 e k d d 2 8 sensitivity analysis to evaluate the impact of each variable on the resultant risk sensitivity analysis was performed to compare the distribution of outcomes for each scenario with 10 000 outcomes the risk assessments performed using the hypothetical monte carlo simulation space consisted of 4 variables initial concentration solar intensity uv fluence and material which had 3 3 3 and 9 different levels each respectively the risk assessment performed using the culturally adapted monte carlo simulation space consisted of one variable initial concentration the risk assessment for non photorepair consisted of two variables initial concentration and uv fluence the percentiles and cumulative distribution functions were calculated and plotted in r studio r version 4 0 1 spearman rank correlation coefficient was used to assess the influence of variation in variables on pi chen et al 2021 hamilton et al 2006 correlation coefficient values of 0 indicate no influence and values of 1 or 1 indicate complete dependence of that input variable model outputs were ranked by correlation coefficient with pi a 3 results 3 1 risk assessment scenarios fifteen unique photorepair scenarios were simulated for the hypothetical simulation space using three initial concentrations three uv fluences nine different material types and three sunlight intensity photorepair conditions three photorepair scenarios were simulated for the culturally adapted simulation space fifteen point of use scenarios were simulated to represent non photorepair uv disinfection conditions all photorepair simulation spaces were plotted to visualize trends the variable conditions for all scenarios are summarized in table s2 3 2 uv fluence response the four parameter log logistic model fitted to the combined e coli atcc 11229 and o157 h7 uv fluence response data had parameter estimates standard error were b 2 309 0 571 c 0 manually set d 6 423 0 688 and e 5 499 0 629 fig s3 tailing was observed in the uv fluence response model after 12 mj cm2 the predicted log10 inactivation at doses of 8 16 and 40 mj cm2 were 4 52 5 92 and 6 35 respectively with 95 confidence top and bottom bounds reported in table 1 3 3 calculation of photorepair fluence photorepair fluence was simulated for each scenario so that log10 reactivation could be predicted using the photorepair fluence kinetic model the total solar irradiance calculated from the astm data was 1 0029 kw m2 from 280 to 4000 nm the calculated wpf values obtained from eq 7 for each material were pet 0 04207 pc 0 04591 ps 0 04588 ppco 0 03521 tritan 0 04499 gatorade 0 04269 aquafina 0 04602 sevenup 0 02971 and ice 0 04496 the maximum total direct fluence values for high medium and low solar intensity were 128 680 123 348 and 102 957 mj cm2 respectively the distributions of total direct fluences are shown in fig s4 maximum photorepair fluences for combinations of material and solar intensity ranged from 3665 to 5910 mj cm2 3 4 photorepair fluence response the segmented linear regression model fig s6 fitted to the photorepair fluence response data had parameter estimates of kr 0 00204 standard error 0 0001877 and ki 0 00043 standard error 0 000218 log10 inactivation cm2 mj 1 for the reactivation and inactivation rate constants respectively where adjusted r2 0 93 the breakpoint was 1346 standard error 136 mj cm2 the upper and lower 95 confidence interval values of the segmented regression model were used to bound the uniform distribution for predicting log reactivation table 1 3 5 risk of infection without photorepair the risk of infection was analyzed for uv disinfection scenarios without photorepair e g point of use uv disinfection mean risk of infection were 1 in 10 000 except for 8 mj cm2 and initial concentration 10 000 cfu l table st1 these results demonstrate that uv disinfection is effective for point of use water disinfection for 16 and 40 mj cm2 and initial concentrations less than 10 000 cfu l 3 6 risk of infection with photorepair our results show the temporal distribution of the risk of infection for each scenario the uniform monte carlo simulation space includes all the outcomes calculated for different conditions described by the variables concentration uv fluence solar intensity and container material fig 4 based on the photorepair fluence response model the greatest risk of infection was expected at the break point of the segmented linear regression model temporal trends for all plotted simulation spaces show that the maximum values of risk of infection were between 10 4 and 10 3 and occurred at 1 to 1 25 h fig 4 the overall trends show that mean risk of infection for all simulated scenarios is less than 1 in 10 000 fig 5 when varying initial concentrations no outcomes exceeded the 1 in 10 000 risk level at initial concentrations of 1 and 10 cfu l only initial concentrations greater than 100 cfu l showed outcomes that exceeded the 1 in 10 000 risk fig 4a the mean risk of infection for 10 000 simulations for the scenario with 10 000 cfu l was the only scenario where the mean risk exceeded 1 in 10 000 fig 5a as solar intensity and daylight hours increased the temporal risk profile also widened fig 4b additionally the number of risks exceeding 1 in 10 000 increased as solar intensity increased fig 4b the distribution of outcomes for medium and high intensity were more similar to one another than those of low intensity fig 5b which suggests a solar intensity threshold above which risk of photorepair does not increase dramatically increasing the uv fluence from 8 to 16 or 40 mj cm2 decreased the number of exceedances of the acceptable risk fig 4c where 8 mj cm2 had the most outcomes exceeding 1 in 10 000 risk figs 5c and s6c mean risk of all scenarios at 8 mj cm2 was 2 2 5 times greater than the mean risk for 16 and 40 mj cm2 fig 5c several model simulations exceeding 1 in 10 000 for 40 mj cm2 demonstrate that the uncertainty and variability of uv fluence response and photorepair fluence impact the risk calculation material type and differences in material transmittance spectra did not contribute to differences in simulated outcomes fig 4d the calculated weighted photorepair factors for the nine material types were between 0 029 0 046 but observed means and distributions of risk of infection were similar across material types figs 5d and s6d these results suggest the difference in material transmittance contributed little to variability in the risk assessment outcomes a more representative water collection scenario was simulated by the culturally adapted monte carlo simulation space fig 6 a where the maximum exposure time was around 30 min the culturally adapted simulation space reflected community water collection practices such as fetching water during either the morning or late afternoon as seen by the two peaks fig 6a exceedances of the acceptable risk were observed except for the simulations with initial concentration of 100 cfu l figure s the risk is the worst case scenario of 10 000 microorganisms l showed that photorepair risk was the greatest between 15 and 30 min which aligns with the peak photorepair of e coli at 15 min with model conditions closest to the experimental conditions bohrerova and linden 2007 3 7 sensitivity analysis for qmra results the sensitivity analyses of pi to randomly sampled input variables for the eighteen photorepair scenarios are summarized in tornado graphs fig s8 for all scenarios microorganism dose had the greatest impact on risk results followed by log reactivation and photorepair fluence values sensitivity analysis indicated that photorepair fluence of ppco and sevenup materials had greater impact on pi correlation compared with other materials fig s8 sensitivity analysis also showed that decreasing sunlight intensity increased the impact of photorepair fluence on pi these results suggest that the method of photorepair fluence calculation will have the greatest impact on the modeling of bacteria regrowth and repair and the subsequent risk of infection therefore the standardized method of photorepair fluence calculation bohrerova and linden 2007 should be adopted more consistently by future studies 4 discussion 4 1 community water collection dynamics an ideal target range of no more than 30 60 min would minimize socioeconomic and health impacts of water collection gurung et al 2019 nygren et al 2016 pickering and davis 2012 this target range also aligns with the recommended time of 30 min to increase water accessibility in developing countries especially those without piped water cassivi et al 2018 water collection patterns suggested by this qmra to minimize risk of transporting uv treated water fig 6 are within this target as well in situations where travel time 30 min are not possible risk can be minimized by collecting water at the extremes of the day i e early morning and late evening to avoid photorepair exposure fig 4a for travel times 2 h sodis may counteract the impact of photorepair fig 4 when simulating a smaller range of exposure times in the culturally adapted simulation space scenarios 16 18 compared to the hypothetical simulation space i e maximum of 0 5 vs 3 5 h the input variables with greatest impact on risk were microorganism dose and uv fluence fig s8 4 2 source contamination lower initial microorganism concentrations in source water prior to treatment were observed to have lower risk of infection fig 5a our result is consistent with previous drinking water qmra studies that demonstrate initial concentration is a critical qmra variable blokker et al 2018 schijven et al 2019 supporting prioritization of source water protection additionally we used point estimates to model contamination for hypothetical scenarios which may not be representative of certain contexts contamination can be unequally distributed petterson 2016 can be unpredictable due to environmental factors such as proximity to agricultural fields presence of sewage warm weather seasonality microbial contamination of soil water source type and precipitation ashbolt 2015 kostyla et al 2015 reynolds et al 2020 whitman et al 2006 and can go undetected in circumstances with limited testing resources arcipowski et al 2017 petterson 2016 additional factors that may impact risk but were not included in the model include potential recontamination between treatment and consumption biofilm formation and pathogen regrowth in water containers and efficacy of container sterilization and cleanliness of containers in practice health risks such as diarrheal disease can also be reduced by following guidelines for safe water storage at the household level who 2019 this quantitative health based risk assessment of photorepair after low pressure uv disinfection of drinking water indicates a one hour maximum travel time to maintain acceptable risk fig 4 however risk estimates from our model are conservative because bacterial concentration in water sources is generally orders of magnitude lower than initial cell concentrations in bench scale uv studies used to model disinfection and photorepair here and typical uv disinfection doses of 16 and 40 mj cm2 achieve 4 log inactivation 4 3 pathogen dose response e coli o157 h7 is a conservative organism for this qmra with high infectivity compared to other microorganisms who 2017 the exponential dose response model for e coli used in this qmra yields a greater risk than the beta poisson model enger 2015 the effect of bacterial strain on uv disinfection kinetics also impacts the pathogen dose response model results our pathogen dose response model organism e coli o157 h7 exhibits greater sensitivity to lp uv disinfection compared to atcc 11229 disinfection model organism and thus incorporates conservatism in our risk estimates fig s3 bacterial strain can also affect photorepair disinfection kinetics for example at lp uv fluences of 5 and 8 mj cm2 maximum photorepair was observed after 1 hour in e coli o157 h7 versus after 2 h for e coli atcc 11229 zimmer and slawson 2002 aspects of infection not considered in this study were potential differences in recovery of infectivity rather than cultivability after photorepair and variability in attack rates to different populations e g elderly immunocompromised children while only one pathogen was used for this microbial risk assessment future risk assessments can integrate the photorepair kinetics of alternative pathogens using the framework provided by this study uv and photorepair fluence response kinetics of non culturable bacteria can be potentially quantified by molecular techniques weigel et al 2017 4 4 uv disinfection microbial repair decreases with increasing uv fluence and inactivation li et al 2017 nebot sanz et al 2007 nyangaresi et al 2018 vélez colmenares et al 2012 although our results indicate that concentration impacted risk fig 5c the qmra model did not account for potential concentration impacts on disinfection kinetics and regrowth of survivors where cell regrowth and reproduction can be aided by nutrients from cells lysed during uv disinfection bohrerova et al 2015 chen et al 2020 kollu and örmeci 2015 in practice while standalone uv disinfection does not provide residual disinfection novel uv applications that disrupt dna repair nyangaresi et al 2019 2018 song et al 2019 or combined with a residual disinfectant can minimize pathogen regrowth mofidi and linden 2004 sensitivity analysis results indicated that increasing the uv fluence led to decreased correlation between uv fluence scenario 1 6 7 and risk outcomes fig s8 which may be explained by the greater levels of inactivation by the higher uv fluence and the tailing effect 4 5 light and material characteristics the propagation of uv and visible light through mediums is complex and requires accurate representations of optical characteristics and geometry that were mathematically simplified to develop this qmra model geometry impacts on irradiance distribution throughout the water matrix were considered negligible with the assumption of high uv transmittance castro alférez et al 2018 however geometry e g water depth and volume of the container would decrease the calculated photorepair fluence compared to photorepair fluence in laboratory studies where small petri dishes are used for irradiating samples schmidtlein et al 2015 for larger volumes this study observed less solar disinfection and slower repair compared with smaller volumes 7000 ml containers vs 50 ml petri dishes our study used photoreactivation data from bohrerova and linden 2007 so our model results compared to more realistic decentralized water users and container sizes would reflect higher solar disinfection and less repair than would be expected in a decentralized water supply again contributing to the conservativeness of our risk results therefore risk estimates calculated in this qmra are conservative because we translated photorepair results from petri dishes to larger and enclosed containers for example photorepair saturated around 15 min for samples under direct sunlight exposure in petri dishes bohrerova and linden 2007 but saturated at 60 min in this qmra fig 4 this difference can be attributed to the container attenuating sunlight intensity water quality and material impacts on light scattering can also reduce the calculated photorepair fluence but were not considered different container materials such as plastic bottles glass bottles earthenware plastic bags also affect light transmittance borde et al 2016 castro alférez et al 2018 figueredo fernández et al 2017 keogh et al 2015 sciacca et al 2011 wegelin et al 2001 although more opaque containers with minimal wpf transmit less uv a wavelengths that induce photorepair differences among plastics were found to have weak to moderate correlation to risk figs 4d s8 scenario 1 and 8 15 this qmra only considered sunlight at a single latitude but the model can be expanded to account for spatial and temporal differences in solar intensity jeon et al 2022 sunlight discontinuities e g changes in cloud cover and thermal impacts of sodis castro alférez et al 2017 4 6 modeling photorepair and regrowth the segmented photorepair fluence model used in our study reflects how uv a light causes both photorepair and solar inactivation oguma et al 2004 but the model is not able to separate the effects of these concurrent processes the hypothesis that accumulated fluence must reach a threshold before measurable inactivation effect is observed dejung et al 2007 can explain the sudden breakpoint in the segmented photorepair fluence response model thus the threshold fluence represents the fluence after which dna repair mechanisms are overwhelmed by the damage caused by solar inactivation mcguigan et al 2012 the lag to achieve this threshold fluence may cause the shouldering effect in solar inactivation geeraerd et al 2000 and could explain why photorepair is more prominent before the threshold photorepair fluence while inactivation is more prominent after the threshold the correlation of intensity of sunlight to the risk results increased as intensity decreased from high scenario 1 to medium scenario 4 to low intensity scenario 5 fig s8 this result indicates that photorepair risks have greater association with low sunlight intensity and low photorepair fluence which both favor photorepair over sodis sensitivity analysis results suggest that the estimated log reactivation and the photorepair fluence were the second and third most impactful variables respectively in the risk assessment model fig s8 indicating the importance of reproducibility and accuracy in calculating the photorepair fluence for this qmra model because data for fluence based determination of photorepair was obtained from a single study uncertainty related to molecular repair in photorepair fluence response kinetics fig s5 was captured using a distribution of values from model confidence intervals instead of singular points from the model table 1 simplifications at the microorganism and molecular level were also used to develop this qmra model at the microorganism level the photorepair response of one strain of e coli would not provide a complete picture of photorepair for all potential pathogens of concern in drinking water such as mycobacteria bohrerova and linden 2006 and fungal spores wen et al 2018 at the molecular level the characteristics and behavior of the photolyase enzyme in e coli were simplified due to data limitations due to close agreement between absorption and action spectrum of photolyase payne and sancar 1990 we assumed absorption of photorepair light resulted in a one to one translation between photorepair and photoreactivation leading to conservative risk estimates additionally while temperature and water quality were previously observed to impact the regrowth of e coli quek and hu 2008b shafaei et al 2017 these factors were not included in the current model but can be included in future qmra using the framework provided in this study additional future risk assessments may consider incorporating modeling bacterial photorepair and regrowth in holding ponds receiving uv treated wastewater effluent especially considering the increasing use of uv disinfection in indirect potable reuse such risk assessments should include estimations of holding pond concentrations pathogen loading mixing in the water matrix and water depth i e geometry impacts on solar intensity 5 conclusion according to this qmra model developed to calculate photorepair fluence and assess risk for photorepair during transport of drinking water from decentralized uv treatment systems the main factors impacting risk were initial source water contamination pathogen dose and uv fluence the calculation of photorepair fluence was also a critical aspect of the qmra model results and was primarily impacted by sunlight intensity the weighted photorepair factor value water collection time and exposure time slight differences in container material transmittance characteristics had little impact on risk of infection but opaque materials to transport and store water treated by uv will minimize photorepair competing kinetics of photorepair and solar disinfection introduce complexity into determining an appropriate window of time that uv treated water is safe to drink photorepair exposure should not exceed 45 60 min to achieve risk 1 in 10 000 when uv fluence 16 mj cm2 and contamination is 100 microorganisms l and these results emphasize source water protection and designing systems to ensure minimum uv fluence of 16 mj cm2 this qmra can be used to inform the placement of uv treated drinking water access points to reduce risk of photorepair and ensure safe drinking water our model can be used by wash practitioners to assess risk in decentralized drinking water distribution systems author contributions dm conceptualization data collection model development manuscript original draft

15110,ultraviolet disinfection is a promising solution for decentralized drinking water systems such as communal water taps a potential health risk is enzymatic photorepair of pathogens after uv disinfection which can result in regrowth of pathogens even though photorepair is a known issue no formal risk assessments have been conducted for photorepair after uv disinfection in drinking water the main objective was to construct a quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra of photorepair after uv disinfection of drinking water in a decentralized system uv disinfection and photorepair kinetics for e coli were modelled using reproducible fluence based determinations impacts of water collection patterns and wavelength dependent water container material transmittance sunlight intensity and photorepair enzyme absorbance were quantified after uv disinfection by 16 or 40 mj cm2 of 5 log microorganisms per l risk of infection did not exceed 1 in 10 000 under conditions permitting e coli photorepair risk from photorepair was less than 1 in 10 000 for photorepair light exposure 0 75 h throughout the day for uv fluence 16 mj cm2 or greater uv disinfection followed by solar disinfection surpassing photoreactivation during storage reduced risk below 1 in 10 000 for photorepair light exposure 2 5 h between modelled times of 9 am 3 pm the model can be expanded to other pathogens as uv fluence and photorepair fluence response kinetics become available and this qmra can be used to inform the placement of community water access points to reduce risk of photorepair and ensure adequate shelf life of uv disinfected water under safe storage conditions graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords uv disinfection qmra photorepair decentralized uv

causes nearly 829 000 preventable deaths annually who 2022 communities in rural remote and resource limited settings in the majority world commonly lack access to safely managed drinking water services such as treated water and piped water carter et al 1999 lee and schwab 2005 mattos et al 2021 contaminated water and lack of piped water systems force communities to adopt water consumption patterns that center on consuming packaged water distributed in containers such as plastic bottles or bags from communal water taps or water vendors vedachalam et al 2017 despite water treatment packaged water may still be microbially unsafe due to ineffective treatment re contamination or bacterial regrowth and repair during storage or transport cerna cortes et al 2019 diduch et al 2013 pant et al 2016 shahryari et al 2020 williams et al 2015 ultraviolet uv disinfection is a well established drinking water disinfection method and does not require adding chemicals to water which could result in formation of disinfection byproducts or adverse impacts on taste and odor dietrich and burlingame 2020 rossiter et al 2010 sharma and bhattacharya 2017 uv disinfection technology may provide socially and culturally appropriate solutions in developing regions of the world where the perception of chemically induced taste and odor in drinking water may deter people from consuming water that is otherwise safe crider et al 2018 goldhar et al 2013 lui et al 2014 yu jeco et al 2019 uv disinfection treats water by inducing dna damage to inactivate microorganisms and prevent them from carrying out metabolic activities such as replication and renders them unable to cause infection usepa 2006 a limitation to uv disinfection is that microorganisms such as bacteria possess intrinsic mechanisms that repair uv induced damage to dna two well known mechanisms of dna repair are photorepair and dark repair which are light dependent and light independent processes respectively sinha and häder 2002 photorepair is mediated by the photolyase enzyme which is activated by light between 300 and 500 nm kelner 1951 sancar et al 1987 sunlight and indoor light that emit wavelengths of light known to activate photolyase can potentially lead to photorepair when uv disinfected water is stored or transported indoors and outdoors following photorepair of dna microorganisms can potentially recover metabolic activity and the ability to cause infection also known as photoreactivation while photoreactivation is a known concern in uv treated drinking water hu et al 2012 kashamida et al 1996 sommer et al 2000 zimmer and slawson 2002 no formal health risk assessment has yet been performed quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra is powerful analytical framework used for evaluating microbial risks in drinking water blokker et al 2018 enger et al 2013 owens et al 2020 petterson and ashbolt 2016 schijven et al 2019 smeets et al 2009 as a photochemical treatment process uv disinfection does not physically remove bacteria from water therefore any observed increases in microorganism concentration in uv treated samples after exposure to photorepair light could be attributed to any combination of photorepair of dna photoreactivation of bacterial cells natural regrowth and dark repair bohrerova et al 2015 jungfer et al 2007 kollu and örmeci 2015 instead of using time based determinations of photorepair more precise and reproducible fluence based determination of photorepair dose should be used to account for light intensity and water characteristics and enable translation between studies and to applied settings bohrerova and linden 2007 schmidtlein et al 2015 shafaei et al 2017 here we demonstrate translation from laboratory photorepair results to informing risk based water system planning the purpose of this study was to construct a qmra model and use it for calculating the risk of infection from pathogens in packaged drinking water due to photorepair following uv disinfection qmra has not yet been conducted to assess risk of photorepair in uv treated drinking water we implemented the photorepair fluence based qmra to determine risk of infection after uv disinfection due to potential photorepair and regrowth risk of infection was calculated for different water treatment and collection scenarios with various model conditions such as source water contamination uv fluence solar intensity and container material we incorporated uncertainty of uv fluence response photorepair fluence response and pathogen dose response models in the qmra because they can lead to considerable variability in the calculated outcomes i e risk of infection the calculated risk is compared against established acceptable risk 1 in 10 000 donald et al 2011 we demonstrated the utility of the model by simulating a range of plausible water collection scenarios to calculate a distribution of risk of infection the model can also be used as a decision support tool for optimal placement of uv disinfection locations to minimize risk and maximize access to safe water 2 methods 2 1 application of qmra approach to perform the risk assessment a series of monte carlo simulations n 10 000 was performed by iterating through the framework of the photorepair qmra using a fluence based determination of photorepair fig 1 a point estimate was used for the initial concentration of microorganisms in untreated water and was reduced by the log10 inactivation from the uv fluence response model a bacterial photorepair model was used to determine the concentration of microorganisms in uv treated water after exposure to photorepair fluence during transport or storage the probability of infection or risk of infection was calculated via a dose response equation that requires a dose response parameter and ingested dose i e concentration volume this process was iterated to simulate the risk resulting in a distribution of risks risk scenarios were simulated via monte carlo using a combinations of model parameters table 1 that incorporate uncertainty of model inputs table 2 all data digitization was performed with webplotdigitizer rohatgi 2020 2 2 simulation of water collection and transport storage water collection was simulated to capture variability by generating 10 000 random pairs of water collection time tc and exposure time te that each represent a potential water collection trip table 1 water collection time accounts for the variability in solar intensity throughout the day and the exposure time represents the duration of light exposure after treatment we generated two different monte carlo simulation spaces hypothetical and culturally adapted 1 the hypothetical monte carlo simulation space represents all possible water collection trips defined by the uniform distributions of t c and t e table 1 2 the culturally adapted monte carlo simulation space represents a more typical water collection pattern based on water demand patterns in rural water distribution systems arnalich 2011 the culturally adapted monte carlo simulation space was used to account for societal and cultural impacts on water collection patterns cassivi et al 2019 2018 for example individuals in rural communities often collect water in the morning and late afternoon to avoid midday heat the bimodal distribution of the culturally adapted distribution was created by combining two normal distributions one for morning and afternoon using parameters described in table 1 additional details for this distribution can be found in supplemental text s1 2 3 pathogen selection and concentration e coli o157 h7 was selected as the model pathogen for this qmra non pathogenic e coli atcc 11229 was used as a model organism where there was insufficient data for o157 h7 non pathogenic e coli is used as an indicator organism for fecal contamination in water sources pathogenic strains of e coli such as o157 h7 cause diarrhea dehydration and even death especially among children and the immunocompromised clements et al 2012 kotloff 2017 qadri et al 2005 data for lp uv disinfection was available for both o157 h7 and atcc 11229 photorepair data for atcc 11229 and pathogen dose response data was available for o157 h7 the e coli o157 h7 dose response relationship used in this model was considered appropriate according to best practices in qmra weir 2013 statistically acceptable fit of original experimental dose response results similarity of human pathophysiology by the animal surrogate and infection rather than disease or symptoms as the response rose et al 2017 despite the use of multiple strains for the disinfection and photorepair kinetics atcc 11229 can serve as an appropriate indicator for an attenuated strain of o157 h7 quek and hu 2008a for the uniform distribution scenarios point estimates of pathogen concentration were used to represent various levels of contamination table 2 2 4 uv disinfection data on disinfection of e coli by low pressure lp uv lamps were screened from previously reviewed literature malayeri et al 2016 uv fluence responses were modelled for e coli strains atcc 11229 and o157 h7 fig s3 in the text we differentiate the fluence responses uv and photorepair from the pathogenic dose response specifically the phrase uv dose response was replaced with uv fluence response because dose is reserved for pathogen dose and dose response in qmra three uv fluences represented different levels of disinfection 8 16 and 40 mj cm2 8 mj cm2 was used in bohrerova and linden 2007 class b uv systems requiring 16 mj cm2 minimum are used in household point of use or small systems for treated water while 40 mj cm2 is the minimum for class a uv systems and commonly used for primary drinking water disinfection nsf 2012 to predict lp uv disinfection a four parameter log logistic function eq 1 was fitted to the disinfection data using the drm function from drc package version 3 0 1 in r studio this model was used because the relation between uv fluence and log10 inactivation is horizontally asymptotic geeraerd et al 2000 the top and bottom 95 confidence bounds of log10 inactivation values at 8 16 and 40 mj cm2 from the log logistic model were used to define uniform distributions for li table 1 1 l i 0 c d c 1 exp b log f l u e n c e log e 2 5 fluence based prediction of photorepair 2 5 1 solar data used to calculate photorepair fluence to enable the translation of laboratory photorepair fluence calculations wavelength weighted to the qmra for applied settings solar intensity data with wavelength resolution i e spectral solar irradiance and solar intensity were required photorepair fluence was calculated by weighting solar irradiance by wavelength dependent material transmittance and photorepair absorbance spectra we used two separate sources of solar data to capture sunlight intensity and wavelength 1 spectral solar irradiance ssi with units of µw m2 nm which we refer to as astm data the global tilt spectral irradiance values from the astm g 173 03 am1 5 global spectrum dataset www nrel org was used to represent the wavelength dependent intensity of sunlight at wavelengths from 280 to 4000 nm 2 daily solar irradiance dsi solar irradiance profiles were obtained from www pveducation org which we refer to as pv data the profiles included values of total irradiance with units of kw m2 at 15 minute intervals for each day of the year solar irradiance profiles for day 1 90 and 180 at latitude 37 c were selected to represent three levels of light intensity low medium and high intensity respectively fig s1 2 5 2 modeling light transmittance for different materials the wavelength dependent light transmittance of water containers was accounted using transmittance spectra for various materials transmittance spectra from 250 to 450 nm for various plastic containers including polyethylene terephthalate pet polystyrene ps and polycarbonate pc polypropylene copolymer ppco and bpa free copolyester tritan were digitized from the literature fisher et al 2012 additional details for data processing are included supplementary text s2 and transmittance spectra of gatorade sevenup ice and aquafina bottles are shown fig s2 the spectra demonstrate that the solar wavelengths enabling sodis and photorepair will be able to pass through the plastic material 2 5 3 photolyase absorption spectrum for e coli photolyase the wavelength dependent nature of photorepair was represented by the absorption spectrum for the e fadh2 mthf form of photolyase in e coli bohrerova and linden 2007 payne and sancar 1990 the absorption spectrum for e coli photolyase was digitized normalized to the maximum absorption value at 384 nm and interpolated to yield relative absorption spectrum values between 0 and 1 for wavelengths from 300 to 500 nm pλ 2 5 4 calculating photorepair fluence wavelength dependent solar irradiance transmittance through material i λ was calculated at any wavelength of light λ using eq 2 where i 0 λ is the irradiance incident on the container surface and t m λ is the transmittance spectra of each material i e wavelength dependent transmittance total solar irradiance tsi was calculated by integrating spectral solar irradiance from 280 4000 nm eq 3 based on the astm data 2 i λ i 0 λ t m λ 3 tsi λ 0 280 nm λ n 4000 nm ss i λ d λ total photorepair irradiance tpi for each material was calculated by integrating the product of ssi t m λ and pλ for wavelengths 300 to 500 nm eq 4 for each material type the tpi was divided by the tsi to determine the weighted photorepair factor wpf eq 5 depiction of calculations in eqs 3 5 are shown in fig 2 4 tpi λ 300 nm λ 500 nm ssi t f m λ p λ d λ 5 wpf tpi tsi pv data was used to account for temporal aspects of solar irradiance impacted by time of year and time of day direct solar irradiance dsi was obtained from pv data for 3 separate days day 1 low intensity day 90 medium intensity and day 180 high intensity at latitude 37 n for each combination of tc and te the total direct fluence tdf was determined by calculating the area under the dsi curve between t1 tc and t2 tc tc eq 6 the area under the curve was approximated using the function integrate xy from the r package sfsmisc version 1 1 7 photorepair fluence for each material was calculated by multiplying the total direct fluence by the weighted photorepair factor wpf for each material eq 7 the calculations of eqs 6 and 7 are depicted in fig 3 6 tdf t 1 t c t 2 t c t e dsi dt 7 pf tdf wpf 2 6 prediction of photorepair photorepair fluence response data as log10 inactivation vs photorepair fluence was digitized from the literature bohrerova and linden 2007 and processed to obtain log10 reactivation lr by subtracting the observed log10 inactivation from the initial log10 inactivation e g 5 log10 inactivation 3 5 log10 inactivation 1 5 log10 reactivation change in microorganism concentration is termed reactivation to capture light dependent and independent repair processes because in the study it is indistinguishable from other types of regrowth e g natural regrowth dark repair photorepair fluence response data were fitted to a segmented linear regression model with 95 confidence intervals using r package segmented version 1 2 0 using 1500 mj cm2 as an initial guess for the breakpoint the top and bottom 95 confidence bounds of the segmented linear regression model were used to define uniform distributions for log10 reactivation lr at integer values of photorepair fluence from 0 to 6000 mj cm2 and randomly sampled once to obtain a value for lr that was used to estimate photorepair for both monte carlo simulation spaces supplemental data d1 2 7 exposure and risk of infection the qmra algorithm was used to calculate risk of infection for each pair of tc and te in the uniform and hypothetical monte carlo simulation spaces different scenarios were simulated by changing inputs for the steps of the photorepair qmra algorithm e g concentration solar intensity uv fluence material to determine exposure to microorganisms the log10 concentration of microorganisms ingested cing was calculated using eq 8 where c0 is the initial log10 concentration water ingestion v 1 l was assumed to occur immediately following light exposure the dose of e coli o157 h7 ingested d was calculated with eq 9 the exponential dose response relationship described in eq 10 was used to calculate probability of infection pi or risk of infection haas et al 2000 the dose response parameter kd was simulated for each monte carlo simulation by randomly sampling from a uniform distribution defined by the top and bottom 95 confidence bounds of the optimized exponential dose response model weir 2013 to yield 10 000 possible values table 2 risk of infection was also calculated for non photorepair scenarios or point of use uv disinfection using combinations of various initial concentrations of microorganism and uv fluences of 8 16 and 40 mj cm2 8 c ing c 0 li lr 9 d 10 c i n g v 10 p i 1 e k d d 2 8 sensitivity analysis to evaluate the impact of each variable on the resultant risk sensitivity analysis was performed to compare the distribution of outcomes for each scenario with 10 000 outcomes the risk assessments performed using the hypothetical monte carlo simulation space consisted of 4 variables initial concentration solar intensity uv fluence and material which had 3 3 3 and 9 different levels each respectively the risk assessment performed using the culturally adapted monte carlo simulation space consisted of one variable initial concentration the risk assessment for non photorepair consisted of two variables initial concentration and uv fluence the percentiles and cumulative distribution functions were calculated and plotted in r studio r version 4 0 1 spearman rank correlation coefficient was used to assess the influence of variation in variables on pi chen et al 2021 hamilton et al 2006 correlation coefficient values of 0 indicate no influence and values of 1 or 1 indicate complete dependence of that input variable model outputs were ranked by correlation coefficient with pi a 3 results 3 1 risk assessment scenarios fifteen unique photorepair scenarios were simulated for the hypothetical simulation space using three initial concentrations three uv fluences nine different material types and three sunlight intensity photorepair conditions three photorepair scenarios were simulated for the culturally adapted simulation space fifteen point of use scenarios were simulated to represent non photorepair uv disinfection conditions all photorepair simulation spaces were plotted to visualize trends the variable conditions for all scenarios are summarized in table s2 3 2 uv fluence response the four parameter log logistic model fitted to the combined e coli atcc 11229 and o157 h7 uv fluence response data had parameter estimates standard

and 40 mj cm2 were 4 52 5 92 and 6 35 respectively with 95 confidence top and bottom bounds reported in table 1 3 3 calculation of photorepair fluence photorepair fluence was simulated for each scenario so that log10 reactivation could be predicted using the photorepair fluence kinetic model the total solar irradiance calculated from the astm data was 1 0029 kw m2 from 280 to 4000 nm the calculated wpf values obtained from eq 7 for each material were pet 0 04207 pc 0 04591 ps 0 04588 ppco 0 03521 tritan 0 04499 gatorade 0 04269 aquafina 0 04602 sevenup 0 02971 and ice 0 04496 the maximum total direct fluence values for high medium and low solar intensity were 128 680 123 348 and 102 957 mj cm2 respectively the distributions of total direct fluences are shown in fig s4 maximum photorepair fluences for combinations of material and solar intensity ranged from 3665 to 5910 mj cm2 3 4 photorepair fluence response the segmented linear regression model fig s6 fitted to the photorepair fluence response data had parameter estimates of kr 0 00204 standard error 0 0001877 and ki 0 00043 standard error 0 000218 log10 inactivation cm2 mj 1 for the reactivation and inactivation rate constants respectively where adjusted r2 0 93 the breakpoint was 1346 standard error 136 mj cm2 the upper and lower 95 confidence interval values of the segmented regression model were used to bound the uniform distribution for predicting log reactivation table 1 3 5 risk of infection without photorepair the risk of infection was analyzed for uv disinfection scenarios without photorepair e g point of use uv disinfection mean risk of infection were 1 in 10 000 except for 8 mj cm2 and initial concentration 10 000 cfu l table st1 these results demonstrate that uv disinfection is effective for point of use water disinfection for 16 and 40 mj cm2 and initial concentrations less than 10 000 cfu l 3 6 risk of infection with photorepair our results show the temporal distribution of the risk of infection for each scenario the uniform monte carlo simulation space includes all the outcomes calculated for different conditions described by the variables concentration uv fluence solar intensity and container material fig 4 based on the photorepair fluence response model the greatest risk of infection was expected at the break point of the segmented linear regression model temporal trends for all plotted simulation spaces show that the maximum values of risk of infection were between 10 4 and 10 3 and occurred at 1 to 1 25 h fig 4 the overall trends show that mean risk of infection for all simulated scenarios is less than 1 in 10 000 fig 5 when varying initial concentrations no outcomes exceeded the 1 in 10 000 risk level at initial concentrations of 1 and 10 cfu l only initial concentrations greater than 100 cfu l showed outcomes that exceeded the 1 in 10 000 risk fig 4a the mean risk of infection for 10 000 simulations for the scenario with 10 000 cfu l was the only scenario where the mean risk exceeded 1 in 10 000 fig 5a as solar intensity and daylight hours increased the temporal risk profile also widened fig 4b additionally the number of risks exceeding 1 in 10 000 increased as solar intensity increased fig 4b the distribution of outcomes for medium and high intensity were more similar to one another than those of low intensity fig 5b which suggests a solar intensity threshold above which risk of photorepair does not increase dramatically increasing the uv fluence from 8 to 16 or 40 mj cm2 decreased the number of exceedances of the acceptable risk fig 4c where 8 mj cm2 had the most outcomes exceeding 1 in 10 000 risk figs 5c and s6c mean risk of all scenarios at 8 mj cm2 was 2 2 5 times greater than the mean risk for 16 and 40 mj cm2 fig 5c several model simulations exceeding 1 in 10 000 for 40 mj cm2 demonstrate that the uncertainty and variability of uv fluence response and photorepair fluence impact the risk calculation material type and differences in material transmittance spectra did not contribute to differences in simulated outcomes fig 4d the calculated weighted photorepair factors for the nine material types were between 0 029 0 046 but observed means and distributions of risk of infection were similar across material types figs 5d and s6d these results suggest the difference in material transmittance contributed little to variability in the risk assessment outcomes a more representative water collection scenario was simulated by the culturally adapted monte carlo simulation space fig 6 a where the maximum exposure time was around 30 min the culturally adapted simulation space reflected community water collection practices such as fetching water during either the morning or late afternoon as seen by the two peaks fig 6a exceedances of the acceptable risk were observed except for the simulations with initial concentration of 100 cfu l figure s the risk is the worst case scenario of 10 000 microorganisms l showed that photorepair risk was the greatest between 15 and 30 min which aligns with the peak photorepair of e coli at 15 min with model conditions closest to the experimental conditions bohrerova and linden 2007 3 7 sensitivity analysis for qmra results the sensitivity analyses of pi to randomly sampled input variables for the eighteen photorepair scenarios are summarized in tornado graphs fig s8 for all scenarios microorganism dose had the greatest impact on risk results followed by log reactivation and photorepair fluence values sensitivity analysis indicated that photorepair fluence of ppco and sevenup materials had greater impact on pi correlation compared with other materials fig s8 sensitivity analysis also showed that decreasing sunlight intensity increased the impact of photorepair fluence on pi these results suggest that the method of photorepair fluence calculation will have the greatest impact on the modeling of bacteria regrowth and repair and the subsequent risk of infection therefore the standardized method of photorepair fluence calculation bohrerova and linden 2007 should be adopted more consistently by future studies 4 discussion 4 1 community water collection dynamics an ideal target range of no more than 30 60 min would minimize socioeconomic and health impacts of water collection gurung et al 2019 nygren et al 2016 pickering and davis 2012 this target range also aligns with the recommended time of 30 min to increase water accessibility in developing countries especially those without piped water cassivi et al 2018 water collection patterns suggested by this qmra to minimize risk of transporting uv treated water fig 6 are within this target as well in situations where travel time 30 min are not possible risk can be minimized by collecting water at the extremes of the day i e early morning and late evening to avoid photorepair exposure fig 4a for travel times 2 h sodis may counteract the impact of photorepair fig 4 when simulating a smaller range of exposure times in the culturally adapted simulation space scenarios 16 18 compared to the hypothetical simulation space i e maximum of 0 5 vs 3 5 h the input variables with greatest impact on risk were microorganism dose and uv fluence fig s8 4 2 source contamination lower initial microorganism concentrations in source water prior to treatment were observed to have lower risk of infection fig 5a our result is consistent with previous drinking water qmra studies that demonstrate initial concentration is a critical qmra variable blokker et al 2018 schijven et al 2019 supporting prioritization of source water protection additionally we used point estimates to model contamination for hypothetical scenarios which may not be representative of certain contexts contamination can be unequally distributed petterson 2016 can be unpredictable due to environmental factors such as proximity to agricultural fields presence of sewage warm weather seasonality microbial contamination of soil water source type and precipitation ashbolt 2015 kostyla et al 2015 reynolds et al 2020 whitman et al 2006 and can go undetected in circumstances with limited testing resources arcipowski et al 2017 petterson 2016 additional factors that may impact risk but were not included in the model include potential recontamination between treatment and consumption biofilm formation and pathogen regrowth in water containers and efficacy of container sterilization and cleanliness of containers in practice health risks such as diarrheal disease can also be reduced by following guidelines for safe water storage at the household level who 2019 this quantitative health based risk assessment of photorepair after low pressure uv disinfection of drinking water indicates a one hour maximum travel time to maintain acceptable risk fig 4 however risk estimates from our model are conservative because bacterial concentration in water sources is generally orders of magnitude lower than initial cell concentrations in bench scale uv studies used to model disinfection and photorepair here and typical uv disinfection doses of 16 and 40 mj cm2 achieve 4 log inactivation 4 3 pathogen dose response e coli o157 h7 is a conservative organism for this qmra with high infectivity compared to other microorganisms who 2017 the exponential dose response model for e coli used in this qmra yields a greater risk than the beta poisson model enger 2015 the effect of bacterial strain on uv disinfection kinetics also impacts the pathogen dose response model results our pathogen dose response model organism e coli o157 h7 exhibits greater sensitivity to lp uv disinfection compared to atcc 11229 disinfection model organism and thus incorporates conservatism in our risk estimates fig s3 bacterial strain can also affect photorepair disinfection kinetics for example at lp uv fluences of 5 and 8 mj cm2 maximum photorepair was observed after 1 hour in e coli o157 h7 versus after 2 h for e coli atcc 11229 zimmer and slawson 2002 aspects of infection not considered in this study were potential differences in recovery of infectivity rather than cultivability after photorepair and variability in attack rates to different populations e g elderly immunocompromised children while only one pathogen was used for this microbial risk assessment future risk assessments can integrate the photorepair kinetics of alternative pathogens using the framework provided by this study uv and photorepair fluence response kinetics of non culturable bacteria can be potentially quantified by molecular techniques weigel et al 2017 4 4 uv disinfection microbial repair decreases with increasing uv fluence and inactivation li et al 2017 nebot sanz et al 2007 nyangaresi et al 2018 vélez colmenares et al 2012 although our results indicate that concentration impacted risk fig 5c the qmra model did not account for potential concentration impacts on disinfection kinetics and regrowth of survivors where cell regrowth and reproduction can be aided by nutrients from cells lysed during uv disinfection bohrerova et al 2015 chen et al 2020 kollu and örmeci 2015 in practice while standalone uv disinfection does not provide residual disinfection novel uv applications that disrupt dna repair nyangaresi et al 2019 2018 song et al 2019 or combined with a residual disinfectant can minimize pathogen regrowth mofidi and linden 2004 sensitivity analysis results indicated that increasing the uv fluence led to decreased correlation between uv fluence scenario 1 6 7 and risk outcomes fig s8 which may be explained by the greater levels of inactivation by the higher uv fluence and the tailing effect 4 5 light and material characteristics the propagation of uv and visible light through mediums is complex and requires accurate representations of optical characteristics and geometry that were mathematically simplified to develop this qmra model geometry impacts on irradiance distribution throughout the water matrix were considered negligible with the assumption of high uv transmittance castro alférez et al 2018 however geometry e g water depth and volume of the container would decrease the calculated photorepair fluence compared to photorepair fluence in laboratory studies where small petri dishes are used for irradiating samples schmidtlein et al 2015 for larger volumes this study observed less solar disinfection and slower repair compared with smaller volumes 7000 ml containers vs 50 ml petri dishes our study used photoreactivation data from bohrerova and linden 2007 so our model results compared to more realistic decentralized water users and container sizes would reflect higher solar disinfection and less repair than would be expected in a decentralized water supply again contributing to the conservativeness of our risk results therefore risk estimates calculated in this qmra are conservative because we translated photorepair results from petri dishes to larger and enclosed containers for example photorepair saturated around 15 min for samples under direct sunlight exposure in petri dishes bohrerova and linden 2007 but saturated at 60 min in this qmra fig 4 this difference can be attributed to the container attenuating sunlight intensity water quality and material impacts on light scattering can also reduce the calculated photorepair fluence but were not considered different container materials such as plastic bottles glass bottles earthenware plastic bags also affect light transmittance borde et al 2016 castro alférez et al 2018 figueredo fernández et al 2017 keogh et al 2015 sciacca et al 2011 wegelin et al 2001 although more opaque containers with minimal wpf transmit less uv a wavelengths that induce photorepair differences among plastics were found to have weak to moderate correlation to risk figs 4d s8 scenario 1 and 8 15 this qmra only considered sunlight at a single latitude but the model can be expanded to account for spatial and temporal differences in solar intensity jeon et al 2022 sunlight discontinuities e g changes in cloud cover and thermal impacts of sodis castro alférez et al 2017 4 6 modeling photorepair and regrowth the segmented photorepair fluence model used in our study reflects how uv a light causes both photorepair and solar inactivation oguma et al 2004 but the model is not able to separate the effects of these concurrent processes the hypothesis that accumulated fluence must reach a threshold before measurable inactivation effect is observed dejung et al 2007 can explain the sudden breakpoint in the segmented photorepair fluence response model thus the threshold fluence represents the fluence after which dna repair mechanisms are overwhelmed by the damage caused by solar inactivation mcguigan et al 2012 the lag to achieve this threshold fluence may cause the shouldering effect in solar inactivation geeraerd et al 2000 and could explain why photorepair is more prominent before the threshold photorepair fluence while inactivation is more prominent after the threshold the correlation of intensity of sunlight to the risk results increased as intensity decreased from high scenario 1 to medium scenario 4 to low intensity scenario 5 fig s8 this result indicates that photorepair risks have greater association with low sunlight intensity and low photorepair fluence which both favor photorepair over sodis sensitivity analysis results suggest that the estimated log reactivation and the photorepair fluence were the second and third most impactful variables respectively in the risk assessment model fig s8 indicating the importance of reproducibility and accuracy in calculating the photorepair fluence for this qmra model because data for fluence based determination of photorepair was obtained from a single study uncertainty related to molecular repair in photorepair fluence response kinetics fig s5 was captured using a distribution of values from model confidence intervals instead of singular points from the model table 1 simplifications at the microorganism and molecular level were also used to develop this qmra model at the microorganism level the photorepair response of one strain of e coli would not provide a complete picture of photorepair for all potential pathogens of concern in drinking water such as mycobacteria bohrerova and linden 2006 and fungal spores wen et al 2018 at the molecular level the characteristics and behavior of the photolyase enzyme in e coli were simplified due to data limitations due to close agreement between absorption and action spectrum of photolyase payne and sancar 1990 we assumed absorption of photorepair light resulted in a one to one translation between photorepair and photoreactivation leading to conservative risk estimates additionally while temperature and water quality were previously observed to impact the regrowth of e coli quek and hu 2008b shafaei et al 2017 these factors were not included in the current model but can be included in future qmra using the framework provided in this study additional future risk assessments may consider incorporating modeling bacterial photorepair and regrowth in holding ponds receiving uv treated wastewater effluent especially considering the increasing use of uv disinfection in indirect potable reuse such risk assessments should include estimations of holding pond concentrations pathogen loading mixing in the water matrix and water depth i e geometry impacts on solar intensity 5 conclusion according to this qmra model developed to calculate photorepair fluence and assess risk for photorepair during transport of drinking water from decentralized uv treatment systems the main factors impacting risk were initial source water contamination pathogen dose and uv fluence the calculation of photorepair fluence was also a critical aspect of the qmra model results and was primarily impacted by sunlight intensity the weighted photorepair factor value water collection time and exposure time slight differences in container material transmittance characteristics had little impact on risk of infection but opaque materials to transport and store water treated by uv will minimize photorepair competing kinetics of photorepair and solar disinfection introduce complexity into determining an appropriate window of time that uv treated water is safe to drink photorepair exposure should not exceed 45 60 min to achieve risk 1 in 10 000 when uv fluence 16 mj cm2 and contamination is 100 microorganisms l and these results emphasize source water protection and designing systems to ensure minimum uv fluence of 16 mj cm2 this qmra can be used to inform the placement of uv treated drinking water access points to reduce risk of photorepair and ensure safe drinking water our model can be used by wash practitioners to assess risk in decentralized drinking water distribution systems author contributions dm conceptualization data collection model development manuscript original draft

treatment plants dwtps make great contributions to the removal of micropollutants in raw water hasan et al 2020 however the complex degradation pathways of micropollutants can inevitably produce more hazardous products which brings new threats to drinking water dw safety nguyen et al 2021 rout et al 2021 recently microbial o methylation mom of halophenols hps in dw has received more and more

och3 with assistance of o methyltransferase omt and methyl donor e g s adenosine methionine sam traditional view holds that although the o methylated pollutants omps can cause taste and odor t o issues it may alleviate the toxicities of these compounds allard et al 1985 nevertheless recent toxicological researches in relation to omps provide us a new understanding of the toxic effects of omps the o methylated products of pentachlorophenol pcp has been regarded as persistent organic pollutant which has hepatotoxicity neurotoxicity and reproductive toxicity unep 2013 studies have shown that methyl triclosan mtcs was more harmful to vibrio fischeri than triclosan tcs in terms of acute toxicity farré et al 2008 and could cause abnormal expressions of the genes related to protein synthesis and modification in hepg2 li et al 2020 the o methylated products of diclofenac dcf showed significantly higher toxicity levels 430 times than dcf towards hyalella azteca fu et al 2020 moreover the strong lipophilicity of methoxy group makes omps have higher bioaccumulation factors than their precursors letting them become much easier to be accumulated in organisms unep 2013 therefore omps can be regarded as an emerging category of secondary contaminants which may be more harmful than their parent compounds as the potential precursors of omps the pollutants containing hydroxyl groups have been widely detected in raw water and dwtps which mainly include phenolic compounds e g chlorophenols bromophenols tcs etc vulliet et al 2011 zhang et al 2022 and carboxylic compounds e g dcf su et al 2020 these compounds may result in the formation of omps in dwtps díaz et al 2005 detected pentachloroanisole pca in one spanish dwtp and its concentration in raw water and sand filter water was 0 28 ng l and 0 72 ng l respectively wang et al 2021 reported the concentration of 2 4 6 trichloanisole 2 4 6 tca in the influent was 0 32 ng l and increased to 1 2 ng l in the effluent in a chinese dwtp the abovementioned cases showed that certain omps can be generated in dw treatment processes and can not be removed via the common oxidation processes including chlorine or potassium permanganate qi et al 2012 which makes dwtp become another non negligible omp formation place in addition to drinking water distribution systems dwdss researchers once estimated that nearly 10 of the aerobic heterotrophic microbes had the ability to methylate hps george and häggblom 2008 among which many genera of bacteria e g rhodococcus streptomyces etc mara and bisson 2005 allard et al 1987 as well as fungi e g aspergillus penicillium etc prak et al 2007 have been identified given that there is a wide variety of o methylating microorganisms in the environment the exploration of these microorganisms in dwtp becomes complicated and challenging while it is still significant when more knowledge of omp formation wants to be acquired bai et al 2017 firstly investigated the 2 4 6 tca producing fungi in water supply reservoirs and associated dwtps however since the number of fungi in dw is normally three logs less than that of bacteria van der wielen et al 2016 omp producing bacteria omppb are more likely to dominate the o methylation process in dwtp which deserve more attention in our previous studies zhang et al 2018a zhou et al 2021b 2019 the omppb in biofilms of dwdss were explored and most of them belong to chlorine resistance bacteria e g sphingomonas pseudomonas etc due to the lack of chlorine stress the bacterial communities in water before disinfection unit are more complicated and diverse than those in the finished water as a result more omppb kinds are expected to be found in dwtps instead of dwdss however no study has yet reported the distribution of omppb community and the major omppb species in dwtps additionally up to now there is no detection method for quantifying omppb which hinders the development of omppb study in dw in this study omppb in 15 water samples from three dwtps were investigated by both cultivation dependent and cultivation independent technologies the concentrations of six typical omps i e 2 4 6 tca 2 3 6 trichloroanisole 2 3 6 tca 2 4 6 tribromoanisole 2 4 6 tba pca mtcs and diclofenac methyl ester dcfme were measured and their odorous and toxic risks were assessed the omp formation potential ompfp of each sample was determined based on an optimized most probable number mpn method the estimated number of omppb of each sample was determined and subsequently correlated with ompfps cultivable omppb strains from all samples were isolated identified and their omp producing abilities were characterized finally through 16s rrna gene high throughput sequencing hts the omppb community structures in all samples were investigated and the potential o methyltransferases pomts responsible for omp formation were analyzed via picurst2 2 methods and materials 2 1 chemicals and reagents 2 4 6 trichlorophenol 2 4 6 tcp 5 mg ml in

by a milli q apparatus millipore corporation billerica massachusetts usa was used to dilute stock solutions 2 2 collection of water samples the collection of 15 water samples 2 l for each was carried out in three different dwtps xianlin xl jiuxi jx and nanxing nx in one city in zhejiang province of china from september to october in 2021 using sterile amber glass bottles without headspace the details of three dwtps are displayed in supporting information si table s1 once collected requisite amount of sodium thiosulfate was added into each sample to remove residual chlorine or ozone after being transported to the lab in an ice cooler all samples were stored at 4 c and subjected to the following treatments within 48 h 2 3 analysis of omps and basic water parameters the concentrations of 2 4 6 tca 2 3 6 tca 2 4 6 tba pca mtcs and dcfme in water samples were determined by solid phase micro extraction coupled with a gas chromatography equipped with an electron capture detector the detailed operation process of the method is shown in si text s1 basic water parameters including nh3 n codmn and uv254 were determined by a gl 8000uv multi parameter analyzer purchased from shandong green kairui precision instrument co ltd shandong china and the results are shown in si table s2 the total number of bacteria was measured by heterotrophic plate counting hpc 2 4 risk assessment of

determiantion of ompfps in order to evaluate the maximum omp production of omppb in water samples ompfps were determined by the addition of excess precursors of omps 5 nmol of 2 4 6 tcp 2 3 6 tcp 2 4 6 tbp pcp na and 50 nmol of tcs and dcf na were dosed into 100 ml of water sample and placed in an incubator at 30 c after 48 h the final concentrations of omps were determined and the produced omps final concentration minus initial concentration were regarded as ompfp all tests were conducted in duplicate 2 6 quantification of omppb an mpn method was established for quantifying the numbers of omppb which mainly contains three steps 1 cell proliferation 2 o methylation and 3 omp detection for checking positive sample sphingomonas ursincola z001 a typical omppb strain capable of producing has zhou et al 2021b was used to optimize the parameters in step 1 and 2 for shortening the operation time and obtaining higher omp production details in optimization process and the procedure of mpn method are provided in si text 2 the mpn calculation was performed according to the process reported in fu et al 2021 s study the feasibility of the established mpn method was verified by comparing the mpn and plate counting number pcn of s ursincola z001 cell suspensions with different cell densities 103 104 105 and 106 cfu ml the established mpn method was used to quantify omppb numbers in the collected water samples 2 7 investigation of cultivable omppb 2 7 1 isolation and identification of omppb after direct plating 15 water samples with appropriate dilution ratios onto the r2a agar the colonies with distinguishing colors shapes and textures were chosen by sterile inoculating loop and inoculated in the subsequent clean r2a agar plates for purification to obtain the omp producing capabilities omppcs ng cfu of each isolated strain an o methylation assay was performed and the details are displayed in si text s3 the strains with omppcs were regarded as omppb and they were subjected to 16s full length sequencing for species identification by personal biotechnology co ltd shanghai china the phylogenetic tree of all omppb strains was constructed using mega version 5 2 with the neighbor joining algorithm and visualized by itol https itol embl de 2 7 2 evaluaion of omppb s environment risks the risks of omppb were evaluated by their omp products in terms of odor

cfu l means the cell concentration of each omppb suspension which equals to 109 cfu l bfi is the bioaccumulation factor of certain omp 2 8 dna extraction hts and bioinformatics analysis the bacteria in water samples 1 l were collected by sterile 0 22 μm cellulose acetate membranes the procedures of dna extraction and hts were performed by personal biotechnology co ltd shanghai china and the details were reported in our previous study zhang et al 2018a amplicon sequence variant asv belongs to omppb were selected to conduct the bioinformatics analysis relative abundance of selected taxa within each community was calculated by comparing the number of sequences of a specific taxon versus the number of total sequences shannon index pielou s evenness index were used to describe the alpha diversity of each omppb community and principal coordinate analysis pcoa was used to show the beta diversity of all omppb communities the pomts were predicted by picurst2 2 9 statistic methods pearson analysis was used to explore the correlations between water parameters and ompfps linear regression model log scale was used to establish the relationship between mpn and pcn of s ursincola z001 s cell suspension and the relationship between ompfp and mpn of real water samples hierarchical clustering performed by originpro 2022 was used for grouping omppb in terms of omppcs spearman analysis was applied to find the relationship between 16s full length sequence dissimilarity and omppc dissimilarity mantel test was performed to explore the influence of omppb community towards ompfp by r project 3 6 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 concentrations and risk assessment of omps among six omps only four has were detected in three dwtps no mtcs and dcfme could be found in any samples as shown in fig 1 a all has were detected in xl while only three and two has were discovered in jx and nx respectively moreover the concentrations of has in xl were much larger than those in jx and nx indicating higher ha pollution level in xl among the three dwtps as for major ha species 2 4 6 tca dominated in xl and nx while 2 4 6 tba and pca dominated in the front units rw and st and the subsequent units sft acft and cwt of jx respectively si table s4 shows that the removal rates of has in all dwtps were limited which means current dw treatment processes can not efficiently control has even with the assistance of ozone oxidation coupled with ac adsorption nx additionally the concentrations of certain has even increased during dw treatment e g 2 3 6 tca concentration increased from 0 28 to 0 49 ng l in xl pca concentration increased from 0 04 to 0 08 ng l in jx which further confirms omps could be formed in dwtps odor risk assessment showed that compared with 2 3 6 tca and pca 2 4 6 tca and 2 4 6 tba might cause severe earthy and musty problems in the dw produced by xl and jx fig 1 b according to toxicity risk assessment fig 1 c the q toxicity of has were all below 10 5 which signifies these has exhibited low toxicities in three dwtps 3 2 determination of ompfps fig 2 shows that four has and dcfme could be formed in the collected samples among which xl and jx samples preferred to form 2 4 6 tca 1 3 38 3 ng l in xl 0 3 3 9 ng l in jx while nx samples preferred to form dcfme 3 6 6 0 ng l in general the ompfps showed an decreasing trend from raw water to treated water except fp of dcfme in nx however they could increase after certain units such as sft xl nx and acft jx additionally the ompfp profile in each dwtp was also changed during water treatment si fig s1 the correlation analysis between ompfp and water quality parameters showed that nh3 n and uv254 were positively correlated with the fps of 2 4 6 tca 2 3 6 tca and 2 4 6 tba p 0 05 while codmn had no correlation with any omps si fig s2 ompfp can reflect the o methylation abilities of omppb in dw our studies found that the o methylation abilities varied within three dwtps and changed significantly during each treatment process the recovery of ompfps in the effluents of sft and acft indicates that omppb may harbor in the filters and detach from the media when biofilm becomes senescent perujo et al 2019 it should be mentioned that some water samples especially those from nx could produce dcfme a product with much higher toxicity than dcf the researchers proved that the biological o methylation of dcf could exist in two keystone invertebrate species gammarus pulex and hyalella azteca fu et al 2020 nevertheless although studies proved microorganisms can methylate carboxylic compounds kang et al 2021 petronikolou and nair 2015 no study has yet reported dcf can be methylated by bacteria our studies firstly proved that omppb in dwtps can methylate dcf to dcfme indicating mom in dw can not only cause t o problem but also toxicity problem moreover the results also suggest that nh4 and certain organic carbon may promote the o methylation reaction of omppb this is probably because these matters are raw materials for making omts methyl donor sam and other compounds related to sam circle which directly links to the efficiency of o methylation fustin 2022 however the use of ompfp can not clearly tell us the specific quantities and types of omppb in dw so that other methods will be applied to explore this information in the next sections 3 3 quantification of omppb through mpn method 3 3 1 establishment of mpn method fig 3 a shows that although the growth rate of z001 increased with the increase of initial cell density the od600 of cell suspensions all reached the similar level 1 0 1 1 in day 5 the result indicated r2a liquid medium was quite suitable for the cell proliferation of bacteria in dw even though the initial cell density was extremely low 1 cfu ml in the consideration of both enough biomass and time saving 3 d was chosen as the cultivation time fig 3 b shows that the 2 4 6 tca production reached the maximum levels in day 2 and then dropped steadily due to the possible 2 4 6 tca degradation therefore 2 d was chosen as the o methylation reaction time fig 3 c demonstrates that when 2 4 6 tcp dosage was 0 1 μg only the cell culture with high initial cell density 106 cfu ml could produce enough 2 4 6 tca 267 ng l however when 2 4 6 tcp dosage increased to 1 0 μg all cell cultures could produce enough 2 4 6 tca 207 321 ng l in order to lower the detection limit of mpn method especially for the samples with low omppb numbers high precursor dosage 1 0 μg should be recommended after optimizing the key parameters the accuracy of this method was validated as shown in fig 3 d the result illustrates a linear relationship between the mpn and the pcn with the slope equal to 0 8878 r2 0 9765 the strong correlation indicated the feasibility of using mpn method to estimate the quantities of omppb in dw unfortunately the omppb capable of methylating carboxylic compounds were excluded when determining omppb mpn in this study because z001 can not use carboxylic compounds and no other suitable bacterial strains were available so far 3 3 2 calculation of omppb numbers the established mpn method was performed to enumerate cultivable omppb numbers in all water samples the positive reaction counts over number of total replicates at each dilution level are listed in table 1 and mpns with a 95 confidence limit of cultivable omppb were calculated based on the positive reaction counts at dilution levels in general samples from jx contained relatively higher cultivable omppb numbers 4 3 103 2 9 105 mpn ml than xl 1 6 102 4 3 104 mpn ml and nx 8 0 4 3 104 mpn ml the processes in all dwtps performed decent removal efficiencies towards omppb by reducing 2 to 3 logs of mpns which was mainly due to the contribution of disinfection unit however si fig s3 showed the ratio of omppb mpn and hpc number mpn hpc increased greatly from the rw samples 11 2 21 4 to the cwt samples 40 0 56 8 demonstrating the cultivable omppb gradually dominated the cultivable bacterial community during dw treatment thus our results found that although the quantities of omppb dropped in dwtps the proportion of omppb in bacterial community increased on the contrary 3 3 3 analysis of relationship between ompfp and omppb mpn in order to assess the relationship between omppb mpn and total hafps a regression analysis with 95 prediction interval was performed fig 4 a c show that in each dwtp total hafps could correlate well with omppb mpn in a linear model under log scale r2 0 655 0 898 therefore three prediction functions xl y 0 496 0 373 jx y 0 041 0 465 nx y 0 218 0 237 were obtained accordingly as shown in fig 4 d under the same mpn level the omppb in xl could produce more has followed by jx and nx mpn methods are widely used to quantify microbes with certain metabolic function in the environments such as fecal coliform fu et al 2021 denitrifying and nitrate reducing bacteria boellmann and martienssen 2020 opportunistic pathogen niu et al 2022 etc george and häggblom 2008 employed an mpn assay to measure the number of o methylating microbes in marsh sediments however that method might take 45 days to obtain the result in our study a mpn method within five days was successfully established and applied to quantify the cultivable omppb in water samples from dwtps omppb mpns differed largely in dwtps from different source water and varied through the treatment processes the relatively high mpn hpc suggested the proportion of omppb in the dw bacterial community might be far beyond our imagination which further emphasizes the complexity and importance of the omppb investigation however the present mpn method was based on cell cultivation in liquid medium the non cultivable omppb can not be measured additionally mpn relies on the principle of statistics so that the result of mpn is just an estimated bacteria number with the most possibility cochran 1950 which is different from the actual value in the authors perspective the precise quantification of total omppb is likely to be realized through q pcr method if the functional genes of omppb are available in the future the purpose of quantifying omppb is to assess the omp risk in dw in our previous study zhou et al 2019 a linear correlation between hafp and total bacteria hpc was established in a simulated dwds reactor which was not precise enough due to the use of hpc instead of the omppb number for improvement this work established the relationship between omppb mpn and ompfp in each dwtp the different regression functions in three dwtps illustrated that the omp pollution risk can not only be determined by the quantity of omppb but also the average o methylating ability of each omppb cell 3 4 investigation of cultivable omppb 3 4 1 identification and phylogenetic analysis of cultivable omppb 105 bacterial strains with distinguishing colony shapes were isolated from the water samples of three dwtps among which 28 isolates 10 in xl five in jx and 13 in nx were proved to have o methylating abilities these omppb were identified through 16s full length sequencing and the results are shown in si table s5 based on the blast results all strains showed 97 100 sequence similarity to their closet database entries which belonged to 19 different species it is worth noting that the genera of bacillus erythrobacter pelomonas brevundimonas paenibacillus ralstonia chromobacterium bradyrhizobium xanthobacter and caulobacter were newly found omppb genera to our knowledge which further expands the family of o methylating microbes moreover phylogenetic relationships of 28 strains were determined with the 16s rrna gene tree calculated and constructed by nj algorithm fig 5 a nine 11 and one species were affiliated with the class of alphaproteobacteria betaproteobacteria and gammaproteobactera respectively within phylum proteobacteria the most dominant bacterial phylum in dw while seven species belonged to class bacilli within phylum bacillota 3 4 2 determination of omppcs as shown in fig 5 b the omppcs varied significantly among all omppb strains ranging from 8 5 10 12 ng cfu to 2 3 10 9 ng cfu bradyrhizobium frederickii nxsft 16 exhibited the most remarkable omppc which preferred to produce 2 4 6 tca 1 7 10 9 ng cfu followed by pca 3 86 10 10 ng cfu and 2 4 6 tba 1 92 10 10 ng cfu bacillus australimaris xlst 11 showed comparable omppc 1 31 10 9 ng cfu while it could only produce pca similarly other bacillus strains including bacillus aerius jxrw 4 nxoct 9 bacillus velezensis nxst 7 and bacillus australimaris nxsft 15 also preferred or only produced pca showing the preference of bacillus s omts for methylating pcp rather than other precursors however the preference of omts might be different among strains belonging to the same species four ralstonia mannitolilytica stranis nxsft 4 nxsft 5 nxsft 7 and nxsft 8 could only produce pca while ralstonia mannitolilytica jxsft 1 could produce 2 4 6 tca and 2 4 6 tba in order to obtain clearer classification of the omppb strains in terms of o methylation a hierarchical clustering tree fig 5 c was developed based on the euclidean distance of omppcs the strains were clustered into 16 subbranches among which only two subbranches colored in red and bright green contained more than two strains in each subbranch indicating the high diversities of omppcs of these omppb the strains from the effluents of sft and acft were both classified into six subbranches demonstrating the omppb in filtration units may have multiple o methylating abilities in this study a bradyrhizobium frederickii isolated from the effluent of sft showed the best omppc among all the omppb bradyrhizobium is the dominant genus in the filters gerrity et al 2018 yonkyu et al 2019 which is likely because of its strong ability to secrete extracellular polymeric substances eps that can help cell attach to the filter media skorupska et al 2006 it was reported that bradyrhizobium played an important role in aromatics degradation oh et al 2018 and our study proves that o methylation is likely involved in the degradation pathways as a nitrogen fixing bacterium bradyrhizobium needs to absorb iron for the synthesis of enzymes involved in nitrogen fixation lesueur et al 1993 our previous study revealed that appropriate amount of fe3 could promote the activity of mom zhou et al 2021a so that it can be inferred that the presence of fe3 in bradyrhizobium cell may enhance the production of omps five ralstonia mannitolilytica strains with relatively weak omppcs were isolated only from the effluent of sft unit ferreira et al 2012 confirmed that slow sand filtration could efficiently eradicate ralstonia solanacearum a plant pathogen from recycled irrigation water in brazil this evidences suggested that ralstonia can assemble in sft and become potential omp contributors bacillus spps were the most common omppb isolates in our study and distributed widely in rw st sft oct and acft lee et al 2006 reported bacillus cereus could synthesize omt that uses flavonoids containing ortho hydroxyl groups as substrates and can transfer a methyl group to either of two hydroxyl groups our finding further indicated that phenols with single hydroxyl group can also be the substrates of bacillus s omt in cwt samples only one omppb species brevundimonas diminuta was screened brevundimonas belongs to typical disinfectant resistant bacteria which can favourably inhabit in chlorinated or chloraminated dwdss zhang et al 2019a additionally brevundimonas was key functional taxa in phenol stimulated sludges zhang et al 2018b indicating its high tolerance of phenolic compounds than bacteria thus brevundimonas may be the dominant omppb in dwdss in order to explore whether the sequence difference of 16s rrna gene can determine the difference of omppc correlation was established between pairwise 16s rrna gene sequence distance and omppc distance as shown in si fig s4 relatively close correlation was found in alphaproteobacteria si fig s4 a r 0 4569 p 0 005 and betaproteobacteria si fig s4 b r 0 4243 p 0 001 while only the correlation line of betaproteobacteria has a positive slope no significant or close correlation could be found in bacilli si fig s4 c r 0 2091 p 0 363 and all omppb si fig s4 d r 0 2089 p 0 001 the results demonstrate that the omppc distance can not be well described by the pairwise 16s rrna gene sequence distance in most cases recently there has been a desire to predict functional capacity of bacteria based on the marker gene e g 16s rrna gene sequence data deng and huang 2015 however this strategy had limitations in several aspects a well known study showed that three escherichia coli strains had the coincident 16s sequence while they shared only 39 2 of their combined set of proteins welch et al 2002 similarly henson et al 2015 reported that three hexavalent chromium cr vi reducing microbacterium spp showed varying chromate responses despite their identical 16s rrna gene sequences sevigny et al 2019 quantified the correlation between phylogenetic gene and functional capacity through a large scale analysis the authors observed that 16s rrna gene was not appropriate to predict the functional capacity and additional marker genes should be examined our results further confirmed the limited prediction ability of 16s rrna gene the authors look forward that with the increasing knowledge of omt gene sequence in the future it can be an alternative for better predicting the omppc difference between omppb strains 3 4 3 evaluaion of environment risks of omppb the omppb strains were further evaluated in terms of the risks of produced omps in three aspects the result showed that 28 strains could be roughly aggregated in two groups fig 6 the left group contains seven strains producing omps with relatively low ois 7 7 10 5 5 5 10 3 but the highest abf 2452 the right group includes 21 strains which produce omps with varying abfs and tis but relatively high ois 9 3 10 2 63 the results illustrated that odor issues rather than toxicity problems should be considered firstly for the most omppb however the strain b australimaris xlst 11 which could produce the most toxic omp pca can not be ignored in this study since the high abf of pca might amplify the health risks to the consumers the previous studies related to mom in dw mostly emphasized the risks of t o while ignored the risks of bioaccumulation and toxicity as the precursor of 2 4 6 tba 2 4 6 tbp is a typical toxic halogenated contaminant which has already been found in human maternal 22 pg g ww and cord blood 37 pg g ww as well as in blood samples 81 pg ml lw koch and sures 2018 although the information concerning the 2 4 6 tba concentration in human tissues is largely missing it can be inferred a high potential of 2 4 6 tba accumulation in human body due to the higher bf of 2 4 6 tba than 2 4 6 tbp pca is regarded as the most toxic chloroanisoles due to the high chlorine atom number on its molecular structure reports suggested that pca is genotoxic and associated with an increased incidences of benign pheochromocytomas adrenal tumours and hemangiosarcomas rapid invasive growing cancer of the liver in male mice unep 2013 moreover the reproductive toxicity of pca in rats was manifested as decreased corpora lutea and increased embryolethality unep 2013 therefore our study demonstrates the omppb in dw may cause multiple risks that threaten the health of consumers 3 5 characterization of omppb communities by hts 3 5 1 community structure of omppb according to the omppb genera reported in the references si table s6 and identified in this study 23 omppb genera were selected and their relative abundances in bacterial communities are shown in fig 7 a acinetobacter 0 03 22 13 pseudomonas 0 39 27 78 novosphingobium 0 04 5 08 and paenibacillus 0 06 20 32 could be found in all samples while brachybacterium 0 01 streptomyces 0 01 0 02 erythrobacter 0 01 and xanthobacter 0 01 0 04 only existed in a few samples the asv numbers of omppb exhibited the highest values in xl 173 580 followed by nx 95 166 and jx 37 94 and showed a reduction trend in xl and jx but increased slightly in nx fig 7 b similarly xl samples displayed the highest shannon and pielou s evenness indices followed by nx and jx fig 7 c d indicating the diversity and evenness of omppb communities in xl were better than other two dwtps fig 7 e shows the community structures of omppb were distinct in three dwtps and switched regularly in the direction of treatment process in each dwtp this means dw treatment process may serve as a key drive factor to shape the community structure of omppb many studies have reported that the treatment units in dwtp can shift the bacterial composition in water samples our analysis revealed a consistent fact that from rw to st the proportion of novosphingobium increased from 0 03 0 22 to 0 22 1 09 while the proportion of flavobacterium decreased from 0 01 0 04 to 1 03 1 88 fig 7 a this seems to be in agreement with the study of lin et al 2014 who discovered the relative abundance of novosphingobium raised nearly four times and that of flavobacterium dropped nearly 75 from the feed water to setting pond water sft and acft are medium dependent treatment units in which bacteria can inhabit on the medium surface or inside the medium pore and play an important role in the degradation of organic matters in our results the proportions of pseudomonas and paenibacillus raised in the effluents of sft and acft in all three dwtps signifying these two genera may dominate in sft and acft the capabilities of producing exopolysaccharide or eps by paenibacillus chen et al 2022 and pseudomonas singh et al 2022 wang et al 2022 may help them be enriched in the microbiome in the filters the chlorination step showed a substantial influence on the omppb community structure fig 7 e although the asv numbers of cwt was significantly reduced in xl they unexpectedly showed an rising trend in jx and nx mainly due to the increasing asvs belonging to bacillus paenibacillus pseudomonas and sphingomonas these genera are typical chlorine resistant bacteria and can rapidly recover in cwt after chlorination luo et al 2021 3 5 2 correlation analysis of omppb community and hafp profile in order to confirm whether the hafp profile was determined by omppb community in dw normalized hafp profile matrix si table s7 and normalized omppb community composition matrix si table s8 were correlated by mantel test fig 8 the larger the correlation coefficient and the smaller the p value of the mantel test are the greater the influence of certain omppb genus on the hafp profile as shown in fig 8 total hafp was significantly correlated with mycobacterium mantel s p 0 05 and pelomonas mantel s p 0 05 pca fp was also significantly correlated with pelomonas mantel s p 0 05 while 2 4 6 tca fp had no significant correlation with any omppb genus given that the proportions of mycobacterium and pelomonas were not dominant in omppb community fig 7 a si table s8 it can be inferred that rare omppb taxa might also play key roles in shaping the composition of hafp unfortunately due to the large quantities of the default values in 2 3 6 tca and 2 4 6 tba columns si table s7 mantel test could not be performed between omppb community and 2 3 6 tca fp or 2 4 6 tba fp alone additionally the correlation analysis between omppb genera revealed that pelomonas was negatively correlated with paenibacillus p 0 05 sphingobium p 0 05 and rhodococcus p 0 01 while mycobacterium was not significantly correlated with any other genus in general the hafp profile was strongly influenced by certain important genera in omppb community 3 5 3 evaluation of pomts using picurst2 for functional prediction four phenolic omts and four carboxylic omts were discovered to be the pomts fig 9 among the phenolic omts 3 demethylubiquinol 3 o methyltransferase coq3 had the highest relative abundance followed by caffeoyl coa o methyltransferase ccomt catechol o methyltransferase comt and acetylserotonin o methyltransferase asmt among the carboxylic omts protein glutamate o methyltransferase pgmt protein l isoaspartate d aspartate o methyltransferase pimt and malonyl acyl carrier protein o methyltransferase mamt had the comparable relative abundances while the relative abundances of protein s isoprenylcysteine o methyltransferase pilmt were extremely low and only existed in a few samples it should be noted that the relative abundances of ccomt and asmt were enriched in the effluents of acft and cwt respectively which suggests certain operation units can change the functions of pomts via shaping the omppb community in our previous study zhang et al 2018a only two pomt types comt and ccomt were discovered in the biofilms of three pilot scale dwdss by function prediction based on 16s sequence data the current study revealed six additional pomts compared to the former one indicating that the omt categories and potential o methylation process existed in dwtps are more diverse and complicated than those in dwdss according to the substrate specificity of four phenolic omts comt ccomt and coq3 prefer to use catechol guaiacol and their analogues while only asmt can methylate substrate containing monophenol structure si table s9 therefore asmt is more likely to methylate hps to produce has compared with the rest three phenolic omts the substrates of four carboxylic omts are all amino acid residues of proteins with high molecular weights while so far no evidence has proved that they can catalyze the o methylaion of small molecular carboxylic compounds like dcf unfortunately picurst2 prediction could only provide some superficial knowledge about pomts of omppb in future studies it is believed that some advanced approaches like metagenomics macro transcriptomics and macro proteomics are promising tools to reveal more comprehensive mechanism of mom 3 6 environmental implications in this study cultivation dependent and cultivation independent methods were successfully used to explore the omppb in dwtps cultivation methods revealed the quantity of omppb table 1 as well as the omppc and its characterization of each isolated omppb strain figs 5 b and 6 in water samples which may help us understand whether the omp risk exists in dw and how serious it is as complement to microbial cultivation hts provides us a complete picture of omppb community and the potential dominant omppb genera in each sample cause it involves large quantities of nonculturable bacteria in the community therefore the combination of the two technologies can comprehensively analyze omppb in dw and ought to be introduced to other environmental medium for potential omp risk assessment the results proved that pca and dcfme with high toxicities were generated from two common micropollutants pcp and dcf by omppb in dw fig 2 and many cultivable omppb could only produce toxic pca instead of odorous 2 4 6 tca and 2 4 6 tba these evidences remind us that the role of mom of oh containing compounds should be reassessed in all directions causing t o issues may not the only problem we need to consider when mom happens posing toxic risk to the environment should be also paid much attention moreover apart from phenolic compounds one carboxylic compound dcf was also included in the precursors of mom suggesting the precursor list may be largely expanded in the near future as a result the study of mom of micropollutants mainly has two orientations 1 seeking more potential precursors and 2 evaluating its environmental risks via multiple dimensions the elevated omp concentrations fig 1 ompfps fig 2 and many omppb strains fig 5 in the effluents of sft and acft suggest that the filters may harbor considerable omppb containing intracellular omps they retain in the filter media and are likely to recirculate amongst the filter backwash water fbw due to its high chemical and biological contamination fbw may increase the load of the original treatment units during fbw reuse if it is not purified properly so far several oxidation processes especially o3 uv h2o2 and uv have been proven effectively for removing organic matters and microorganisms in fbw chuang et al 2019 ogura and sabogal paz 2022 zhang et al 2019b however the oxidation of omppb can result in cell broken and the intracellular omps may be released into the water which cause more serious problems therefore alternatives without damaging viable omppb cell should be chosen to treat omppb contaminated fbw recently membrane filtration technologies have been utilized to removal residual microbes in water treatment goswami and pugazhenthi 2020 for instance a hybrid coagulation ultrafiltration uf process was successfully applied to remove heavy metals and coliform in spent fbw mahdavi et al 2018 with the pretreatment of caogulation the average removal rate of total coliform and fecal coliform was 88 and 79 respectively and after uf unit it reached 100 and 100 respectively thus uf associated technologies may be a feasible method in omppb removal from fbw although more evidences are needed to prove its credibility 4 conclusion in this study four omps 2 4 6 tca 2 3 6 tca 2 4 6 tba and pca were detected in dw samples from three dwtps according to ompfp assay ompfps varied significantly among different dwtps and treatment units and the transformation of dcf towards dcfme was firstly proved in dw through an optimized mpn method dw samples from jx were found to contain the highest omppb numbers followed by xl and nx the correlations between total hafps and omppb quantities were well described by a linear model under the log scale 28 out of 105 bacterial isolates from dw samples were proved to have the ability of o methylating hps among them b frederickii preferred to generate 2 4 6 tca and led to off flavor problem while four bacillus spp strains and four r mannitolilytica stranis could only produce pca with toxicity risks hts revealed that treatment processes shaped the omppb communities in dwtps in terms of compositions alpha and beta diversities mantel test showed that hafp profile was strongly influenced by mycobacterium and pelomonas in addition coq3 ccomt comt asmt pgmt pimt mamt pilmt were predicted as pomts via picurst2 analysis to assess and control the omp contamination in dw different aspects odor toxicity and bioaccumulation should be considered in the risk assessment of omppb and the accumulation of omppb in filter units deserve more concerns

treatment plants dwtps make great contributions to the removal of micropollutants in raw water hasan et al 2020 however the complex degradation pathways of micropollutants can inevitably produce more hazardous products which brings new threats to drinking water dw safety nguyen et al 2021 rout et al 2021 recently microbial o methylation mom of halophenols hps in dw has received more and more attention since it causes the formation of haloanisoles has with earthy and musty odor zhou et al 2021a b in the process of mom the hydroxyl group oh of precursor can be transformed to methoxy group och3 with assistance of o methyltransferase omt and methyl donor e g s adenosine methionine sam traditional view holds that although the o methylated pollutants omps can cause taste and odor t o issues it may alleviate the toxicities of these compounds allard et al 1985 nevertheless recent toxicological researches in relation to omps provide us a new understanding of the toxic effects of omps the o methylated products of pentachlorophenol pcp has been regarded as persistent organic pollutant which has hepatotoxicity neurotoxicity and reproductive toxicity unep 2013 studies have shown that methyl triclosan mtcs was more harmful to vibrio fischeri than triclosan tcs in terms of acute toxicity farré et al 2008 and could cause abnormal expressions of the genes related to protein synthesis and modification in hepg2 li et al 2020 the o methylated products of diclofenac dcf showed significantly higher toxicity levels 430 times than dcf towards hyalella azteca fu et al 2020 moreover the strong lipophilicity of methoxy group makes omps have higher bioaccumulation factors than their precursors letting them become much easier to be accumulated in organisms unep 2013 therefore omps can be regarded as an emerging category of secondary contaminants which may be more harmful than their parent compounds as the potential precursors of omps the pollutants containing hydroxyl groups have been widely detected in raw water and dwtps which mainly include phenolic compounds e g chlorophenols bromophenols tcs etc vulliet et al 2011 zhang et al 2022 and carboxylic compounds e g dcf su et al 2020 these compounds may result in the formation of omps in dwtps díaz et al 2005 detected pentachloroanisole pca in one spanish dwtp and its concentration in raw water and sand filter water was 0 28 ng l and 0 72 ng l respectively wang et al 2021 reported the concentration of 2 4 6 trichloanisole 2 4 6 tca in the influent was 0 32 ng l and increased to 1 2 ng l in the effluent in a chinese dwtp the abovementioned cases showed that certain omps can be generated in dw treatment processes and can not be removed via the common oxidation processes including chlorine or potassium permanganate qi et al 2012 which makes dwtp become another non negligible omp formation place in addition to drinking water distribution systems dwdss researchers once estimated that nearly 10 of the aerobic heterotrophic microbes had the ability to methylate hps george and häggblom 2008 among which many genera of bacteria e g rhodococcus streptomyces etc mara and bisson 2005 allard et al 1987 as well as fungi e g aspergillus penicillium etc prak et al 2007 have been identified given that there is a wide variety of o methylating microorganisms in the environment the exploration of these microorganisms in dwtp becomes complicated and challenging while it is still significant when more knowledge of omp formation wants to be acquired bai et al 2017 firstly investigated the 2 4 6 tca producing fungi in water supply reservoirs and associated dwtps however since the number of fungi in dw is normally three logs less than that of bacteria van der wielen et al 2016 omp producing bacteria omppb are more likely to dominate the o methylation process in dwtp which deserve more attention in our previous studies zhang et al 2018a zhou et al 2021b 2019 the omppb in biofilms of dwdss were explored and most of them belong to chlorine resistance bacteria e g sphingomonas pseudomonas etc due to the lack of chlorine stress the bacterial communities in water before disinfection unit are more complicated and diverse than those in the finished water as a result more omppb kinds are expected to be found in dwtps instead of dwdss however no study has yet reported the distribution of omppb community and the major omppb species in dwtps additionally up to now there is no detection method for quantifying omppb which hinders the development of omppb study in dw in this study omppb in 15 water samples from three dwtps were investigated by both cultivation dependent and cultivation independent technologies the concentrations of six typical omps i e 2 4 6 tca 2 3 6 trichloroanisole 2 3 6 tca 2 4 6 tribromoanisole 2 4 6 tba pca mtcs and diclofenac methyl ester dcfme were measured and their odorous and toxic risks were assessed the omp formation potential ompfp of each sample was determined based on an optimized most probable number mpn method the estimated number of omppb of each sample was determined and subsequently correlated with ompfps cultivable omppb strains from all samples were isolated identified and their omp producing abilities were characterized finally through 16s rrna gene high throughput sequencing hts the omppb community structures in all samples were investigated

by a milli q apparatus millipore corporation billerica massachusetts usa was used to dilute stock solutions 2 2 collection of water samples the collection of 15 water samples 2 l for each was carried out in three different dwtps xianlin xl jiuxi jx and nanxing nx in one city in zhejiang province of china from september to october in 2021 using sterile amber glass bottles without headspace the details of three dwtps are displayed in supporting information si table s1 once collected requisite amount of sodium thiosulfate was added into each sample to remove residual chlorine or ozone after being transported to the lab in an ice cooler all samples were stored at 4 c and subjected to the following treatments within 48 h 2 3 analysis of omps and basic water parameters the concentrations of 2 4 6 tca 2 3 6 tca 2 4 6 tba pca mtcs and dcfme in water samples were determined by solid phase micro extraction coupled with a gas chromatography equipped with an electron capture detector the detailed operation process of the method is shown in si text s1 basic water parameters including nh3 n codmn and uv254 were determined by a gl 8000uv multi parameter analyzer purchased from shandong

determiantion of ompfps in order to evaluate the maximum omp production of omppb in water samples ompfps were determined by the addition of excess precursors of omps 5 nmol of 2 4 6 tcp 2 3 6 tcp 2 4

final concentration minus initial concentration were regarded as ompfp all tests were conducted in duplicate 2 6 quantification of omppb an mpn method was established for quantifying the numbers of omppb which mainly contains three steps 1 cell proliferation 2 o methylation and 3 omp detection for checking positive sample sphingomonas ursincola z001 a typical omppb strain capable of producing

the mpn and plate counting number pcn of s ursincola z001 cell suspensions with different cell densities 103 104 105 and 106 cfu ml the established mpn method was used to quantify omppb numbers in the collected water samples 2 7 investigation of cultivable omppb 2 7 1 isolation and identification of omppb after direct plating 15 water samples with appropriate dilution ratios onto the r2a agar the colonies with distinguishing colors shapes and textures were chosen by sterile inoculating loop and inoculated in the subsequent clean r2a agar plates for purification to obtain the omp producing

cfu l means the cell concentration of each omppb suspension which equals to 109 cfu l bfi is the bioaccumulation factor of certain omp 2 8 dna extraction hts and bioinformatics analysis the bacteria in water samples 1 l were collected by sterile 0 22 μm cellulose acetate membranes the procedures of dna extraction and hts were performed by personal biotechnology co ltd shanghai china and the details were reported in our previous study zhang et al 2018a amplicon sequence variant asv belongs to omppb were selected to conduct the bioinformatics analysis relative abundance of selected taxa within each community was calculated by comparing the number of sequences of a specific taxon versus the number of total sequences shannon index pielou s evenness index were used to describe the alpha diversity of each omppb community and principal coordinate analysis pcoa was used to show the beta diversity of all omppb communities the pomts were predicted by picurst2 2 9 statistic methods pearson analysis was used to explore the correlations between water parameters and ompfps linear regression model log scale was used to establish the relationship between mpn and pcn of s ursincola z001 s cell suspension and the relationship between ompfp and mpn of real water samples hierarchical clustering performed by originpro 2022 was used for grouping omppb in terms of omppcs spearman analysis was applied to find the relationship between 16s full length sequence dissimilarity and omppc dissimilarity mantel test was performed to explore the influence of omppb community towards ompfp by r project 3 6 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 concentrations and risk assessment of omps among six omps only four has were detected in three dwtps no mtcs and dcfme could be found in any samples as shown in fig 1 a all has were detected in xl while only three and two has were discovered in jx and nx respectively moreover the concentrations of has in xl were much larger than those in jx and nx indicating higher ha pollution level in xl among the three dwtps as for major ha species 2 4 6 tca dominated in xl and nx while 2 4 6 tba and pca dominated in the front units rw and st and the subsequent units sft acft and cwt of jx respectively si table s4 shows that the removal rates of has in all dwtps were limited which means current dw treatment processes can not efficiently control has even with the assistance of ozone oxidation coupled with ac adsorption nx additionally the concentrations of certain has even increased during dw treatment e g 2 3 6 tca concentration increased from 0 28 to 0 49 ng l in xl pca concentration increased from 0 04 to 0 08 ng l in jx which further confirms omps could be formed in dwtps odor risk assessment showed that compared with 2 3 6 tca and pca 2 4 6 tca and 2 4 6 tba might cause severe earthy and musty problems in the dw produced by xl and jx fig 1 b according to toxicity risk assessment fig 1 c the q toxicity of has were all below 10 5 which signifies these has exhibited low toxicities in three dwtps 3 2 determination of ompfps fig 2 shows that four has and dcfme could be formed in the collected samples among which xl and jx samples preferred to form 2 4 6 tca 1 3 38 3 ng l in xl 0 3 3 9 ng l in jx while nx samples preferred to form dcfme 3 6 6 0 ng l in general the ompfps showed an decreasing trend from raw water to treated water except fp of dcfme in nx however they could increase after certain units such as sft xl nx and acft jx additionally the ompfp profile in each dwtp was also changed during water treatment si fig s1 the correlation analysis between ompfp and water quality parameters showed that nh3 n and uv254 were positively correlated with the fps of 2 4 6 tca 2 3 6 tca and 2 4 6 tba p 0 05 while codmn had no correlation with any omps si fig s2 ompfp can reflect the o methylation abilities of omppb in dw our studies found that the o methylation abilities varied within three dwtps and changed significantly during each treatment process the recovery of ompfps in the effluents of sft and acft indicates that omppb may harbor in the filters and detach from the media when biofilm becomes senescent perujo et al 2019 it should be mentioned that some water samples especially those from nx could produce dcfme a product with much higher toxicity than dcf the researchers proved that the biological o methylation of dcf could exist in two keystone invertebrate species gammarus pulex and hyalella azteca fu et al 2020 nevertheless although studies proved microorganisms can methylate carboxylic compounds kang et al 2021 petronikolou and nair 2015 no study has yet reported dcf can be methylated by bacteria our studies firstly proved that omppb in dwtps can methylate dcf to dcfme indicating mom in dw can not only cause t o problem but also toxicity problem moreover the results also suggest that nh4 and certain organic carbon may promote the o methylation reaction of omppb this is probably because these matters are raw materials for making omts methyl donor sam and other compounds related to sam circle which directly links to the efficiency of o methylation fustin 2022 however the use of ompfp can not clearly tell us the specific quantities and types of omppb in dw so that other methods will be applied to explore this information in the next sections 3 3 quantification of omppb through mpn method 3 3 1 establishment of mpn method fig 3 a shows that although the growth rate of z001 increased with the increase of initial cell density the od600 of cell suspensions all reached the similar level 1 0 1 1 in day 5 the result indicated r2a liquid medium was quite suitable for the cell proliferation of bacteria in dw even though the initial cell density was extremely low 1 cfu ml in the consideration of both enough biomass and time saving 3 d was chosen as the cultivation time fig 3 b shows that the 2 4 6 tca production reached the maximum levels in day 2 and then dropped steadily due to the possible 2 4 6 tca degradation therefore 2 d was chosen as the o methylation reaction time fig 3 c demonstrates that when 2 4 6 tcp dosage was 0 1 μg only the cell culture with high initial cell density 106 cfu ml could produce enough 2 4 6 tca 267 ng l however when 2 4 6 tcp dosage increased to 1 0 μg all cell cultures could produce enough 2 4 6 tca 207 321 ng l in order to lower the detection limit of mpn method especially for the samples with low omppb numbers high precursor dosage 1 0 μg should be recommended after optimizing the key parameters the accuracy of this method was validated as shown in fig 3 d the result illustrates a linear relationship between the mpn and the pcn with the slope equal to 0 8878 r2 0 9765 the strong correlation indicated the feasibility of using mpn method to estimate the quantities of omppb in dw unfortunately the omppb capable of methylating carboxylic compounds were excluded when determining omppb mpn in this study because z001 can not use carboxylic compounds and no other suitable bacterial strains were available so far 3 3 2 calculation of omppb numbers the established mpn method was performed to enumerate cultivable omppb numbers in all water samples the positive reaction counts over number of total replicates at each dilution level are listed in table 1 and mpns with a 95 confidence limit of cultivable omppb were calculated based on the positive reaction counts at dilution levels in general samples from jx contained relatively higher cultivable omppb numbers 4 3 103 2 9 105 mpn ml than xl 1 6 102 4 3 104 mpn ml and nx 8 0 4 3 104 mpn ml the processes in all dwtps performed decent removal efficiencies towards omppb by reducing 2 to 3 logs of mpns which was mainly due to the contribution of disinfection unit however si fig s3 showed the ratio of omppb mpn and hpc number mpn hpc increased greatly from the rw samples 11 2 21 4 to the cwt samples 40 0 56 8 demonstrating the cultivable omppb gradually dominated the cultivable bacterial community during dw treatment thus our results found that although the quantities of omppb dropped in dwtps the proportion of omppb in bacterial community increased on the contrary 3 3 3 analysis of relationship between ompfp and omppb mpn in order to assess the relationship between omppb mpn and total hafps a regression analysis with 95 prediction interval was performed fig 4 a c show that in each dwtp total hafps could correlate well with omppb mpn in a linear model under log scale r2 0 655 0 898 therefore three prediction functions xl y 0 496 0 373 jx y 0 041 0 465 nx y 0 218 0 237 were obtained accordingly as shown in fig 4 d under the same mpn level the omppb in xl could produce more has followed by jx and nx mpn methods are widely used to quantify microbes with certain metabolic function in the environments such as fecal coliform fu et al 2021 denitrifying and nitrate reducing bacteria boellmann and martienssen 2020 opportunistic pathogen niu et al 2022 etc george and häggblom 2008 employed an mpn assay to measure the number of o methylating microbes in marsh sediments however that method might take 45 days to obtain the result in our study a mpn method within five days was successfully established and applied to quantify the cultivable omppb in water samples from dwtps omppb mpns differed largely in dwtps from different source water and varied through the treatment processes the relatively high mpn hpc suggested the proportion of omppb in the dw bacterial community might be far beyond our imagination which further emphasizes the complexity and importance of the omppb investigation however the present mpn method was based on cell cultivation in liquid medium the non cultivable omppb can not be measured additionally mpn relies on the principle of statistics so that the result of mpn is just an estimated bacteria number with the most possibility cochran 1950 which is different from the actual value in the authors perspective the precise quantification of total omppb is likely to be realized through q pcr method if the functional genes of omppb are available in the future the purpose of quantifying omppb is to assess the omp risk in dw in our previous study zhou et al 2019 a linear correlation between hafp and total bacteria hpc was established in a simulated dwds reactor which was not precise enough due to the use of hpc instead of the omppb number for improvement this work established the relationship between omppb mpn and ompfp in each dwtp the different regression functions in three dwtps illustrated that the omp pollution risk can not only be determined by the quantity of omppb but also the average o methylating ability of each omppb cell 3 4 investigation of cultivable omppb 3 4 1 identification and phylogenetic analysis of cultivable omppb 105 bacterial strains with distinguishing colony shapes were isolated from the water samples of three dwtps among which 28 isolates 10 in xl five in jx and 13 in nx were proved to have o methylating abilities these omppb were identified through 16s full length sequencing and the results are shown in si table s5 based on the blast results all strains showed 97 100 sequence similarity to their closet database entries which belonged to 19 different species it is worth noting that the genera of bacillus erythrobacter pelomonas brevundimonas paenibacillus ralstonia chromobacterium bradyrhizobium xanthobacter and caulobacter were newly found omppb genera to our knowledge which further expands the family of o methylating microbes moreover phylogenetic relationships of 28 strains were determined with the 16s rrna gene tree calculated and constructed by nj algorithm fig 5 a nine 11 and one species were affiliated with the class of alphaproteobacteria betaproteobacteria and gammaproteobactera respectively within phylum proteobacteria the most dominant bacterial phylum in dw while seven species belonged to class bacilli within phylum bacillota 3 4 2 determination of omppcs as shown in fig 5 b the omppcs varied significantly among all omppb strains ranging from 8 5 10 12 ng cfu to 2 3 10 9 ng cfu bradyrhizobium frederickii nxsft 16 exhibited the most remarkable omppc which preferred to produce 2 4 6 tca 1 7 10 9 ng cfu followed by pca 3 86 10 10 ng cfu and 2 4 6 tba 1 92 10 10 ng cfu bacillus australimaris xlst 11 showed comparable omppc 1 31 10 9 ng cfu while it could only produce pca similarly other bacillus strains including bacillus aerius jxrw 4 nxoct 9 bacillus velezensis nxst 7 and bacillus australimaris nxsft 15 also preferred or only produced pca showing the preference of bacillus s omts for methylating pcp rather than other precursors however the preference of omts might be different among strains belonging to the same species four ralstonia mannitolilytica stranis nxsft 4 nxsft 5 nxsft 7 and nxsft 8 could only produce pca while ralstonia mannitolilytica jxsft 1 could produce 2 4 6 tca and 2 4 6 tba in order to obtain clearer classification of the omppb strains in terms of o methylation a hierarchical clustering tree fig 5 c was developed based on the euclidean distance of omppcs the strains were clustered into 16 subbranches among which only two subbranches colored in red and bright green contained more than two strains in each subbranch indicating the high diversities of omppcs of these omppb the strains from the effluents of sft and acft were both classified into six subbranches demonstrating the omppb in filtration units may have multiple o methylating abilities in this study a bradyrhizobium frederickii isolated from the effluent of sft showed the best omppc among all the omppb bradyrhizobium is the dominant genus in the filters gerrity et al 2018 yonkyu et al 2019 which is likely because of its strong ability to secrete extracellular polymeric substances eps that can help cell attach to the filter media skorupska et al 2006 it was reported that bradyrhizobium played an important role in aromatics degradation oh et al 2018 and our study proves that o methylation is likely involved in the degradation pathways as a nitrogen fixing bacterium bradyrhizobium needs to absorb iron for the synthesis of enzymes involved in nitrogen fixation lesueur et al 1993 our previous study revealed that appropriate amount of fe3 could promote the activity of mom zhou et al 2021a so that it can be inferred that the presence of fe3 in bradyrhizobium cell may enhance the production of omps five ralstonia mannitolilytica strains with relatively weak omppcs were isolated only from the effluent of sft unit ferreira et al 2012 confirmed that slow sand filtration could efficiently eradicate ralstonia solanacearum a plant pathogen from recycled irrigation water in brazil this evidences suggested that ralstonia can assemble in sft and become potential omp contributors bacillus spps were the most common omppb isolates in our study and distributed widely in rw st sft oct and acft lee et al 2006 reported bacillus cereus could synthesize omt that uses flavonoids containing ortho hydroxyl groups as substrates and can transfer a methyl group to either of two hydroxyl groups our finding further indicated that phenols with single hydroxyl group can also be the substrates of bacillus s omt in cwt samples only one omppb species brevundimonas diminuta was screened brevundimonas belongs to typical disinfectant resistant bacteria which can favourably inhabit in chlorinated or chloraminated dwdss zhang et al 2019a additionally brevundimonas was key functional taxa in phenol stimulated sludges zhang et al 2018b indicating its high tolerance of phenolic compounds than bacteria thus brevundimonas may be the dominant omppb in dwdss in order to explore whether the sequence difference of 16s rrna gene can determine the difference of omppc correlation was established between pairwise 16s rrna gene sequence distance and omppc distance as shown in si fig s4 relatively close correlation was found in alphaproteobacteria si fig s4 a r 0 4569 p 0 005 and betaproteobacteria si fig s4 b r 0 4243 p 0 001 while only the correlation line of betaproteobacteria has a positive slope no significant or close correlation could be found in bacilli si fig s4 c r 0 2091 p 0 363 and all omppb si fig s4 d r 0 2089 p 0 001 the results demonstrate that the omppc distance can not be well described by the pairwise 16s rrna gene sequence distance in most cases recently there has been a desire to predict functional capacity of bacteria based on the marker gene e g 16s rrna gene sequence data deng and huang 2015 however this strategy had limitations in several aspects a well known study showed that three escherichia coli strains had the coincident 16s sequence while they shared only 39 2 of their combined set of proteins welch et al 2002 similarly henson et al 2015 reported that three hexavalent chromium cr vi reducing microbacterium spp showed varying chromate responses despite their identical 16s rrna gene sequences sevigny et al 2019 quantified the correlation between phylogenetic gene and functional capacity through a large scale analysis the authors observed that 16s rrna gene was not appropriate to predict the functional capacity and additional marker genes should be examined our results further confirmed the limited prediction ability of 16s rrna gene the authors look forward that with the increasing knowledge of omt gene sequence in the future it can be an alternative for better predicting the omppc difference between omppb strains 3 4 3 evaluaion of environment risks of omppb the omppb strains were further evaluated in terms of the risks of produced omps in three aspects the result showed that 28 strains could be roughly aggregated in two groups fig 6 the left group contains seven strains producing omps with relatively low ois 7 7 10 5 5 5 10 3 but the highest abf 2452 the right group includes 21 strains which produce omps with varying abfs and tis but relatively high ois 9 3 10 2 63 the results illustrated that odor issues rather than toxicity problems should be considered firstly for the most omppb however the strain b australimaris xlst 11 which could produce the most toxic omp pca can not be ignored in this study since the high abf of pca might amplify the health risks to the consumers the previous studies related to mom in dw mostly emphasized the risks of t o while ignored the risks of bioaccumulation and toxicity as the precursor of 2 4 6 tba 2 4 6 tbp is a typical toxic halogenated contaminant which has already been found in human maternal 22 pg g ww and cord blood 37 pg g ww as well as in blood samples 81 pg ml lw koch and sures 2018 although the information concerning the 2 4 6 tba concentration in human tissues is largely missing it can be inferred a high potential of 2 4 6 tba accumulation in human body due to the higher bf of 2 4 6 tba than 2 4 6 tbp pca is regarded as the most toxic chloroanisoles due to the high chlorine atom number on its molecular structure reports suggested that pca is genotoxic and associated with an increased incidences of benign pheochromocytomas adrenal tumours and hemangiosarcomas rapid invasive growing cancer of the liver in male mice unep 2013 moreover the reproductive toxicity of pca in rats was manifested as decreased corpora lutea and increased embryolethality unep 2013 therefore our study demonstrates the omppb in dw may cause multiple risks that threaten the health of consumers 3 5 characterization of omppb communities by hts 3 5 1 community structure of omppb according to the omppb genera reported in the references si table s6 and identified in this study 23 omppb genera were selected and their relative abundances in bacterial communities are shown in fig 7 a acinetobacter 0 03 22 13 pseudomonas 0 39 27 78 novosphingobium 0 04 5 08 and paenibacillus 0 06 20 32 could be found in all samples while brachybacterium 0 01 streptomyces 0 01 0 02 erythrobacter 0 01 and xanthobacter 0 01 0 04 only existed in a few samples the asv numbers of omppb exhibited the highest values in xl 173 580 followed by nx 95 166 and jx 37 94 and showed a reduction trend in xl and jx but increased slightly in nx fig 7 b similarly xl samples displayed the highest shannon and pielou s evenness indices followed by nx and jx fig 7 c d indicating the diversity and evenness of omppb communities in xl were better than other two dwtps fig 7 e shows the community structures of omppb were distinct in three dwtps and switched regularly in the direction of treatment process in each dwtp this means dw treatment process may serve as a key drive factor to shape the community structure of omppb many studies have reported that the treatment units in dwtp can shift the bacterial composition in water samples our analysis revealed a consistent fact that from rw to st the proportion of novosphingobium increased from 0 03 0 22 to 0 22 1 09 while the proportion of flavobacterium decreased from 0 01 0 04 to 1 03 1 88 fig 7 a this seems to be in agreement with the study of lin et al 2014 who discovered the relative abundance of novosphingobium raised nearly four times and that of flavobacterium dropped nearly 75 from the feed water to setting pond water sft and acft are medium dependent treatment units in which bacteria can inhabit on the medium surface or inside the medium pore and play an important role in the degradation of organic matters in our results the proportions of pseudomonas and paenibacillus raised in the effluents of sft and acft in all three dwtps signifying these two genera may dominate in sft and acft the capabilities of producing exopolysaccharide or eps by paenibacillus chen et al 2022 and pseudomonas singh et al 2022 wang et al 2022 may help them be enriched in the microbiome in the filters the chlorination step showed a substantial influence on the omppb community structure fig 7 e although the asv numbers of cwt was significantly reduced in xl they unexpectedly showed an rising trend in jx and nx mainly due to the increasing asvs belonging to bacillus paenibacillus pseudomonas and sphingomonas these genera are typical chlorine resistant bacteria and can rapidly recover in cwt after chlorination luo et al 2021 3 5 2 correlation analysis of omppb community and hafp profile in order to confirm whether the hafp profile was determined by omppb community in dw normalized hafp profile matrix si table s7 and normalized omppb community composition matrix si table s8 were correlated by mantel test fig 8 the larger the correlation coefficient and the smaller the p value of the mantel test are the greater the influence of certain omppb genus on the hafp profile as shown in fig 8 total hafp was significantly correlated with mycobacterium mantel s p 0 05 and pelomonas mantel s p 0 05 pca fp was also significantly correlated with pelomonas mantel s p 0 05 while 2 4 6 tca fp had no significant correlation with any omppb genus given that the proportions of mycobacterium and pelomonas were not dominant in omppb community fig 7 a si table s8 it can be inferred that rare omppb taxa might also play key roles in shaping the composition of hafp unfortunately due to the large quantities of the default values in 2 3 6 tca and 2 4 6 tba columns si table s7 mantel test could not be performed between omppb community and 2 3 6 tca fp or 2 4 6 tba fp alone additionally the correlation analysis between omppb genera revealed that pelomonas was negatively correlated with paenibacillus p 0 05 sphingobium p 0 05 and rhodococcus p 0 01 while mycobacterium was not significantly correlated with any other genus in general the hafp profile was strongly influenced by certain important genera in omppb community 3 5 3 evaluation of pomts using picurst2 for functional prediction four phenolic omts and four carboxylic omts were discovered to be the pomts fig 9 among the phenolic omts 3 demethylubiquinol 3 o methyltransferase coq3 had the highest relative abundance followed by caffeoyl coa o methyltransferase ccomt catechol o methyltransferase comt and acetylserotonin o methyltransferase asmt among the carboxylic omts protein glutamate o methyltransferase pgmt protein l isoaspartate d aspartate o methyltransferase pimt and malonyl acyl carrier protein o methyltransferase mamt had the comparable relative abundances while the relative abundances of protein s isoprenylcysteine o methyltransferase pilmt were extremely low and only existed in a few samples it should be noted that the relative abundances of ccomt and asmt were enriched in the effluents of acft and cwt respectively which suggests certain operation units can change the functions of pomts via shaping the omppb community in our previous study zhang et al 2018a only two pomt types comt and ccomt were discovered in the biofilms of three pilot scale dwdss by function prediction based on 16s sequence data the current study revealed six additional pomts compared to the former one indicating that the omt categories and potential o methylation process existed in dwtps are more diverse and complicated than those in dwdss according to the substrate specificity of four phenolic omts comt ccomt and coq3 prefer to use catechol guaiacol and their analogues while only asmt can methylate substrate containing monophenol structure si table s9 therefore asmt is more likely to methylate hps to produce has compared with the rest three phenolic omts the substrates of four carboxylic omts are all amino acid residues of proteins with high molecular weights while so far no evidence has proved that they can catalyze the o methylaion of small molecular carboxylic compounds like dcf unfortunately picurst2 prediction could only provide some superficial knowledge about pomts of omppb in future studies it is believed that some advanced approaches like metagenomics macro transcriptomics and macro proteomics are promising tools to reveal more comprehensive mechanism of mom 3 6 environmental implications in this study cultivation dependent and cultivation independent methods were successfully used to explore the omppb in dwtps cultivation methods revealed the quantity of omppb table 1 as well as the omppc and its characterization of each isolated omppb strain figs 5 b and 6 in water samples which may help us understand whether the omp risk exists in dw and how serious it is as complement to microbial cultivation hts provides us a complete picture of omppb community and the potential dominant omppb genera in each sample cause it involves large quantities of nonculturable bacteria in the community therefore the combination of the two technologies can comprehensively analyze omppb in dw and ought to be introduced to other environmental medium for potential omp risk assessment the results proved that pca and dcfme with high toxicities were generated from two common micropollutants pcp and dcf by omppb in dw fig 2 and many cultivable omppb could only produce toxic pca instead of odorous 2 4 6 tca and 2 4 6 tba these evidences remind us that the role of mom of oh containing compounds should be reassessed in all directions causing t o issues may not the only problem we need to consider when mom happens posing toxic risk to the environment should be also paid much attention moreover apart from phenolic compounds one carboxylic compound dcf was also included in the precursors of mom suggesting the precursor list may be largely expanded in the near future as a result the study of mom of micropollutants mainly has two orientations 1 seeking more potential precursors and 2 evaluating its environmental risks via multiple dimensions the elevated omp concentrations fig 1 ompfps fig 2 and many omppb strains fig 5 in the effluents of sft and acft suggest that the filters may harbor considerable omppb containing intracellular omps they retain in the filter media and are likely to recirculate amongst the filter backwash water fbw due to its high chemical and biological contamination fbw may increase the load of the original treatment units during fbw reuse if it is not purified properly so far several oxidation processes especially o3 uv h2o2 and uv have been proven effectively for removing organic matters and microorganisms in fbw chuang et al 2019 ogura and sabogal paz 2022 zhang et al 2019b however the oxidation of omppb can result in cell broken and the intracellular omps may be released into the water which cause more serious problems therefore alternatives without damaging viable omppb cell should be chosen to treat omppb contaminated fbw recently membrane filtration technologies have been utilized to removal residual microbes in water treatment goswami and pugazhenthi 2020 for instance a hybrid coagulation ultrafiltration uf process was successfully applied to remove heavy metals and coliform in spent fbw mahdavi et al 2018 with the pretreatment of caogulation the average removal rate of total coliform and fecal coliform was 88 and 79 respectively and after uf unit it reached 100 and 100 respectively thus uf associated technologies may be a feasible method in omppb removal from fbw although more evidences are needed to prove its credibility 4 conclusion in this study four omps 2 4 6 tca 2 3 6 tca 2 4 6 tba and pca were detected in dw samples from three dwtps according to ompfp assay ompfps varied significantly among different dwtps and treatment units and the transformation of dcf towards dcfme was firstly proved in dw through an optimized mpn method dw samples from jx were found to contain the highest omppb numbers followed by xl and nx the correlations between total hafps and omppb quantities were well described by a linear model under the log scale 28 out of 105 bacterial isolates from dw samples were proved to have the ability of o methylating hps among them b frederickii preferred to generate 2 4 6 tca and led to off flavor problem while four bacillus spp strains and four r mannitolilytica stranis could only produce pca with toxicity risks hts revealed that treatment processes shaped the omppb communities in dwtps in terms of compositions alpha and beta diversities mantel test showed that hafp profile was strongly influenced by mycobacterium and pelomonas in addition coq3 ccomt comt asmt pgmt pimt mamt pilmt were predicted as pomts via picurst2 analysis to assess and control the omp contamination in dw different aspects odor toxicity and bioaccumulation should be considered in the risk assessment of omppb and the accumulation of omppb in filter units deserve more concerns

15112,aeration is an energy intensive process of aerobic biological wastewater treatment an accurate model of oxygen transfer dynamics in activated sludge tanks would improve design and operation of aeration systems such a model should consider spatial and diurnal variation of α factor as well as site specific conditions that impact oxygen transfer for this dynamic prediction a machine learning approach was used for the first time the data driven method was based on long term ex situ off gas measurements with pilot scale reactors 5 8 m height 8 3 m3 vol coupled to full scale activated sludge tanks on the sites of two conventional and a two stage activated sludge treatment plant the ex situ off gas method allowed to quantify theoretical off gas parameters in non aerated zones and thus consider the whole activated sludge tank we introduced the α0 factor to compare aerated and non aerated zones under nonsteady state conditions like the established α factor for steady state conditions the α0 factor describes oxygen transfer inhibiting effects in activated sludge α0 factor was lowest in upstream denitrification zones this indicates an anoxic elimination of oxygen transfer inhibiting wastewater contaminants which improved oxygen transfer in subsequent aerobic zones random forest models predicted α0 factor reliably in all examined activated sludge tanks even for stormwater events and seasonal variation model development only required online sensor data already available to operators our results suggest that machine learning models can dynamically predict α factors in a variety of activated sludge processes thus considering site specific conditions in model training without manual calibration graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords aeration dynamic α factor data driven model dynamic prediction random forest wastewater treatment data availability data was submitted as csv file and code as jupyter notebook 1 introduction the oxygen transfer in activated sludge systems depends on a wastewater treatment plant s wwtp process layout as well as wastewater and activated sludge characteristics and can be summarized as a three phase system these phases consist of rising air bubbles as the gas phase wastewater with dissolved substances as the liquid phase and particulate substances especially activated sludge flocs as the solid phase accurately modeling the oxygen transfer in activated sludge can lead to significant energy savings bencsik et al 2022 jiang et al 2017 as aeration is an energy intensive process in biological wastewater treatment reardon 1995 rosso et al 2011 the α factor is used to summarize oxygen transfer inhibiting effects as the ratio of oxygen transfer in process water and clean water and can be measured with off gas methods asce 18 18 2018 dwa m 209 2007 recent reviews in the research field of aeration technology discussed several influences on oxygen transfer based on the α factor baquero rodríguez et al 2018 and general modeling of mass transfer in activated sludge amaral et al 2019 research findings from studies conducted over the past decades examined and modeled various influences on oxygen transfer for example wagner and pöpel 1998 investigated the influence of different submergence depths and diffuser densities on oxygen transfer efficiency in clean water oxygen transfer tests gillot et al 2005 performed a dimensional analysis with parameters that describe the tank geometry rosso et al 2005 modeled the effect of specific airflow rate and sludge retention time srt on α factors from a database of off gas measurements collected over 15 years from 30 different activated sludge tanks rosso and stenstrom 2005 reported improved aeration efficiency in conventional activated sludge cas systems with an upstream denitrification stage jiang et al 2017 considered diurnal variations by modeling dynamic α factors based on cod concentrations henkel 2010 developed a model that provides a negative correlation between total suspended solids tss concentration and α factor for tss 6 g l 1 while baquero rodríguez et al 2018 argued that for tss 6 g l 1 a positive correlation with the α factor exists due to biosorption of oxygen transfer inhibiting substances amaral et al 2017 discussed the necessity to include blower performance pressure drop of pipes and diffusers and other tank geometry and controller specific parameters to model gas transfer and bencsik et al 2022 combined several factors into a model e g cod srt tss and position in activated sludge tank to account for spatial and temporal variations of the α factor from a practical point of view reliable modeling of α factors would enable more accurate design and more energy efficient operation of aeration systems than assuming constant α factors ahmed et al 2021 bencsik et al 2022 however although many parameters have been investigated no generally valid model to determine the α factor has been found yet amaral et al 2019 published results are fragmented and differ regarding essential parameters e g geometry and type of aeration system aeration tank layout wwtp process layout and wastewater characteristics consequently there is still no sufficient data base to develop a mechanistic model of oxygen transfer that can be generally applied to aeration systems of any wwtp in recent years application of online measurement for continuous monitoring and process control of wwtps has increased tremendously as sensors have become more reliable online sensors record primary parameters that describe the mass balance of the activated sludge process e g flow rates influent and effluent concentrations of wastewater contaminants and secondary parameters that describe further process conditions e g dissolved oxygen concentration do pressure water temperature electrical conductivity these parameters are commonly used to describe the biological treatment process in wwtps as mechanistic white box models e g activated sludge models asm henze et al 2000 in contrast data driven machine learning ml methods produce black box models where the exact function between an output dependent or response variable and inputs predictor variables or features is unknown a dataset in supervised machine learning consists of pairs of predictor and response variables and is separated into training and test data for cross validation regression methods apply algorithms to find associations between predictor and response variables in numerical training data and thereof produce black box models to quantitatively predict a response variable the effectiveness of a model is evaluated by a performance parameter that is computed from the error between the measured and predicted response variable bishop 2006 james et al 2013 a typical application in wastewater treatment is the forecast of an effluent or influent concentration with a regression model supervised ml however most studies built predictive models based on similar or the same input parameters as asm models thus the potential to build more robust data driven models by including further available parameters was not exhausted so far alejo 2021 in this study we transfer this idea to the outlined challenge of oxygen transfer modeling and use methods of supervised ml to predict α factors based on long term off gas measurements and operating data of three wwtps ideally a model to predict the α factor is based on parameters that describe the three phases involved in oxygen transfer but many such parameters are not easily measurable in activated sludge e g bubble size distribution turbulence surfactant concentration on the other hand secondary variables may correlate with conditions that impact the oxygen transfer such as changing wastewater properties due to stormwater runoff from combined sewers larsen et al 1998 schwarz et al 2021 wilén et al 2006 although the α factor standardizes activated sludge water temperature and electrical conductivity typical decrease due to stormwater inflow could represent rainfall events in a dataset in more detail as a result including operating data that has previously been overlooked in models has the potential to improve prediction performance for this study ex situ off gas measurements were performed for over three years to collect enough data to use ml methods oxygen transfer dynamics of various wwtp process designs were examined including a two stage as treatment plant and two cas wwtps executed as a plug flow reactor pfr and a closed loop reactor clr the objectives of this study were to 1 compare the range of α factors in various wwtp process designs and discuss influence of typical wastewater and activated sludge characteristics on oxygen transfer 2 examine the spatial variation of α factor within activated sludge tanks especially due to upstream anoxic denitrification zones in pfr and clr processes and 3 predict α0 factors with a machine learning model random forest based on operating data of wwtps 2 methodology 2 1 determination of α factors with ex situ off gas columns oxygen transfer parameters and the α factor were determined with pilot scale test reactors performing ex situ off gas tests as described in asce ewri 18 18 2018 the oxygen uptake rate our is measured within the ex situ columns at steady state conditions of dissolved oxygen do by a mass balance of off gas analysis and do concentration to determine oxygen transfer parameters in activated sludge a flow diagram of the process is shown in fig 1 two aeration tanks with duplicate machinery and instruments were used to examine two as zones simultaneously a detailed description of the pilot reactors can be found in schwarz et al 2022 and most notable characteristics are summarized below reactors of dimensions 1 2 m x 1 2 m x 5 8 m l x w x h with a volume of 8 3 m3 were equipped with fine bubble disk diffusers with a density of 13 5 blowers were operated to set airflow rates specified for tank volume within a range of 0 5 to 2 5 nm3 m 3 h 1 sludge transfer was controlled to maintain a hydraulic retention time hrt of 15 min according to asce ewri 18 18 pressure cleaning to remove biofilm growth on diffuser surface and reactor walls was performed monthly and reverse flexing of disk diffusers twice a week to reduce effects of scaling and fouling during long term off gas measurements therefore the α factor is reported without a fouling factor in this study twice a week online sensors were cleaned and gas analyzer was calibrated to ensure proper data recording of instruments clean water oxygen transfer measurements were performed three times at each examined wwtp and averaged to be used as a denominator to determine the α factor pressure loss of diffusers during long term measurements at each wwtp increased by about 1 kpa due to fouling and scaling a comparison measurement has shown that the pilot setup could record α factors with a mean relative standard deviation of about 2 8 2 2 introduction of α0 factor for off gas testing at nonsteady state conditions the ex situ method allows to operate the blowers of the ex situ columns independently from the examined activated sludge tank usually activated sludge is transferred from an aerated zone into an ex situ column and the airflow rate is controlled to maintain do at steady state conditions to replicate conditions of in situ off gas measurements using off gas hoods asce 2018 boyle 1983 do in the ex situ column is maintained at the same concentration as do in the activated sludge tank zone dozone and the α factor is determined as the ratio of standard oxygen transfer rate in process water sotrpw in g h 1 and sotr in clean water sotrcw in g h 1 1 α s o t r p w s o t r c w steady state activated sludge can also be transferred from non aerated tanks this approach therefore allows to determine theoretical α factors in anoxic or anaerobic tank zones under these nonsteady state conditions do in the activated sludge tank dozone and the ex situ off gas column differ to compare α factors in aerated and non aerated zones the mass balance to determine the α factor must be adjusted to consider dozone in the transferred sludge as follows 2 α 0 s o t r p w d o z o n e q a s s o t r c w nonsteady state this adjustment subtracts do in the examined activated sludge tank zone dozone in g m 3 that is transferred to the ex situ column qas in m3 h 1 from sotr in process water sotrpw in g h 1 when operating an ex situ reactor with sludge from a non aerated zone zero dozone no adjustment is made this calculation produces α0 factors that are generally lower than α factors especially the higher the oxygen concentration in the aeration tank is another difference is the oxygen diffusion gradient in the activated sludge tank and ex situ reactor under nonsteady state conditions this difference is considered by standardizing the oxygen transfer efficiency to an oxygen transfer at a base of zero do according to asce 18 18 still activated sludge from an aerated tank zone inevitably includes a gas phase while activated sludge from a non aerated tank zone does not which results in slightly higher α0 factors in aerated zones than in non aerated zones to summarize using the α0 factor improves the comparison of oxygen transfer results between aerated and non aerated zones considerably compared to the α factor α factors based on off gas measurements under steady state conditions are still required to design aeration systems this study exclusively presents results as the α0 factor because of its focus on the oxygen transfer dynamics in different wwtp processes and activated sludge tank zones for further details and a comparison of the α0 and α factor based on parallel measurements see supplementary information section 1 2 3 overview of examined wastewater treatment plants and operating data the pilot reactors were operated over a period of more than three years to perform long term off gas measurements on the sites of three different wwtps process designs included a two stage activated sludge system wwtp a1 and a2 and two cas systems designed as a plug flow reactor wwtp b and a closed loop reactor wwtp c fig 2 presents a flow diagram of the wwtps with layout of biological treatment stages clarifiers and connecting wastewater and sludge flows such as return activated sludge ras waste activated sludge was and internal recirculation it also includes the position of the sludge transfer points across the tank length of each activated sludge tank as a percentage of its total length from inflow to effluent in wwtp b and wwtp c α0 factors were measured in different tank zones while in wwtp a1 and a2 only the inlet zone of each stage was measured the two stage activated sludge plant is separated into a first high rate activated sludge stage a1 red and a second stage for nitrification a2 yellow it has a bypass and recirculation flow and both stages have no internal recirculation nitrate is partially removed in an upstream denitrification zone of the second stage that is also fed with readily biodegradable substrate from the inflow via a bypass the remaining nitrate is removed in a downstream denitrification dn filter a full description of the two stage wwtp a1 a2 can be found in schwarz et al 2021 wwtp b green and c blue are both separated into anoxic aerobic and transition zones the aeration system in the transition zone is controlled depending on ammonia effluent concentration and can be turned off completely during dry weather wwtp b has a relative share of recirculation and ras of about 82 compared to the inflow and the closed loop reactor of wwtp c is operated with agitators at an estimated circulation time of about 35 min to prevent sedimentation about one third of wastewater inflow of wwtp b was from industrial sources while wwtp a and c were primarily treating municipal wastewater from a combined sewer system table 1 lists key operating data to further characterize the examined wwtps in the upper part as well as operation of ex situ columns and the amount of collected off gas data in the lower part data is stated as approximate values or as mean values standard deviation sd the volume specific airflow rate in the activated sludge as tank refers to the respective aerobic tank volume blowers in the ex situ columns were operated to match the airflow rate in the as tank for operation at wwtp a1 and a2 however at the sites of wwtp b and c higher airflow rates were set in the ex situ columns because operation in anoxic zones required higher oxygen transfer to exceed a do concentration of 0 3 mg l 1 required for off gas testing a limitation of the ex situ off gas method is that the airflow rate in the ex situ column affects the determined α factor schwarz et al 2022 therefore a narrow range of volume specific airflow rates was set in the ex situ tanks to avoid a bias of the α0 factor at each wwtp site off gas data was collected over a period that included a seasonal shift of conditions and resultant changes of operation e g water temperature tss and srt collected off gas data was compressed to 1 h intervals this interval is suitable because under ideal mixing conditions at an hrt of 15 min in the ex situ columns about 98 of activated sludge is replaced within 1 h schwarz et al 2022 in total 17 parameters were chosen as predictor variables to train a machine learning model all parameters were derived from continuous operating data from in situ online sensors or ex situ online analyzers these typical instruments were used by wwtp operators for process control and routinely validated and calibrated via laboratory analysis data reconciliation was conducted according to the iwa good modelling practice guidelines rieger 2012 in general the predictor variables collected at all three wwtp sites represented the following criteria wastewater influent concentrations carbon as toc nitrogen as nh4 n and no3 n phosphorus as po4 p mass balance of activated sludge tank with influent and effluent wastewater and sludge recirculation flows state of the activated sludge process airflow rate do ph standardization parameters water temperature electrical conductivity ec atmospheric pressure position along the activated sludge tank some of these basic parameters were further processed to include predictor variables that are typically used for oxygen transfer modeling or to consider measurement related effects these feature engineering approaches included calculation of toc load and toc f m ratio because these parameters are common to describe oxygen transfer inhibition in activated sludge dilution of wastewater inflow due to internal recirculation and return activate sludge e g toc represents the concentration in wastewater inflow whereas tocin considers all inflows of a treatment stage i e supernatant of return activated sludge internal recirculation and bypass flows proportional to their respective water flow time shift to consider delay between online sensor measurement in inflow and off gas monitoring in ex situ column especially when examining rear tank zones see supplementary information section 2 to improve comparability the predictor variables were standardized where possible e g by using a volume specific airflow rate instead of a total airflow rate nonetheless these predictor variables cannot be identical between the wwtp datasets because operators used different sensors or calibration methods for a full list of predictor variables with units values sd and a short description see supplementary information section 3 2 4 training of a random forest model to predict the α0 factor 17 predictor variables as described above and listed in supplementary information section 3 were used to train a machine learning model to predict the α0 factor as a response variable all predictor variables were derived from operating data as provided by the wwtp operators the α0 factor was measured with the ex situ off gas pilot reactors the applied machine learning method was the random forest rf algorithm which is a decision tree based method breiman 2001 random forest trains an ensemble of decision trees which are created by randomly sampling from the training dataset bootstrap sample in addition a split at each node can only use one predictor variable of a randomly selected subset repeating this procedure recursive binary splitting grows trees that are not pruned until a split creates a terminal node which cannot be split without falling below a minimum node size number of remaining observations from the training dataset once the ensemble of trees is trained the final prediction is made by aggregating an average of the predictions of all trees random forest was chosen as a machine learning method for the α0 prediction model because of its proven prediction performance in related fields and its capability to cope with interactions and correlations of predictor variables which are typical in operating data describing wastewater composition tyralis et al 2019 the dataset used in our study includes about 20 000 complete observations of predictor and response variables as 1 h intervals divided for the three wwtps as given in table 1 20 of the data were randomly sampled from the dataset and retained as a test dataset to quantify the prediction performance of the developed random forest models no additional data preprocessing was performed as no transformation of distribution or normalization is required for the application of the random forest algorithm kuhn and johnson 2019 the number of trees in the ensemble ntree was set to 500 and the terminal node size nodesize to 5 the number of randomly selected predictor variables at each node mtry was determined by grid search tuning based on lowest rmse root mean square error with a 10 fold cross validation and 5 repeats to determine the performance of the model the mean values of the parameters rmse r2 coefficient of determination and mae mean absolute error were determined random forest offers the possibility to determine the relative importance of predictor variables svetnik et al 2003 however these variable importance measures are biased towards correlated predictor variables strobl et al 2008 which complicates design of a parsimonious random forest prediction model genuer et al 2010 wwtp operating data contains many correlated variables e g parameters characterizing wastewater contaminants see supplementary information section 5 for a correlation matrix of all predictor and response variables therefore the number of predictor variables in the model is not reduced because of a potential bias in predictor variable selection this has the advantage that model performance for each wwtp can be directly compared based on the same predictor variable set instead of variable importance we examined the effect of missing predictor variables on model performance in case a wwtp operator cannot use a parameter implemented in our prediction models each type of instrument defines a set of predictor variables for example dissolved oxygen sensors are required to determine do in the examined tank zone as well as the average across all aerobic zones both predictor variables would be missing to train a random forest model if no do sensors were available at a wwtp the method to consider missing instruments deleted a set of predictor variables retrained and tuned the random forest model as described above and then compared the model error of the reduced and original model the model error was calculated as a percentage increase of rmse of the reduced model with missing predictor variables and the original model with all predictor variables of random forest predictions on test data statistics and visualization were done using r 3 6 3 r core team 2020 tidyverse package v1 3 0 for visualization wickham et al 2019 data table package v1 14 0 for data handling dowle and srinivasan 2021 caret package v6 0 90 for feature selection cross validation and model training kuhn 2021 and randomforest package v4 7 1 to train regression based random forest models liaw and wiener 2002 3 results and discussion 3 1 overview of wwtp operation and resulting α0 factors the activated sludge stages of the examined wwtps differed in process layout operation and wastewater composition which resulted in a different range of α0 factors see fig 3b a principal component analysis pca was performed on a subset of 8 predictor variables to visualize their correlation in one diagram fig 3a the first two principal components pc1 and pc2 cover a total variance of 65 and predictor variables are represented as arrows loadings loadings pointing in the same direction are positively correlated and vice vera the data points represent the operating data where an α0 factor was recorded with the ex situ off gas method 5000 randomly sampled data points of each wwtp are colored to distinguish the wwtps and complemented by three density lines for each wwtp containing 25 50 and 75 of the available data overall pca shows four clusters of operating data which visualizes that many predictor variables do not overlap between wwtp datasets as an example the high rate activated sludge wwtp a1 was operated at significantly higher airflow rates and toc f m ratios whereas the second stage was operated at higher do setpoints fig 3b shows the resulting α0 factors as an empirical cumulative distribution diagram of the whole dataset the high rate activated sludge system a1 and its second stage a2 had the lowest and highest range of α0 factors respectively overall wwtps with clusters close to each other in the pca also had α0 factors in a similar range although our data represents the examined wwtp s operation in practice fig 3 shows that the available datasets are fragmented and therefore insufficient to develop an oxygen transfer prediction model that is generally applicable to all types of wwtps instead individual models for each wwtp were trained to analyze if a prediction of the α0 factor based on operating data was possible 3 2 spatial and diurnal variation of α0 factor ex situ off gas measurements were performed in aerated and non aerated tank zones to determine α0 factors in successive tank zones of three wwtps divided into anoxic transition and aerobic zones at different intervals of tank length the data presented in fig 4 was collected only during dry weather conditions for better comparison and the amount of data is indicated by a number below the boxplots on average α0 factors increased across the tank length in all reactor types in wwtp b a significant increase was only detected after the initial inflow zone whereas subsequent zones showed similar ranges of α0 factors removal of wastewater contaminants by biosorption and biodegradation in an activated sludge tank across the tank length reduced oxygen transfer inhibition causing a spatial variation of the α0 factor for the first time this effect could also be confirmed by off gas measurements in anoxic zones which suggests an anoxic removal that improved oxygen transfer in down stream aerated zones based on the data the respective impact of biosorption and biodegradation on oxygen transfer improvement cannot be differentiated the concept of spatial variation of α factors although known for decades has just recently been included by bencsik et al 2022 in dynamic oxygen transfer modeling the composition of the wastewater sludge matrix within an activated sludge tank is rarely monitored however the position in a tank is a possible surrogate parameter to describe spatial variation therefore the tank zone is also included as a predictor variable in our machine learning approach in addition to spatial variation α0 factors of the examined wwtps followed a diurnal cycle see fig 5 for wwtp a1 red and a2 yellow α0 factors in the aerobic inflow zone of the aeration tank are plotted for wwtp b green and wwtp c blue in addition to the anoxic inflow zone all subsequent aeration and transition zones are summarized in one diagram other zones the lines represent the course of the percentiles from 5th to 95th percentile the dashed line represents the mean value throughout the day the lines were determined as smoothed functions of the percentiles or mean values of 15 min interval data the peak α0 factors were measured during the daytime rather than at night due to the long residence time of wastewater in the sewer network wwtp a1 shows a distinct peak of the α0 factor whereas diurnal variation of α0 factor in the other wwtps had a more uniform pattern with a less pronounced peak in wwtp a2 the influent load was reduced and buffered by the upstream high rate activated sludge stage a1 and the upstream denitrification zone in wwtp b and particularly in the closed loop reactor of wwtp c influent wastewater was diluted by internal recirculation flows which led to a similar pattern in the anoxic inflow zone and the subsequent zones overall this confirms that the higher the internal recirculation is within an activated sludge tank the flatter the diurnal variation is due to a distribution of the wastewater load rosso and stenstrom 2007 in our machine learning approach time of day was not included as a predictor variable to describe the diurnal pattern of α0 factor bencsik et al 2022 have shown that a sinusoidal pattern of α factors fails to predict oxygen transfer correctly during stormwater events instead in our machine learning approach predictor variables such as tocin were used to consider dilution effects that differ during dry and wet weather conditions 3 3 influence of wastewater load on α0 factor chemical oxygen demand cod is a key parameter to calibrate oxygen transfer prediction models as wastewater load changes dynamically during a day bencsik et al 2022 jiang et al 2017 in our study we used toc to describe influent wastewater characteristics because ex situ toc online analyzers are common in larger wwtps and produce a higher temporal resolution than cod laboratory analysis similarly an inverse relationship between toc f m ratio and α factor exists günkel lange 2013 fig 6 compares α0 factor with toc f m ratio and its individual components i e the actual hydraulic retention time in activated sludge tanks including recirculation flows hrta toc influent concentration including recirculation flows tocin and total suspended solids tss the toc f m ratio is plotted on a logarithmic scale data points are colored and surrounded by density lines as in fig 3 to distinguish the examined wwtps the inverse relationship between α factor and wastewater influent load has been described in previous studies jiang et al 2017 leu et al 2009 for wwtp operators this negative correlation means that oxygen transfer is generally lowest when oxygen demand is highest during high load our collected results from four different activated sludge stages confirm this for tocin fig 6a and toc f m ratio fig 6d however within one wwtp this relationship is superimposed by various other impacts resulting in a less clear relationship it is worth emphasizing that fig 6 presents the available datasets used for machine learning based model development but is not suitable to derive simple linear regression models from it a positive relationship between α factor and tss was proposed by baquero rodríguez et al 2018 they argued that higher tss improves oxygen transfer due to increased biosorption of oxygen transfer inhibiting substances on sludge flocs although our results show this positive relationship between α0 factor and tss concentrations up to 6 g l 1 fig 6b this influence could not be examined isolated from other impacts overall the relevance of this relationship in one individual activated sludge tank remains unclear as tss is usually kept within a narrow range during operation the high rate activated sludge system a1 is operated at significantly lower hrta than the other wwtps fig 6c increased wastewater inflow during rain lowers hrta but a distinct impact on α0 factor cannot be spotted in our data hrta is not a suitable parameter to describe all wastewater characteristics that change oxygen transfer during stormwater inflow models should distinguish first flush with highly loaded wastewater from diluted stormwater overall the bivariate diagrams in fig 6 demonstrate that no individual parameter can be used to reliably predict the α0 factor instead a multivariate approach should be used to model oxygen transfer to consider various superimposed impacts and interaction effects below we present such a data driven methodology 3 4 predicting the α0 factor with random forest four separate random forest models were trained to predict α0 factors based on 17 predictor variables fig 7 shows a comparison of the α0 factors predicted with the random forest models and the α0 factors measured with the ex situ off gas method from the test dataset diagrams on the left are separated into the four activated sludge stages and scaled within the same range wwtps are further distinguished by color and a dashed black linear regression is added in each diagram a density distribution of the prediction error is shown on the right random forest successfully predicted the α0 factor for all wwtp processes the regression line indicates that in each case the prediction of high α0 factors was underestimated and low α0 factors were overestimated this regression towards the mean value occurs because prediction results are averaged at each terminal node in training and across the ensemble of trees for each prediction by random forest algorithm in addition in the upper and lower ranges of the α0 factor fewer training data was available for model training thus potentially reducing model performance a learning curve confirms that model accuracy would benefit from even more training data see supplementary information section 6 an important constraint of many data driven methods is that they are unable to generalize meaning that extrapolation for conditions that are not covered by the training dataset is difficult to accomplish consequently the presented random forest models would lose their predictive power once the wwtp operation or wastewater composition is altered significantly from the observed training data nonetheless the high potential of oxygen transfer predictions with a machine learning method is demonstrated by our results as these are based on long term measurements that include rain weather conditions and seasonal variation furthermore α0 prediction error is in the same range as the density distribution in fig 7 shows even though different wwtp process layouts and resultant α0 factors were examined the random forest performance parameters are listed in table 2 better model accuracy is indicated by lower rmse and mae and higher r2 in our previous study we discussed the measurement uncertainty of ex situ off gas testing and quantified the standard deviation of measurement uncertainty for a series of comparison measurements in wwtp b to 0 018 schwarz et al 2022 a prediction performance undercutting the measurement error would suggest an overfitting model in our case the determined rmse of 0 031 of the random forest model for wwtp b is in the range of the error of the ex situ off gas method suggesting that prediction performance could be limited by the measurement uncertainty of the off gas method predictor variables were selected because they are typically available to monitor the activated sludge process at wwtps some predictor variables correlate with the α0 factor see supplementary information section 5 even without such a correlation a parameter could be relevant to consider interaction effects the random forest algorithm does not require careful selection of predictor variables and can cope with correlated predictor variables guyon and elisseeff 2003 it allows to include parameters that have not been used to predict oxygen transfer before such as water temperature and atmospheric pressure hence the model potentially considers relevant information that has previously been ignored when modeling oxygen transfer in practice a type of instrument used in this study might not be available to include as a predictor variable for model development in some cases this can reduce the model performance as fig 8 shows it illustrates the percentage increase of rmse if a random forest model is trained without a specified set of predictor variables for example not including the predictor variable tank zone in a random forest model for wwtp b increases rmse by more than 60 compared to the random forest model with all predictor variables thus reducing overall model performance the importance of some predictor variables differs between wwtps most notably the spatial variation of α0 factor as described by tank zone is only relevant in models of wwtp b and c that were trained with data from various tank zones see fig 4 likewise tank zone was not relevant in wwtp a1 and a2 because only a small section of the tanks was covered with off gas measurements see fig 2 in some instances predictor variable sets that are highly correlated with each other e g toc n p improved model performance if left out here a more parsimonious model improved rmse by up to 4 a similar improvement was possible with recursive feature elimination see supplementary information section 4 overall this comparison reveals that some of the standardization parameters e g water temperature atmospheric pressure electrical conductivity provided relevant information to improve a random forest based α0 prediction model in contrast parameters usually used in oxygen transfer modeling e g do toc water and sludge flow were less important due to high correlation including all of them did not benefit model accuracy therefore a prediction model could still be developed even though certain instruments were not available at a wwtp it is worth noting that fig 8 only demonstrates which parameters were important for the model predictions in the trained random forest models and cannot evaluate the actual relationship between parameters and α0 factor overall the application of the machine learning based prediction of oxygen transfer is not limited due to missing instruments and sensors to record predictor variables but because off gas testing to monitor the activated sludge tank is rarely implemented in wwtps 3 5 comparison with the current state of dynamic oxygen transfer modeling the dynamic prediction of α factors is a recent focus in the field of aeration technology as dynamic α prediction models by bencsik et al 2022 or jiang et al 2017 show instead of relying on static values dynamic models can improve design and operation of aeration systems as site specific influences on oxygen transfer are considered however it was not possible to develop a generally applicable oxygen transfer model yet previously reported models required calibration and validation based on site specific full scale wwtp data to predict oxygen transfer similarly to our approach consequently the machine learning model presented in this study could not fill this gap either but has unique advantages during model development some examples include previously reported dynamic oxygen transfer models relied on sludge retention time srt to develop or calibrate model parameters srt is often difficult to determine reliably and especially at high temporal resolution varies significantly when waste activated sludge is withdrawn intermittently balbierz and knap 2017 in addition rosso et al 2005 demonstrated the broad range of average α factors for a given srt at numerous wwtps instead of relying on the definition of a wwtp s srt our method can consider all parameters involved in srt as individual predictor variables of a model a kinetic model based on municipal wastewater would have to be extended by new model components in case of industrial wastewaters containing significant amounts of non biodegradable surfactants bencsik et al 2022 in contrast a ml model is automatically adjusted to site specific wastewater characteristics if these are included in a training dataset a ml model could consider effects of fouling and scaling of diffusers on oxygen transfer by including diffuser pressure loss as a predictor variable in a time series analysis this effect was not examined in our study as regular maintenance of diffuser membranes prevented excessive fouling during the experiments selection and engineering of predictor variables could involve additional site specific parameters e g dosage of precipitation chemicals that could further improve prediction performance 4 conclusions a novel oxygen transfer model was presented by applying machine learning methods to predict the α0 factor the data driven approach was based on long term ex situ off gas testing that was conducted on three wwtps including a two stage and two cas systems with different reactor types the key findings are outlined below the spatial and diurnal variation of the α0 factor was confirmed in various reactor types which included ex situ off gas measurements in non aerated anoxic zones for the first time we therefore introduced the α0 factor to compare off gas data from aerated and non aerated activated sludge tank zones measured with pilot scale ex situ off gas reactors this suggests that biosorption and biodegradation of wastewater contaminants in upstream denitrification zones increase α0 factor in successive aerated zones random forest models to predict the α0 factor were trained exclusively with online operating data available to the wwtp operators and did not require extensive laboratory analysis this multivariate approach considered wastewater characteristics treatment plant operation standardization parameters and the spatial variation within an activated sludge tank as predictor variables that were not included in oxygen transfer modeling before model prediction was reliable with an rmse between 0 024 and 0 033 r2 between 0 84 and 0 91 even though the examined activated sludge stages differed regarding their wastewater characteristics or operation the random forest models dynamically predicted α0 factors for regular wwtp operation during stormwater events and seasonal variation like previously reported dynamic oxygen transfer models the machine learning methodology could not create models to reliably predict oxygen transfer under conditions not included in training data the machine learning approach we presented in our study did not require calibration of model parameters the methodology simplifies model development if enough data is available to train a data driven model and therefore benefits from big datasets we reported results for α0 factors to include theoretical spatial variation within the whole activated sludge tank the methodology is also applicable to predict α factors in aerobic stages overall this article invites operators of wastewater treatment facilities to implement continuous off gas monitoring in the activated sludge process even though it is possible to develop an initial model based on temporarily conducted off gas testing highest accuracy can be accomplished when continuous off gas monitoring is implemented in the activated sludge tank multi objective optimizations with a predictive instead of reactive control of the aeration system would benefit from such a model a prospective application of machine learning based oxygen transfer prediction models could be in wwtps with digital twins and supervisory control strategies with multiple control loops for activated sludge tanks collecting off gas data today is going to enable operators to implement better aeration control strategies tomorrow author contributions all authors contributed to the study

15112,aeration is an energy intensive process of aerobic biological wastewater treatment an accurate model of oxygen transfer dynamics in activated sludge tanks would improve design and operation of aeration systems such a model should consider spatial and diurnal variation of α factor as well as site specific conditions that impact oxygen transfer for this dynamic prediction a machine learning approach was used for the first time the data driven method was based on long term ex situ off gas measurements with pilot scale reactors 5 8 m height 8 3 m3 vol coupled to full scale activated sludge tanks on the sites of two conventional and a two stage activated sludge treatment plant the ex situ off gas method allowed to quantify theoretical off gas parameters in non aerated zones and thus consider the whole activated sludge tank we introduced the α0 factor to compare aerated and non aerated zones under nonsteady state conditions like the established α factor for steady state conditions the α0 factor describes oxygen transfer inhibiting effects in activated sludge α0 factor was lowest in upstream denitrification zones this indicates an anoxic elimination of oxygen transfer inhibiting wastewater contaminants which improved oxygen transfer in subsequent aerobic zones random forest models predicted α0 factor reliably in all examined activated sludge tanks even for stormwater events and seasonal variation model development only required online sensor data already available to operators our results suggest that machine learning models can dynamically predict α factors in a variety of activated sludge processes thus considering site specific conditions in model training without manual calibration graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords aeration dynamic α factor data driven model dynamic prediction random forest wastewater treatment data availability data was submitted as csv file and code as jupyter notebook 1 introduction the oxygen transfer in activated sludge systems depends on a wastewater treatment plant s wwtp process layout as well as wastewater and activated sludge characteristics and can be summarized as a three phase system these phases consist of rising air bubbles as the gas phase wastewater with dissolved substances as the liquid phase and particulate substances especially activated sludge flocs as the solid phase accurately modeling the oxygen transfer in activated sludge can lead to significant energy savings bencsik et al 2022 jiang et al 2017 as aeration is an energy intensive process in biological wastewater treatment reardon 1995 rosso et al 2011 the α factor is used to summarize oxygen transfer inhibiting effects as the ratio of oxygen transfer in process water and clean water and can be measured with off gas methods asce 18 18 2018 dwa m 209 2007 recent reviews in the research field of aeration technology discussed several influences on oxygen transfer based on the α factor baquero rodríguez et al 2018 and general modeling of mass transfer in activated sludge amaral et al 2019 research findings from studies conducted over the past decades examined and modeled various influences on oxygen transfer for example wagner and pöpel 1998 investigated the influence of different submergence depths and diffuser densities on oxygen transfer efficiency in clean water oxygen transfer tests gillot et al 2005 performed a dimensional analysis with parameters that describe the tank geometry rosso et al 2005 modeled the effect of specific airflow rate and sludge retention time srt on α factors from a database of off gas measurements collected over 15 years from 30 different activated sludge tanks rosso and stenstrom 2005 reported improved aeration efficiency in conventional activated sludge cas systems with an upstream denitrification stage jiang et al 2017 considered diurnal variations by modeling dynamic α factors based on cod concentrations henkel 2010 developed a model that provides a negative correlation between total suspended solids tss concentration and α factor for tss 6 g l 1 while baquero rodríguez et al 2018 argued that for tss 6 g l 1 a positive correlation with the α factor exists due to biosorption of oxygen transfer inhibiting substances amaral et al 2017 discussed the necessity to include blower performance pressure drop of pipes and diffusers and other tank geometry and controller specific parameters to model gas transfer and bencsik et al 2022 combined several factors into a model e g cod srt tss and position in activated sludge tank to account for spatial and temporal variations of the α factor from a practical point of view reliable modeling of α factors would enable more accurate design and more energy efficient operation of aeration systems than assuming constant α factors ahmed et al 2021 bencsik et al 2022 however although many parameters have been investigated no generally valid model to determine the α factor has been found yet amaral et al 2019 published results are fragmented and differ regarding essential parameters e g geometry and type of aeration system aeration tank layout wwtp process layout and wastewater characteristics consequently there is still no sufficient data base to develop a mechanistic model of oxygen transfer that can be generally applied to aeration systems of any wwtp in recent years application of online measurement for continuous monitoring and process control of wwtps has increased tremendously as sensors have become more reliable online sensors record primary parameters that describe the mass balance of the activated sludge process e g flow rates influent and effluent concentrations of wastewater contaminants and secondary parameters that describe further process conditions e g dissolved oxygen concentration do pressure water temperature electrical conductivity these parameters are commonly used to describe the biological treatment process in wwtps as mechanistic white box models e g activated sludge models asm henze et al 2000 in contrast data driven machine learning ml methods produce black box models where the exact function between an output dependent or response variable and inputs predictor variables or features is unknown a dataset in supervised machine learning consists of pairs of predictor and response variables and is separated into training and test data for cross validation regression methods apply algorithms to find associations between predictor and response variables in numerical training data and thereof produce black box models to quantitatively predict a response variable the effectiveness of a model is evaluated by a performance parameter that is computed from the error between the measured and predicted response variable bishop 2006 james et al 2013 a typical application in wastewater treatment is the forecast of an effluent or influent concentration with a regression model supervised ml however most studies built predictive models based on similar or the same input parameters as asm models thus the potential to build more robust data driven models by including further available parameters was not exhausted so far alejo 2021 in this study we transfer this idea to the outlined challenge of oxygen transfer modeling and use methods of supervised ml to predict α factors based on long term off gas measurements and operating data of three wwtps ideally a model to predict the α factor is based on parameters that describe the three phases involved in oxygen transfer but many such parameters are not easily measurable in activated sludge e g bubble size distribution turbulence surfactant concentration on the other hand secondary variables may correlate with conditions that impact the oxygen transfer such as changing wastewater properties due to stormwater runoff from combined sewers larsen et al 1998 schwarz et al 2021 wilén et al 2006 although the α factor standardizes activated sludge water temperature and electrical conductivity typical decrease due to stormwater inflow could represent rainfall events in a dataset in more detail as a result including operating data that has previously been overlooked in models has the potential to improve prediction performance for this study ex situ off gas measurements were performed for over three years to collect enough data to use ml methods oxygen transfer dynamics of various wwtp process designs were examined including a two stage as treatment plant and two cas wwtps executed as a plug flow reactor pfr and a closed loop reactor clr the objectives of this study were to 1 compare the range of α factors in various wwtp process designs and discuss influence of typical wastewater and activated sludge characteristics on oxygen transfer 2 examine the spatial variation of α factor within activated sludge tanks especially due to upstream anoxic denitrification zones in pfr and clr processes and 3 predict α0 factors with a machine learning model random forest based on operating data of wwtps 2 methodology 2 1 determination of α factors with ex situ off gas columns oxygen transfer parameters and the α factor were determined with pilot scale test reactors performing ex situ off gas tests as described in asce ewri 18 18 2018 the oxygen uptake rate our is measured within the ex situ columns at steady state conditions of dissolved oxygen do by a mass balance of off gas analysis and do concentration to determine oxygen transfer parameters in activated sludge a flow diagram of the process is shown in fig 1 two aeration tanks with duplicate machinery and instruments were used to examine two as zones simultaneously a detailed description of the pilot reactors can be found in schwarz et al 2022 and most notable characteristics are summarized below reactors of dimensions 1 2 m x 1 2 m x 5 8 m l x w x h with a volume of 8 3 m3 were equipped with fine bubble disk diffusers with a density of 13 5 blowers were operated to set airflow rates specified for tank volume within a range of 0 5 to 2 5 nm3 m 3 h 1 sludge transfer was controlled to maintain a hydraulic retention time hrt of 15 min according to asce ewri 18 18 pressure cleaning to remove biofilm growth on diffuser surface and reactor walls was performed monthly and reverse flexing of disk diffusers twice a week to reduce effects of scaling and fouling during long term off gas measurements therefore the α factor is reported without a fouling factor in this study twice a week online sensors were cleaned and gas analyzer was calibrated to ensure proper data recording of instruments clean water oxygen transfer measurements were performed three times at each examined wwtp and averaged to be used as a denominator to determine the α factor pressure loss of diffusers during long term measurements at each wwtp increased by about 1 kpa due to fouling and scaling a comparison measurement has shown that the pilot setup could record α factors with a mean relative standard deviation of about 2 8 2 2 introduction of α0 factor for off gas testing at nonsteady state conditions the ex situ method allows to operate the blowers of the ex situ columns independently from the examined activated sludge tank usually activated sludge is transferred from an aerated zone into an ex situ column and the airflow rate is controlled to maintain do at steady state conditions to replicate conditions of in situ off gas measurements using off gas hoods asce 2018 boyle 1983 do in the ex situ column is maintained at the same concentration as do in the activated sludge tank zone dozone and the α factor is determined as the ratio of standard oxygen transfer rate in process water sotrpw in g h 1 and sotr in clean water sotrcw in g h 1 1 α s o t r p w s o t r c w steady state activated sludge can also be transferred from non aerated tanks this approach therefore allows to determine theoretical α factors in anoxic or anaerobic tank zones under these nonsteady state conditions do in the activated sludge tank dozone and the ex situ off gas column differ to compare α factors in aerated and non aerated zones the mass balance to determine the α factor must be adjusted to consider dozone in the transferred sludge as follows 2 α 0 s o t r p w d o z o n e q a s s o t r c w nonsteady state this adjustment subtracts do in the examined activated sludge tank zone dozone in g m 3 that is transferred to the ex situ column qas in m3 h 1 from sotr in process water sotrpw in g h 1 when operating an ex situ reactor with sludge from a non aerated zone zero dozone no adjustment is made this calculation produces α0 factors that are generally lower than α factors especially the higher the oxygen concentration in the aeration tank is another difference is the oxygen diffusion gradient in the activated sludge tank and ex situ reactor under nonsteady state conditions this difference is considered by standardizing the oxygen transfer efficiency to an oxygen transfer at a base of zero do according to asce 18 18 still activated sludge from an aerated tank zone inevitably includes a gas phase while activated sludge from a non aerated tank zone does not which results in slightly higher α0 factors in aerated zones than in non aerated zones to summarize using the α0 factor improves the comparison of oxygen transfer results between aerated and non aerated zones considerably compared to the α factor α factors based on off gas measurements under steady state conditions are still required to design aeration systems this study exclusively presents results as the α0 factor because of its focus on the oxygen transfer dynamics in different wwtp processes and activated sludge tank zones for further details and a comparison of the α0 and α factor based on parallel measurements see supplementary information section 1 2 3 overview of examined wastewater treatment plants and operating data the pilot reactors were operated over a period of more than three years to perform long term off gas measurements on the sites of three different wwtps process designs included a two stage activated sludge system wwtp a1 and a2 and two cas systems designed as a plug flow reactor wwtp b and a closed loop reactor wwtp c fig 2 presents a flow diagram of the wwtps with layout of biological treatment stages clarifiers and connecting wastewater and sludge flows such as return activated sludge ras waste activated sludge was and internal recirculation it also includes the position of the sludge transfer points across the tank length of each activated sludge tank as a percentage of its total length from inflow to effluent in wwtp b and wwtp c α0 factors were measured in different tank zones while in wwtp a1 and a2 only the inlet zone of each stage was measured the two stage activated sludge plant is separated into a first high rate activated sludge stage a1 red and a second stage for nitrification a2 yellow it has a bypass and recirculation flow and both stages have no internal recirculation nitrate is partially removed in an upstream denitrification zone of the second stage that is also fed with readily biodegradable substrate from the inflow via a bypass the remaining nitrate is removed in a downstream denitrification dn filter a full description of the two stage wwtp a1 a2 can be found in schwarz et al 2021 wwtp b green and c blue are both separated into anoxic aerobic and transition zones the aeration system in the transition zone is controlled depending on ammonia effluent concentration and can be turned off completely during dry weather wwtp b has a relative share of recirculation and ras of about 82 compared to the inflow and the closed loop reactor of wwtp c is operated with agitators at an estimated circulation time of about 35 min to prevent sedimentation about one third of wastewater inflow of wwtp b was from industrial sources while wwtp a and c were primarily treating municipal wastewater from a combined sewer system table 1 lists key operating data to further characterize the examined wwtps in the upper part as well as operation of ex situ columns and the amount of collected off gas data in the lower part data is stated as approximate values or as mean values standard deviation sd the volume specific airflow rate in the activated sludge as tank refers to the respective aerobic tank volume blowers in the ex situ columns were operated to match the airflow rate in the as tank for operation at wwtp a1 and a2 however at the sites of wwtp b and c higher airflow rates were set in the ex situ columns because operation in anoxic zones required higher oxygen transfer to exceed a do concentration of 0 3 mg l 1 required for off gas testing a limitation of the ex situ off gas method is that the airflow rate in the ex situ column affects the determined α factor schwarz et al 2022 therefore a narrow range of volume specific airflow rates was set in the ex situ tanks to avoid a bias of the α0 factor at each wwtp site off gas data was collected over a period that included a seasonal shift of conditions and resultant changes of operation e g water temperature tss and srt collected off gas data was compressed to 1 h intervals this interval is suitable because under ideal mixing conditions at an hrt of 15 min in the ex situ columns about 98 of activated sludge is replaced within 1 h schwarz et al 2022 in total 17 parameters were chosen as predictor variables to train a machine learning model all parameters were derived from continuous operating data from in situ online sensors or ex situ online analyzers these typical instruments were used by wwtp operators for process control and routinely validated and calibrated via laboratory analysis data reconciliation was conducted according to the iwa good modelling practice guidelines rieger 2012 in general the predictor variables collected at all three wwtp sites represented the following criteria wastewater influent concentrations carbon as toc nitrogen as nh4 n and no3 n phosphorus as po4 p mass balance of activated sludge tank with influent and effluent wastewater and sludge recirculation flows state of the activated sludge process airflow rate do ph standardization parameters water temperature electrical conductivity ec atmospheric pressure position along the activated sludge tank some of these basic parameters were further processed to include predictor variables that are typically used for oxygen transfer modeling or to consider measurement related effects these feature engineering approaches included calculation of toc load and toc f m ratio because these parameters are common to describe oxygen transfer inhibition in activated sludge dilution of wastewater inflow due to internal recirculation and return activate sludge e g toc represents the concentration in wastewater inflow whereas tocin considers all inflows of a treatment stage i e supernatant of return activated sludge internal recirculation and bypass flows proportional to their respective water flow time shift to consider delay between online sensor measurement in inflow and off gas monitoring in ex situ column especially when examining rear tank zones see supplementary information section 2 to improve comparability the predictor variables were standardized where possible e g by using a volume specific airflow rate instead of a total airflow rate nonetheless these predictor variables cannot be identical between the wwtp datasets because operators used different sensors or calibration methods for a full list of predictor variables with units values sd and a short description see supplementary information section 3 2 4 training of a random forest model to predict the α0 factor 17 predictor variables as described above and listed in supplementary information section 3 were used to train a machine learning model to predict the α0 factor as a response variable all predictor variables were derived from operating data as provided by the wwtp operators the α0 factor was measured with the ex situ off gas pilot reactors the applied machine learning method was the random forest rf algorithm which is a decision tree based method breiman 2001 random forest trains an ensemble of decision trees which are created by randomly sampling from the training dataset bootstrap sample in addition a split at each node can only use one predictor variable of a randomly selected subset repeating this procedure recursive binary splitting grows trees that are not pruned until a split creates a terminal node which cannot be split without falling below a minimum node size number of remaining observations from the training dataset once the ensemble of trees is trained the final prediction is made by aggregating an average of the predictions of all trees random forest was chosen as a machine learning method for the α0 prediction model because of its proven prediction performance in related fields and its capability to cope with interactions and correlations of predictor variables which are typical in operating data describing wastewater composition tyralis et al 2019 the dataset used in our study includes about 20 000 complete observations of predictor and response variables as 1 h intervals divided for the three wwtps as given in table 1 20 of the data were randomly sampled from the dataset and retained as a test dataset to quantify the prediction performance of the developed random forest models no additional data preprocessing was performed as no transformation of distribution or normalization is required for the application of the random forest algorithm kuhn and johnson 2019 the number of trees in the ensemble ntree was set to 500 and the terminal node size nodesize to 5 the number of randomly selected predictor variables at each node mtry was determined by grid search tuning based on lowest rmse root mean square error with a 10 fold cross validation and 5 repeats to determine the performance of the model the mean values of the parameters rmse r2 coefficient of determination and mae mean absolute error were determined random forest offers the possibility to determine the relative importance of predictor variables svetnik et al 2003 however these variable importance measures are biased towards correlated predictor variables strobl et al 2008 which complicates design of a parsimonious random forest prediction model genuer et al 2010 wwtp operating data contains many correlated variables e g parameters characterizing wastewater contaminants see supplementary information section 5 for a correlation matrix of all predictor and response variables therefore the number of predictor variables in the model is not reduced because of a potential bias in predictor variable selection this has the advantage that model performance for each wwtp can be directly compared based on the same predictor variable set instead of variable importance we examined the effect of missing predictor variables on model performance in case a wwtp operator cannot use a parameter implemented in our prediction models each type of instrument defines a set of predictor variables for example dissolved oxygen sensors are required to determine do in the examined tank zone as well as the average across all aerobic zones both predictor variables would be missing to train a random forest model if no do sensors were available at a wwtp the method to consider missing instruments deleted a set of predictor variables retrained and tuned the random forest model as described above and then compared the model error of the reduced and original model the model error was calculated as a percentage increase of rmse of the reduced model with missing predictor variables and the original model with all predictor variables of random forest predictions on test data statistics and visualization were done using r 3 6 3 r core team 2020 tidyverse package v1 3 0 for visualization wickham et al 2019 data table package v1 14 0 for data handling dowle and srinivasan 2021 caret package v6 0 90 for feature selection cross validation and model training kuhn 2021 and randomforest package v4 7 1 to train regression based random forest models liaw and wiener 2002 3 results and discussion 3 1 overview of wwtp operation and resulting α0 factors the activated sludge stages of the examined wwtps differed in process layout operation and wastewater composition which resulted in a different range of α0 factors see fig 3b a principal component analysis pca was performed on a subset of 8 predictor variables to visualize their correlation in one diagram fig 3a the first two principal components pc1 and pc2 cover a total variance of 65 and predictor variables are represented as arrows loadings loadings pointing in the same direction are positively correlated and vice vera the data points represent the operating data where an α0 factor was recorded with the ex situ off gas method 5000 randomly sampled data points of each wwtp are colored to distinguish the wwtps and complemented by three density lines for each wwtp containing 25 50 and 75 of the available data overall pca shows four clusters of operating data which visualizes that many predictor variables do not overlap between wwtp datasets as an example the high rate activated sludge wwtp a1 was operated at significantly higher airflow rates and toc f m ratios whereas the second stage was operated at higher do setpoints fig 3b shows the resulting α0 factors as an empirical cumulative distribution diagram of the whole dataset the high rate activated sludge system a1 and its second stage a2 had the lowest and highest range of α0 factors respectively overall wwtps with clusters close to each other in the pca also had α0 factors in a similar range although our data represents the examined wwtp s operation in practice fig 3 shows that the available datasets are fragmented and therefore insufficient to develop an oxygen transfer prediction model that is generally applicable to all types of wwtps instead individual models for each wwtp were trained to analyze if a prediction of the α0 factor based on operating data was possible 3 2 spatial and diurnal variation of α0 factor ex situ off gas measurements were performed in aerated and non aerated tank zones to determine α0 factors in successive tank zones of three wwtps divided into anoxic transition and aerobic zones at different intervals of tank length the data presented in fig 4 was collected only during dry weather conditions for better comparison and the amount of data is indicated by a number below the boxplots on average α0 factors increased across the tank length in all reactor types in wwtp b a significant increase was only detected after the initial inflow zone whereas subsequent zones showed similar ranges of α0 factors removal of wastewater contaminants by biosorption and biodegradation in an activated sludge tank across the tank length reduced oxygen transfer inhibition causing a spatial variation of the α0 factor for the first time this effect could also be confirmed by off gas measurements in anoxic zones which suggests an anoxic removal that improved oxygen transfer in down stream aerated zones based on the data the respective impact of biosorption and biodegradation on oxygen transfer improvement cannot be differentiated the concept of spatial variation of α factors although known for decades has just recently been included by bencsik et al 2022 in dynamic oxygen transfer modeling the composition of the wastewater sludge matrix within an activated sludge tank is rarely monitored however the position in a tank is a possible surrogate parameter to describe spatial variation therefore the tank zone is also included as a predictor variable in our machine learning approach in addition to spatial variation α0 factors of the examined wwtps followed a diurnal cycle see fig 5 for wwtp a1 red and a2 yellow α0 factors in the aerobic inflow zone of the aeration tank are plotted for wwtp b green and wwtp c blue in addition to the anoxic inflow zone all subsequent aeration and transition zones are summarized in one diagram other zones the lines represent the course of the percentiles from 5th to 95th percentile the dashed line represents the mean value throughout the day the lines were determined as smoothed functions of the percentiles or mean values of 15 min interval data the peak α0 factors were measured during the daytime rather than at night due to the long residence time of wastewater in the sewer network wwtp a1 shows a distinct peak of the α0 factor whereas diurnal variation of α0 factor in the other wwtps had a more uniform pattern with a less pronounced peak in wwtp a2 the influent load was reduced and buffered by the upstream high rate activated sludge stage a1 and the upstream denitrification zone in wwtp b and particularly in the closed loop reactor of wwtp c influent wastewater was diluted by internal recirculation flows which led to a similar pattern in the anoxic inflow zone and the subsequent zones overall this confirms that the higher the internal recirculation is within an activated sludge tank the flatter the diurnal variation is due to a distribution of the wastewater load rosso and stenstrom 2007 in our machine learning approach time of day was not included as a predictor variable to describe the diurnal pattern of α0 factor bencsik et al 2022 have shown that a sinusoidal pattern of α factors fails to predict oxygen transfer correctly during stormwater events instead in our machine learning approach predictor variables such as tocin were used to consider dilution effects that differ during dry and wet weather conditions 3 3 influence of wastewater load on α0 factor chemical oxygen demand cod is a key parameter to calibrate oxygen transfer prediction models as wastewater load changes dynamically during a day bencsik et al 2022 jiang et al 2017 in our study we used toc to describe influent wastewater characteristics because ex situ toc online analyzers are common in larger wwtps and produce a higher temporal resolution than cod laboratory analysis similarly an inverse relationship between toc f m ratio and α factor exists günkel lange 2013 fig 6 compares α0 factor with toc f m ratio and its individual components i e the actual hydraulic retention time in activated sludge tanks including recirculation flows hrta toc influent concentration including recirculation flows tocin and total suspended solids tss the toc f m ratio is plotted on a logarithmic scale data points are colored and surrounded by density lines as in fig 3 to distinguish the examined wwtps the inverse relationship between α factor and wastewater influent load has been described in previous studies jiang et al 2017 leu et al 2009 for wwtp operators this negative correlation means that oxygen transfer is generally lowest when oxygen demand is highest during high load our collected results from four different activated sludge stages confirm this for tocin fig 6a and toc f m ratio fig 6d however within one wwtp this relationship is superimposed by various other impacts resulting in a less clear relationship it is worth emphasizing that fig 6 presents the available datasets used for machine learning based model development but is not suitable to derive simple linear regression models from it a positive relationship between α factor and tss was proposed by baquero rodríguez et al 2018 they argued that higher tss improves oxygen transfer due to increased biosorption of oxygen transfer inhibiting substances on sludge flocs although our results show this positive relationship between α0 factor and tss concentrations up to 6 g l 1 fig 6b this influence could not be examined isolated from other impacts overall the relevance of this relationship in one individual activated sludge tank remains unclear as tss is usually kept within a narrow range during operation the high rate activated sludge system a1 is operated at significantly lower hrta than the other wwtps fig 6c increased wastewater inflow during rain lowers hrta but a distinct impact on α0 factor cannot be spotted in our data hrta is not a suitable parameter to describe all wastewater characteristics that change oxygen transfer during stormwater inflow models should distinguish first flush with highly loaded wastewater from diluted stormwater overall the bivariate diagrams in fig 6 demonstrate that no individual parameter can be used to reliably predict the α0 factor instead a multivariate approach should be used to model oxygen transfer to consider various superimposed impacts and interaction effects below we present such a data driven methodology 3 4 predicting the α0 factor with random forest four separate random forest models were trained to predict α0 factors based on 17 predictor variables fig 7 shows a comparison of the α0 factors predicted with the random forest models and the α0 factors measured with the ex situ off gas method from the test dataset diagrams on the left are separated into the four activated sludge stages and scaled within the same range wwtps are further distinguished by color and a dashed black linear regression is added in each diagram a density distribution of the prediction error is shown on the right random forest successfully predicted the α0 factor for all wwtp processes the regression line indicates that in each case the prediction of high α0 factors was underestimated and low α0 factors were overestimated this regression towards the mean value occurs because prediction results are averaged at each terminal node in training and across the ensemble of trees for each prediction by random forest algorithm in addition in the upper and lower ranges of the α0 factor fewer training data was available for model training thus potentially reducing model performance a learning curve confirms that model accuracy would benefit from even more training data see supplementary information section 6 an important constraint of many data driven methods is that they are unable to generalize meaning that extrapolation for conditions that are not covered by the training dataset is difficult to accomplish consequently the presented random forest models would lose their predictive power once the wwtp operation or wastewater composition is altered significantly from the observed training data nonetheless the high potential of oxygen transfer predictions with a machine learning method is demonstrated by our results as these are based on long term measurements that include rain weather conditions and seasonal variation furthermore α0 prediction error is in the same range as the density distribution in fig 7 shows even though different wwtp process layouts and resultant α0 factors were examined the random forest performance parameters are listed in table 2 better model accuracy is indicated by lower rmse and mae and higher r2 in our previous study we discussed the measurement uncertainty of ex situ off gas testing and quantified the standard deviation of measurement uncertainty for a series of comparison measurements in wwtp b to 0 018 schwarz et al 2022 a prediction performance undercutting the measurement error would suggest an overfitting model in our case the determined rmse of 0 031 of the random forest model for wwtp b is in the range of the error of the ex situ off gas method suggesting that prediction performance could be limited by the measurement uncertainty of the off gas method predictor variables were selected because they are typically available to monitor the activated sludge process at wwtps some predictor variables correlate with the α0 factor see supplementary information section 5 even without such a correlation a parameter could be relevant to consider interaction effects the random forest algorithm does not require careful selection of predictor variables and can cope with correlated predictor variables guyon and elisseeff 2003 it allows to include parameters that have not been used to predict oxygen transfer before such as water temperature and atmospheric pressure hence the model potentially considers relevant information that has previously been ignored when modeling oxygen transfer in practice a type of instrument used in this study might not be available to include as a predictor variable for model development in some cases this can reduce the model performance as fig 8 shows it illustrates the percentage increase of rmse if a random forest model is trained without a specified set of predictor variables for example not including the predictor variable tank zone in a random forest model for wwtp b increases rmse by more than 60 compared to the random forest model with all predictor variables thus reducing overall model performance the importance of some predictor variables differs between wwtps most notably the spatial variation of α0 factor as described by tank zone is only relevant in models of wwtp b and c that were trained with data from various tank zones see fig 4 likewise tank zone was not relevant in wwtp a1 and a2 because only a small section of the tanks was covered with off gas measurements see fig 2 in some instances predictor variable sets that are highly correlated with each other e g toc n p improved model performance if left out here a more parsimonious model improved rmse by up to 4 a similar improvement was possible with recursive feature elimination see supplementary information section 4 overall this comparison reveals that some of the standardization parameters e g water temperature atmospheric pressure electrical conductivity provided relevant information to improve a random forest based α0 prediction model in contrast parameters usually used in oxygen transfer modeling e g do toc water and sludge flow were less important due to high correlation including all of them did not benefit model accuracy therefore a prediction model could still be developed even though certain instruments were not available at a wwtp it is worth noting that fig 8 only demonstrates which parameters were important for the model predictions in the trained random forest models and cannot evaluate the actual relationship between parameters and α0 factor overall the application of the machine learning based prediction of oxygen transfer is not limited due to missing instruments and sensors to record predictor variables but because off gas testing to monitor the activated sludge tank is rarely implemented in wwtps 3 5 comparison with the current state of dynamic oxygen transfer modeling the dynamic prediction of α factors is a recent focus in the field of aeration technology as dynamic α prediction models by bencsik et al 2022 or jiang et al 2017 show instead of relying on static values dynamic models can improve design and operation of aeration systems as site specific influences on oxygen transfer are considered however it was not possible to develop a generally applicable oxygen transfer model yet previously reported models required calibration and validation based on site specific full scale wwtp data to predict oxygen transfer similarly to our approach consequently the machine learning model presented in this study could not fill this gap either but has unique advantages during model development some examples include previously reported dynamic oxygen transfer models relied on sludge retention time srt to develop or calibrate model parameters srt is often difficult to determine reliably and especially at high temporal resolution varies significantly when waste activated sludge is withdrawn intermittently balbierz and knap 2017 in addition rosso et al 2005 demonstrated the broad range of average α factors for a given srt at numerous wwtps instead of relying on the definition of a wwtp s srt our method can consider all parameters involved in srt as individual predictor variables of a model a kinetic model based on municipal wastewater would have to be extended by new model components in case of industrial wastewaters containing significant amounts of non biodegradable surfactants bencsik et al 2022 in contrast a ml model is automatically adjusted to site specific wastewater characteristics if these are included in a training dataset a ml model could consider effects of fouling and scaling of diffusers on oxygen transfer by including diffuser pressure loss as a predictor variable in a time series analysis this effect was not examined in our study as regular maintenance of diffuser membranes prevented excessive fouling during the experiments selection and engineering of predictor variables could involve additional site specific parameters e g dosage of precipitation chemicals that could further improve prediction performance 4 conclusions a novel oxygen transfer model was presented by applying machine learning methods to predict the α0 factor the data driven approach was based on long term ex situ off gas testing that was conducted on three wwtps including a two stage and two cas systems with different reactor types the key findings are outlined below the spatial and diurnal variation of the α0 factor was confirmed in various reactor types which included ex situ off gas measurements in non aerated anoxic zones for the first time we therefore introduced the α0 factor to compare off gas data from aerated and non aerated activated sludge tank zones measured with pilot scale ex situ off gas reactors this suggests that biosorption and biodegradation of wastewater contaminants in upstream denitrification zones increase α0 factor in successive aerated zones random forest models to predict the α0 factor were trained exclusively with online operating data available to the wwtp operators and did not require extensive laboratory analysis this multivariate approach considered wastewater characteristics treatment plant operation standardization parameters and the spatial variation within an activated sludge tank as predictor variables that were not included in oxygen transfer modeling before model prediction was reliable with an rmse between 0 024 and 0 033 r2 between 0 84 and 0 91 even though the examined activated sludge stages differed regarding their wastewater characteristics or operation the random forest models dynamically predicted α0 factors for regular wwtp operation during stormwater events and seasonal variation like previously reported dynamic oxygen transfer models the machine learning methodology could not create models to reliably predict oxygen transfer under conditions not included in training data the machine learning approach we presented in our study did not require calibration of model parameters the methodology simplifies model development if enough data is available to train a data driven model and therefore benefits from big datasets we reported results for α0 factors to include theoretical spatial variation within the whole activated sludge tank the methodology is also applicable to predict α factors in aerobic stages overall this article invites operators of wastewater treatment facilities to implement continuous off gas monitoring in the activated sludge process even though it is possible to develop an initial model based on temporarily conducted off gas testing highest accuracy can be accomplished when continuous off gas monitoring is implemented in the activated sludge tank multi objective optimizations with a predictive instead of reactive control of the aeration system would benefit from such a model a prospective application of machine learning based oxygen transfer prediction models could be in wwtps with digital twins and supervisory control strategies with multiple control loops for activated sludge tanks collecting off gas data today is going to enable operators to implement better aeration control strategies tomorrow author contributions all authors contributed to the study

15113,karst terrain seasonal monsoonal rainfall is often associated with high concentrations of nitrate n in streams draining agricultural land such high concentrations can pose problems for environmental and human health however the relationship between rainfall events that mobilize nitrate and resulting nitrate export remains poorly understood in karst terrain to better understand the processes that drive nitrate dynamics during rainfall events the characteristics of individual rainfall events were analyzed using sensor technology thirty eight rainfall events were separated from the high frequency dataset spanning 19 months at a karst spring site the results revealed that nitrate discharge n q hysteresis in 79 of rainfall events showed anticlockwise hysteresis loop patterns indicating nitrate export from long distances within short event periods karstic hydrological connectivity and source availability were considered two major determining factors of n q hysteresis gradual increase in hydrological connectivity during intensive rainfall period accelerated nitrate transportation by karst aquifer systems four principal components pcs including antecedent conditions pc1 3 and rainfall characteristics pc2 4 explained 82 of the cumulative variance contribution to the rainfall events multiple linear regression of four pcs explained more than 50 of the variation of nitrate loading and amplitude during rainfall events but poorly described nitrate concentrations and hydro chemistry parameters which may be influenced by other factors e g nitrate transformation fertilization time and water rock interaction although variation of n concentration during event flow is evident accounting for antecedent conditions and rainfall factors can help to predict rainfall event n loading during rainfall events pollution of the karstic catchment occurred by a flush of nitrate input following rainfall events antecedent and rainfall conditions are therefore important factors to consider for the water quality management reducing source availability during the wet season may facilitate to reduction of nitrogen loading in similar karst areas graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords concentration discharge hysteresis rainfall event antecedent conditions hydrological connectivity data availability i have shared the link to my data some data provide in the supplementary information file 1 introduction increasing world population and growing demands on food production have contributed to excessive application of fertilizers in many agricultural landscapes globally gallo et al 2015 gu et al 2015 this has often led to the leaching of nitrogen n in a water soluble form nitrate no3 into surface and ground waters carrey et al 2021 wang et al 2020 elevated concentrations of no3 in water can pose a risk to both aquatic ecosystem health and human health lassaletta et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 with acceptable limits in drinking water sources defined by the world health organisation who as no3 50 mg l no3 concentration no3 n in receiving waters and export from fields farms and catchments is governed by land use and biogeochemical cycling gallo et al 2015 gao and yu 2020 vaughan et al 2017 rainfall events alter water availability in catchments and can mobilize nitrate initiating transport and delivery of increased levels of nitrate loading to receiving waters particularly during heavy or intense storms li et al 2022 rue et al 2017 heavy rain can lead to the saturation of soil within a short period of time accelerate nutrient leaching and thus promote nutrient export wang et al 2020 yang et al 2013 rainfall through its timing intensity and duration is therefore an important factor that can influence nutrient cycling and wider catchment water quality lang et al 2013 ostrom and davis 2019 wollheim et al 2017 as one type of fragile ecosystem the unique karst aquifers can be conceptualized as a dual flow system comprised of underground channels and surface flows ford and williams 2013 previous studies in karst area found that dual flow systems are particularly vulnerable to anthropogenic pollution because of the direct connectivity high transmissivity and poor self purification ford et al 2019 green et al 2019 yang et al 2020 which results in nitrate concentrations frequently exceeding the threshold of drinking water standards ming et al 2020 wang et al 2020 the rapid hydrological response of karst aquifer systems to rainfall events poses a challenge to understanding n behavior during event flow huebsch et al 2014 opsahl et al 2017 recent studies have identified that hydrological and climatological factors such as rainfall characteristics hydrological connectivity and structure can influence nitrate behavior husic et al 2020 wang et al 2023 yue et al 2020 however the influence of these factors on nitrate behavior in karst areas remains unclear previous studies have shown that the relationship between hydrological condition and n behavior can be determined using high frequency monitoring approaches that generate long time series datasets e g annual cycle blaen et al 2017 opsahl et al 2017 rose et al 2018 in situ and online monitoring of no3 n has advanced through developments in high frequency sensor technology duncan et al 2017 kraus et al 2017 this technology can capture the fine scale temporal patterns of nitrate dynamics and help to decrease uncertainty in estimates of nitrate loading to receiving waters relative to low frequency sampling vaughan et al 2017 wollheim et al 2017 these high resolution datasets can also help to further support our understanding of the mechanisms that control nitrate responses during rainfall runoff events e g by identifying key processes responsible for nitrate behavior therefore such datasets record multiple rainfall events of varying characteristics and can inform our understanding of nitrogen transport during high loading export periods in karst landscapes to understand nitrate behavior during rainfall events quantitative analysis of the relationship between nitrate concentration n and discharge q can reveal important information on pollutant source and transfer dynamics in catchments butturini et al 2008 lawler et al 2006 patterns of emergence of concentration c with q during the rising and falling limb of storm hydrographs vary depending on factors such as proximity and magnitude of pollutant source and this results in common typologies of hysteresis liu et al 2021 zhang et al 2016a for example clockwise hysteresis occurs when the pollutant solute concentration peak is ahead of the q peak which suggests that the source of the solute is in close proximity possibly even in stream and transferred rapidly to the receiving water and associated monitoring site lloyd et al 2016a vaughan et al 2017 in contrast anticlockwise hysteresis often reflects a pollutant source that is more distant from the point of monitoring bowes et al 2015 butturini et al 2008 complex hysteretic patterns e g figure of eight patterns comprising clockwise and anticlockwise hysteresis indicate intra catchment solute transport of varying size or a combination of runoff generation processes keesstra et al 2019 coupled with a flushing index fi which signals the directional change in solute concentration at the onset of event flow and at peak flow during rising limb rose et al 2018 vaughan et al 2017 these two indices can indicate timing flushing behavior and proximity of biogeochemical sources keesstra et al 2019 lloyd et al 2016b in addition multivariate statistics of high frequency data e g meteorology concentration discharge and hydro chemical parameters provide insight into solute biogeochemistry during rainfall events as a multivariate statistical method principal component analysis pca can identify the relationship between the original indicator variables and transform them into independent principal components pcs blaen et al 2017 yang et al 2013 based on pca multiple linear regression mlr can be used to estimate the unknown regression coefficient which has been widely used for multiple parameters analysis during rainfall events to identify the mechanism of solute behaviors lawniczak et al 2016 mahler et al 2008 therefore data collected through high frequency sensor technology can provide improved underpinning evidence to support and develop c and q relationship analysis further lloyd et al 2016b the karst terrain in southwestern sw china located in the center of one of the three largest continuous karst areas in the world has an annual rainfall of up to 1600 mm green et al 2019 jiang et al 2014 the monsoon climate drives a strongly seasonal rainfall distribution with more than 70 of annual precipitation delivered during the wet season may to october which coincides with the plant growing season jiang et al 2014 song et al 2017 the wet season is therefore an important period for nitrate export due to increased nitrate loading to land from agricultural activities coupled with the elevated potential for leaching from the soil layer pu et al 2011 yue et al 2019 to date there are no reports of the various characteristics of nitrate behavior e g n q response patterns source area loading during differing hydrological conditions over a long term time series particularly during the key nitrate export periods e g rainfall events understanding this may further benefit effective karst catchment management this study focused on a typical chinese karst landscape where the long term and high resolution characterization of no3 n has previously been reported to be as high as 16 3 mg l among five sites yue et al 2019 to understand nitrate behavior during rainfall events in the karst area one karst spring laoheitan lht with more available long term high frequency data of discharge and nitrate concentration than the other four sites was selected the characteristics of 38 individual rainfall events occurring over 19 months were used to analyze nitrate responses to discharge n q the aims of the present study were to i understand n q response patterns to rainfall events in karst area ii quantify the influence of rainfall runoff events on nitrate export and iii determine what factors e g antecedent conditions rainfall characteristics karst aquatic system and to what extent explain the variance of nitrate export during rainfall events 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area karst geomorphology in sw china includes features such as well developed sinkholes fractures and conduit structures jiang et al 2014 liu 2007 the monitoring site was located at lht in the middle reaches of the houzhai catchment within puding karst critical zone observatory in puding county guizhou province e 26 13 22 4 n105 44 20 4 fig 1 this site was established in 1978 for long term monitoring the lht station drains a 17 69 km2 catchment area with maguan town and the muzudong reservoir mzd re located in the catchment fig 1b the catchment geomorphology changes from high density cone topography with many depressions and very thin soil in the upper reaches of the catchment to forested hillslopes with valleys in the middle reaches natural vegetation including forest shrub and grass accounts for 59 2 of lht sub catchment agricultural land including dryland 21 2 and paddy field 11 5 is mainly distributed within the valley depressions in the upper reaches and across the plains in the middle reaches of the catchment crops grown are typically rice corn canola rotation and vegetables the major crops in summer season are rice corn and various vegetables while crops in the winter season are canola and a few vegetables organic fertilizers such as cattle and pig manure are seasonally applied at the beginning of major crop tillage periods typically for rapeseed november and rice may synthetic fertilizers urea and diammonium phosphate are also applied to land during the growing season may to july for summer crops and november for winter crops the total fertilization amounts to 198 4 224 9 kg ha and n fertilizer contributes 74 5 of fertilizer use liang et al 2020 2 2 in situ sensors sensors were deployed around 100 m downstream of the lht spring fig 1b the nitrate ion selective electrodes nise which auto compensate for cl and temperature were used from may 2016 to the end of october 2017 sensor calibration has been previously reported yue et al 2019 in brief discrete stream water samples were collected manually at weekly or biweekly intervals with additional samples collected during precipitation event periods using an autosampler at short intervals a linear relationship between sensor no3 n and laboratory measured no3 n from discrete samples was used to enable a time interval calibration additionally the uncertainty μc of the time interval calibration was also evaluated and ranged from 0 25 to 0 37 mg l yue et al 2019 hydro chemistry parameters including temperature t electrical conductivity ec ph and dissolved oxygen do were continuously measured at the spring outlet using a multi parameter probe aqua troll 600 calibrated approximately monthly for online discharge monitoring hobo in situ pressure transducers were used for the measurement of water level and q was calculated using the stage discharge relationship at the same location as the nise zhang et al 2021 all in situ sensors measured at 15 minute intervals precipitation data were collected by a meteorological station in lht 2 3 hysteresis indices calculation hysteretic patterns use hysteresis indices hi to quantify the shape size and direction of hysteretic loops of c and q the magnitude of hi can therefore indicate levels of variation between the rising and falling limbs generally one rainfall event was defined as a hydrological response to rainfall which resulted in a well defined q peak comprised of a rising and falling limb with an increase by at least 20 of base flow lloyd et al 2016b however q during the falling limb did not always recover to pre event base flow before a subsequent rising limb was initiated by rainfall and in such cases was defined as another rainfall event lloyd et al 2016b to compare all events together the concentration and q were normalized using the following equations neal et al 2012 1 q i n o r m q i q min q max q min 2 c i n o r m c i c min c max c min where qi ci is discharged concentration at timestep i qmax cmax and qmin cmin are the maxima and minimum discharge concentration during any individual rainfall event respectively qi norm ci norm is the normalized discharge concentration ranging from 0 to 1 to quantify the relationship between q and c lloyd et al 2016a calculated the variation of normalized c at the corresponding level of q in rising and falling limb with different intervals of q 10 100 using eq 3 and defined the hysteresis index hi ranging from 1 to 1 as the average value of hij 3 h i j c j n o r m r i sin g c j n o r m f a l l i n g where cj norm rising cj norm falling are cj norm at measuring point qj norm of the rising and falling limb in this study j 10 20 30 90 some of the cj norm rising data is generated by linear regression of ci using two adjacent measurements at 10 intervals of qi on both the rising and falling limbs vaughan et al 2017 therefore when the solute concentration of the rising limb is higher than in the falling limb at the same normalized q hi is a positive value and suggests the relationship between c and q is clockwise conversely a negative hi value signals anticlockwise hysteresis hi values in the figure of eight can be either positive or negative lloyd et al 2016b 2 4 flushing index calculation to understand better the variation of solute concentrations during rainfall events a flushing index fi was used for further characterization butturini et al 2008 vaughan et al 2017 4 f i c q p e a k n o r m c i n i t i a l n o r m where cq peak norm and cinitial norm are the normalized solute concentrations at the point of peak q and the onset of the rainfall event respectively this index ranges from 1 to 1 and is equal to the slope of the line that intersects the first normalized solute concentration measured in each rainfall event and the normalized solute concentration at peak q a positive value indicates higher concentration or flushing effect in the rising limb and a negative value suggests a decreased concentration or dilution effect in the rising limb 2 5 principal component analysis pca is one of the most successful statistical methods for factor analysis to reduce large dimensionality to smaller intrinsic dimensionality this method uses a linear technique to compute eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalues which can be used to reconstruct a large fraction of the variance of the original data generally the first few eigenvectors or eigenvalues 1 can be interpreted as the principal components which contribute to the vast majority of the system s characteristics thus this method eliminated the correlation between evaluation indicators and greatly reduced the workload of indicator selection and calculation briefly 12 parameters including antecedent characteristics 6 rainfall 4 and discharge characteristics 2 were analyzed to reduce dimensionality using pca table 1 a kaiser meyer olkin test for these parameters returned a value 0 60 confirming that the pca was valid then a polynomial fit analysis was used among nitrate hydrochemistry parameters characteristics and pcs during event flow 3 results 3 1 time series of nitrate n concentration and discharge observations spanned a wet dry wet season cycle and no3 n responded to precipitation and resulting variations in q fig 2 no3 n ranged from 1 4 to 12 4 mg l at this site with average and median values of 5 2 1 4 and 5 1 mg l respectively fig 2a most no3 n maxima were observed during rainfall events occurring earlier in the wet season and periods soon after fertilizer applications with concentrations exceeding both who drinking water standards 11 3 mg l n and china specific standards 10 mg l n water q ranged from 50 to 2536 l s with mean and median values of 234 3 and 223 2 l s respectively fig 2b compared to the annual variation no3 n was higher during the wet season 2017 5 6 1 8 mg l than in the wet season 2016 4 8 1 4 mg l furthermore no3 n during the wet season 2017 was higher than in the dry season 2016 5 1 0 6 mg l and decreased until the intensive rainfall at the beginning of august 2017 fig 2a a total of 44 rainfall events with complete hydrographs and rainfall more than 10 mm which generated discharge higher than the base flow of at least 20 were extracted from the study time series fig 2b the total rainfall associated with all 44 events was 1687 mm which accounted for 74 of all rainfall during the study period 3 events in the dry season 63 mm 21 events during the wet season in 2016 840 mm and 20 events during the wet season in 2017 785 mm the total duration of rainfall that resulted in defined event hydrographs accounted for 26 3 of the study period six rainfall events at the beginning of the studied period fig 2a were incomplete due to missing nitrate n sensor data caused by a loss of power to the sensor or discontinuity in the sensor records because of maintenance consequently only the characteristics of the remaining 38 rainfall events were analyzed the duration of individual events ranged from 15 h to 334 h including 18 events less than 50 h 17 events between 50 h and 100 h and 9 events more than 100 h table s1 three events e22 e23 and e24 during the dry season with low discharge have recorded a duration of more than 200 h the average q resulting from individual rainfall events ranged from 150 to 793 l s the nitrate n loading and q attributed to all rainfall events accounted for 33 and 34 of the study period respectively there were 19 events whereby the nitrate n concentration at end of the defined event was lower than at the beginning of the event table s1 c start end 0 although the nitrate n concentration of event flow during the dry season was greater than part of the wet season nitrate n loading in the dry season was lower than during the wet season generally periods of 12 h precipitation can be categorized into different grades e g moderate rain of 5 14 9 mm heavy rain of 15 29 9 mm storm rain of 30 69 9 mm and heavy storm rain of 70 139 9 mm gb t28592 2012 the n q relationships were determined during events of different rain intensity figure s1 the average no3 n was 7 2 1 5 mg l during moderate rain n 2 5 5 1 3 mg l during heavy rain n 11 5 7 1 5 mg l during storm rain n 20 and 8 6 2 1 mg l during heavy storm rain n 5 briefly the variation of no3 n was small during each moderate rainfall event whereas relatively higher no3 n variation was observed in moderate and heavy storm rainfall events 3 2 analysis of rainfall events and associated indices the number of rainfall events rainfall hi and fi values associated with the three seasons of data collection are shown in table s1 overall no rainfall events exhibited clockwise n q hysteresis relationships while 10 rainfall events generated anticlockwise and negative hi values n q relationships in the other 28 rainfall events resulted in a figure of eight hysteresis loop including 8 clockwise figure of eight loop patterns and 20 anticlockwise figure of eight loop patterns therefore 30 rainfall events 79 show anticlockwise loop patterns greater variation of antecedent conditions was evident in figure of eight events relative to events displaying anticlockwise hysteresis particularly r 3 and sr 3 fig 3 a with respect to rainfall conditions clockwise figure of eight events showed lower r tot and r int but higher r dur and e dur resulting in low q max than the other two patterns figs 3a b and c heavy and short duration rainfall events with short r dur and e dur resulting in high r tot and low q a would form an n q relationship with an anticlockwise loop although anticlockwise and anticlockwise figure of eight have similar average r tot moderate r dur and e dur in anticlockwise figure of eight events resulted in most of them with high q a other characteristics e g r int and q max showed more overlap between anticlockwise and anticlockwise figure of eight events there was no significant variation of hydrochemistry parameters among the three hysteresis patterns fig 3 although a slightly lower ec avg was found in the anticlockwise figure of eight pattern most of the events with a clockwise figure of eight hysteresis loop showed a positive value of c start end indicating that nitrate was diluted whereas negative values of c start end were found in all but one event with an anticlockwise loop fig 3c in addition the range of nitrate concentration during each event c range was highly variable for anticlockwise patterns fig 3d the c avg and c max values were high in anticlockwise pattern events relative to the other two patterns fig 3d which suggested high nitrate export intensity f int in the anticlockwise pattern fi values overlapped among the three hysteresis patterns identified fig 3b and 3c there was no significant response between the flushing index fi and rainfall for example the mean rainfall in events with negative fi values 46 5 23 mm n 8 was higher than in events with positive fi values 33 1 9 8 mm n 7 during the 2016 wet season whereas the converse was true for the 2017 wet season with high mean rainfall found in events with positive values 47 6 27 mm n 11 hi and fi in the 2017 wet season show a negative correlation r2 0 43 p 0 05 but no correlation was observed for the other two seasons fig 4 a 3 3 principal component analysis of rainfall events in karst spring results of the pca identified four components that explained 82 0 of cumulative variance contribution fig 5 the first component explained 35 7 of the variance with positive loading for the antecedent t and sr attribution to the antecedent conditions the second and third components had positive loading for r tot and antecedent rainfall r 3 and r 7 explaining 19 6 and 16 2 of the variance respectively these two components can be classified as rain characteristics which explained the variance equal to the first component the fourth component explained 10 5 of the variance with positive loading for q a and r dur but negative to the r int corresponding to the successive low rainfall events to promote the water yield the multiple linear regression between nitrate characteristics and four pcs indicated the four pcs explained f a f int c range and ec avg more than 50 table 2 moderately explained fi and t avg more than 30 and explained hi c avg and c max less well 25 26 and 21 respectively the four pcs were unable to explain the hydro chemical parameters ph avg and do avg 4 discussion 4 1 source availability and hydrological connectivity determined n q patterns changes in q and no3 n showed a rapid response to rainfall events in this karst spring for example peak q increased more than 9 fold from the base flow level within 4 h and recovered to baseline q levels within the following two days e g e6 e19 e34 this pattern of rapid response is typical of karst dominated catchments because of the wide distribution of sinkholes and dual aquifers with low runoff coefficients that facilitate fast conduit flow chen et al 2018 huebsch et al 2014 such that q returns to base flow conditions more quickly than observed in non karst catchments huebsch et al 2014 jiang et al 2014 as such no3 n showed significant fluctuation and higher concentrations than observed in non karst areas rose et al 2018 wollheim et al 2017 particularly with rising concentration during the falling limb of hydrographs this indicates high availability of nitrate in the catchment transported over distance to the monitoring site and manifest as anticlockwise hysteresis anticlockwise hysteresis has been observed more common in agricultural catchments with high source availability than in urban and forested catchments miller et al 2017 vaughan et al 2017 accumulated nitrate in soil from fertilizer application is likely to be a key factor in such observations hydrological connectivity of catchment networks ranging from uplands hillslopes to the stream has been used to describe the event flow generation process the landscape wets up approaching near saturation of soil and in turn facilitates increased subsurface and overland flow and associated solute transportation mcguire and mcdonnell 2010 wang et al 2023 nitrate loading monitored in the catchment is a function of q and mobilized sources that are delivered to receiving waters previous research has revealed that catchment groundwater rainfall and soil water jointly controlled event flow mcguire and mcdonnell 2010 rose et al 2018 unlike non karst catchments stored water in the karst matrix is replaced by groundwater contributions to represent primary event flow during the early and later stages of an event chen et al 2018 zhang et al 2021 meanwhile limited soil water from thin karstic soil would overlap with new water from rainfall via fast flow and q increase gradually to peak as a result of the direct flow paths linking the surface to underground aquifer systems and enhance hydrological connectivity within the karst catchment during successive rainfall events to clearly show the three n q patterns of the three hysteresis patterns identified adjacent rainfall events during three periods with different hydrological connectivity are provided fig 6 here the n q pattern in the adjacent events e1 4 and 5 is accompanied by a change in hydrological connectivity although moderate r tot in these three events the gradual increase in water yield table s1 q a indicated hydrological connectivity has changed gradually from dry to wet which shortened the nitrate transportation time and led to an increase in flushed nitrate being transported during event flow from epikarst however the low hydrological connectivity during the early wet season cannot effectively transport accumulated nitrate from the whole catchment this limited transport resulted in the exported nitrate area being close to the monitored outlet and being influenced by the event s fast flow to form n q relationship with clockwise figure of eight loop examples of such a response were recorded at the beginning and latter stages of the wet season e1 e21 owing to source accumulation by nitrification and slowdown of growing usage with increases in hydrological connectivity waters of relatively low nitrate concentration were transferred via fast flow with flushed nitrate sources from hillslopes with natural vegetation being transported over long distances to the monitored outlet during events with particularly high nitrate concentrations recorded at the latter stage of event huebsch et al 2014 yue et al 2019 additionally the dual flow system fast and slow flows can also shorten water and nitrate transport time in the heterogeneous karst to a greater extent than in non karst systems and facilitate more efficient mixed solute transport from different land use found in the present study area yang et al 2013 zhang et al 2021 therefore nitrate would be transported from near the monitored site and upper reaches area manifest as n q pattern particularly clockwise figure of eight during intensive rainfall period e g e31 owing to a gradual increase in hydrological connectivity of the catchment periods of intense rainfall occur in the catchment during the wet season but nitrate loading contributions from rainfall are expected to be limited because the major species of nitrogen in rain is ammonium and easily adsorbed by soil zeng et al 2020 furthermore nitrate concentration in rain is normally less than 1 mg l and less than the lowest nitrate concentration in the wet season song et al 2017 zeng et al 2020 rather nitrate concentration during events was diluted by wet precipitation zhang et al 2021 reported that the mean flow age on the rising limb was younger than the falling limb revealing that the rising limb is more influenced by fast flow the dilution effect was more clear during intensive rainfall events as the dominant fast flow with low nitrate concentration integrated with the slow flow with high nitrate concentration yue et al 2019 for example n q patterns displayed anticlockwise e g e35 or figure of eight with more anticlockwise hysteresis e g e34 which is indicative of nitrate being sourced from areas far from the monitored outlet although nitrate concentration may decrease by dilution by multiple hydrological flushes following rainfall events fig 1 increased hydrological connectivity would enhance runoff generation and rapid hydrological transport which resulted in a strong correlation between q a and f a r2 0 80 p 0 01 fig 4b therefore effective source management activities should consider to intercepting or reducing source transportation during high hydrological connectivity periods for example nitrogen fertilizer application e g fertilization level time and types should consider to reducing source availability during intensive rainfall periods in addition farming area should keep away from sinkholes or intercept agricultural overland flow to sinkholes to reduce nitrogen loss by the fast flow n q patterns in the latter stages of the wet season differed from those of intensive rainfall events but were more similar to the pre wet condition events e g e21 e1 e41 e4 e39 e5 indicating source availability and moderate hydrological connectivity controlling n q pattern in pre and latter wet season event flow source availability will increase due to decreased uptake of plants and low hydrological connectivity during the dry season but nitrate produced by nitrification may also accumulate in storage in the epikarst under prolonged dry conditions rusjan et al 2008 positive and high fi values during the dry season with subsequent leaching and transport to receiving waters were driven by rainfall the relatively low rainfall in the dry season is unlikely to leach all nitrate from the soil layer but high fi values suggested a high flushing of a mixture of nitrate from the soil layer and base flow indicating that loading of accumulated nitrate cannot be ignored and may represent a major contributor although in our study hi and fi showed a negative relationship chronological order was not observed in the two wet seasons fig 4a this indicated that the temporal variations in nitrate source and the extent of hydrological connectivity to the karst aquifer system may vary and be further influenced by microbial activities and fertilizer application duncan et al 2017 rue et al 2017 yue et al 2020 4 2 antecedent conditions and source availability determined nitrate loading during rainfall event in karst spring four pcs provided a low level of explanation for nitrate characteristics hi c avg and c max of the events which indicated that other factors might control their observed behavior over time for example although antecedent r sr and t were considered pca and mlr analysis cannot evaluate directly nitrate uptake by plants and nitrate production by nitrification and loss by denitrification in the epikarst system heffernan et al 2012 husic et al 2020 song et al 2017 during the wet season nitrate could be produced from soil organic nitrogen by microbial activities within the catchment and nitrogen inputs from agricultural activities during rainfall events multiple nitrate sources with dynamically varying contributions caused the increase or decrease of nitrate concentration others have observed that fertilizer application and nitrate accumulation in soil were the major reason for high levels of nitrate n lawniczak et al 2016 miller et al 2017 multiple linear regression analysis suggested four pcs that provide a high level of explanation of nitrate export f a and f int in the rainfall events considered in this study high temperature and solar radiation sr i and t i benefit plant growth decreasing nitrogen source availability in farmland and wider catchment however in these antecedent conditions soil water content would decrease and subsequently increase the rate of reactive nitrogen production via mineralization and nitrification li et al 2021 2020 therefore two aspects played a reverse role in nitrogen source availability the comprehensive effect in the present karst catchment showed the antecedent high temperature and solar radiation decreased nitrogen source availability which can be observed from the negative contribution to the f a table 2 in contrast more r tot and successive rainfall events wet up the catchment and therefore promote hydrological connectivity resulting in rapid nitrate transport blaen et al 2017 finally the high q a will increase nitrate n yield f a under high hydrological connectivity within the catchment the mlr among fi and pcs demonstrated that the antecedent conditions pc1 is negative to fi which means that the flushing effect would more obvious when nitrate accumulation followed low sr i and t i e g rainy days therefore accumulated nitrogen sources can be easier to form nitrate peaks before discharge peaks during the following events which can be observed in events with positive hi values and long rainfall intervals particularly in dry season mlr indicated nitrate loading was highly controlled by rainfall characteristics pc2 and pc4 in turn influencing highly variable q and nitrate n export overall antecedent conditions and source availability are key factors influencing nitrate loading observed in other study areas ford et al 2019 husic et al 2019 wymore et al 2016 additionally 74 of observed rainfall generated only 34 of event flow thus the buffering capacity of the epikarst can influence hi c avg and c max zhang et al 2017 given that 74 of observed rainfall generated only 34 of event flow there were more event flows with hi 0 indicating the no3 n during the falling limb may be receding slower than q this lag in the decline of no3 n may be important due to the buffering capacity of the epikarst however no3 n may remain elevated for longer periods than the defined event hydrograph because hydrological connectivity and source transport may be interrupted after rainfall events bowes et al 2015 rue et al 2017 miller et al 2017 found that base flow with a base flow ratio of 69 provided a major contribution to nitrate export 89 from groundwater supply although the well developed karst aquifer system in upper reaches resulted in a low base flow ratio 7 3 the middle reaches plains of the studies sites showed a moderate base flow ratio 41 4 zhang et al 2016b which suggests that the karst matrix was the nitrate reservoir and regulated the chronic of n pollution yue et al 2019 thus it is likely that nitrate dynamics or loading during base flow stored in the karst matrix may be a major driving factor for karst n transport and cannot be underestimated in the present study area chen et al 2018 although the high nitrate concentration can be observed in the present study the major chemical components cations and ions during event flow are ca2 mg2 and hco3 so4 2 respectively qin et al 2020 which contributed to the variation of ec and were controlled by the water rock interaction in karst area pratama et al 2021 yang et al 2013 similar to fi pcs provide a negative contribution to ec avg exhibiting that the dilution effect of rainfall on the chemical components in the fast hydrological karstic system is more obvious than in the non karst areas trudeau and richardson 2016 meanwhile other hydro chemical parameters t avg ph avg do avg presented more complex than non karst areas owing to energy transmission and buffer capacity of epikarst cheng et al 2019 pratt and chang 2012 5 conclusion this study used high frequency nitrate and water level sensor technology in a typical chinese karstic agricultural area rainfall events and their characteristics were extracted from the study period and analyzed by pca and other indices including fi and hi to understand the mechanisms of nitrate export from the karst agricultural area the results indicated that heavy storm rainfall results in greater no3 n in the event flow pca provided further insights regarding event characteristics with four pcs providing 50 explanation of the variation of nitrate loading and amplitude during rainfall events f a f int and c range however these four pcs poorly described nitrate concentrations hi c avg and c max indicating these characteristics may be influenced more by nitrate transformation and source availability than these pcs antecedent conditions and rainfall characteristics determined the hydrological connectivity of catchment which enabled water storage in the karst aquifer to transport nitrate over a long distance the more rapid hydrological connectivity in karst landscapes coupled with high nitrogen source availability during the wet season determined n q patterns resembling figure of eight particularly anticlockwise figure of eight loop patterns results from this study provide new information to further our understanding of the relationship between rainfall event characteristics and resulting nitrate characteristics loading and concentration in the karst area the findings can therefore help to underpin the development of effective land

15113,karst terrain seasonal monsoonal rainfall is often associated with high concentrations of nitrate n in streams draining agricultural land such high concentrations can pose problems for environmental and human health however the relationship between rainfall events that mobilize nitrate and resulting nitrate export remains poorly understood in karst terrain to better understand the processes that drive nitrate dynamics during rainfall events the characteristics of individual rainfall events were analyzed using sensor technology thirty eight rainfall events were separated from the high frequency dataset spanning 19 months at a karst spring site the results revealed that nitrate discharge n q hysteresis in 79 of rainfall events showed anticlockwise hysteresis loop patterns indicating nitrate export from long distances within short event periods karstic hydrological connectivity and source availability were considered two major determining factors of n q hysteresis gradual increase in hydrological connectivity during intensive rainfall period accelerated nitrate transportation by karst aquifer systems four principal components pcs including antecedent conditions pc1 3 and rainfall characteristics pc2 4 explained 82 of the cumulative variance contribution to the rainfall events multiple linear regression of four pcs explained more than 50 of the variation of nitrate loading and amplitude during rainfall events but poorly described nitrate concentrations and hydro chemistry parameters which may be influenced by other factors e g nitrate transformation fertilization time and water rock interaction although variation of n concentration during event flow is evident accounting for antecedent conditions and rainfall factors can help to predict rainfall event n loading during rainfall events pollution of the karstic catchment occurred by a flush of nitrate input following rainfall events antecedent and rainfall conditions are therefore important factors to consider for the water quality management reducing source availability during the wet season may facilitate to reduction of nitrogen loading in similar karst areas graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords concentration discharge hysteresis rainfall event antecedent conditions hydrological connectivity data availability i have shared the link to my data some data provide in the supplementary information file 1 introduction increasing world population and growing demands on food production have contributed to excessive application of fertilizers in many agricultural landscapes globally gallo et al 2015 gu et al 2015 this has often led to the leaching of nitrogen n in a water soluble form nitrate no3 into surface and ground waters carrey et al 2021 wang et al 2020 elevated concentrations of no3 in water can pose a risk to both aquatic ecosystem health and human health lassaletta et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 with acceptable limits in drinking water sources defined by the world health organisation who as no3 50 mg l no3 concentration no3 n in receiving waters and export from fields farms and catchments is governed by land use and biogeochemical cycling gallo et al 2015 gao and yu 2020 vaughan et al 2017 rainfall events alter water availability in catchments and can mobilize nitrate initiating transport and delivery of increased levels of nitrate loading to receiving waters particularly during heavy or intense storms li et al 2022 rue et al 2017 heavy rain can lead to the saturation of soil within a short period of time accelerate nutrient leaching and thus promote nutrient export wang et al 2020 yang et al 2013 rainfall through its timing intensity and duration is therefore an important factor that can influence nutrient cycling and wider catchment water quality lang et al 2013 ostrom and davis 2019 wollheim et al 2017 as one type of fragile ecosystem the unique karst aquifers can be conceptualized as a dual flow system comprised of underground channels and surface flows ford and williams 2013 previous studies in karst area found that dual flow systems are particularly vulnerable to anthropogenic pollution because of the direct connectivity high transmissivity and poor self purification ford et al 2019 green et al 2019 yang et al 2020 which results in nitrate concentrations frequently exceeding the threshold of drinking water standards ming et al 2020 wang et al 2020 the rapid hydrological response of karst aquifer systems to rainfall events poses a challenge to understanding n behavior during event flow huebsch et al 2014 opsahl et al 2017 recent studies have identified that hydrological and climatological factors such as rainfall characteristics hydrological connectivity and structure can influence nitrate behavior husic et al 2020 wang et al 2023 yue et al 2020 however the influence of these factors on nitrate behavior in karst areas remains unclear previous studies have shown that the relationship between hydrological condition and n behavior can be determined using high frequency monitoring approaches that generate long time series datasets e g annual cycle blaen et al 2017 opsahl et al 2017 rose et al 2018 in situ and online monitoring of no3 n has advanced through developments in high frequency sensor technology duncan et al 2017 kraus et al 2017 this technology can capture the fine scale temporal patterns of nitrate dynamics and help to decrease uncertainty in estimates of nitrate loading to receiving waters relative to low frequency sampling vaughan et al 2017 wollheim et al 2017 these high resolution datasets can also help to further support our understanding of the mechanisms that control nitrate responses during rainfall runoff events e g by identifying key processes responsible for nitrate behavior therefore such datasets record multiple rainfall events of varying characteristics and can inform our understanding of nitrogen transport during high loading export periods in karst landscapes to understand nitrate behavior during rainfall events quantitative analysis of the relationship between nitrate concentration n and discharge q can reveal important information on pollutant source and transfer dynamics in catchments butturini et al 2008 lawler et al 2006 patterns of emergence of concentration c with q during the rising and falling limb of storm hydrographs vary depending on factors such as proximity and magnitude of pollutant source and this results in common typologies of hysteresis liu et al 2021 zhang et al 2016a for example clockwise hysteresis occurs when the pollutant solute concentration peak is ahead of the q peak which suggests that the source of the solute is in close proximity possibly even in stream and transferred rapidly to the receiving water and associated monitoring site lloyd et al 2016a vaughan et al 2017 in contrast anticlockwise hysteresis often reflects a pollutant source that is more distant from the point of monitoring bowes et al 2015 butturini et al 2008 complex hysteretic patterns e g figure of eight patterns comprising clockwise and anticlockwise hysteresis indicate intra catchment solute transport of varying size or a combination of runoff generation processes keesstra et al 2019 coupled with a flushing index fi which signals the directional change in solute concentration at the onset of event flow and at peak flow during rising limb rose et al 2018 vaughan et al 2017 these two indices can indicate timing flushing behavior and proximity of biogeochemical sources keesstra et al 2019 lloyd et al 2016b in addition multivariate statistics of high frequency data e g meteorology concentration discharge and hydro chemical parameters provide insight into solute biogeochemistry during rainfall events as a multivariate statistical method principal component analysis pca can identify the relationship between the original indicator variables and transform them into independent principal components pcs blaen et al 2017 yang et al 2013 based on pca multiple linear regression mlr can be used to estimate the unknown regression coefficient which has been widely used for multiple parameters analysis during rainfall events to identify the mechanism of solute behaviors lawniczak et al 2016 mahler et al 2008 therefore data collected through high frequency sensor technology can provide improved underpinning evidence to support and develop c and q relationship analysis further lloyd et al 2016b the karst terrain in southwestern sw china located in the center of one of the three largest continuous karst areas in the world has an annual rainfall of up to 1600 mm green et al 2019 jiang et al 2014 the monsoon climate drives a strongly seasonal rainfall distribution with more than 70 of annual precipitation delivered during the wet season may to october which coincides with the plant growing season jiang et al 2014 song et al 2017 the wet season is therefore an important period for nitrate export due to increased nitrate loading to land from agricultural activities coupled with the elevated potential for leaching from the soil layer pu et al 2011 yue et al 2019 to date there are no reports of the various characteristics of nitrate behavior e g n q response patterns source area loading during differing hydrological conditions over a long term time series particularly during the key nitrate export periods e g rainfall events understanding this may further benefit effective karst catchment management this study focused on a typical chinese karst landscape where the long term and high resolution characterization of no3 n has previously been reported to be as high as 16 3 mg l among five sites yue et al 2019 to understand nitrate behavior during rainfall events in the karst area one karst spring laoheitan lht with more available long term high frequency data of discharge and nitrate concentration than the other four sites was selected the characteristics of 38 individual rainfall events occurring over 19 months were used to analyze nitrate responses to discharge n q the aims of the present study were to i understand n q response patterns to rainfall events in karst area ii quantify the influence of rainfall runoff events on nitrate export and iii determine what factors e g antecedent conditions rainfall characteristics karst aquatic system and to what extent explain the variance of nitrate export during rainfall events 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area karst geomorphology in sw china includes features such as well developed sinkholes fractures and conduit structures jiang et al 2014 liu 2007 the monitoring site was located at lht in the middle reaches of the houzhai catchment within puding karst critical zone observatory in puding county guizhou province e 26 13 22 4 n105 44 20 4 fig 1 this site was established in 1978 for long term monitoring the lht station drains a 17 69 km2 catchment area with maguan town and the muzudong reservoir mzd re located in the catchment fig 1b the catchment geomorphology changes from high density cone topography with many depressions and very thin soil in the upper reaches of the catchment to forested hillslopes with valleys in the middle reaches natural vegetation including forest shrub and grass accounts for 59 2 of lht sub catchment agricultural land including dryland 21 2 and paddy field 11 5 is mainly distributed within the valley depressions in the upper reaches and across the plains in the middle reaches of the catchment crops grown are typically rice corn canola rotation and vegetables the major crops in summer season are rice corn and various vegetables while crops in the winter season are canola and a few vegetables organic fertilizers such as cattle and pig manure are seasonally applied at the beginning of major crop tillage periods typically for rapeseed november and rice may synthetic fertilizers urea and diammonium phosphate are also applied to land during the growing season may to july for summer crops and november for winter crops the total fertilization amounts to 198 4 224 9 kg ha and n fertilizer contributes 74 5 of fertilizer use liang et al 2020 2 2 in situ sensors sensors were deployed around 100 m downstream of the lht spring fig 1b the nitrate ion selective electrodes nise which auto compensate for cl and temperature were used from may 2016 to the end of october 2017 sensor calibration has been previously reported yue et al 2019 in brief discrete stream water samples were collected manually at weekly or biweekly intervals with additional samples collected during precipitation event periods using an autosampler at short intervals a linear relationship between sensor no3 n and laboratory measured no3 n from discrete samples was used to enable a time interval calibration additionally the uncertainty μc of the time interval calibration was also evaluated and ranged from 0 25 to 0 37 mg l yue et al 2019 hydro chemistry parameters including temperature t electrical conductivity ec ph and dissolved oxygen do were continuously measured at the spring outlet using a multi parameter probe aqua troll 600 calibrated approximately monthly for online discharge monitoring hobo in situ pressure transducers were used for the measurement of water level and q was calculated using the stage discharge relationship at the same location as the nise zhang et al 2021 all in situ sensors measured at 15 minute intervals precipitation data were collected by a meteorological station in lht 2 3 hysteresis indices calculation hysteretic patterns use hysteresis indices hi to quantify the shape size and direction of hysteretic loops of c and q the magnitude of hi can therefore indicate levels of variation between the rising and falling limbs generally one rainfall event was defined as a hydrological response to rainfall which resulted in a well defined q peak comprised of a rising and falling limb with an increase by at least 20 of base flow lloyd et al 2016b however q during the falling limb did not always recover to pre event base flow before a subsequent rising limb was initiated by rainfall and in such cases was defined as another rainfall event lloyd et al 2016b to compare all events together the concentration and q were normalized using the following equations neal et al 2012 1 q i n o r m q i q min q max q min 2 c i n o r m c i c min c max c min where qi ci is discharged concentration at timestep i qmax cmax and qmin cmin are the maxima and minimum discharge concentration during any individual rainfall event respectively qi norm ci norm is the normalized discharge concentration ranging from 0 to 1 to quantify the relationship between q and c lloyd et al 2016a calculated the variation of normalized c at the corresponding level of q in rising and falling limb with different intervals of q 10 100 using eq 3 and defined the hysteresis index hi ranging from 1 to 1 as the average value of hij 3 h i j c j n o r m r i sin g c j n o r m f a l l i n g where cj norm rising cj norm falling are cj norm at measuring point qj norm of the rising and falling limb in this study j 10 20 30 90 some of the cj norm rising data is generated by linear regression of ci using two adjacent measurements at 10 intervals of qi on both the rising and falling limbs vaughan et al 2017 therefore when the solute concentration of the rising limb is higher than in the falling limb at the same normalized q hi is a positive value and suggests the relationship between c and q is clockwise conversely a negative hi value signals anticlockwise hysteresis hi values in the figure of eight can be either positive or negative lloyd et al 2016b 2 4 flushing index calculation to understand better the variation of solute concentrations during rainfall events a flushing index fi was used for further characterization butturini et al 2008 vaughan et al 2017 4 f i c q p e a k n o r m c i n i t i a l n o r m where cq peak norm and cinitial norm are the normalized solute concentrations at the point of peak q and the onset of the rainfall event respectively this index ranges from 1 to 1 and is equal to the slope of the line that intersects the first normalized solute concentration measured in each rainfall event and the normalized solute concentration at peak q a positive value indicates higher concentration or flushing effect in the rising limb and a negative value suggests a decreased concentration or dilution effect in the rising limb 2 5 principal component analysis pca is one of the most successful statistical methods for factor analysis to reduce large dimensionality to smaller intrinsic dimensionality this method uses a linear technique to compute eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalues which can be used to reconstruct a large fraction of the variance of the original data generally the first few eigenvectors or eigenvalues 1 can be interpreted as the principal components which contribute to the vast majority of the system s characteristics thus this method eliminated the correlation between evaluation indicators and greatly reduced the workload of indicator selection and calculation briefly 12 parameters including antecedent characteristics 6 rainfall 4 and discharge characteristics 2 were analyzed to reduce dimensionality using pca table 1 a kaiser meyer olkin test for these parameters returned a value 0 60 confirming that the pca was valid then a polynomial fit analysis was used among nitrate hydrochemistry parameters characteristics and pcs during event flow 3 results 3 1 time series of nitrate n concentration and discharge observations spanned a wet dry wet season cycle and no3 n responded to precipitation and resulting variations in q fig 2 no3 n ranged from 1 4 to 12 4 mg l at this site with average and median values of 5 2 1 4 and 5 1 mg l respectively fig 2a most no3 n maxima were observed during rainfall events occurring earlier in the wet season and periods soon after fertilizer applications with concentrations exceeding both who drinking water standards 11 3 mg l n and china specific standards 10 mg l n water q ranged from 50 to 2536 l s with mean and median values of 234 3 and 223 2 l s respectively fig 2b compared to the annual variation no3 n was higher during the wet season 2017 5 6 1 8 mg l than in the wet season 2016 4 8 1 4 mg l furthermore no3 n during the wet season 2017 was higher than in the dry season 2016 5 1 0 6 mg l and decreased until the intensive rainfall at the beginning of august 2017 fig 2a a total of 44 rainfall events with complete hydrographs and rainfall more than 10 mm which generated discharge higher than the base flow of at least 20 were extracted from the study time series fig 2b the total rainfall associated with all 44 events was 1687 mm which accounted for 74 of all rainfall during the study period 3 events in the dry season 63 mm 21 events during the wet season in 2016 840 mm and 20 events during the wet season in 2017 785 mm the total duration of rainfall that resulted in defined event hydrographs accounted for 26 3 of the study period six rainfall events at the beginning of the studied period fig 2a were incomplete due to missing nitrate n sensor data caused by a loss of power to the sensor or discontinuity in the sensor records because of maintenance consequently only the characteristics of the remaining 38 rainfall events were analyzed the duration of individual events ranged from 15 h to 334 h including 18 events less than 50 h 17 events between 50 h and 100 h and 9 events more than 100 h table s1 three events e22 e23 and e24 during the dry season with low discharge have recorded a duration of more than 200 h the average q resulting from individual rainfall events ranged from 150 to 793 l s the nitrate n loading and q attributed to all rainfall events accounted for 33 and 34 of the study period respectively there were 19 events whereby the nitrate n concentration at end of the defined event was lower than at the beginning of the event table s1 c start end 0 although the nitrate n concentration of event flow during the dry season was greater than part of the wet season nitrate n loading in the dry season was lower than during the wet season generally periods of 12 h precipitation can be categorized into different grades e g moderate rain of 5 14 9 mm heavy rain of 15 29 9 mm storm rain of 30 69 9 mm and heavy storm rain of 70 139 9 mm gb t28592 2012 the n q relationships were determined during events of different rain intensity figure s1 the average no3 n was 7 2 1 5 mg l during moderate rain n 2 5 5 1 3 mg l during heavy rain n 11 5 7 1 5 mg l during storm rain n 20 and 8 6 2 1 mg l during heavy storm rain n 5 briefly the variation of no3 n was small during each moderate rainfall event whereas relatively higher no3 n variation was observed in moderate and heavy storm rainfall events 3 2 analysis of rainfall events and associated indices the number of rainfall events rainfall hi and fi values associated with the three seasons of data collection are shown in table s1 overall no rainfall events exhibited clockwise n q hysteresis relationships while 10 rainfall events generated anticlockwise and negative hi values n q relationships in the other 28 rainfall events resulted in a figure of eight hysteresis loop including 8 clockwise figure of eight loop patterns and 20 anticlockwise figure of eight loop patterns therefore 30 rainfall events 79 show anticlockwise loop patterns greater variation of antecedent conditions was evident in figure of eight events relative to events displaying anticlockwise hysteresis particularly r 3 and sr 3 fig 3 a with respect to rainfall conditions clockwise figure of eight events showed lower r tot and r int but higher r dur and e dur resulting in low q max than the other two patterns figs 3a b and c heavy and short duration rainfall events with short r dur and e dur resulting in high r tot and low q a would form an n q relationship with an anticlockwise loop although anticlockwise and anticlockwise figure of eight have similar average r tot moderate r dur and e dur in anticlockwise figure of eight events resulted in most of them with high q a other characteristics e g r int and q max showed more overlap between anticlockwise and anticlockwise figure of eight events there was no significant variation of hydrochemistry parameters among the three hysteresis patterns fig 3 although a slightly lower ec avg was found in the anticlockwise figure of eight pattern most of the events with a clockwise figure of eight hysteresis loop showed a positive value of c start end indicating that nitrate was diluted whereas negative values of c start end were found in all but one event with an anticlockwise loop fig 3c in addition the range of nitrate concentration during each event c range was highly variable for anticlockwise patterns fig 3d the c avg and c max values were high in anticlockwise pattern events relative to the other two patterns fig 3d which suggested high nitrate export intensity f int in the anticlockwise pattern fi values overlapped among the three hysteresis patterns identified fig 3b and 3c there was no significant response between the flushing index fi and rainfall for example the mean rainfall in events with negative fi values 46 5 23 mm n 8 was higher than in events with positive fi values 33 1 9 8 mm n 7 during the 2016 wet season whereas the converse was true for the 2017 wet season with high mean rainfall found in events with positive values 47 6 27 mm n 11 hi and fi in the 2017 wet season show a negative correlation r2 0 43 p 0 05 but no correlation was observed for the other two seasons fig 4 a 3 3 principal component analysis of rainfall events in karst spring results of the pca identified four components that explained 82 0 of cumulative variance contribution fig 5 the first component explained 35 7 of the variance with positive loading for the antecedent t and sr attribution to the antecedent conditions the second and third components had positive loading for r tot and antecedent rainfall r 3 and r 7 explaining 19 6 and 16 2 of the variance respectively these two components can be classified as rain characteristics which explained the variance equal to the first component the fourth component explained 10 5 of the variance with positive loading for q a and r dur but negative to the r int corresponding to the successive low rainfall events to promote the water yield the multiple linear regression between nitrate characteristics and four pcs indicated the four pcs explained f a f int c range and ec avg more than 50 table 2 moderately explained fi and t avg more than 30 and explained hi c avg and c max less well 25 26 and 21 respectively the four pcs were unable to explain the hydro chemical parameters ph avg and do avg 4 discussion 4 1 source availability and hydrological connectivity determined n q patterns changes in q and no3 n showed a rapid response to rainfall events in this karst spring for example peak q increased more than 9 fold from the base flow level within 4 h and recovered to baseline q levels within the following two days e g e6 e19 e34 this pattern of rapid response is typical of karst dominated catchments because of the wide distribution of sinkholes and dual aquifers with low runoff coefficients that facilitate fast conduit flow chen et al 2018 huebsch et al 2014 such that q returns to base flow conditions more quickly than observed in non karst catchments huebsch et al 2014 jiang et al 2014 as such no3 n showed significant fluctuation and higher concentrations than observed in non karst areas rose et al 2018 wollheim et al 2017 particularly with rising concentration during the falling limb of hydrographs this indicates high availability of nitrate in the catchment transported over distance to the monitoring site and manifest as anticlockwise hysteresis anticlockwise hysteresis has been observed more common in agricultural catchments with high source availability than in urban and forested catchments miller et al 2017 vaughan et al 2017 accumulated nitrate in soil from fertilizer application is likely to be a key factor in such observations hydrological connectivity of catchment networks ranging from uplands hillslopes to the stream has been used to describe the event flow generation process the landscape wets up approaching near saturation of soil and in turn facilitates increased subsurface and overland flow and associated solute transportation mcguire and mcdonnell 2010 wang et al 2023 nitrate loading monitored in the catchment is a function of q and mobilized sources that are delivered to receiving waters previous research has revealed that catchment groundwater rainfall and soil water jointly controlled event flow mcguire and mcdonnell 2010 rose et al 2018 unlike non karst catchments stored water in the karst matrix is replaced by groundwater contributions to represent primary event flow during the early and later stages of an event chen et al 2018 zhang et al 2021 meanwhile limited soil water from thin karstic soil would overlap with new water from rainfall via fast flow and q increase gradually to peak as a result of the direct flow paths linking the surface to underground aquifer systems and enhance hydrological connectivity within the karst catchment during successive rainfall events to clearly show the three n q patterns of the three hysteresis patterns identified adjacent rainfall events during three periods with different hydrological connectivity are provided fig 6 here the n q pattern in the adjacent events e1 4 and 5 is accompanied by a change in hydrological connectivity although moderate r tot in these three events the gradual increase in water yield table s1 q a indicated hydrological connectivity has changed gradually from dry to wet which shortened the nitrate transportation time and led to an increase in flushed nitrate being transported during event flow from epikarst however the low hydrological connectivity during the early wet season cannot effectively transport accumulated nitrate from the whole catchment this limited transport resulted in the exported nitrate area being close to the monitored outlet and being influenced by the event s fast flow to form n q relationship with clockwise figure of eight loop examples of such a response were recorded at the beginning and latter stages of the wet season e1 e21 owing to source accumulation by nitrification and slowdown of growing usage with increases in hydrological connectivity waters of relatively low nitrate concentration were transferred via fast flow with flushed nitrate sources from hillslopes with natural vegetation being transported over long distances to the monitored outlet during events with particularly high nitrate concentrations recorded at the latter stage of event huebsch et al 2014 yue et al 2019 additionally the dual flow system fast and slow flows can also shorten water and nitrate transport time in the heterogeneous karst to a greater extent than in non karst systems and facilitate more efficient mixed solute transport from different land use found in the present study area yang et al 2013 zhang et al 2021 therefore nitrate would be transported from near the monitored site and upper reaches area manifest as n q pattern particularly clockwise figure of eight during intensive rainfall period e g e31 owing to a gradual increase in hydrological connectivity of the catchment periods of intense rainfall occur in the catchment during the wet season but nitrate loading contributions from rainfall are expected to be limited because the major species of nitrogen in rain is ammonium and easily adsorbed by soil zeng et al 2020 furthermore nitrate concentration in rain is normally less than 1 mg l and less than the lowest nitrate concentration in the wet season song et al 2017 zeng et al 2020 rather nitrate concentration during events was diluted by wet precipitation zhang et al 2021 reported that the mean flow age on the rising limb was younger than the falling limb revealing that the rising limb is more influenced by fast flow the dilution effect was more clear during intensive rainfall events as the dominant fast flow with low nitrate concentration integrated with the slow flow with high nitrate concentration yue et al 2019 for example n q patterns displayed anticlockwise e g e35 or figure of eight with more anticlockwise hysteresis e g e34 which is indicative of nitrate being sourced from areas far from the monitored outlet although nitrate concentration may decrease by dilution by multiple hydrological flushes following rainfall events fig 1 increased hydrological connectivity would enhance runoff generation and rapid hydrological transport which resulted in a strong correlation between q a and f a r2 0 80 p 0 01 fig 4b therefore effective source management activities should consider to intercepting or reducing source transportation during high hydrological connectivity periods for example nitrogen fertilizer application e g fertilization level time and types should consider to reducing source availability during intensive rainfall periods in addition farming area should keep away from sinkholes or intercept agricultural overland flow to sinkholes to reduce nitrogen loss by the fast flow n q patterns in the latter stages of the wet season differed from those of intensive rainfall events but were more similar to the pre wet condition events e g e21 e1 e41 e4 e39 e5 indicating source availability and moderate hydrological connectivity controlling n q pattern in pre and latter wet season event flow source availability will increase due to decreased uptake of plants and low hydrological connectivity during the dry season but nitrate produced by nitrification may also accumulate in storage in the epikarst under prolonged dry conditions rusjan et al 2008 positive and high fi values during the dry season with subsequent leaching and transport to receiving waters were driven by rainfall the relatively low rainfall in the dry season is unlikely to leach all nitrate from the soil layer but high fi values suggested a high flushing of a mixture of nitrate from the soil layer and base flow indicating that loading of accumulated nitrate cannot be ignored and may represent a major contributor although in our study hi and fi showed a negative relationship chronological order was not observed in the two wet seasons fig 4a this indicated that the temporal variations in nitrate source and the extent of hydrological connectivity to the karst aquifer system may vary and be further influenced by microbial activities and fertilizer application duncan et al 2017 rue et al 2017 yue et al 2020 4 2 antecedent conditions and source availability determined nitrate loading during rainfall event in karst spring four pcs provided a low level of explanation for nitrate characteristics hi c avg and c max of the events which indicated that other factors might control their observed behavior over time for example although antecedent r sr and t were considered pca and mlr analysis cannot evaluate directly nitrate uptake by plants and nitrate production by nitrification and loss by denitrification in the epikarst system heffernan et al 2012 husic et al 2020 song et al 2017 during the wet season nitrate could be produced from soil organic nitrogen by microbial activities within the catchment and nitrogen inputs from agricultural activities during rainfall events multiple nitrate sources with dynamically varying contributions caused the increase or decrease of nitrate concentration others have observed that fertilizer application and nitrate accumulation in soil were the major reason for high levels of nitrate n lawniczak et al 2016 miller et al 2017 multiple linear regression analysis suggested four pcs that provide a high level of explanation of nitrate export f a and f int in the rainfall events considered in this study high temperature and solar radiation sr i and t i benefit plant growth decreasing nitrogen source availability in farmland and wider catchment however in these antecedent conditions soil water content would decrease and subsequently increase the rate of reactive nitrogen production via mineralization and nitrification li et al 2021 2020 therefore two aspects played a reverse role in nitrogen source availability the comprehensive effect in the present karst catchment showed the antecedent high temperature and solar radiation decreased nitrogen source availability which can be observed from the negative contribution to the f a table 2 in contrast more r tot and successive rainfall events wet up the catchment and therefore promote hydrological connectivity resulting in rapid nitrate transport blaen et al 2017 finally the high q a will increase nitrate n yield f a under high hydrological connectivity within the catchment the mlr among fi and pcs demonstrated that the antecedent conditions pc1 is negative to fi which means that the flushing effect would more obvious when nitrate accumulation followed low sr i and t i e g rainy days therefore accumulated nitrogen sources can be easier to form nitrate peaks before discharge peaks during the following events which can be observed in events with positive hi values and long rainfall intervals particularly in dry season mlr indicated nitrate loading was highly controlled by rainfall characteristics pc2 and pc4 in turn influencing highly variable q and nitrate n export overall antecedent conditions and source availability are key factors influencing nitrate loading observed in other study areas ford et al 2019 husic et al 2019 wymore et al 2016 additionally 74 of observed rainfall generated only 34 of event flow thus the buffering capacity of the epikarst can influence hi c avg and c max zhang et al 2017 given that 74 of observed rainfall generated only 34 of event flow there were more event flows with hi 0 indicating the no3 n during the falling limb may be receding slower than q this lag in the decline of no3 n may be important due to the buffering capacity of the epikarst however no3 n may remain elevated for longer periods than the defined event hydrograph because hydrological connectivity and source transport may be interrupted after rainfall events bowes et al 2015 rue et al 2017 miller et al 2017 found that base flow with a base flow ratio of 69 provided a major contribution to nitrate export 89 from groundwater supply although the well developed karst aquifer system in upper reaches resulted in a low base flow ratio 7 3 the middle reaches plains of the studies sites showed a moderate base flow ratio 41 4 zhang et al 2016b which suggests that the karst matrix was the nitrate reservoir and regulated the chronic of n pollution yue et al 2019 thus it is likely that nitrate dynamics or loading during base flow stored in the karst matrix may be a major driving factor for karst n transport and cannot be underestimated in the present study area chen et al 2018 although the high nitrate concentration can be observed in the present study the major chemical components cations and ions during event flow are ca2 mg2 and hco3 so4 2 respectively qin et al 2020 which contributed to the variation of ec and were controlled by the water rock interaction in karst area pratama et al 2021 yang et al 2013 similar to fi pcs provide a negative contribution to ec avg exhibiting that the dilution effect of rainfall on the chemical components in the fast hydrological karstic system is more obvious than in the non karst areas trudeau and richardson 2016 meanwhile other hydro chemical parameters t avg ph avg do avg presented more complex than non karst areas owing to energy transmission and buffer capacity of epikarst cheng et al 2019 pratt and chang 2012 5 conclusion this study used high frequency nitrate and water level sensor technology in a typical chinese karstic agricultural area rainfall events and their characteristics were extracted from the study period and analyzed by pca and other indices including fi and hi to understand the mechanisms of nitrate export from the karst agricultural area the results indicated that heavy storm rainfall results in greater no3 n in the event flow pca provided further insights regarding event characteristics with four pcs providing 50 explanation of the variation of nitrate loading and amplitude during rainfall events f a f int and c range however these four pcs poorly described nitrate concentrations hi c avg and c max indicating these characteristics may be influenced more by nitrate transformation and source availability than these pcs antecedent conditions and rainfall characteristics determined the hydrological connectivity of catchment which enabled water storage in the karst aquifer to transport nitrate over a long distance the more rapid hydrological connectivity in karst landscapes coupled with high nitrogen source availability during the wet season determined n q patterns resembling figure of eight particularly anticlockwise figure of eight loop patterns results from this study provide new information to further our understanding of the relationship between rainfall event characteristics and resulting nitrate characteristics loading and concentration in the karst area the findings can therefore help to underpin the development of effective land

15114,iron release from pipe scale is an important reason for water quality deterioration in drinking water distribution systems dwds globally disruption of pipe scale release and transformation of iron compounds are hot topics in the field of water supply the aim of this study is to determine whether and how ferric components in pipe scale be reduced under anoxic condition in this study new investigation approaches were applied which include simplifying the complex scale into electrode pairs developing novel simulating reactors and conducting tailored electrochemical assays a galvanic cell reactor with anode of metallic iron fe0 and various cathode made of certain iron oxide feox was firstly developed to simulate the complex niche and components of pipe scale electrochemical methods were used to study the reduction characteristics of scale the results proved that reduction of iron oxide scale did occur under anoxic condition electromotive forces between various electrodes match the nernst equation quite well as main components in pipe scale lepidocrocite γ feooh was found to be the most reducible iron oxide but at low rate while goethite α feooh has weak reducibility but can be quickly reduced as a result of electrochemical reactions goethite in pipe scale was transformed into magnetite fe3o4 by these means electrochemical reaction mechanisms of pipe scale disruption were revealed which is helpful to restrain pipe corrosion and water deterioration in dwds graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords pipe scale iron oxide electrochemical reaction kuch mechanism nernst equation drinking water data availability we have shared the data in the supplementary information file 1 introduction adequate and qualified drinking water supply is essential to modern lives drinking water distribution system dwds is a key part of water supply system which suffers water quality deterioration problems due to the biological and chemical stability issues in urban and rural area sarin et al 2001 bei et al 2019 iron pipelines are used widely in dwds around the world because of its high strength moderate cost and good durability iron pipelines have contributed 68 2 of dwds pipelines in the usa and 69 7 in china usepa 2007 cuwa 2017 corrosion and scaling inevitably occur in iron pipelines over the long term oxidation of metallic iron fe0 on pipe surfaces forms iron oxide scale matured pipe scale has a layered structure with in order from the pipe surface a corroded floor a porous core a dense shell like layer and a surface layer of sediments sarin et al 2004a the shell like layer is mainly consisted of magnetite fe3o4 goethite α feooh and smaller proportion of lepidocrocite γ feooh which has a compact and dense structure that inhibits corrosion at pipe surface the porous core contains large amounts of ferrous and ferric compounds and presents a loose and porous structure sarin et al 2001 yang et al 2012 zhang et al 2020 the layered structure of iron scale can be changed when water in pipeline changes from flowing to stagnant and dissolved oxygen do and chlorine depleted ferric oxides in pipe scale can be reduced into ferrous compounds which are more soluble nawrocki et al 2010 liu et al 2017 zlatanović et al 2017 lytle et al 2020 reduction of iron oxides causes protective shell layer to become thinner stable structure to break down and pipe corrosion to accelerate sarin et al 2004b li et al 2012 zhang et al 2014a previous studies of iron release in dwds have been focused on water quality deterioration factors affecting iron release and measures to control iron release vreeburg et al 2007 benson et al 2012 zhang et al 2014b some researchers investigated various influence factors on iron release including oxidants and corrosive ions in an experiment using pipe section reactors made of a 20 year old cast iron pipe iron concentration increased by 0 15 mg l when do concentration in water decreased from 8 0 to 4 9 mg l sun et al 2014 in contrast iron concentration decreased only by 0 07 mg l when do concentration increased from 8 0 to 15 0 mg l hu et al 2018 do concentration of 8 11 mg l in the pipe section reactor controlled iron release effectively sun et al 2014 concentration of released iron also increased markedly when disinfectant concentration in water decreased mi et al 2016 iron release will accelerate if concentrations of corrosive anions e g chloride and sulfate increase and oxidation reduction potential orp is less than 300 mv however iron release will be restrained if orp is higher than 400 mv even if the concentrations of corrosive anions increase mi et al 2015 it is generally believed that the released ferrous and ferric compounds are produced through corrosion or through dissolution of iron oxide products imran et al 2005 liu et al 2013 it is the reduction of iron oxide scale that is key to the iron release because it causes changes in composition and structure of pipe scale at the microscopic level and makes pipe scale to be less stable at the macroscopic level trueman et al 2017 mechanism involved in reduction of iron iii oxides scale under low do concentrations was first proposed by kuch 1988 he found a negative correlation between the rest potential of lepidocrocite and do concentration and then performed theoretical calculations to identify the relationship between current and content of lepidocrocite other researchers also believed that iron release would occur due to chemical and electrochemical reactions in pipe scale under reducing conditions lair et al 2006 vreeburg et al 2007 trueman et al 2017 with the absence of oxygen or chlorine ferric oxides in the shell like layer of scale become the cathode in electrochemical reactions and are reduced to slightly soluble ferrous hydroxide ishikawa et al 2002 magnetite the product of reduction of lepidocrocite can be further reduced to ferrous hydroxide kuch 1988 liu et al 2001 sugae et al 2019 as shown in eqs 1 4 these reactions lead to change and even fracture of pipe scale structure which further cause pipe scale to dissolve become thinner and crack 1 anode f e 2 e f

iron oxide in pipe scale have not been directly verified in experiments first kuch 1988 reported the dynamic of rest potential and current of lepidocrocite in tap water but did not test the potential and current of real galvanic couple i e ferric oxides and metallic iron in scale directly second few previous investigations explored the behavior of pipe scale during electrochemical reactions deeply since the layered structure and amorphous composition of scale are quite complex and difficult to simulate evolution of pipe scale is generally detected indirectly through variation of water chemistry in pipelines therefore the aforementioned processes involved in electrochemical reduction should be simulated more accurately using more ingenious experimental designs and reactors than previous ones more practical and accurate methods are required to investigate pipe scale in dwds electrochemical assays have been widely used to study metal corrosion and scaling processes miyata et al 2002 guo et al 2016 zhang et al 2020 potentiodynamic polarization tests have been used to explore corrosion tendencies and rates frateur et al 1999 impedance spectroscopy can be used to assess the effect of scale layer on iron corrosion barcia et al 2002 cyclic voltammetry can be used to study redox reactions at the electrodes nickchi et al 2019 electrochemical assays have the advantages of in situ real time and high accuracy evolution of pipe scale can be comprehensively investigated using various electrochemical and characterization methods in this study mechanisms involved in electrochemical reduction of iron oxide scale was investigated by new approaches which include simplifying complex pipe scale into electrode pairs made of pure iron oxides developing innovative simulating reactors and conducting tailored electrochemical assays a galvanic cell reactor was set up to simulate operation conditions of pipeline in dwds it can provide direct and precise evidences to confirm the kuch s mechanism of iron oxide scale reduction electrochemical and characterization methods were used to allow the reduction characteristics of various iron oxides in pipe scale to be comprehensively compared the objectives of this study include 1 to simulate reduction reactions of iron oxides under anoxic condition occurring in complex micro niche of pipe scale 2 to investigate processes involved in reduction of scale using various electrochemical assays and tests and 3 to evidence the kuch s mechanism by direct galvanic experiment results as far as the authors know this is the first study in the field of water treatment setting up galvanic cell reactors and applying real pipe scale as the cathode to investigate electrochemical processes upon pipe scale this study provides a more fundamental and practical way to explore corrosion and scaling process of metal pipeline 2 materials and methods 2 1 galvanic cell reactor a galvanic cell reactor was designed and set up in this study to simulate electrochemical reactions between iron oxides in pipe scale and metallic iron on pipe walls the scheme of galvanic cell reactor is illustrated in fig 1 the results are shown in section 3 2 reaction vessel was made of plexiglass to benefit observation and to prevent interference of other metallic materials inside the vessel a homogeneous anion exchange membrane hangzhou grion environmental technology hangzhou china was used to separate the reaction vessel into an anode chamber and a cathode chamber each with a volume of 20 0 ml an adam 6217 electric signal acquisition module advantech taipei china was connected to collect the data low do water shown in table 1 was supplied to act as the electrolyte the anode was a carefully polished cast iron plate 1 0 cm2 0 2 cm to represent pipe wall cleaned real pipe scale shell was ground into fine powder until it could pass through a 300 mesh sieve powder of ground pipe scale as well as analytically pure magnetite powder goethite powder lepidocrocite powder was mixed with graphite powder and then individually pressed by a tablet presser to make round sheets as cathode 1 0 cm2 0 2 cm then a galvanic cell reactor with various replaceable electrodes was built the reactor was kept well sealed and put into a lab2000 glove box etelux beijing china during a batch of experiments to prevent oxygen entering which can simulate anoxic condition caused by long term stagnation in dwds electromotive force and current of the cell reactor were monitored continuously during the 3 days experiments then water quality of the effluent was determined by this means galvanic reactions occurring in complex micro niche of pipe scale can be investigated more easily and in a more controlled way 2 2 three electrode setup cathodic reduction of iron oxide scale was investigated using a three electrode setup scheme is shown in fig s1 results are shown in section 3 3 analytically pure magnetite powder goethite powder or lepidocrocite powder 0 10 g was mixed with graphite powder 0 10 g in 5 0 ml of absolute ethanol and then 50 μl of nafion solution dupont wilmington de usa were added to allow the mixture to be coated on platinum sheet graphite increased conductivity between iron oxide and platinum substrate nafion solution acted as a conductive organic binder and ethanol was used to dilute and disperse the mixture surface of the platinum electrode was coated uniformly and completely with the suspension and then allowed to dry naturally this platinum sheet coated with iron oxide powder was used as the working electrode we a pure platinum sheet was used as the counter electrode ce and an ag agcl kcl saturated electrode was used as the reference electrode re thus formed a three electrode setup low do water shown in table 1 was supplied to act as the electrolyte cathodic polarization tests and cyclic voltammetry tests were performed by an electrochemical workstation corrtest instruments corp wuhan china the setup was kept tightly sealed during electrochemical tests besides a rusted cast iron electrode was also prepared by putting a newly polished cast iron sheet into flowing tap water for 6 months to allow it being corroded and scaled naturally then the corroded and scaled iron sheet was used as the working electrode in the above three electrode setup for electrochemical tests results are shown in section 3 4 2 3 feed water used as the electrolyte under anoxic conditions was the reduction of iron oxide scale investigated tap water with a low do concentration and a low orp was used as the electrolyte in this study tap water from tsinghua university produced from groundwater was boiled sealed by film and cooled to remove do then nitrogen gas was bubbled through for 30 min to blow off residual do before electrochemical tests tap water without the abovementioned treatment was used in tests for comparative purposes basic water quality items including ph do concentration conductivity and orp were measured by a hq 40d water quality analyzer hach shanghai china concentrations of anions were determined using a thermo dionex ics 5000 ion chromatographer thermo fisher scientific waltham ma usa alkalinity and hardness were determined by performing titrimetric analyses concentrations of total iron in the effluent water samples were determined by spectrophotometry the basic water quality of water is shown in table 1 2 4 experiments with real pipe section pipe sections used in this study were taken from a dn100 cast iron pipe that had been used for over 15 years in beijing shown in fig s2 scale tubercula upon the pipe section could be observed to distribute uniformly scale tubercula was gently knocked off from pipe wall then loose corrosion products on the interior surface of tubercula were scraped off to leave the hard shell crystal composition of the hard shell of pipe scale was analyzed by x ray diffractometry xrd a 10 cm long pipe section with just one flange fitted on the bottom was filled with tap water with a do concentration more than 7 0 mg l to create an open aerobic situation another pipe section with a pair of flanges fitted on both sides was filled with tap water with a do concentration less than 1 0 mg l to create a sealed anoxic situation two pipe sections with holding water were put into an incubator under stagnation status at 22 2 c some pieces of scale from the two pipe sections were collected after 3 and 6 months and then subjected to scanning electron microscopy sem 2 5 electrochemical analysis cathodic polarization tests were performed in the range of 0 80 to 0 20 v at a scanning rate of 1 0 mv s cyclic voltammetry tests were performed in the range of 1 50 to 1 50 v at a scanning rate of 1 0 mv s for 5 cycles potentiodynamic polarization tests were performed in the range of 0 50 to 0 50 v at a scanning rate of 10 mv s electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was performed in the frequency range of 100 khz to 10 mhz with a signal amplitude of 10 mv test data were analyzed using zsimpwin software corrtest instruments corp wuhan china 2 6 scale characterization methods crystalline phases of pipe scale and iron oxide powder were characterized using an x ray diffractometer rigaku tokyo japan diffraction angles were between 10 and 90 with a 0 1 step crystal compositions were identified using mdi jade software reachsoft beijing china with standard pdf cards 2004 pipe scale was gently scraped off the pipe wall and freeze dried for 24 h in an fdu 1100 system rikakikai tokyo japan scanning electron microscopy was performed using a jsm 7001f field emission scanning electron microscope jeol tokyo japan to assess morphological characteristics of inner and outer surfaces of the scale 3 results and discussion 3 1 composition and morphology of pipe scale 3 1 1 crystal phase composition of pipe scale several pieces of scale upon iron pipe wall were knocked off made into sheet electrodes and assembled in the galvanic cell reactor for 30 and 60 days continuous experiment then composition of raw scale and electrodes after experiments were identified by x ray diffractometry the results are shown in fig s3 and table 2 the raw scale upon iron pipe wall was mainly composed of magnetite fe3o4 goethite α feooh and lepidocrocite γ feooh a small amount of hematite α fe2o3 was also detected composition and structure of the raw pipe scale were relatively stable and similar to those reported in previous studies sarin et al 2004a yang et al 2012 mi et al 2015 shams et al 2019 scale composition had changed largely after 30 day or 60 day electrochemical reactions occurred in the galvanic cell reactor proportion of fe3o4 in raw scale was 32 1 before the experiments increased to 36 1 after 30 days of experiments and eventually reached 37 6 after 60 days of experiments proportion of α feooh in raw scale was 49 5 before the experiments decreased to 47 1 after 30 days of experiments and reached 44 0 after 60 days of experiments proportion of γ feooh increased slightly and proportion of fe2o3 changed little during the experiments a parallel experiment with one piece of scale taken from another cast iron pipe section showed a similar change of composition of both scale samples change in scale composition indicated that cathodic reduction in the galvanic cell under anoxic conditions transformed α feooh into fe3o4 this transformation process was electrochemically driven unlike microbe driven processes previously described zhang et al 2014a yang et al 2012 the quick transformation might induce changes of layered structure of pipe scale in 30 60 days which is much faster than natural scale growth processes in iron pipelines lasting for years and would make pipe scale more unstable or more fragile 3 1 2 micromorphology of the scale samples from pipe sections pipe sections were placed in an open aerobic situation and a sealed anoxic situation for months as described in section 2 4 collected scale samples were then subjected to scanning electron microscopy and the results are shown in fig 2 the outer surface of pipe scale formed under aerobic conditions looks smooth and compact as shown in fig 2 a while the inner layer was rough but very dense as shown in fig 2 b dense compact structure of the scale would protect pipe wall from further corrosion in contrast the outer surface of pipe scale formed under anoxic conditions presented many holes and cracks as shown in fig 2 c and 2 e and the inner layer contained large holes with diameters of 20 μm as shown in fig 2 d hydraulic conditions were similar in two systems so their different morphological characteristics would have been caused by chemical reactions needle like goethite and small spherical magnetite were dominant in the inner layer of pipe scale formed under aerobic conditions as shown in fig 2 f triangular prismatic iron compounds which might be mixtures of ferrous and ferric compounds were found in the inner layer of scale formed under anoxic conditions as shown in fig 2 h morphology of the scale samples after 3 month and 6 month experiments were compared there were more and larger cracks upon the outer surface of scale under anoxic condition as shown in fig 2 e and 2 g cracks on the outside of the scale might be caused by ruptures in hard shell layer in layered pipe scale a porous core was composed of various iron corrosion products including feco3 fe oh 2 fe oh 3 feooh and green rust continuous corrosion and accumulation of corrosion products will usually expand the volume and cause higher pressure inside scale therefore pressure difference between the internal and external scale may exceed the tolerance of scale shell and then bring rupture especially when hard shell layer becomes thinner and weaker due to electrochemical reduction reactions 3 2 electrochemical reactions in galvanic cell reactor 3 2 1 electromotive forces of electrochemical reactions electromotive force i e the difference in potential between the cathode and anode in the galvanic cell reactor was measured as shown in fig 3 electrode potential for an electrochemical reaction can be calculated using the nernst equation shown in eq 5 theoretical electromotive forces of galvanic cell reactions were therefore calculated as shown in eq 6 5 φ φ θ r t n f l n o x i x i re d j y j where constant r equals to 8 314 j mol k t k is the absolute temperature n is the number of transferred electrons in a reaction and f is the faraday constant 96 485 c mol oxi represents concentration of each oxidized substance and redj represents concentration of each reduced substance 6 e 0 φ a n o d e φ c a t h o d e the nernst equation for each reaction tested in this study is concluded in table 3 electromotive forces for oxidation of fe0 under aerobic conditions were measured as 1 10 1 20 v with our reactor which were quite close to the theoretical value of 1 29 v under anoxic conditions potential differences between fe0 anode and magnetite cathode were 0 37 0 78 v which were also close to the theoretical value the case of using zinc anode was conducted to further verify the occurrence of electrochemical reaction in galvanic cell reactors which also presented quite close results to theoretical value potential differences between fe0 anode and α feooh cathode were measured as 0 34 0 67 v and that between fe0 anode and γ feooh cathode were measured as 0 44 0 75 v for comparison potential differences between fe0 anode and inert platinum cathode was much lower at only 0 25 v meanwhile potential differences between fe0 anode and pipe scale cathode were measured as 0 43 0 68 v the pipe scale cathode had a lower potential than pure iron oxide cathode because some impurities in scale decreased reactivity of electrode measured electromotive force in the galvanic cell reactor reflected the difference between various anode and cathode materials that were used indicating the driving force of electrochemical reaction the results acquired using experimental design and cathode preparation method matched theoretically expected results fairly well more importantly electromotive forces between various electrode couples matched expected values calculated using the nernst equation in the ph range of 6 50 8 40 these results proved directly that kuch s mechanism for iron release from scale in dwds was valid from the reaction perspective with the absence of oxygen or other oxidants iron oxide in pipe scale will act as an electron acceptor during electrochemical corrosion resulting in reduction of ferric oxides 3 2 2 electric current and water chemistry change electric current during galvanic cell reactions was monitored using an external test module current decreased rapidly in first several hours and became relatively stable after 2 6 h the stable current for galvanic cell reaction was measured as 100 μa when the cathode was α feooh 40 μa when the cathode was γ feooh 75 μa when the cathode was fe3o4 and 30 μa when the cathode was made from pipe scale large current during the initial stage of galvanic cell reaction may be explained by electrodes being smoothly polished ferrous compounds would have been attached to metal surface as reaction processed decreasing the direct contact surface of electrodes with water and then restrain electron transfer efficiency anodic reaction in the galvanic cell clearly involved electron losing from fe0 but cathodic reactions may involve reduction of iron oxides and water molecule simultaneously current measured during experiments would therefore be attributed to both electrochemical processes thermodynamically reaction would be inclined toward electrons being gained by iron oxides because this process has a much higher potential however from the kinetics perspective electrochemical reactions are more likely to involve water molecules in liquid phase than ferric ions in solid phase notably electromotive force represents the tendency of electrochemical reaction which is a thermodynamic concept while electric current represents the speed of electrochemical reaction which is a kinetics concept the results of a closed circuit and an open circuit in the galvanic cell were compared measured total iron concentrations of effluents in the cathode chamber were 300 1200 μg l when circuit was closed for 72 h while that were only 10 50 μg l i e dozens of times lower when circuit was open this difference indicated that reduction reaction occurred at the cathode and ferrous compounds formed by comparing the measured current and the total iron concentration in the effluent it can be found that the reduction of water or hydrogen evolution is the main electrochemical reaction in galvanic cell this is mainly due to the difference in reaction rates based on electron balance the prediction of total iron would be about 800 times of the detected iron in cathode chamber which means that reduction of ferric oxide only contributes about 0 13 of total current considering the electromotive force of pipe scale cathode versus metallic iron about 0 5 v at neutral ph and the large resistance of pipe scale cathode about 1 2 mω the current caused by reduction of ferric oxides in pipe scale would be roughly calculated in 0 4 μa cm2 close to the level of aforementioned calculation ph of effluents from both the anode and cathode chambers changed greatly after galvanic reaction as shown in fig 4 in a closed circuit ph in the anode chamber decreased but ph in the cathode chamber increased no matter what initial ph was due to electrochemical reactions hydrolysis of fe2 upon the anode would decrease ph and oh produced at the cathode would increase ph however changes of ph in both the anode and cathode chambers were not obvious when circuit was open indicating that no electrochemical reactions occurred in cathode chambers changes of effluent ph was larger when the initial solution ph was lower iron oxide cathode is more readily reduced as acidity increased meaning the electromotive force of reaction increases as ph decreases according to the nernst equations shown in table 3 the results described above indicated that reduction of iron oxides did occur at the cathode in closed circuit and consequently fe2 and oh were produced in the cathode side of galvanic cell the results also proved directly that kuch s mechanism was valid since the proposed electrochemical reactions can be evidenced by detected current and by changes in water chemistry 3 3 electrochemical characteristics of iron oxide electrodes 3 3 1 cathodic potentiodynamic polarization tests platinum sheet coated with various iron oxides powder were used as the working electrodes electrochemical characteristics of iron oxide were studied using a cathodic potentiodynamic polarization method in the three electrode setup a graphite coated electrode was used in a control test the results are shown in fig 5 for each electrode when applied potential reached a certain value 0 5 v the detected current hardly changed with the increase of applied potential this indicated that the electrode itself was involved in an electrochemical reaction and the rate of reaction was controlled by diffusion which means the reaction had a limit current density limit current density for fe3o4 and α feooh electrodes were 20 μa cm2 indicating that abilities of these materials to be reduced were relatively strong whereas limit current density for γ feooh and pipe scale electrodes were 15 μa cm2 indicating that abilities of these materials to be reduced were relatively weak it is widely believed that in typical pipe scale γ feooh was formed in the initial stage and gradually transformed into fe3o4 and α feooh oh et al 1998 kim 2017 song et al 2017 this is reflected in that fe3o4 and α feooh have denser crystal structure and are therefore better electrical conductors than γ feooh the results indicated that under anoxic conditions iron oxide with a more regular structure conducive to electron transfer were reduced more rapidly causing pipe scale to become less compact 3 3 2 cyclic voltammetry tests linear cyclic voltammetry tests were performed to investigate reaction characteristics of coated electrodes in the three electrode setup obtained voltammograms are shown in fig 6 voltammogram of graphite coated electrode fig 6 a contained a clear reduction peak at 0 472 v corresponding to reduction of water h2o into hydrogen molecule h2 and a small oxidation peak at 0 421 v corresponding to oxidation of water h2o into oxygen molecule o2 song et al 1996 voltammogram for fe3o4 coated electrode fig 6 b contained two reduction peaks the reduction peak at 0 496 v was close to the peak in graphite electrode voltammogram and corresponded to reduction of water the peak at 0 741 v corresponded to reduction of fe3o4 to ferrous ions there was also an oxidation peak at 0 020 v much lower potential than the peak for oxidation of water which was assigned to oxidation of fe3o4 into ferric oxides bülter et al 2016 dong et al 2016 voltammogram for γ feooh coated electrode fig 6 c contained a reduction peak at 0 442 v corresponding to reduction of water and a very weak reduction peak at 0 760 v indicating that the reduction reaction involving γ feooh was less readily than fe3o4 the oxidation peak at 0 334 v was also small and may correspond to oxidation of small amounts of ferrous ions to ferric compounds no oxidation peak was present in the voltammogram for α feooh coated electrode fig 7 d but there were two reduction peaks one at 0 439 v corresponding to reduction of water and another at 0 702 v corresponding to reduction of α feooh zhang et al 2014a fracchia et al 2018 the results proved that reduction reactions between iron oxides and metallic iron occurred abilities of different iron oxides to be reduced could be judged by positions of reduction peaks in voltammetry curves the reduction peak was at a more negative potential for γ feooh 0 760 v than the other iron oxides indicating that γ feooh was more readily reduced however smaller current 0 3 ma cm2 at this reduction peak indicated that the reduction rate was much lower less negative peak potentials for α feooh electrode 0 702 v indicated that α feooh was least likely to be reduced however currents at the reduction peaks of fe3o4 and α feooh were 0 5 and 0 4 ma cm2 respectively indicating that the reduction rate was highest for fe3o4 which was consistent with high conductivity of fe3o4 abovementioned electrochemical assays allowed reduction characteristics of different iron oxides and pipe scale to be determined the results also revealed mechanisms involved in transformation of iron oxide scale in an anoxic environment which further verified that kuch s mechanism is valid in iron release in dwds 3 4 electrochemical characteristics of rusted iron electrodes 3 4 1 potentiodynamic polarization tests scale on rusted iron generally has a resistance to further corrosion and presents protection to inner iron substrate however this protection may be weakened under anoxic condition rusted iron electrodes were used as the working electrodes in the three electrode setup and current density responses at different potential polarizations were recorded as shown in fig s5 when no current pass through electrode potential of rusted iron electrode which is call the self corrosion potential changed from 0 586 v to 0 637 v after the electrode had been immersed in anoxic water for 2 weeks the negative shift of potential indicated an increase in corrosion tendency which might be caused by change of scale layer structure on electrode surface under anoxic conditions the structural change decreased the resistance to ion diffusion during electrochemical reactions corrosion current density for rusted iron electrode which was calculated using the tafel method increased from 13 3 μa cm2 to 16 2 μa cm2 after the electrode had been immersed in anoxic water for 2 weeks increase of current density implied the acceleration of corrosion rate indicating that protection provided by scale layer on the rusted iron electrode surface was weakened considering the previous scanning electron microscopy results these changes might be caused by more pores and cracks appearing on scale layer surface 3 4 2 electrochemical impedance spectroscopy impedance spectroscopy was performed to investigate characteristics of the rusted iron electrodes as well the results were used to plot nyquist diagrams shown in fig s6 the nyquist diagram contains a semicircle and an oblique line in high frequency part the capacitive reactance arc of electric double layer represents a kinetic control process and in low frequency part diffusion control exceeds electrochemical control resulting in warburg impedance titz et al 1992 by fitting in the zsimpwin software equivalent circuit can be constructed from impedance spectrum results shown in fig s7 thus solution resistance rs charge transfer resistance rct during a redox reaction capacitance of electric double layer cdl and warburg impedance wr wt wp representing diffusion of charge migrating to counter electrode can be estimated as shown in table s1 notably the charge transfer resistance rct of rusted iron electrode decreased by 24 after the electrode had been immersed in anoxic water for 2 weeks more cracks and pores formed on pipe scale surface and this would have increased the surface area available for charge transfer as fe3o4 is more conductive than other iron oxides an increase in proportion of fe3o4 in pipe scale will also make charge transfer occur more readily moreover the capacitance of electric double layer cdl of rusted iron electrode increased by 46 which might be caused by scale layer becoming thinner nigam et al 2006 guo et al 2020 the results reflected the transformations in pipe scale structure under anoxic conditions weakening the protection of pipe wall offered by scale layer this loss of protection increased corrosion tendency and corrosion rate 4 conclusions reactions of iron oxide scale leading to iron release in dwdss were studied by new approaches which simplify complex iron pipe scale into electrodes made of iron oxides and metallic iron the experiment results presented direct evidence for kuch s mechanism that reduction of iron oxide in pipe scale occurs under anoxic conditions main conclusions are shown below 1 micro morphology of pipe scale changed obviously when pipe section was immersed in anoxic water for months the outer surface of scale roughened and more cracks and pores appeared change of components of pipe scale under anoxic condition i e a decrease in the proportion of α feooh and an increase in the proportion of fe3o4 indicated the transformation of α feooh into fe3o4 2 by the galvanic cell reactor electromotive force between different iron oxides and metallic iron fe0 were measured which matched the values calculated using the nernst equation well detected current and changes in water chemistry also indicated that electrochemical reactions between iron oxides and metallic iron occurred 3 electrochemical tests using prepared iron oxide electrodes in the three electrodes setup present more details of reduction characteristics of iron oxides lepidocrocite γ feooh is most likely to be reduced but at a low rate magnetite fe3o4 also has a strong tendency to be reduced goethite α feooh has the weakest reduction ability but its reduction rate is rapid as goethite was found to be preferentially reduced in pipe scale it can be inferred that kinetics plays a leading role in reduction of iron oxide scales 4 electrochemical tests using rusted iron electrodes indicated that the protection of pipe wall by scale layer was weakened under anoxic condition

iron compounds are hot topics in the field of water supply the aim of this study is to determine whether and how ferric components in pipe scale be reduced under anoxic condition in this study new investigation approaches were applied which include simplifying the complex scale into electrode pairs developing novel simulating reactors and conducting tailored electrochemical assays a galvanic cell reactor with anode of metallic iron fe0 and various cathode made of certain iron oxide feox was firstly developed to simulate the complex niche and components of pipe scale electrochemical

match the nernst equation quite well as main components in pipe scale lepidocrocite γ feooh was found to be the most reducible iron oxide but at low rate while goethite α feooh has weak reducibility but can be quickly reduced as a result of electrochemical reactions goethite in pipe scale was transformed into magnetite fe3o4 by these means electrochemical reaction mechanisms of pipe scale disruption were revealed which is helpful to restrain pipe corrosion and water deterioration in dwds graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords pipe scale iron oxide electrochemical reaction kuch mechanism nernst equation drinking water data availability we have shared the data in the supplementary information file 1 introduction adequate and qualified drinking water supply is essential to modern lives drinking water distribution system dwds is a key part of water supply system which suffers water quality deterioration problems due to the biological and chemical stability issues in urban and rural area sarin et al 2001 bei et al 2019 iron pipelines are used widely in dwds around the world because of its high strength moderate cost and good durability iron pipelines have contributed 68 2 of dwds pipelines in the usa and 69 7 in china usepa 2007 cuwa 2017 corrosion and scaling inevitably occur in iron pipelines over the long term oxidation of metallic iron fe0 on pipe surfaces forms iron oxide scale matured pipe scale has a layered structure with in order from the pipe surface a corroded floor a porous core a dense shell like layer and a surface layer of sediments sarin et al 2004a the shell like layer is mainly consisted of magnetite fe3o4 goethite α feooh and smaller proportion of lepidocrocite γ feooh which has a compact and dense structure that inhibits corrosion at pipe surface the porous core contains large amounts of ferrous and ferric compounds and presents a loose and porous structure sarin et al 2001 yang et al 2012 zhang et al 2020 the layered structure of iron scale can be changed when water in pipeline changes from flowing to stagnant and dissolved oxygen do and chlorine depleted ferric oxides in pipe scale can be reduced into ferrous compounds which are more soluble nawrocki et al 2010 liu et al 2017 zlatanović et al 2017 lytle et al 2020 reduction of iron oxides causes protective shell layer to become thinner stable structure to break down and pipe corrosion to accelerate sarin et al 2004b li et al 2012 zhang et al 2014a previous studies of iron release in dwds have been focused on water quality deterioration factors affecting iron release and measures to control iron release vreeburg et al 2007 benson et al 2012 zhang et al 2014b some researchers investigated various influence factors on iron release including oxidants and corrosive ions in an experiment using pipe section reactors made of a 20 year old cast iron pipe iron concentration increased by 0 15 mg l when do concentration in water decreased from 8 0 to 4 9 mg l sun et al 2014 in contrast iron concentration decreased only by 0 07 mg l when do concentration increased from 8 0 to 15 0 mg l hu et al 2018 do concentration of 8 11 mg l in the pipe section reactor controlled iron release effectively sun et al 2014 concentration of released iron also increased markedly when disinfectant concentration in water decreased mi et al 2016 iron release will accelerate if concentrations of corrosive anions e g chloride and sulfate increase and oxidation reduction potential orp is less than 300 mv however iron release will be restrained if orp is higher than 400 mv even if the concentrations of corrosive anions increase mi et al 2015 it is generally believed that the released ferrous and ferric compounds are produced through corrosion or through dissolution of iron oxide products imran et al 2005 liu et al 2013 it is the reduction of iron oxide scale that is key to the iron release because it causes changes in composition and structure of pipe scale at the microscopic level and makes pipe scale to be less stable at the macroscopic level trueman et al 2017 mechanism involved in reduction of iron iii oxides scale under low do concentrations was first proposed by kuch 1988 he found a negative correlation between the rest potential of lepidocrocite and do concentration and then performed theoretical calculations to identify the relationship between current and content of lepidocrocite other researchers also believed that iron release would occur due to chemical and electrochemical reactions in pipe scale under reducing conditions lair et al 2006 vreeburg et al 2007 trueman et al 2017 with the absence of oxygen or chlorine ferric oxides in the shell like layer of scale become the cathode in electrochemical reactions and are reduced to slightly soluble ferrous hydroxide ishikawa et al 2002 magnetite the product of reduction of lepidocrocite can be further reduced to ferrous hydroxide kuch 1988 liu et al 2001 sugae et al 2019 as shown in eqs 1 4 these reactions lead to change and even fracture of pipe scale structure which further cause pipe scale to dissolve become thinner and crack 1 anode f e 2 e f

iron oxide in pipe scale have not been directly verified in experiments first kuch 1988 reported the dynamic of rest potential and current of lepidocrocite in tap water but did not test the potential and current of real galvanic couple i e ferric oxides and metallic iron in scale directly second few previous investigations explored the behavior of pipe scale during electrochemical reactions deeply since the layered structure and amorphous composition of scale are quite complex and difficult to simulate evolution of pipe scale is generally detected indirectly through variation of water chemistry in pipelines therefore the aforementioned processes involved in electrochemical reduction should be simulated more accurately using more ingenious experimental designs and reactors than previous ones more practical and accurate methods are required to investigate pipe scale in dwds electrochemical assays have been widely used to study metal corrosion and scaling processes miyata et al 2002 guo et al 2016 zhang et al 2020 potentiodynamic polarization tests have been used to explore corrosion tendencies and rates frateur et al 1999 impedance spectroscopy can be used to assess the effect of scale layer on iron corrosion barcia et al 2002 cyclic voltammetry can be used to study redox reactions at the electrodes nickchi et al 2019 electrochemical assays have the advantages of in situ real time and high accuracy evolution of pipe scale can be comprehensively investigated using various electrochemical and characterization methods in this study mechanisms involved in electrochemical reduction of iron oxide scale was investigated by new approaches which include simplifying complex pipe scale into electrode pairs made of pure iron oxides developing innovative simulating reactors and conducting tailored electrochemical assays a galvanic cell reactor was set up to simulate operation conditions of pipeline in dwds it can provide direct and precise evidences to confirm the kuch s mechanism of iron oxide scale reduction electrochemical and characterization methods were used to allow the reduction characteristics of various iron oxides in pipe scale to be comprehensively compared the objectives of this study include 1 to simulate reduction reactions of iron oxides under anoxic condition occurring in complex micro niche of pipe scale 2 to investigate processes involved in reduction of scale using various electrochemical assays and tests and 3 to evidence the kuch s mechanism by direct galvanic experiment results as far as the authors know this is the first study in the field of water treatment setting up galvanic cell reactors and applying real pipe scale as the cathode to investigate electrochemical processes upon pipe scale this study provides a more fundamental and practical way to explore corrosion and scaling process of metal pipeline 2 materials and methods 2 1 galvanic cell reactor a galvanic cell reactor was designed and set up in this study to simulate electrochemical reactions between iron oxides in pipe scale and metallic iron on pipe walls the scheme of galvanic cell reactor is illustrated in fig 1 the results are shown in section 3 2 reaction vessel was made of plexiglass to benefit observation and to prevent interference of other metallic materials inside the vessel a homogeneous anion exchange membrane hangzhou grion environmental technology hangzhou china was used to separate the reaction vessel into an anode chamber and a cathode chamber each with a volume of 20 0 ml an adam 6217 electric signal acquisition module advantech taipei china was connected to collect the data low do water shown in table 1 was supplied to act as the electrolyte the anode was a carefully polished cast iron plate 1 0 cm2 0 2 cm to represent pipe wall cleaned real pipe scale shell was ground into fine powder until it could pass through a 300 mesh sieve powder of ground pipe scale as well as analytically pure magnetite powder goethite powder lepidocrocite powder was mixed with graphite powder and then individually pressed by a tablet presser to make round sheets as cathode 1 0 cm2 0 2 cm then a galvanic cell reactor with various replaceable electrodes was built the reactor was kept well sealed and put into a lab2000 glove box etelux beijing china during a batch of experiments to prevent oxygen entering which can simulate anoxic condition caused by long term stagnation in dwds electromotive force and current of the cell reactor were monitored continuously during the 3 days experiments then water quality of the effluent was determined by this means galvanic reactions occurring in complex micro niche of pipe scale can be investigated more easily and in a more controlled way 2 2 three electrode setup cathodic reduction of iron oxide scale was investigated using a three electrode setup scheme is shown in fig s1 results are shown in section 3 3 analytically pure magnetite powder goethite powder or lepidocrocite powder 0 10 g was mixed with graphite powder 0 10 g in 5 0 ml of absolute ethanol and then 50 μl of nafion solution dupont wilmington de usa were added to allow the mixture to be coated on platinum sheet graphite increased conductivity between iron oxide and platinum substrate nafion solution acted as a conductive organic binder and ethanol was used to dilute and disperse the mixture surface of the platinum electrode was coated uniformly and completely with the suspension and then allowed to dry naturally this platinum sheet coated with iron oxide powder was used as the working electrode we a pure platinum sheet was used as the counter electrode ce and an ag agcl kcl saturated electrode was used as the reference electrode re thus formed a three electrode setup low do water shown in table 1 was supplied to act as the electrolyte cathodic polarization tests and cyclic voltammetry tests were performed by an electrochemical workstation corrtest instruments corp wuhan china the setup was kept tightly sealed during electrochemical tests besides a rusted cast iron electrode was also prepared by putting a newly polished cast iron sheet into flowing tap water for 6 months to allow it being corroded and scaled naturally then the corroded and scaled iron sheet was used as the working electrode in the above three electrode setup for electrochemical tests results are shown in section 3 4 2 3 feed water used as the electrolyte under anoxic conditions was the reduction of iron oxide scale investigated tap water with a low do concentration and a low orp was used as the electrolyte in this study tap water from tsinghua university produced from groundwater was boiled sealed by film and cooled to remove do then nitrogen gas was bubbled through for 30 min to blow off residual do before electrochemical tests tap water without the abovementioned treatment was used in tests for comparative purposes basic water quality items including ph do concentration conductivity and orp were measured by a hq 40d water quality analyzer hach shanghai china concentrations of anions were determined using a thermo dionex ics 5000 ion chromatographer thermo fisher scientific waltham ma usa alkalinity and hardness were determined by performing titrimetric analyses concentrations of total iron in the effluent water samples were determined by spectrophotometry the basic water quality of water is shown in table 1 2 4 experiments with real pipe section pipe sections used in this study were taken from a dn100 cast iron pipe that had been used for over 15 years in beijing shown in fig s2 scale tubercula upon the pipe section could be observed to distribute uniformly scale tubercula was gently knocked off from pipe wall then loose corrosion products on the interior surface of tubercula were scraped off to leave the hard shell crystal composition of the hard shell of pipe scale was analyzed by x ray diffractometry xrd a 10 cm long pipe section with just one flange fitted on the bottom was filled with tap water with a do concentration more than 7 0 mg l to create an open aerobic situation another pipe section with a pair of flanges fitted on both sides was filled with tap water with a do concentration less than 1 0 mg l to create a sealed anoxic situation two pipe sections with holding water were put into an incubator under stagnation status at 22 2 c some pieces of scale from the two pipe sections were collected after 3 and 6 months and then subjected to scanning electron microscopy sem 2 5 electrochemical analysis cathodic polarization tests were performed in the range of 0 80 to 0 20 v at a scanning rate of 1 0 mv s cyclic voltammetry tests were performed in the range of 1 50 to 1 50 v at a scanning rate of 1 0 mv s for 5 cycles potentiodynamic polarization tests were performed in the range of 0 50 to 0 50 v at a scanning rate of 10 mv s electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was performed in the frequency range of 100 khz to 10 mhz with a signal amplitude of 10 mv test data were analyzed using zsimpwin software corrtest instruments corp wuhan china 2 6 scale characterization methods crystalline phases of pipe scale and iron oxide powder were characterized using an x ray diffractometer rigaku tokyo japan diffraction angles were between 10 and 90 with a 0 1 step crystal compositions were identified using mdi jade software reachsoft beijing china with standard pdf cards 2004 pipe scale was gently scraped off the pipe wall and freeze dried for 24 h in an fdu 1100 system rikakikai tokyo japan scanning electron microscopy was performed using a jsm 7001f field emission scanning electron microscope jeol tokyo japan to assess morphological characteristics of inner and outer surfaces of the scale 3 results and discussion 3 1 composition and morphology of pipe scale 3 1 1 crystal phase composition of pipe scale several pieces of scale upon iron pipe wall were knocked off made into sheet electrodes and assembled in the galvanic cell reactor for 30 and 60 days continuous experiment then composition of raw scale and electrodes after experiments were identified by x ray diffractometry the results are shown in fig s3 and table 2 the raw scale upon iron pipe wall was mainly composed of magnetite fe3o4 goethite α feooh and lepidocrocite γ feooh a small amount of hematite α fe2o3 was also detected composition and structure of the raw pipe scale were relatively stable and similar to those reported in previous studies sarin et al 2004a yang et al 2012 mi et al 2015 shams et al 2019 scale composition had changed largely after 30 day or 60 day electrochemical reactions occurred in the galvanic cell reactor proportion of fe3o4 in raw scale was 32 1 before the experiments increased to 36 1 after 30 days of experiments and eventually reached 37 6 after 60 days of experiments proportion of α feooh in raw scale was 49 5 before the experiments decreased to 47 1 after 30 days of experiments and reached 44 0 after 60 days of experiments proportion of γ feooh increased slightly and proportion of fe2o3 changed little during the experiments a parallel experiment with one piece of scale taken from another cast iron pipe section showed a similar change of composition of both scale samples change in scale composition indicated that cathodic reduction in the galvanic cell under anoxic conditions transformed α feooh into fe3o4 this transformation process was electrochemically driven unlike microbe driven processes previously described zhang et al 2014a yang et al 2012 the quick transformation might induce changes of layered structure of pipe scale in 30 60 days which is much faster than natural scale growth processes in iron pipelines lasting for years and would make pipe scale more unstable or more fragile 3 1 2 micromorphology of the scale samples from pipe sections pipe sections were placed in an open aerobic situation and a sealed anoxic situation for months as described in section 2 4 collected scale samples were then subjected to scanning electron microscopy and the results are shown in fig 2 the outer surface of pipe scale formed under aerobic conditions looks smooth and compact as shown in fig 2 a while the inner layer was rough but very dense as shown in fig 2 b dense compact structure of the scale would protect pipe wall from further corrosion in contrast the outer surface of pipe scale formed under anoxic conditions presented many holes and cracks as shown in fig 2 c and 2 e and the inner layer contained large holes with diameters of 20 μm as shown in fig 2 d hydraulic conditions were similar in two systems so their different morphological characteristics would have been caused by chemical reactions needle like goethite and small spherical magnetite were dominant in the inner layer of pipe scale formed under aerobic conditions as shown in fig 2 f triangular prismatic iron compounds which might be mixtures of ferrous and ferric compounds were found in the inner layer of scale formed under anoxic conditions as shown in fig 2 h morphology of the scale samples after 3 month and 6 month experiments were compared there were more and larger cracks upon the outer surface of scale under anoxic condition as shown in fig 2 e and 2 g cracks on the outside of the scale might be caused by ruptures in hard shell layer in layered pipe scale a porous core was composed of various iron corrosion products including feco3 fe oh 2 fe oh 3 feooh and green rust continuous corrosion and accumulation of corrosion products will usually expand the volume and cause higher pressure inside scale therefore pressure difference between the internal and external scale may exceed the tolerance of scale shell and then bring rupture especially when hard shell layer becomes thinner and weaker due to electrochemical reduction reactions 3 2 electrochemical reactions in galvanic cell reactor 3 2 1 electromotive forces of electrochemical reactions electromotive force i e the difference in potential between the cathode and anode in the galvanic cell reactor was measured as shown in fig 3 electrode potential for an electrochemical reaction can be calculated using the nernst equation shown in eq 5 theoretical electromotive forces of galvanic cell reactions were therefore calculated as shown in eq 6 5 φ φ θ r t n f l n o x i x i re d j y j where constant r equals to 8 314 j mol k t k is the absolute temperature n is the number of transferred electrons in a reaction and f is the faraday constant 96 485 c mol oxi represents concentration of each oxidized substance and redj represents concentration of each reduced substance 6 e 0 φ a n o d e φ c a t h o d e the nernst equation for each reaction tested in this study is concluded in table 3 electromotive forces for oxidation of fe0 under aerobic conditions were measured as 1 10 1 20 v with our reactor which were quite close to the theoretical value of 1 29 v under anoxic conditions potential differences between fe0 anode and magnetite cathode were 0 37 0 78 v which were also close to the theoretical value the case of using zinc anode was conducted to further verify the occurrence of electrochemical reaction in galvanic cell reactors which also presented quite close results to theoretical value potential differences between fe0 anode and α feooh cathode were measured as 0 34 0 67 v and that between fe0 anode and γ feooh cathode were measured as 0 44 0 75 v for comparison potential differences between fe0 anode and inert platinum cathode was much lower at only 0 25 v meanwhile potential differences between fe0 anode and pipe scale cathode were measured as 0 43 0 68 v the pipe scale cathode had a lower potential than pure iron oxide cathode because some impurities in scale decreased reactivity of electrode measured electromotive force in the galvanic cell reactor reflected the difference between various anode and cathode materials that were used indicating the driving force of electrochemical reaction the results acquired using experimental design and cathode preparation method matched theoretically expected results fairly well more importantly electromotive forces between various electrode couples matched expected values calculated using the nernst equation in the ph range of 6 50 8 40 these results proved directly that kuch s mechanism for iron release from scale in dwds was valid from the reaction perspective with the absence of oxygen or other oxidants iron oxide in pipe scale will act as an electron acceptor during electrochemical corrosion resulting in reduction of ferric oxides 3 2 2 electric current and water chemistry change electric current during galvanic cell reactions was monitored using an external test module current decreased rapidly in first several hours and became relatively stable after 2 6 h the stable current for galvanic cell reaction was measured as 100 μa when the cathode was α feooh 40 μa when the cathode was γ feooh 75 μa when the cathode was fe3o4 and 30 μa when the cathode was made from pipe scale large current during the initial stage of galvanic cell reaction may be explained by electrodes being smoothly polished ferrous compounds would have been attached to metal surface as reaction processed decreasing the direct contact surface of electrodes with water and then restrain electron transfer efficiency anodic reaction in the galvanic cell clearly involved electron losing from fe0 but cathodic reactions may involve reduction of iron oxides and water molecule simultaneously current measured during experiments would therefore be attributed to both electrochemical processes thermodynamically reaction would be inclined toward electrons being gained by iron oxides because this process has a much higher potential however from the kinetics perspective electrochemical reactions are more likely to involve water molecules in liquid phase than ferric ions in solid phase notably electromotive force represents the tendency of electrochemical reaction which is a thermodynamic concept while electric current represents the speed of electrochemical reaction which is a kinetics concept the results of a closed circuit and an open circuit in the galvanic cell were compared measured total iron concentrations of effluents in the cathode chamber were 300 1200 μg l when circuit was closed for 72 h while that were only 10 50 μg l i e dozens of times lower when circuit was open this difference indicated that reduction reaction occurred at the cathode and ferrous compounds formed by comparing the measured current and the total iron concentration in the effluent it can be found that the reduction of water or hydrogen evolution is the main electrochemical reaction in galvanic cell this is mainly due to the difference in reaction rates based on electron balance the prediction of total iron would be about 800 times of the detected iron in cathode chamber which means that reduction of ferric oxide only contributes about 0 13 of total current considering the electromotive force of pipe scale cathode versus metallic iron about 0 5 v at neutral ph and the large resistance of pipe scale cathode about 1 2 mω the current caused by reduction of ferric oxides in pipe scale would be roughly calculated in 0 4 μa cm2 close to the level of aforementioned calculation ph of effluents from both the anode and cathode chambers changed greatly after galvanic reaction as shown in fig 4 in a closed circuit ph in the anode chamber decreased but ph in the cathode chamber increased no matter what initial ph was due to electrochemical reactions hydrolysis of fe2 upon the anode would decrease ph and oh produced at the cathode would increase ph however changes of ph in both the anode and cathode chambers were not obvious when circuit was open indicating that no electrochemical reactions occurred in cathode chambers changes of effluent ph was larger when the initial solution ph was lower iron oxide cathode is more readily reduced as acidity increased meaning the electromotive force of reaction increases as ph decreases according to the nernst equations shown in table 3 the results described above indicated that reduction of iron oxides did occur at the cathode in closed circuit and consequently fe2 and oh were produced in the cathode side of galvanic cell the results also proved directly that kuch s mechanism was valid since the proposed electrochemical reactions can be evidenced by detected current and by changes in water chemistry 3 3 electrochemical characteristics of iron oxide electrodes 3 3 1 cathodic potentiodynamic polarization tests platinum sheet coated with various iron oxides powder were used as the working electrodes electrochemical characteristics of iron oxide were studied using a cathodic potentiodynamic polarization method in the three electrode setup a graphite coated electrode was used in a control test the results are shown in fig 5 for each electrode when applied potential reached a certain value 0 5 v the detected current hardly changed with the increase of applied potential this indicated that the electrode itself was involved in an electrochemical reaction and the rate of reaction was controlled by diffusion which means the reaction had a limit current density limit current density for fe3o4 and α feooh electrodes were 20 μa cm2 indicating that abilities of these materials to be reduced were relatively strong whereas limit current density for γ feooh and pipe scale electrodes were 15 μa cm2 indicating that abilities of these materials to be reduced were relatively weak it is widely believed that in typical pipe scale γ feooh was formed in the initial stage and gradually transformed into fe3o4 and α feooh oh et al 1998 kim 2017 song et al 2017 this is reflected in that fe3o4 and α feooh have denser crystal structure and are therefore better electrical conductors than γ feooh the results indicated that under anoxic conditions iron oxide with a more regular structure conducive to electron transfer were reduced more rapidly causing pipe scale to become less compact 3 3 2 cyclic voltammetry tests linear cyclic voltammetry tests were performed to investigate reaction characteristics of coated electrodes in the three electrode setup obtained voltammograms are shown in fig 6 voltammogram of graphite coated electrode fig 6 a contained a clear reduction peak at 0 472 v corresponding to reduction of water h2o into hydrogen molecule h2 and a small oxidation peak at 0 421 v corresponding to oxidation of water h2o into oxygen molecule o2 song et al 1996 voltammogram for fe3o4 coated electrode fig 6 b contained two reduction peaks the reduction peak at 0 496 v was close to the peak in graphite electrode voltammogram and corresponded to reduction of water the peak at 0 741 v corresponded to reduction of fe3o4 to ferrous ions there was also an oxidation peak at 0 020 v much lower potential than the peak for oxidation of water which was assigned to oxidation of fe3o4 into ferric oxides bülter et al 2016 dong et al 2016 voltammogram for γ feooh coated electrode fig 6 c contained a reduction peak at 0 442 v corresponding to reduction of water and a very weak reduction peak at 0 760 v indicating that the reduction reaction involving γ feooh was less readily than fe3o4 the oxidation peak at 0 334 v was also small and may correspond to oxidation of small amounts of ferrous ions to ferric compounds no oxidation peak was present in the voltammogram for α feooh coated electrode fig 7 d but there were two reduction peaks one at 0 439 v corresponding to reduction of water and another at 0 702 v corresponding to reduction of α feooh zhang et al 2014a fracchia et al 2018 the results proved that reduction reactions between iron oxides and metallic iron occurred abilities of different iron oxides to be reduced could be judged by positions of reduction peaks in voltammetry curves the reduction peak was at a more negative potential for γ feooh 0 760 v than the other iron oxides indicating that γ feooh was more readily reduced however smaller current 0 3 ma cm2 at this reduction peak indicated that the reduction rate was much lower less negative peak potentials for α feooh electrode 0 702 v indicated that α feooh was least likely to be reduced however currents at the reduction peaks of fe3o4 and α feooh were 0 5 and 0 4 ma cm2 respectively indicating that the reduction rate was highest for fe3o4 which was consistent with high conductivity of fe3o4 abovementioned electrochemical assays allowed reduction characteristics of different iron oxides and pipe scale to be determined the results also revealed mechanisms involved in transformation of iron oxide scale in an anoxic environment which further verified that kuch s mechanism is valid in iron release in dwds 3 4 electrochemical characteristics of rusted iron electrodes 3 4 1 potentiodynamic polarization tests scale on rusted iron generally has a resistance to further corrosion and presents protection to inner iron substrate however this protection may be weakened under anoxic condition rusted iron electrodes were used as the working electrodes in the three electrode setup and current density responses at different potential polarizations were recorded as shown in fig s5 when no current pass through electrode potential of rusted iron electrode which is call the self corrosion potential changed from 0 586 v to 0 637 v after the electrode had been immersed in anoxic water for 2 weeks the negative shift of potential indicated an increase in corrosion tendency which might be caused by change of scale layer structure on electrode surface under anoxic conditions the structural change decreased the resistance to ion diffusion during electrochemical reactions corrosion current density for rusted iron electrode which was calculated using the tafel method increased from 13 3 μa cm2 to 16 2 μa cm2 after the electrode had been immersed in anoxic water for 2 weeks increase of current density implied the acceleration of corrosion rate indicating that protection provided by scale layer on the rusted iron electrode surface was weakened considering the previous scanning electron microscopy results these changes might be caused by more pores and cracks appearing on scale layer surface 3 4 2 electrochemical impedance spectroscopy impedance spectroscopy was performed to investigate characteristics of the rusted iron electrodes as well the results were used to plot nyquist diagrams shown in fig s6 the nyquist diagram contains a semicircle and an oblique line in high frequency part the capacitive reactance arc of electric double layer represents a kinetic control process and in low frequency part diffusion control exceeds electrochemical control resulting in warburg impedance titz et al 1992 by fitting in the zsimpwin software equivalent circuit can be constructed from impedance spectrum results shown in fig s7 thus solution resistance rs charge transfer resistance rct during a redox reaction capacitance of electric double layer cdl and warburg impedance wr wt wp representing diffusion of charge migrating to counter electrode can be estimated as shown in table s1 notably the charge transfer resistance rct of rusted iron electrode decreased by 24 after the electrode had been immersed in anoxic water for 2 weeks more cracks and pores formed on pipe scale surface and this would have increased the surface area available for charge transfer as fe3o4 is more conductive than other iron oxides an increase in proportion of fe3o4 in pipe scale will also make charge transfer occur more readily moreover the capacitance of electric double layer cdl of rusted iron electrode increased by 46 which might be caused by scale layer becoming thinner nigam et al 2006 guo et al 2020 the results reflected the transformations in pipe scale structure under anoxic conditions weakening the protection of pipe wall offered by scale layer this loss of protection increased corrosion tendency and corrosion rate 4 conclusions reactions of iron oxide scale leading to iron release in dwdss were studied by new approaches which simplify complex iron pipe scale into electrodes made of iron oxides and metallic iron the experiment results presented direct evidence for kuch s mechanism that reduction of iron oxide in pipe scale occurs under anoxic conditions main conclusions are shown below 1 micro morphology of pipe scale changed obviously when pipe section was immersed in anoxic water for months the outer surface of scale roughened and more cracks and pores appeared change of components of pipe scale under anoxic condition i e a decrease in the proportion of α feooh and an increase in the proportion of fe3o4 indicated the transformation of α feooh into fe3o4 2 by the galvanic cell reactor electromotive force between different iron oxides and metallic iron fe0 were measured which matched the values calculated using the nernst equation well detected current and changes in water chemistry also indicated that electrochemical reactions between iron oxides and metallic iron occurred 3 electrochemical tests using prepared iron oxide electrodes in the three electrodes setup present more details of reduction characteristics of iron oxides lepidocrocite γ feooh is most likely to be reduced but at a low rate magnetite fe3o4 also has a strong tendency to be reduced goethite α feooh has the weakest reduction ability but its reduction rate is rapid as goethite was found to be preferentially reduced in pipe scale it can be inferred that kinetics plays a leading role in reduction of iron oxide scales 4 electrochemical tests using rusted iron electrodes indicated that the protection of pipe wall by scale layer was weakened under anoxic condition
