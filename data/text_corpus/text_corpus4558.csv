22790,this paper deals with analytical experimental and numerical studies with respect to the rupture behaviors including the fracture initiation and crack propagation of a ship side plate induced by the lateral impact loading from a full shape bulbous bow indenter analytical expressions were developed to calculate the whole collapse resistance especially the initial fracture prediction and crack propagation resistance of the side plate small scale tests and numerical simulations were conducted to validate the proposed analytical method the specimens were quasi statically punched by a combine shaped bulbous indenter which is specifically designed to distinguish the fracture initiation and crack propagation behaviors the results from these three methods well correlated which confirmed the validation of the proposed analytical method in addition the experimental observations demonstrate that the crack propagation resistance is not related to the crack number generated in the plate moreover in the crack propagation process failure of the plate is due to the tension effect at the crack tips with high stress concentration and the plate can still absorb energy significantly after rupture finally the influence of friction effect on the collision response is discussed keywords collision ship side plate rupture behavior analytical method experiment numerical simulation crack

some serious situations as shown in fig 1 the striking bulbous bow will induce dramatic rupturing of the side shell when the striking energy is high the rupture behavior can be divided into two processes the fracture initiation and crack propagation this accidental scenario will cause serious plating rupture and lead to the opening of a large hole that is consistent not only with the shape of the bulbous bow but also with the bow structure behind the bulbous nose in most studies of plating rupture due to bulbous bow striking the rupturing behavior was investigated by primarily focusing on the fracture initiation which conformed to the shape of a bulbous nose however the subsequent crack propagation behaviors related to the bow structure behind the bulbous nose were often neglected calle and alves 2015 marinatos and samuelides 2015 calle et al 2017 gruben et al 2017 head on collision accidents have clearly demonstrated that the ultimate rupturing shapes of the side shell are normally determined by the combination of the bulbous nose and the bow structure behind the bulbous nose see in fig 1 in addition the rupture behavior of the ship side plate is more complicated when the two processes are taken into consideration to further clarify the rupture behavior this paper studies the shell plating rupture behavior during the whole deformation process and refers to three key points that are often considered during crashworthiness structural design 1 how can the crack initiation and crack propagation of shell plating be accurately described by analytical calculations 2 does the uncertainty of crack occurrence play an important role in affecting the energy dissipation capability of the side structure 3 what is the failure mechanism and energy dissipation ability of the ship side plate when suffering a head on collision with the structure behind the bulbous nose 4 to what extent does the friction effect influence the plate initial fracture and crack propagation resistance to answer these four questions the rupturing behavior of the side shell under the scenario of a high energy head on collision by a bulbous bow is analyzed in the present work and analytical methods for estimating the crack initiation and crack propagation are proposed the structural behavior of the side shell will then be summarized the commonly used approaches in ship collision investigations are classified as experimental numerical and simplified analytical method hong 2009 compared with the first two methods simplified analytical method is the preferred tool in the pre design stage amdahl 1983 zhang 1999 gao et al 2014 sun et al 2015 yu et al 2015 extensive analytical studies have been conducted to forecast the lateral resistance and fracture initiation of a single plate suffering lateral indentation by a sphere indenter simonsen and lauridsen 2000 lee et al 2004 gong et al 2015 however there are no globally acknowledged methods for plating rupture initiation in ship collision and grounding analysis moreover analytical solutions for crack propagation resistance after plate fracture have seldom been directly proposed one method proposed by wang et al 2000 is based on the plate tearing mechanisms where the force needed to drive the cone into the perforated plate is related to the crack number and the instantaneous crack length therefore the main purposes of the analytical method in present study are to build analytical equations for fracture prediction of the ship side plate and crack propagation resistance after plate fracture and to evaluate how much the crack number influences the resistance in crack propagation process when it comes to the crack propagation behavior of a ship side plate laterally punched by a bulbous bow previous studies have mostly produced qualitative conclusions for instance based on stiffened plate punching experiments alsos and amdahl 2009 stated that a ship side plate can exhibit significant post fracture resistance after the onset of fracture alves et al 2014 reported that subtle differences in the crack shape have a strong influence on the energy absorption capability of the ruptured structure after crack initiation recently morin et al 2017 clarified that crack propagation in the plate is dominated by slant shear failure which differs from plate initial fracture caused by ductile failure the phenomenon of crack propagation in the side plate can be clearly observed in double hull penetration experiments in which the outer hull was torn into several petals due to excessive indentation nevertheless in simulating the failure mechanisms of fracture initiation and crack propagation the corresponding failure criteria were generally not distinguished paik et al 1999 karlsson et al 2009 zhang et al 2018 all efforts have indicated that the crack propagation behavior of the plate warrants attention however this behavior has not been adequately resolved because the crack propagation behavior occurs immediately after plate fracture and the failure mode of crack propagation varies greatly compared to that of crack initiation for simplicity the energy dissipation due to crack propagation and the failure mechanism are studied in a relatively simpler manner e g in plane tension large scale ductile crack propagation experiments were conducted by simonsen and törnqvist 2004 with the purpose of developing and validating macroscopic crack propagation criteria in plate structures good agreement between the experiments and numerical simulations proved that a constant average critical fracture strain modeled with shell elements can adequately predict the crack propagation resistance of plates in addition the experimental data was further used to validate novel numerical simulation techniques by other researchers kõrgesaar and romanoff 2013 woelke et al 2015 current investigations of crack propagation in the plate mostly refer to the in plane loads whereas such idealistic conditions rarely occur in real situations due to various load conditions and inconsistencies in structural arrangements such as the form of stiffeners welds etc moreover the crack propagation behavior of ship side plate due to lateral punch in terms of the three key points previously mentioned still requires further in depth investigation since experiments can provide reliable data in terms of resistance response deformation mode and fracture patterns kiliclar et al 2016 gruben et al 2017 morin et al 2017 al tamimi et al 2018 cheng and lee 2018 duan et al 2018 therefore model tests are performed in this study to specifically investigate the rupture behavior of a ship side plate punched by the bow structure behind the bulbous nose and to validate the accuracy of the proposed analytical method besides the friction effects between the plate and the bulbous bow in the fracture initiation process and the crack propagation process can be different when the plate suffers large deformation the plate in the area contacted with the bulbous bow nose is assumed to maintain intact due to friction effect in analytical predictions gong et al 2015 lee et al 2004 liu et al 2014 simonsen and lauridsen 2000 in numerical simulation the friction coefficient can be varied between 0 2 and 0 4 and the most commonly used one is 0 3 alsos et al 2009 ehlers et al 2008 gruben et al 2016 2017 karlsson et al 2009 marinatos and samuelides 2015 zhang et al 2018 the effect of friction in the fracture initiation process can constrain the movement of the plate in the contacted area while in the crack propagation process the ruptured plate will slide on the surface of the bulbous bow which will dissipate a portion of energy the friction effects in these two processes can be varied therefore the influence of friction effect on the whole rupture behavior of ship side plate suffering impact load is deserved to be researched the present work is undertaken to investigate the whole rupture behavior of a scaled ship side shell laterally punched by a full shape bulbous bow indenter by using simplified analytical experimental and numerical simulation methods the rest of this paper is structured as follows section 2 presents analytical predictions for the resistance of the plate for the whole collapse process in section 3 experimental and numerical details of the punch indentation are described section 4 describes the verification and application of analytical predictions by experiments and numerical simulations in section 5 several aspects related to the rupture behavior of the plate are discussed conclusions are drawn in section 6 2 analytical predictions this chapter presents analytical predictions for the whole collapse process of a ship side plate suffering bulbous bow impact including the processes of large deformation fracture and crack propagation in a severe ship bulbous bow side collision scenario as shown in fig 2 ship side plate will be punched and penetrated by the bulbous bow in developing the analytical solutions several assumptions are made 1 the bulbous bow is assumed to vertically impact on ship side plate at the mid span between the web girders 2 the web girders are assumed to be stiff enough to constrain the boundary of the outer side plate 3 the bulbous bow is assumed to be rigid and the shape of the bulbous bow is simplified as a conical shape based on the assumptions theoretical deformation modes and the derived formulae for the plate due to large deformation and crack propagation are described below 2 1 large stretching deformation resistance the deformation resistance of the plate is described in this section in the theoretical analysis a rectangular plate with dimensions of 2a 0 2b 0 a 0 and b 0 are the half length and half width of the rectangular plate respectively constrained by the web girders is extracted as the struck object and the top of the bulbous bow is treated as a sphere moreover the plate sphere indentation system can be simplified as an axis symmetric problem simonsen and lauridsen 2000 lee et al 2004 gong et al 2015 thus the deformation mode of a clamped thin circular plate punched by a spherical indenter is shown in fig 3 the radius of the plate is the half width of the rectangular plate b 0 and the radius of the sphere is denoted as r b the total penetration depth of the plate is denoted as w p point c is the outermost contact point between the plate and the indenter and φ c is the angle from the center of the indenter to point c the plate is assumed to suffer mostly membrane stretching and the bending effect is neglected in addition the material element of the plate displaces only vertically in the large deformation process thus the circumferential strain can be neglected ε θ 0 simonsen and lauridsen 2000 lee et al 2004 gong et al 2015 and in the present paper the radial tension strain of the plate ε ρ is expressed as 1 ε ρ 1 cos φ 1 where φ is the angle between the horizontal line and the tangent line of a point on the plate considering the power law relationship of the plate material the tension force f ct supplied by the plate at point c can be expressed as 2 f c t 2 π r b sin φ c t p cos φ c k ε ρ n where k and n are the strength coefficient and work hardening exponent of the material respectively and t p is the initial plate thickness thus substituting eq 1 into eq 2 the indentation force supplied by the plate in the vertical direction f φ c can be obtained as 3 f φ c f c t sin φ c 2 π k t p r b 1 cos φ c 1 n cos φ c sin 2 φ c moreover the deformed plate is assumed to be expressed by a parabola in the ρ w coordinate system in current study where ρ and w are the horizontal and vertical distances from any point on the plate to the plate boundary moreover the symmetrical axis of the parabola is assumed to be horizontal to the plate tip thus the deformation shape can be expressed as 4 ρ w a w 2 2 a w p w where a is the coefficient determined in eq 8 the coordinate values at point c can be obtained as 5 w c w p r b r b cos φ c 6 ρ c b 0 r b sin φ c in addition point c is the tangent point of the plate and the indenter thus eq 4 satisfies the following relation 7 ρ w c 1 tan φ c a can be obtained by substituting eq 5 and eq 7 into eq 4 8 a 1 2 r b cos φ c 1 tan φ c point c is also the intersection point of the plate and the indenter and thus eq 4 also satisfies the relation 9 ρ w c ρ c substituting eqs 5 6 8 and 9 into eq 4 the total penetration depth of the plate can be obtained as 10 w p φ c 2 b 0 r b sin φ c r b 1 cos φ c tan φ c r b 2 1 cos φ c 2 by using eq 3 and eq 10 the penetration depth and corresponding values of the vertical resistance can be determined with a wrapping angle φ c 2 2 fracture prediction analytical fracture prediction of the ship side plate is crucial for estimating energy dissipation and structural resistance this section proposes an analytical method that can be used to predict the fracture initiation of a side shell under a bulbous bow striking scenario there are two main methods for forecasting the failure of the plate one is to calculate the maximum material strain that can give the penetration to fracture however this method requires extra calibrations by numerical simulations lee et al 2004 or experiments gong et al 2015 which is not convenient the other method is to consider failure from a stability point of view yu 1996 where the point of plate failure is assumed to be relevant to the peak of the resistance penetration curves f w p 0 simonsen and lauridsen 2000 liu et al 2014 the latter method is used to derive the critical penetration depth the accuracy of this method is strongly related to the function applied to express the tension strain and the difference of the current method is the solution of the tension strain which can lead to different expressions of the critical penetration depth therefore a correction coefficient is added in the current method to ensure the accuracy of the prediction result note that eq 3 is given as a function of the wrapping angle φ c thus the critical penetration depth w p f is determined by the critical value of φ c f which satisfies f φ c 0 the equation can be obtained as 11 3 cos φ c f 2 n cos φ c f n 1 0 the solution to eq 11 can be approximated by the expression 12 φ c f 1 n 3 substituting eq 12 into eq 10 and removing the relatively small quantities w p f can be approximated and expressed as 13 w p f c 1 7 n 0 76 b 0 r b where c 1 is the correction coefficient c 1 has been calibrated by model tests in recent years with a wide range of plate size and indenter scantling values table 1 summarizes the critical penetration depth from the experiments and analytical predictions when c 1 is equal to 0 5 the deviation of the critical penetration depth between the experiment and analytical prediction is less than 8 importantly the experiments conducted by liu et al 2014 were low velocity impact tests and the experimental data for an aluminum plate were used for comparison due to its strain rate insensitivity moreover in the experiments conducted by kõrgesaar et al 2018 and gruben et al 2017 the tested specimens were stiffened plates the influence of the attached stiffeners on the critical penetration depth for the plate was considered to be small in general the selected experiments are reasonable for calibrating the analytical method the acceptable match between the experimental and analytical results confirms that the calibrated value of c 1 is appropriate 2 3 crack propagation resistance after the plate is fractured due to indentation by the bulbous bow nose further indentation by the structure behind the bulbous nose can prompt crack propagation and the opening of a large hole in the ship side plate the shape of the bow structure after the bulbous nose is simplified as a cone thus the energy dissipation mechanism and lateral resistance force for the ruptured plate punched by a cone are examined in this section similar to the large stretching deformation mode of the plate shown in fig 3 the crack propagation mode for the side plating is also treated as axis symmetric fig 4 depicts the deformation mode of the ruptured plate the two deformation modes are bridged by two values as shown in fig 4 one is the radius of the necking circle when the plate is fractured denoted as r i which can be expressed as r i b 0 ρ c where ρ c is obtained by eq 6 the other is the rotation angle of the plate when the plate is initially fractured denoted as θ which is assumed to maintain constant in the perforating process according to the geometric relation θ can be expressed as 14 θ w p f r b 1 cos φ c f b 0 r b sin φ c f where φ cf is the corresponding wrapping angle of w p f moreover fig 4 illustrates the deformation and crack propagation process of the ruptured plate laterally punched by a cone initially radial bending of the plate is generated at point k1 and the subsequent bending of the plate can lead to in plane displacement u which will result in a circumferential tension in addition point k2 is assumed to be horizontal to the crack tips which means that the tension effect is limited in the arc of k1k2 beyond point k2 the ruptured plate is separated into several petals by the cracks when the petals contact the cone point k3 each petal of the plate will suffer circumferential bending because the ruptured plate will finally deform according to the shape of the indenter based on observations of actual collision scenarios fig 1 and model tests wang et al 2000 zhang et al 2018 for reference a sketch for the top view of the ruptured plate is plotted in fig 5 the solution process for the lateral resistance is described below the rate of membrane energy can be expressed as 15 e m p s m p σ 0 p t p ε θ d s m p where s mp is the area of the plate that suffers tension ε θ is the circumferential tension strain rate σ 0p is the flow stress of the plate and can be calculated by σ 0p σ y σ u 2 hong 2009 jones 2014 σ y and σ u are initial yield stress and ultimate tensile stress of the material respectively note that the rigid plastic material instead of the strain hardening material is used to derive the resistance in the crack propagation process for calculation convenience the circumferential tension strain can be expressed as 16 ε θ u r t p where r tp is the radius of the plate that experiences circumferential stretching and is appropriated as a constant distance from point t to the w axis u and r tp can be obtained through geometric relations and they are expressed as 17 u r 0 1 cos β sin α cos ζ r t p r i w i c tan α tan θ where r 0 is the radius of the curved surface α is the half spreading angle of the cone β is the angle between lines ok1 and ot w ic is the indentation depth at the crack propagation process ζ is the rotation angle of the plate from radial bending to circumferential bending and ζ α θ integrating eq 16 and eq 17 the strain rate ε θ can be approximated as 18 ε θ sin β sin 2 α r t p sin 2 ζ w i c thus the membrane energy rate can be obtained by substituting eq 18 into eq 15 19 e m p 2 π σ 0 p t p sin 2 α 1 cos β max r 0 sin 2 ζ w i c where β max is the angle between lines ok1 and ok2 according to the geometric relation 1 cosβ max can be approximated as 20 1 cos β max 1 2 sin θ 1 cos ζ sin α cos ζ for the radial bending effect the bending energy rate can be expressed as follows 21 e b 1 p m b p β l b 1 p where m bp is the bending moment per unit length of the plate and can be obtained as m b p σ 0 t p 2 p 4 and l b1p is the length of the bending hinge lines and can be expressed as 22 l b 1 p 2 π r b p where r bp is radius of the circular hinge line and can be expressed as 23 r b p r t p r 0 tan ζ 2 cos θ in addition the instantaneous rotation angle rate β can be expressed as 24 β cos α r 0 sin ζ w i c thus the radial bending energy rate can be obtained by substituting eqs 22 24 into eq 21 25 e b 1 p π σ 0 p t p 2 cos α r b p 2 sin ζ w i c r 0 in addition the circumferential bending hinge line rate can be expressed as 26 l b 2 p β r 0 cos α sin ζ w i c the circumferential bending energy rate can be expressed as 27 e b 2 p m b p 2 π l b 2 p π σ 0 p t p 2 cos α 2 sin ζ w i c the equilibrium of the ruptured plate cone system can be expressed via the principle of virtual work 28 f p w i c e m p e b 1 p e b 2 p where f p is the plastic resistance force substituting eqs 19 25 and 27 into eq 28 f p is obtained as 29 f p π σ 0 p t p 2 cos α 2 sin ζ r b p r 0 1 2 4 π σ 0 p t p cos α sin θ 1 cos ζ sin ζ cos 2 ζ r 0 where r bp and θ can be obtained from eq 23 and eq 14 respectively minimizing the plastic force with respect to the rolling radius r 0 yields the following 30 r 0 cos ζ 2 t p r t p sin θ 1 cos ζ the contribution of friction is also considered in the perforating process and it is related to the friction coefficient μ estimated as 0 3 and the half spreading angle of the cone α according to ohtsubo and wang 1995 and zhang 2002 the total resistance force f c can be expressed as 31 f c f p 1 μ tan α 3 experimental and numerical setup model tests and numerical simulations are performed to validate the derived analytical expressions another purpose is to investigate the collapse characteristics of a ship side structure subjected to a head on collision by a full shape bulbous bow especially the out of plane crack propagation behavior after plate fracture 3 1 penetration test design one of the purposes for the model tests is to validate the derived analytical expressions another purpose is to investigate the collapse characteristics of a ship side plate subjected to a head on collision by a full shape bulbous bow especially the crack propagation behavior after plate fracture the quasi static indentation experiments were performed at huazhong university of science and technology the setup is presented in fig 6 the specimens were clamped between a bottom flange and an upper flange which are made of q345 steel with a thickness of 25 mm they were fixed together by m20 bolts since the boundary conditions in experimental settings can strongly affect the tested results villavicencio and guedes soares 2011 liu et al 2018 current fixtures have been proven to provide clamped boundary constraints through validation by numerical simulations with solid elements considering all fixtures the deformation of the specimens is enforced at a rate of 10 mm min on the middle span by two hydraulic cylinders which were connected in series to obtain sufficient loading distance a 100 ton load cell fixed between the hydraulic cylinder and the indenter and two displacement sensors jointed on the indenter were utilized to obtain the force time and displacement time curves respectively to visualize the deformations 50 50 mm grids were drawn on the front and rear sides of the specimens moreover two cameras were placed under the bottom flange to capture the deformation process of the specimens in general in model tests the bulbous bow is treated as rigid and simplified as a conical indenter with the top radius wang et al 2000 alsos and amdahl 2009 nevertheless in this study in order to investigate the fracture initiation and crack propagation behaviors separately the indenter is designed as a combined shape as depicted in fig 7 the hemispherical end cap of the indenter is used to punch the specimen to fracture the cylinder part provides an interval from crack initiation to propagation the cone part enables the cracks on the plate to spread to a large area under lateral indentation the geometry of the indenter is also shown in fig 7 the dimensions of the specimen is illustrated in fig 8 where the central 600 600 mm square is the exposed area of the panels and the surrounding areas with a width of 155 mm are applied to clamp the specimens moreover replicate tests for the specimen are performed to ensure the reliability of the experimental results because the crack number and crack propagation paths produced in the plate may be uncontrolled 3 2 tensile tests tensile tests with standard and notched pieces are performed to determine the elastic plastic behavior of the specimens and to characterize the failure of fracture initiation and crack propagation in numerical simulations the material used for the plates is grade b normal structural steel qualified by ccs china classification society these steel plates are from the same batch supplied by the wisco company wuhan iron and steel group company and are 3 15 mm in thickness to obtain the mechanical properties of the steel quasi static tensile tests are conducted using standard tensile specimens and procedures the dimensions of the machined tension test pieces are shown in fig 9 a based on the displacement prescribed tensile tests performed on the universal testing machine the engineering stress strain behavior of the material can be obtained moreover the equivalent stress strain relationship is represented by a power law relation 32 σ e q σ y if ε e q ε p l a t k ε e q n otherwise where σ eq and ε eq are the equivalent stress and the equivalent strain respectively ε plat denotes the equivalent plastic strain at the plateau exit the mechanical properties of the plate material are summarized in table 2 and the tensile stress strain curves are presented in fig 10 based on the shape of the specimens in simonsen and törnqvist 2004 a homologous tension piece with a crack ending in a radius is designed to calibrate the parameters applied in the numerical simulation to predict the failure of crack propagation the dimensions of the test piece are shown in fig 9 b during the tension test the tension force and the relative displacement in the scope of the gauge length are obtained the experimental results are shown in fig 11 after the maximum load the piece begins tearing and the cracks spread in the width direction as the crack length increases the drag force decreases gradually the force displacement curve shows that the notched piece will experience a period of crack propagation after the crack initiates in contrast to the instant dropping of the load in the standard tension test as shown in fig 10 this period can provide data for calibrating the failure of crack propagation in the numerical simulation 3 3 numerical analysis the numerical analyses are performed using the explicit fe code ls dyna hallquist 2006 the finite element model includes the deformation part of the specimen and the indenter fig 12 for simplicity the clamping system depicted in fig 6 is not included in the numerical model because the fixtures have been proven to provide clamped boundary constraints not only in previous experiments cho and lee 2009 gong et al 2015 lee et al 2004 but also through validation by numerical simulations with solid elements considering all fixtures the plate is modeled by four node shell elements with five integration points throughout the thickness the mesh size is 3 0 mm for the plate to obtain detailed information on crack propagation contact between the indenter and the plate is accounted for by applying the single surface contact algorithm the static and dynamic coefficients of friction are set as 0 3 furthermore the indenter is set to hit the specimen at some offset from the plate center because offsets are introduced between the indenter and the specimens in the model tests the failure criterion selected to predict fracture initiation of the plate is the eps effective plastic strain criterion due to its convenience and accuracy when l e t is less than 2 calle et al 2017 kõrgesaar and romanoff 2014 the critical failure strain required to give the experimental material fracture strain of the specimens is determined through numerical simulations of the standard tension test piece as shown in fig 10 thus the critical failure strain for the plate and stiffener materials is estimated to be 0 6 with an element size of 3 mm the eps criterion can also be used to predict the crack propagation resistance of ship plating simonsen and törnqvist 2004 based on the tension test results for the notched piece a numerical simulation is performed to obtain the rupture strain to forecast the tearing resistance fig 11 shows the numerical predicted force displacement response and the final deformation shape of the notched tension piece in the process prior to element failure the numerical predicted resistance is lower because the radial fillets at the end of the cracks are not considered in the numerical model after element failure large oscillations arise due to the sudden removal of each element however the whole experimental force displacement response is forecasted well by the numerical simulation and the critical plastic strain applied is estimated to be 0 4 with an element size of 3 mm to simulate these two failure modes precisely in one finite element model the specimens are divided into two parts as shown in fig 12 the failure strain for the central square shell 144 144 mm marked with blue color is defined as 0 6 because the fracture initiates in this region for the rest of the model the failure strain is defined as 0 4 because these areas will experience crack propagation 4 verification and application of the analytical method in this section the proposed analytical method is verified with respect to the critical penetration depth resistance after plate rupture and crack propagation resistance by comparing the results from the analytical experimental and numerical simulation methods the resistance penetration responses are shown in fig 13 the whole collapse processes of the specimen can be categorized into two rupture processes the fracture initiation process and crack propagation process to further clarify the accuracy of the analytical method five specific moments of the resistance penetration curve are analyzed moreover the corresponding deformation shapes at these moments for the specimen are depicted in fig 14 at moment a necking appears on the plate fig 14 a the plate is subsequently fractured accompanied by a rapid load decrease the compared curves shown in fig 13 demonstrate that the analytical method can adequately predict the resistance due to the large deformation and fracture initiation of the plate at moment b disparities can be observed when the ruptured specimen is punched by the spherical top of the indenter the experimental response curve decreases gradually when the resistance force drops to some extent in this process several cracks will be generated on the plate around the necking circle fig 14 b which illustrates that a portion of the energy contributes to the initiation of the cracks the plate will subsequently experience crack propagation but this plastic behavior is neglected in the analytical method which may lead to a lower amount of energy dissipation prediction after the top hat of the specimen is pushed aside by the indenter the cylinder part of the indenter will penetrate the specimen to form a large hole in this process some lateral resistance remains fig 13 that is originated from the sliding effect between the top hat of the ruptured plate and the indenter fig 14 c in the analytical method the solution of the resistance in this process is not considered however the sliding distance w slide can be obtained according to the deformation shape of the plate expressed by eq 4 and the geometry relation shown in fig 15 the sliding distance calculated for the specimen is 161 03 mm from moment c to moment d the cone part of the indenter will press the ruptured plate and the corresponding resistance will increase remarkably in the analytical solution it is assumed that the resistance increases linearly the ruptured plate will be gradually transformed into the deformation mode depicted in fig 4 where the penetration depth needed in the transformation process is the vertical distance between point k1 and point k3 w k the distance is obtained as 2 76 mm according to the geometric relation at moment d the crack propagation mode of the plate is generated and the subsequent process is the crack propagation process moment e according to eq 31 the resistance penetration response can be obtained the detailed calculation process is shown in fig 16 note that the length of the circumferential bending hinge line in the curved plate will gradually increase with the punch of the cone which can lead to an increase in the resistance the compared curves in fig 13 demonstrate that the analytical method is able to accurately predict the crack propagation resistance of the plate in general the proposed analytical method can adequately predict most of the plastic resistance in the current experiment except the resistance needed to start the cracks moment b the current experiments are designed to separate the crack initiation and crack propagation processes for a ship side plate impacted by a full shape bulbous bow to investigate the energy dissipation mechanisms more clearly and to assess the amounts of energy dissipated in the crack propagation process and that in the crack initiation process individually however in an actual ship bow side collision scenario the process of the load decreasing nearly to zero and subsequent load increasing i e from moment b to moment d in fig 13 will not appear because crack propagation follows plate fracture see the experiments performed by wang et al 2000 alsos and amdahl 2009 and zhang et al 2018 therefore the results demonstrate that the proposed analytical method can well forecast the overall collapse behavior of a ship side plate impacted by a full shape bulbous bow finally the applicability of the proposed analytical method is presented the analytical equations in both the fracture initiation process and the crack propagation process are built based on that the struck plate is assumed to be circular however most of the ship plate panels are rectangular plates for the large deformation resistance the punch force is obtained by calculating the tension force at the outmost contact edge of the plate around the indenter where the plate side can influence the local damage slightly for the critical penetration depth initial fracture will happen at the position that the indenter is closest to the plate edge since the corresponding radial tension strain is largest thus the critical penetration depth is not related to the length of the plate edge for the crack propagation resistance the ruptured plate deforms as the shape of the indenter and the tension and bending effects are all produced around the indenter thus the influence of the plate edge on the crack propagation resistance is quite limited moreover numerical simulations of rectangular plates with different length width ratios are performed as shown in fig 17 the resistance penetration curves are close which also demonstrates that the equations derived based on circular plate boundary can predict the resistance of a rectangular plate punched by a cone therefore current equations can be applied to calculate the resistance of ship side plate suffering head on collision by a striking ship equipped with a bulbous bow in this case ship side plate will experience large stretching deformation initial fracture and subsequent crack propagation nevertheless the assumed case is limited compared with actual collision scenarios as stated in section 2 where the boundary of the collided plate is fixed the impact position on the plate is at the mid span the impact angle is vertically the bulbous bow is undeformable and the shape of the bulbous bow is conical the application of proposed method to these cases should be further researched 5 discussions in addition to verifying the proposed analytical method the experiments and numerical simulations can clarify the other three key points mentioned in the introduction 5 1 influence of crack number several replicate tests are performed and the corresponding crack numbers generated in the specimens are found to be different thus the influence of the crack number on the resistance response is studied in this section the resistance penetration responses are shown in fig 18 which indicates excellent test repeatability as the curves practically overlap however the numbers of cracks observed in each damaged specimen are not the same as shown by the permanent deformation shapes in fig 19 with 4 6 cracks produced in the specimens the energy dissipation mechanisms for crack propagation section 2 3 can explain why the crack propagation resistances are nearly identical but the numbers of cracks are different in the crack propagation process the energy dissipated by the specimens involves radial and circumferential bending in each petal and stretching before the plate experiences fracture these deformation behaviors are related to the circumferential parameters instead of the crack number these results illustrate that the number of cracks has insignificant influence on the total crack propagation resistance moreover in order to clarify the reason why the number of cracks generated on the plate is different the damage forms of the plates at moments before and after cracks generation are researched as shown in fig 20 the initial fracture of the plate around the necking circle can lead to not only a top hat connected with adjacent plate but also an arc of free edge marked with blue lines in fig 20 with the punch of the indenter cracks will initiate around the free edges as the length of the arc lines can be judged by the central angle it can be found that larger central angle corresponds to more crack number fig 20 before cracks are generated the free edges of the plates suffer circumferential tension effect due to the punch of the indenter when exceeding the maximum bearing limit cracks initiate around the free edges and longer free edge will be separated by more cracks thus it demonstrates that the number of crack produced on the plate is related to the length of the free edge produced when the plate is initially fractured 5 2 behavior of a ship side plate in crack propagation process the behaviors of a ship side plate subjected to a head on collision by a bulbous nose including large deformation and ductile tension failure have been extensively investigated in previous studies by contrast the behavior of the ship side plate driven by the structure behind the bulbous nose is seldom referred to in the current experiments the ruptured specimens are separated into several petals due to the punching of the cone part of the indenter the failure mode of the plate is shown in fig 21 where model i cracks are produced in the plate the material fails due to in plane tension effect at the crack tips in the crack initiation process plate fracture is also caused by the tension effect however the stress concentration at the crack tips in the crack propagation process can lead to a lower breaking strength which indicates that the force required to advance the cracks is lower than the plate without cracks in addition the tension effect concentrates in the circumferential area before the cracks arrive rather than in the whole plate thus the absorbed energy contributed by the tension effect in the crack propagation process is much smaller than that in the crack initiation process however by adding the bending effects in the plate a significant portion of the energy can be dissipated in the crack propagation process compared with that in the crack initiation process as shown in fig 18 current analytical method demonstrates that the energy dissipated due to tension effect is about 44 to that dissipated due to bending effects it illustrates that both bending and tension effects play an important role in crack propagation process moreover the deformation energy can be obtained by integrating the area beneath the curve of resistance vs penetration treating moment b as the division of the two processes the experimental values of the energy dissipated e 1 and e 2 by each specimen in the two rupture processes are summarized in table 3 including the energy dissipated by the experiment and replicate tests denoted as us us r1 and us r2 in the specimens the ratios of energy absorbed in the crack propagation process to that in the crack initiation process reach 1 these results illustrate that a large portion of the impact energy can be absorbed by the ship side plate with the punch of the bow structure behind the bulbous nose in an accident of a ship suffering serious collisions 5 3 friction effect in order to demonstrate the influence of friction effect on the collision resistance numerical simulations with different friction coefficients μ 0 2 0 3 and 0 4 are conducted as shown in fig 22 in the fracture initiation process the friction effect can influence the critical penetration depth significantly as stated in the introduction the friction effect can constrain the plate contacted with the indenter and the constraint effect for the numerical simulation with larger friction coefficient is stronger which will result in earlier plate fracture it illustrates that an extent of sliding can happen between the plate and the indenter because the friction effect can influence the initial fracture of the plate however the plate contacted with the indenter is assumed to be intact in most analytical solutions and the analytically predicted critical penetration depth is irrelevant with the friction coefficient therefore further analytical study of the influence of the friction effect on the plate initial fracture is needed in the crack propagation process the compared curves show that larger friction coefficient can lead to larger resistance and the discrepancies of resistance for the analytical solution are more obvious than that of the numerical simulation attention that the analytical predicted responses for the three friction coefficients are obtained based on the same critical penetration depth thus the angles between the ruptured plate and the horizontal line θ in fig 4 are the same which is different from the case in numerical simulations if the critical penetration depths obtained by numerical simulations are used to calculate the analytical crack propagation resistance the discrepancies for the analytical results with different friction coefficients would be smaller in general the friction effect in crack propagation process plays an important role and the analytical expression can predict the resistance well with different friction coefficients 6 conclusions this paper investigates the whole collapse behavior of a ship side plate impacted by a full shape bulbous bow including large deformation to fracture and crack propagation analytical expressions were developed to calculate the impact resistance especially the fracture initiation and crack propagation the proposed analytical method was proved to be reliable by good correlation against the quasi static test and numerical simulation where unstiffened plates were laterally punched by a combine shaped indenter moreover several conclusions can be drawn based on discussions they are listed as follow 1 in the crack propagation process the numbers of cracks generated on the specimens were found to be random between 4 and 6 the crack propagation resistance is attributed to radial and circumferential bending in each petal of the specimen and circumferential stretching in the area before the cracks approach the total crack propagation resistances of the specimens were found nearly identical by summing up these effects even though the numbers of cracks were different 2 the failure of the perforated plate laterally punched by a cone is due to the tension effect at the crack tips with high stress concentration model i crack 3 the punch of the structure behind the bulbous bow nose can lead to energy dissipation of the ruptured plate due to bending and tension effects current experimental results show that the amount of energy dissipated by the punching of the structure behind the bulbous nose is nearly equal to that dissipated by the punch of the bulbous bow nose neglecting this portion of energy produced by the structure behind the bulbous nose will no doubt result in an underestimate of the energy dissipation ability of a ship side plate in a head on collision 4 the friction effect can influence the collision response in the fracture initiation process different extents of sliding can happen between the plate and the indenter when using different friction coefficients and larger friction coefficient can lead to smaller critical penetration depth in the crack propagation process the ruptured plate will slide on the surface of the indenter which will dissipate a portion of energy due to friction effect and the analytical method can predict the frictional resistance well acknowledgments the present work is supported by national natural science foundation of china grant no 51579110 and the natural science foundation of hubei

22790,this paper deals with analytical experimental and numerical studies with respect to the rupture behaviors including the fracture initiation and crack propagation of a ship side plate induced by the lateral impact loading from a full shape bulbous bow indenter analytical expressions were developed to calculate the whole collapse resistance especially the initial fracture prediction and crack propagation resistance of the side plate small scale tests and numerical simulations were conducted to validate the proposed analytical method the specimens were quasi statically punched by a combine shaped bulbous indenter which is specifically designed to distinguish the fracture initiation and crack propagation behaviors the results from these three methods well correlated which confirmed the validation of the proposed analytical method in addition the experimental observations demonstrate that the crack propagation resistance is not related to the crack number generated in the plate moreover in the crack propagation process failure of the plate is due to the tension effect at the crack tips with high stress concentration and the plate can still absorb energy significantly after rupture finally the influence of friction effect on the collision response is discussed keywords collision ship side plate rupture behavior analytical method experiment numerical simulation crack

some serious situations as shown in fig 1 the striking bulbous bow will induce dramatic rupturing of the side shell when the striking energy is high the rupture behavior can be divided into two processes the fracture initiation and crack propagation this accidental scenario will cause serious plating rupture and lead to the opening of a large hole that is consistent not only with the shape of the bulbous bow but also with the bow structure behind the bulbous nose in most studies of plating rupture due to bulbous bow striking the rupturing behavior was investigated by primarily focusing on the fracture initiation which conformed to the shape of a bulbous nose however the subsequent crack propagation behaviors related to the bow structure behind the bulbous nose were often neglected calle and alves 2015 marinatos and samuelides 2015 calle et al 2017 gruben et al 2017 head on collision accidents have clearly demonstrated that the ultimate rupturing shapes of the side shell are normally determined by the combination of the bulbous nose and the bow structure behind the bulbous nose see in fig 1 in addition the rupture behavior of the ship side plate is more complicated when the two processes are taken into consideration to further clarify the rupture behavior this paper studies the shell plating rupture behavior during the whole deformation process and refers to three key points that are often considered during crashworthiness structural design 1 how can the crack initiation and crack propagation of shell plating be accurately described by analytical calculations 2 does the uncertainty of crack occurrence play an important role in affecting the energy dissipation capability of the side structure 3 what is the failure mechanism and energy dissipation ability of the ship side plate when suffering a head on collision with the structure behind the bulbous nose 4 to what extent does the friction effect influence the plate initial fracture and crack propagation resistance to answer these four questions the rupturing behavior of the side shell under the scenario of a high energy head on collision by a bulbous bow is analyzed in the present work and analytical methods for estimating the crack initiation and crack propagation are proposed the structural behavior of the side shell will then be summarized the commonly used approaches in ship collision investigations are classified as experimental numerical and simplified analytical method hong 2009 compared with the first two methods simplified analytical method is the preferred tool in the pre design stage amdahl 1983 zhang 1999 gao et al 2014 sun et al 2015 yu et al 2015 extensive analytical studies have been conducted to forecast the lateral resistance and fracture initiation of a single plate suffering lateral indentation by a sphere indenter simonsen and lauridsen 2000 lee et al 2004 gong et al 2015 however there are no globally acknowledged methods for plating rupture initiation in ship collision and grounding analysis moreover analytical solutions for crack propagation resistance after plate fracture have seldom been directly proposed one method proposed by wang et al 2000 is based on the plate tearing mechanisms where the force needed to drive the cone into the perforated plate is related to the crack number and the instantaneous crack length therefore the main purposes of the analytical method in present study are to build analytical equations for fracture prediction of the ship side plate and crack propagation resistance after plate fracture and to evaluate how much the crack number influences the resistance in crack propagation process when it comes to the crack propagation behavior of a ship side plate laterally punched by a bulbous bow previous studies have mostly produced qualitative conclusions for instance based on stiffened plate punching experiments alsos and amdahl 2009 stated that a ship side plate can exhibit significant post fracture resistance after the onset of fracture alves et al 2014 reported that subtle differences in the crack shape have a strong influence on the energy absorption capability of the ruptured structure after crack initiation recently morin et al 2017 clarified that crack propagation in the plate is dominated by slant shear failure which differs from plate initial fracture caused by ductile failure the phenomenon of crack propagation in the side plate can be clearly observed in double hull penetration experiments in which the outer hull was torn into several petals due to excessive indentation nevertheless in simulating the failure mechanisms of fracture initiation and crack propagation the corresponding failure criteria were generally not distinguished paik et al 1999 karlsson et al 2009 zhang et al 2018 all efforts have indicated that the crack propagation behavior of the plate warrants attention however this behavior has not been adequately resolved because the crack propagation behavior occurs immediately after plate fracture and the failure mode of crack propagation varies greatly compared to that of crack initiation for simplicity the energy dissipation due to crack propagation and the failure mechanism are studied in a relatively simpler manner e g in plane tension large scale ductile crack propagation experiments were conducted by simonsen and törnqvist 2004 with the purpose of developing and validating macroscopic crack propagation criteria in plate structures good agreement between the experiments and numerical simulations proved that a constant average critical fracture strain modeled with shell elements can adequately predict the crack propagation resistance of plates in addition the experimental data was further used to validate novel numerical simulation techniques by other researchers kõrgesaar and romanoff 2013 woelke et al 2015 current investigations of crack propagation in the plate mostly refer to the in plane loads whereas such idealistic conditions rarely occur in real situations due to various load conditions and inconsistencies in structural arrangements such as the form of stiffeners welds etc moreover the crack propagation behavior of ship side plate due to lateral punch in terms of the three key points previously mentioned still requires further in depth investigation since experiments can provide reliable data in terms of resistance response deformation mode and fracture patterns kiliclar et al 2016 gruben et al 2017 morin et al 2017 al tamimi et al 2018 cheng and lee 2018 duan et al 2018 therefore model tests are performed in this study to specifically investigate the rupture behavior of a ship side plate punched by the bow structure behind the bulbous nose and to validate the accuracy of the proposed analytical method besides the friction effects between the plate and the bulbous bow in the fracture initiation process and the crack propagation process can be different when the plate suffers large deformation the plate in the area contacted with the bulbous bow nose is assumed to maintain intact due to friction effect in analytical predictions gong et al 2015 lee et al 2004 liu et al 2014 simonsen and lauridsen 2000 in numerical simulation the friction coefficient can be varied between 0 2 and 0 4 and the most commonly used one is 0 3 alsos et al 2009 ehlers et al 2008 gruben et al 2016 2017 karlsson et al 2009 marinatos and samuelides 2015 zhang et al 2018 the effect of friction in the fracture initiation process can constrain the movement of the plate in the contacted area while in the crack propagation process the ruptured plate will slide on the surface of the bulbous bow which will dissipate a portion of energy the friction effects in these two processes can be varied therefore the influence of friction effect on the whole rupture behavior of ship side plate suffering impact load is deserved to be researched the present work is undertaken to investigate the whole rupture behavior of a scaled ship side shell laterally punched by a full shape bulbous bow indenter by using simplified analytical experimental and numerical simulation methods the rest of this paper is structured as follows section 2 presents analytical predictions for the resistance of the plate for the whole collapse process in section 3 experimental and numerical details of the punch indentation are described section 4 describes the verification and application of analytical predictions by experiments and numerical simulations in section 5 several aspects related to the rupture behavior of the plate are discussed conclusions are drawn in section 6 2 analytical predictions this chapter presents analytical predictions for the whole collapse process of a ship side plate suffering bulbous bow impact including the processes of large deformation fracture and crack propagation in a severe ship bulbous bow side collision scenario as shown in fig 2 ship side plate will be punched and penetrated by the bulbous bow in developing the analytical solutions several assumptions are made 1 the bulbous bow is assumed to vertically impact on ship side plate at the mid span between the web girders 2 the web girders are assumed to be stiff enough to constrain the boundary of the outer side plate 3 the bulbous bow is assumed to be rigid and the shape of the bulbous bow is simplified as a conical shape based on the assumptions theoretical deformation modes and the derived formulae for the plate due to large deformation and crack propagation are described below 2 1 large stretching deformation resistance the deformation resistance of the plate is described in this section in the theoretical analysis a rectangular plate with dimensions of 2a 0 2b 0 a 0 and b 0 are the half length and half width of the rectangular plate respectively constrained by the web girders is extracted as the struck object and the top of the bulbous bow is treated as a sphere moreover the plate sphere indentation system can be simplified as an axis symmetric problem simonsen and lauridsen 2000 lee et al 2004 gong et al 2015 thus the deformation mode of a clamped thin circular plate punched by a spherical indenter is shown in fig 3 the radius of the plate is the half width of the rectangular plate b 0 and the radius of the sphere is denoted as r b the total penetration depth of the plate is denoted as w p point c is the outermost contact point between the plate and the indenter and φ c is the angle from the center of the indenter to point c the plate is assumed to suffer mostly membrane stretching and the bending effect is neglected in addition the material element of the plate displaces only vertically in the large deformation process thus the circumferential strain can be neglected ε θ 0 simonsen and lauridsen 2000 lee et al 2004 gong et al 2015 and in the present paper the radial tension strain of the plate ε ρ is expressed as 1 ε ρ 1 cos φ 1 where φ is the angle between the horizontal line and the tangent line of a point on the plate considering the power law relationship of the plate material the tension force f ct supplied by the plate at point c can be expressed as 2 f c t 2 π r b sin φ c t p cos φ c k ε ρ n where k and n are the strength coefficient and work hardening exponent of the material respectively and t p is the initial plate thickness thus substituting eq 1 into eq 2 the indentation force supplied by the plate in the vertical direction f φ c can be obtained as 3 f φ c f c t sin φ c 2 π k t p r b 1 cos φ c 1 n cos φ c sin 2 φ c moreover the deformed plate is assumed to be expressed by a parabola in the ρ w coordinate system in current study where ρ and w are the horizontal and vertical distances from any point on the plate to the plate boundary moreover the symmetrical axis of the parabola is assumed to be horizontal to the plate tip thus the deformation shape can be expressed as 4 ρ w a w 2 2 a w p w where a is the coefficient determined in eq 8 the coordinate values at point c can be obtained as 5 w c w p r b r b cos φ c 6 ρ c b 0 r b sin φ c in addition point c is the tangent point of the plate and the indenter thus eq 4 satisfies the following relation 7 ρ w c 1 tan φ c a can be obtained by substituting eq 5 and eq 7 into eq 4 8 a 1 2 r b cos φ c 1 tan φ c point c is also the intersection point of the plate and the indenter and thus eq 4 also satisfies the relation 9 ρ w c ρ c substituting eqs 5 6 8 and 9 into eq 4 the total penetration depth of the plate can be obtained as 10 w p φ c 2 b 0 r b sin φ c r b 1 cos φ c tan φ c r b 2 1 cos φ c 2 by using eq 3 and eq 10 the penetration depth and corresponding values of the vertical resistance can be determined with a wrapping angle φ c 2 2 fracture prediction analytical fracture prediction of the ship side plate is crucial for estimating energy dissipation and structural resistance this section proposes an analytical method that can be used to predict the fracture initiation of a side shell under a bulbous bow striking scenario there are two main methods for forecasting the failure of the plate one is to calculate the maximum material strain that can give the penetration to fracture however this method requires extra calibrations by numerical simulations lee et al 2004 or experiments gong et al 2015 which is not convenient the other method is to consider failure from a stability point of view yu 1996 where the point of plate failure is assumed to be relevant to the peak of the resistance penetration curves f w p 0 simonsen and lauridsen 2000 liu et al 2014 the latter method is used to derive the critical penetration depth the accuracy of this method is strongly related to the function applied to express the tension strain and the difference of the current method is the solution of the tension strain which can lead to different expressions of the critical penetration depth therefore a correction coefficient is added in the current method to ensure the accuracy of the prediction result note that eq 3 is given as a function of the wrapping angle φ c thus the critical penetration depth w p f is determined by the critical value of φ c f which satisfies f φ c 0 the equation can be obtained as 11 3 cos φ c f 2 n cos φ c f n 1 0 the solution to eq 11 can be approximated by the expression 12 φ c f 1 n 3 substituting eq 12 into eq 10 and removing the relatively small quantities w p f can be approximated and expressed as 13 w p f c 1 7 n 0 76 b 0 r b where c 1 is the correction coefficient c 1 has been calibrated by model tests in recent years with a wide range of plate size and indenter scantling values table 1 summarizes the critical penetration depth from the experiments and analytical predictions when c 1 is equal to 0 5 the deviation of the critical penetration depth between the experiment and analytical prediction is less than 8 importantly the experiments conducted by liu et al 2014 were low velocity impact tests and the experimental data for an aluminum plate were used for comparison due to its strain rate insensitivity moreover in the experiments conducted by kõrgesaar et al 2018 and gruben et al 2017 the tested specimens were stiffened plates the influence of the attached stiffeners on the critical penetration depth for the plate was considered to be small in general the selected experiments are reasonable for calibrating the analytical method the acceptable match between the experimental and analytical results confirms that the calibrated value of c 1 is appropriate 2 3 crack propagation resistance after the plate is fractured due to indentation by the bulbous bow nose further indentation by the structure behind the bulbous nose can prompt crack propagation and the opening of a large hole in the ship side plate the shape of the bow structure after the bulbous nose is simplified as a cone thus the energy dissipation mechanism and lateral resistance force for the ruptured plate punched by a cone are examined in this section similar to the large stretching deformation mode of the plate shown in fig 3 the crack propagation mode for the side plating is also treated as axis symmetric fig 4 depicts the deformation mode of the ruptured plate the two deformation modes are bridged by two values as shown in fig 4 one is the radius of the necking circle when the plate is fractured denoted as r i which can be expressed as r i b 0 ρ c where ρ c is obtained by eq 6 the other is the rotation angle of the plate when the plate is initially fractured denoted as θ which is assumed to maintain constant in the perforating process according to the geometric relation θ can be expressed as 14 θ w p f r b 1 cos φ c f b 0 r b sin φ c f where φ cf is the corresponding wrapping angle of w p f moreover fig 4 illustrates the deformation and crack propagation process of the ruptured plate laterally punched by a cone initially radial bending of the plate is generated at point k1 and the subsequent bending of the plate can lead to in plane displacement u which will result in a circumferential tension in addition point k2 is assumed to be horizontal to the crack tips which means that the tension effect is limited in the arc of k1k2 beyond point k2 the ruptured plate is separated into several petals by the cracks when the petals contact the cone point k3 each petal of the plate will suffer circumferential bending because the ruptured plate will finally deform according to the shape of the indenter based on observations of actual collision scenarios fig 1 and model tests wang et al 2000 zhang et al 2018 for reference a sketch for the top view of the ruptured plate is plotted in fig 5 the solution process for the lateral resistance is described below the rate of membrane energy can be expressed as 15 e m p s m p σ 0 p t p ε θ d s m p where s mp is the area of the plate that suffers tension ε θ is the circumferential tension strain rate σ 0p is the flow stress of the plate and can be calculated by σ 0p σ y σ u 2 hong 2009 jones 2014 σ y and σ u are initial yield stress and ultimate tensile stress of the material respectively note that the rigid plastic material instead of the strain hardening material is used to derive the resistance in the crack propagation process for calculation convenience the circumferential tension strain can be expressed as 16 ε θ u r t p where r tp is the radius of the plate that experiences circumferential stretching and is appropriated as a constant distance from point t to the w axis u and r tp can be obtained through geometric relations and they are expressed as 17 u r 0 1 cos β sin α cos ζ r t p r i w i c tan α tan θ where r 0 is the radius of the curved surface α is the half spreading angle of the cone β is the angle between lines ok1 and ot w ic is the indentation depth at the crack propagation process ζ is the rotation angle of the plate from radial bending to circumferential bending and ζ α θ integrating eq 16 and eq 17 the strain rate ε θ can be approximated as 18 ε θ sin β sin 2 α r t p sin 2 ζ w i c thus the membrane energy rate can be obtained by substituting eq 18 into eq 15 19 e m p 2 π σ 0 p t p sin 2 α 1 cos β max r 0 sin 2 ζ w i c where β max is the angle between lines ok1 and ok2 according to the geometric relation 1 cosβ max can be approximated as 20 1 cos β max 1 2 sin θ 1 cos ζ sin α cos ζ for the radial bending effect the bending energy rate can be expressed as follows 21 e b 1 p m b p β l b 1 p where m bp is the bending moment per unit length of the plate and can be obtained as m b p σ 0 t p 2 p 4 and l b1p is the length of the bending hinge lines and can be expressed as 22 l b 1 p 2 π r b p where r bp is radius of the circular hinge line and can be expressed as 23 r b p r t p r 0 tan ζ 2 cos θ in addition the instantaneous rotation angle rate β can be expressed as 24 β cos α r 0 sin ζ w i c thus the radial bending energy rate can be obtained by substituting eqs 22 24 into eq 21 25 e b 1 p π σ 0 p t p 2 cos α r b p 2 sin ζ w i c r 0 in addition the circumferential bending hinge line rate can be expressed as 26 l b 2 p β r 0 cos α sin ζ w i c the circumferential bending energy rate can be expressed as 27 e b 2 p m b p 2 π l b 2 p π σ 0 p t p 2 cos α 2 sin ζ w i c the equilibrium of the ruptured plate cone system can be expressed via the principle of virtual work 28 f p w i c e m p e b 1 p e b 2 p where f p is the plastic resistance force substituting eqs 19 25 and 27 into eq 28 f p is obtained as 29 f p π σ 0 p t p 2 cos α 2 sin ζ r b p r 0 1 2 4 π σ 0 p t p cos α sin θ 1 cos ζ sin ζ cos 2 ζ r 0 where r bp and θ can be obtained from eq 23 and eq 14 respectively minimizing the plastic force with respect to the rolling radius r 0 yields the following 30 r 0 cos ζ 2 t p r t p sin θ 1 cos ζ the contribution of friction is also considered in the perforating process and it is related to the friction coefficient μ estimated as 0 3 and the half spreading angle of the cone α according to ohtsubo and wang 1995 and zhang 2002 the total resistance force f c can be expressed as 31 f c f p 1 μ tan α 3 experimental and numerical setup model tests and numerical simulations are performed to validate the derived analytical expressions another purpose is to investigate the collapse characteristics of a ship side structure subjected to a head on collision by a full shape bulbous bow especially the out of plane crack propagation behavior after plate fracture 3 1 penetration test design one of the purposes for the model tests is to validate the derived analytical expressions another purpose is to investigate the collapse characteristics of a ship side plate subjected to a head on collision by a full shape bulbous bow especially the crack propagation behavior after plate fracture the quasi static indentation experiments were performed at huazhong university of science and technology the setup is presented in fig 6 the specimens were clamped between a bottom flange and an upper flange which are made of q345 steel with a thickness of 25 mm they were fixed together by m20 bolts since the boundary conditions in experimental settings can strongly affect the tested results villavicencio and guedes soares 2011 liu et al 2018 current fixtures have been proven to provide clamped boundary constraints through validation by numerical simulations with solid elements considering all fixtures the deformation of the specimens is enforced at a rate of 10 mm min on the middle span by two hydraulic cylinders which were connected in series to obtain sufficient loading distance a 100 ton load cell fixed between the hydraulic cylinder and the indenter and two displacement sensors jointed on the indenter were utilized to obtain the force time and displacement time curves respectively to visualize the deformations 50 50 mm grids were drawn on the front and rear sides of the specimens moreover two cameras were placed under the bottom flange to capture the deformation process of the specimens in general in model tests the bulbous bow is treated as rigid and simplified as a conical indenter with the top radius wang et al 2000 alsos and amdahl 2009 nevertheless in this study in order to investigate the fracture initiation and crack propagation behaviors separately the indenter is designed as a combined shape as depicted in fig 7 the hemispherical end cap of the indenter is used to punch the specimen to fracture the cylinder part provides an interval from crack initiation to propagation the cone part enables the cracks on the plate to spread to a large area under lateral indentation the geometry of the indenter is also shown in fig 7 the dimensions of the specimen is illustrated in fig 8 where the central 600 600 mm square is the exposed area of the panels and the surrounding areas with a width of 155 mm are applied to clamp the specimens moreover replicate tests for the specimen are performed to ensure the reliability of the experimental results because the crack number and crack propagation paths produced in the plate may be uncontrolled 3 2 tensile tests tensile tests with standard and notched pieces are performed to determine the elastic plastic behavior of the specimens and to characterize the failure of fracture initiation and crack propagation in numerical simulations the material used for the plates is grade b normal structural steel qualified by ccs china classification society these steel plates are from the same batch supplied by the wisco company wuhan iron and steel group company and are 3 15 mm in thickness to obtain the mechanical properties of the steel quasi static tensile tests are conducted using standard tensile specimens and procedures the dimensions of the machined tension test pieces are shown in fig 9 a based on the displacement prescribed tensile tests performed on the universal testing machine the engineering stress strain behavior of the material can be obtained moreover the equivalent stress strain relationship is represented by a power law relation 32 σ e q σ y if ε e q ε p l a t k ε e q n otherwise where σ eq and ε eq are the equivalent stress and the equivalent strain respectively ε plat denotes the equivalent plastic strain at the plateau exit the mechanical properties of the plate material are summarized in table 2 and the tensile stress strain curves are presented in fig 10 based on the shape of the specimens in simonsen and törnqvist 2004 a homologous tension piece with a crack ending in a radius is designed to calibrate the parameters applied in the numerical simulation to predict the failure of crack propagation the dimensions of the test piece are shown in fig 9 b during the tension test the tension force and the relative displacement in the scope of the gauge length are obtained the experimental results are shown in fig 11 after the maximum load the piece begins tearing and the cracks spread in the width direction as the crack length increases the drag force decreases gradually the force displacement curve shows that the notched piece will experience a period of crack propagation after the crack initiates in contrast to the instant dropping of the load in the standard tension test as shown in fig 10 this period can provide data for calibrating the failure of crack propagation in the numerical simulation 3 3 numerical analysis the numerical analyses are performed using the explicit fe code ls dyna hallquist 2006 the finite element model includes the deformation part of the specimen and the indenter fig 12 for simplicity the clamping system depicted in fig 6 is not included in the numerical model because the fixtures have been proven to provide clamped boundary constraints not only in previous experiments cho and lee 2009 gong et al 2015 lee et al 2004 but also through validation by numerical simulations with solid elements considering all fixtures the plate is modeled by four node shell elements with five integration points throughout the thickness the mesh size is 3 0 mm for the plate to obtain detailed information on crack propagation contact between the indenter and the plate is accounted for by applying the single surface contact algorithm the static and dynamic coefficients of friction are set as 0 3 furthermore the indenter is set to hit the specimen at some offset from the plate center because offsets are introduced between the indenter and the specimens in the model tests the failure criterion selected to predict fracture initiation of the plate is the eps effective plastic strain criterion due to its convenience and accuracy when l e t is less than 2 calle et al 2017 kõrgesaar and romanoff 2014 the critical failure strain required to give the experimental material fracture strain of the specimens is determined through numerical simulations of the standard tension test piece as shown in fig 10 thus the critical failure strain for the plate and stiffener materials is estimated to be 0 6 with an element size of 3 mm the eps criterion can also be used to predict the crack propagation resistance of ship plating simonsen and törnqvist 2004 based on the tension test results for the notched piece a numerical simulation is performed to obtain the rupture strain to forecast the tearing resistance fig 11 shows the numerical predicted force displacement response and the final deformation shape of the notched tension piece in the process prior to element failure the numerical predicted resistance is lower because the radial fillets at the end of the cracks are not considered in the numerical model after element failure large oscillations arise due to the sudden removal of each element however the whole experimental force displacement response is forecasted well by the numerical simulation and the critical plastic strain applied is estimated to be 0 4 with an element size of 3 mm to simulate these two failure modes precisely in one finite element model the specimens are divided into two parts as shown in fig 12 the failure strain for the central square shell 144 144 mm marked with blue color is defined as 0 6 because the fracture initiates in this region for the rest of the model the failure strain is defined as 0 4 because these areas will experience crack propagation 4 verification and application of the analytical method in this section the proposed analytical method is verified with respect to the critical penetration depth resistance after plate rupture and crack propagation resistance by comparing the results from the analytical experimental and numerical simulation methods the resistance penetration responses are shown in fig 13 the whole collapse processes of the specimen can be categorized into two rupture processes the fracture initiation process and crack propagation process to further clarify the accuracy of the analytical method five specific moments of the resistance penetration curve are analyzed moreover the corresponding deformation shapes at these moments for the specimen are depicted in fig 14 at moment a necking appears on the plate fig 14 a the plate is subsequently fractured accompanied by a rapid load decrease the compared curves shown in fig 13 demonstrate that the analytical method can adequately predict the resistance due to the large deformation and fracture initiation of the plate at moment b disparities can be observed when the ruptured specimen is punched by the spherical top of the indenter the experimental response curve decreases gradually when the resistance force drops to some extent in this process several cracks will be generated on the plate around the necking circle fig 14 b which illustrates that a portion of the energy contributes to the initiation of the cracks the plate will subsequently experience crack propagation but this plastic behavior is neglected in the analytical method which may lead to a lower amount of energy dissipation prediction after the top hat of the specimen is pushed aside by the indenter the cylinder part of the indenter will penetrate the specimen to form a large hole in this process some lateral resistance remains fig 13 that is originated from the sliding effect between the top hat of the ruptured plate and the indenter fig 14 c in the analytical method the solution of the resistance in this process is not considered however the sliding distance w slide can be obtained according to the deformation shape of the plate expressed by eq 4 and the geometry relation shown in fig 15 the sliding distance calculated for the specimen is 161 03 mm from moment c to moment d the cone part of the indenter will press the ruptured plate and the corresponding resistance will increase remarkably in the analytical solution it is assumed that the resistance increases linearly the ruptured plate will be gradually transformed into the deformation mode depicted in fig 4 where the penetration depth needed in the transformation process is the vertical distance between point k1 and point k3 w k the distance is obtained as 2 76 mm according to the geometric relation at moment d the crack propagation mode of the plate is generated and the subsequent process is the crack propagation process moment e according to eq 31 the resistance penetration response can be obtained the detailed calculation process is shown in fig 16 note that the length of the circumferential bending hinge line in the curved plate will gradually increase with the punch of the cone which can lead to an increase in the resistance the compared curves in fig 13 demonstrate that the analytical method is able to accurately predict the crack propagation resistance of the plate in general the proposed analytical method can adequately predict most of the plastic resistance in the current experiment except the resistance needed to start the cracks moment b the current experiments are designed to separate the crack initiation and crack propagation processes for a ship side plate impacted by a full shape bulbous bow to investigate the energy dissipation mechanisms more clearly and to assess the amounts of energy dissipated in the crack propagation process and that in the crack initiation process individually however in an actual ship bow side collision scenario the process of the load decreasing nearly to zero and subsequent load increasing i e from moment b to moment d in fig 13 will not appear because crack propagation follows plate fracture see the experiments performed by wang et al 2000 alsos and amdahl 2009 and zhang et al 2018 therefore the results demonstrate that the proposed analytical method can well forecast the overall collapse behavior of a ship side plate impacted by a full shape bulbous bow finally the applicability of the proposed analytical method is presented the analytical equations in both the fracture initiation process and the crack propagation process are built based on that the struck plate is assumed to be circular however most of the ship plate panels are rectangular plates for the large deformation resistance the punch force is obtained by calculating the tension force at the outmost contact edge of the plate around the indenter where the plate side can influence the local damage slightly for the critical penetration depth initial fracture will happen at the position that the indenter is closest to the plate edge since the corresponding radial tension strain is largest thus the critical penetration depth is not related to the length of the plate edge for the crack propagation resistance the ruptured plate deforms as the shape of the indenter and the tension and bending effects are all produced around the indenter thus the influence of the plate edge on the crack propagation resistance is quite limited moreover numerical simulations of rectangular plates with different length width ratios are performed as shown in fig 17 the resistance penetration curves are close which also demonstrates that the equations derived based on circular plate boundary can predict the resistance of a rectangular plate punched by a cone therefore current equations can be applied to calculate the resistance of ship side plate suffering head on collision by a striking ship equipped with a bulbous bow in this case ship side plate will experience large stretching deformation initial fracture and subsequent crack propagation nevertheless the assumed case is limited compared with actual collision scenarios as stated in section 2 where the boundary of the collided plate is fixed the impact position on the plate is at the mid span the impact angle is vertically the bulbous bow is undeformable and the shape of the bulbous bow is conical the application of proposed method to these cases should be further researched 5 discussions in addition to verifying the proposed analytical method the experiments and numerical simulations can clarify the other three key points mentioned in the introduction 5 1 influence of crack number several replicate tests are performed and the corresponding crack numbers generated in the specimens are found to be different thus the influence of the crack number on the resistance response is studied in this section the resistance penetration responses are shown in fig 18 which indicates excellent test repeatability as the curves practically overlap however the numbers of cracks observed in each damaged specimen are not the same as shown by the permanent deformation shapes in fig 19 with 4 6 cracks produced in the specimens the energy dissipation mechanisms for crack propagation section 2 3 can explain why the crack propagation resistances are nearly identical but the numbers of cracks are different in the crack propagation process the energy dissipated by the specimens involves radial and circumferential bending in each petal and stretching before the plate experiences fracture these deformation behaviors are related to the circumferential parameters instead of the crack number these results illustrate that the number of cracks has insignificant influence on the total crack propagation resistance moreover in order to clarify the reason why the number of cracks generated on the plate is different the damage forms of the plates at moments before and after cracks generation are researched as shown in fig 20 the initial fracture of the plate around the necking circle can lead to not only a top hat connected with adjacent plate but also an arc of free edge marked with blue lines in fig 20 with the punch of the indenter cracks will initiate around the free edges as the length of the arc lines can be judged by the central angle it can be found that larger central angle corresponds to more crack number fig 20 before cracks are generated the free edges of the plates suffer circumferential tension effect due to the punch of the indenter when exceeding the maximum bearing limit cracks initiate around the free edges and longer free edge will be separated by more cracks thus it demonstrates that the number of crack produced on the plate is related to the length of the free edge produced when the plate is initially fractured 5 2 behavior of a ship side plate in crack propagation process the behaviors of a ship side plate subjected to a head on collision by a bulbous nose including large deformation and ductile tension failure have been extensively investigated in previous studies by contrast the behavior of the ship side plate driven by the structure behind the bulbous nose is seldom referred to in the current experiments the ruptured specimens are separated into several petals due to the punching of the cone part of the indenter the failure mode of the plate is shown in fig 21 where model i cracks are produced in the plate the material fails due to in plane tension effect at the crack tips in the crack initiation process plate fracture is also caused by the tension effect however the stress concentration at the crack tips in the crack propagation process can lead to a lower breaking strength which indicates that the force required to advance the cracks is lower than the plate without cracks in addition the tension effect concentrates in the circumferential area before the cracks arrive rather than in the whole plate thus the absorbed energy contributed by the tension effect in the crack propagation process is much smaller than that in the crack initiation process however by adding the bending effects in the plate a significant portion of the energy can be dissipated in the crack propagation process compared with that in the crack initiation process as shown in fig 18 current analytical method demonstrates that the energy dissipated due to tension effect is about 44 to that dissipated due to bending effects it illustrates that both bending and tension effects play an important role in crack propagation process moreover the deformation energy can be obtained by integrating the area beneath the curve of resistance vs penetration treating moment b as the division of the two processes the experimental values of the energy dissipated e 1 and e 2 by each specimen in the two rupture processes are summarized in table 3 including the energy dissipated by the experiment and replicate tests denoted as us us r1 and us r2 in the specimens the ratios of energy absorbed in the crack propagation process to that in the crack initiation process reach 1 these results illustrate that a large portion of the impact energy can be absorbed by the ship side plate with the punch of the bow structure behind the bulbous nose in an accident of a ship suffering serious collisions 5 3 friction effect in order to demonstrate the influence of friction effect on the collision resistance numerical simulations with different friction coefficients μ 0 2 0 3 and 0 4 are conducted as shown in fig 22 in the fracture initiation process the friction effect can influence the critical penetration depth significantly as stated in the introduction the friction effect can constrain the plate contacted with the indenter and the constraint effect for the numerical simulation with larger friction coefficient is stronger which will result in earlier plate fracture it illustrates that an extent of sliding can happen between the plate and the indenter because the friction effect can influence the initial fracture of the plate however the plate contacted with the indenter is assumed to be intact in most analytical solutions and the analytically predicted critical penetration depth is irrelevant with the friction coefficient therefore further analytical study of the influence of the friction effect on the plate initial fracture is needed in the crack propagation process the compared curves show that larger friction coefficient can lead to larger resistance and the discrepancies of resistance for the analytical solution are more obvious than that of the numerical simulation attention that the analytical predicted responses for the three friction coefficients are obtained based on the same critical penetration depth thus the angles between the ruptured plate and the horizontal line θ in fig 4 are the same which is different from the case in numerical simulations if the critical penetration depths obtained by numerical simulations are used to calculate the analytical crack propagation resistance the discrepancies for the analytical results with different friction coefficients would be smaller in general the friction effect in crack propagation process plays an important role and the analytical expression can predict the resistance well with different friction coefficients 6 conclusions this paper investigates the whole collapse behavior of a ship side plate impacted by a full shape bulbous bow including large deformation to fracture and crack propagation analytical expressions were developed to calculate the impact resistance especially the fracture initiation and crack propagation the proposed analytical method was proved to be reliable by good correlation against the quasi static test and numerical simulation where unstiffened plates were laterally punched by a combine shaped indenter moreover several conclusions can be drawn based on discussions they are listed as follow 1 in the crack propagation process the numbers of cracks generated on the specimens were found to be random between 4 and 6 the crack propagation resistance is attributed to radial and circumferential bending in each petal of the specimen and circumferential stretching in the area before the cracks approach the total crack propagation resistances of the specimens were found nearly identical by summing up these effects even though the numbers of cracks were different 2 the failure of the perforated plate laterally punched by a cone is due to the tension effect at the crack tips with high stress concentration model i crack 3 the punch of the structure behind the bulbous bow nose can lead to energy dissipation of the ruptured plate due to bending and tension effects current experimental results show that the amount of energy dissipated by the punching of the structure behind the bulbous nose is nearly equal to that dissipated by the punch of the bulbous bow nose neglecting this portion of energy produced by the structure behind the bulbous nose will no doubt result in an underestimate of the energy dissipation ability of a ship side plate in a head on collision 4 the friction effect can influence the collision response in the fracture initiation process different extents of sliding can happen between the plate and the indenter when using different friction coefficients and larger friction coefficient can lead to smaller critical penetration depth in the crack propagation process the ruptured plate will slide on the surface of the indenter which will dissipate a portion of energy due to friction effect and the analytical method can predict the frictional resistance well acknowledgments the present work is supported by national natural science foundation of china grant no 51579110 and the natural science foundation of hubei

14 2 keywords fsi flexible hydrofoil deformation vibration characteristic transient 1 introduction the propellers equipped on marine ships are usually made of nickel aluminum bronze and produce thrust without consideration of flexibility recently the manufacturers of composite propellers have become widely concerned with the need for increasing efficiency as well as reducing weight and noise the researches on the bend twist coupling effect and the fluid structure interaction fsi performance are of vital importance to the process of taking advantage of the composite propellers flexibility as well as their anisotropic material properties and high damping vibration characteristics in contrast to traditional metal propellers to avoid the complexities of curvature changing and thickness changing blade geometries the flexible hydrofoils can be employed as the simplified lifting bodies of composite propellers which make them suitable for study using the fsi computational method the study of the hydrodynamic performance of rigid hydrofoils at different angles of attack is fundamental to the research of flexible hydrofoils these hydrodynamic performances including the pressure distribution force and flow regime of a pitching hydrofoil were studied by kinnas and fine 2006 ducoin et al 2008 ducoin et al 2009a b ducoin and young 2013a b huang et al 2013 and huang et al 2015 the phenomena of transition and stall at high angles of attack that caused by viscous effects may lead to fsi vibration when the object is a flexible hydrofoil the fsi is the dominant performance factor since the deformation and vibration are larger than these in metal hydrofoils the fsi deformations that can change the hydrodynamic force include the bend deflection along the span and the twist deflection along the chord the effects of the ply angles material elasticity and laminate thicknesses of a composite laminate were studied by robynne et al 2015 an experimental study on a bend twist coupled hydrofoil was carried out by herath et al 2013 in a separate study the fbg sensors were embedded in the hydrofoils to measure the deformation claire et al 2012 the fsi deformation was then simulated using finite element based fsi another simulation for a flexible hydrofoil replacing the turbomachinery agree very well with the experimental results conducted in a water tunnel campbell and paterson 2011 campbell and paterson 2011 simulated the flow and propulsion performance of rigid and flexible airfoils using the potential flow formulation showing fast convergence and good accuracy abbaspour and najafi 2018 huang et al 2016 and sun and xiong 2012 investigated the fsi performance of flexible propellers using bem and fem the transient fsi is another aspect that takes into account the time dependent deformation which can be seen as a vibration by transformation into frequency domain the experimental and numerical studies on the hydroelastic performances of hydrofoils by ducoin et al 2009a b ducoin and young 2013a b and ducoin et al 2012a b provided a great deal of information including the hydrodynamic deformation and vibration performances of hydrofoils made by steel and polyacetate material young et al 2018 experimentally and numerically studied the bend twist coupling effects by contrasting three composite and one stainless steel hydrofoils showing that the orientation of composite layers significantly affected the vibrating characteristics the hydrodynamic force fluctuations and natural frequencies of six different flexible hydrofoils of similar geometry were studied by zarruk et al 2014 the ply orientation influenced the dependence of the fsi hydrodynamic force and deflections on re the unsteady simulations taking fsi into account were validated with experiments which were carried out in the high speed cavitation tunnel by münch et al 2010 mulcahy et al 2010 and mulcahy 2010 researched the hydrodynamic performance

transient hydroelastic and sound power performance of a flexible propeller blade mulcahy et al 2014 the vibration characteristics of hydrofoils mainly include the natural frequency mode shape and fluid damping the influence of surrounding boundaries and material anisotropy on the vibration characteristics of submerged composite plates was investigated by motley et al 2013 and kramer et al 2013 the influence of skew on the marine propellers added mass and damping matrices was studied by mao and young 2016 the investigations on the role of fsi hydrodynamic damping and added mass effect were reviewed by trivedi 2017 gauthiera et al 2017 numerically simulated flow induced damping on a vibrating hydraulic turbine blade according to akcabay and young 2015 unsteady two phase flows with time varying fluid added mass effects may arouse additional modulated frequencies chae et al 2017 investigated the flow induced bend twist fsi effects wet natural frequencies and damping coefficients using a 2d viscous fsi model for fsi characteristics cavity induced vibration cannot be ignored for the hydroelastic performance of the pitching hydrofoils ducoin et al 2012 akcabay et al 2014 wu et al 2015 investigated the effect of bend twist coupling deformation on the cavitation pattern of rigid and flexible hydrofoils they then researched the association among the flow induced vibration frequency the cavity shedding frequency and the vibration frequencies wu et al 2018 the hydroelastic deformations and vibrations of hydrofoils induced by the turbulence are small but important for fundamental research on fsi because the fluid added mass cannot be ignored due to the flexibility the static and transient fsi simulation methods are illustrated the comparative deformation and vibration characteristics of rigid and flexible hydrofoils are analyzed in this paper based on the experimental results by ducoin et al 2009a b and ducoin and young 2013a b the aim of this paper is to form a simulating method to research the exciting force and the vibration characteristic of a flexible hydrofoil then is the study of the fsi vibration response and fsi noise in the future once the flexibility is considered the static fsi simulation is needed to determine the flexibility and the transient fsi simulation is needed to determine the vibration characteristic 2 numerical model 2 1 fluid model the flows around the pitching hydrofoils can be treated as viscous and incompressible fluids that meet the requirements for the navier stokes equations the cfx software divides the fluid domain solves the mass momentum and energy equations and then computes the pressure distribution and force the fluid simulation includes steady state analysis and transient analysis steady state analysis is a procedure used to calculate the hydrodynamic performance of fixed hydrofoils whereas transient analysis is a procedure used to calculate the time dependent hydrodynamic performance of pitching hydrofoils by solving the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations rans equations contain averaged and time varying fluctuating components to calculate the fluid pressure force of moving bodies using turbulence the turbulent characteristics are the key to simulating the hydrodynamic performance of pitching hydrofoils there are many turbulence models to compute the reynolds stresses which have different computational accuracies for the viscous eddy for different objects or conditions the choice of turbulence model should take into account the prediction accuracy of the boundary flow separation the k ω shear stress transport sst turbulence model simulates the inception and the amount of flow separation under adverse pressure gradients quite well ansys 2016 when pitching at a high angle the transition of laminar flow to turbulent flow occurs where the boundary layer flow separates and the local pressure presents inflexion to accurately simulate the separation induced transition the k ω sst turbulence model is coupled with a transition model γ r eθ the model sets r eθ as the critical reynolds number when the intermittency γ first starts to increase in the boundary layer the transition model is based on two transport equations one is for intermittency γ which triggers the transition process ducoin et al 2009a b 1 ρ γ t ρ u j γ x j p γ e γ x j μ μ t σ γ γ x j where p γ and e γ are the transition sources based on empirical correlations μ and μ t are the dynamic viscosity and turbulence viscosity respectively σ γ is a model constant another equation

turbulence as gamma theta with a specified γ and r e θ t in this paper the prediction of the transition length is good when γ is equal to 1 0 the analysis method above is used to simulate the time averaged force trend of hydrofoils however when the analysis aims at the fluid force fluctuation of the structure the transient analysis requires small time steps model such as the large eddy simulation les les is an approach that is good at simulating the transient fluctuating lifting force of different hydrofoils yielding good accuracy huang et al 2014 ji et al 2015 chen et al 2017 the les approach solves for large scale fluctuating motions and uses sub grid scale turbulence model for small scale motion ansys 2016 the rationale behind the les technique is a separation between the large and small scales the governing equations for les are obtained by filtering the time dependent n s equations in the physical space the filtering process effectively filters out eddies whose scales are smaller than the filter width or grid spacing the resulting equations thus govern the dynamics of the large eddies 4 ρ t x i ρ u i 0 and 5 t ρ u i x j ρ u i u j x j ν σ i j x j p x i τ i j x j where σ ij is the stress tensor caused by viscous fluid and τ ij denotes the sub grid scale sgs stress computed by smagorinsky lilly model ansys 2016 the sgs model compares dissipation of kinetic energy at sub grid scales to molecular diffusion in this case the separation part of τ i j is modeled as 6 τ i j 1 3 τ k k δ i j 2 μ t s i j where μ t represents the sgs viscosity these approaches require fine grids and small time steps with the values of the k ω sst simulation as initial conditions the frequency dependent pressure force is obtained by using the fourier transform 2 2 structure model the dynamic equation of motion with respect to a fixed solid body can be written as follows young 2007 7 k u c u m u f t where u u and u are the nodal displacement velocity and acceleration vectors respectively k c and m are the structural stiffness damping and mass matrices respectively the static structural analysis is a procedure used to calculate the displacement stress and strain data which are time independent the fsi deformation and stress are obtained with the combination of computational fluid dynamics cfd and computational structure dynamics csd the transient structural analysis is a procedure used to calculate the velocity and acceleration data which are related to inertia and damping the vibration performance of a flexible hydrofoil is studied using the transient csd coupled with the transient cfd the vibration characteristic is then calculated using the modal superposition method the transient displacement vector can be seen as the weighted superposition of every order of modal coordinates using the weight of participation factors the modal coordinates are the general solutions u t x sin ω t φ to the homogeneous equation k u c u m u 0 of the forced dynamic equation and can describe the vibrating shape at every natural frequency the frequency ω is the dry modal frequency ω i in the air condition however taking into account the fsi influence by establishing the fluid domain ω is the wet modal frequency ω i 2 3 fluid structure interaction model the calculation process is conducted on an ansys workbench 16 0 platform by coupling the csd software ansys mechanical and the cfd software cfx through mfx multiple physical field solver the cfx is the dominant base used to control the data transfer iteration output and post processing the fsi procedure is shown in fig 1 during the fsi calculation the total time and time steps are set in cfd and csd simultaneously they are the synchronization points at which the data transfer and the mesh mapping are carried out based on this setup the outer time loop and the inner stagger loop are run in order to solve the fluid model and the structure model unlike the wall boundary set in the hydrodynamic simulation of rigid hydrofoils the mesh motion and mesh deformation are set at the coupling interface in the fsi simulation in order to obtain the motion and deformation of flexible hydrofoils the data transfer is conducted under the premise of mesh mapping between the fluid and structure domains using the multi field mesh motion method the two way fsi analysis is a procedure used to transfer the converged total force in cfd rms residual of 1 10 6 is met or iteration number of 10 is reached and the converged total mesh displacement in csd program controlled in the coupling interface at every coupling time step the total mesh displacement contains the boundary motion and the structure deformation the convergence must be achieved in a stagger loop inside cfd and csd and a time loop at every time step the one way fsi analysis is a procedure used to transfer the converged fluid pressure in cfd to the structure for the calculation of deformation and vibration in csd without feedback the data transfer between the fluid and the structure interfaces is conducted using mesh mapping and interpolation the total mesh displacement transfer is interpolated with the profile preserving interpolation method fig 2 a which is a bucket search arithmetic method that ensures the same total data field while the total force transfer is interpolated with the conservative interpolation method fig 2 b which is a tree search arithmetic method that converts the 3 d surface data to a 2 d control surface and intersects with areas that surround the receiving side node when starting the coupling loop mesh mapping is performed only once to establish the relationship between the structure and the fluid mesh which is the basis of data transfer the mapping will not change with the mesh motion because the mesh node ip has been defined the mesh mapping and the data transfer of the flexible hydrofoil in this paper work well as shown in figs 3 and 4 the process of coupling and data transfer can reveal the fsi mechanism and lay the foundation for the control of the fsi setup in different conditions 3 hydrodynamic simulation of a rigid hydrofoil based on the hydrodynamic performance analysis of a steel hydrofoil the hydrodynamic performance and static deformation analysis of a flexible hydrofoil is conducted in order to explore the fsi calculating method the turbulent characteristic of a rigid hydrofoil is complex which is the basis for further research on the fsi characteristic of a geometric equivalent flexible hydrofoil 3 1 numerical set up for a rigid pitching hydrofoil in the cavitation tunnel experimented on by ducoin et al 2012a b the hydrodynamic performance under the condition of a pitching velocity of 6 s from 0 and a nominal free stream velocity of 5 m s is simulated in this section the hydrofoil is a rectangular cantilevered naca66 foil with a 0 15 m chord length a 0 191m span length and a naca 0 8 camber distribution with a maximum thickness of 0 018 m and a maximum camber of 0 003 m more information about this experiment can be found in ducoin et al 2012a b the modeling of the fluid domain is done first the usual modeling method is a combination of the inner column domain for the hydrofoil s rotation and the outer cube domain for the infinite water the same method as marine propellers however the hydrodynamic performance has a large error when compared with the experimental results since the rotational inner domain needs a wide range of space that does not capture the limit of the wall effect therefore a single cube domain is adopted due to its excellent capture of the wall boundary although this domain has the disadvantage of divergence caused by mesh deformation when pitching at large angle consequently the remeshing strategy has to be investigated here 3 2 boundary motion and remeshing method the specified rotational motion of the hydrofoil is set in cfx to simulate its pitching performance the structured mesh is partitioned with refinement near the boundary layer to separate the fluid domain when pitching at a large angle condition the remeshing process is performed to rebuild a new mesh and start with a new simulation the boundary motion identification and remeshing procedure is shown in fig 5 the first step is geometry modeling and meshing in icem including setting up the block and the mesh seed see fig 5 the c type structural mesh and the association of points and lines with geometry are conducted beforehand in order to make the remesh fine figs 6 and 7 the replay scripts are necessary since the automatic remeshing will be read later the boundary conditions and time steps are set in cfx pre along with the mesh distortion parameter and the rebuild trigger identification as the time step runs the simulation is interrupted at the mesh orthogonality trigger condition and starts with the geometry rebuilding and remeshing using the former scripts the remeshing may occur many times if the mesh is tiny or the pitching angle is large for the pitching hydrofoil the rotational motion parameter association is difficult since the cfx remeshing can only identify the translational motion thus the conversion of the rotation to translation has to be researched through the program fig 8 the center of mass of the rotated hydrofoil in cfx is δx f δy f which will be identified as δx i δy i is shown as 8 δ x δ d cos θ δ y δ d sin θ δ d 2 r sin θ 2 where δ d is the centroid moving distance and θ is the rotated angle the method of boundary motion and remeshing is carried out for the rigid pitching hydrofoil the 3d fluid domain and mesh are shown in fig 9 the inlet boundary with a velocity of u 5 m s is before the leading edge with a distance of 1 c while the outlet boundary with a reference pressure of 0pa is behind the trailing edge with a distance of 2 c the top and bottom boundaries with stationary walls are aside the hydrofoil s midline with distances of 0 096 m the side walls are set as stationary walls as well when pitching at a large angle remeshing is accomplished in order to modify the distorted boundary mesh by combining the settings made in the flow analysis specified on the configuration s general settings tab with a batch run of the ansys icem cfd mesh generator using replay files the specified rotational arc length of the hydrofoil s boundary is θ f ω r t t m x x r 2 y 2 where ω r is the rotational angular velocity that around the rotating center shown in fig 8 t and t m are the total time and the initial time of the remeshing respectively and x r is the horizontal coordinate of the rotating center the trigger condition identifying the orthogonality angle of the distorted mesh is min v a l o r t h o g o n a l i t y a n g l e f l u i d d o m a i n 20 deg the mesh becomes distorted at about 5 fig 10 and then the remeshing process is carried out the remeshed gird seems fine as expected and it is shown in fig 11 the numerical setups are done second the time step and turbulence intensities are 0 01 s and 2 94 respectively the max stagger loops step is set to 50 and the total time is 2 s the γ r eθ transitional model is added in the transient pitching motion simulation which is initialized with the steady state results at 0 the stiffness of the mesh is set to be inversely proportional to the wall distance in order to limit the mesh distortion in the wall region the boundary motion and remeshing method is then used to analyze the hydrodynamic performance of a pitching hydrofoil 3 3 results and discussion the simulation is based on the pitching hydrofoil experiment performed by ducoin and young 2013a b the experimental set up is as follows measurements are carried out in the cavitation tunnel at irenav the test section is 1m long and has a square section of length h 0 192 m the tunnel turbulence intensity at the center of the test section is t u u r m s u 2 94 both rigid and flexible hydrofoils are naca 66 shaped and are mounted horizontally in the tunnel test section fig 12 the hydrofoils can rotate providing a large range of angles of incidence for the hydrofoils the rigid hydrofoil is made of stainless steel e 2 1 1011 pa which is partially cantilevered using a steel cylinder connected to a motor that is used to change the angle of attack and the tip section is free the flexible hydrofoil is made of pom e 3 109 pa chosen in order to significantly increase the level of deformations and vibrations unlike a rigid hydrofoil with a partially fixed boundary condition the flexible hydrofoil is fully clamped at the root whereas the tip section is free pressure measurements along the chord wise direction are carried out using seventeen piezo resistive transducers velocity measurements have been carried out for a nominal velocity u 5 m s corresponding to a reynolds number of re 750000 the velocities are measured on the suction side of the foil using a dantec two component lda system structural vibrations are measured by means of a laser doppler vibrometer polytec psv 400 using a class ii he ne laser the device is equipped with a scanning system that enables vibration measurements over a predefined grid mapped on the vibrating surface in ducoin s research the laminar to turbulent transition occurs at about 6 that deserves further study the hydrodynamic dimensionless coefficients are defined as 9 lift coefficient c l f y 0 5 ρ u 2 s c 10 drag coefficient c d f x 0 5 ρ u 2 s c 11 torque coefficient c m m z 0 5 ρ u 2 s c 2 a n d 12 suction side loading coefficient c l t i 2 10 c p x i c t δ x i c where f x and f y are the horizontal and vertical forces respectively the variables s and c are the chord length and span length respectively c p is the pressure coefficient at location x i c and δ is the dimensionless distance between two consecutive transducers the convergence properties of different models with fluid mesh composed of different chord mesh numbers boundary layer numbers first layer thicknesses up and down mesh numbers total mesh numbers and mesh qualities y y μ τ ν are investigated the combined four types of meshes are shown in table 1 table 2 displays the hydrodynamic performance of models with different types of mesh as the mesh goes gradually tiny from mesh 1 to 4 the steady state hydrodynamic performance becomes convergence using the k ω sst turbulence model with the gradual encryption of the grid under different parameters the c l and c d remain stable and the grid density has little effect on the calculation results when the number of mesh is greater than 2906680 that is to say the difference of hydrodynamic coefficients between mesh 3 and mesh 4 are less than 3 which is within reasonable limits at this point the grid independence is considered to be good so the final stable convergent structured mesh model has a boundary layer number of 50 and a first layer thickness of 0 001 mm making a total mesh number of 7 5 106 and y 1 mesh 4 is then used for further research on the transient simulation the γ r eθ transitional model is added in the transient pitching motion simulation which is initialized with the steady state results at 0 the rotational angular velocity ω r is 6 s the max loops step is set to 50 and the total time is 2 s the time step remesh trigger condition and turbulent intensity are considered to build 5 types of transient models table 3 fig 13 displays the comparison between pressure coefficients at x c 0 3 for different computation models with test results the simulation approaches the test well when the time step is 0 001 s comparing cases 1 to 3 the trigger condition of the 30 mesh orthogonality angle will remesh only several seriously distorted mesh models comparing case 3 with case 4 the model with turbulent intensity of 2 94 simulates the transition time well comparing case 4 with case 5 the transient model of case 5 meets good agreement with the test results the pressure coefficient decreases with a small pitching angle and reaches the laminar to turbulent transitional point at about 5 1 which is close to the experimental transitional angle more flow regimes such as stall and cavitation at a large attack angle will not be analyzed in this paper fig 14 displays the pressure coefficient c p changes with angles of attack at x c 0 2 0 7 0 8 0 9 the agreement with testing shows that the transient model in this section is good at simulating the transient pitching hydrodynamic performance which paves the way for fsi simulation fig 15 displays the velocity streamline changes of the fluid region during hydrofoil pitching the laminar separation bubble lsb occurs near the trailing edge at the initial angle of attack a then the lsb moves toward the leading edge when the angle of attack is increasing the lsb is near the leading edge and the incidental turbulent bubble tb occurs near the trailing edge as the angle of attack approaches 5 1 b showing the laminar to turbulent transition as the angle of attack continues to increase the turbulence continues to develop with the movement of the tb to the leading edge when pitching to 12 as shown in c the large tb and the reversed flow can be clearly seen at the trailing edge indicating the full development of the turbulence the phenomena simulated above agree with ducoin et al 2008 the resultant change of hydrodynamic performance is calculated here in order to compare with the experimental data found by ducoin et al 2009a b the suction side loading coefficient c l t the lift coefficient c l and the drag coefficient c d are shown in fig 16 the c l t coefficient increases with the angle of attack and is close to the experimental value the transition point is at about 5 1 and close to the experimental value the lift and drag coefficients show an incline with the angle of attack thus the steady state and transient simulation of the rigid hydrofoil have helped to establish the computational model which is the foundation of the flexible hydrofoil 4 deformation characteristic of a flexible hydrofoil based on the hydrodynamic performance analysis of a steel hydrofoil the hydrodynamic performance and the static deformation analysis of a flexible hydrofoil are conducted here in order to explore the static fsi simulation method the hydrodynamic simulation setups are based on the rigid hydrofoil mentioned above and coupled with a static fsi the fsi simulation method introduced above is adopted here for the flexible hydrofoil the one way and two way fsi analyses are carried out for the hydrodynamic performance deformation and stress the simulation is initialized with steady state calculations of 0 and the additional coupling sent data is set on the rotating fsi interface the solid body is fully clamped at the root and the mesh of the structure is shown in fig 17 the density young s modulus and poisson s ratio of the pom are ρ 1 48 103 kg m3 e 3 gpa and υ 0 35 respectively during the one way fsi simulation the deformation is not transferred back on the fsi interface the one way and two way fsi lift and drag coefficients are shown in fig 18 the increasing trend with the angle of attack is the same but the difference is that the lift is low and the drag is high for the two way fsi compared to the one way fsi the reason is that the deformation changes the camber of the flexible hydrofoil which becomes a new type of foil with the increase of the angle of attack the difference becomes larger because the forces lead to larger deformation the chord wise pressure distributions of one way fsi at 0 6 and 12 are compared in fig 19 a the horizontal axis is from the leading edge to the trailing edge the pressure distribution profile will change with the increase of the angle of attack the center of pressure which is calculated using the moment of pressure to the leading edge moves toward the leading edge for the two way fsi the tip pressure distribution tends to be higher and the center moves to the leading edge when compared to the one way fsi as shown in fig 19 b and table 4 the change rule is the same as in ducoin and young 2013a b the structural performance is then compared within one way and two way fsi since the total mesh displacement minus the translational boundary motion is the deformation the deformation for the fsi simulation will be calculated based on the cfd post as shown in fig 20 the maximum deformation is larger at every condition of two way fsi compared to one way fsi and two way fsi is closer to the experimental result the phenomenon shows that the two way fsi simulation is necessary and the deformation of the flexible hydrofoil highly influences the flow around the body the deformation is within 2 5 mm under 5 but gradually increases to 4 mm at 12 the deformation and stress contours are shown in fig 21 the deformation is gradually larger and the stress is gradually smaller from the root to the tip the pressure distribution along the chord wise changes and the center of pressure moves toward the leading edge as the angle of attack increases as a result of this the maximum deformation moves from the trailing edge to the leading edge and the maximum stress moves from 0 4345 c to 0 3936 c the coordinate motion of the center of pressure the maximum deformation and the maximum stress shows the bend twist coupling effect of the flexible hydrofoils the tip deformation relative to the span of the flexible hydrofoil is 2 which means that the two way fsi performance has to be considered in the simulation 5 vibration characteristic of a flexible hydrofoil the transient fsi simulation studies the pressure fluctuation and the structural vibration in the frequency domain the transient analysis will provide information for further research on the noise performance therefore the transient fsi simulations are carried out here on the conditions of α 4 and α 8 5 1 pressure fluctuation simulation of transient fsi the fluid fluctuation performance is simulated as the exciting source to the structural vibration the les simulation is initialized with a k ω sst transient analysis in order to compute the pressure fluctuation of the rigid and flexible hydrofoils the time step turns out to be 2 5 10 4 s which can transform to the frequency domain of 2000 hz the transient lifts at 4 and 8 are shown in figs 22 and 23 the data does not perfectly converge due to time consumption but the fluctuations of fsi lift and drag versus the amplitudes are within 4 which can be seen as quasi steady state results the frequency domain of lift is transformed by fft so the data at 0 hz is the mean lift since the flexible hydrofoil is immobile the fluctuation portion is much smaller than the time domain lift the fluctuation tends to be smaller with the increasing frequency from the local pressure spectrograms at the trailing edge in the experiment ducoin and young 2013a b we can see at lower angles than 4 the vortex shedding frequencies are about 400 hz and 600 hz while at higher angles than 6 the pressure spectrums changes to a broadband shape without any particular peak resulting from a fully turbulent boundary layer flow since the lifting force calculated here is the integral of the local pressure load from the leading edge to the trailing edge the first peak frequencies of 96 hz and 78 hz are probably in accordance to the averaged turbulent and vortex shedding frequency the frequencies of 400 hz and 600 hz also appear but small which reflect the vortex shedding of the lsb simulated above the total fluctuation portion at 4 is larger and complicated because the angle at 4 is near the transitional point compared to 8 this may influence the vibration response leading the vibrating velocity at 4 larger than at 8 which will be studied in the future 5 2 structural vibration characteristic simulation of transient fsi the structural vibration characteristic is the basis of the vibration response the structural simulation of the transient fsi is carried out here for the vibration performance of the steel fig 24 and the pom hydrofoil in air and in water the purpose of the steel hydrofoil study is to compare the different modeling method and vibration characteristic reflecting the reduction of pom hydrofoil s natural frequency due to fsi flexibility the added fluid domains in the wet natural frequency calculation are shown in fig 25 a and b the fixed boundary conditions are different between the two hydrofoils the natural frequency and the vibration shape are calculated using the workbench acoustic extension the water around the hydrofoil is set as an acoustic body with ρ 1 0 103 kg m3 e 0 gpa υ 0 the acoustic speed is v w 1483 m s and the reference pressure is p r 1 10 6 pa the interface between the acoustic body and the boundary of the hydrofoil is set as an acoustic fsi interface the algorithm is set as program controlled coupled the modal vibration shapes of the pom hydrofoil are shown in fig 26 the first mode is the bending vibration the second mode is the twisting vibration and the higher modes are the bend twist coupling vibrations with different combinations the second and subsequent shapes are the same as those in the experiment the computational natural frequencies of the pom hydrofoil are listed in table 5 the differences between calculation and experiment are within 5 4 at the first five modes which show good agreement the added mass has a big impact on the wet modal frequency compared to the dry modal frequency as the modal rank increases the wet modal frequency decreases vary from 53 8 at mode 1 29 2 at mode 10 the computational natural frequencies of the steel hydrofoil are listed in table 6 the differences between calculation and experiment are within 2 at the first two modes that should be concerned which show good agreements as the modal rank increases the wet modal frequency decrease varies from 36 9 at mode 7 14 2 at mode 4 the decline of the wet frequency did not gradually vary with the modal rank because of the partially fixed boundary condition of the steel hydrofoil as a result the former two dry modal frequencies of the steel hydrofoil are about 1 7 times than the pom dry modal frequencies which are lower than the expected increase proportional to e ρ 6 conclusions the objective of this paper is to form the static and transient fsi simulation method of a flexible hydrofoil then analyze the deformation and vibration characteristics compared to a steel hydrofoil the fluid and structure models are investigated with theory and equations respectively the fsi simulation method is introduced with theory and illustrated with a flowchart the mesh mapping data transfer and setups are explained for the comparative calculation the hydrodynamic performance analysis of a rigid hydrofoil is carried out first the boundary motion and remeshing method is researched for the simulation of the pitching motion in a cavitation tunnel the parameters of the mesh and setups are compared in order to establish a good model that agree well with the experimental results of the pressure and the suction side loading the lift and the drag coefficients the lsb and turbulent transition are captured numerical flow analysis revealed that the lsb occurs at 0 8 c when pitching at an initial angle of attack as the angle increases to 5 1 the laminar to turbulent transition occurs and the lift presents an inflection the static fsi simulation of the flexible hydrofoil is conducted showing that the lift of the flexible hydrofoil is low and the drag is high for the two way fsi compared to the one way fsi for the two way fsi the tip pressure distribution tends to be higher and the center moves to the leading edge compared to the one way fsi which is the same as that found by ducoin the static deformation is within 2 5 mm under 5 but gradually increases to 4 mm at 12 meaning that the two way fsi performance has to be considered in the simulation the transient fsi simulation of a flexible hydrofoil is carried out on the pressure fluctuation and structural vibration the fluctuation portion of the lift in the frequency domain is much smaller than in the time domain the first peak frequencies are 96 hz and 78 hz at 4 and 8 respectively the fluctuation tends to be smaller with increasing frequency the modal vibration shapes of the pom hydrofoil are calculated showing the first mode of bending the second mode of twisting and the higher mode of bend twist coupling the differences between the calculated wet natural frequencies of the pom hydrofoil and the experiment are within 5 4 at the first five modes which show good agreement as do the results for the steel hydrofoil at the first two modes as the modal rank increases the pom hydrofoil s wet modal frequency decrease varies from 53 8 to 29 2 whereas the steel hydrofoil s wet modal frequency decrease varies from 36 9 to 14 2 the major finding of this paper is that the flexible hydrofoil has different deformation and vibration characteristics compared to steel hydrofoil if a hydrofoil or a marine propeller uses composite material the characteristics above should be considered to evaluate the hydrodynamic and fluid noise performances from our point of view the vibration excited by turbulence exists in the uniform flow and the vibration excited by unsteady hydrodynamic force due to periodic rotation exists in the non uniform flow after the ship the turbulence pressure fluctuation researched in this paper will be taken as the exciting source of the structure frequency load so this paper has laid the foundation for further research on the hydroelastic vibration response and noise in the uniform flow of the

22791,flexible hydrofoils can be regarded as the simplified lifting bodies of composite propellers and these hydrofoils are suitable for use in the study of the fluid structure interaction fsi computational method the hydrodynamic simulation of a rigid cantilevered rectangular hydrofoil is performed first then the boundary rotational motion and remeshing approach are used for the numerical calculation of the hydrofoil s pitching hydrodynamic performance and finally the tunnel boundary effect is perfectly simulated via the steps of structured meshing rotational parameter transforming and remeshing the mesh number boundary layer orthogonality angle and turbulent intensity parameters are obtained through comparisons of various models thus the laminar separation bubble lsb and turbulent transition are captured then the static fsi simulation of the flexible hydrofoil is conducted showing that the lift of the flexible hydrofoil is low and the drag is high for the two way fsi compared to the one way fsi the center of pressure the maximum deformation and the stress move toward the leading edge showing the necessity of the two way fsi calculation the transient fsi simulation of the flexible hydrofoil is then studied using the large eddy simulation les turbulence model to calculate the pressure load which can simulate the turbulence fluctuation as the exciting source of the structural frequency domain load the calculated first peak frequencies are 96 hz and 78 hz at 4 and 8 respectively the modal vibration shapes of the pom hydrofoil are calculated showing the first mode of bending the second mode of twisting and the higher mode of bend twist coupling the calculated wet natural frequencies of the pom hydrofoil and the steel hydrofoil show good agreements with experimental values as the modal rank increases the pom hydrofoil s wet modal frequency decrease varies from 53 8 to 29 2 whereas the steel hydrofoil s wet modal frequency decrease varies from 36 9 to 14 2 keywords fsi flexible hydrofoil deformation vibration characteristic transient 1 introduction the propellers equipped on marine ships are usually made of nickel aluminum bronze and produce thrust without consideration of flexibility recently the manufacturers of composite propellers have become widely concerned with the need for increasing efficiency as well as reducing weight and noise the researches on the bend twist coupling effect and the fluid structure interaction fsi performance are of vital importance to the process of taking advantage of the composite propellers flexibility as well as their anisotropic material properties and high damping vibration characteristics in contrast to traditional metal propellers to avoid the complexities of curvature changing and thickness changing blade geometries the flexible hydrofoils can be employed as the simplified lifting bodies of composite propellers which make them suitable for study using the fsi computational method the study of the hydrodynamic performance of rigid hydrofoils at different angles of attack is fundamental to the research of flexible hydrofoils these hydrodynamic performances including the pressure distribution force and flow regime of a pitching hydrofoil were studied by kinnas and fine 2006 ducoin et al 2008 ducoin et al 2009a b ducoin and young 2013a b huang et al 2013 and huang et al 2015 the phenomena of transition and stall at high angles of attack that caused by viscous effects may lead to fsi vibration when the object is a flexible hydrofoil the fsi is the dominant performance factor since the deformation and vibration are larger than these in metal hydrofoils the fsi deformations that can change the hydrodynamic force include the bend deflection along the span and the twist deflection along the chord the effects of the ply angles material elasticity and laminate thicknesses of a composite laminate were studied by robynne et al 2015 an experimental study on a bend twist coupled hydrofoil was carried out by herath et al 2013 in a separate study the fbg sensors were embedded in the hydrofoils to measure the deformation claire et al 2012 the fsi deformation was then simulated using finite element based fsi another simulation for a flexible hydrofoil replacing the turbomachinery agree very well with the experimental results conducted in a water tunnel campbell and paterson 2011 campbell and paterson 2011 simulated the flow and propulsion performance of rigid and flexible airfoils using the potential flow formulation showing fast convergence and good accuracy abbaspour and najafi 2018 huang et al 2016 and sun and xiong 2012 investigated the fsi performance of flexible propellers using bem and fem the transient fsi is another aspect that takes into account the time dependent deformation which can be seen as a vibration by transformation into frequency domain the experimental and numerical studies on the hydroelastic performances of hydrofoils by ducoin et al 2009a b ducoin and young 2013a b and ducoin et al 2012a b provided a great deal of information including the hydrodynamic deformation and vibration performances of hydrofoils made by steel and polyacetate material young et al 2018 experimentally and numerically studied the bend twist coupling effects by contrasting three composite and one stainless steel hydrofoils showing that the orientation of composite layers significantly affected the vibrating characteristics the hydrodynamic force fluctuations and natural frequencies of six different flexible hydrofoils of similar geometry were studied by zarruk et al 2014 the ply orientation influenced the dependence of the fsi hydrodynamic force and deflections on re the unsteady simulations taking fsi into account were validated with experiments which were carried out in the high speed cavitation tunnel by münch et al 2010 mulcahy et al 2010 and mulcahy 2010 researched the hydrodynamic performance of a cantilevered plate with different skews by applying this method to the fsi analysis of a flexible composite hydrofoil the results showed convergence mulcahy then carried out an analysis of the transient hydroelastic and sound power performance of a flexible propeller blade mulcahy et al 2014 the vibration characteristics of hydrofoils mainly include the natural frequency mode shape and fluid damping the influence of surrounding boundaries and material anisotropy on the vibration characteristics of submerged composite plates was investigated by motley et al 2013 and kramer et al 2013 the influence of skew on the marine propellers added mass and damping matrices was studied by mao and young 2016 the investigations on the role of fsi hydrodynamic damping and added mass effect were reviewed by trivedi 2017 gauthiera et al 2017 numerically simulated flow induced damping on a vibrating hydraulic turbine blade according to akcabay and young 2015 unsteady two phase flows with time varying fluid added mass effects may arouse additional modulated frequencies chae et al 2017 investigated the flow induced bend twist fsi effects wet natural frequencies and damping coefficients using a 2d viscous fsi model for fsi characteristics cavity induced vibration cannot be ignored for the hydroelastic performance of the pitching hydrofoils ducoin et al 2012 akcabay et al 2014 wu et al 2015 investigated the effect of bend twist coupling deformation on the cavitation pattern of rigid and flexible hydrofoils they then researched the association among the flow induced vibration frequency the cavity shedding frequency and the vibration frequencies wu et al 2018 the hydroelastic deformations and vibrations of hydrofoils induced by the turbulence are small but important for fundamental research on fsi because the fluid added mass cannot be ignored due to the flexibility the static and transient fsi simulation methods are illustrated the comparative deformation and vibration characteristics of rigid and flexible hydrofoils are analyzed in this paper based on the experimental results by ducoin et al 2009a b and ducoin and young 2013a b the aim of this paper is to form a simulating method to research the exciting force and the vibration characteristic of a flexible hydrofoil then is the study of the fsi vibration response and fsi noise in the future once the flexibility is considered the static fsi simulation is needed to determine the flexibility and the transient fsi simulation is needed to determine the vibration characteristic 2 numerical model 2 1 fluid model the flows around the pitching hydrofoils can be treated as viscous and incompressible fluids that meet the requirements for the navier stokes equations the cfx software divides the fluid domain solves the mass momentum and energy equations and then computes the pressure distribution and force the fluid simulation includes steady state analysis and transient analysis steady state analysis is a procedure used to calculate the hydrodynamic performance of fixed hydrofoils whereas transient analysis is a procedure used to calculate the time dependent hydrodynamic performance of pitching hydrofoils by solving the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations rans equations contain averaged and time varying fluctuating components to calculate the fluid pressure force of moving bodies using turbulence the turbulent characteristics are the key to simulating the hydrodynamic performance of pitching hydrofoils there are many turbulence models to compute the reynolds stresses which have different computational accuracies for the viscous eddy for different objects or conditions the choice of turbulence model should take into account the prediction accuracy of the boundary flow separation the k ω shear stress transport sst turbulence model simulates the inception and the amount of flow separation under adverse pressure gradients quite well ansys 2016 when pitching at a high angle the transition of laminar flow to turbulent flow occurs where the boundary layer flow separates and the local pressure presents inflexion to accurately simulate the separation induced transition the k ω sst turbulence model is coupled with a transition model γ r eθ the model sets r eθ as the critical reynolds number when the intermittency γ first starts to increase in the boundary layer the transition model is based on two transport equations one is for intermittency γ which triggers the transition process ducoin et al 2009a b 1 ρ γ t ρ u j γ x j p γ e γ x j μ μ t σ γ γ x j where p γ and e γ are the transition sources based on empirical correlations μ and μ t are the dynamic viscosity and turbulence viscosity respectively σ γ is a model constant another equation delineates the transition momentum thickness reynolds number r e θ t 2 ρ r e θ t t ρ u j r e θ t x j p θ t x j σ θ t μ μ t r e θ t x j the source term p θ t is defined as 3 p θ t c θ t ρ t r e θ t r e θ t 1 0 f θ t t 500 μ ρ u 2 where c θ t and σ θ t are model constants f θ t is a source term related to the boundary layer and γ the two transport equations can be utilized by setting the transitional turbulence as gamma theta with a specified γ and r e θ t in this paper the prediction of the transition length is good when γ is equal to 1 0 the analysis method above is used to simulate the time averaged force trend of hydrofoils however when the analysis aims at the fluid force fluctuation of the structure the transient analysis requires small time steps model such as the large eddy simulation les les is an approach that is good at simulating the transient fluctuating lifting force of different hydrofoils yielding good accuracy huang et al 2014 ji et al 2015 chen et al 2017 the les approach solves for large scale fluctuating motions and uses sub grid scale turbulence model for small scale motion ansys 2016 the rationale behind the les technique is a separation between the large and small scales the governing equations for les are obtained by filtering the time dependent n s equations in the physical space the filtering process effectively filters out eddies whose scales are smaller than the filter width or grid spacing the resulting equations thus govern the dynamics of the large eddies 4 ρ t x i ρ u i 0 and 5 t ρ u i x j ρ u i u j x j ν σ i j x j p x i τ i j x j where σ ij is the stress tensor caused by viscous fluid and τ ij denotes the sub grid scale sgs stress computed by smagorinsky lilly model ansys 2016 the sgs model compares dissipation of kinetic energy at sub grid scales to molecular diffusion in this case the separation part of τ i j is modeled as 6 τ i j 1 3 τ k k δ i j 2 μ t s i j where μ t represents the sgs viscosity these approaches require fine grids and small time steps with the values of the k ω sst simulation as initial conditions the frequency dependent pressure force is obtained by using the fourier transform 2 2 structure model the dynamic equation of motion with respect to a fixed solid body can be written as follows young 2007 7 k u c u m u f t where u u and u are the nodal displacement velocity and acceleration vectors respectively k c and m are the structural stiffness damping and mass matrices respectively the static structural analysis is a procedure used to calculate the displacement stress and strain data which are time independent the fsi deformation and stress are obtained with the combination of computational fluid dynamics cfd and computational structure dynamics csd the transient structural analysis is a procedure used to calculate the velocity and acceleration data which are related to inertia and damping the vibration performance of a flexible hydrofoil is studied using the transient csd coupled with the transient cfd the vibration characteristic is then calculated using the modal superposition method the transient displacement vector can be seen as the weighted superposition of every order of modal coordinates using the weight of participation factors the modal coordinates are the general solutions u t x sin ω t φ to the homogeneous equation k u c u m u 0 of the forced dynamic equation and can describe the vibrating shape at every natural frequency the frequency ω is the dry modal frequency ω i in the air condition however taking into account the fsi influence by establishing the fluid domain ω is the wet modal frequency ω i 2 3 fluid structure interaction model the calculation process is conducted on an ansys workbench 16 0 platform by coupling the csd software ansys mechanical and the cfd software cfx through mfx multiple physical field solver the cfx is the dominant base used to control the data transfer iteration output and post processing the fsi procedure is shown in fig 1 during the fsi calculation the total time and time steps are set in cfd and csd simultaneously they are the synchronization points at which the data transfer and the mesh mapping are carried out based on this setup the outer time loop and the inner stagger loop are run in order to solve the fluid model and the structure model unlike the wall boundary set in the hydrodynamic simulation of rigid hydrofoils the mesh motion and mesh deformation are set at the coupling interface in the fsi simulation in order to obtain the motion and deformation of flexible hydrofoils the data transfer is conducted under the premise of mesh mapping between the fluid and structure domains using the multi field mesh motion method the two way fsi analysis is a procedure used to transfer the converged total force in cfd rms residual of 1 10 6 is met or iteration number of 10 is reached and the converged total mesh displacement in csd program controlled in the coupling interface at every coupling time step the total mesh displacement contains the boundary motion and the structure deformation the convergence must be achieved in a stagger loop inside cfd and csd and a time loop at every time step the one way fsi analysis is a procedure used to transfer the converged fluid pressure in cfd to the structure for the calculation of deformation and vibration in csd without feedback the data transfer between the fluid and the structure interfaces is conducted using mesh mapping and interpolation the total mesh displacement transfer is interpolated with the profile preserving interpolation method fig 2 a which is a bucket search arithmetic method that ensures the same total data field while the total force transfer is interpolated with the conservative interpolation method fig 2 b which is a tree search arithmetic method that converts the 3 d surface data to a 2 d control surface and intersects with areas that surround the receiving side node when starting the coupling loop mesh mapping is performed only once to establish the relationship between the structure and the fluid mesh which is the basis of data transfer the mapping will not change with the mesh motion because the mesh node ip has been defined the mesh mapping and the data transfer of the flexible hydrofoil in this paper work well as shown in figs 3 and 4 the process of coupling and data transfer can reveal the fsi mechanism and lay the foundation for the control of the fsi setup in different conditions 3 hydrodynamic simulation of a rigid hydrofoil based on the hydrodynamic performance analysis of a steel hydrofoil the hydrodynamic performance and static deformation analysis of a flexible hydrofoil is conducted in order to explore the fsi calculating method the turbulent characteristic of a rigid hydrofoil is complex which is the basis for further research on the fsi characteristic of a geometric equivalent flexible hydrofoil 3 1 numerical set up for a rigid pitching hydrofoil in the cavitation tunnel experimented on by ducoin et al 2012a b the hydrodynamic performance under the condition of a pitching velocity of 6 s from 0 and a nominal free stream velocity of 5 m s is simulated in this section the hydrofoil is a rectangular cantilevered naca66 foil with a 0 15 m chord length a 0 191m span length and a naca 0 8 camber distribution with a maximum thickness of 0 018 m and a maximum camber of 0 003 m more information about this experiment can be found in ducoin et al 2012a b the modeling of the fluid domain is done first the usual modeling method is a combination of the inner column domain for the hydrofoil s rotation and the outer cube domain for the infinite water the same method as marine propellers however the hydrodynamic performance has a large error when compared with the experimental results since the rotational inner domain needs a wide range of space that does not capture the limit of the wall effect therefore a single cube domain is adopted due to its excellent capture of the wall boundary although this domain has the disadvantage of divergence caused by mesh deformation when pitching at large angle consequently the remeshing strategy has to be investigated here 3 2 boundary motion and remeshing method the specified rotational motion of the hydrofoil is set in cfx to simulate its pitching performance the structured mesh is partitioned with refinement near the boundary layer to separate the fluid domain when pitching at a large angle condition the remeshing process is performed to rebuild a new mesh and start with a new simulation the boundary motion identification and remeshing procedure is shown in fig 5 the first step is geometry modeling and meshing in icem including setting up the block and the mesh seed see fig 5 the c type structural mesh and the association of points and lines with geometry are conducted beforehand in order to make the remesh fine figs 6 and 7 the replay scripts are necessary since the automatic remeshing will be read later the boundary conditions and time steps are set in cfx pre along with the mesh distortion parameter and the rebuild trigger identification as the time step runs the simulation is interrupted at the mesh orthogonality trigger condition and starts with the geometry rebuilding and remeshing using the former scripts the remeshing may occur many times if the mesh is tiny or the pitching angle is large for the pitching hydrofoil the rotational motion parameter association is difficult since the cfx remeshing can only identify the translational motion thus the conversion of the rotation to translation has to be researched through the program fig 8 the center of mass of the rotated hydrofoil in cfx is δx f δy f which will be identified as δx i δy i is shown as 8 δ x δ d cos θ δ y δ d sin θ δ d 2 r sin θ 2 where δ d is the centroid moving distance and θ is the rotated angle the method of boundary motion and remeshing is carried out for the rigid pitching hydrofoil the 3d fluid domain and mesh are shown in fig 9 the inlet boundary with a velocity of u 5 m s is before the leading edge with a distance of 1 c while the outlet boundary with a reference pressure of 0pa is behind the trailing edge with a distance of 2 c the top and bottom boundaries with stationary walls are aside the hydrofoil s midline with distances of 0 096 m the side walls are set as stationary walls as well when pitching at a large angle remeshing is accomplished in order to modify the distorted boundary mesh by combining the settings made in the flow analysis specified on the configuration s general settings tab with a batch run of the ansys icem cfd mesh generator using replay files the specified rotational arc length of the hydrofoil s boundary is θ f ω r t t m x x r 2 y 2 where ω r is the rotational angular velocity that around the rotating center shown in fig 8 t and t m are the total time and the initial time of the remeshing respectively and x r is the horizontal coordinate of the rotating center the trigger condition identifying the orthogonality angle of the distorted mesh is min v a l o r t h o g o n a l i t y a n g l e f l u i d d o m a i n 20 deg the mesh becomes distorted at about 5 fig 10 and then the remeshing process is carried out the remeshed gird seems fine as expected and it is shown in fig 11 the numerical setups are done second the time step and turbulence intensities are 0 01 s and 2 94 respectively the max stagger loops step is set to 50 and the total time is 2 s the γ r eθ transitional model is added in the transient pitching motion simulation which is initialized with the steady state results at 0 the stiffness of the mesh is set to be inversely proportional to the wall distance in order to limit the mesh distortion in the wall region the boundary motion and remeshing method is then used to analyze the hydrodynamic performance of a pitching hydrofoil 3 3 results and discussion the simulation is based on the pitching hydrofoil experiment performed by ducoin and young 2013a b the experimental set up is as follows measurements are carried out in the cavitation tunnel at irenav the test section is 1m long and has a square section of length h 0 192 m the tunnel turbulence intensity at the center of the test section is t u u r m s u 2 94 both rigid and flexible hydrofoils are naca 66 shaped and are mounted horizontally in the tunnel test section fig 12 the hydrofoils can rotate providing a large range of angles of incidence for the hydrofoils the rigid hydrofoil is made of stainless steel e 2 1 1011 pa which is partially cantilevered using a steel cylinder connected to a motor that is used to change the angle of attack and the tip section is free the flexible hydrofoil is made of pom e 3 109 pa chosen in order to significantly increase the level of deformations and vibrations unlike a rigid hydrofoil with a partially fixed boundary condition the flexible hydrofoil is fully clamped at the root whereas the tip section is free pressure measurements along the chord wise direction are carried out using seventeen piezo resistive transducers velocity measurements have been carried out for a nominal velocity u 5 m s corresponding to a reynolds number of re 750000 the velocities are measured on the suction side of the foil using a dantec two component lda system structural vibrations are measured by means of a laser doppler vibrometer polytec psv 400 using a class ii he ne laser the device is equipped with a scanning system that enables vibration measurements over a predefined grid mapped on the vibrating surface in ducoin s research the laminar to turbulent transition occurs at about 6 that deserves further study the hydrodynamic dimensionless coefficients are defined as 9 lift coefficient c l f y 0 5 ρ u 2 s c 10 drag coefficient c d f x 0 5 ρ u 2 s c 11 torque coefficient c m m z 0 5 ρ u 2 s c 2 a n d 12 suction side loading coefficient c l t i 2 10 c p x i c t δ x i c where f x and f y are the horizontal and vertical forces respectively the variables s and c are the chord length and span length respectively c p is the pressure coefficient at location x i c and δ is the dimensionless distance between two consecutive transducers the convergence properties of different models with fluid mesh composed of different chord mesh numbers boundary layer numbers first layer thicknesses up and down mesh numbers total mesh numbers and mesh qualities y y μ τ ν are investigated the combined four types of meshes are shown in table 1 table 2 displays the hydrodynamic performance of models with different types of mesh as the mesh goes gradually tiny from mesh 1 to 4 the steady state hydrodynamic performance becomes convergence using the k ω sst turbulence model with the gradual encryption of the grid under different parameters the c l and c d remain stable and the grid density has little effect on the calculation results when the number of mesh is greater than 2906680 that is to say the difference of hydrodynamic coefficients between mesh 3 and mesh 4 are less than 3 which is within reasonable limits at this point the grid independence is considered to be good so the final stable convergent structured mesh model has a boundary layer number of 50 and a first layer thickness of 0 001 mm making a total mesh number of 7 5 106 and y 1 mesh 4 is then used for further research on the transient simulation the γ r eθ transitional model is added in the transient pitching motion simulation which is initialized with the steady state results at 0 the rotational angular velocity ω r is 6 s the max loops step is set to 50 and the total time is 2 s the time step remesh trigger condition and turbulent intensity are considered to build 5 types of transient models table 3 fig 13 displays the comparison between pressure coefficients at x c 0 3 for different computation models with test results the simulation approaches the test well when the time step is 0 001 s comparing cases 1 to 3 the trigger condition of the 30 mesh orthogonality angle will remesh only several seriously distorted mesh models comparing case 3 with case 4 the model with turbulent intensity of 2 94 simulates the transition time well comparing case 4 with case 5 the transient model of case 5 meets good agreement with the test results the pressure coefficient decreases with a small pitching angle and reaches the laminar to turbulent transitional point at about 5 1 which is close to the experimental transitional angle more flow regimes such as stall and cavitation at a large attack angle will not be analyzed in this paper fig 14 displays the pressure coefficient c p changes with angles of attack at x c 0 2 0 7 0 8 0 9 the agreement with testing shows that the transient model in this section is good at simulating the transient pitching hydrodynamic performance which paves the way for fsi simulation fig 15 displays the velocity streamline changes of the fluid region during hydrofoil pitching the laminar separation bubble lsb occurs near the trailing edge at the initial angle of attack a then the lsb moves toward the leading edge when the angle of attack is increasing the lsb is near the leading edge and the incidental turbulent bubble tb occurs near the trailing edge as the angle of attack approaches 5 1 b showing the laminar to turbulent transition as the angle of attack continues to increase the turbulence continues to develop with the movement of the tb to the leading edge when pitching to 12 as shown in c the large tb and the reversed flow can be clearly seen at the trailing edge indicating the full development of the turbulence the phenomena simulated above agree with ducoin et al 2008 the resultant change of hydrodynamic performance is calculated here in order to compare with the experimental data found by ducoin et al 2009a b the suction side loading coefficient c l t the lift coefficient c l and the drag coefficient c d are shown in fig 16 the c l t coefficient increases with the angle of attack and is close to the experimental value the transition point is at about 5 1 and close to the experimental value the lift and drag coefficients show an incline with the angle of attack thus the steady state and transient simulation of the rigid hydrofoil have helped to establish the computational model which is the foundation of the flexible hydrofoil 4 deformation characteristic of a flexible hydrofoil based on the hydrodynamic performance analysis of a steel hydrofoil the hydrodynamic performance and the static deformation analysis of a flexible hydrofoil are conducted here in order to explore the static fsi simulation method the hydrodynamic simulation setups are based on the rigid hydrofoil mentioned above and coupled with a static fsi the fsi simulation method introduced above is adopted here for the flexible hydrofoil the one way and two way fsi analyses are carried out for the hydrodynamic performance deformation and stress the simulation is initialized with steady state calculations of 0 and the additional coupling sent data is set on the rotating fsi interface the solid body is fully clamped at the root and the mesh of the structure is shown in fig 17 the density young s modulus and poisson s ratio of the pom are ρ 1 48 103 kg m3 e 3 gpa and υ 0 35 respectively during the one way fsi simulation the deformation is not transferred back on the fsi interface the one way and two way fsi lift and drag coefficients are shown in fig 18 the increasing trend with the angle of attack is the same but the difference is that the lift is low and the drag is high for the two way fsi compared to the one way fsi the reason is that the deformation changes the camber of the flexible hydrofoil which becomes a new type of foil with the increase of the angle of attack the difference becomes larger because the forces lead to larger deformation the chord wise pressure distributions of one way fsi at 0 6 and 12 are compared in fig 19 a the horizontal axis is from the leading edge to the trailing edge the pressure distribution profile will change with the increase of the angle of attack the center of pressure which is calculated using the moment of pressure to the leading edge moves toward the leading edge for the two way fsi the tip pressure distribution tends to be higher and the center moves to the leading edge when compared to the one way fsi as shown in fig 19 b and table 4 the change rule is the same as in ducoin and young 2013a b the structural performance is then compared within one way and two way fsi since the total mesh displacement minus the translational boundary motion is the deformation the deformation for the fsi simulation will be calculated based on the cfd post as shown in fig 20 the maximum deformation is larger at every condition of two way fsi compared to one way fsi and two way fsi is closer to the experimental result the phenomenon shows that the two way fsi simulation is necessary and the deformation of the flexible hydrofoil highly influences the flow around the body the deformation is within 2 5 mm under 5 but gradually increases to 4 mm at 12 the deformation and stress contours are shown in fig 21 the deformation is gradually larger and the stress is gradually smaller from the root to the tip the pressure distribution along the chord wise changes and the center of pressure moves toward the leading edge as the angle of attack increases as a result of this the maximum deformation moves from the trailing edge to the leading edge and the maximum stress moves from 0 4345 c to 0 3936 c the coordinate motion of the center of pressure the maximum deformation and the maximum stress shows the bend twist coupling effect of the flexible hydrofoils the tip deformation relative to the span of the flexible hydrofoil is 2 which means that the two way fsi performance has to be considered in the simulation 5 vibration characteristic of a flexible hydrofoil the transient fsi simulation studies the pressure fluctuation and the structural vibration in the frequency domain the transient analysis will provide information for further research on the noise performance therefore the transient fsi simulations are carried out here on the conditions of α 4 and α 8 5 1 pressure fluctuation simulation of transient fsi the fluid fluctuation performance is simulated as the exciting source to the structural vibration the les simulation is initialized with a k ω sst transient analysis in order to compute the pressure fluctuation of the rigid and flexible hydrofoils the time step turns out to be 2 5 10 4 s which can transform to the frequency domain of 2000 hz the transient lifts at 4 and 8 are shown in figs 22 and 23 the data does not perfectly converge due to time consumption but the fluctuations of fsi lift and drag versus the amplitudes are within 4 which can be seen as quasi steady state results the frequency domain of lift is transformed by fft so the data at 0 hz is the mean lift since the flexible hydrofoil is immobile the fluctuation portion is much smaller than the time domain lift the fluctuation tends to be smaller with the increasing frequency from the local pressure spectrograms at the trailing edge in the experiment ducoin and young 2013a b we can see at lower angles than 4 the vortex shedding frequencies are about 400 hz and 600 hz while at higher angles than 6 the pressure spectrums changes to a broadband shape without any particular peak resulting from a fully turbulent boundary layer flow since the lifting force calculated here is the integral of the local pressure load from the leading edge to the trailing edge the first peak frequencies of 96 hz and 78 hz are probably in accordance to the averaged turbulent and vortex shedding frequency the frequencies of 400 hz and 600 hz also appear but small which reflect the vortex shedding of the lsb simulated above the total fluctuation portion at 4 is larger and complicated because the angle at 4 is near the transitional point compared to 8 this may influence the vibration response leading the vibrating velocity at 4 larger than at 8 which will be studied in the future 5 2 structural vibration characteristic simulation of transient fsi the structural vibration characteristic is the basis of the vibration response the structural simulation of the transient fsi is carried out here for the vibration performance of the steel fig 24 and the pom hydrofoil in air and in water the purpose of the steel hydrofoil study is to compare the different modeling method and vibration characteristic reflecting the reduction of pom hydrofoil s natural frequency due to fsi flexibility the added fluid domains in the wet natural frequency calculation are shown in fig 25 a and b the fixed boundary conditions are different between the two hydrofoils the natural frequency and the vibration shape are calculated using the workbench acoustic extension the water around the hydrofoil is set as an acoustic body with ρ 1 0 103 kg m3 e 0 gpa υ 0 the acoustic speed is v w 1483 m s and the reference pressure is p r 1 10 6 pa the interface between the acoustic body and the boundary of the hydrofoil is set as an acoustic fsi interface the algorithm is set as program controlled coupled the modal vibration shapes of the pom hydrofoil are shown in fig 26 the first mode is the bending vibration the second mode is the twisting vibration and the higher modes are the bend twist coupling vibrations with different combinations the second and subsequent shapes are the same as those in the experiment the computational natural frequencies of the pom hydrofoil are listed in table 5 the differences between calculation and experiment are within 5 4 at the first five modes which show good agreement the added mass has a big impact on the wet modal frequency compared to the dry modal frequency as the modal rank increases the wet modal frequency decreases vary from 53 8 at mode 1 29 2 at mode 10 the computational natural frequencies of the steel hydrofoil are listed in table 6 the differences between calculation and experiment are within 2 at the first two modes that should be concerned which show good agreements as the modal rank increases the wet modal frequency decrease varies from 36 9 at mode 7 14 2 at mode 4 the decline of the wet frequency did not gradually vary with the modal rank because of the partially fixed boundary condition of the steel hydrofoil as a result the former two dry modal frequencies of the steel hydrofoil are about 1 7 times than the pom dry modal frequencies which are lower than the expected increase proportional to e ρ 6 conclusions the objective of this paper is to form the static and transient fsi simulation method of a flexible hydrofoil then analyze the deformation and vibration characteristics compared to a steel hydrofoil the fluid and structure models are investigated with theory and equations respectively the fsi simulation method is introduced with theory and illustrated with a flowchart the mesh mapping data transfer and setups are explained for the comparative calculation the hydrodynamic performance analysis of a rigid hydrofoil is carried out first the boundary motion and remeshing method is researched for the simulation of the pitching motion in a cavitation tunnel the parameters of the mesh and setups are compared in order to establish a good model that agree well with the experimental results of the pressure and the suction side loading the lift and the drag coefficients the lsb and turbulent transition are captured numerical flow analysis revealed that the lsb occurs at 0 8 c when pitching at an initial angle of attack as the angle increases to 5 1 the laminar to turbulent transition occurs and the lift presents an inflection the static fsi simulation of the flexible hydrofoil is conducted showing that the lift of the flexible hydrofoil is low and the drag is high for the two way fsi compared to the one way fsi for the two way fsi the tip pressure distribution tends to be higher and the center moves to the leading edge compared to the one way fsi which is the same as that found by ducoin the static deformation is within 2 5 mm under 5 but gradually increases to 4 mm at 12 meaning that the two way fsi performance has to be considered in the simulation the transient fsi simulation of a flexible hydrofoil is carried out on the pressure fluctuation and structural vibration the fluctuation portion of the lift in the frequency domain is much smaller than in the time domain the first peak frequencies are 96 hz and 78 hz at 4 and 8 respectively the fluctuation tends to be smaller with increasing frequency the modal vibration shapes of the pom hydrofoil are calculated showing the first mode of bending the second mode of twisting and the higher mode of bend twist coupling the differences between the calculated wet natural frequencies of the pom hydrofoil and the experiment are within 5 4 at the first five modes which show good agreement as do the results for the steel hydrofoil at the first two modes as the modal rank increases the pom hydrofoil s wet modal frequency decrease varies from 53 8 to 29 2 whereas the steel hydrofoil s wet modal frequency decrease varies from 36 9 to 14 2 the major finding of this paper is that the flexible hydrofoil has different deformation and vibration characteristics compared to steel hydrofoil if a hydrofoil or a marine propeller uses composite material the characteristics above should be considered to evaluate the hydrodynamic and fluid noise performances from our point of view the vibration excited by turbulence exists in the uniform flow and the vibration excited by unsteady hydrodynamic force due to periodic rotation exists in the non uniform flow after the ship the turbulence pressure fluctuation researched in this paper will be taken as the exciting source of the structure frequency load so this paper has laid the foundation for further research on the hydroelastic vibration response and noise in the uniform flow of the

2016 and the fiji islands sharma and ahmed 2016 china is also rich in wind and wave power and has become the largest offshore wind power generating country in the world wind and wave power account for 45 1 of new energy generation in china li et al 2013 the great improvement in wind power capacity is due to the government policies liao 2016 several universities and research institutions in china have studied wave energy liang et al 2013 wan et al 2015 wang et al 2016a b wu et al 2013 and have adopted the two parameter lognormal logistic and weibull functions to evaluate the wind energy potential resources using observed data in the inner mongolia region of china during 2009 2011 according to the two parameter weibull distribution the wind power density characteristics were calculated by chang et al 2015 the results also suggest that the wind energy potential east of the taiwan strait will be slightly greater in the future a comprehensive system was developed jiang et al 2015 to measure the wind energy potential at two locations in xilin gol league and two other locations in alxa league in the inner mongolia region of china besides in the chengde region the effectiveness of the modified joint models was studied using the hourly averaged wind speed series measured at the three wind turbine sites xiao et al 2015 there are also earlier studies of surface waves in the yellow sea and the east china sea he and xu 2016 calculated the 15 year 1988 2002 long term wind wave hindcast in the yellow sea and analyzed the regional wave climate wu et al 2014 researched historical wave height trends in the south china sea and the east china sea from 1911 to 2010 using ecmwf wave data li et al 2016 estimated the mean and extreme waves in the east china sea by 35 year hindcast wave data that were derived from the wamc4 wave model the analysis of the wave climate in the east china sea has also been performed by wang et al 2016a b using the ecmwf wave data however there is a lack of wind and wave power studies that focus on the yangtze river delta the yangtze river delta is located in eastern china and connects with the yellow sea and east china sea fig 1 as the largest economic zone in china and an international gateway in the asia pacific the wind and wave characteristics and resource assessment for the yangtze river delta will be very valuable therefore we have used the high resolution numerical models to accurately estimate the wind and wave hindcasts from 1981 to 2015 to increase the understanding of the ocean conditions in the yangtze river delta we have achieved this goal by evaluating the mean wind and wave power density and their seasonal and monthly distributions this paper consists of 5 main sections section 1 is introduction section 2 introduces the methods of simulating the wind and wave power density over the yangtze river delta section 3 introduces the numerical model for simulating the wind and waves as well as the validated hindcast data section 4 presents the results and discussion and section 5 gives the summary and conclusions 2 simulation methods of energy density 2 1 simulation methods of wind energy the energy of wind motion can be expressed as the energy of air passing through the section vertically at a given wind speed 1 e k 1 2 m v 2 where e k is the energy of wind motion m is the mass of air and v is the wind speed in addition the mass of air can be calculated as the product of the air density and the volume of air passing through the section over a period of time thus e k can be expressed as 2 e k 1 2 ρ a v t v 2 1 2 ρ a v 3 t where ρ is the air density a is the sectional area and t is the period because of the cubic relation the wind speed obviously plays an important role therefore wind power could be defined as 3 p v 1 2 ρ a v 3 the above equation shows that the wind power density depends largely on the air density and wind speed therefore the wind power density is defined as 4 p d ρ v 1 2 ρ v 3 here the air density of the sea surface is 1 292 kg m3 in the yangtze river delta 2 2 wave energy simulation methods the random wave conditions could be expressed by the directional wave energy spectrum e σ θ as follows 5 j ρ g 0 2 π 0 c g e σ θ d σ d θ where ρ is the seawater density g is the gravitational acceleration c g is the group velocity σ is the relative frequency and θ is the wave direction in the deep water region the wave energy potential can also be expressed in per unit width as tucker and pitt 2001 6 j ρ g 2 64 π t e h s 2 where t e is the significant period and h s is the significant wave height furthermore h s and t e can be determined by the spectral moments function 7 m n 0 2 π 0 ω n e ω θ d ω d θ in which e ω θ is the variance density spectrum and ω is the absolute radian frequency in terms of the doppler shifted dispersion relation therefore the t e and h s wave conditions can be expressed as 8 h s 4 m 0 9 and t e m 1 m 0 3 model description and hindcast configuration 3 1 wind model description wind fields play a significant role in generating waves a suitable simulation of the wind field is a precondition of wave hindcasting in this paper we selected the mesoscale forecasting model and assimilation system wrf model for wind field simulation the procedure combines the numerical weather forecast data assimilation and atmosphere simulation with the arakawa c grid which could advance the forecast and simulation of mesoscale weather in addition this model includes both the physical and dynamic processes of climate change and an atmosphere radiation mode which considers the shortwave and longwave radiation scheme clouds and ground surface layer considering the vertical direction the definition of η is 10 η p h p h t μ where μ p h s p h t p hs and p ht are pressures the euler form equation is 11 u t v u μ d α p x α α d η p η φ x f u 12 v t v v μ d α p y α α d η p η φ y f v 13 w t v w g α α d p η μ d f w 14 θ t v θ f θ 15 μ t v 0 16 φ

force w is the vertical wind vector θ is the potential temperature π is the total exner function and q m is the specific humidity 3 2 wind model setup and validation in this study the wrf model is run each hour with the vertical spatial resolution divided into 16 layers and the horizontal spatial resolution of 0 1 by 0 1 the lateral boundary definition used the ysu scheme in this paper we selected the national center for environmental prediction ncep data for the background fields whose spatial resolution is 0 25 by 0 25 and was recorded every 6 h the research area covers approximately 15 longitude from 116 e to 131 e and 18 latitude from 23 n to 41 n and includes the bohai sea yellow sea and east china sea fig 1 the grid resolution is set as 0 1 by 0 1 the wrf model has several physical options for example sea land surface processes and short wave radiation the physical processes considered in this paper are shown in table 1 the measured wind speed series from buoy 22001 are used for wind validation fig 1a fig 3 gives 9 typhoon wind time series compared with the simulations which show that the wind parameters simulated by the wrf model are in good agreement with the observed wind speed fig 2 gives the tracks of the typhoon processes and the location of the observed stations 3 3 wave model description this paper uses the swan spectral wave model to complete the wave estimation this model which is considered a numerical wave model can provide realistic simulations of wave parameters in coastal areas lakes and estuaries according to the given wind bottom and current conditions the swan model is a third generation full spectral model booij et al 1999 whose theoretical background was proposed by holthuijsen et al 1993 ris et al 1999 the swan model uses action density n σ θ instead of variance density e σ θ to calculate the development of a sea state because the current action density is more conserved than the variance density the action density equals to the variance density divided by the relative frequency and the expression is 18 n σ θ e σ θ σ where θ is the wave direction and σ is the relative frequency the spectral action balance equation describes the wave spectrum evolution and this equation in cartesian coordinates can be written as 19 n t x c x n y c y n σ c σ n θ c θ n s σ the first term of the equation on the left side is the local change rate of action density of time the second term refers to the propagation in the x direction with propagation velocities c x and the third term is same as the second term but in the y direction the fourth term is the shifting of the relative frequency caused by the change of currents and water depths with propagation velocity c σ the last term refers to the refraction of currents and water depths with propagation velocity c θ which is derived from linear wave theory s is the source term which represents the impacts of dissipation wind generation and non linear wave wave interactions the main components of dissipation are bottom friction white capping and wave breaking due to the changing depth 3 4 wave model setup and validation the research domain for the wave model is the same as that of the wind model which has been described in section 3 2 the number of directions of the wave model is 36 the frequency range is from 0 04 hz to 1 hz which covers the typical range of surface wave periods from 1 s to 25 s the calculations were carried out with a time step of 20 min in the non stationary mode and the output time step was set to 1 h the large grid rang is 116 e 131 e and 23 n 41 n with resolution 0 1 by 0 1 the range of emphasis sea area near of yangtze river delta is 119 e 125 e and 27 n 34 n using 1 min grid resolution the hindcast wave parameters are stored in the data set in the time series of 1 h length on the grid during each year from 1981 to 2015 which is a total of 35 years the output parameters of the swan model are the significant wave heights h s mean wave directions and spectral mean periods t m01 based on the moments m 0 and m 1 the zero up crossing period which is approximately equal to t m02 in the narrow band the energy period t e which is also recorded as the spectral period t m 10 based on the spectral moments m 0 and m 1 the normalized frequency width of the spectrum and the directional spreading of the waves the wave power density was estimated based on the spatial records of h s and t e the observation station is used to validate the wind field fig 1 shows the simulations of buoy 22001 which is located in the east china sea from fig 4 we can see that the values of the simulated significant wave heights are in great agreement with the observation data furthermore the buoy located in the yangtze river delta is also verified and the results are shown in fig 5 which show great agreement between the simulation data and observation data this finding indicates that in general the swan model can estimate the wave parameters around the yangtze river delta well 4 results and discussions 4 1 annual wind and wave energy estimation the 35 year database simulated by the wrf model that was introduced in section 2 was used to evaluate the spatial patterns of wind climate the annual spatial patterns of wind speeds significant wave heights and their power density are shown in fig 6 it is obvious from fig 6 that the wind power density is smaller near the coast mostly because of the dissipation near the land in the current calculation the wind speed and wind energy in the southeast is larger than those in the northwest it is observed that wind speeds mostly range from 6 to 7 6 m s and the wind power density mostly ranges from 200 to 440 w m2 the largest wind speed which exceeds 7 6 m s appears in the south the largest average wind power density also appears in the south and is generally more than 440 w m2 in addition we select a 35 year data base generated by the swan model to obtain the spatial patterns of wave climate the annual averaged wave parameters h s and p of every point are obtained to get the spatial distribution maps fig 5 shows the mean annual spatial distribution of the significant wave heights and wave power density fig 7 presents that the wave power is lower near the coasts than the wave power offshore the reason might be that the wave power is dissipated when the water depth becomes shallow according to the present study the significant wave height and wave power is large in the southeast and small in the northwest this finding is because the sea area in the se is influenced more by typhoons than the sea air in the nw since typhoons originate from the northwest pacific significant wave heights of 0 1 5 m and wave power capacities of 0 14 kw m are observed in most sea areas the largest significant wave height of more than 1 5 m occurs in the se where the largest average wave power potential also occurs with more than 14 kw m 4 2 monthly wind and wave energy estimation the characteristics of wind and waves as well as their power density are dependent on weather conditions therefore we select the mean field of each month across 35 years to calculate the mean monthly wind and wave distributions the mean monthly distributions of wind speeds are presented in fig 8 the lowest wind speeds occur in may while the largest wind speeds 9 m s occur in december the mean monthly distributions of wind power density are shown in fig 9 the distributions are similar to the wind fields in that the lowest value appears in may while the largest wind energy potential 700 w m2 appears in december besides the wind speeds and power potential in the southwest yangtze river delta are both maximum during the year fig 10 shows the mean monthly distributions of significant wave heights for twelve months while fig 11 shows the mean monthly distributions of wave power density for twelve months it is clear from the figures that the largest monthly mean significant wave heights appear in december while the largest monthly mean wave power occurs in august this finding is because typhoons often occur in the summer and the wave period is largely influenced by the swell wave the smallest value of the monthly mean significant wave height and wave power both occur in may because of the dry monsoon and summer monsoon changes in the spring 4 3 statistical analysis of the wind and wave parameters fig 12 a and fig 12 b illustrate the wind speeds and energy potential roses respectively according to the 35 year simulated parameters at 6 points fig 1 from the figures it can be seen that the directions nnw n and nne play important roles at most points the direction n is the dominant direction at p1 and p2 while the dominant direction at p4 p5 and p6 is nne the frequency of n and nne is almost the same at p3 on the other hand the frequencies of s ssw and sw are also very high with the influence of summer monsoons to evaluate the directional distributions of significant wave heights and wave power density fig 13 a and fig 13 b show the roses of significant wave heights and roses of wave energy density respectively according to 35 year hindcast data at 6 points fig 1 at point 1 nne is the dominant wave direction with a frequency greater than 15 the roses are similar at point 2 and point 3 as the n wave is the dominant wave the nnw and nne waves also play significant roles during the year the dominant wave direction is n at point 4 nne at point 5 and ne at point 6 however the ssw is also important at these 3 points because of the location and distribution of isobaths the combined scatter and energy diagrams in fig 14 present the wave energy resources in terms of wave heights and periods at the 6 points the charts express the various states of the variation of ocean conditions from the significant wave heights and energy periods and the contribution of the ocean parameters to the mean annual energy the average of the 35 year data the areas in the diagrams are separated by virtual squares with dimensions of 1 m and 1 s the number of each square indicates the presence in hours of the ocean conditions whose significant wave heights and energy periods fall into corresponding ranges the small values at the top of the figures represent the low probability of extremely large waves these values reflect that the majority of wave energy is from the contribution of significant wave heights that range from 0 m to 8 m and energy periods that range from 2 s to 12 s in addition the most of the wave energy is from the contribution of significant wave heights that range from 1 m to 4 m and the energy periods that range from 5 s to 9 s around the yangtze river delta 5 conclusions this paper states an evaluation of the wind and wave energy resources around the yangtze river delta wave fields are continuously simulated by the swan model during the period of 1981 2015 with the simulated wind field input from wrf the simulated parameters are in good agreement with observations the results illustrate that the winds southeast of the yangtze river delta are larger than those northwest furthermore the offshore waves are obviously larger than nearshore waves with an average wave power density of up to 14 kw m the average wind and wave power densities possess the lowest values in spring and become increasingly higher in other seasons specifically the dominant wind directions are nnw n and nne and the s ssw and sw winds also play significant roles around the yangtze river delta the dominant wave directions around the yangtze river delta are n nne and ne the large values of wave energy are from the contribution of significant wave heights that range from 1 m to 4 m and energy periods that range from 5 s to 9 s in summary the study adds to the database of wind and wave properties around the yangtze river delta and provides reliable and valuable information of wind and waves

introduction due to climate change and the diminishing fossil fuel resource renewable energy such as solar wind and wave energy are good options for the future widén et al 2014 as an alternative source of energy with minimum environmental impact wind and waves can provide a substantial source of renewable energy leijon et al 2003 clément et al 2002 wind and wave energy resources have been evaluated by numerical models with reanalysis of the datasets at a global scale capps and zender 2010 and across different regions in europe karamanis et al 2011 shipkovs et al 2013 carvalho et al

2016 and the fiji islands sharma and ahmed 2016 china is also rich in wind and wave power and has become the largest offshore wind power generating country in the world wind and wave power account for 45 1 of new energy generation in china li et al 2013 the great improvement in wind power capacity is due to the government policies liao 2016 several universities and research institutions in china have studied wave energy liang et al 2013 wan et al 2015 wang et al 2016a b wu et al 2013 and have adopted the two parameter lognormal logistic and weibull functions to evaluate the wind energy potential resources using observed data in the inner mongolia region of china during 2009 2011 according to the two parameter weibull distribution the wind power density characteristics were calculated by chang et al 2015 the results also suggest that the wind energy potential east of the taiwan strait will be slightly greater in the future a comprehensive system was developed jiang et al 2015 to measure the wind energy potential at two locations in xilin gol league and two other locations in alxa league in the inner mongolia region of china besides in the chengde region the effectiveness of the modified joint models was studied using the hourly averaged wind speed series measured at the three wind turbine sites xiao et al 2015 there are also earlier studies of surface waves in the yellow sea and the east china sea he and xu 2016 calculated the 15 year 1988 2002 long term wind wave hindcast in the yellow sea and analyzed the regional wave climate wu et al 2014 researched historical wave height trends in the south china sea and the east china sea from 1911 to 2010 using ecmwf wave data li et al 2016 estimated the mean and extreme waves in the east china sea by 35 year hindcast wave data that were derived from the wamc4 wave model the analysis of the wave climate in the east china sea has also been performed by wang et al 2016a b using the ecmwf wave data however there is a lack of wind and wave power studies that focus on the yangtze river delta the yangtze river delta is located in eastern china and connects with the yellow sea and east china sea fig 1 as the largest economic zone in china and an international gateway in the asia pacific the wind and wave characteristics and resource assessment for the yangtze river delta will be very valuable therefore we have used the high resolution numerical models to accurately estimate the wind and wave hindcasts from 1981 to 2015 to increase the understanding of the ocean conditions in the yangtze river delta we have achieved this goal by evaluating the mean wind and wave power density and their seasonal and monthly distributions this paper consists of 5 main sections section 1 is introduction section 2 introduces the methods of simulating the wind and wave power density over the yangtze river delta section 3 introduces the numerical model for simulating the wind and waves as well as the validated hindcast data section 4 presents the results and discussion and section 5 gives the summary and conclusions 2 simulation methods of energy density 2 1 simulation methods of wind energy the energy of wind motion can be expressed as the energy of air passing through the section vertically at a given wind speed 1 e k 1 2 m v 2 where e k is the energy of wind motion m is the mass of air and v is the wind speed in addition the mass of air can be calculated as the product of the air density and the volume of air passing through the section over a period of time thus e k can be expressed as 2 e k 1 2 ρ a v t v 2 1 2 ρ a v 3 t where ρ is the air density a is the sectional area and t is the period because of the cubic relation the wind speed obviously plays an important role therefore wind power could be defined as 3 p v 1 2 ρ a v 3 the above equation shows that the wind power density depends largely on the air density and wind speed therefore the wind power density is defined as 4 p d ρ v 1 2 ρ v 3 here the air density of the sea surface is 1 292 kg m3 in the yangtze river delta 2 2 wave energy simulation methods the random wave conditions could be expressed by the directional wave energy spectrum e σ θ as follows 5 j ρ g 0 2 π 0 c g e σ θ d σ d θ where ρ is the seawater density g is the gravitational acceleration c g is the group velocity σ is the relative frequency and θ is the wave direction in the deep water region the wave energy potential can also be expressed in per unit width as tucker and pitt 2001 6 j ρ g 2 64 π t e h s 2 where t e is the significant period and h s is the significant wave height furthermore h s and t e can be determined by the spectral moments function 7 m n 0 2 π 0 ω n e ω θ d ω d θ in which e ω θ is the variance density spectrum and ω is the absolute radian frequency in terms of the doppler shifted dispersion relation therefore the t e and h s wave conditions can be expressed as 8 h s 4 m 0 9 and t e m 1 m 0 3 model description and hindcast configuration 3 1 wind model description wind fields play a significant role in generating waves a suitable simulation of the wind field is a precondition of wave hindcasting in this paper we selected the mesoscale forecasting model and assimilation system wrf model for wind field simulation the procedure combines the numerical weather forecast data assimilation and atmosphere simulation with the arakawa c grid which could advance the forecast and simulation of mesoscale weather in addition this model includes both the physical and dynamic processes of climate change and an atmosphere radiation mode which considers the shortwave and longwave radiation scheme clouds and ground surface layer considering the vertical direction the definition of η is 10 η p h p h t μ where μ p h s p h t p hs and p ht are pressures the euler form equation is 11 u t v u μ d α p x α α d η p η φ x f u 12 v t v v μ d α p y α α d η p η φ y f v 13 w t v w g α α d p η μ d f w 14 θ t v θ f θ 15 μ t v 0 16 φ t 1 μ v φ g w 0 17 q m t v q m f q m in which u is the zonal wind vector and v is the meridional wind vector μ is the friction coefficient g is the gravity coefficient φ is potential f is external force w is the vertical wind vector θ is the potential temperature π is the total exner function and q m is the specific humidity 3 2 wind model setup and validation in this study the wrf model is run each hour with the vertical spatial resolution divided into 16 layers and the horizontal spatial resolution of 0 1 by 0 1 the lateral boundary definition used the ysu scheme in this paper we selected the national center for environmental prediction ncep data for the background fields whose spatial resolution is 0 25 by 0 25 and was recorded every 6 h the research area covers approximately 15 longitude from 116 e to 131 e and 18 latitude from 23 n to 41 n and includes the bohai sea yellow sea and east china sea fig 1 the grid resolution is set as 0 1 by 0 1 the wrf model has several physical options for example sea land surface processes and short wave radiation the physical processes considered in this paper are shown in table 1 the measured wind speed series from buoy 22001 are used for wind validation fig 1a fig 3 gives 9 typhoon wind time series compared with the simulations which show that the wind parameters simulated by the wrf model are in good agreement with the observed wind speed fig 2 gives the tracks of the typhoon processes and the location of the observed stations 3 3 wave model description this paper uses the swan spectral wave model to complete the wave estimation this model which is considered a numerical wave model can provide realistic simulations of wave parameters in coastal areas lakes and estuaries according to the given wind bottom and current conditions the swan model is a third generation full spectral model booij et al 1999 whose theoretical background was proposed by holthuijsen et al 1993 ris et al 1999 the swan model uses action density n σ θ instead of variance density e σ θ to calculate the development of a sea state because the current action density is more conserved than the variance density the action density equals to the variance density divided by the relative frequency and the expression is 18 n σ θ e σ θ σ where θ is the wave direction and σ is the relative frequency the spectral action balance equation describes the wave spectrum evolution and this equation in cartesian coordinates can be written as 19 n t x c x n y c y n σ c σ n θ c θ n s σ the first term of the equation on the left side is the local change rate of action density of time the second term refers to the propagation in the x direction with propagation velocities c x and the third term is same as the second term but in the y direction the fourth term is the shifting of the relative frequency caused by the change of currents and water depths with propagation velocity c σ the last term refers to the refraction of currents and water depths with propagation velocity c θ which is derived from linear wave theory s is the source term which represents the impacts of dissipation wind generation and non linear wave wave interactions the main components of dissipation are bottom friction white capping and wave breaking due to the changing depth 3 4 wave model setup and validation the research domain for the wave model is the same as that of the wind model which has been described in section 3 2 the number of directions of the wave model is 36 the frequency range is from 0 04 hz to 1 hz which covers the typical range of surface wave periods from 1 s to 25 s the calculations were carried out with a time step of 20 min in the non stationary mode and the output time step was set to 1 h the large grid rang is 116 e 131 e and 23 n 41 n with resolution 0 1 by 0 1 the range of emphasis sea area near of yangtze river delta is 119 e 125 e and 27 n 34 n using 1 min grid resolution the hindcast wave parameters are stored in the data set in the time series of 1 h length on the grid during each year from 1981 to 2015 which is a total of 35 years the output parameters of the swan model are the significant wave heights h s mean wave directions and spectral mean periods t m01 based on the moments m 0 and m 1 the zero up crossing period which is approximately equal to t m02 in the narrow band the energy period t e which is also recorded as the spectral period t m 10 based on the spectral moments m 0 and m 1 the normalized frequency width of the spectrum and the directional spreading of the waves the wave power density was estimated based on the spatial records of h s and t e the observation station is used to validate the wind field fig 1 shows the simulations of buoy 22001 which is located in the east china sea from fig 4 we can see that the values of the simulated significant wave heights are in great agreement with the observation data furthermore the buoy located in the yangtze river delta is also verified and the results are shown in fig 5 which show great agreement between the simulation data and observation data this finding indicates that in general the swan model can estimate the wave parameters around the yangtze river delta well 4 results and discussions 4 1 annual wind and wave energy estimation the 35 year database simulated by the wrf model that was introduced in section 2 was used to evaluate the spatial patterns of wind climate the annual spatial patterns of wind speeds significant wave heights and their power density are shown in fig 6 it is obvious from fig 6 that the wind power density is smaller near the coast mostly because of the dissipation near the land in the current calculation the wind speed and wind energy in the southeast is larger than those in the northwest it is observed that wind speeds mostly range from 6 to 7 6 m s and the wind power density mostly ranges from 200 to 440 w m2 the largest wind speed which exceeds 7 6 m s appears in the south the largest average wind power density also appears in the south and is generally more than 440 w m2 in addition we select a 35 year data base generated by the swan model to obtain the spatial patterns of wave climate the annual averaged wave parameters h s and p of every point are obtained to get the spatial distribution maps fig 5 shows the mean annual spatial distribution of the significant wave heights and wave power density fig 7 presents that the wave power is lower near the coasts than the wave power offshore the reason might be that the wave power is dissipated when the water depth becomes shallow according to the present study the significant wave height and wave power is large in the southeast and small in the northwest this finding is because the sea area in the se is influenced more by typhoons than the sea air in the nw since typhoons originate from the northwest pacific significant wave heights of 0 1 5 m and wave power capacities of 0 14 kw m are observed in most sea areas the largest significant wave height of more than 1 5 m occurs in the se where the largest average wave power potential also occurs with more than 14 kw m 4 2 monthly wind and wave energy estimation the characteristics of wind and waves as well as their power density are dependent on weather conditions therefore we select the mean field of each month across 35 years to calculate the mean monthly wind and wave distributions the mean monthly distributions of wind speeds are presented in fig 8 the lowest wind speeds occur in may while the largest wind speeds 9 m s occur in december the mean monthly distributions of wind power density are shown in fig 9 the distributions are similar to the wind fields in that the lowest value appears in may while the largest wind energy potential 700 w m2 appears in december besides the wind speeds and power potential in the southwest yangtze river delta are both maximum during the year fig 10 shows the mean monthly distributions of significant wave heights for twelve months while fig 11 shows the mean monthly distributions of wave power density for twelve months it is clear from the figures that the largest monthly mean significant wave heights appear in december while the largest monthly mean wave power occurs in august this finding is because typhoons often occur in the summer and the wave period is largely influenced by the swell wave the smallest value of the monthly mean significant wave height and wave power both occur in may because of the dry monsoon and summer monsoon changes in the spring 4 3 statistical analysis of the wind and wave parameters fig 12 a and fig 12 b illustrate the wind speeds and energy potential roses respectively according to the 35 year simulated parameters at 6 points fig 1 from the figures it can be seen that the directions nnw n and nne play important roles at most points the direction n is the dominant direction at p1 and p2 while the dominant direction at p4 p5 and p6 is nne the frequency of n and nne is almost the same at p3 on the other hand the frequencies of s ssw and sw are also very high with the influence of summer monsoons to evaluate the directional distributions of significant wave heights and wave power density fig 13 a and fig 13 b show the roses of significant wave heights and roses of wave energy density respectively according to 35 year hindcast data at 6 points fig 1 at point 1 nne is the dominant wave direction with a frequency greater than 15 the roses are similar at point 2 and point 3 as the n wave is the dominant wave the nnw and nne waves also play significant roles during the year the dominant wave direction is n at point 4 nne at point 5 and ne at point 6 however the ssw is also important at these 3 points because of the location and distribution of isobaths the combined scatter and energy diagrams in fig 14 present the wave energy resources in terms of wave heights and periods at the 6 points the charts express the various states of the variation of ocean conditions from the significant wave heights and energy periods and the contribution of the ocean parameters to the mean annual energy the average of the 35 year data the areas in the diagrams are separated by virtual squares with dimensions of 1 m and 1 s the number of each square indicates the presence in hours of the ocean conditions whose significant wave heights and energy periods fall into corresponding ranges the small values at the top of the figures represent the low probability of extremely large waves these values reflect that the majority of wave energy is from the contribution of significant wave heights that range from 0 m to 8 m and energy periods that range from 2 s to 12 s in addition the most of the wave energy is from the contribution of significant wave heights that range from 1 m to 4 m and the energy periods that range from 5 s to 9 s around the yangtze river delta 5 conclusions this paper states an evaluation of the wind and wave energy resources around the yangtze river delta wave fields are continuously simulated by the swan model during the period of 1981 2015 with the simulated wind field input from wrf the simulated parameters are in good agreement with observations the results illustrate that the winds southeast of the yangtze river delta are larger than those northwest furthermore the offshore waves are obviously larger than nearshore waves with an average wave power density of up to 14 kw m the average wind and wave power densities possess the lowest values in spring and

22793,smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph method is widely recognized as the accurate approach to predict the fluid structure interaction however the lack of mooring force in the program severely limits its research on the motion response of floating structures in this paper based on the dynamic analysis theory of the lumped mass method combined simultaneously with the characteristics of sph method a dynamic mooring force calculation method suitable for sph is proposed as follows the mooring line is divided into a series of virtual particles which contains the inherent attribute parameters of the mooring line and embeds it in the sph program the force of each virtual particle is calculated and then coupled with the motion equation for the hull at each time step the numerical method has been validated with the results of the flume test numerical simulations are examined so as to determine the hydrodynamic performance and interaction of breakwater with surfaces waves finally the effects of the structural width and wave characteristics on wave attenuating effect are studied graphical abstract image 1 keywords lumped mass method dynamic mooring force virtual particles limit setting transmission of force 1 introduction the ever increasing demand for energy onshore oil and gas resources has forced human to turn our attention to the ocean which facilitates the development of offshore floating structures however the fixation methods and stress conditions calculated for offshore floating structures are more complicated than those of land based structures especially for mooring line dynamics cheng et al 2018a therefore research on floating structures is inseparable from the consideration of mooring systems it is necessary to have an in depth understanding of the anchoring mode the force of the mooring line and the movement response of the floating structure for marine engineering and scientific research so the present research is mainly focused to solve the staggering problem compared with the experimental research on the floating structure mooring system numerical simulation can not only save costs but also in most cases the numerical simulation is highly consistent with the experimental results the experimental requirements under special conditions can also be solved in advance through numerical simulations to lay a good foundation for the preparation of experiments in addition the numerical simulation has no requirements on the site conditions and is not affected by the external environment with the accumulation of past project experiences and the amelioration of electronic computer capacity these previously involived above problems have widely intrigued researches and engineers cheng et al 2017 2018b ji et al 2017 subject to the maturity and penetration rate of the software the computational fluid dynamics software based on the finite element mesh method currently used in the numerical simulation of the mooring system of floating structures such as aqwa star ccm and fluent can simulate and solve most of the conditions well however due to the congenital defects of the mesh method such as preprocessing data preparation for unit meshing the mesh is prone to distortion when analyzing large deformation problems and the time related issues are repeatedly re divided into mesh according to time periods as well as the continuous improvement of particle methods in recent years more and more scholars have begun to apply particle methods to simulate and solve related problems smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph proposed by violeau 2012 was applied to simulate the wave elevation barreiro et al 2016 as lagrange particle method sph represents the problem domain as a series of discrete particles there is no need for any connection between the particles but it can effectively store the physical parameters of the object however sph as an open source software is still in development and improvement in 2007 the scholars from manchester university of the united kingdom and others developed a series of programs from the initial sphysic1 0 to the current release of multiple versions the program has experienced a long period of time now the program provides source code for two dimensional 2d three dimensional 3d calculations in which various correction techniques such as density filter xsps cspm riemann solver and artificial pressure items etc are incorporated and at the same time shear stickiness artificial stickiness and sps stickiness are also provided repulsive boundary conditions monaghan and kos 1999 rogers and dalrymple 2008 and dynamic boundary conditions crespo et al 2007 were used to treat the boundary condition as the solid wall in order to simulate accurately the free surface ozbulut et al 2013 proposed a series of vxsph apd algorithm which were obtained by combining the monaghan s xsph velocity variant algorithm and artificial particle displacement apd algorithm this algorithm could cause the results of dam break problem more accurate and improve the accuracy of the numerical simulations for violent flows with a free surface stefano 2015 improved the calculated efficiency in smoothed particle hydrodynamics which could simulate complex convection diffusion problems the traditional boundary treatment method could not deal well with the problem of momentum conservation and pressure gradient mutation at the boundary in order to further deal with the problem an improved boundary treatment approach for smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph method was presented by loe and shao 2002 and kai et al 2008 cao et al 2014 proposed a new boundary treatment method considering the boundary motion effect to study the liquid tank sloshing problem zhang et al 2017 generalized the application of sph method simulation and research on various types of fluid solid coupling and introduced the improvement of various numerical algorithms except the aspects related to the anchor chain until today scholars are still paying more attention to the improvement of sph algorithm and the improvement of precision mashy et al 2018 liu et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 wang et al 2018 only a few studies on the addition of mooring line in sph have been reported to date the information that can be obtained is that barreiro et al 2016 implemented quasi static mooring solver in sph by dual sphysics code the mooring effect of the floating structure was realized through the dual sphysics code which could effectively simulate the motion response of the floating structure and the record of the anchor chain force this method took into account all possible conditions of the mooring line relative position of anchor points and mooring points and weight of the mooring line however the method proposed by barreiro et al 2016 was based on the theoretical basis of the catenary equation which might produce unreliable results when nonlinear condition was considered in this case an integrated approach called lumped mass method toshio 1982 was used so that the idea of discretization was incorporated the method for solving dynamic mooring forces into the sph program this could further consider the effects of a coupling of mooring structure and its mooring lines by adding an output statement command to the sph program the dynamic response of the mooring line at each time step can be recorded in real time this paper is organized as follows in section 2 the basic theory of sph method is briefly introduced in section 3 a description of the presented numerical model is introduced section 4 gives and discusses the dependence of the hydrodynamic performance on the design parameters such as width wavelength and the present model is verified against the existing numerical results in addition a series of important conclusions are displayed the conclusions are presented in section 5 2 sph method in sph method the research object is decomposed into particles and the particles contain various parameters of the object through the time step iteration adjacent particles interact with each other and affect the entire problem domain

the introduction to dynamic analysis of mooring line the lumped mass method toshio 1982 korterayama 1978 is applied to take into account the effects of geometric nonlinearity and load nonlinearity of the mooring line and as shown in fig 1 the chain of anchors is simplified into a spring mass system consisting of a series of nodes and massless springs in cartesian axis assume that the acceleration of node j in the x axis and z axis direction are x j and z j respectively the normal inertial force of the fluid particle flowing in the x axis direction to the node j is denoted by f n x j as show in fig 2 the tangentially attached inertial force is denoted by f t x j as show in fig 3 the relationship between mooring force and displacement can be written as 8 f n x j m n j x j sin α j x x j f n x

where α j is the angle between node j and horizontal direction x x j and z x j are the resolution of horizontal and vertical directions of f n x j respectively the same goes for the relationship between x x j z x j and f t x j m n j and m t j are the added mass in normal and tangential direction respectively defined as 10 m n j ρ d c 2 π 4 l c h n 11 m t j ρ d c 2 π 4 l c h t where c h n is the normal direction added mass factor of node j and c h t is the tangential direction added mass factor of node j d c is the equivalent section diameter of the mooring line l is the chain length between two adjacent nodes and ρ is fluid density according to the above derivation the similar procedure can be used to obtain the force of the node j in the z axis direction as show in fig 4 and fig

cos α j m t j z j sin α j cos α j z z j f t z j sin α j m t j z j sin 2 α j byassembling the coupledeqs 8 9 12 and 13 into the global form we obtain 14 x a x i s m j x j x x j x x j x z j x z j f x j 15 z a x i s m j z j z x j z x j z z j z z j f z j unfolds into 16 m j x j m n j x j sin 2 α j m t j x j cos 2 α j m n j z j sin α j cos α j m t j z j sin α j cos α j f x j m j z j m n j x j sin α j cos α j m t j x j sin α j cos α j m n j z j cos 2 α j m t j z j sin 2 α j f z j simplified into 17 m j m n j sin 2 α j m t j cos 2 α j x j m t j m n j z j sin α j cos α j f x j m j m n j cos 2 α j m t

α j 1 f d z j δ j where f d x j and f d z j are the component of normal and tangential fluid damping forces in the horizontal and vertical direction at the node j which is proportional to the square of the relative velocity of the fluid t j corresponds to the axial tension of node j on the chain δ j isthe weight of mooring node j 3 1 solution of damping force assume that the normal and tangential velocity of the fluid at node j are u n j and u t j the velocity of the fluid is c j the speed of node j in the horizontal and vertical direction is x j z j respectively then the following relationship can be obtained 19 u n j x j c j sin α j z j cos α j u t j x j c j cos α j z j sin α j the expression of the damping force in the normal and tangential directions of the fluid is obtained from the morison formula 20 f d n j 1 2 ρ d l c n u n j u n j f d t j 1 2 ρ d l c t u t j u t j where f d n j and f d t j c n and c t represent the damping force of fluid in the normal and tangential direction the damping force coefficient of fluid in the normal and tangential direction respectively and the component of f d n j and f d t j in the horizontal and vertical direction can be written as f d n x f d n j sin α j f d n z f d n j cos α j f d t x f d t j cos α j f d t z f d t j sin α j it is known that 21 f d x j f d n x f d t x f d n j sin α j f d t j cos α j f d z j f d n z f d t z f d n j cos α j f d t j sin α j using eq 20 and eq 19 in eq 21 the following expressions can be written 22a f d x j 1 2 ρ d l c n u n j u n j sin α j 1 2 ρ d l c t u t j u t j cos α j f d z j 1 2 ρ d l c

j δ j m 2 f d x j m 1 m 3 m 2 2 the dynamic analysis of mooring line based on lumped mass method is described as below firstly the tension of each node of the mooring line and the tension transmission between each adjacent node can be solved from eq 18 and then the motion response of each node is obtained through eq 25 based on the tension of each node the analysis of the tension and motion response of the endpoint will be discussed in detail in the section 4conjuncted with sph 4 implementation of the program the whole computational domain in sph method is divided into a series of water particles which are assigned from with facilitating iterative operations in sph particles are clearly divided into two categories fluid and solid wall particles on the one hand the fluid particles are controlled by the riemann algorithm and the time step is used as a link to calculate the variables on the other hand the solid wall particles are further divided into movable fixed wall particles and unmovable solid wall particles both of them are based on the theoretical basis of the force and reaction force for participating in the calculation of the program the addition of the mooring line program is coupled to the floating body dynamics program through the matching conditions at the fairleads in this case the discretized mooring line particles are first derived by the program as solid wall particles in subsequent numerical calculations repulsive forces are usually generated with the fluid particles which can t penetrate the mooring line particles this is inconsistent with the reality if the mooring line particles are treated as fluid particles due to their discontinuity without breaking therefore a series of virtual particles are used to ensure the deformability of the mooring line and achieve continuity without generating additional repulsive forces on the surrounding fluid particles and affecting the calculation results of the program 4 1 nodal force after selecting the parameters of the mooring line the initial state of the chain can be determined by eq 26 26 z h ω g cosh ω g h x c where ω is the weight of the mooring line unit length h is the horizontal tension at the initial time c is a parameter related to the position of the mooring line in the coordinate system in the program operation process the forces on each node of the mooring line can be solved by eq 18 and the angle φ j is easily obtained through φ j tan 1 f zj f xj the difference from node 1 to node n as show in fig 1 is that the end node n is directly connected with the floating structure and the unanchored force f x n and f z n that is subjected to is the external force of the floating structure finally the force of each node is accumulated and reacted to the floating structure so as to achieve the anchoring effect of the floating structure in the process of operation program the difficulty in real time solving the mooring force is to calculate the damping coefficient c j of the fluid in the operation of the main program it is possible to judge the recent fluid particles at any time by the conditional statement and treat it as a water particle with damping force on the node j since the magnitude of each time step in the program operation is minus five power seconds the additional force generated on the node j due to the change in the velocity of the fluid particles in the adjacent two time steps is negligible it is only necessary to record the instantaneous velocity of the fluid particles closest to the node j at the end of each time step by traversing all the chain particles through this method the damping force of the chain at any time can be obtained 4 2 nodal motion response after selecting the value of the parameters c h n c h t c n and c t according to the specific operating conditions the acceleration of each node can be obtained by eq 25 here the velocity x j and z j can be written as 27 x j n 1 2 x j n δ t 2 x j n z j n 1 2 z j n δ t 2 z j n where the superscript n denotes time step δ t is the size of the time step leimkuhler et al 1997 for the mooring system because its anchor point node 1 as show in fig 1 is fixed when solving for the position of each node at any time it should be gradually solved with node 1 as a reference and thus the general expression is as follows 28 x j x j 1 l c o s α j 1 x j 1 l c o s arctan f z j 1 f x j 1 z j z j 1 l s i n α j 1 z j 1 l s i n arctan f z j 1 f x j 1 combiningeqs 25 27 and 28 it can be noted that the motion response of the node at any moment is only related to the stress that the node bears 4 3 limit setting the dynamic response of the mooring system needs to take into account the appearance of two situations first the mooring line is stretched to its maximum length second the other nodes except node 1 bottoming out this means that only the position information of each node is set as a basis that is the above mentioned possible situation and a corresponding algorithm can be invoked for the first case it is necessary to calculate the distance between the end node n and the anchor point at the operation time when it is determined that the distance is equal to the maximum length of the mooring line the algorithm is then changed the floating structure is acted on the mooring line an opposing force forcing it to limit its movement to the opposite direction at the next time step for the second case the vertical distance between each node and the anchor point is compared at each iteration step the newton raphson iteration is required within the process of program operation when the value is equal to zero it indicates that the node is touching the bottom recorded as node k in the next time step nodes from the anchor point to the node k do not participate in the calculation which has no effect on the vertical motion of the floating structure 29 f b x f b x i n i j k n f x j f b z f b z i n i j k n f z j θ θ i n i d z n j k n f x j d x n j k n f z j ϖ where f b x and f b z correspond to the combined force of the floating structure in the x axis and z axis directions respectively f b x i n i and f b z i n i are the combined force in the x axis and z axis directions when the floating structure is not anchored θ is the corner of the floating structure θ i n i is the corner of the floating structure that is not anchored d z n and d x n are the vertical distance in z axis and x axis directions from node n to the center of the floating structure respectively ϖ is the moment of inertia of the floating structure 5 model validation an experimental verification case is presented in this section to validate behavior of the floating structure firstly a wave flume is set up to verify that the set numerical simulation conditions are correct the numerical wave flume is 16 m long 0 6 m deep and the initial position of the wave plate is x 0 2 m the length of the tail clipping layer is 1 25 times the wavelength the push board wave method is used to simulate the regular wave with a wave height of 0 15m and a period of 1s the parameters such as the initial particle spacing dr the initial smooth length coefficient c the viscous force coefficient v and the time step dt that affect the numerical simulation accuracy in sph are selected according to experience the numerical values of different sizes were simulated and compared with the results see fig 7 according to the comparison of the wave height time curve obtained by measuring point 1 see fig 6 the values ofdr 0 01 c 0 915 v 1e 5 dt 1e 5 are finally selected and the speed of sound should be 10 times greater than the speed of the flow field after convergence analysis in order to ensure the accuracy of the numerical simulation the numerical wave flume as shown in fig 6 is also adopted and the regular waves with an incident wave height of 0 1 m and a wave period of 1 4sis selected fig 8 depicts the comparison diagram of numerical simulation results and theoretical calculation it can be observed the numerical simulation is highly consistent with the theoretical results which validates and confirms the capability of the present formulation and numerical method in resolving the nonlinear waves mooring structure interaction here in order to verify the applicability of the newly added mooring line program to large floating structures the simulation results of the mature and reliable aqwa software are used as reference basis and the simulation results are compared by scale to scale conversion the scale ratio is 1 20 the solid model constructed in aqwa is a square box type floating breakwater with a length of 10m a width of 15 2m and a height of 4m the draft is 2m the regular wave with a wave height of 2m and the wave period is 1 4s the water depth is 12m the single mooring line is 15 3m long and the line weight is 158 kg m the mooring point is the intersection of the edge of the breakwater and the waterline at the initial moment and the initial horizontal distance between the anchor point and the mooring point is 6m by setting the corresponding conditions in the sph model as shown in fig 10 the final calculation results are compared as shown in fig 9 it can be seen that although there are some differences between the simulation results of sph and the aqwa at local time the effect on the structure is the same for a long period of time it shows that the mooring line program added according to the lumped mass method can also simulate the motion response of the anchored large sized structure the difference between the comparison results may be that aqwa simulates a three dimensional large scale problem and sph simulates a two dimensional small scale problem the process from three dimensional to two dimensional transformation and scale reduction affects the result the validation studies on a floating structure are conducted under the action of wave packet the floating structure is a rectangular prism with0 5m long 0 2m high and 0 76m wide the ratio of the structural and water density is 0 5 the mass of the body is 38 kg in three dimensional space but the simulation is performed in two dimensional state the detailed experiment setup is show in fig 10 the input conditions are as follows waves with a height of 0 1m and periods of 1 4s and 2 0s are used for experiments and numerical simulations respectively fig 11 shows the movement of the floating body at different times under experimental conditions and numerical simulations fig 12 describes a comparison experimental data and numerical simulation results obtained by the dynamic mooring line force program that has been put into sph the numerical results is highly consistent with the experimental data which suggest that the present numerical model can correctly capture the main features of wave scattering by the floating structure especially for the reflections from both front and rear parts of floating breakwater from the comparison results in fig 12 it is also interesting that the mooring line program added in sph can play a very good role in anchoring the movement of the floating structure in addition experimental results show more distinct nonlinear effect on the pitch motion as the super harmonic component is noticeable which is mainly because the gap between the structure and the flume wall has an obvious influence on the hydrodynamic performance of the floating body by analyzing the specific working conditions different c h n c h t c n and c t values are introduced that can make the motion response amplitude of the floating structure match well with the experimental results and the results of comparison between the experimental and numerical simulation of mooring line forces in front and behind model embankments are presented in fig 13 6 application here the wave breaking effect on the hydrodynamic behavior of the mooring floating breakwater with three different dimensions are simulated using the developed numerical tool in the numerical simulation some parameters for draught of 0 1m height of 0 2m structural density of 500 kg m 3 width of 0 5m 1m and 1 5m respectively are used the corresponding computational domain is taken as length of 16m water depth of 0 6m wave height defined as 0 1m and the period with from 1s to 2s as show in fig 14 fig 15 shows the comparison results of three different widths of floating breakwaters at the wave height of 0 1m and 0 15m respectively it is obvious that the experimental results and the numerical analysis show good coincidence and as the wave period increases the transmission coefficients of the breakwater become slower along the wavelength direction in addition the larger the size of the breakwater leads to the more obvious the wave s wave eliminating effect when h 0 1m t 1 5m and 1 9s the two extreme points may be because when t 1 5s the motion response amplitude of the breakwater reaches the maximum tensile length of the mooring line with the further increase of the period the movement of the breakwater is restricted by the mooring line resulting in a decrease in the transmission coefficient when t 1 9s since the wave period is close to the natural frequency of the breakwater the transmission coefficient suddenly becomes smaller the same is true for the two extreme points that occur when h 0 15m t 1 6s and 1 9s 7 conclusions the anchoring effect on the floating body is considered by adding some functionalities into the sph firstly a numerical wave flume is established and applied to compared with the theoretical value which reveals that the set parameters are in accordance with the requirements of the calculation accuracy and the mooring line can be accounted by the lumped mass method the program and verification of the added program through experimental comparison is to meet the requirements of actual operating conditions a series of numerical calculations are carried out and the following observations can be derived the mooring line particles cannot be selected in the visualization process thus the stress of each virtual particle on the mooring line cannot be solved at each time step but by adding an output statement command to the sph program the dynamic response of the mooring line at each time step can be recorded in real time moreover at the initial stage there is a certain time difference in the entire simulation process which reveals that the effect of the added program on the floating body does not agree well with the measured data however as time progresses it is possible to obtain an ideal anchoring effect on the floating body and the amplitude of its motion response is controlled to be the same as the actual situation the mooring line program which is based on the lumped mass method has the same effect on the floating structure comparedwith the actual situation as time increases that means the added program can be used to simulate and solve problems related to the anchorage floating body acknowledgement this study was supported financially by the national natural science foundation of china grant no 51779111 51609109 51779111 natural

22793,smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph method is widely recognized as the accurate approach to predict the fluid structure interaction however the lack of mooring force in the program severely limits its research on the motion response of floating structures in this paper based on the dynamic analysis theory of the lumped mass method combined simultaneously with the characteristics of sph method a dynamic mooring force calculation method suitable for sph is proposed as follows the mooring line is divided into a series of virtual particles which contains the inherent attribute parameters of the mooring line and embeds it in the sph program the force of each virtual particle is calculated and then coupled with the motion equation for the hull at each time step the numerical method has been validated with the results of the flume test numerical simulations are examined so as to determine the hydrodynamic performance and interaction of breakwater with surfaces waves finally the effects of the structural width and wave characteristics on wave attenuating effect are studied graphical abstract image 1 keywords lumped mass method dynamic mooring force virtual particles limit setting transmission of force 1 introduction the ever increasing demand for energy onshore oil and gas resources has forced human to turn our attention to the ocean which facilitates the development of offshore floating structures however the fixation methods and stress conditions calculated for offshore floating structures are more complicated than those of land based structures especially for mooring line dynamics cheng et al 2018a therefore research on floating structures is inseparable from the consideration of mooring systems it is necessary to have an in depth understanding of the anchoring mode the force of the mooring line and the movement response of the floating structure for marine engineering and scientific research so the present research is mainly focused to solve the staggering problem compared with the experimental research on the floating structure mooring system numerical simulation can not only save costs but also in most cases the numerical simulation is highly consistent with the experimental results the experimental requirements under special conditions can also be solved in advance through numerical simulations to lay a good foundation for the preparation of experiments in addition the numerical simulation has no requirements on the site conditions and is not affected by the external environment with the accumulation of past project experiences and the amelioration of electronic computer capacity these previously involived above problems have widely intrigued researches and engineers cheng et al 2017 2018b ji et al 2017 subject to the maturity and penetration rate of the software the computational fluid dynamics software based on the finite element mesh method currently used in the numerical simulation of the mooring system of floating structures such as aqwa star ccm and fluent can simulate and solve most of the conditions well however due to the congenital defects of the mesh method such as preprocessing data preparation for unit meshing the mesh is prone to distortion when analyzing large deformation problems and the time related issues are repeatedly re divided into mesh according to time periods as well as the continuous improvement of particle methods in recent years more and more scholars have begun to apply particle methods to simulate and solve related problems smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph proposed by violeau 2012 was applied to simulate the wave elevation barreiro et al 2016 as lagrange particle method sph represents the problem domain as a series of discrete particles there is no need for any connection between the particles but it can effectively store the physical parameters of the object however sph as an open source software is still in development and improvement in 2007 the scholars from manchester university of the united kingdom and others developed a series of programs from the initial sphysic1 0 to the current release of multiple versions the program has experienced a long period of time now the program provides source code for two dimensional 2d three dimensional 3d calculations in which various correction techniques such as density filter xsps cspm riemann solver and artificial pressure items etc are incorporated and at the same time shear stickiness artificial stickiness and sps stickiness are also provided repulsive boundary conditions monaghan and kos 1999 rogers and dalrymple 2008 and dynamic boundary conditions crespo et al 2007 were used to treat the boundary condition as the solid wall in order to simulate accurately the free surface ozbulut et al 2013 proposed a series of vxsph apd algorithm which were obtained by combining the monaghan s xsph velocity variant algorithm and artificial particle displacement apd algorithm this algorithm could cause the results of dam break problem more accurate and improve the accuracy of the numerical simulations for violent flows with a free surface stefano 2015 improved the calculated efficiency in smoothed particle hydrodynamics which could simulate complex convection diffusion problems the traditional boundary treatment method could not deal well with the problem of momentum conservation and pressure gradient mutation at the boundary in order to further deal with the problem an improved boundary treatment approach for smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph method was presented by loe and shao 2002 and kai et al 2008 cao et al 2014 proposed a new boundary treatment method considering the boundary motion effect to study the liquid tank sloshing problem zhang et al 2017 generalized the application of sph method simulation and research on various types of fluid solid coupling and introduced the improvement of various numerical algorithms except the aspects related to the anchor chain until today scholars are still paying more attention to the improvement of sph algorithm and the improvement of precision mashy et al 2018 liu et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 wang et al 2018 only a few studies on the addition of mooring line in sph have been reported to date the information that can be obtained is that barreiro et al 2016 implemented quasi static mooring solver in sph by dual sphysics code the mooring effect of the floating structure was realized through the dual sphysics code which could effectively simulate the motion response of the floating structure and the record of the anchor chain force this method took into account all possible conditions of the mooring line relative position of anchor points and mooring points and weight of the mooring line however the method proposed by barreiro et al 2016 was based on the theoretical basis of the catenary equation which might produce unreliable results when nonlinear condition was considered in this case an integrated approach called lumped mass method toshio 1982 was used so that the idea of discretization was incorporated the method for solving dynamic mooring forces into the sph program this could further consider the effects of a coupling of mooring structure and its mooring lines by adding an output statement command to the sph program the dynamic response of the mooring line at each time step can be recorded in real time this paper is organized as follows in section 2 the basic theory of sph method is briefly introduced in section 3 a description of the presented numerical model is introduced section 4 gives and discusses the dependence of the hydrodynamic performance on the design parameters such as width wavelength and the present model is verified against the existing numerical results in addition a series of important conclusions are displayed the conclusions are presented in section 5 2 sph method in sph method the research object is decomposed into particles and the particles contain various parameters of the object through the time step iteration adjacent particles interact with each other and affect the entire problem domain

the introduction to dynamic analysis of mooring line the lumped mass method toshio 1982 korterayama 1978 is applied to take into account the effects of geometric nonlinearity and load nonlinearity of the mooring line and as shown in fig 1 the chain of anchors is simplified into a spring mass system consisting of a series of nodes and massless springs in cartesian axis assume that the acceleration of node j in the x axis and z axis direction are x j and z j respectively the normal inertial force of the fluid particle flowing in the x axis direction to the node j is denoted by f n x j as show in fig 2 the tangentially attached inertial force is denoted by f t x j as show in fig 3 the relationship between mooring force and displacement can be written as 8 f n x j m n j x j sin α j x x j f n x

where α j is the angle between node j and horizontal direction x x j and z x j are the resolution of horizontal and vertical directions of f n x j respectively the same goes for the relationship between x x j z x j and f t x j m n j and m t j are the added mass in normal and tangential direction respectively defined as 10 m n j ρ d c 2 π 4 l c h n 11 m t j ρ d c 2 π 4 l c h t where c h n is the normal direction added mass factor of node j and c h t is the tangential direction added mass factor of node j d c is the equivalent section diameter of the mooring line l is the chain length between two adjacent nodes and ρ is fluid density according to the above derivation the similar procedure can be used to obtain the force of the node j in the z axis direction as show in fig 4 and fig

velocity of the fluid at node j are u n j and u t j the velocity of the fluid is c j the speed of node j in the horizontal and vertical direction is x j z j respectively then the following relationship can be obtained 19 u n j x j c j sin α j z j cos α j u t j x j c j cos α j z j sin α j the expression of the damping force in the normal and tangential directions of the fluid is obtained

between each adjacent node can be solved from eq 18 and then the motion response of each node is obtained through eq 25 based on the tension of each node the analysis of the tension and motion response of the endpoint will be discussed in detail in the section 4conjuncted with sph 4 implementation of the program the whole computational domain in sph method is divided into a series of water particles which are assigned from with facilitating iterative operations in sph particles are clearly divided into two categories fluid and solid wall particles on the one hand the fluid particles are controlled by the riemann algorithm and the time step is used as a link to calculate the variables on the other hand the solid wall particles are further divided into movable fixed wall particles and unmovable solid wall particles both of them are based on the theoretical basis of the force and reaction force for participating in the calculation of the program the addition of the mooring line program is coupled to the floating body dynamics program through the matching conditions at the fairleads in this case the discretized mooring line particles are first derived by the program as solid wall particles in subsequent numerical calculations repulsive forces are usually generated with the fluid particles which can t penetrate the mooring line particles this is inconsistent with the reality if the mooring line particles are treated as fluid particles due to their discontinuity without breaking therefore a series of virtual particles are used to ensure the deformability of the mooring line and achieve continuity without generating additional repulsive forces on the surrounding fluid particles and affecting the calculation results of the program 4 1 nodal force after selecting the parameters of the mooring line the initial state of the chain can be determined by eq 26 26 z h ω g cosh ω g h x c where ω is the weight of the mooring line unit length h is the horizontal tension at the initial time c is a parameter related to the position of the mooring line in the coordinate system in the program operation process the forces on each node of the mooring line can be solved by eq 18 and the angle φ j is easily obtained through φ j tan 1 f zj f xj the difference from node 1 to node n as show in fig 1 is that the end node n is directly connected with the floating structure and the unanchored force f x n and f z n that is subjected to is the external force of the floating structure finally the force of each node is accumulated and reacted to the floating structure so as to achieve the anchoring effect of the floating structure in the process of operation program the difficulty in real time solving the mooring force is to calculate the damping coefficient c j of the fluid in the operation of the main program it is possible to judge the recent fluid particles at any time by the conditional statement and treat it as a water particle with damping force on the node j since the magnitude of each time step in the program operation is minus five power seconds the additional force generated on the node j due to the change in the velocity of the fluid particles in the adjacent two time steps is negligible it is only necessary to record the instantaneous velocity of the fluid particles closest to the node j at the end of each time step by traversing all the chain particles through this method the damping force of the chain at any time can be obtained 4 2 nodal motion response after selecting the value of the parameters c h n c h t c n and c t according to the specific operating conditions the acceleration of each node can be obtained by eq 25 here the velocity x j and z j can be written as 27 x j n 1 2 x j n δ t 2 x j n z j n 1 2 z j n δ t 2 z j n where the superscript n denotes time step δ t is the size of the time step leimkuhler et al 1997 for the mooring system because its anchor point node 1 as show in fig 1 is fixed when solving for the position of each node at any time it should be gradually solved with node 1 as a reference and thus the general expression is as follows 28 x j x j 1 l c o s α j 1 x j 1 l c o s arctan f z j 1 f x j 1 z j z j 1 l s i n α j 1 z j 1 l s i n arctan f z j 1 f x j 1 combiningeqs 25 27 and 28 it can be noted that the motion response of the node at any moment is only related to the stress that the node bears 4 3 limit setting the dynamic response of the mooring system needs to take into account the appearance of two situations first the mooring line is stretched to its maximum length second the other nodes except node 1 bottoming out this means that only the position information of each node is set as a basis that is the above mentioned possible situation and a corresponding algorithm can be invoked for the first case it is necessary to calculate the distance between the end node n and the anchor point at the operation time when it is determined that the distance is equal to the maximum length of the mooring line the algorithm is then changed the floating structure is acted on the mooring line an opposing force forcing it to limit its movement to the opposite direction at the next time step for the second case the vertical distance between each node and the anchor point is compared at each iteration step the newton raphson iteration is required within the process of program operation when the value is equal to zero it indicates that the node is touching the bottom recorded as node k in the next time step nodes from the anchor point to the node k do not participate in the calculation which has no effect on the vertical motion of the floating structure 29 f b x f b x i n i j k n f x j f b z f b z i n i j k n f z j θ θ i n i d z n j k n f x j d x n j k n f z j ϖ where f b x and f b z correspond to the combined force of the floating structure in the x axis and z axis directions respectively f b x i n i and f b z i n i are the combined force in the x axis and z axis directions when the floating structure is not anchored θ is the corner of the floating structure θ i n i is the corner of the floating structure that is not anchored d z n and d x n are the vertical distance in z axis and x axis directions from node n to the center of the floating structure respectively ϖ is the moment of inertia of the floating structure 5 model validation an experimental verification case is presented in this section to validate behavior of the floating structure firstly a wave flume is set up to verify that the set numerical simulation conditions are correct the numerical wave flume is 16 m long 0 6 m deep and the initial position of the wave plate is x 0 2 m the length of the tail clipping layer is 1 25 times the wavelength the push board wave method is used to simulate the regular wave with a wave height of 0 15m and a period of 1s the parameters such as the initial particle spacing dr the initial smooth length coefficient c the viscous force coefficient v and the time step dt that affect the numerical simulation accuracy in sph are selected according to experience the numerical values of different sizes were simulated and compared with the results see fig 7 according to the comparison of the wave height time curve obtained by measuring point 1 see fig 6 the values ofdr 0 01 c 0 915 v 1e 5 dt 1e 5 are finally selected and the speed of sound should be 10 times greater than the speed of the flow field after convergence analysis in order to ensure the accuracy of the numerical simulation the numerical wave flume as shown in fig 6 is also adopted and the regular waves with an incident wave height of 0 1 m and a wave period of 1 4sis selected fig 8 depicts the comparison diagram of numerical simulation results and theoretical calculation it can be observed the numerical simulation is highly consistent with the theoretical results which validates and confirms the capability of the present formulation and numerical method in resolving the nonlinear waves mooring structure interaction here in order to verify the applicability of the newly added mooring line program to large floating structures the simulation results of the mature and reliable aqwa software are used as reference basis and the simulation results are compared by scale to scale conversion the scale ratio is 1 20 the solid model constructed in aqwa is a square box type floating breakwater with a length of 10m a width of 15 2m and a height of 4m the draft is 2m the regular wave with a wave height of 2m and the wave period is 1 4s the water depth is 12m the single mooring line is 15 3m long and the line weight is 158 kg m the mooring point is the intersection of the edge of the breakwater and the waterline at the initial moment and the initial horizontal distance between the anchor point and the mooring point is 6m by setting the corresponding conditions in the sph model as shown in fig 10 the final calculation results are compared as shown in fig 9 it can be seen that although there are some differences between the simulation results of sph and the aqwa at local time the effect on the structure is the same for a long period of time it shows that the mooring line program added according to the lumped mass method can also simulate the motion response of the anchored large sized structure the difference between the comparison results may be that aqwa simulates a three dimensional large scale problem and sph simulates a two dimensional small scale problem the process from three dimensional to two dimensional transformation and scale reduction affects the result the validation studies on a floating structure are conducted under the action of wave packet the floating structure is a rectangular prism with0 5m long 0 2m high and 0 76m wide the ratio of the structural and water density is 0 5 the mass of the body is 38 kg in three dimensional space but the simulation is performed in two dimensional state the detailed experiment setup is show in fig 10 the input conditions are as follows waves with a height of 0 1m and periods of 1 4s and 2 0s are used for experiments and numerical simulations respectively fig 11 shows the movement of the floating body at different times under experimental conditions and numerical simulations fig 12 describes a comparison experimental data and numerical simulation results obtained by the dynamic mooring line force program that has been put into sph the numerical results is highly consistent with the experimental data which suggest that the present numerical model can correctly capture the main features of wave scattering by the floating structure especially for the reflections from both front and rear parts of floating breakwater from the comparison results in fig 12 it is also interesting that the mooring line program added in sph can play a very good role in anchoring the movement of the floating structure in addition experimental results show more distinct nonlinear effect on the pitch motion as the super harmonic component is noticeable which is mainly because the gap between the structure and the flume wall has an obvious influence on the hydrodynamic performance of the floating body by analyzing the specific working conditions different c h n c h t c n and c t values are introduced that can make the motion response amplitude of the floating structure match well with the experimental results and the results of comparison between the experimental and numerical simulation of mooring line forces in front and behind model embankments are presented in fig 13 6 application here the wave breaking effect on the hydrodynamic behavior of the mooring floating breakwater with three different dimensions are simulated using the developed numerical tool in the numerical simulation some parameters for draught of 0 1m height of 0 2m structural density of 500 kg m 3 width of 0 5m 1m and 1 5m respectively are used the corresponding computational domain is taken as length of 16m water depth of 0 6m wave height defined as 0 1m and the period with from 1s to 2s as show in fig 14 fig 15 shows the comparison results of three different widths of floating breakwaters at the wave height of 0 1m and 0 15m respectively it is obvious that the experimental results and the numerical analysis show good coincidence and as the wave period increases the transmission coefficients of the breakwater become slower along the wavelength direction in addition the larger the size of the breakwater leads to the more obvious the wave s wave eliminating effect when h 0 1m t 1 5m and 1 9s the two extreme points may be because when t 1 5s the motion response amplitude of the breakwater reaches the maximum tensile length of the mooring line with the further increase of the period the movement of the breakwater is restricted by the mooring line resulting in a decrease in the transmission coefficient when t 1 9s since the wave period is close to the natural frequency of the breakwater the transmission coefficient suddenly becomes smaller the same is true for the two extreme points that occur when h 0 15m t 1 6s and 1 9s 7 conclusions the anchoring effect on the floating body is considered by adding some functionalities into the sph firstly a numerical wave flume is established and applied to compared with the theoretical value which reveals that the set parameters are in accordance with the requirements of the calculation accuracy and the mooring line can be accounted by the lumped mass method the program and verification of the added program through experimental comparison is to meet the requirements of actual operating conditions a series of numerical calculations are carried out and the following observations can be derived the mooring line particles cannot be selected in the visualization process thus the stress of each virtual particle on the mooring line cannot be solved at each time step but by adding an output statement command to the sph program the dynamic response of the mooring line at each time step can be recorded in real time moreover at the initial stage there is a certain time difference in the entire simulation process which reveals that the effect of the added program on the floating body does not agree well with the measured data however as time progresses it is possible to obtain an ideal anchoring effect on the floating body and the amplitude of its motion response is controlled to be the same as the actual situation the mooring line program which is based on the lumped mass method has the same effect on the floating structure comparedwith the actual situation as time increases that means the added program can be used to simulate and solve problems related to the anchorage floating body acknowledgement this study was supported financially by the national natural science foundation of china grant no 51779111 51609109 51779111 natural

22794,the proposed design named as the hybrid propulsion underwater robotic vehicle hpurv is a novel underwater vehicle with a hybridized propulsion for minimum energy consumption in ocean observations this development is aimed at the comparison of different types of propulsion techniques in both vertical and horizontal directions of the motion to choose an optimum strategy for propulsion the horizontal motion is achieved using the bio inspired method of fish propulsion using caudal fin or a pair of pectoral fins or both the tail design is made modular such that the caudal fin can be replaced by a conventional miniature thruster to understand the performance characteristics of the vehicle under similar operating conditions the diving climbing pitching and rolling motions are achieved using three different mechanisms for viz 1 pitch and dive using pectoral fins 2 pitch and dive by varying buoyancy of the vehicle and 3 pitch dive and roll by using a moving mass and a rolling mass mechanisms respectively all these mechanisms are assembled in the same vehicle and controlled independently or using a combination of two or more different mechanisms for the performance comparison of the vehicle in similar operating conditions this paper also presents a dynamic model of the hpurv and a motion control scheme using a conventional proportional derivative pd control technique to track a given complex spatial trajectory keywords underwater vehicle hybrid propulsion system bio inspired systems underwater glider buoyancy engine fin propulsion 1 introduction the conventional observation techniques from research vessels in the deep sea incur huge expenditures because of operational costs and unavailability of ships during required times generally research cruises last not more than a month or two and observations may also halt during hostile weather conditions these operational issues and uncertainties are limiting the detailed ocean s monitoring davis et al 2002 ironically ocean variability does not wait for the research vessels to reach the location for observations this limited sampling of the ocean and the relatively costly conventional observation platforms has made the scientific community think and develop low cost technologies that provide better endurance through both the spatial and temporal scales the ocean observation platforms are broadly classified based on the application and operational characteristics as in situ observations using sensors mounted on ships buoys moorings coastal stations etc and remote sensing observations such as aircraft radar and satellite etc the in situ measurements have progressed through ages due to the advanced observation strategies and equipment they provide highly accurate and excellent resolution data compared to remote sensing observations the in situ ocean observation platforms are further broadly classified as shipboard fixed and mobile platforms as shown in fig 1 the evolution of these observation platforms has laid great emphasis on improving the quality and endurance of measurements observations thus leading to the development of unmanned systems such as deep sea and coastal moorings mounted with sensors instruments for continuous sampling of many ocean properties moored buoys are one of the most common and cost effective means to obtain oceanographic data but the moorings can provide data only in temporal scale so a vast network of moorings have to be deployed for spatial scale observations this limitation was overcome by using mobile unmanned platforms such as remotely operable semi autonomous and autonomous systems for both surface and sub surface measurements remotely operable vehicle rov is a remote controlled underwater robot tethered to a mothership or any other floating platform on the surface that provide power and control communication signal to the vehicle thus making it a suitable for complicated underwater operations as far as ocean observations are concerned the rovs limit the range of observations due to limited tether length and require an ample power supply to propel the rov as the most percentage of power is consumed in overcoming the drag of the tether the rov operations for ocean observations are limited to the order of days due to the available ship time for the operation however untethered vehicles such as an autonomous underwater vehicle auv depend on the onboard power supply battery with its built in intelligence to execute its mission by drifting cruising or glide through the ocean humphris 2010 with speed ranging from 0 5 m s to 2 5 m s the advantage of auvs over rovs is their endurance where propeller driven vehicles typically operate in the order of 8 50 h von alt 2003 and buoyancy propelled vehicles such as underwater gliders and floats can run in the order of months in transoceanic ranges creating a large amount of data sampling at the expense of limited transit speeds ranging from 0 15 m s to 0 25 m s webb et al 2001 the floats drift through the ocean currents for measurements whose location of the sampling is unfeasible to control whereas the gliders assured this control to a certain extent over the region of interest to be sampled but navigation of gliders in regions of strong current affects the observational capability due to the ineffective vehicle maneuverability also the gliders perform well in a vertical plane but the operations in horizontal directions are significantly affected due to the saw tooth pattern principle thus leading to operational constraints in a horizontal plane or in shallow regions or near shallow regions where the depth of observational water column is small gliders with low transit speeds and sluggish response for navigation combined with the propeller power offers a relatively better endurance and capability to overcome strong current chen et al 2016 but the thruster efficiency is observed to be not more than 40 percent triantafyllou and triantafyllou 1995 tzeranis et al 2006 whereas implementing bio inspired swimming techniques can help to outperform conventional thruster based auvs in the areas of maneuverability and control authority bandyopadhyay 2005 in this regard the present development of hpurv is attempted as a combination of buoyancy and bio inspired propulsion strategies to improve the vehicle efficiency during ocean observations using two different propulsion techniques in the same vehicle and intermittently to switch between the propulsion strategies based on the requirement 2 background and rationale behind the current development swimming methods of fish are various and interesting they do not have propellers and get along very well without them they are highly efficient and highly maneuverable at the same time also in the bio inspired propulsion the problem of cavitation during operation can be mitigated compared to the conventional propulsion systems like thrusters fish have many specialized modes of movement of fins and based on the same they are classified into anguilliform subcarangiform carangiform thunniform ostraciiform rajiform diodontiform amiiform gymnotiform balistiform labriform and tetraodontiform sfakiotakis et al 1999 the hpurv development is inspired by the boxfish which uses ostraciiform of propulsion it is believed that the boxfish propels by oscillating only a tail fin without affecting the body this belief was the traditional understanding of boxfish swimming technique until different biological studies hove et al 2001 showed that ostraciiform of swimming utilizes multiple fins than simply wagging the tail blake 1977 gordon et al 2000 bartol et al 2003 bartol 2005 have reported that the hull dynamics and construction of fish such as box fish carapace with keel structures leads to vortices forming around the keels that stabilize the boxfishes movements but a later study van wassenbergh et al 2014 showed that the front part of the boxfish carapace generates destabilizing forces that dominate the effect of the stabilizing vortices as shown in fig 2 these destabilizing forces provide the boxfish with significant maneuverability few other vehicles were also developed based on ostraciiform phenomenon viz boxybot lachat et al 2006 boxfish like robots wang and xie 2014 and micro autonomous robotic ostraciiform marco kodati et al 2008 but could not achieve the efficiencies as anticipated compared to that of the conventional thrusters required for long range applications it should be noted that the aim of the present research is not to mimic the exact characteristics of the boxfish but as an inspiration from boxfish swimming characteristics as far as the propulsion pitching and maneuverability issues are concerned different fish employ different strategies i e caudal fin pectoral fins dorsal fin and buoyancy variation etc many fish swim using their pectoral fins alone lauder and madden 2006 pectoral fins can make the fish maintain stability and help to swim up and down to some extent in fact even just for hovering fishes must oscillate their pectoral fins to correct its intrinsic instability lauder and madden 2006 due to these advantages of the pectoral fins the hpurv is equipped with pectoral fins for the present development few fishes control their buoyancy in the water by finely controlling its volume making it possible to travel up and down in the water an organ known as a swim bladder allows the fish to quickly adjust its density relative to its surroundings by changing the volume of the bladder some underwater robots employ piston mechanisms to ballast the submersible low 2006 in line with the current requirement of better endurance unmanned vehicles such as underwater gliders use buoyancy based propulsion inspired from the fish and act as a virtual mooring for ocean observations meyer 2016 where the speed and the vehicle response are limited generally buoyancy propulsion is an intermittent operation and the variable buoyancy module is operated during the start and end of the ascent or descent of the vehicle this advantage makes the buoyancy propulsion an efficient technique with limited speeds almost all the commercial gliders utilize moving mass mechanism for both pitch and roll successfully the same has been attempted in the hpurv considering the advantages and limitations of each propulsion strategy the hpurv is conceptualized using a combination of the above discussed techniques to assist the vehicle performance in terms of speed and response whenever required here the word hybrid refers to the combination of two or more distinct features of conventional system or process and the term system can refer an unmanned vehicle and the term process refers to a vehicle control procedure in the underwater robotics domain based on the application and utility there are many different interpretations but the term hybrid is commonly interpreted as a vehicle which can operate both as an auv and an rov based on the performance requirement and thus utilize the advantages of auv and rov moore et al 2010 nereus is one such example of hybrid unmanned autonomous underwater vehicles developed by the woods hole oceanographic institution whoi which could operate at depths of up to 11000m bowen et al 2008 few hybrid vehicles chen et al 2016 claus 2009 claus et al 2010 isa et al 2014 yang et al 2016 alvarez et al 2009 in line with current development have been developed as a combination of buoyancy and propeller based propulsion similarly a hybrid underwater glider in combination with fin based thrust zhang et al 2014 li et al 2018 is designed to exploit energy efficient locomotion in gliding and a bio inspired fin for better maneuverability considering the possible criterion for ocean observation and exploration the proposed design of hpurv is aimed at evaluation of different types of propulsion techniques in both vertical and horizontal directions of the motion to choose an optimum strategy for propulsion all the propulsion strategies are adapted in the same vehicle and switching among these techniques whenever required would help first understand and later improve the vehicle performance 3 design overview the hpurv comprises a pressure hull housing electrical and electronic components and sub components a dual buoyancy controlling module is placed at the fore and aft of the hull for buoyancy propulsion two direct current dc servo motors with position feedback are used for caudal fin and pectoral fin actuation a pitch roll moving mass mechanism comprises of a linear actuator for linear motion of the mass and a third dc servo motor for rolling the mass a rechargeable battery unit provides the power supply to all the electrical subsystems and an onboard microcontroller with data storage capability is programmed to control different modes of operation of the vehicle the pressure hull is fabricated in shape comparable to that of boxfish as shown in fig 3 and the design overview of each of the subsystems are detailed below 3 1 hull the pressure hull of the hpurv is made up of glass fiber reinforced plastic gfrp sealed and rated to dive up to a depth of 30 m as shown in fig 4 it is hydrodynamically streamlined to a shape of boxfish carapace and assembled with caudal fin and pair of pectoral fins the hull comprises mainly three parts viz free flooding nose at the bow sealed chamber in the middle for the assembly of all subsystems and stern sealed chamber for caudal fin actuator the middle chamber is made up into two halves for ease of assembly with aluminium reinforcements at each end to mount o rings for sealing and to provide stiffness to the hull during assembly openings are provided in the nose and stern bulkheads made of aluminium to fit the buoyancy cylinders and for mounting penetrators and connectors 3 2 fins and thruster dc servo motors are used to actuate the caudal fin and a pair of pectoral fins using sealed shafts the dc servo motor of the caudal fin is an independent module attached to the vehicle where the caudal fin can be replaced with a thruster of same power output for performance comparison of the thruster based and the caudal fin based propulsion under similar conditions as shown in fig 5 another dc servo motor is used to actuate the pair of pectoral fins to generate flapping motion i e thrust generation as well pitching the pectoral fins provide a sawtooth profile for gliding at a particular angle of attack and thrust generation during flapping the hpurv can also perform active pitch control for change of effective glide angles by using the pectoral fins as control surfaces 3 3 variable buoyancy vb module two buoyancy control modules are placed at forward and aft of the vehicle to form a dual buoyancy controlling module for changing the buoyancy as shown in fig 6 the two buoyancy controlling modules comprise linear actuators to move a set of plungers in both forward and aft buoyancy modules the forward buoyancy module is to glide profile in the water column and the aft buoyancy module is used for pre dive autonomous ballasting based on the change in the payload for a particular mission the redundant reserve buoyancy of the vehicle enables the vehicle to operate at a broader range of densities from lighter fresh water to dense saline water yang et al 2017 3 4 pitch roll moving mass mechanism a pitch roll moving mass mechanism as shown in fig 7 comprises a linear actuator and a dc servo motor to drive a mass along the longitudinal axis of the vehicle and rolls the same mass about the same axis the mass used here is a dense metal deadweight the pitch of the vehicle is achieved by moving the mass along the axis of the vehicle whereas the roll of the vehicle is made by rolling the same mass for a particular pitch angle about the longitudinal axis these motions are achieved without actuating the caudal fin or the pair of pectoral fins during the gliding motion 3 5 power control and communication the power to the hybrid vehicle is provided by a battery unit placed inside the pressure hull an onboard controller with data storage capability is programmed to control different modes of operation of the vehicle such as an autonomous underwater vehicle mode auv mode a glider mode and a vertical profiler mode which are discussed in the next section the controller takes the decision based on the requirement of the user or through the preprogrammed codes the controller is programmed to abort the current missions by surfacing in case of an emergency such as if the hpurv dives beyond a prescribed depth the vehicle is manually switched on by using an external switch and a particular mission mode is chosen using wired communication during the start of the mission 3 6 operation overview the swimming actions like surge pitch and yaw at a particular angle in both semi autonomous and autonomous modes are to be achieved for which a control system and algorithm needs to developed which would help the hpurv in required path planning and perform the above activities it is proposed to check the feasibility of the control system for three different types of operational strategies and an optimized system would be chosen based on the simulation results the final version of fish would be tested for hydrodynamic response with the help of tank tests the three basic modes of actuation are chosen for mathematical modeling and would be simulated each at a time and arrive at the optimized output three design modes are given below as shown in fig 8 pitch or vertical motion control by using pectoral fins pitch or vertical motion control by using the moving mass mechanism pitch or vertical motion control by varying buoyancy the final control strategy would be decided based on any of the three modes or a combination of at least two modes of operation based on the optimization results from the models developed apart from having three different modes of actuation mechanisms the hpurv operates in three different propulsion modes such as a vertical profiler mode an autonomous underwater vehicle mode auv mode and an underwater glider mode as shown in fig 9 the vertical profiler mode provides vertical profiling motion and the glider mode includes saw tooth profiling motion and the auv mode includes the spatial movement of the vehicle commercially available radio frequency r f module is placed inside the hybrid underwater vehicle and configured to communicate with the control center either on a mother ship or from a floating platform this communication is done for monitoring the vehicle on the surface during the launch and recovery the underwater communication is done using acoustic sensors after the deployment when the vehicle is under operation as shown in fig 9 the r f modules receive one or more commands from an external remote controller to choose a mission for the underwater vehicle from the already preloaded mission modes the preloaded mission modes are already programmed in the microcontroller the vehicle can also be manually switched on by using the pressure rated switch on the vehicle and choosing a particular mission mode from the external system using wired communication 3 6 1 vertical profiler mode it is a mode for vertical climbing and diving similar to that of underwater profiler madhan et al 2012 zhu et al 2015 the moving mass is shifted forward or backward in such a way that the center of gravity cog of the vehicle shifts to the forward or aft extreme thus pitching the vehicle to a vertical position with nose down after reaching the vertical position the negative buoyancy in the buoyancy module initiates the downward profiling similarly when the moving mass is moved to aft extreme the vehicle again pitches to a vertical position with the nose up now with positive buoyancy in the buoyancy module the vehicle starts the upward profiling in this operation the vehicle pitch is changed initially using the moving mass and later the buoyancy is varied based on the requirement of the direction of profiling this provides the profiling of oceanographic parameters along the depth without any glide angle 3 6 2 auv mode it operates based on the thrust generated using either or both types of fins caudal fin or pectoral fins and the dual buoyancy controlling module this mode can perform a combination of complex motions which includes maneuvering cruising yawing and motions that cannot be performed in the profiler and the glider modes 3 6 3 underwater glider mode it includes a saw tooth profile of vehicle by using buoyancy propulsion and control surfaces for an effective change of glide angles the positive buoyancy of the vehicle provides the climbing motion and the negative buoyancy provides the diving motion by adjusting the variable buoyancy module the forward gliding motion of hpurv is achieved by exploiting the lift force generated from the fins the effective glide angle is varied by either using the pectoral fins as active wings or by shifting the cog using moving mass mechanism similar to that of convention underwater gliders fig 10 shows a flowchart for the operational procedure of hpurv in three different modes the vehicle is started by manual mode or by using an r f module remotely later the onboard controller checks the health status of all the components and subsystems and updates the controller whether to start the mission or stop the mission if the health status is signaled bad after the successful health check of the components and subsystems the sensors are calibrated based on the attitude of the vehicle thus correcting the vehicle attitude by ballasting and trimming the vehicle as required for the mission the operation mode of the hpurv is chosen from the user input in the profiler mode first mode of operation based on the requirement of the user or through command read the roll pitch moving mass mechanism is actuated and shifts the mass to forward or to aft until the vehicle is vertical along the longitudinal axis the buoyancy module is actuated for either positive buoyancy or negative buoyancy after the vehicle achieves the vertical position for surfacing or diving respectively due to the change in buoyancy the vehicle moves towards the required position and a depth sensor continuously measures the current position depth of the vehicle the mission stops after the vehicle reaches the required position otherwise the controller initiates an emergency mode when the depth of the vehicle more than the permissible depth during diving to avoid loss of the vehicle the second mode of operation is the auv mode wherein the vehicle operates in mission mode preprogrammed as per the user requirement or in emergency mode for the recovery of the vehicle for keeping the vehicle in failsafe condition the third mode of operation is the glider mode wherein the process is similar to that of the profiler mode based on the requirement of the user or through command read the roll pitch moving mass mechanism is actuated and shifts the mass to forward or to aft until the vehicle reaches its required pitch angle after the vehicle achieves the angle of pitch needed the buoyancy module is actuated for either positive buoyancy or negative buoyancy for the required sawtooth pattern the mission stops after the vehicle reaches the required position the controller initiates the emergency mode as similar to that in the profiler mode in fig 10 4 dynamic modeling of the hpurv 4 1 vehicle design the operational workspace of a 6 degrees of freedom dof underwater vehicle at any given instant of time requires six controllable inputs to define the position and orientation an underactuated underwater system is a vehicle with fewer than six inputs whereas an overactuated system is a vehicle with a higher number of inputs to operate in 6 dof space the design proposed here consists of three oscillating fins which can be tilted independently using servomotors two buoyancy modules actuated using two dc motors and moving mass mechanism using a dc and servomotor for different motions the model developed here is overactuated with seven inputs for getting a controlled output in five dof excluding the sway motion the oscillating fins provide three inputs as thrust force for surge yaw and pitch two inputs are supplied by the dc motors to the buoyancy modules to provide heave and pitch two more inputs are provided to the moving mass mechanism to provide pitch and roll the hull shape is inspired by boxfish carapace with three oscillating fins the fins are placed such that one caudal fin in x z plane and two pectoral fins thrusters in x y plane both in the body fixed frame the underwater robot model presented in this paper is a combination of three fins and one rigid hull the geometrical and physical parameters of the model are displayed in table 1 4 2 assumptions a few sound assumptions were contemplated for the sake of simplicity in mathematical modeling the vehicle is considered as a rigid body with constant mass the shape of the robot has three planes of symmetry thus the off diagonal elements of the moment of inertia are neglected it is rudimentarily assumed that the robot is neutrally buoyant and the center of buoyancy coincides with the center of gravity though this is not true for the glider mode of operation lift forces can be neglected as the vehicle moves at a very slow speed the external disturbances such as ocean currents wind forces on the surface density changes and wave dynamics acting on the robot are neglected the accelerations of the underwater robot due to motion about a curved rotating earth are negligible and acceleration due to gravity is constant and is quantified as 9 81 m s2 the tuned gains are chosen as identical for the position vector η 1 and orientation vector η 2 presented in the next section 4 3 preliminary definitions two coordinate frames are defined for the analysis of the motion of the underwater vehicle the moving coordinate

angular velocities vector of the body fixed frame with respect to earth fixed frame expressed in the body fixed frame the force torque vector τ of the thruster input is given by τ x y z k m n t 4 4 equations of motion the dynamic model of the underwater vehicle is developed through the euler lagrange formulation using the principle of virtual work and d alembert s principle the equations of motion of the underwater vehicle model in general are written with respect to the body fixed frame governed by fossen 1994 as shown in equations 1 and 2 dynamic equations of motion 1 m ν c ν ν d ν ν g

sinθ tθ tanθ here the number of degrees of freedom and generalized coordinates is equal to the number of rows and number of columns respectively craig 2005 4 4 1 mass matrix the mass matrix or the inertia tensor represents the mass distribution of the rigid body composed of a rigid body and added mass terms as seen in equation 4 the rigid body term m rb consists of the mass mass moment of inertia and mass product of inertia there exists a frame called principle frame where the inertia matrix attains a diagonal form as it is symmetric and positive definite vervoort 2009 4 m m r b m a the term m a is the inertia contribution due to added mass and the terms of the added mass matrix are dependent on the shape of the underwater robot which is approximated to a rectangular parallelepiped for initial modeling the added mass is the ﬂuid surrounding the body being accelerated where a force is necessary to achieve this acceleration while the ﬂuid exerts a reaction force equal in magnitude and opposite in direction mohan and thondiyath 2011 the hydrodynamic added mass can be simplified into a diagonal matrix as the robot has three planes of symmetry moves at low speed and the center of gravity is positioned at the origin of the body fixed frame the off diagonal elements of the added mass matrix are neglected antonelli et al 2008 m a d i a g a 11 a 22 a 33 a 44 a 55 a 66 the added mass forces and moments can be derived by applying potential theory fossen 1994 newman 1977 this method is based on the assumptions of an inviscid fluid no circulation and the body is completely submerged in an unbounded liquid and the added mass coefficients are constant the added mass and inertia terms can be derived numerically by strip theory fossen 1994 newman 1977 dong 1978 triantafyllou and hover 2003 the six coefficients of added mass and inertia matrix can be derived by considering the shape of the vehicle to be a rectangular parallelepiped the resulting equations inertia matrix m is constant speed independent and positive deﬁnite m m t 0 ṁ 0 as shown in equation 5 thus the mass matrix is estimated as in jin et al 2015 georgiades 2005 5 m 13 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 35 3

mass terms where c rb ν is the rigid body term and c a ν is the added mass term coriolis terms are the components of the matrix c ij where i j and the remaining terms are due to centripetal forces c ν can always be parameterized such that it is skew symmetrical for a rigid body moving through an ideal fluid 6 c ν c r b ν c a ν the coefficients of the hydrodynamic coriolis and centripetal matrix can be derived from strip theory as well the explicit expressions for c rb ν and c a ν is found in fossen 1994 the coriolis and the centripetal matrix is estimated as jin et al 2015 is shown in equation 7

the hydrodynamic damping of underwater vehicles depends on potential viscous and wave drift damping skin friction and vortex shedding damping detailed information on the same is found in fossen 1994 triantafyllou and hover 2003 the dissipative forces due to viscosity are composed of drag and lift forces the drags are the only forces responsible for damping as the lift produced and disturbances are considered negligible as the auv moves at low speed the hydrodynamic damping terms are approximated to a non coupled diagonal matrix composed of drag force fossen 1994 the drag coefficients for angular velocities are estimated using an analytical approach georgiades 2005 the damping matrix d ν is determined newman 1977 considering only quadratic terms such that d ν 0 ν r6 the damping matrix is shown in equation 8 for the proposed model 8 d ν 0 97 u 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 08 v 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 38 w 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 004 p 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 004 q 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 05 r 4 4 4 restoring effects in the underwater environment the gravitation and buoyant forces work as restoring forces and moments the expression for g η is shown in fossen 1994 gravity and buoyancy vector can be negligible since the vehicle is neutrally buoyant and center of gravity and center of buoyancy coincide 4 4 5 dynamics of rigid fin thrust for swimming gait thrusters are generally used for propulsion and control of conventional underwater vehicles the hpurv uses control surfaces or oscillating rigid fins for thrust production and control the oscillating fin model used for simulation in the current study is adapted from the work on the four quadrants dynamic response of conventional auv thrusters and the hexapod robot model using rigid fin for the generation of gait georgiades 2005 the fin thrust model consists of two pectoral fins and one caudal fin that oscillate about a yb axis and zb axis in the body fixed frame respectively the relationship between the force moment acting on the vehicle τ and the control input of the fins f is nonlinear due to the presence of the oscillating angle is shown in equation 9 it is a function of some structural variables such as the density of the water the body fin cross sectional area the fin length the volumetric ﬂow rate through the fin oscillation vervoort 2009 b matrix is not time invariant that maps the horizontal and vertical components of thrust force vector f to generalized forces moment vectors τ both expressed in the body fixed frame 9 τ b f here b s β 1 c β 1 s β 2 c β 2 s β 3 c β 3 s β 1 c β 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 s β 2 c β 2 s β 3 c β 3 z 1 c β 1 z 1 s β 1 y 2

s β 3 y 3 c β 3 and f d 1 l 1 d 2 l 2 d 3 l 3 t where cβ cosβ and sβ sinβ f is a vector consisting of six force components of the three oscillating fins β is the direction of flow impinging on the oscillating fins relative to the vertical axis y axis for the caudal fin and z axis for the pectoral fin γ is the angular position of the fin relative to the vertical axis and α is the angle of attack in which the direction of flow relative to the fin is calculated as α β γ the subscript 1 in matrix b indicates the angle corresponding to the caudal fin and the subscript 2 and 3 indicates the angles corresponding to the starboard pectoral fin and the port pectoral fin respectively the components d 1 l 1 is the drag and lift components of the thrust forces of the caudal fin and d 2 l 2 d 3 and l 3 are the drag and lift components of the thrust forces of the starboard and port side pectoral fins respectively the frames attached to the fins in the body fixed frame are shown in fig 12 thus the lift and drag forces are transformed into forces in the inertial frame of reference and expressed as f x d i sin β i l i cos β i f z o r f y l i sin β i d i cos β i the total propulsive force along the x b y b and z b axis is the sum of the three propulsive forces by the caudal fin and the pectoral fins the components of the total propulsive force are given by equation 10 10 f x j 1 3 d j sin β j l j cos β j f z o r f y j 1 3 l j sin β j d j cos β j the total propulsive moment at the cog about the x b y b and z b axis is the sum of the moments generated by the six propulsive forces given by equation 11 11 m x j 1 3 y j l j sin β j d j cos β j m y j 1 3 x j l j sin β j d j cos β j z j d j sin β j l j cos β j m z j 1 3 y j d j sin β j l j cos β j based on the frame orientation as shown in fig 12 we consider f z m z 0 for the caudal fin and f y m y 0 for the pectoral fin a control strategy is applied to this model for a trajectory tracking using these equations as discussed in the forthcoming sections 4 5 motion control design and gain optimization the configuration of a pd controller is described in this section for the hpurv to track the desired trajectory in general a control system needs good robustness to cope up with uncertainties like noise and disturbances and stabilize the vehicle at the desired position and follow the desired trajectory with a reasonable error however the control of the robot is done by the inverse dynamics where the control inputs thrust forces are estimated to produce the desired motion from equation 12 a conventional pd controller is used for the control of a current model of hpurv pd controllers perform moderately well when the gains are appropriately tuned however it is essential to retune the gains for desired performances which are time dependent or the operating conditions of the system vary santhakumar and asokan 2010 in this study a three dimensional trajectory for vehicle tracking control is used for tuning the gains and later to follow the path using the optimized gains choosing control input τ c with k p and k d are the control gains the control equation can be written in the form below 12 τ c j t η k p η k d η where η η d η η d is the desired position and orientation vector expressed in the earth fixed frame η is the tracking error and ν denotes the error in velocity shown in the body fixed frame from equation 9 we get the force vector as in equation 13 13 f b 1 j t η k p η k d η where b 1 is inverse of the thrust force matrix b the accelerations are calculated from the torque vector in the body fixed frame using equation 14 to solve this equation m should be an invertible matrix considering the accelerations of the vehicle with respect to the body fixed frame we have 14 ν m 1 τ c ν ν d ν ν g η after integration we have the velocity of the vehicle in the body fixed frame which is mapped into the earth fixed frame by using the equation 2 choosing appropriate values for gain constants k p and k d is essential for assurance of stability and improvement of the performance of trajectory following as shown below 4 5 1 reference trajectory generation motion along x b y b and z b directions are named surge sway and heave respectively the reference trajectory is chosen to have a contribution of the surge sway and heave with robot initially at rest and follows the trajectory with a finite velocity the profile is an infinity shaped trajectory which is composed of two sine curves with an amplitude of 2 m where the initial point of one curve is the ending point of the other the starting point of the robot is at the origin of the earth fixed frame and simulation results are presented in fig 13 typical simulation results are presented to demonstrate and validate the performance and effectiveness of the proposed control strategy the early error in position and orientation is a vital concern in any underwater vehicle control when the controller is switched on in general underwater vehicles are deployed from a mother ship where there is a chance of a considerable amount of error in the position and orientation at the initial stages in general the response of the closed loop system is instantaneous but an attempt towards realistic simulation is made using an increasing function as an exponential function a response function r is multiplied with the thrust force vector for an exponential rise in thrust the response function r in equation 15 force the thrusters to attain 90 of maximum thrust force in 5 s 15 response function r 0 9 1 e 0 5 t 4 5 2 results after considering these modifications the thrust forces for infinity profile are plotted in fig 15 this time depends on the initial tracking error maximum thrust force and thrust delay it is observed that due to these high initial tracking errors the time for eliminating initial tracking error is found to be 5 8 s and can also be observed in the tracking error plots as presented in fig 14 from fig 14 it is seen that the position error is maximum in the sway direction i e along with the y b direction the orientation error is maximum in the yaw direction i e about the z b axis this behavior is naturally attributed to the vehicle response because of the oscillating fin motion about the z b axis it can be observed that large thrust forces are needed at the beginning of the motion due to large initial tracking errors due to these high initial tracking errors the thrust forces increase exponentially to a maximum value of 58n initially and later decreases to less than 10n to eliminate the error it is also observed in fig 16 the vehicle tries to achieve the required trajectory with the optimum gains in the first 5 8 s later which the vehicle tracks the required path with reasonable accuracy the simulation study conducted for the hpurv is wholly based on the fin propulsion for achieving the required trajectory similarly the glider and the profiler modes of operation can be proved which depends on the buoyancy variation of the vehicle and moving mass actuation 5 system design and identification 5 1 variable buoyancy module it is a well known fact that the density of seawater varies with temperature salinity and depth which are generally measured using in situ conductivity temperature and depth ctd measurements in different locations of oceans the variation of the density profile is different in different seas of the world we have considered a fit of a fourth degree in equation 16 to describe the seawater density based on depth based information from yang et al 2017 as shown below 16 ρ p 1 d 4 p 2 d 3 p 3 d 2 p 4 d p 5 where d is the depth of the operation and p i is the values of fitting coefficients i 1 5 the aluminium reinforcements of hpurv hull made of gfrp acts as stiffeners to the hull assembly sealed with o rings which brings in the hull modularity and integrity the volume of the un deformed hull v ud is calculated using commercially available 3d modeling software and found to be approximately 0 013 m3 the volume of the hull v d under a given depth is given by equation 17 17 v d v u d δ v d where δv d is a reduction in the volume of the hull and is considered as a linear function of depth for initial estimations δ v d k d d here k d is compressibility of the hull and approximately equal to 0 9 mm3 m extrapolated from a cylindrical hull results made of gfrp the buoyancy variation of the submerged hull as shown in equation 18 is given by yang et al 2017 18 δ b d p 1 k d g d 5 p 1 v d p 2 k d g d 4 p 2 v d p 3 k d g d 3 p 3 v d p 4 k d g d 2 p 4 v d p 5 k d g d δb d is buoyancy variation of the hull and a function of depth the maximum buoyancy variation of the hpurv hull is 105 g for a depth of 50 m thus considering a factor two for each module to account for the extrapolation from the cylindrical gfrp hull used for the estimation of compressibility each variable buoyancy module is designed for a 220 g buoyancy change in 15 s of operation the actuator to drive the buoyancy module is chosen by considering the depth of operation lead screw and o ring frictional coefficients with a maximum torque of 50 kgf cm 5 2 moving mass mechanism the hpurv can change cog dynamically by moving an internal mass along xb axis and roll the same mass about the same and buoyancy variation using dual buoyancy module as observed in other hybrid vehicles alvarez et al 2009 caffaz et al 2012 with similar actuation principle buoyancy variation and internal mass motions and roll are to be slow compared to other system dynamics a quasi static cog approximation identical to that of the efolaga caffaz et al 2012 and other vehicles is considered for initial modeling where the shift of cog is at a slow speed compared to vehicle speed the actuator to drive the moving mass mechanism is chosen by considering the lead screw frictional coefficients with a maximum torque of 10 kgf cm the rate of the moving mass variation is found out to be 5 mm s which is very negligible compared to the velocity of the vehicle 5 3 optimum velocity maneuverability and autonomy of operation the hpurv can operate in two variants for thrust generation using a caudal fin in one option and a vectored thruster in the other the comparison of the stability and the maneuverability of the two variants are essential to understanding the vehicle characteristics the maneuverability is defined as the inverse of the power consumption of motors normalized with respect to the third power of the velocity of the vehicle pugi et al 2018 based on this approach it is understood that the maneuvering capability of the vectored thrust vehicle is better compared to the fixed thrust model which is similar to the caudal fin actuated variant in our case in the caudal fin variant the propulsion as well as the yaw motion is coupled which makes the vectored thrust variant better maneuverable at the cost of an extra input for the same dof achieved this is again a choice to be made based on the requirement i e the efficiency or the maneuverability another interesting understanding analogous to hpurv development is the stability of the vehicle during the rolling motion when the moving mass is rolled this case would require active stabilization by using the pectoral fins when the pectoral fins as passive they act as stabilizing fins for roll stabilization the total power required by the vehicle w total is the sum of propulsive power w prop and the energy consumed by the subsystems such as the onboard computer instruments and payload w sub the propulsive power directly depends on vehicle velocity the velocity of the vehicle and heading affects energy consumption which in turn affects the endurance autonomy and efficiency thus the approximation of optimum vehicle velocity is required to be evaluated to minimize energy consumption the optimum vehicle velocity allotta et al 2015 is given by equation 19 in terms of the module of the vehicle linear speed v 1 provided by v 1 2 u 2 v 2 w 2 19 v o p t 1 3 w s u b 2 f u v 1 v v 1 w v 1 at an optimum velocity v opt the electrical power for propulsion is found allotta et al 2015 as a linear relationship between energy consumed by propulsive systems w prop and onboard subsystems w sub as seen in equation 20 the optimum velocity v opt of many existing vehicles is around 3 to 5 knots 20 w p r o p 0 33 w t o t a l 0 5 w s u b based on the above discussion the efficiency of the caudal fin variant depends on the power consumed by the rigid or flexible fin when compared to the thruster variant a power management system is required when the thrusters based and caudal fin based systems are tested for performance characteristics if the fin arrangement underperforms in thrust generation or the efficiency when compared to the conventional thruster we can eliminate an additional power management system to choose one of the two variants thus the based on the requirements of efficiency maneuverability payload and autonomy of the vehicle the propulsive system can be chosen apriori for the deployment 6 concluding remarks this article has presented a new hybrid propulsion underwater robotic vehicle wherein the different forms of propulsion strategies are implemented in the same vehicle for their performance comparison to improve the endurance of the vehicle based on these hybrid strategies the hull shape of the hpurv is inspired by boxfish carapace to exploit its stability and maneuverability characteristics unlike most unmanned underwater vehicles which utilize conventional off the shelf propellers for thrust the hpurv uses a single fin ostraciiform propulsion strategy for simplicity in design and control and to reduce the mechanical losses the vehicle is also fitted with conventional thrusters to compare the performance of the hpurv in both the propulsion modes different modes of actuation mechanisms such as the variable buoyancy module moving mass mechanism and pectoral fins are implemented for vertical and horizontal motion and pitching motion these actuation mechanisms help the hpurv to operate in three different propulsion modes i e profiler mode auv and glider mode wherein each method are discussed in detail including their operational flowchart later a dynamic model of a 6 degrees of freedom dof underwater vehicle was developed based on the hydrodynamics of the system with six controllable inputs to define the position and orientation assuming the vehicle is neutrally buoyant the restoring effects are neglected and the cob coincides with the cog this assumption leads to only auv mode without considering the glider and profiler mode an oscillating rigid fin model was developed and used for simulation based on the four quadrants dynamic response for the generation of gait a motion control scheme using a pd controller for tracking a reference trajectory of infinity profile was implemented by considering the thrust delay to arrive at realistic results system identification of variable buoyancy module and moving mass mechanism was attempted to achieve the actuator sizing and operation parameters later a condensed index of the optimum velocity of operation to minimize energy consumption for improved efficiency maneuverability larger payload and more extended autonomy of the vehicle was discussed operational limitations hpurv is a modular hybrid vehicle targeted to overcome the practical limitations during the deployment in real time this development aims to change the operational characteristics based on the user need hpurv can operate as a mission mode auv glider and as a profiler based on the requirement most of the significant limitations of different types of vehicles used for ocean observations have been addressed nevertheless the vehicle operation in any particular mode of operation does not provide a station keeping capability which of course is not a direct requirement concerning observation class vehicles is concerned a prototype development to test and validate these hybrid propulsion strategies based on different actuation mechanisms individually and as a combination thereof is underway this methodology as a commercial application can be seen in both underwater robotics and ocean observations and the success and availability of these hybridized systems would attract the scientific community oceanographers geologists etc for improved observation capabilities acknowledgment this work was partially supported by the department of higher education ministry of human resource

22794,the proposed design named as the hybrid propulsion underwater robotic vehicle hpurv is a novel underwater vehicle with a hybridized propulsion for minimum energy consumption in ocean observations this development is aimed at the comparison of different types of propulsion techniques in both vertical and horizontal directions of the motion to choose an optimum strategy for propulsion the horizontal motion is achieved using the bio inspired method of fish propulsion using caudal fin or a pair of pectoral fins or both the tail design is made modular such that the caudal fin can be replaced by a conventional miniature thruster to understand the performance characteristics of the vehicle under similar operating conditions the diving climbing pitching and rolling motions are achieved using three different mechanisms for viz 1 pitch and dive using pectoral fins 2 pitch and dive by varying buoyancy of the vehicle and 3 pitch dive and roll by using a moving mass and a rolling mass mechanisms respectively all these mechanisms are assembled in the same vehicle and controlled independently or using a combination of two or more different mechanisms for the performance comparison of the vehicle in similar operating conditions this paper also presents a dynamic model of the hpurv and a motion control scheme using a conventional proportional derivative pd control technique to track a given complex spatial trajectory keywords underwater vehicle hybrid propulsion system bio inspired systems underwater glider buoyancy engine fin propulsion 1 introduction the conventional observation techniques from research vessels in the deep sea incur huge expenditures because of operational costs and unavailability of ships during required times generally research cruises last not more than a month or two and observations may also halt during hostile weather conditions these operational issues and uncertainties are limiting the detailed ocean s monitoring davis et al 2002 ironically ocean variability does not wait for the research vessels to reach the location for observations this limited sampling of the ocean and the relatively costly conventional observation platforms has made the scientific community think and develop low cost technologies that provide better endurance through both the spatial and temporal scales the ocean observation platforms are broadly classified based on the application and operational characteristics as in situ observations using sensors mounted on ships buoys moorings coastal stations etc and remote sensing observations such as aircraft radar and satellite etc the in situ measurements have progressed through ages due to the advanced observation strategies and equipment they provide highly accurate and excellent resolution data compared to remote sensing observations the in situ ocean observation platforms are further broadly classified as shipboard fixed and mobile platforms as shown in fig 1 the evolution of these observation platforms has laid great emphasis on improving the quality and endurance of measurements observations thus leading to the development of unmanned systems such as deep sea and coastal moorings mounted with sensors instruments for continuous sampling of many ocean properties moored buoys are one of the most common and cost effective means to obtain oceanographic data but the moorings can provide data only in temporal scale so a vast network of moorings have to be deployed for spatial scale observations this limitation was overcome by using mobile unmanned platforms such as remotely operable semi autonomous and autonomous systems for both surface and sub surface measurements remotely operable vehicle rov is a remote controlled underwater robot tethered to a mothership or any other floating platform on the surface that provide power and control communication signal to the vehicle thus making it a suitable for complicated underwater operations as far as ocean observations are concerned the rovs limit the range of observations due to limited tether length and require an ample power supply to propel the rov as the most percentage of power is consumed in overcoming the drag of the tether the rov operations for ocean observations are limited to the order of days due to the available ship time for the operation however untethered vehicles such as an autonomous underwater vehicle auv depend on the onboard power supply battery with its built in intelligence to execute its mission by drifting cruising or glide through the ocean humphris 2010 with speed ranging from 0 5 m s to 2 5 m s the advantage of auvs over rovs is their endurance where propeller driven vehicles typically operate in the order of 8 50 h von alt 2003 and buoyancy propelled vehicles such as underwater gliders and floats can run in the order of months in transoceanic ranges creating a large amount of data sampling at the expense of limited transit speeds ranging from 0 15 m s to 0 25 m s webb et al 2001 the floats drift through the ocean currents for measurements whose location of the sampling is unfeasible to control whereas the gliders assured this control to a certain extent over the region of interest to be sampled but navigation of gliders in regions of strong current affects the observational capability due to the ineffective vehicle maneuverability also the gliders perform well in a vertical plane but the operations in horizontal directions are significantly affected due to the saw tooth pattern principle thus leading to operational constraints in a horizontal plane or in shallow regions or near shallow regions where the depth of observational water column is small gliders with low transit speeds and sluggish response for navigation combined with the propeller power offers a relatively better endurance and capability to overcome strong current chen et al 2016 but the thruster efficiency is observed to be not more than 40 percent triantafyllou and triantafyllou 1995 tzeranis et al 2006 whereas implementing bio inspired swimming techniques can help to outperform conventional thruster based auvs in the areas of maneuverability and control authority bandyopadhyay 2005 in this regard the present development of hpurv is attempted as a combination of buoyancy and bio inspired propulsion strategies to improve the vehicle efficiency during ocean observations using two different propulsion techniques in the same vehicle and intermittently to switch between the propulsion strategies based on the requirement 2 background and rationale behind the current development swimming methods of fish are various and interesting they do not have propellers and get along very well without them they are highly efficient and highly maneuverable at the same time also in the bio inspired propulsion the problem of cavitation during operation can be mitigated compared to the conventional propulsion systems like thrusters fish have many specialized modes of movement of fins and based on the same they are classified into anguilliform subcarangiform carangiform thunniform ostraciiform rajiform diodontiform amiiform gymnotiform balistiform labriform and tetraodontiform sfakiotakis et al 1999 the hpurv development is inspired by the boxfish which uses ostraciiform of propulsion it is believed that the boxfish propels by oscillating only a tail fin without affecting the body this belief was the traditional understanding of boxfish swimming technique until different biological studies hove et al 2001 showed that ostraciiform of swimming utilizes multiple fins than simply wagging the tail blake 1977 gordon et al 2000 bartol et al 2003 bartol 2005 have reported that the hull dynamics and construction of fish such as box fish carapace with keel structures leads to vortices forming around the keels that stabilize the boxfishes movements but a later study van wassenbergh et al 2014 showed that the front part of the boxfish carapace generates destabilizing forces that dominate the effect of the stabilizing vortices as shown in fig 2 these destabilizing forces provide the boxfish with significant maneuverability few other vehicles were also developed based on ostraciiform phenomenon viz boxybot lachat et al 2006 boxfish like robots wang and xie 2014 and micro autonomous robotic ostraciiform marco kodati et al 2008 but could not achieve the efficiencies as anticipated compared to that of the conventional thrusters required for long range applications it should be noted that the aim of the present research is not to mimic the exact characteristics of the boxfish but as an inspiration from boxfish swimming characteristics as far as the propulsion pitching and maneuverability issues are concerned different fish employ different strategies i e caudal fin pectoral fins dorsal fin and buoyancy variation etc many fish swim using their pectoral fins alone lauder and madden 2006 pectoral fins can make the fish maintain stability and help to swim up and down to some extent in fact even just for hovering fishes must oscillate their pectoral fins to correct its intrinsic instability lauder and madden 2006 due to these advantages of the pectoral fins the hpurv is equipped with pectoral fins for the present development few fishes control their buoyancy in the water by finely controlling its volume making it possible to travel up and down in the water an organ known as a swim bladder allows the fish to quickly adjust its density relative to its surroundings by changing the volume of the bladder some underwater robots employ piston mechanisms to ballast the submersible low 2006 in line with the current requirement of better endurance unmanned vehicles such as underwater gliders use buoyancy based propulsion inspired from the fish and act as a virtual mooring for ocean observations meyer 2016 where the speed and the vehicle response are limited generally buoyancy propulsion is an intermittent operation and the variable buoyancy module is operated during the start and end of the ascent or descent of the vehicle this advantage makes the buoyancy propulsion an efficient technique with limited speeds almost all the commercial gliders utilize moving mass mechanism for both pitch and roll successfully the same has been attempted in the hpurv considering the advantages and limitations of each propulsion strategy the hpurv is conceptualized using a combination of the above discussed techniques to assist the vehicle performance in terms of speed and response whenever required here the word hybrid refers to the combination of two or more distinct features of conventional system or process and the term system can refer an unmanned vehicle and the term process refers to a vehicle control procedure in the underwater robotics domain based on the application and utility there are many different interpretations but the term hybrid is commonly interpreted as a vehicle which can operate both as an auv and an rov based on the performance requirement and thus utilize the advantages of auv and rov moore et al 2010 nereus is one such example of hybrid unmanned autonomous underwater vehicles developed by the woods hole oceanographic institution whoi which could operate at depths of up to 11000m bowen et al 2008 few hybrid vehicles chen et al 2016 claus 2009 claus et al 2010 isa et al 2014 yang et al 2016 alvarez et al 2009 in line with current development have been developed as a combination of buoyancy and propeller based propulsion similarly a hybrid underwater glider in combination with fin based thrust zhang et al 2014 li et al 2018 is designed to exploit energy efficient locomotion in gliding and a bio inspired fin for better maneuverability considering the possible criterion for ocean observation and exploration the proposed design of hpurv is aimed at evaluation of different types of propulsion techniques in both vertical and horizontal directions of the motion to choose an optimum strategy for propulsion all the propulsion strategies are adapted in the same vehicle and switching among these techniques whenever required would help first understand and later improve the vehicle performance 3 design overview the hpurv comprises a pressure hull housing electrical and electronic components and sub components a dual buoyancy controlling module is placed at the fore and aft of the hull for buoyancy propulsion two direct current dc servo motors with position feedback are used for caudal fin and pectoral fin actuation a pitch roll moving mass mechanism comprises of a linear actuator for linear motion of the mass and a third dc servo motor for rolling the mass a rechargeable battery unit provides the power supply to all the electrical subsystems and an onboard microcontroller with data storage capability is programmed to control different modes of operation of the vehicle the pressure hull is fabricated in shape comparable to that of boxfish as shown in fig 3 and the design overview of each of the subsystems are detailed below 3 1 hull the pressure hull of the hpurv is made up of glass fiber reinforced plastic gfrp sealed and rated to dive up to a depth of 30 m as shown in fig 4 it is hydrodynamically streamlined to a shape of boxfish carapace and assembled with caudal fin and pair of pectoral fins the hull comprises mainly three parts viz free flooding nose at the bow sealed chamber in the middle for the assembly of all subsystems and stern sealed chamber for caudal fin actuator the middle chamber is made up into two halves for ease of assembly with aluminium reinforcements at each end to mount o rings for sealing and to provide stiffness to the hull during assembly openings are provided in the nose and stern bulkheads made of aluminium to fit the buoyancy cylinders and for mounting penetrators and connectors 3 2 fins and thruster dc servo motors are used to actuate the caudal fin and a pair of pectoral fins using sealed shafts the dc servo motor of the caudal fin is an independent module attached to the vehicle where the caudal fin can be replaced with a thruster of same power output for performance comparison of the thruster based and the caudal fin based propulsion under similar conditions as shown in fig 5 another dc servo motor is used to actuate the pair of pectoral fins to generate flapping motion i e thrust generation as well pitching the pectoral fins provide a sawtooth profile for gliding at a particular angle of attack and thrust generation during flapping the hpurv can also perform active pitch control for change of effective glide angles by using the pectoral fins as control surfaces 3 3 variable buoyancy vb module two buoyancy control modules are placed at forward and aft of the vehicle to form a dual buoyancy controlling module for changing the buoyancy as shown in fig 6 the two buoyancy controlling modules comprise linear actuators to move a set of plungers in both forward and aft buoyancy modules the forward buoyancy module is to glide profile in the water column and the aft buoyancy module is used for pre dive autonomous ballasting based on the change in the payload for a particular mission the redundant reserve buoyancy of the vehicle enables the vehicle to operate at a broader range of densities from lighter fresh water to dense saline water yang et al 2017 3 4 pitch roll moving mass mechanism a pitch roll moving mass mechanism as shown in fig 7 comprises a linear actuator and a dc servo motor to drive a mass along the longitudinal axis of the vehicle and rolls the same mass about the same axis the mass used here is a dense metal deadweight the pitch of the vehicle is achieved by moving the mass along the axis of the vehicle whereas the roll of the vehicle is made by rolling the same mass for a particular pitch angle about the longitudinal axis these motions are achieved without actuating the caudal fin or the pair of pectoral fins during the gliding motion 3 5 power control and communication the power to the hybrid vehicle is provided by a battery unit placed inside the pressure hull an onboard controller with data storage capability is programmed to control different modes of operation of the vehicle such as an autonomous underwater vehicle mode auv mode a glider mode and a vertical profiler mode which are discussed in the next section the controller takes the decision based on the requirement of the user or through the preprogrammed codes the controller is programmed to abort the current missions by surfacing in case of an emergency such as if the hpurv dives beyond a prescribed depth the vehicle is manually switched on by using an external switch and a particular mission mode is chosen using wired communication during the start of the mission 3 6 operation overview the swimming actions like surge pitch and yaw at a particular angle in both semi autonomous and autonomous modes are to be achieved for which a control system and algorithm needs to developed which would help the hpurv in required path planning and perform the above activities it is proposed to check the feasibility of the control system for three different types of operational strategies and an optimized system would be chosen based on the simulation results the final version of fish would be tested for hydrodynamic response with the help of tank tests the three basic modes of actuation are chosen for mathematical modeling and would be simulated each at a time and arrive at the optimized output three design modes are given below as shown in fig 8 pitch or vertical motion control by using pectoral fins pitch or vertical motion control by using the moving mass mechanism pitch or vertical motion control by varying buoyancy the final control strategy would be decided based on any of the three modes or a combination of at least two modes of operation based on the optimization results from the models developed apart from having three different modes of actuation mechanisms the hpurv operates in three different propulsion modes such as a vertical profiler mode an autonomous underwater vehicle mode auv mode and an underwater glider mode as shown in fig 9 the vertical profiler mode provides vertical profiling motion and the glider mode includes saw tooth profiling motion and the auv mode includes the spatial movement of the vehicle commercially available radio frequency r f module is placed inside the hybrid underwater vehicle and configured to communicate with the control center either on a mother ship or from a floating platform this communication is done for monitoring the vehicle on the surface during the launch and recovery the underwater communication is done using acoustic sensors after the deployment when the vehicle is under operation as shown in fig 9 the r f modules receive one or more commands from an external remote controller to choose a mission for the underwater vehicle from the already preloaded mission modes the preloaded mission modes are already programmed in the microcontroller the vehicle can also be manually switched on by using the pressure rated switch on the vehicle and choosing a particular mission mode from the external system using wired communication 3 6 1 vertical profiler mode it is a mode for vertical climbing and diving similar to that of underwater profiler madhan et al 2012 zhu et al 2015 the moving mass is shifted forward or backward in such a way that the center of gravity cog of the vehicle shifts to the forward or aft extreme thus pitching the vehicle to a vertical position with nose down after reaching the vertical position the negative buoyancy in the buoyancy module initiates the downward profiling similarly when the moving mass is moved to aft extreme the vehicle again pitches to a vertical position with the nose up now with positive buoyancy in the buoyancy module the vehicle starts the upward profiling in this operation the vehicle pitch is changed initially using the moving mass and later the buoyancy is varied based on the requirement of the direction of profiling this provides the profiling of oceanographic parameters along the depth without any glide angle 3 6 2 auv mode it operates based on the thrust generated using either or both types of fins caudal fin or pectoral fins and the dual buoyancy controlling module this mode can perform a combination of complex motions which includes maneuvering cruising yawing and motions that cannot be performed in the profiler and the glider modes 3 6 3 underwater glider mode it includes a saw tooth profile of vehicle by using buoyancy propulsion and control surfaces for an effective change of glide angles the positive buoyancy of the vehicle provides the climbing motion and the negative buoyancy provides the diving motion by adjusting the variable buoyancy module the forward gliding motion of hpurv is achieved by exploiting the lift force generated from the fins the effective glide angle is varied by either using the pectoral fins as active wings or by shifting the cog using moving mass mechanism similar to that of convention underwater gliders fig 10 shows a flowchart for the operational procedure of hpurv in three different modes the vehicle is started by manual mode or by using an r f module remotely later the onboard controller checks the health status of all the components and subsystems and updates the controller whether to start the mission or stop the mission if the health status is signaled bad after the successful health check of the components and subsystems the sensors are calibrated based on the attitude of the vehicle thus correcting the vehicle attitude by ballasting and trimming the vehicle as required for the mission the operation mode of the hpurv is chosen from the user input in the profiler mode first mode of operation based on the requirement of the user or through command read the roll pitch moving mass mechanism is actuated and shifts the mass to forward or to aft until the vehicle is vertical along the longitudinal axis the buoyancy module is actuated for either positive buoyancy or negative buoyancy after the vehicle achieves the vertical position for surfacing or diving respectively due to the change in buoyancy the vehicle moves towards the required position and a depth sensor continuously measures the current position depth of the vehicle the mission stops after the vehicle reaches the required position otherwise the controller initiates an emergency mode when the depth of the vehicle more than the permissible depth during diving to avoid loss of the vehicle the second mode of operation is the auv mode wherein the vehicle operates in mission mode preprogrammed as per the user requirement or in emergency mode for the recovery of the vehicle for keeping the vehicle in failsafe condition the third mode of operation is the glider mode wherein the process is similar to that of the profiler mode based on the requirement of the user or through command read the roll pitch moving mass mechanism is actuated and shifts the mass to forward or to aft until the vehicle reaches its required pitch angle after the vehicle achieves the angle of pitch needed the buoyancy module is actuated for either positive buoyancy or negative buoyancy for the required sawtooth pattern the mission stops after the vehicle reaches the required position the controller initiates the emergency mode as similar to that in the profiler mode in fig 10 4 dynamic modeling of the hpurv 4 1 vehicle design the operational workspace of a 6 degrees of freedom dof underwater vehicle at any given instant of time requires six controllable inputs to define the position and orientation an underactuated underwater system is a vehicle with fewer than six inputs whereas an overactuated system is a vehicle with a higher number of inputs to operate in 6 dof space the design proposed here consists of three oscillating fins which can be tilted independently using servomotors two buoyancy modules actuated using two dc motors and moving mass mechanism using a dc and servomotor for different motions the model developed here is overactuated with seven inputs for getting a controlled output in five dof excluding the sway motion the oscillating fins provide three inputs as thrust force for surge yaw and pitch two inputs are supplied by the dc motors to the buoyancy modules to provide heave and pitch two more inputs are provided to the moving mass mechanism to provide pitch and roll the hull shape is inspired by boxfish carapace with three oscillating fins the fins are placed such that one caudal fin in x z plane and two pectoral fins thrusters in x y plane both in the body fixed frame the underwater robot model presented in this paper is a combination of three fins and one rigid hull the geometrical and physical parameters of the model are displayed in table 1 4 2 assumptions a few sound assumptions were contemplated for the sake of simplicity in mathematical modeling the vehicle is considered as a rigid body with constant mass the shape of the robot has three planes of symmetry thus the off diagonal elements of the moment of inertia are neglected it is rudimentarily assumed that the robot is neutrally buoyant and the center of buoyancy coincides with the center of gravity though this is not true for the glider mode of operation lift forces can be neglected as the vehicle moves at a very slow speed the external disturbances such as ocean currents wind forces on the surface density changes and wave dynamics acting on the robot are neglected the accelerations of the underwater robot due to motion about a curved rotating earth are negligible and acceleration due to gravity is constant and is quantified as 9 81 m s2 the tuned gains are chosen as identical for the position vector η 1 and orientation vector η 2 presented in the next section 4 3 preliminary definitions two coordinate frames are defined for the analysis of the motion of the underwater vehicle the moving coordinate frame or the body fixed frame x b y b z b fixed to the center of mass of the robot whose motion is expressed relative to an inertial frame xyz as shown in fig 11 fossen 1994 the x b axis is positive

angular velocities vector of the body fixed frame with respect to earth fixed frame expressed in the body fixed frame the force torque vector τ of the thruster input is given by τ x y z k m n t 4 4 equations of motion the dynamic model of the underwater vehicle is developed through the euler lagrange formulation using the principle of virtual work and d alembert s principle the equations of motion of the underwater vehicle model in general are written with respect to the body fixed frame governed by fossen 1994 as shown in equations 1 and 2 dynamic equations of motion 1 m ν c ν ν d ν ν g

forces and moments due to gravity and buoyancy τ denotes the generalized forces and moments on the vehicle expressed in the body fixed frame j η is a jacobian matrix which transforms velocity from the body fixed frame to the earth fixed frame here the matrix j η is expressed in terms of the euler angles in equation 3 for a rigid body in space it can be represented as fossen 1994 3 j η c ψ c θ s ψ c

sinθ tθ tanθ here the number of degrees of freedom and generalized coordinates is equal to the number of rows and number of columns respectively craig 2005 4 4 1 mass matrix the mass matrix or the inertia tensor represents the mass distribution of the rigid body composed of a rigid body and added mass terms as seen in equation 4 the rigid body term m rb consists of the mass mass moment of inertia and mass product of inertia there exists a frame called principle frame where the inertia matrix attains a diagonal form as it is symmetric and positive definite vervoort 2009 4 m m r b m a the term m a is the inertia contribution due to added mass and the terms of the added mass matrix are dependent on the shape of the underwater robot which is approximated to a rectangular parallelepiped for initial modeling the added mass is the ﬂuid surrounding the body being accelerated where a force is necessary to achieve this acceleration while the ﬂuid exerts a reaction force equal in magnitude and opposite in direction mohan and thondiyath 2011 the hydrodynamic added mass can be simplified into a diagonal matrix as the robot has three planes of symmetry moves at low speed and the center of gravity is positioned at the origin of the body fixed frame the off diagonal elements of the added mass matrix are neglected antonelli et al 2008 m a d i a g a 11 a 22 a 33 a 44 a 55 a 66 the added mass forces and moments can be derived by applying potential theory fossen 1994 newman 1977 this method is based on the assumptions of an inviscid fluid no circulation and the body is completely submerged in an unbounded liquid and the added mass coefficients are constant the added mass and inertia terms can be derived numerically by strip theory fossen 1994 newman 1977 dong 1978 triantafyllou and hover 2003 the six coefficients of added mass and inertia matrix can be derived by considering the shape of the vehicle to be a rectangular parallelepiped the resulting equations inertia matrix m is constant speed independent and positive deﬁnite m m t 0 ṁ 0 as shown in equation 5 thus the mass matrix is estimated as in jin et al 2015 georgiades 2005 5 m 13 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 35 3

mass terms where c rb ν is the rigid body term and c a ν is the added mass term coriolis terms are the components of the matrix c ij where i j and the remaining terms are due to centripetal forces c ν can always be parameterized such that it is skew symmetrical for a rigid body moving through an ideal fluid 6 c ν c r b ν c a ν the coefficients of the hydrodynamic coriolis and centripetal matrix can be derived from strip theory as well the explicit expressions for c rb ν and c a ν is found in fossen 1994 the coriolis and the centripetal matrix is estimated as jin et al 2015 is shown in equation 7

the hydrodynamic damping of underwater vehicles depends on potential viscous and wave drift damping skin friction and vortex shedding damping detailed information on the same is found in fossen 1994 triantafyllou and hover 2003 the dissipative forces due to viscosity are composed of drag and lift forces the drags are the only forces responsible for damping as the lift produced and disturbances are considered negligible as the auv moves at low speed the hydrodynamic damping terms are approximated to a non coupled diagonal matrix composed of drag force fossen 1994 the drag coefficients for angular velocities are estimated using an analytical approach georgiades 2005 the damping matrix d ν is determined newman 1977 considering only quadratic terms such that d ν 0 ν r6 the damping matrix is shown in equation 8 for the proposed model 8 d ν 0 97 u 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 08 v 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 38 w 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 004 p 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 004 q 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 05 r 4 4 4 restoring effects in the underwater environment the gravitation and buoyant forces work as restoring forces and moments the expression for g η is shown in fossen 1994 gravity and buoyancy vector can be negligible since the vehicle is neutrally buoyant and center of gravity and center of buoyancy coincide 4 4 5 dynamics of rigid fin thrust for swimming gait thrusters are generally used for propulsion and control of conventional underwater vehicles the hpurv uses control surfaces or oscillating rigid fins for thrust production and control the oscillating fin model used for simulation in the current study is adapted from the work on the four quadrants dynamic response of conventional auv thrusters and the hexapod robot model using rigid fin for the generation of gait georgiades 2005 the fin thrust model consists of two pectoral fins and one caudal fin that oscillate about a yb axis and zb axis in the body fixed frame respectively the relationship between the force moment acting on the vehicle τ and the control input of the fins f is nonlinear due to the presence of the oscillating angle is shown in equation 9 it is a function of some structural variables such as the density of the water the body fin cross sectional area the fin length the volumetric ﬂow rate through the fin oscillation vervoort 2009 b matrix is not time invariant that maps the horizontal and vertical components of thrust force vector f to generalized forces moment vectors τ both expressed in the body fixed frame 9 τ b f here b s β 1 c β 1 s β 2 c β 2 s β 3 c β 3 s β 1 c β 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 s β 2 c β 2 s β 3 c β 3 z 1 c β 1 z 1 s β 1 y 2

s β 3 y 3 c β 3 and f d 1 l 1 d 2 l 2 d 3 l 3 t where cβ cosβ and sβ sinβ f is a vector consisting of six force components of the three oscillating fins β is the direction of flow impinging on the oscillating fins relative to the vertical axis y axis for the caudal fin and z axis for the pectoral fin γ is the angular position of the fin relative to the vertical axis and α is the angle of attack in which the direction of flow relative to the fin is calculated as α β γ the subscript 1 in matrix b indicates the angle corresponding to the caudal fin and the subscript 2 and 3 indicates the angles corresponding to the starboard pectoral fin and the port pectoral fin respectively the components d 1 l 1 is the drag and lift components of the thrust forces of the caudal fin and d 2 l 2 d 3 and l 3 are the drag and lift components of the thrust forces of the starboard and port side pectoral fins respectively the frames attached to the fins in the body fixed frame are shown in fig 12 thus the lift and drag forces are transformed into forces in the inertial frame of reference and expressed as f x d i sin β i l i cos β i f z o r f y l i sin β i d i cos β i the total propulsive force along the x b y b and z b axis is the sum of the three propulsive forces by the caudal fin and the pectoral fins the components of the total propulsive force are given by equation 10 10 f x j 1 3 d j sin β j l j cos β j f z o r f y j 1 3 l j sin β j d j cos β j the total propulsive moment at the cog about the x b y b and z b axis is the sum of the moments generated by the six propulsive forces given by equation 11 11 m x j 1 3 y j l j sin β j d j cos β j m y j 1 3 x j l j sin β j d j cos β j z j d j sin β j l j cos β j m z j 1 3 y j d j sin β j l j cos β j based on the frame orientation as shown in fig 12 we consider f z m z 0 for the caudal fin and f y m y 0 for the pectoral fin a control strategy is applied to this model for a trajectory tracking using these equations as discussed in the forthcoming sections 4 5 motion control design and gain optimization the configuration of a pd controller is described in this section for the hpurv to track the desired trajectory in general a control system needs good robustness to cope up with uncertainties like noise and disturbances and stabilize the vehicle at the desired position and follow the desired trajectory with a reasonable error however the control of the robot is done by the inverse dynamics where the control inputs thrust forces are estimated to produce the desired motion from equation 12 a conventional pd controller is used for the control of a current model of hpurv pd controllers perform moderately well when the gains are appropriately tuned however it is essential to retune the gains for desired performances which are time dependent or the operating conditions of the system vary santhakumar and asokan 2010 in this study a three dimensional trajectory for vehicle tracking control is used for tuning the gains and later to follow the path using the optimized gains choosing control input τ c with k p and k d are the control gains the control equation can be written in the form below 12 τ c j t η k p η k d η where η η d η η d is the desired position and orientation vector expressed in the earth fixed frame η is the tracking error and ν denotes the error in velocity shown in the body fixed frame from equation 9 we get the force vector as in equation 13 13 f b 1 j t η k p η k d η where b 1 is inverse of the thrust force matrix b the accelerations are calculated from the torque vector in the body fixed frame using equation 14 to solve this equation m should be an invertible matrix considering the accelerations of the vehicle with respect to the body fixed frame we have 14 ν m 1 τ c ν ν d ν ν g η after integration we have the velocity of the vehicle in the body fixed frame which is mapped into the earth fixed frame by using the equation 2 choosing appropriate values for gain constants k p and k d is essential for assurance of stability and improvement of the performance of trajectory following as shown below 4 5 1 reference trajectory generation motion along x b y b and z b directions are named surge sway and heave respectively the reference trajectory is chosen to have a contribution of the surge sway and heave with robot initially at rest and follows the trajectory with a finite velocity the profile is an infinity shaped trajectory which is composed of two sine curves with an amplitude of 2 m where the initial point of one curve is the ending point of the other the starting point of the robot is at the origin of the earth fixed frame and simulation results are presented in fig 13 typical simulation results are presented to demonstrate and validate the performance and effectiveness of the proposed control strategy the early error in position and orientation is a vital concern in any underwater vehicle control when the controller is switched on in general underwater vehicles are deployed from a mother ship where there is a chance of a considerable amount of error in the position and orientation at the initial stages in general the response of the closed loop system is instantaneous but an attempt towards realistic simulation is made using an increasing function as an exponential function a response function r is multiplied with the thrust force vector for an exponential rise in thrust the response function r in equation 15 force the thrusters to attain 90 of maximum thrust force in 5 s 15 response function r 0 9 1 e 0 5 t 4 5 2 results after considering these modifications the thrust forces for infinity profile are plotted in fig 15 this time depends on the initial tracking error maximum thrust force and thrust delay it is observed that due to these high initial tracking errors the time for eliminating initial tracking error is found to be 5 8 s and can also be observed in the tracking error plots as presented in fig 14 from fig 14 it is seen that the position error is maximum in the sway direction i e along with the y b direction the orientation error is maximum in the yaw direction i e about the z b axis this behavior is naturally attributed to the vehicle response because of the oscillating fin motion about the z b axis it can be observed that large thrust forces are needed at the beginning of the motion due to large initial tracking errors due to these high initial tracking errors the thrust forces increase exponentially to a maximum value of 58n initially and later decreases to less than 10n to eliminate the error it is also observed in fig 16 the vehicle tries to achieve the required trajectory with the optimum gains in the first 5 8 s later which the vehicle tracks the required path with reasonable accuracy the simulation study conducted for the hpurv is wholly based on the fin propulsion for achieving the required trajectory similarly the glider and the profiler modes of operation can be proved which depends on the buoyancy variation of the vehicle and moving mass actuation 5 system design and identification 5 1 variable buoyancy module it is a well known fact that the density of seawater varies with temperature salinity and depth which are generally measured using in situ conductivity temperature and depth ctd measurements in different locations of oceans the variation of the density profile is different in different seas of the world we have considered a fit of a fourth degree in equation 16 to describe the seawater density based on depth based information from yang et al 2017 as shown below 16 ρ p 1 d 4 p 2 d 3 p 3 d 2 p 4 d p 5 where d is the depth of the operation and p i is the values of fitting coefficients i 1 5 the aluminium reinforcements of hpurv hull made of gfrp acts as stiffeners to the hull assembly sealed with o rings which brings in the hull modularity and integrity the volume of the un deformed hull v ud is calculated using commercially available 3d modeling software and found to be approximately 0 013 m3 the volume of the hull v d under a given depth is given by equation 17 17 v d v u d δ v d where δv d is a reduction in the volume of the hull and is considered as a linear function of depth for initial estimations δ v d k d d here k d is compressibility of the hull and approximately equal to 0 9 mm3 m extrapolated from a cylindrical hull results made of gfrp the buoyancy variation of the submerged hull as shown in equation 18 is given by yang et al 2017 18 δ b d p 1 k d g d 5 p 1 v d p 2 k d g d 4 p 2 v d p 3 k d g d 3 p 3 v d p 4 k d g d 2 p 4 v d p 5 k d g d δb d is buoyancy variation of the hull and a function of depth the maximum buoyancy variation of the hpurv hull is 105 g for a depth of 50 m thus considering a factor two for each module to account for the extrapolation from the cylindrical gfrp hull used for the estimation of compressibility each variable buoyancy module is designed for a 220 g buoyancy change in 15 s of operation the actuator to drive the buoyancy module is chosen by considering the depth of operation lead screw and o ring frictional coefficients with a maximum torque of 50 kgf cm 5 2 moving mass mechanism the hpurv can change cog dynamically by moving an internal mass along xb axis and roll the same mass about the same and buoyancy variation using dual buoyancy module as observed in other hybrid vehicles alvarez et al 2009 caffaz et al 2012 with similar actuation principle buoyancy variation and internal mass motions and roll are to be slow compared to other system dynamics a quasi static cog approximation identical to that of the efolaga caffaz et al 2012 and other vehicles is considered for initial modeling where the shift of cog is at a slow speed compared to vehicle speed the actuator to drive the moving mass mechanism is chosen by considering the lead screw frictional coefficients with a maximum torque of 10 kgf cm the rate of the moving mass variation is found out to be 5 mm s which is very negligible compared to the velocity of the vehicle 5 3 optimum velocity maneuverability and autonomy of operation the hpurv can operate in two variants for thrust generation using a caudal fin in one option and a vectored thruster in the other the comparison of the stability and the maneuverability of the two variants are essential to understanding the vehicle characteristics the maneuverability is defined as the inverse of the power consumption of motors normalized with respect to the third power of the velocity of the vehicle pugi et al 2018 based on this approach it is understood that the maneuvering capability of the vectored thrust vehicle is better compared to the fixed thrust model which is similar to the caudal fin actuated variant in our case in the caudal fin variant the propulsion as well as the yaw motion is coupled which makes the vectored thrust variant better maneuverable at the cost of an extra input for the same dof achieved this is again a choice to be made based on the requirement i e the efficiency or the maneuverability another interesting understanding analogous to hpurv development is the stability of the vehicle during the rolling motion when the moving mass is rolled this case would require active stabilization by using the pectoral fins when the pectoral fins as passive they act as stabilizing fins for roll stabilization the total power required by the vehicle w total is the sum of propulsive power w prop and the energy consumed by the subsystems such as the onboard computer instruments and payload w sub the propulsive power directly depends on vehicle velocity the velocity of the vehicle and heading affects energy consumption which in turn affects the endurance autonomy and efficiency thus the approximation of optimum vehicle velocity is required to be evaluated to minimize energy consumption the optimum vehicle velocity allotta et al 2015 is given by equation 19 in terms of the module of the vehicle linear speed v 1 provided by v 1 2 u 2 v 2 w 2 19 v o p t 1 3 w s u b 2 f u v 1 v v 1 w v 1 at an optimum velocity v opt the electrical power for propulsion is found allotta et al 2015 as a linear relationship between energy consumed by propulsive systems w prop and onboard subsystems w sub as seen in equation 20 the optimum velocity v opt of many existing vehicles is around 3 to 5 knots 20 w p r o p 0 33 w t o t a l 0 5 w s u b based on the above discussion the efficiency of the caudal fin variant depends on the power consumed by the rigid or flexible fin when compared to the thruster variant a power management system is required when the thrusters based and caudal fin based systems are tested for performance characteristics if the fin arrangement underperforms in thrust generation or the efficiency when compared to the conventional thruster we can eliminate an additional power management system to choose one of the two variants thus the based on the requirements of efficiency maneuverability payload and autonomy of the vehicle the propulsive system can be chosen apriori for the deployment 6 concluding remarks this article has presented a new hybrid propulsion underwater robotic vehicle wherein the different forms of propulsion strategies are implemented in the same vehicle for their performance comparison to improve the endurance of the vehicle based on these hybrid strategies the hull shape of the hpurv is inspired by boxfish carapace to exploit its stability and maneuverability characteristics unlike most unmanned underwater vehicles which utilize conventional off the shelf propellers for thrust the hpurv uses a single fin ostraciiform propulsion strategy for simplicity in design and control and to reduce the mechanical losses the vehicle is also fitted with conventional thrusters to compare the performance of the hpurv in both the propulsion modes different modes of actuation mechanisms such as the variable buoyancy module moving mass mechanism and pectoral fins are implemented for vertical and horizontal motion and pitching motion these actuation mechanisms help the hpurv to operate in three different propulsion modes i e profiler mode auv and glider mode wherein each method are discussed in detail including their operational flowchart later a dynamic model of a 6 degrees of freedom dof underwater vehicle was developed based on the hydrodynamics of the system with six controllable inputs to define the position and orientation assuming the vehicle is neutrally buoyant the restoring effects are neglected and the cob coincides with the cog this assumption leads to only auv mode without considering the glider and profiler mode an oscillating rigid fin model was developed and used for simulation based on the four quadrants dynamic response for the generation of gait a motion control scheme using a pd controller for tracking a reference trajectory of infinity profile was implemented by considering the thrust delay to arrive at realistic results system identification of variable buoyancy module and moving mass mechanism was attempted to achieve the actuator sizing and operation parameters later a condensed index of the optimum velocity of operation to minimize energy consumption for improved efficiency maneuverability larger payload and more extended autonomy of the vehicle was discussed operational limitations hpurv is a modular hybrid vehicle targeted to overcome the practical limitations during the deployment in real time this development aims to change the operational characteristics based on the user need hpurv can operate as a mission mode auv glider and as a profiler based on the requirement most of the significant limitations of different types of vehicles used for ocean observations have been addressed nevertheless the vehicle operation in any particular mode of operation does not provide a station keeping capability which of course is not a direct requirement concerning observation class vehicles is concerned a prototype development to test and validate these hybrid propulsion strategies based on different actuation mechanisms individually and as a combination thereof is underway this methodology as a commercial application can be seen in both underwater robotics and ocean observations and the success and availability of these hybridized systems would attract the scientific community oceanographers geologists etc for improved observation capabilities acknowledgment this work was partially supported by the department of higher education ministry of human resource
