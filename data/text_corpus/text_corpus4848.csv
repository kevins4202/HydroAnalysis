24240,synthetic gene drive gd systems constitute a form of novel invasive environmental biotechnology with far reaching consequences beyond those of other known genetically modified organisms gmos during the last 10 years the development of gd systems has been closely linked to mathematical modelling which can provide feedback on how to achieve gene drive spread but also may be used to predict the ecological consequences of a gene drive release gmos thus also gd systems need to pass an environmental risk assessment era prior to a release into the environment models in this respect may play an important role because a release of gd organisms even at a small scale may not be reversible in our review we analyse the scope and structure of existing models to examine how they may assist the era our analysis reveals that a majority of models so far are deterministic non spatial and not tailored for a specific target organism models often use simplified assumptions on the biology of the species and seem to be made to test the effectiveness of the drive few models go beyond this and verify whether model predictions may be realistic under field conditions we identified four advanced models that we judged to be the most ecologically realistic and compared the implemented parameters with era requirements by the european food safety authority efsa and world health organization who for genetically modified insects and mosquitoes although a number of abiotic and biotic factors are already considered in these models mating related factors and traits relevant to the interactions between the gmo and target organisms and with other species are largely excluded overall our results show that biological and ecological realism are still poorly realized in current models and that most models aim to predict efficacy rather than ecological effects given the complexity of natural ecosystems it may not be possible to compile a single model to cover all complexities thus models should be further developed with the purpose to assist specific questions related to the risk assessment of gds moreover uncertainty will be a key issue for any model used in ra and we see the need to improve this aspect when modelling gene drives keywords gene drive modelling risk assessment uncertainty ecological factors data availability all data is provided in the supplementary material

clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats crispr crispr associated protein cas risk assessment ra 1 background and introduction gene drives can be characterized as phenomena mostly conferred by a selfish genetic element that biases inheritance in its own favour to increase its prevalence within the population this kind of inheritance could be achieved either by so called non or super mendelian inheritance or a fitness reduction of alternative genotypes alphey et al 2020 as early as the 1960s it was proposed to harness gene drive elements for population control measures craig et al 1960 with the advances in biotechnology such as homing endonuclease genes hegs most notably the discovery of the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats crispr crispr associated protein cas system jinek et al 2012 the engineering of synthetic gene drive systems to affect wild populations has become much more feasible there are two main strategies to utilize synthetic gene drives gds for population control the first is to replace existing genotypes with a modified genotype min et al 2018 they call it alteration drive to do so a synthetic gd would propagate cargo genes and drive them to fixation in the second strategy the aim is to reduce the population size often by spreading detrimental cargo genes until the population can no longer sustain itself min et al 2018 for the application of gds in eukaryotes the only prerequisite is that the population must reproduce sexually in practice obligate sexual reproduction diploidy and a short generation time of the target organism are optional but would make a gd application faster and more effective the application of synthetic gds is being discussed in three major areas these are public health agriculture and conservation national academies of sciences 2016 the majority of envisaged applications aim at the suppression or eradication of populations in public health species acting as disease vectors are targeted for example the malaria mosquito vector of the anopheles gambiae sensu latu complex gantz et al 2015 hammond et al 2016 windbichler et al 2011 but also gds in aedes mosquitoes the vectors of dengue zika chikungunya and other diseases are a subject of research edgington and alphey 2017 up to now agricultural applications mostly focus on the suppression of pest species such as drosophila suzukii ceratitis capitate and rodents buchman et al 2018 rode et al 2019 sánchez c et al 2019 in conservation biology especially invasive species on islands are considered eradication targets most notably rats mice possums stoats and wasps dearden et al 2018 rode et al 2019 until now no synthetic gd has been released into the environment any of the above applications being put into practice would be the first deliberate release of genetically modified organisms gmos with the intention to produce offspring with their wild conspecifics however this fact poses challenges to governing bodies to devise suitable regulations especially for proper risk assessment ra efsa gmo panel 2020 for this kind of novel invasive environmental biotechnology nieb frieß et al 2020a any release would be associated with high uncertainties for biodiversity and affected ecosystems in addition any release would raise socio economic issues mitchell et al 2017 furthermore measures to control a released gd such as split drives edgington et al 2020 lópez del amo et al 2019 oberhofer et al 2021 terradas et al 2021 threshold dependant drives akbari et al 2013 j champer et al 2020c edgington and alphey 2017 min et al 2017a reeves and reed 2015 self limiting drives dhole et al 2018 min et al 2017b noble et al 2019 willis and burt 2021 inducible drives chae et al 2020 or overwriting drives girardin et al 2019 heffel and finnigan 2019 vella et al 2017 at the current stage of development have not been sufficiently tested to allow firm conclusions about their effectiveness the release of gm applications in the environment to date foresees a stepwise approach who 2014 pp 7 and expanded by national academies of sciences 2016 pp 86 where field releases are strictly confined in space and time european commission 2002 the idea behind this approach is to gradually decrease confinement measures until enough evidence has been provided to justify a full environmental release this should allow for thorough monitoring and risk mitigation in the case of unintended consequences such an approach may not be feasible for gd organisms gdos because of their markedly different properties compared to date used gm crops and animals simon et al 2018 the biased inheritance and concomitant invasive characteristics of gdos may lead to a non reversible spread of the gene drive in natural populations modelling is a tool frequently used to understand complex systems in gd research modelling is intended to predict the dynamic spread of a gene drive system in this context models are valuable in the conceptual phase i e prior to the release of the gdo into the environment however models on for instance pesticide effects have been supported by field data for calibration and validation this is not the case for gd models as field releases of gdos have not taken place to assist the era gd dynamics need to be considered over long timespans and in complex ecosystems models may thus play a prominent role in any ra prior to release efsa panel on genetically modified organisms gmo et al 2020 p 55 more than a decade has passed since the first synthetic gds were designed altrock et al 2010 chen et al 2007 dicarlo et al 2015 gantz and bier 2015 hammond et al 2016 during this time a variety of models have been applied for drive characterization models comprise all application areas and encompass different gd systems and target organisms here we analyse existing gd models and how they may contribute to an era our literature analysis includes both a quantitative and qualitative assessment considering ecological realism 2 methods to obtain an overview of existing gene drive models we performed a database search using scopus www scopus com the search string contained the terms gene drive gene drives gene drive gene drives and modelling modelling model underdominance crispr cas9 gene drive synthetic gene drives population suppression population replacement or meiotic drive or genetic and malaria control homing endonuclease gene medusa in title abstract or keywords see s1 this query retrieved 6 185 publications between 2001 and 2021 after a thorough manual check a core fraction of 113 relevant publications containing modelling approaches on gene drives could be extracted these were completed by 4 additional model publications from our personal literature collection which were not captured by the search string the complete literature list can be retrieved from supplement file s1 it has to be noted that some publications feature multiple models or models with multiple target organisms multiple gd or other super mendelian inheritance systems these publications thus may fall into multiple categories prior to statistical analysis the following information was retrieved from each of the 117 publications publication year target organism application field kind of super mendelian system s model type regarding spatiality and deterministic or probabilistic algorithm breakdown of drive mutualism parasitism density dependence rare matings predator prey relationships food sources competition assortative mating life history incest rate mating system threshold dependence fitness costs mitigation drive seasonality weather fertility fecundity geography topography human action dispersal migration all statistical analyses were carried out using microsoft excel 2019 3 results 3 1 publication year application fields and taxa studied for this literature analysis a total of 117 publications with model simulations of super mendelian inheritance have been considered sorting the analysed publications by publication date fig 1 a exemplifies that the field of super mendelian inheritance modelling research experienced a substantial increase in publication numbers after 2016 all studies have been analysed for their major application fields namely public health agriculture and biodiversity conservation most applications are concerned with public health interests while fewer deal with modelling for gene drives for nature conservation or agricultural purposes fig 1b about a third of the modelling publications could not be sorted into any of the fields indicating modelling work of generic nature to understand gene drives in general this finding is also reflected in the analysis of organisms chosen for the models models were designed to be either not targeted at a specific taxon 48 models or generic for a broader group 27 models only 42 different models were directed to specific species the majority of species specific models were directed to gene drives targeting mosquitoes 31 models the remaining species specific 12 models addressed pest insects and rodents being a threat to island biodiversity or agricultural yield figs 1c and d the generic or specific target organisms and the respective publications are listed in table 1 3 2 drive system and study focus the models investigated consider a wide range of different systems of super mendelian inheritance more than half of the publications feature models that include gds mechanistically based on heg most notably crispr based homing drives fig 2 a meiotic drives are modelled not even half as often in descending order these two major super mendelian inheritance systems are followed by toxin antidote systems such as some underdominance systems medea and medea related crispr ta and killer rescue evaluating the study focus of the reviewed publications on the overall gene drive strategy fig 2b more than one third of the models concern population replacement while suppression is the second most often modelled application strategy some focus on both replacement and suppression strikingly many studies consider both strategies in the text but only model replacement these two population control strategies cover roughly three quarters of the modelling approaches although single studies may fall into more than one category twelve studies also focus on reversal drives 3 26 49 65 77 78 86 93 94 98 100 107 in contrast to replacement invasion represents the establishment of a genetic construct within a population regardless of whether the majority of the population is reached invasion as a focus is represented in four studies 4 17 54 65 four of the published models investigate wild type population dynamics 13 16 18 115 the last catch all group of other comprised more extraordinary foci as the spread of various drives marshall 2009 15 the benefits of meiotic vs embryonic conversion and escapees de jong 2017 39 grna multiplexing champer et al 2018 53 allele effects on gene drive effects walker et al 2019 64 non genetic transgenerational costs wong and holman 2019 67 and post drive spread of parasite patches bull et al 2019a 74 3 3 modelling characteristics with regard to their computational approach usually models may be either deterministic or stochastic table 2 however within some of the considered studies models were introduced based on both approaches deterministic models utilize fixed numbers as input in their computations and thus also yield fixed numbers as outputs however stochastic models consider a random component and thus yield ranges of possible results with different probabilities for the latter kind of model sensitivity analyses are very important to assess the impact of variations in the applied variables furthermore models may be either spatial or non spatial for this analysis we counted models as spatial when at least two non randomly mating demes were implemented table 2 shows the distribution of the models along these criteria the majority of considered studies featured deterministic non spatial models1 2 4 6 7 8 9 10 11 14 20 23 28 34 36 38 39 40 41 42 43 45 49 52 55 57 61 62 64 67 68 69 71 77 78 82 83 85 86 88 68 71 77 78 82 83 85 86 88 96 97 101 104 106 107 111 followed by deterministic spatial models3 12 22 31 37 44 51 54 58 65 70 72 74 75 76 79 80 92 108 110 113 since gene drives or other modes of super mendelian inheritance in eukaryotic organisms are dependant on sexual reproduction any model should implement a way of reproduction in this regard mate choice is most important true mate choices can only be implemented under stochastic conditions and are dependant on the chosen target organism the models implemented reproductive strategies that are either semelparous single mating like that of mosquitoes or iteroparous multiple matings like that of some flies or mammals that are either polyandrous or polygynous however as shown before the majority of models are deterministic and therefore feature a form of perfect panmixis random mating fig 3 a this means the offspring of a whole generation is produced according to the genotype percentages in the population panmixis does not realistically reflect the conditions in wild populations and represents a severe simplification in modelling stochastic effects increase when sample size in this case population size decreases melbourne 2019 despite this some studies that do model population suppression also implemented perfect panmixis edgington and alphey 2018 fig 4 and 5 karaminejadranjibar et al 2018 fig 4 kyrou et al 2018 fig 5b 58 59 61 or are simply deterministic backus and gross 2016 36 all models considered at least certain aspects of spatiality e g limit panmixis to organisms within the same deme patch household or within the dispersal radius fig 3a shows how often which kind of reproductive strategy is implemented about two thirds of all models rely on the above mentioned perfect or percentile panmixis albeit perfect panmixis and itero or semelparity are not mutually exclusive features if a model exhibits perfect panmixis it is thus only counted towards that category even including eleven stochasticity capable models 5 15 21 26 30 53 56 90 93 98 100 the four models denoted with limited panmixis are deterministic spatial models where the population is subdivided into patches of panmixis 22 72 74 76 twelve models implemented iteroparity 14 27 36 47 62 63 81 83 87 101 115 117 twenty six studies implemented semelparity in their models 5 13 16 18 23 25 29 32 33 48 60 66 73 84 89 91 94 97 99 102 103 105 109 112 114 116 the slim model system is the only model which allows to vary the reproductive strategy haller and messer 2019 66 fig 3b depicts further features and how often they are implemented into the considered models the most frequently implemented feature is fitness cost for super mendelian inheritance modelling fitness costs are applied synonymously with a genetic load often relative fitness cost is implemented as a multiplier between 0 and 1 to the amount of offspring generated in a few models this is even done sex specifically the second most often implemented feature is gene drive thresholds followed by the breakdown of the drive such as the implementation of pre existing acquired or synthetic resistance the implementation of life history is the decisive factor in whether or not a model is dedicated to a specific target organism or a generic system life history may potentially encompass many parameters the most often used parameters are merely life stages mortality rate reproductive strategy number of offspring and dispersal in some models many stochastic studies do not implement a definitive longevity for the final life stages but instead a mortality rate which potentially allows for infinitely old individuals even less frequently implemented parameters are fertility and fecundity population and assortative mating and mate choice preferences each parameter for life history traits may decisively influence the outcome of a model simulation therefore the utilized values and functioning of the parameters should be met with diligent scrutiny most studies therefore rely on values derived from studies under controlled conditions which might however not be in accordance with field generated data additionally field data may often vary significantly between studies exemplifying heterogeneity in different habitats and population dynamics fertility and fecundity respectively are implemented in 38 models fertility is the ability to produce viable offspring and fecundity is the quantity of offspring in most cases those parameters are implemented in the amalgamated form of a multiplier to the amount of offspring with a value of 1 or below just like fitness in others fecundity is implemented as a variable number of offspring generated from a mating in some studies a reduction in fecundity is the chosen way to implement fitness costs mgdrive 73 89 91 94 109 112 115 in yet others fertility fecundity is influenced by the drive s cargo gene s e champer et al 2020 eckhoff et al 2017 kyrou et al 2018 north et al 2020 simoni et al 2020 46 59 95 97 102 117 roughly 43 of the considered studies implemented density dependence into their models the other models either assume a population of fixed or relative size density dependence revolves around the implementation of a carrying capacity however the consequences when closing in on that carrying capacity vary some models reduce population growth down to zero prowse et al 2018 43 others reduce fecundity bull et al 2019a j champer et al 2020a eckhoff et al 2017 haller and messer 2019 47 66 74 105 or increase larval mortality 10 13 22 25 32 37 48 73 84 89 91 94 some studies reduce births and increase death backus and gross 2016 36 and yet other models reduce fitness j champer et al 2020c edgington and alphey 2018 85 105 thirty one models implemented competition which in most cases only affect the larval stage this larval competition is reminiscent of density dependence limited to a premature life stage only the model by manser et al 2019 83 implemented sperm competition fifteen models incorporated geography topography 12 13 16 18 25 27 29 46 60 66 79 84 99 102 110 relying on either real life geography or urban households to plot the target organisms habitats or at least continuous space for agents to move in relatedly in 13 publications seasonality or weather data 13 15 16 18 25 29 46 50 60 84 99 102 115 are implemented five of which represent the skeeter buster model legros et al 2013 2011 magori et al 2009 okamoto et al 2013 xu et al 2010 13 16 18 25 29 both features may be decisive factors to predict gene drive spread in real life applications twelve publications include various mitigation techniques 49 65 77 78 86 93 94 98 100 107 116 117 inbreeding was shown to be another important factor implemented in the models of six studies 38 40 41 63 66 76 in three studies inbreeding is shown to be a decisive factor bull 2016 bull et al 2019b drury et al 2017 38 41 76 other factors like assortative mating human action food sources predator prey relationships rare matings and mutualism parasitism are each implemented in 6 models or less albeit these features may provide a certain ecological realism necessary for era 3 4 suitability of models to assist the risk assessment of gene drives 3 4 1 most powerful models from this analysis the likely most powerful models in terms of versatility were selected to closer examine them according to their suitability to assist an era of gene drives the quantitative selection process was done by comparing the number of implemented features in models with spatial and stochastic capabilities see table s2 the selected models are the ones from north et al slim3 skeeter buster and mgdrive the model by north et al is a spatial stochastic or deterministic agent based simulation which covers a large geographic area of one million square miles it is directed at the life history of malaria vectors anopheles gambiae and a coluzzii the life history is implemented as two stages juvenile and adult adults are represented as males and multiple female stages of mate host or breeding site seeking so far publications focused on a meiotic sex distorter y drive north et al 2019 84 and a crispr cas based homing drive with a female infertility cargo gene north et al 2020 102 in simulated eight year time frames the model considers abiotic factors such as regional seasonality and perennial and non perennial water bodies as breeding sites for the target organism north and godfray 2018 each breeding site in the vicinity of human settlements is an agent biotic factors such as larval competition which acts as the density dependant carrying capacity migration aestivation and long distance migration are also considered by this model although especially these latter two parameters due to uncertainty rely more on assumptions rather than on field data the slim3 model haller and messer 2019 66 can be used in a deterministic or stochastic fashion and in a spatial and non spatial manner it is based on a wright fisher model but exceeds its predecessor by implementing age structured populations mate choice inherent offspring generation overlapping generations migration hard selection continuous space maps for different parameters and populations interactions with interaction strengths and radii genetics different types of mutations and individual organisms the so far published simulations examined heg drive champer et al 2018 champer et al 2020 53 97 crispr ta j champer et al 2020a 103 as well as four different underdominance variants j champer et al 2020b 105 all these published models have been generic although the model would allow customization towards the life history of a specific target organism the simulated time frames varied between 40 and 100 generations although slim3 would be a very versatile model this versatility comes at the price of a lack of modularity the continuous space can be defined with areas of parameter changes such as fitness population density and so on but it would prove difficult for an assessor to define real landscapes according to abstract terms of population dynamics likewise the software can be designed to accommodate specific target organisms which would be a challenging endeavour to do the skeeter buster magori et al 2009 13 software is a stochastic spatial model directed at aedes aegypti the model simulates individual water containers in 612 in fourfold copy of 153 households in iquitos peru legros et al 2011 18 each container is modelled with a water level nutrition and temperature those factors determine the larval weight and thereby development and competition weight also determines the fecundity and mating capability of adult mosquitoes the model distinguishes eggs larvae pupae and adult mosquitoes this software is the most detailed considering the life history of its target organism it features two modes of dispersal migration to neighbouring households or long distance 200 m by either adults or the displacement of entire containers furthermore different release strategies and weather conditions such as temperature precipitation and humidity from iquitos peru and buenos aires argentina have been considered legros et al 2011 18 medea and killer rescue legros et al 2013 25 as well as ridl and an anti pathogen gene were simulated with this model okamoto et al 2014 33 the modelling time frames were set between two to five years mgdrive sánchez c et al 2019 73 is a deterministic or stochastic spatial modelling software that has a modular build each model run consists of an inheritance cube module a life history module and a landscape module the inheritance cube module is designed according to the respective genetic system so far inheritance cubes exist for crispr based homing drives for replacement or suppression medea ridl wolbachia underdominance translocations sánchez c et al 2020 94 transcomplementing homing drive lópez del amo et al 2020 91 and a split heg drive li et al 2020 89 inheritance may also be linked to a set of sex specific variable parameters and emerging resistance alleles that can vary in fitness penalty and probability of occurrence the life history module works with lumped age class structures that may vary in a set of parameters and are predefined for a gambiae ae aegypti and c capitate the landscape module consists of a network of interconnected habitats migration probability between different habitats may be variably set finally release schemes specifying habitat size number frequency and beginning can be customized while the inheritance cube modules are quite detailed and comprehensive life history and landscapes seem to be covered rather superficially and more abstractly while other ecological factors are completely disregarded but the follow up version mgdrive 2 wu et al 2021 116 alleviated some of these issues as now life history and migration parameters can be changed over time furthermore additional inheritance cubes are included such as remediation systems chacr eracr and cleaver oberhofer et al 2019 most notably an epidemiology module was included that harbours a lumped class human population that can progress through the states of susceptible latently infected or infectious and in the case of arboviruses dengue also recovered likewise except for recovered the mosquitoes now possess the same denominators nevertheless the genetic component of the model remains the most elaborated module as opposed to the rather crude and abstract other modules 3 4 2 information requirements for gm insect releases by efsa and who there is still little guidance which specifically addresses the ra of gene drives however the efsa and the who both published guidance documents efsa 2013 who 2014 regarding the assessment of transgenic animals and transgenic mosquitoes these can be applied to the most advanced applications of gene drive in mosquitoes with the following analysis we do not want to imply that there is a need for a single model to address all aspects instead cross comparison of the results of multiple models may even be more reliable we also do not hold the position that the listed aspects of table 3 represent a valid exhaustive checklist even if models would cover all aspects we cannot make qualitative statements on their validity nor do we want to criticize the assessed models rather we use the guidance documents as indicators to illustrate the current status of modelling concerning era requirements according to efsa mathematical models used in era should provide information about its parameters verification validation sensitivity analysis and evaluation of unquantified uncertainties efsa panel on genetically modified organisms gmo 2013 pp 41 so far none of the models analysed presently can match these criteria however models do address some of the areas of risk for which information has to be provided to support the ra of transgenic insects efsa panel on genetically modified organisms gmo 2013 table 3 there are seven major areas of interest when assessing the release of a gm insect into the environment persistence and invasiveness vertical and horizontal gene transfer pathogens infections and diseases interactions between the gmo with target and non target organisms impacts on human and animal health and impacts on techniques for the management of gm insects efsa gmo panel 2013 chapter 4 2 corresponding to these major areas of risk there are specific characteristics that could potentially be predicted through modelling these are considered in table 3 where implemented features are denoted with a green check mark and un implemented features with a red cross mark as shown in table 3 current gene drive models at least partially consider abiotic factors as well as biotic factors related to the target organism such as reproductive biology fitness etc some gmo related biotic traits are also considered but with the exception of interactions with pathogens there are no models that consider interactions between the gm insect and non target organisms or food webs while 18 out of the 37 listed characteristics are addressed at least by single models 19 of the information elements were not included in models it may also be mentioned that some of the listed characteristics may simply not apply to gd in general or for specific applications the who guidance is more narrow in scope and is not focussed on gm insects but specifically on gm mosquitoes who tdr and fnih 2014 and are applicable for gene drives in fact it has been referred to by the national academies of sciences engineering and medicine in their work on gene drives national academies of sciences 2016 in this guidance document or its second edition two tables are provided on example parameters that may be relevant in laboratory studies and open field studies as part of the ra for transgenic mosquitoes who tdr and fnih et al 2021 tables 3 2 3 3 2014 tables 3 1 3 2 in table 4 we compiled parameters and checked similar to the efsa guideline whether the information elements have been covered by the models we analysed here orange check marks exemplify special cases explained below table 4 it is apparent that the who list comprises fewer characteristics than that of efsa one reason is the narrower scope of the who document and that efsa also considers impacts such as horizontal gene transfer hybridization and broader ecological interactions of species only four characteristics by the who are presently not covered by the sum of modelling approaches these are insecticide behavioural and biochemical resistance as well as mass rearing quality indices biochemical resistance means physiological changes to avoid or reduce the efficacy of conventional management mass rearing quality indices mean the low quality of gm insects due to inbreeding though it may be argued that the mass rearing quality indices are accounted for by the majority of models by implementing fitness costs the issue is likely more complex and would better be captured by the inclusion of inbreeding depression and hybrid vigour which are complex issues themselves 4 discussion our analysis of 117 publications shows that modelling gene drive properties is an important aspect of gd research since the earliest conception craig et al 1960 and first engineered synthetic gene drives chen et al 2007 with the advent of crispr cas jumpstarting heg based drives dicarlo et al 2015 gantz et al 2015 gantz and bier 2015 hammond et al 2016 there was a delayed spike in publications on model simulations of super mendelian inheritance beginning in 2017 in the analysed models application wise there is a focus on public health 55 models and mechanistically on heg based homing drives 54 models the most frequent study focus in the models is put on replacement 72 studies although many models are dedicated to a specific application the majority of the evaluated models are directed at generic target organisms 75 models mosquitoes as the exception however account for 25 of overall models and 72 of species specific models this is probably because gene drives in mosquitoes are thought to contribute to a reduction in vector borne disease which established mosquitoes as the model genus for gene drive research regarding their ability to reflect natural conditions most models are cautious about incorporating too much complexity they are kept comparably simple as deterministic and non spatial approaches 47 models and employ a mating system of perfect panmixis 73 models this coincides with the finding that most models are concerned with the efficacy of the respective drive system and are more focused on a proof of concept than on the ecological implications of the application context in all models analysed including the four models selected for closer comparative analysis traits relevant to interactions with other species are mostly absent an exception is the mgdrive model which can account for altered transmission range and frequency due to pathogens of the target organism or increased vector competence but also considers interactions with symbionts hosts and parasites 4 1 most versatile to date models cannot support the information needed for gene drive risk assessment we compared the versatility of models to better judge whether they can simulate complex environmental relationships and thus assist era the most versatile models were analysed in more detail for their ability to fulfil the complex requirements of era laid out by guidance documents of efsa and who efsa panel on genetically modified organisms gmo 2013 who tdr and fnih 2021 2014 on the one hand selected models already incorporate a number of abiotic and biotic factors but the characteristics covered by the selected models are strongly focused on predicting the spread of the gene drive and the impact on the population size of the target organism on the other hand comparing the models to guidance frameworks efsa and who illustrate that models currently fall short to include a wide range of processes needed for the ra in particular criteria such as the potential to explore new niches behavioural changes heterosis hybridization horizontal gene transfer trophic relationships interspecies competition and ecosystem services have not yet been considered in gene drive models these characteristics are repetitively subject to relevant pathways to harm in the problem formulation for gd mosquitoes connolly et al 2021 and will be important for modelling the ecological effects of synthetic gene drives in general with a focus on the spread of the gd and the target population general aspects of the target population and the gmo were included in the models however the selected models so far exclude very fundamental effects such as effects of the genetic modification on the interaction between gmos and the target organisms or effects on the fitness of hybrids similar deficits of important aspects of the target organism s biology are related to dispersal or the mating system verma et al 2023 which may be crucial to predicting the envisaged spread but will also be crucial for the fate of the gene drive in the environment 4 2 the necessary level of certainty of model predictions depends on the context of use while modelling approaches for efficacy testing and era pursue some overlapping goals they differ in the level of certainty they need to provide from the developer s perspective if it turns out that the actual efficacy of the drive is higher than expected in the models this will likely be an argument in favour of this new technology compared to predecessors such as sterile insect technology sit but from the perspective of ra any deviation from the predicted spread of the gene drive is critical the reason is that predictions on the temporal and spatial spread define exposure to the environment and thus must be considered key data to predict indirect effects on biodiversity even a failed gene drive with a low propensity to spread may remain in the environment also if synthetic gene drive systems are more effective than expected this might trigger enhanced spatial or temporal exposure with consequences which need to be assessed before a gene drive is released into the environment in this review we focus on the mere implementation of different features we however did not investigate the uncertainties related to these features which would be essential to characterize the risk assessment many aspects remain understudied since their decisive ecological contexts may be highly case specific and dependant on the respective ecosystem or habitat hence many field situations can be considered to be multifactorial with likely unknown or highly variable influence to account for this it is desirable for modellers to include more stochasticity which would allow them to increase the capacity to both simulate rare events and better estimate uncertainties however uncertainty will remain an important issue when using models to assist the risk assessment of gds and it is unclear which effects can be modelled with the necessary precision especially for long term effects in highly complex ecosystems one way to account for uncertainty may be the application of uncertainty or safety factors in analogy to the assessment of toxicological or eco toxicological effects from pharmaceuticals or pesticides however as the u s national research council has noted the unrecognized sources of uncertainty surprise and fundamental ignorance about the basic processes that drive risk are often important sources of uncertainty and formal analysis may not help if they are too large national research council 1996 p 5 4 3 dilemma to obtain data for model parametrisation and validation if models especially for the purpose to predict the spread and ecological effects in the environment are to be parametrized or validated field data are necessary while some data e g on the ecology and life history of target and non target species may cost considerable effort they can be obtained without a gene drive release data for model validation in contrast depend on field data gene drive organisms will always be genetically modified and as such regulated as gmos as the risk assessment and therefore model validation has to be carried out prior to full scale release gene drive organisms challenge the to date risk assessment concepts which foresee a stepwise release of gmos into the environment all field experiments for this purpose must be strictly limited in both time and space gene drives however may not easily be contained in field experiments where the escape of few individuals with an effective drive may have the consequences of an unlimited time lagged non reversible release into the environment esvelt and gemmell 2017 simon et al 2018 although it may be possible to extrapolate data from previous field releases of other bio control measures inevitably more field studies would necessarily need to be conducted to obtain reliable data for modelling 5 conclusions an era is considerably more complicated for gds compared to other categories of gmos simon et al 2018 models are considered important risk assessment tools for gene drives the objective of this article is to analyse how far current models can inform era where models are required to possess in depth ecological realism and reliably assess critical questions related to environmental risks taken together our results show that biological and ecological realism are still poorly realized in current models by reviewing the models we identified a set of less frequently implemented parameters assortative matings incest rate human action food sources predator prey relationships rare matings and mutualism parasitism that can help enhance ecological realism in this regard cross comparisons of various models may help quantify uncertainties moreover to assess the effects of releasing synthetic gene drives like all gmos there is a need to study all levels of organization from genetics to species population and landscape including their interactions gene drive models are in a dilemma as field releases to obtain data are difficult to perform due to their intended ability to spread in the environment thus to model environmental effects more complexity must be accounted for by modelling approaches verma et al 2021 other novel forms of invasive environmental biotechnology such as transmissible vaccines or horizontal environmental genetic alteration agents reeves et al 2018 will likely suffer from the same dilemma while modelling efficacy is a blooming and developing field modelling ecological effects is like in many other fields still in its infancy this is owed to the complexity of the task see above to solve this issue we propose to develop specific models aimed at evaluating ecological effects instead of efficacy in order to assist era modelling per se is a highly valuable tool which is already used in the era for gmos pesticides or toxicants baudrot et al 2021 efsa panel on plant protection products and their residues ppr et al 2018 fahse et al 2018 perry et al 2012 ziółkowska et al 2021 however in the case of gene drives risk assessors and risk managers have not agreed on concepts methods endpoints or data requirements to use such models we assume it will take considerable effort and time to achieve this national and international harmonization harmonisation will also be necessary for monitoring activities of gene drive applications which will be demanding long term and costly even though ecological realism in modelling is important for era it is important to remember that extrapolations from models can only serve as rough guides and will also in the future likely be far from being able to simulate the complexity of the environment

24240,synthetic gene drive gd systems constitute a form of novel invasive environmental biotechnology with far reaching consequences beyond those of other known genetically modified organisms gmos during the last 10 years the development of gd systems has been closely linked to mathematical modelling which can provide feedback on how to achieve gene drive spread but also may be used to predict the ecological consequences of a gene drive release gmos thus also gd systems need to pass an environmental risk assessment era prior to a release into the environment models in this respect may play an important role because a release of gd organisms even at a small scale may not be reversible in our review we analyse the scope and structure of existing models to examine how they may assist the era our analysis reveals that a majority of models so far are deterministic non spatial and not tailored for a specific target organism models often use simplified assumptions on the biology of the species and seem to be made to test the effectiveness of the drive few models go beyond this and verify whether model predictions may be realistic under field conditions we identified four advanced models that we judged to be the most ecologically realistic and compared the implemented parameters with era requirements by the european food safety authority efsa and world health organization who for genetically modified insects and mosquitoes although a number of abiotic and biotic factors are already considered in these models mating related factors and traits relevant to the interactions between the gmo and target organisms and with other species are largely excluded overall our results show that biological and ecological realism are still poorly realized in current models and that most models aim to predict efficacy rather than ecological effects given the complexity of natural ecosystems it may not be possible to compile a single model to cover all complexities thus models should be further developed with the purpose to assist specific questions related to the risk assessment of gds moreover uncertainty will be a key issue for any model used in ra and we see the need to improve this aspect when modelling gene drives keywords gene drive modelling risk assessment uncertainty ecological factors data availability all data is provided in the supplementary material

clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats crispr crispr associated protein cas risk assessment ra 1 background and introduction gene drives can be characterized as phenomena mostly conferred by a selfish genetic element that biases inheritance in its own favour to increase its prevalence within the population this kind of inheritance could be achieved either by so called non or super mendelian inheritance or a fitness reduction of alternative genotypes alphey et al 2020 as early as the 1960s it was proposed to harness gene drive elements for population control measures craig et al 1960 with the advances in biotechnology such as homing endonuclease genes hegs most notably the discovery of the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats crispr crispr associated protein cas system jinek et al 2012 the engineering of synthetic gene drive systems to affect wild populations has become much more feasible there are two main strategies to utilize synthetic gene drives gds for population control the first is to replace existing genotypes with a modified genotype min et al 2018 they call it alteration drive to do so a synthetic gd would propagate cargo genes and drive them to fixation in the second strategy the aim is to reduce the population size often by spreading detrimental cargo genes until the population can no longer sustain itself min et al 2018 for the application of gds in eukaryotes the only prerequisite is that the population must reproduce sexually in practice obligate sexual reproduction diploidy and a short generation time of the target organism are optional but would make a gd application faster and more effective the application of synthetic gds is being discussed in three major areas these are public health agriculture and conservation national academies of sciences 2016 the majority of envisaged applications aim at the suppression or eradication of populations in public health species acting as disease vectors are targeted for example the malaria mosquito vector of the anopheles gambiae sensu latu complex gantz et al 2015 hammond et al 2016 windbichler et al 2011 but also gds in aedes mosquitoes the vectors of dengue zika chikungunya and other diseases are a subject of research edgington and alphey 2017 up to now agricultural applications mostly focus on the suppression of pest species such as drosophila suzukii ceratitis capitate and rodents buchman et al 2018 rode et al 2019 sánchez c et al 2019 in conservation biology especially invasive species on islands are considered eradication targets most notably rats mice possums stoats and wasps dearden et al 2018 rode et al 2019 until now no synthetic gd has been released into the environment any of the above applications being put into practice would be the first deliberate release of genetically modified organisms gmos with the intention to produce offspring with their wild conspecifics however this fact poses challenges to governing bodies to devise suitable regulations especially for proper risk assessment ra efsa gmo panel 2020 for this kind of novel invasive environmental biotechnology nieb frieß et al 2020a any release would be associated with high uncertainties for biodiversity and affected ecosystems in addition any release would raise socio economic issues mitchell et al 2017 furthermore measures to control a released gd such as split drives edgington et al 2020 lópez del amo et al 2019 oberhofer et al 2021 terradas et al 2021 threshold dependant drives akbari et al 2013 j champer et al 2020c edgington and alphey 2017 min et al 2017a reeves and reed 2015 self limiting drives dhole et al 2018 min et al 2017b noble et al 2019 willis and burt 2021 inducible drives chae et al 2020 or overwriting drives girardin et al 2019 heffel and finnigan 2019 vella et al 2017 at the current stage of development have not been sufficiently tested to allow firm conclusions about their effectiveness the release of gm applications in the environment to date foresees a stepwise approach who 2014 pp 7 and expanded by national academies of sciences 2016 pp 86 where field releases are strictly confined in space and time european commission 2002 the idea behind this approach is to gradually decrease confinement measures until enough evidence has been provided to justify a full environmental release this should allow for thorough monitoring and risk mitigation in the case of unintended consequences such an approach may not be feasible for gd organisms gdos because of their markedly different properties compared to date used gm crops and animals simon et al 2018 the biased inheritance and concomitant invasive characteristics of gdos may lead to a non reversible spread of the gene drive in natural populations modelling is a tool frequently used to understand complex systems in gd research modelling is intended to predict the dynamic spread of a gene drive system in this context models are valuable in the conceptual phase i e prior to the release of the gdo into the environment however models on for instance pesticide effects have been supported by field data for calibration and validation this is not the case for gd models as field releases of gdos have not taken place to assist the era gd dynamics need to be considered over long timespans and in complex ecosystems models may thus play a prominent role in any ra prior to release efsa panel on genetically modified organisms gmo et al 2020 p 55 more than a decade has passed since the first synthetic gds were designed altrock et al 2010 chen et al 2007 dicarlo et al 2015 gantz and bier 2015 hammond et al 2016 during this time a variety of models have been applied for drive characterization models comprise all application areas and encompass different gd systems and target organisms here we analyse existing gd models and how they may contribute to an era our literature analysis includes both a quantitative and qualitative assessment considering ecological realism 2 methods to obtain an overview of existing gene drive models we performed a database search using scopus www scopus com the search string contained the terms gene drive gene drives gene drive gene drives and modelling modelling model underdominance crispr cas9 gene drive synthetic gene drives population suppression population replacement or meiotic drive or genetic and malaria control homing endonuclease gene medusa in title abstract or keywords see s1 this query retrieved 6 185 publications between 2001 and 2021 after a thorough manual check a core fraction of 113 relevant publications containing modelling approaches on gene drives could be extracted these were completed by 4 additional model publications from our personal literature collection which were not captured by the search string the complete literature list can be retrieved from supplement file s1 it has to be noted that some publications feature multiple models or models with multiple target organisms multiple gd or other super mendelian inheritance systems these publications thus may fall into multiple categories prior to statistical analysis the following information was retrieved from each of the 117 publications publication year target organism application field kind of super mendelian system s model type regarding spatiality and deterministic or probabilistic algorithm breakdown of drive mutualism parasitism density dependence rare matings predator prey relationships food sources competition assortative mating life history incest rate mating system threshold dependence fitness costs mitigation drive seasonality weather fertility fecundity geography topography human action dispersal migration all statistical analyses were carried out using microsoft excel 2019 3 results 3 1 publication year application fields and taxa studied for this literature analysis a total of 117 publications with model simulations of super mendelian inheritance have been considered sorting the analysed publications by publication date fig 1 a exemplifies that the field of super mendelian inheritance modelling research experienced a substantial increase in publication numbers after 2016 all studies have been analysed for their major application fields namely public health agriculture and biodiversity conservation most applications are concerned with public health interests while fewer deal with modelling for gene drives for nature conservation or agricultural purposes fig 1b about a third of the modelling publications could not be sorted into any of the fields indicating modelling work of generic nature to understand gene drives in general this finding is also reflected in the analysis of organisms chosen for the models models were designed to be either not targeted at a specific taxon 48 models or generic for a broader group 27 models only 42 different models were directed to specific species the majority of species specific models were directed to gene drives targeting mosquitoes 31 models the remaining species specific 12 models addressed pest insects and rodents being a threat to island biodiversity or agricultural yield figs 1c and d the generic or specific target organisms and the respective publications are listed in table 1 3 2 drive system and study focus the models investigated consider a wide range of different systems of super mendelian inheritance more than half of the publications feature models that include gds mechanistically based on heg most notably crispr based homing drives fig 2 a meiotic drives are modelled not even half as often in descending order these two major super mendelian inheritance systems are followed by toxin antidote systems such as some underdominance systems medea and medea related crispr ta and killer rescue evaluating the study focus of the reviewed publications on the overall gene drive strategy fig 2b more than one third of the models concern population replacement while suppression is the second most often modelled application strategy some focus on both replacement and suppression strikingly many studies consider both strategies in the text but only model replacement these two population control strategies cover roughly three quarters of the modelling approaches although single studies may fall into more than one category twelve studies also focus on reversal drives 3 26 49 65 77 78 86 93 94 98 100 107 in contrast to replacement invasion represents the establishment of a genetic construct within a population regardless of whether the majority of the population is reached invasion as a focus is represented in four studies 4 17 54 65 four of the published models investigate wild type population dynamics 13 16 18 115 the last catch all group of other comprised more extraordinary foci as the spread of various drives marshall 2009 15 the benefits of meiotic vs embryonic conversion and escapees de jong 2017 39 grna multiplexing champer et al 2018 53 allele effects on gene drive effects walker et al 2019 64 non genetic transgenerational costs wong and holman 2019 67 and post drive spread of parasite patches bull et al 2019a 74 3 3 modelling characteristics with regard to their computational approach usually models may be either deterministic or stochastic table 2 however within some of the considered studies models were introduced based on both approaches deterministic models utilize fixed numbers as input in their computations and thus also yield fixed numbers as outputs however stochastic models consider a random component and thus yield ranges of possible results with different probabilities for the latter kind of model sensitivity analyses are very important to assess the impact of variations in the applied variables furthermore models may be either spatial or non spatial for this analysis we counted models as spatial when at least two non randomly mating demes were implemented table 2 shows the distribution of the models along these criteria the majority of considered studies featured deterministic non spatial models1 2 4 6 7 8 9 10 11 14 20 23 28 34 36 38 39 40 41 42 43 45 49 52 55 57 61 62 64 67 68 69 71 77 78 82 83 85 86 88 68 71 77 78 82 83 85 86 88 96 97 101 104 106 107 111 followed by deterministic spatial models3 12 22 31 37 44 51 54 58 65 70 72 74 75 76 79 80 92 108 110 113 since gene drives or other modes of super mendelian inheritance in eukaryotic organisms are dependant on sexual reproduction any model should implement a way of reproduction in this regard mate choice is most important true mate choices can only be implemented under stochastic conditions and are dependant on the chosen target organism the models implemented reproductive strategies that are either semelparous single mating like that of mosquitoes or iteroparous multiple matings like that of some flies or mammals that are either polyandrous or polygynous however as shown before the majority of models are deterministic and therefore feature a form of perfect panmixis random mating fig 3 a this means the offspring of a whole generation is produced according to the genotype percentages in the population panmixis does not realistically reflect the conditions in wild populations and represents a severe simplification in modelling stochastic effects increase when sample size in this case population size decreases melbourne 2019 despite this some studies that do model population suppression also implemented perfect panmixis edgington and alphey 2018 fig 4 and 5 karaminejadranjibar et al 2018 fig 4 kyrou et al 2018 fig 5b 58 59 61 or are simply deterministic backus and gross 2016 36 all models considered at least certain aspects of spatiality e g limit panmixis to organisms within the same deme patch household or within the dispersal radius fig 3a shows how often which kind of reproductive strategy is implemented about two thirds of all models rely on the above mentioned perfect or percentile panmixis albeit perfect panmixis and itero or semelparity are not mutually exclusive features if a model exhibits perfect panmixis it is thus only counted towards that category even including eleven stochasticity capable models 5 15 21 26 30 53 56 90 93 98 100 the four models denoted with limited panmixis are deterministic spatial models where the population is subdivided into patches of panmixis 22 72 74 76 twelve models implemented iteroparity 14 27 36 47 62 63 81 83 87 101 115 117 twenty six studies implemented semelparity in their models 5 13 16 18 23 25 29 32 33 48 60 66 73 84 89 91 94 97 99 102 103 105 109 112 114 116 the slim model system is the only model which allows to vary the reproductive strategy haller and messer 2019 66 fig 3b depicts further features and how often they are implemented into the considered models the most frequently implemented feature is fitness cost for super mendelian inheritance modelling fitness costs are applied synonymously with a genetic load often relative fitness cost is implemented as a multiplier between 0 and 1 to the amount of offspring generated in a few models this is even done sex specifically the second most often implemented feature is gene drive thresholds followed by the breakdown of the drive such as the implementation of pre existing acquired or synthetic resistance the implementation of life history is the decisive factor in whether or not a model is dedicated to a specific target organism or a generic system life history may potentially encompass many parameters the most often used parameters are merely life stages mortality rate reproductive strategy number of offspring and dispersal in some models many stochastic studies do not implement a definitive longevity for the final life stages but instead a mortality rate which potentially allows for infinitely old individuals even less frequently implemented parameters are fertility and fecundity population and assortative mating and mate choice preferences each parameter for life history traits may decisively influence the outcome of a model simulation therefore the utilized values and functioning of the parameters should be met with diligent scrutiny most studies therefore rely on values derived from studies under controlled conditions which might however not be in accordance with field generated data additionally field data may often vary significantly between studies exemplifying heterogeneity in different habitats and population dynamics fertility and fecundity respectively are implemented in 38 models fertility is the ability to produce viable offspring and fecundity is the quantity of offspring in most cases those parameters are implemented in the amalgamated form of a multiplier to the amount of offspring with a value of 1 or below just like fitness in others fecundity is implemented as a variable number of offspring generated from a mating in some studies a reduction in fecundity is the chosen way to implement fitness costs mgdrive 73 89 91 94 109 112 115 in yet others fertility fecundity is influenced by the drive s cargo gene s e champer et al 2020 eckhoff et al 2017 kyrou et al 2018 north et al 2020 simoni et al 2020 46 59 95 97 102 117 roughly 43 of the considered studies implemented density dependence into their models the other models either assume a population of fixed or relative size density dependence revolves around the implementation of a carrying capacity however the consequences when closing in on that carrying capacity vary some models reduce population growth down to zero prowse et al 2018 43 others reduce fecundity bull et al 2019a j champer et al 2020a eckhoff et al 2017 haller and messer 2019 47 66 74 105 or increase larval mortality 10 13 22 25 32 37 48 73 84 89 91 94 some studies reduce births and increase death backus and gross 2016 36 and yet other models reduce fitness j champer et al 2020c edgington and alphey 2018 85 105 thirty one models implemented competition which in most cases only affect the larval stage this larval competition is reminiscent of density dependence limited to a premature life stage only the model by manser et al 2019 83 implemented sperm competition fifteen models incorporated geography topography 12 13 16 18 25 27 29 46 60 66 79 84 99 102 110 relying on either real life geography or urban households to plot the target organisms habitats or at least continuous space for agents to move in relatedly in 13 publications seasonality or weather data 13 15 16 18 25 29 46 50 60 84 99 102 115 are implemented five of which represent the skeeter buster model legros et al 2013 2011 magori et al 2009 okamoto et al 2013 xu et al 2010 13 16 18 25 29 both features may be decisive factors to predict gene drive spread in real life applications twelve publications include various mitigation techniques 49 65 77 78 86 93 94 98 100 107 116 117 inbreeding was shown to be another important factor implemented in the models of six studies 38 40 41 63 66 76 in three studies inbreeding is shown to be a decisive factor bull 2016 bull et al 2019b drury et al 2017 38 41 76 other factors like assortative mating human action food sources predator prey relationships rare matings and mutualism parasitism are each implemented in 6 models or less albeit these features may provide a certain ecological realism necessary for era 3 4 suitability of models to assist the risk assessment of gene drives 3 4 1 most powerful models from this analysis the likely most powerful models in terms of versatility were selected to closer examine them according to their suitability to assist an era of gene drives the quantitative selection process was done by comparing the number of implemented features in models with spatial and stochastic capabilities see table s2 the selected models are the ones from north et al slim3 skeeter buster and mgdrive the model by north et al is a spatial stochastic or deterministic agent based simulation which covers a large geographic area of one million square miles it is directed at the life history of malaria vectors anopheles gambiae and a coluzzii the life history is implemented as two stages juvenile and adult adults are represented as males and multiple female stages of mate host or breeding site seeking so far publications focused on a meiotic sex distorter y drive north et al 2019 84 and a crispr cas based homing drive with a female infertility cargo gene north et al 2020 102 in simulated eight year time frames the model considers abiotic factors such as regional seasonality and perennial and non perennial water bodies as breeding sites for the target organism north and godfray 2018 each breeding site in the vicinity of human settlements is an agent biotic factors such as larval competition which acts as the density dependant carrying capacity migration aestivation and long distance migration are also considered by this model although especially these latter two parameters due to uncertainty rely more on assumptions rather than on field data the slim3 model haller and messer 2019 66 can be used in a deterministic or stochastic fashion and in a spatial and non spatial manner it is based on a wright fisher model but exceeds its predecessor by implementing age structured populations mate choice inherent offspring generation overlapping generations migration hard selection continuous space maps for different parameters and populations interactions with interaction strengths and radii genetics different types of mutations and individual organisms the so far published simulations examined heg drive champer et al 2018 champer et al 2020 53 97 crispr ta j champer et al 2020a 103 as well as four different underdominance variants j champer et al 2020b 105 all these published models have been generic although the model would allow customization towards the life history of a specific target organism the simulated time frames varied between 40 and 100 generations although slim3 would be a very versatile model this versatility comes at the price of a lack of modularity the continuous space can be defined with areas of parameter changes such as fitness population density and so on but it would prove difficult for an assessor to define real landscapes according to abstract terms of population dynamics likewise the software can be designed to accommodate specific target organisms which would be a challenging endeavour to do the skeeter buster magori et al 2009 13 software is a stochastic spatial model directed at aedes aegypti the model simulates individual water containers in 612 in fourfold copy of 153 households in iquitos peru legros et al 2011 18 each container is modelled with a water level nutrition and temperature those factors determine the larval weight and thereby development and competition weight also determines the fecundity and mating capability of adult mosquitoes the model distinguishes eggs larvae pupae and adult mosquitoes this software is the most detailed considering the life history of its target organism it features two modes of dispersal migration to neighbouring households or long distance 200 m by either adults or the displacement of entire containers furthermore different release strategies and weather conditions such as temperature precipitation and humidity from iquitos peru and buenos aires argentina have been considered legros et al 2011 18 medea and killer rescue legros et al 2013 25 as well as ridl and an anti pathogen gene were simulated with this model okamoto et al 2014 33 the modelling time frames were set between two to five years mgdrive sánchez c et al 2019 73 is a deterministic or stochastic spatial modelling software that has a modular build each model run consists of an inheritance cube module a life history module and a landscape module the inheritance cube module is designed according to the respective genetic system so far inheritance cubes exist for crispr based homing drives for replacement or suppression medea ridl wolbachia underdominance translocations sánchez c et al 2020 94 transcomplementing homing drive lópez del amo et al 2020 91 and a split heg drive li et al 2020 89 inheritance may also be linked to a set of sex specific variable parameters and emerging resistance alleles that can vary in fitness penalty and probability of occurrence the life history module works with lumped age class structures that may vary in a set of parameters and are predefined for a gambiae ae aegypti and c capitate the landscape module consists of a network of interconnected habitats migration probability between different habitats may be variably set finally release schemes specifying habitat size number frequency and beginning can be customized while the inheritance cube modules are quite detailed and comprehensive life history and landscapes seem to be covered rather superficially and more abstractly while other ecological factors are completely disregarded but the follow up version mgdrive 2 wu et al 2021 116 alleviated some of these issues as now life history and migration parameters can be changed over time furthermore additional inheritance cubes are included such as remediation systems chacr eracr and cleaver oberhofer et al 2019 most notably an epidemiology module was included that harbours a lumped class human population that can progress through the states of susceptible latently infected or infectious and in the case of arboviruses dengue also recovered likewise except for recovered the mosquitoes now possess the same denominators nevertheless the genetic component of the model remains the most elaborated module as opposed to the rather crude and abstract other modules 3 4 2 information requirements for gm insect releases by efsa and who there is still little guidance which specifically addresses the ra of gene drives however the efsa and the who both published guidance documents efsa 2013 who 2014 regarding the assessment of transgenic animals and transgenic mosquitoes these can be applied to the most advanced applications of gene drive in mosquitoes with the following analysis we do not want to imply that there is a need for a single model to address all aspects instead cross comparison of the results of multiple models may even be more reliable we also do not hold the position that the listed aspects of table 3 represent a valid exhaustive checklist even if models would cover all aspects we cannot make qualitative statements on their validity nor do we want to criticize the assessed models rather we use the guidance documents as indicators to illustrate the current status of modelling concerning era requirements according to efsa mathematical models used in era should provide information about its parameters verification validation sensitivity analysis and evaluation of unquantified uncertainties efsa panel on genetically modified organisms gmo 2013 pp 41 so far none of the models analysed presently can match these criteria however models do address some of the areas of risk for which information has to be provided to support the ra of transgenic insects efsa panel on genetically modified organisms gmo 2013 table 3 there are seven major areas of interest when assessing the release of a gm insect into the environment persistence and invasiveness vertical and horizontal gene transfer pathogens infections and diseases interactions between the gmo with target and non target organisms impacts on human and animal health and impacts on techniques for the management of gm insects efsa gmo panel 2013 chapter 4 2 corresponding to these major areas of risk there are specific characteristics that could potentially be predicted through modelling these are considered in table 3 where implemented features are denoted with a green check mark and un implemented features with a red cross mark as shown in table 3 current gene drive models at least partially consider abiotic factors as well as biotic factors related to the target organism such as reproductive biology fitness etc some gmo related biotic traits are also considered but with the exception of interactions with pathogens there are no models that consider interactions between the gm insect and non target organisms or food webs while 18 out of the 37 listed characteristics are addressed at least by single models 19 of the information elements were not included in models it may also be mentioned that some of the listed characteristics may simply not apply to gd in general or for specific applications the who guidance is more narrow in scope and is not focussed on gm insects but specifically on gm mosquitoes who tdr and fnih 2014 and are applicable for gene drives in fact it has been referred to by the national academies of sciences engineering and medicine in their work on gene drives national academies of sciences 2016 in this guidance document or its second edition two tables are provided on example parameters that may be relevant in laboratory studies and open field studies as part of the ra for transgenic mosquitoes who tdr and fnih et al 2021 tables 3 2 3 3 2014 tables 3 1 3 2 in table 4 we compiled parameters and checked similar to the efsa guideline whether the information elements have been covered by the models we analysed here orange check marks exemplify special cases explained below table 4 it is apparent that the who list comprises fewer characteristics than that of efsa one reason is the narrower scope of the who document and that efsa also considers impacts such as horizontal gene transfer hybridization and broader ecological interactions of species only four characteristics by the who are presently not covered by the sum of modelling approaches these are insecticide behavioural and biochemical resistance as well as mass rearing quality indices biochemical resistance means physiological changes to avoid or reduce the efficacy of conventional management mass rearing quality indices mean the low quality of gm insects due to inbreeding though it may be argued that the mass rearing quality indices are accounted for by the majority of models by implementing fitness costs the issue is likely more complex and would better be captured by the inclusion of inbreeding depression and hybrid vigour which are complex issues themselves 4 discussion our analysis of 117 publications shows that modelling gene drive properties is an important aspect of gd research since the earliest conception craig et al 1960 and first engineered synthetic gene drives chen et al 2007 with the advent of crispr cas jumpstarting heg based drives dicarlo et al 2015 gantz et al 2015 gantz and bier 2015 hammond et al 2016 there was a delayed spike in publications on model simulations of super mendelian inheritance beginning in 2017 in the analysed models application wise there is a focus on public health 55 models and mechanistically on heg based homing drives 54 models the most frequent study focus in the models is put on replacement 72 studies although many models are dedicated to a specific application the majority of the evaluated models are directed at generic target organisms 75 models mosquitoes as the exception however account for 25 of overall models and 72 of species specific models this is probably because gene drives in mosquitoes are thought to contribute to a reduction in vector borne disease which established mosquitoes as the model genus for gene drive research regarding their ability to reflect natural conditions most models are cautious about incorporating too much complexity they are kept comparably simple as deterministic and non spatial approaches 47 models and employ a mating system of perfect panmixis 73 models this coincides with the finding that most models are concerned with the efficacy of the respective drive system and are more focused on a proof of concept than on the ecological implications of the application context in all models analysed including the four models selected for closer comparative analysis traits relevant to interactions with other species are mostly absent an exception is the mgdrive model which can account for altered transmission range and frequency due to pathogens of the target organism or increased vector competence but also considers interactions with symbionts hosts and parasites 4 1 most versatile to date models cannot support the information needed for gene drive risk assessment we compared the versatility of models to better judge whether they can simulate complex environmental relationships and thus assist era the most versatile models were analysed in more detail for their ability to fulfil the complex requirements of era laid out by guidance documents of efsa and who efsa panel on genetically modified organisms gmo 2013 who tdr and fnih 2021 2014 on the one hand selected models already incorporate a number of abiotic and biotic factors but the characteristics covered by the selected models are strongly focused on predicting the spread of the gene drive and the impact on the population size of the target organism on the other hand comparing the models to guidance frameworks efsa and who illustrate that models currently fall short to include a wide range of processes needed for the ra in particular criteria such as the potential to explore new niches behavioural changes heterosis hybridization horizontal gene transfer trophic relationships interspecies competition and ecosystem services have not yet been considered in gene drive models these characteristics are repetitively subject to relevant pathways to harm in the problem formulation for gd mosquitoes connolly et al 2021 and will be important for modelling the ecological effects of synthetic gene drives in general with a focus on the spread of the gd and the target population general aspects of the target population and the gmo were included in the models however the selected models so far exclude very fundamental effects such as effects of the genetic modification on the interaction between gmos and the target organisms or effects on the fitness of hybrids similar deficits of important aspects of the target organism s biology are related to dispersal or the mating system verma et al 2023 which may be crucial to predicting the envisaged spread but will also be crucial for the fate of the gene drive in the environment 4 2 the necessary level of certainty of model predictions depends on the context of use while modelling approaches for efficacy testing and era pursue some overlapping goals they differ in the level of certainty they need to provide from the developer s perspective if it turns out that the actual efficacy of the drive is higher than expected in the models this will likely be an argument in favour of this new technology compared to predecessors such as sterile insect technology sit but from the perspective of ra any deviation from the predicted spread of the gene drive is critical the reason is that predictions on the temporal and spatial spread define exposure to the environment and thus must be considered key data to predict indirect effects on biodiversity even a failed gene drive with a low propensity to spread may remain in the environment also if synthetic gene drive systems are more effective than expected this might trigger enhanced spatial or temporal exposure with consequences which need to be assessed before a gene drive is released into the environment in this review we focus on the mere implementation of different features we however did not investigate the uncertainties related to these features which would be essential to characterize the risk assessment many aspects remain understudied since their decisive ecological contexts may be highly case specific and dependant on the respective ecosystem or habitat hence many field situations can be considered to be multifactorial with likely unknown or highly variable influence to account for this it is desirable for modellers to include more stochasticity which would allow them to increase the capacity to both simulate rare events and better estimate uncertainties however uncertainty will remain an important issue when using models to assist the risk assessment of gds and it is unclear which effects can be modelled with the necessary precision especially for long term effects in highly complex ecosystems one way to account for uncertainty may be the application of uncertainty or safety factors in analogy to the assessment of toxicological or eco toxicological effects from pharmaceuticals or pesticides however as the u s national research council has noted the unrecognized sources of uncertainty surprise and fundamental ignorance about the basic processes that drive risk are often important sources of uncertainty and formal analysis may not help if they are too large national research council 1996 p 5 4 3 dilemma to obtain data for model parametrisation and validation if models especially for the purpose to predict the spread and ecological effects in the environment are to be parametrized or validated field data are necessary while some data e g on the ecology and life history of target and non target species may cost considerable effort they can be obtained without a gene drive release data for model validation in contrast depend on field data gene drive organisms will always be genetically modified and as such regulated as gmos as the risk assessment and therefore model validation has to be carried out prior to full scale release gene drive organisms challenge the to date risk assessment concepts which foresee a stepwise release of gmos into the environment all field experiments for this purpose must be strictly limited in both time and space gene drives however may not easily be contained in field experiments where the escape of few individuals with an effective drive may have the consequences of an unlimited time lagged non reversible release into the environment esvelt and gemmell 2017 simon et al 2018 although it may be possible to extrapolate data from previous field releases of other bio control measures inevitably more field studies would necessarily need to be conducted to obtain reliable data for modelling 5 conclusions an era is considerably more complicated for gds compared to other categories of gmos simon et al 2018 models are considered important risk assessment tools for gene drives the objective of this article is to analyse how far current models can inform era where models are required to possess in depth ecological realism and reliably assess critical questions related to environmental risks taken together our results show that biological and ecological realism are still poorly realized in current models by reviewing the models we identified a set of less frequently implemented parameters assortative matings incest rate human action food sources predator prey relationships rare matings and mutualism parasitism that can help enhance ecological realism in this regard cross comparisons of various models may help quantify uncertainties moreover to assess the effects of releasing synthetic gene drives like all gmos there is a need to study all levels of organization from genetics to species population and landscape including their interactions gene drive models are in a dilemma as field releases to obtain data are difficult to perform due to their intended ability to spread in the environment thus to model environmental effects more complexity must be accounted for by modelling approaches verma et al 2021 other novel forms of invasive environmental biotechnology such as transmissible vaccines or horizontal environmental genetic alteration agents reeves et al 2018 will likely suffer from the same dilemma while modelling efficacy is a blooming and developing field modelling ecological effects is like in many other fields still in its infancy this is owed to the complexity of the task see above to solve this issue we propose to develop specific models aimed at evaluating ecological effects instead of efficacy in order to assist era modelling per se is a highly valuable tool which is already used in the era for gmos pesticides or toxicants baudrot et al 2021 efsa panel on plant protection products and their residues ppr et al 2018 fahse et al 2018 perry et al 2012 ziółkowska et al 2021 however in the case of gene drives risk assessors and risk managers have not agreed on concepts methods endpoints or data requirements to use such models we assume it will take considerable effort and time to achieve this national and international harmonization harmonisation will also be necessary for monitoring activities of gene drive applications which will be demanding long term and costly even though ecological realism in modelling is important for era it is important to remember that extrapolations from models can only serve as rough guides and will also in the future likely be far from being able to simulate the complexity of the environment

24241,as an important external supervision force the impact of the media on the process and effect of local environmental governance is gradually deepening and expanding this study constructs a four party evolutionary game model of local environmental governance with the central government local government pollutant discharging enterprises and the public as the game parties on this basis media attention factors are introduced and its impact on local environmental governance is verified through comparative analysis our aim is to build a more clear and comprehensive research framework of local environmental governance to analyze the impact of media attention on local government environmental governance behavior and results and to explore the mechanism of its impact and then considering the media s attention to local government environmental governance put forward the idea of optimizing the local environmental governance in china the research found that 1 media attention reinforces the status of local governments and enterprises as key participants and affects the stability of the equilibrium points mainly by affecting the environmental behaviors of these two parties but has no effect on the strategic choices of the central government 2 negative exposure in the media will strengthen the propensity of key players to choose positive environmental strategies and show a substitution effect on public surveillance 3 media attention can effectively prevent and moderate negative externalities in local environmental governance 4 the participation of the media disguised the public into its scattered elements in the process of environmental supervision the public acted as the organization and blood of the mainstream media to a certain extent using public opinion to force the government and enterprises to take appropriate remedial measures to improve environmental conditions thereby significantly improving the efficiency of public participation in local environmental governance this study enriches the research on the role of the media in the local environmental governance and provides new environmental governance ideas under the attention of the media which is helpful for the exploration of improving the efficiency of local environmental governance keywords media attention local environmental governance four party evolutionary game numerical simulation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction after the reform and opening up china s rapid economic progress is accompanied by a huge energy overdraft and serious environmental pollution environmental problems have become a major resistance to social development yang et al 2022a yang 2022b li et al 2019 local environmental governance directly determines whether china s environmental pollution problems can be properly solved or not which in turn affects whether china s ecological civilization construction can be effectively implemented china continues to increase its investment in environmental control in 2020 the total investment in environmental pollution control in china was 1 06389 trillion yuan with the exception of tibet qinghai hainan and ningxia the total investment in environmental pollution control in the other 27 provinces and cities all exceeded 10 billion yuan the state pays more and more attention to the construction of environmental protection however under the situation of overall improvement and partial deterioration of the environment dealing with the environmental reports and environmental group incidents become a challenging task for the government in social governance zhang 2020 public data in early 2022 show that in 2020 relying on the national eco environmental complaint management platform a total of 231297 telephone reports 204483 wechat reports and 33327 online reports were collected china s environmental governance is the result of the joint participation of multiple parties in addition to the traditional participants such as the central government local governments enterprises and the public the media as the important external force is gradually deepening and expanding their impact on the local environmental governance as of june 2022 china s internet penetration rate reached 74 4 cnnic 2022 under the positive promotion of media exposure a large number of environmental problems and lack of governance responsibilities have been presented to the public for example the private cofferdam incident in dongting lake exposed by xinhua in june 2018 and the tengger desert pollution incident exposed by the beijing news in september 2014 and so on as an important subsystem of social governance structure media has grown into a necessary tool for innovative social governance the research on the influence mechanism of media on local government environmental governance can comply with the new requirements of local government environmental governance extend the decision mechanism of social governance and provide theoretical basis and practical guidance for promoting the coordinated development of economy and environment at present china implements a goal oriented environmental policy and adopts top down stress governance goron and bolsover 2020 in terms of the government under the background of chinese style decentralization there is an obvious principal agent relationship of environmental governance between the central government and the local government wang 2021 wang et al 2021 as for enterprises environmental protection objectives are delegated from the central level and polluting enterprises become the end of the environmental governance system the specific implementers of environmental protection policies and the key regulatory objects of local environmental governance in the aspect of public participation researchers have long reached a consensus on the importance of encouraging participatory governance and fully releasing the power of public participation to environmental governance chu et al 2022 yao et al 2020 although there are shortcomings in professionalism and accuracy as a decentralized independent not easy to game and political manipulation of the accountability system public supervision s positive effect on environmental governance has still been recognized by the academic community munro 2021 wang 2013 as one of the important subjects of environmental governance the media also has the right to choose whether to conduct environmental supervision which depends on the environmental supervision level of the local government and the media s measurement of its own costs and benefits mazzarino et al 2020 it is in the balance of this dual nature that the media influences local environmental governance first the media has wide coverage strong penetration and great influence which affects the level of investment in environmental governance and the adjustment of environmental regulation pan and wei 2019 s secondly the media helps to construct the national ecological environment public opinion construct the discourse system induce and shape the audience s environmental cognition which also reflects the subjectivity of the media in the construction of the public opinion field chen and zhao 2022 finally the media plays a role in supervising enterprises and media reports magnify corporate social responsibility to promote prudent production which can positively promote environmental research and development su et al 2022 game theory can more reasonably describe all kinds of game interaction in the real world so it is widely used in economics biology sociology and other fields for example nikoleta et al constructed a two party evolutionary game model to study the devaluation of rhino horn nikoleta et al 2018 han et al studied derivation of species interactions strength in a plant community by using evolutionary game theory han et al 2019 chen and bao studied the strategic game between predator and prey chen and bao 2022 game theory has advantages over other artificial intelligence methods in computational complexity the idea of using game theory to study environmental problems has been accepted and recognized by academic circles olatinwo and joubert 2022 among them the evolutionary game theory is adopted by more and more researchers because its premise is closer to the reality of environmental governance which is mainly used to explore the optimal interaction model among the participants in the environmental governance system the application of evolutionary game method in the field of environmental governance started from the initial two party game and it is still one of the mainstream choices to use game method to analyze environmental problems for example wu et al applied evolutionary game theory to construct a government enterprise evolutionary game model of low carbon strategy in complex networks research shows that enterprises expectations of government incentives including subsidies and regulation determine the speed at which low carbon strategies can be promoted and spread wu et al 2017 luo et al constructed an evolutionary game model of corporate environmental governance cooperation behavior by using evolutionary games in complex networks the conclusion is that under the self organizing evolution of environmental governance of enterprise groups the cooperation level of environmental governance will eventually reach a lower level luo et al 2020 at present the vast majority of researchers in this research field generally use an advanced version of the tripartite evolutionary game method to analyze more complex environmental behavior interactions for example singh and mukherjee studied the roles of project execution related to environmental impact in organizations and enterprises portfolio manager project manager and environmental manager established a tripartite evolutionary game model and deduced the punishment reward system of environmental protection project execution singh and mukherjee 2022 aghmashhadi et al constructed a tripartite game model of industrial land development conflict which is composed of the ministry of environment industrial and mining organizations and planning and budget organizations according to the study it is necessary to reform the decision making system itself in order to make participants take environmental factors into account in the decision making preference of land development aghmashhadi et al 2022 xu et al discussed the influence of evolutionary stability strategy on the development of electric shipbuilding industry by using tripartite evolutionary game model and considered that under the condition of random initial probability the optimal strategy combination is that both upstream and downstream governments take the initiative to regulate and shipping enterprises in neighboring provinces use clean energy xu et al 2021 yu et al constructed a tripartite evolutionary game model based on stakeholder theory and found that when local governments adopt control strategies for new media new media seek truth from facts and local people adopt non boycott strategies local government intervention in rumors will help to promote new media to publicize the facts of nimby facility pollution and restrict local people s choice of boycott strategies yu et al 2021 in recent years in the field of environmental governance a small number of researchers have gradually tried to use the four party evolutionary game method to carry out the research on environmental problems and realized the further progress of the application research of the game method yang et al established a four party evolutionary game model of energy reporting and regulation which includes the central energy regulatory agencies local energy regulatory agencies energy companies and whistleblowers the results show that public supervision and whistleblowers help to reduce the opportunity cost of inspection by central energy regulators and public active whistleblowers can effectively stimulate the active supervision of local regulators and compliance emissions of energy companies yang et al 2022c yang constructs a four party evolutionary game model of cross regional environmental governance between the two neighboring places the central government and the public it is found that the central policy guidance and the pollution discharge behavior of the adjacent areas lead to the public whistling to protect their rights and the high degree of public participation promotes the level of environmental governance in the adjacent areas yang et al 2022d pan et al constructed a four party evolutionary game model of environmental governance of the central government local government enterprises and the public and used numerical simulation to simulate the influence of parameter changes on the stability strategies of different players in the game system pan et al 2022 it is worth mentioning that among the few four party game studies the research of yang et al 2022a and pan et al 2022 has some similarities with this study mainly in that we are to use the four party evolutionary game model focusing on the top down supervision mechanism and bottom up reporting mechanism to analyze the environmental behavior interaction between the central and local governments or departments the public and enterprises and other environmental governance subjects the numerical simulation analysis method is used to verify and dig deep into the model the differences between this study and previous studies are as follows 1 on the basis of general quadripartite interaction analysis this study tries to design media attention as an external pressure a comparative analysis is made on the basis of the construction of two four party evolutionary game models with and without media attention b previous studies have focused on the analysis of influencing factors studying the impact of the changes of multiple parameters on the strategy of participants and the stability of the system the purpose of this study is to analyze the influence mechanism of media attention on the behavior strategies of local environmental governance participants in addition the research of pan et al 2019 is highly consistent with the theme of this study trying to explore the relationship between media attention and environmental governance the difference is that they use econometric analysis to study the impact of media attention on local environmental governance investment while this study uses game analysis to explore the influence mechanism of media attention on the environmental behavior strategies of local environmental governance subjects reviewing the literature we find that in the existing research few researchers put the forces of government enterprise public media and other environmental governance into the same game analysis framework for comprehensive game analysis and there are few research results on the relationship between media attention and local environmental governance and pay little attention to the role of media as an external supervision force evolutionary game theory is more suitable to the local government environmental governance problem studied in this paper and it is an ideal research tool this study uses the four party game model to carry out theoretical analysis which is the application of the latest stage results of game analysis the purpose of this study is to introduce the external influence of media attention into the general local government environmental governance system in order to explore the role and mechanism of media attention on local government environmental governance and then consider how to coordinate various stakeholders under the attention of the media reasonable adjustment of governance strategies in order to better deal with environmental problems and improve the efficiency of local environmental governance on the basis of previous research we expect to make some contributions from the following two aspects 1 several most representative participants in local environmental governance are selected as the research object and the forces of government enterprise public and media in environmental governance are put into the same framework for comprehensive game analysis a four party evolutionary game model of local environmental governance is constructed 2 we introduce the external impact of media attention and make a theoretical model analysis on the effect and influence mechanism of media on local environmental governance which not only enriches the theoretical basis of related research but also provides ideas for specific environmental governance practice the rest of this article is arranged as follows the second and third sections are methods the second section constructs the four party evolutionary game model of local environmental governance and analyzes the evolutionary stability strategy the third section adds media attention factors to carry out model reconstruction and evolutionary stability strategy analysis the fourth section is the simulation analysis and the result discussion respectively carries on the numerical simulation to the benchmark model and the supplementary model evolution process and launches the comparative analysis and discussion the fifth section summarizes the main conclusions of this paper puts forward the corresponding optimization ideas and reflects on the shortcomings of this study 2 benchmark model construction and stability analysis the main participants in china s local environmental governance system include the central government local governments pollution discharging enterprises and the public by depicting the interaction of environmental behavior among these four parties the basic situation of local environmental governance can be presented 2 1 basic model assumptions according to evolutionary game theory the following three basic preconditions must be satisfied for the four party evolutionary game model to be constructed p1 all players the central government local governments enterprises and the public are bounded rationality the central government s goal is to maximize social welfare the local government s goal is to maximize local political and economic benefits the enterprise s goal is to maximize its own economic profits and the public s goal is to maximize its own rights and interests all parties choose environmental behavior strategies from the perspective of maximizing their own utility and the games are played at the same time in no particular order p2 there are two strategies for each of the four game parties to choose from central government strict supervision loose supervision local government strict regulation lax regulation pollution discharging enterprises active pollution control passive pollution control the public complete participation incomplete participation p3 the probability of the central government choosing a strict supervision strategy is x 0 x 1 and the probability of loose supervision is 1 x the probability that the local government chooses a strict regulation strategy is y 0 y 1 and the probability of not strict regulation is 1 y the probability of active pollution control strategy of enterprises is z 0 z 1 then the probability of passive pollution control is 1 z the probability of the public s complete participation in the strategy of environmental governance is w 0 w 1 and the probability of incomplete participation is 1 w combined with the actual situation of local environmental governance in china we describe the benchmark model in detail and propose model assumptions h1 when the central government adopts a strict supervision strategy it means that the central government will strictly urge local governments to implement environmental regulations when adopting the relaxed supervision strategy the representative localities are given a considerable degree of discretion and the local governments make their own decisions according to the requirements of environmental policies and the actual situation the central government determines whether to impose punishment f administrative accountability or political punishment on each local government according to the results of local performance appraisal while the measurement of local environmental performance depends on the local government s environmental regulation strength and the cooperation of enterprises within its jurisdiction the strength λ 1 of central government oversight will affect the central government s supervision cost c 1 α and β are the influence coefficients of the local environmental quality level and economic development level on the national overall level respectively h2 when the local government adopts the strategy of strict regulation it will strictly control the environmental protection tasks regardless of the cost c 2 of environmental regulation implementation so there is an opportunity cost c 0 for the local government to focus on economic development along with the improvement of environmental conditions e while the local government obtains the benefits b including environmental performance bonus points and public satisfaction improvement it also brings indirect benefits ω l of social governance to the public moreover the local government will reward the enterprise b or impose a fine f far exceeding the enterprise s illegal income according to the pollution control performance of the enterprise the lax regulation strategy adopted by the local government means that the environmental regulation is not fully implemented the local government may be under pressure from local financial pressure the realization of local economic development goals local government competition and comprehensive political performance and then relax regulations and provide insufficient incentives for environment friendly enterprises and privately lower the penalty standards for bad enterprises resulting in environmental losses l public rights loss φ l in addition the negative environmental behaviors of local governments are more likely to be investigated and punished under the strict supervision of the central government 0 v u 1 the local government s enforcement strength λ 2 will affect its regulation cost and the level of rewards and punishments for enterprises h3 when a pollutant discharging enterprise chooses the active pollution control strategy it means that the enterprise takes clean production as the basic production requirement conducts environmental monitoring on its own voluntarily conducts energy conservation and emission reduction actively explores green production technologies and minimizes the negative external effects of production this move brings environmental performance bonus p to the local government and also partially offsets the negative externality losses caused by productive pollution to the public set ω e as the offset amount and set r as the legal production benefit of the enterprise when the passive pollution control strategy is chosen it means that the enterprise ignores its social responsibility for environmental protection and puts its own economic interests first the local government will bear the environmental performance loss q and the public will also suffer the corresponding negative externality loss φ e the level of effort λ 3 of enterprises to reduce emissions affects the enterprises conscious pollution control investment c 3 and the amount of public losses enterprises decide their own production models according to the strictness of local government regulations the condition for enterprises to passively control pollution is that their illegal income is enough to compensate the cost of their pollution control r e c 3 only when the enterprise is reported will it improve the production method and pay the passive rectification cost δ c 3 including the cost of new pollution control before being investigated and the cost of technical improvement after the investigation δ c 3 c 3 passive pollution control enterprises have a higher probability of being investigated and punished when the local government is strictly regulated 0 q p 1 strictly regulated local governments will impose penalties on enterprises that are greater than the illegal profits of enterprises f r e h4 the complete participation strategy adopted by the public means that the public is generally highly concerned about environmental issues a considerable proportion of members in the group spontaneously supervise the environmental performance of local governments and pollutant discharging enterprises and have an impact on the effect of environmental governance when problems are discovered they will consciously report and give feedback put pressure on relevant parties and express their expectations for rectification the public s incomplete participation strategy means that the public generally has low sensitivity and attention to environmental issues lacks the motivation to supervise and takes a wait and see attitude towards the local government s environmental governance the public s level of attention to the local government s environmental governance λ 4 reflects the public s willingness to participate in environmental governance and affects the public s supervision and reporting costs c 4 such as time spent physical effort and material and spiritual burdens the public s successful reporting about the relevant local departments will cause additional losses δ c 2 to the local government including the cost of organizational rectification and the decline of the government s credibility while the public indirectly recovers the incomplete social governance benefits with a proportion of h if the public successfully reports an enterprise the enterprise will suffer additional penalties δ f and reputation loss n from the local government while the public will receive incomplete environmental benefits and local government incentives h l considering that government enterprise collusion will greatly reduce the success rate of the public in reporting enterprises it is assumed that when there is no government enterprise collusion and the information reported by the public is verified the report is deemed successful 2 2 benchmark model construction according to the above model assumptions the payoff matrix of the four player game model of local environmental governance without media attention can be obtained as shown in table 1 2 3 model derivation and equilibrium point stability analysis suppose the fitness of the central government to choose the strict supervision strategy is f a 1 the fitness of the loose supervision strategy is f a 2 and f a is the average fitness then 1 f a 1 y z w π 1 1 y z 1 w π 2 1 y 1 z w π 3 1

1 z 1 w π 16 1 3 f a x f a 1 1 x f a 2 according to the malthusian equation the quantitative growth rate of the central government s choice of strict supervision strategy is equal to the difference between its fitness and the average fitness substituting into the corresponding expression of payment value can obtain the replication dynamic equation of the central government s strict supervision strategy 4 x x f a 1 f a x 1 x 1 y u v λ 1 f λ 1 1 c 1 similarly the replication dynamic equations of the other three parties can be obtained separately and the four dimensional dynamic system i of local environmental governance without media attention can be obtained simultaneously as follows let x 0 y 0 z 0 w 0 solve the system i to get 16 pure strategy equilibrium points 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1

to each pure strategy equilibrium point of the four dimensional dynamic system according to the first method of lyapunov when all eigenvalues of matrix j have negative real parts it can be determined that system i is asymptotically stable at this point and the corresponding strategy combination is the evolutionary stable strategy of system i after analyzing one by one it can be determined that there are 9 stable points in the 16 equilibrium points the results are shown in table 2 ⅰ stability analysis of equilibrium point e 1 at point e 1 0 0 0 0 the equilibrium is asymptotically stable if

negative environmental behavior strategies in the light of their relative benefits local governments are powerless to regulate while the central government relaxes its supervision over local governments allowing enterprises to unrestrictedly discharge pollutants and the public is forced to accept the negative externalities of environmental degradation this corresponds to the phenomenon of government failure and market failure in reality and the entire local environmental governance dynamic system remains inefficient this point is not an ideal stable equilibrium point ⅰi stability

compensate for a series of costs of enterprises under the passive pollution control strategy this leads to a positive relative income of enterprises under the active pollution control strategy and active pollution control has become the best choice for enterprises given the good performance of enterprises local governments give them appropriate incentives and tend to relax environmental

when the government relaxes supervision enterprises can still take the initiative to control pollution and the public is also willing to advise the local government however in reality pollutant discharging enterprises are oriented by economic interests and have moral hazard while the public is easily constrained by government enterprise conspiracy and has limited power therefore it is difficult to maintain the harmonious situation of the government s governing by inaction for a long time only by relying on the environmental protection consciousness of enterprises and the enthusiasm

supervision strategy and a strict regulation strategy which brings positive relative returns at this time there is a high probability that the illegal discharge behavior of enterprises will be investigated and punished and the losses will far exceed the illegal income of them active pollution control is the best choice for enterprises given that both local governments and polluters have chosen active environmental strategies to work together to minimize environmental losses the public is highly satisfied with local governments environmental governance performance considering that participation in environmental governance will not bring benefits to the public and under the same benefits the public can obtain less cost and more relative benefits by adopting an incomplete participation strategy so the public tends to incomplete participation this situation depicts the optimal operating state of the local environmental governance system that is there is no need for the central government to strengthen supervision local governments still strictly implement environmental regulations enterprises consciously take the initiative to control pollution as well as the public has a sense of security in the protection of their own environmental rights and interests without additional environmental supervision costs which is the optimal allocation of social resources vi

compared with the previous situation while the strict supervision of the central government continues to increase the cost of supervision the public can bring relative benefits to themselves under the

the complete participation of the public has very limited effect on turning the situation around the operation effect of the local environmental governance system is still not ideal which is a less

strategy and the profit oriented pollutant discharging enterprises will steadily adopt the active pollution control strategy as the front end practitioners of local environmental governance the positive environmental behaviors of enterprises play a decisive role in the improvement of environmental quality which constitutes one of the important reasons for the relaxation of local government regulations at this time the central government may increase the incentives to urge local governments to increase their enthusiasm for implementing environmental regulations and the public does not have enough motivation to report when their environmental rights and interests are basically guaranteed and the losses of environmental damage are basically minimized this point is a relatively ideal

based on the good performance of enterprises and the relative interests of local governments themselves in this case in the absence of strict regulations by local governments enterprises can still take the initiative to control pollution and the public is also willing to urge local governments to strengthen environmental regulations from the perspective of long term evolution local governments may be forced to reverse the negative strategy due to top down pressure from the central government and bottom up negative feedback from the public this point is a relatively ideal stable equilibrium point 3 model reconstruction and stability analysis 3 1 supplementary model assumptions the media infiltrates the entire local environmental governance system as a supervisor and media attention will dramatically expand the negative impact of environmental issues setting media interventions are reflected in media influencing and changing the environmental behavior of other participants and then introduce media factors to reconstruct the benchmark model and make supplementary assumptions h5 assume that the media s reflection of environmental facts is objective individuals tend to react more strongly to negative information than to positive information so that the media is more willing to report and criticize negative events out of consideration for economic benefits media attention will bring high exposure r u r 1 p r 1 for negative environmental behaviors h6 after local environmental issues are exposed by the media the central government will increase the cost m 1 of dispatching inspectors focusing on under performing local governments h7 after the ineffective environmental regulation of local governments was exposed local governments are forced to bear internal rectification costs including organizational improvement costs and government public relations costs and a large number of external costs including substantial loss of credibility loss of government image and possible associated local economic and employment losses etc set k as the local governments internal and external media pressure cost h8 after the enterprises bad environmental behaviors are exposed the local government will increase the cost m 2 of environmental regulation and enterprises under investigation will pay a huge cost of benefit loss that is far greater than its illegal income t including additional punishment by the local government passive rectification costs loss of corporate reputation and public relations costs h9 various media exposure platforms can remove some of the blind spots of environmental problems for the public and at the same time help them to speak out about the environment which comprehensively lowers the threshold for the public to participate in local environmental governance assume that the overall cost of public participation is reduced to d 0 d c 4 3 2 model reconstruction after adding the above assumptions and adjusting the benchmark model a new payoff matrix of the four parties evolutionary game of local environmental governance can be reconstructed considering the impact of media attention as shown in table 3 3 3 stability analysis of equilibrium points when the media attention factor is included the derivation process of the new model is the same as the evolution derivation path of the benchmark model in the previous section first the four dimensional dynamic system ii of local environmental governance considering the factors of media attention is obtained 7 x x 1 x y 1 λ 1 m 1 λ 1 1 c 1 m 1 y y 1 y 1 z w λ 2 1 ξ h l 1 z λ 2 1 m 2 r f z λ 2 1 b λ 2 1 c 2 c 0 r f e b l k z z 1 z y b r f λ 3 1 c 3 r e λ 2 b r f t w w 1 w y 1 z 1 λ 2 ξ h l 1 y h ω l 1 z ξ λ 2 h l h ω e λ 4 1 d then the jacobian matrix j corresponding to system ii is obtained by calculating the first order partial derivatives of the obtained replicated dynamic equations let x 0 y 0 z 0 w 0 find 16 pure strategy equilibrium points 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 and substitute them into the jacobian matrix j to obtain the eigenvalues corresponding to each pure strategy equilibrium point of system ii finally the first method of lyapunov is used to judge the stability of system ii at each point when all eigenvalues are negative the equilibrium point can be judged to be asymptotically stable and the corresponding strategy combination is the evolutionary stability strategy ess of the system after screening and judgment it can be determined that there is only a unique asymptotically stable equilibrium point e 7 0 1 1 0 in the system ii as shown in table 4 the stability conditions are λ 1 1 c 1 0 1 λ 2 c 2 c 0 b r f e b l k 0 1 λ 3 c 3 r e b r f t 0 λ 4 1 d 0 and the corresponding strategy combination loose supervision strict regulation active pollution control incomplete participation is the only evolutionary stability strategy ess of system ii for the central government the cost of strict supervision is greater than the cost of loose supervision under the same income so it tends to loose supervision because of the positive relative income media exposure increases the probability that local governments and enterprises will be investigated and punished by their superiors for adopting negative environmental protection behaviors and leads to negative relative returns for the two under negative strategies therefore local governments choose to strictly supervise and enterprises choose to actively control pollution although the media attention has greatly improved the public s environmental awareness and provided a cheap and efficient channel for environmental monitoring in reality there are relatively few cases where the public needs to report and the public can obtain positive relative benefits under the incomplete participation strategy in the long run the complete participation strategy will not bring additional benefits to the public group so the public generally tends to be silent in this case the central government does not need to strengthen environmental supervision because under the all round supervision of the media the key players in local environmental governance local governments and pollutant discharging enterprises are magnified the possible losses under their negative environmental behavior strategies local governments choose strict regulations and enterprises consciously take the initiative to control pollution so that the public s environmental rights and interests can be adequately guaranteed to a certain extent 4 numerical simulation and sensitivity analysis based on the actual situation under the premise of ensuring that the specific economic significance is met combined with the assumptions of the model this study refers to the assignment method in the relevant literature to assign the parameters in the model rationally jin et al 2022 chu et al 2019 with the help of matlab r2016b the numerical simulation of system i and ii is carried out respectively so that the impact of media attention on local environmental governance and its mode of action can be visualized 4 1 simulation of evolution path of benchmark model set the initial time as 0 the end time as 30 and the initial probability as 0 5 0 5 0 5 0 5 and draw the two dimensional evolution paths of the environmental behavior strategies of the four players corresponding to the 9 conditionally stable equilibrium points of the benchmark model respectively in order to present the equilibrium strategy tendency of each party under the initial probability as can be seen from the images corresponding to the 9 equilibrium points of system i the strategy tendency curves of each player have different degrees of fluctuation and oscillation in the early stage of evolution specifically under the measure of its relative returns the central government s strategy is to resolutely converge on strict supervision or loose supervision and there is no repetition or fluctuation in various situations however the environmental strategies of local governments and enterprises show significant volatility characteristics especially under non ideal e1 and less than ideal e2 e3 e4 e9 and e10 conditions since there is no media amplification effect on various negative impacts there is still room for speculation among the three parties other than the central government in the process of choosing environmental strategies the quality of local environmental governance depends largely on the environmental strategies of local governments and pollutant discharging enterprises but public participation has limited power to shake up key players decision making so the public s strategy evolution process is relatively stable ① discussion on the optimal state of environmental governance of local government at the stable equilibrium point e 7 0 1 1 0 the participants in local environmental governance have obvious environmental behavior strategy tendency from the early stage of evolution and complete the evolutionary stability of their respective strategy choices in 5 units of time as shown in fig 1 among them pollutant discharging enterprises and local governments stabilize the strategies of active pollution control and strict regulation respectively and the central government tends to loose supervision strategies almost synchronously with the positive environmental governance performance of local governments as the end link and main feedback in the chain of local environmental governance system the public tends to the strategy of incomplete participation at a slower speed it can be seen that system i has realized the arrangement of environmental behavior strategies of the four players in a very short time and the whole local government environmental governance system has reached the most efficient and reasonable environmental governance cooperation situation at e7 ② discussion on the relatively ideal state of local government environmental governance as is shown in fig 2 at the stable equilibrium points e 11 1 0 1 0 and e 12 1 0 1 1 as the actual practitioners of environmental protection tasks the pollutant discharging enterprises tend to take the initiative to control pollution so that the environmental interests of the public are protected to a certain extent and then choose the strategy of incomplete participation however in the absence of bottom up pressure on environmental governance local governments have decisively relaxed their environmental regulations the central government s strict environmental supervision strategy is only to balance the focus of work between local governments environmental governance tasks and other tasks such as economic development at this time the overall performance of local environmental governance is good but the completion and effect of the actual environmental governance depends more on the consciousness of the relevant enterprises and the weak supervision and feedback of the public ③ discussion on the less ideal state of local government environmental governance at the stable equilibrium point e 2 0 0 0 1 as shown in fig 3 the central government does not pay more attention to local environmental governance so local governments and polluters decisively choose negative environmental behavior strategies in this case the public intends to change the weak situation of local environmental governance through high frequency negative environmental feedback at this time the focus of the social governance is not on environmental protection only the public who always have the demand for a healthy living environment are actively trying to reverse the situation but with little success at the stable equilibrium points e 3 0 0 1 0 and e 4 0 0 1 1 as shown in fig 4 in view of the fact that the pollutant discharging enterprises decisively choose to control pollution actively the local government quickly relaxes its environmental regulation after a short period of strict regulation and the public may gradually tend to incomplete participation strategy because of the environmentally friendly performance of enterprises or slowly tend to complete participation strategy because of the inaction of local governments in environmental governance and in order to protect the public s own environmental rights on the whole the common point of the evolution of system i at the equilibrium point e2 e3 and e4 lies in the absolute relaxation of environmental control by the government local environmental protection mainly depends on economic interest oriented enterprises and the public with limited influence and the social efficiency is low and there are potential risks that are not conducive to local environmental governance as shown in fig 5 at the stable equilibrium point e 9 1 0 0 0 the local government almost gives up its function of environmental regulation and allows the pollutant discharging enterprises to engage in production activities under the passive pollution control strategy all the participants in the local environmental governance system except the central government choose the negative environmental strategy at the stable equilibrium point e 10 1 0 0 1 in view of the negative environmental behavior of local governments and pollutant discharging enterprises the public has sufficient reason and motivation to report that is the public participate completely in environmental governance system i in the evolution process of e9 and e10 as the key participants of local environmental governance the local government and pollutant discharging enterprises are completely negative to environmental governance which makes the whole local environmental governance system almost shut down the operation of the system mainly depends on the increasing investment of environmental supervision from the central government which is not enough to mobilize the enthusiasm of key participants local governments and enterprises in the pollution control industry ④ discussion on the unsatisfactory state of local government environmental governance at the stable equilibrium point e 1 0 0 0 0 whether the government enterprises or the public the choice of environmental behavior strategies fluctuated sharply in the first 20 units of time but tended to be stable after 20 units of time as is shown in fig 6 this means that in the early stage of evolution the environmental behavior strategy of the four players is wavering and the choice of environmental behavior strategy is gradually determined after a relatively long period of wait and see and trade off it can be found that the two key participants tend to choose positive environmental strategies from the very beginning that is local governments strictly carry out environmental regulation and pollutant discharging enterprises take the initiative to control pollution in view of this the central government gradually relaxes environmental supervision and the enthusiasm of public participation in reporting is not enough to be fully mobilized however with the passage of time in view of the relaxation of supervision by the central government the local government gradually took the lead in reducing the strictness of its environmental regulation which led to the tendency of pollutant discharging enterprises to shift from active pollution control to passive pollution control at this time the local government turned to improve the rigor of its environmental regulation in order to maintain its own environmental governance performance and the enterprises turned to the active pollution control strategy a situation of catching up with each other with inconsistent frequency has been formed between local governments and enterprises in this process the tendency of public participation in environmental governance has rebounded from a low degree of participation to a certain extent but it is unable to change the situation of speculative competition between local governments and enterprises finally with the negative strategy tendency of the two gradually same frequency it fell back to the incomplete participation strategy however due to the location limitations and relative information disadvantages of the central government the game competition of other participants in the early stage is not enough for the central government to adjust its environmental supervision strategy on the whole at the equilibrium point e1 the interaction of environmental behavior among the participants of local environmental governance fell into a vicious circle and finally the four participants chose negative environmental behavior strategies one after another the whole system fell into the state of market failure and government failure 4 2 sensitivity analysis under the same initial probability time and step size we draw the evolution paths of the most ideal point e7 of system i and the unique stable point e7 of system ii respectively and conduct a sensitivity analysis of media attention factors through comparative simulation the simulation results are shown in fig 7 when the media attention is added to the local government environmental governance system there is only one of the nine stable equilibrium points of the original system i in the system ii and the only one corresponds to the most ideal stable equilibrium point in the system i thus it can be seen that the media s attention to environmental issues will cause the whole local government environmental governance system to converge sharply to the optimal mode of operation in the natural state comparing the optimal evolution path of system i and system ii it is found that due to the existence of media attention the response time of some participants to adopt their own environmental strategies has changed significantly while the strategy choices of some participants are not significantly affected by media attention specifically ①as key participants local governments and pollutant discharging enterprises will choose positive environmental behavior strategies at a faster speed the possible reason is that due to the media s external supervision of local government environmental governance and the media s gaze on the actual mode of production of pollutant discharge enterprises coupled with the huge network of environmental and social supervision and feedback woven by the media the cost of lax regulation by local governments and passive pollution control by enterprises is not limited to controllable losses forcing them to improve their strategic tendency to environmental behavior ②the involvement of the media in the environmental governance of local governments slows down the speed at which the public chooses incomplete participation strategies the addition of media power expands the participants and paths of environmental governance and with the help of the media it satisfies the increasingly strong desire of the public to participate in environmental decision making environmental supervision and safeguarding environmental rights and interests and the efficiency of the media is geometrically improved in this case although the public generally takes a wait and see attitude towards the environmental governance work of local governments the existence of the media can make the public fully participate in the strategic tendency to hold a considerable stickiness in addition media attention provides the necessary sense of security for public environmental supervision and acts as a powerful tool for the public to participate in local environmental governance showing a substitute effect on the function of public supervision ③the change range of the central government s environmental behavior strategy tendency is not obvious and it is almost not affected by the media attention factors the environmental supervision of the central government is mainly carried out by the local government which is the agent of its environmental governance task and the environmental governance task undertaken by the local government is only one of all tasks therefore in an ideal local government environmental governance model the central government should maintain appropriate attention to local government environmental governance rather than absolutely strict monitoring and inspection thus media pressure only affects the key participants in local government environmental governance local governments and enterprises and other stakeholders the public but has no impact on the decision making of the central government the external supervision of media is mainly reflected in that the costs to be paid by local governments and pollutant discharging enterprises under the negative environmental strategy increase sharply and cannot be easily absorbed by the corresponding subjects thereby breaking the original equilibrium in the corresponding situation which prompting the local government and enterprises to adjust their strategies and tilt towards positive environmental behavior the strategy of the central government mainly depends on the relative relationship between its environmental monitoring costs and overall political benefits and is not affected by media attention moreover in view of the benign situation of local environmental governance the central government has more decisively relaxed the supervision to local environmental governance led by local governments compared with the government and enterprises various media exposure platforms have made the public more powerful than ever the public s concerns about government enterprise collusion and the subsequent hidden dangers of reporting have been dispelled and they have gained confidence in the supervision of environmental issues with its powerful external supervision and high communication efficiency the media has exacerbated the weakening of traditional public reporting channels in the long term evolution on the surface it is an alternative to public environmental supervision but in essence it is an advanced step for public participation in local environmental governance under the pressure exerted by the media the public can maintain a higher enthusiasm for complete participation for a certain period of time and stop reporting when the overall situation of local environmental governance is improving the eventual manifestation is that the public converges to the incomplete participation strategy at a relatively low rate in conclusion media intervention changes the payoff of various stakeholders thereby filtering out various suboptimal strategy combinations ultimately the fault tolerance rate of the local environmental governance system is greatly reduced and the system s evolutionary and stable strategy combination converges sharply towards the optimal situation media attention can effectively break down the information barriers in local environmental governance and alleviate various governance obstacles caused by information asymmetry thereby comprehensively saving environmental supervision costs and improving supervision efficiency with the help of the media the most reasonable resource allocation state in the society can be further optimized and the efficient and benign operation of the entire local environmental governance system can be realized at a lower cost 5 conclusions and policy recommendations before introducing the media attention factors there were 7 unstable equilibrium points in the benchmark model the remaining 9 were conditionally stable equilibrium points and there was no absolute ess corresponding to the actual situation the ideal degree of each conditional stability point is quite different the comparison shows that ①enterprises that actively controls pollution is a necessary condition for the local environmental governance to meet the standards a qualified local environmental governance system needs to have both enterprises that actively controls pollution and one of the central or local government that actively conducts environmental regulation ②the operation effect of the local environmental governance system brought by the local government with strict regulation strategy and the enterprises with active pollution control strategy is better than that of the central government under strict supervision strategy cooperated with the enterprises that take the initiative to control pollution ③the influence of public participation under traditional participation channels is limited and cannot fundamentally shake the strategic choices of key players the public s environmental reporting through traditional methods is not enough to cause significant impact on the reported party and the reported local governments or enterprises often have the ability to internalize this small amount of adverse effects as the cost of their negative environmental behavior after introducing the media attention factors the original four party interaction has changed there is a sole stable equilibrium point ess in the supplementary model and the environmental behavior and strategy tendencies of the four game parties show a single and stable trend the following conclusions are drawn from the comparative analysis ①media attention reinforces the status of local governments and enterprises as key participants and affects the stability of the equilibrium points mainly by affecting the environmental behaviors of these two parties but has no effect on the strategic choices of the central government ②negative exposure in the media will strengthen the propensity of key players to choose positive environmental strategies and show a substitution effect on public surveillance ③the impact of media attention greatly compresses the speculation space for all parties to adopt negative environmental strategies and greatly inhibits the spread of negative externalities in the local environmental governance system ④the participation of the media disguised the public into its scattered elements in the process of environmental supervision the public acted as the organization and blood of the mainstream media to a certain extent using public opinion to force the government and enterprises to take appropriate remedial measures to improve environmental conditions thereby significantly improving the efficiency of public participation in local environmental governance the following policy suggestions are put forward for the improvement and perfection of local environmental governance 1 optimize incentive policies fully encourage the media to intervene in environmental issues guide the media to pay more attention to the environmental behaviors of local governments and pollutant discharging enterprises giving play to the media s role in monitoring the environmental behavior of key players 2 pay attention to the reverse supervision on the media strengthen the improvement and monitoring on the background review mechanism of the media exposure platform and ensure the authenticity and objectivity of its negative exposure it is necessary to guide the media to enter the environmental protection camp rather than the profit camp preventing the media from being manipulated by capital and then reduced to a fig leaf for capital seeking profits by covering up the facts of environmental degradation 3 focus on promoting the integration and interaction of self media and mainstream media and cultivate the public to actively become discoverers of environmental problems and feedbackers of local environmental governance performance local official media should take the initiative to capture the public s concerns about real environmental issues under the cover of self media and face the environmental issues discovered through online interactive publicity finally it should be pointed out that this study has some limitations which need to be supplemented and improved in the follow up research the deficiency of this study is that the discussion on the influence mechanism of media attention on local government environmental governance is standing on the shoulders of predecessors based on a series of theoretical ideas based on past experience and achievements in relevant fields combined with the reality of local government environmental governance the research conclusions are limited to the level of theoretical analysis but lack of on the spot investigation and practical data support finally it should be pointed out that this study is an exploratory study affected by my knowledge structure and ability the conclusions and policy recommendations may have some limitations more accurate and specific conclusions and suggestions need more follow up research and supplement in the future as well as the support of theories in other fields related to environmental governance the author is pleased to see the criticism

24241,as an important external supervision force the impact of the media on the process and effect of local environmental governance is gradually deepening and expanding this study constructs a four party evolutionary game model of local environmental governance with the central government local government pollutant discharging enterprises and the public as the game parties on this basis media attention factors are introduced and its impact on local environmental governance is verified through comparative analysis our aim is to build a more clear and comprehensive research framework of local environmental governance to analyze the impact of media attention on local government environmental governance behavior and results and to explore the mechanism of its impact and then considering the media s attention to local government environmental governance put forward the idea of optimizing the local environmental governance in china the research found that 1 media attention reinforces the status of local governments and enterprises as key participants and affects the stability of the equilibrium points mainly by affecting the environmental behaviors of these two parties but has no effect on the strategic choices of the central government 2 negative exposure in the media will strengthen the propensity of key players to choose positive environmental strategies and show a substitution effect on public surveillance 3 media attention can effectively prevent and moderate negative externalities in local environmental governance 4 the participation of the media disguised the public into its scattered elements in the process of environmental supervision the public acted as the organization and blood of the mainstream media to a certain extent using public opinion to force the government and enterprises to take appropriate remedial measures to improve environmental conditions thereby significantly improving the efficiency of public participation in local environmental governance this study enriches the research on the role of the media in the local environmental governance and provides new environmental governance ideas under the attention of the media which is helpful for the exploration of improving the efficiency of local environmental governance keywords media attention local environmental governance four party evolutionary game numerical simulation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction after the reform and opening up china s rapid economic progress is accompanied by a huge energy overdraft and serious environmental pollution environmental problems have become a major resistance to social development yang et al 2022a yang 2022b li et al 2019 local environmental governance directly determines whether china s environmental pollution problems can be properly solved or not which in turn affects whether china s ecological civilization construction can be effectively implemented china continues to increase its investment in environmental control in 2020 the total investment in environmental pollution control in china was 1 06389 trillion yuan with the exception of tibet qinghai hainan and ningxia the total investment in environmental pollution control in the other 27 provinces and cities all exceeded 10 billion yuan the state pays more and more attention to the construction of environmental protection however under the situation of overall improvement and partial deterioration of the environment dealing with the environmental reports and environmental group incidents become a challenging task for the government in social governance zhang 2020 public data in early 2022 show that in 2020 relying on the national eco environmental complaint management platform a total of 231297 telephone reports 204483 wechat reports and 33327 online reports were collected china s environmental governance is the result of the joint participation of multiple parties in addition to the traditional participants such as the central government local governments enterprises and the public the media as the important external force is gradually deepening and expanding their impact on the local environmental governance as of june 2022 china s internet penetration rate reached 74 4 cnnic 2022 under the positive promotion of media exposure a large number of environmental problems and lack of governance responsibilities have been presented to the public for example the private cofferdam incident in dongting lake exposed by xinhua in june 2018 and the tengger desert pollution incident exposed by the beijing news in september 2014 and so on as an important subsystem of social governance structure media has grown into a necessary tool for innovative social governance the research on the influence mechanism of media on local government environmental governance can comply with the new requirements of local government environmental governance extend the decision mechanism of social governance and provide theoretical basis and practical guidance for promoting the coordinated development of economy and environment at present china implements a goal oriented environmental policy and adopts top down stress governance goron and bolsover 2020 in terms of the government under the background of chinese style decentralization there is an obvious principal agent relationship of environmental governance between the central government and the local government wang 2021 wang et al 2021 as for enterprises environmental protection objectives are delegated from the central level and polluting enterprises become the end of the environmental governance system the specific implementers of environmental protection policies and the key regulatory objects of local environmental governance in the aspect of public participation researchers have long reached a consensus on the importance of encouraging participatory governance and fully releasing the power of public participation to environmental governance chu et al 2022 yao et al 2020 although there are shortcomings in professionalism and accuracy as a decentralized independent not easy to game and political manipulation of the accountability system public supervision s positive effect on environmental governance has still been recognized by the academic community munro 2021 wang 2013 as one of the important subjects of environmental governance the media also has the right to choose whether to conduct environmental supervision which depends on the environmental supervision level of the local government and the media s measurement of its own costs and benefits mazzarino et al 2020 it is in the balance of this dual nature that the media influences local environmental governance first the media has wide coverage strong penetration and great influence which affects the level of investment in environmental governance and the adjustment of environmental regulation pan and wei 2019 s secondly the media helps to construct the national ecological environment public opinion construct the discourse system induce and shape the audience s environmental cognition which also reflects the subjectivity of the media in the construction of the public opinion field chen and zhao 2022 finally the media plays a role in supervising enterprises and media reports magnify corporate social responsibility to promote prudent production which can positively promote environmental research and development su et al 2022 game theory can more reasonably describe all kinds of game interaction in the real world so it is widely used in economics biology sociology and other fields for example nikoleta et al constructed a two party evolutionary game model to study the devaluation of rhino horn nikoleta et al 2018 han et al studied derivation of species interactions strength in a plant community by using evolutionary game theory han et al 2019 chen and bao studied the strategic game between predator and prey chen and bao 2022 game theory has advantages over other artificial intelligence methods in computational complexity the idea of using game theory to study environmental problems has been accepted and recognized by academic circles olatinwo and joubert 2022 among them the evolutionary game theory is adopted by more and more researchers because its premise is closer to the reality of environmental governance which is mainly used to explore the optimal interaction model among the participants in the environmental governance system the application of evolutionary game method in the field of environmental governance started from the initial two party game and it is still one of the mainstream choices to use game method to analyze environmental problems for example wu et al applied evolutionary game theory to construct a government enterprise evolutionary game model of low carbon strategy in complex networks research shows that enterprises expectations of government incentives including subsidies and regulation determine the speed at which low carbon strategies can be promoted and spread wu et al 2017 luo et al constructed an evolutionary game model of corporate environmental governance cooperation behavior by using evolutionary games in complex networks the conclusion is that under the self organizing evolution of environmental governance of enterprise groups the cooperation level of environmental governance will eventually reach a lower level luo et al 2020 at present the vast majority of researchers in this research field generally use an advanced version of the tripartite evolutionary game method to analyze more complex environmental behavior interactions for example singh and mukherjee studied the roles of project execution related to environmental impact in organizations and enterprises portfolio manager project manager and environmental manager established a tripartite evolutionary game model and deduced the punishment reward system of environmental protection project execution singh and mukherjee 2022 aghmashhadi et al constructed a tripartite game model of industrial land development conflict which is composed of the ministry of environment industrial and mining organizations and planning and budget organizations according to the study it is necessary to reform the decision making system itself in order to make participants take environmental factors into account in the decision making preference of land development aghmashhadi et al 2022 xu et al discussed the influence of evolutionary stability strategy on the development of electric shipbuilding industry by using tripartite evolutionary game model and considered that under the condition of random initial probability the optimal strategy combination is that both upstream and downstream governments take the initiative to regulate and shipping enterprises in neighboring provinces use clean energy xu et al 2021 yu et al constructed a tripartite evolutionary game model based on stakeholder theory and found that when local governments adopt control strategies for new media new media seek truth from facts and local people adopt non boycott strategies local government intervention in rumors will help to promote new media to publicize the facts of nimby facility pollution and restrict local people s choice of boycott strategies yu et al 2021 in recent years in the field of environmental governance a small number of researchers have gradually tried to use the four party evolutionary game method to carry out the research on environmental problems and realized the further progress of the application research of the game method yang et al established a four party evolutionary game model of energy reporting and regulation which includes the central energy regulatory agencies local energy regulatory agencies energy companies and whistleblowers the results show that public supervision and whistleblowers help to reduce the opportunity cost of inspection by central energy regulators and public active whistleblowers can effectively stimulate the active supervision of local regulators and compliance emissions of energy companies yang et al 2022c yang constructs a four party evolutionary game model of cross regional environmental governance between the two neighboring places the central government and the public it is found that the central policy guidance and the pollution discharge behavior of the adjacent areas lead to the public whistling to protect their rights and the high degree of public participation promotes the level of environmental governance in the adjacent areas yang et al 2022d pan et al constructed a four party evolutionary game model of environmental governance of the central government local government enterprises and the public and used numerical simulation to simulate the influence of parameter changes on the stability strategies of different players in the game system pan et al 2022 it is worth mentioning that among the few four party game studies the research of yang et al 2022a and pan et al 2022 has some similarities with this study mainly in that we are to use the four party evolutionary game model focusing on the top down supervision mechanism and bottom up reporting mechanism to analyze the environmental behavior interaction between the central and local governments or departments the public and enterprises and other environmental governance subjects the numerical simulation analysis method is used to verify and dig deep into the model the differences between this study and previous studies are as follows 1 on the basis of general quadripartite interaction analysis this study tries to design media attention as an external pressure a comparative analysis is made on the basis of the construction of two four party evolutionary game models with and without media attention b previous studies have focused on the analysis of influencing factors studying the impact of the changes of multiple parameters on the strategy of participants and the stability of the system the purpose of this study is to analyze the influence mechanism of media attention on the behavior strategies of local environmental governance participants in addition the research of pan et al 2019 is highly consistent with the theme of this study trying to explore the relationship between media attention and environmental governance the difference is that they use econometric analysis to study the impact of media attention on local environmental governance investment while this study uses game analysis to explore the influence mechanism of media attention on the environmental behavior strategies of local environmental governance subjects reviewing the literature we find that in the existing research few researchers put the forces of government enterprise public media and other environmental governance into the same game analysis framework for comprehensive game analysis and there are few research results on the relationship between media attention and local environmental governance and pay little attention to the role of media as an external supervision force evolutionary game theory is more suitable to the local government environmental governance problem studied in this paper and it is an ideal research tool this study uses the four party game model to carry out theoretical analysis which is the application of the latest stage results of game analysis the purpose of this study is to introduce the external influence of media attention into the general local government environmental governance system in order to explore the role and mechanism of media attention on local government environmental governance and then consider how to coordinate various stakeholders under the attention of the media reasonable adjustment of governance strategies in order to better deal with environmental problems and improve the efficiency of local environmental governance on the basis of previous research we expect to make some contributions from the following two aspects 1 several most representative participants in local environmental governance are selected as the research object and the forces of government enterprise public and media in environmental governance are put into the same framework for comprehensive game analysis a four party evolutionary game model of local environmental governance is constructed 2 we introduce the external impact of media attention and make a theoretical model analysis on the effect and influence mechanism of media on local environmental governance which not only enriches the theoretical basis of related research but also provides ideas for specific environmental governance practice the rest of this article is arranged as follows the second and third sections are methods the second section constructs the four party evolutionary game model of local environmental governance and analyzes the evolutionary stability strategy the third section adds media attention factors to carry out model reconstruction and evolutionary stability strategy analysis the fourth section is the simulation analysis and the result discussion respectively carries on the numerical simulation to the benchmark model and the supplementary model evolution process and launches the comparative analysis and discussion the fifth section summarizes the main conclusions of this paper puts forward the corresponding optimization ideas and reflects on the shortcomings of this study 2 benchmark model construction and stability analysis the main participants in china s local environmental governance system include the central government local governments pollution discharging enterprises and the public by depicting the interaction of environmental behavior among these four parties the basic situation of local environmental governance can be presented 2 1 basic model assumptions according to evolutionary game theory the following three basic preconditions must be satisfied for the four party evolutionary game model to be constructed p1 all players the central government local governments enterprises and the public are bounded rationality the central government s goal is to maximize social welfare the local government s goal is to maximize local political and economic benefits the enterprise s goal is to maximize its own economic profits and the public s goal is to maximize its own rights and interests all parties choose environmental behavior strategies from the perspective of maximizing their own utility and the games are played at the same time in no particular order p2 there are two strategies for each of the four game parties to choose from central government strict supervision loose supervision local government strict regulation lax regulation pollution discharging enterprises active pollution control passive pollution control the public complete participation incomplete participation p3 the probability of the central government choosing a strict supervision strategy is x 0 x 1 and the probability of loose supervision is 1 x the probability that the local government chooses a strict regulation strategy is y 0 y 1 and the probability of not strict regulation is 1 y the probability of active pollution control strategy of enterprises is z 0 z 1 then the probability of passive pollution control is 1 z the probability of the public s complete participation in the strategy of environmental governance is w 0 w 1 and the probability of incomplete participation is 1 w combined with the actual situation of local environmental governance in china we describe the benchmark model in detail and propose model assumptions h1 when the central government adopts a strict supervision strategy it means that the central government will strictly urge local governments to implement environmental regulations when adopting the relaxed supervision strategy the representative localities are given a considerable degree of discretion and the local governments make their own decisions according to the requirements of environmental policies and the actual situation the central government determines whether to impose punishment f administrative accountability or political punishment on each local government according to the results of local performance appraisal while the measurement of local environmental performance depends on the local government s environmental regulation strength and the cooperation of enterprises within its jurisdiction the strength λ 1 of central government oversight will affect the central government s supervision cost c 1 α and β are the influence coefficients of the local environmental quality level and economic development level on the national overall level respectively h2 when the local government adopts the strategy of strict regulation it will strictly control the environmental protection tasks regardless of the cost c 2 of environmental regulation implementation so there is an opportunity cost c 0 for the local government to focus on economic development along with the improvement of environmental conditions e while the local government obtains the benefits b including environmental performance bonus points and public satisfaction improvement it also brings indirect benefits ω l of social governance to the public moreover the local government will reward the enterprise b or impose a fine f far exceeding the enterprise s illegal income according to the pollution control performance of the enterprise the lax regulation strategy adopted by the local government means that the environmental regulation is not fully implemented the local government may be under pressure from local financial pressure the realization of local economic development goals local government competition and comprehensive political performance and then relax regulations and provide insufficient incentives for environment friendly enterprises and privately lower the penalty standards for bad enterprises resulting in environmental losses l public rights loss φ l in addition the negative environmental behaviors of local governments are more likely to be investigated and punished under the strict supervision of the central government 0 v u 1 the local government s enforcement strength λ 2 will affect its regulation cost and the level of rewards and punishments for enterprises h3 when a pollutant discharging enterprise chooses the active pollution control strategy it means that the enterprise takes clean production as the basic production requirement conducts environmental monitoring on its own voluntarily conducts energy conservation and emission reduction actively explores green production technologies and minimizes the negative external effects of production this move brings environmental performance bonus p to the local government and also partially offsets the negative externality losses caused by productive pollution to the public set ω e as the offset amount and set r as the legal production benefit of the enterprise when the passive pollution control strategy is chosen it means that the enterprise ignores its social responsibility for environmental protection and puts its own economic interests first the local government will bear the environmental performance loss q and the public will also suffer the corresponding negative externality loss φ e the level of effort λ 3 of enterprises to reduce emissions affects the enterprises conscious pollution control investment c 3 and the amount of public losses enterprises decide their own production models according to the strictness of local government regulations the condition for enterprises to passively control pollution is that their illegal income is enough to compensate the cost of their pollution control r e c 3 only when the enterprise is reported will it improve the production method and pay the passive rectification cost δ c 3 including the cost of new pollution control before being investigated and the cost of technical improvement after the investigation δ c 3 c 3 passive pollution control enterprises have a higher probability of being investigated and punished when the local government is strictly regulated 0 q p 1 strictly regulated local governments will impose penalties on enterprises that are greater than the illegal profits of enterprises f r e h4 the complete participation strategy adopted by the public means that the public is generally highly concerned about environmental issues a considerable proportion of members in the group spontaneously supervise the environmental performance of local governments and pollutant discharging enterprises and have an impact on the effect of environmental governance when problems are discovered they will consciously report and give feedback put pressure on relevant parties and express their expectations for rectification the public s incomplete participation strategy means that the public generally has low sensitivity and attention to environmental issues lacks the motivation to supervise and takes a wait and see attitude towards the local government s environmental governance the public s level of attention to the local government s environmental governance λ 4 reflects the public s willingness to participate in environmental governance and affects the public s supervision and reporting costs c 4 such as time spent physical effort and material and spiritual burdens the public s successful reporting about the relevant local departments will cause additional losses δ c 2 to the local government including the cost of organizational rectification and the decline of the government s credibility while the public indirectly recovers the incomplete social governance benefits with a proportion of h if the public successfully reports an enterprise the enterprise will suffer additional penalties δ f and reputation loss n from the local government while the public will receive incomplete environmental benefits and local government incentives h l considering that government enterprise collusion will greatly reduce the success rate of the public in reporting enterprises it is assumed that when there is no government enterprise collusion and the information reported by the public is verified the report is deemed successful 2 2 benchmark model construction according to the above model assumptions the payoff matrix of the four player game model of local environmental governance without media attention can be obtained as shown in table 1 2 3 model derivation and equilibrium point stability analysis suppose the fitness of the central government to choose the strict supervision strategy is f a 1 the fitness of the loose supervision strategy is f a 2 and f a is the average fitness then 1 f a 1 y z w π 1 1 y z 1 w π 2 1 y 1 z w π 3 1

1 z 1 w π 16 1 3 f a x f a 1 1 x f a 2 according to the malthusian equation the quantitative growth rate of the central government s choice of strict supervision strategy is equal to the difference between its fitness and the average fitness substituting into the corresponding expression of payment value can obtain the replication dynamic equation of the central government s strict supervision strategy 4 x x f a 1 f a x 1 x 1 y u v λ 1 f λ 1 1 c 1 similarly the replication dynamic equations of the other three parties can be obtained separately and the four dimensional dynamic system i of local environmental governance without media attention can be obtained simultaneously as follows let x 0 y 0 z 0 w 0 solve the system i to get 16 pure strategy equilibrium points 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1

l h ω e λ 4 1 c 4 6 j x x x y x z x w y x y y y z y w z x z y z z z w w x w y w z w w substitute the 16 pure strategy equilibrium points into eq 6 respectively to obtain the eigenvalues corresponding to each pure strategy equilibrium point of the four dimensional dynamic system according to the first method of lyapunov when all eigenvalues of matrix j have negative real parts it can be determined that system i is asymptotically stable at this point and the corresponding strategy combination is the evolutionary stable strategy of system i after analyzing one by one it can be determined that there are 9 stable points in the 16 equilibrium points the results are shown in table 2 ⅰ stability analysis of equilibrium point e 1 at point e 1 0 0 0 0 the equilibrium is asymptotically stable if the following four conditions hold λ 1 1 c 1 u v f 0 λ 2 1 c 2 c 0 p q λ 2 f v f l b e 0 λ 3 1 c 3 r e λ 2 b q λ 2 f δ c 3 0 λ 4 1 c 4 h ω l ξ λ 2 h l h ω e 0 in this case all parties have adopted negative environmental behavior strategies in the light of their relative benefits local governments are powerless to regulate while the central government relaxes its supervision over local governments allowing enterprises to unrestrictedly discharge pollutants and the public is forced to accept the negative externalities of environmental degradation this corresponds to the phenomenon of government failure and market failure in reality and the entire local environmental governance dynamic system remains inefficient this point is not an ideal stable equilibrium point ⅰi stability

out environmental reporting the public s complete participation in environmental governance can bring relative benefits to itself but it has not shaken the strategic choices of other parties in the absence of the government and enterprises action there is little possibility of relying solely on public environmental whistleblowers to improve the environmental status quo this point is a less ideal

compensate for a series of costs of enterprises under the passive pollution control strategy this leads to a positive relative income of enterprises under the active pollution control strategy and active pollution control has become the best choice for enterprises given the good performance of enterprises local governments give them appropriate incentives and tend to relax environmental regulations while the public is more inclined to incomplete participation due to the negative relative returns under the opposite strategy nonetheless the benefits of the local government s lax regulation strategy and the public s incomplete participation strategy are both negative namely λ 2 c 2 c 0 b v f λ 2 l 0 λ 4 c 4 0 so both parties have made a strategic choice of choosing the best of the bad although enterprises can still take the initiative to control pollution even when the central and local governments have fully relaxed supervision in the long term evolution it is unrealistic to expect pollutant discharging enterprises to maintain positive environmental behaviors in the absence of sufficient government constraints this point is a less ideal stable equilibrium point ⅰv

complete participation strategy is chosen but the strategy choice of the local government to conduct lax regulation and the enterprises to actively control pollution has not been shaken in this case when the government relaxes supervision enterprises can still take the initiative to control pollution and the public is also willing to advise the local government however in reality pollutant discharging enterprises are oriented by economic interests and have moral hazard while the public is easily constrained by government enterprise conspiracy and has limited power therefore it is difficult to maintain the harmonious situation of the government s governing by inaction for a long time only by relying on the environmental protection consciousness of enterprises and the enthusiasm of the public for supervision this point is a less ideal stable equilibrium point v stability analysis of equilibrium point e 7 at point e 7 0 1 1 0 the equilibrium is asymptotically stable if the following four conditions hold λ 1 1 c 1 0 1 λ 2 c 2 c 0 b v f l b e 0 1 λ 3 c 3 r e b p f δ c 3 0 λ 4 1 c 4 0 with their own trade offs the central and local governments are more inclined to a loose supervision strategy and a strict regulation strategy which brings positive relative returns at this time there is a high probability that the illegal discharge behavior of enterprises will be investigated and punished and the losses will far exceed the illegal income of them active pollution control is the best choice for enterprises given that both local governments and polluters have chosen active environmental strategies to work together to minimize environmental losses the public is highly satisfied with local governments environmental governance performance considering that participation in environmental governance will not bring benefits to the public and under the same benefits the public can obtain less cost and more relative benefits by adopting an incomplete participation strategy so the public tends to incomplete participation this situation depicts the optimal operating state of the local environmental governance system that is there is no need for the central government to strengthen supervision local governments still strictly implement environmental regulations enterprises consciously take the initiative to control pollution as well as the public has a sense of security in the protection of their own environmental rights and interests without additional environmental supervision costs which is the optimal allocation of social resources vi

three parties adopt a negative strategy under such circumstances the central government will continue to increase investment in supervision in order to stimulate local governments to implement environmental regulations improve the environmental protection social responsibility and consciousness of enterprises and restore public trust at this time the operation effect of the local environmental governance system is not good this point is not an ideal stable equilibrium point vii stability analysis of equilibrium point e 10 at point e 10 1 0 0 1 the equilibrium is asymptotically

compared with the previous situation while the strict supervision of the central government continues to increase the cost of supervision the public can bring relative benefits to themselves under the complete participation strategy so they participate in environmental governance completely however this does not shake the inherent negative strategic choices of local governments and enterprises and the complete participation of the public has very limited effect on turning the situation around the operation effect of the local environmental governance system is still not ideal which is a less ideal stable equilibrium point viii stability analysis of equilibrium point e 11 at point e 11 1 0 1 0 the equilibrium is asymptotically stable if the following four conditions hold 1 λ 1 c 1 u v f 0

strategy and the profit oriented pollutant discharging enterprises will steadily adopt the active pollution control strategy as the front end practitioners of local environmental governance the positive environmental behaviors of enterprises play a decisive role in the improvement of environmental quality which constitutes one of the important reasons for the relaxation of local government regulations at this time the central government may increase the incentives to urge local governments to increase their enthusiasm for implementing environmental regulations and the public does not have enough motivation to report when their environmental rights and interests are basically guaranteed and the losses of environmental damage are basically minimized this point is a relatively ideal

relative returns at this time however although public whistleblowing increases the possibility of local governments suffering losses to a certain extent local governments will still relax regulation based on the good performance of enterprises and the relative interests of local governments themselves in this case in the absence of strict regulations by local governments enterprises can still take the initiative to control pollution and the public is also willing to urge local governments to strengthen environmental regulations from the perspective of long term evolution local governments may be forced to reverse the negative strategy due to top down pressure from the central government and bottom up negative feedback from the public this point is a relatively ideal stable equilibrium point 3 model reconstruction and stability analysis 3 1 supplementary model assumptions the media infiltrates the entire local environmental governance system as a supervisor and media attention will dramatically expand the negative impact of environmental issues setting media interventions are reflected in media influencing and changing the environmental behavior of other participants and then introduce media factors to reconstruct the benchmark model and make supplementary assumptions h5 assume that the media s reflection of environmental facts is objective individuals tend to react more strongly to negative information than to positive information so that the media is more willing to report and criticize negative events out of consideration for economic benefits media attention will bring high exposure r u r 1 p r 1 for negative environmental behaviors h6 after local environmental issues are exposed by the media the central government will increase the cost m 1 of dispatching inspectors focusing on under performing local governments h7 after the ineffective environmental regulation of local governments was exposed local governments are forced to bear internal rectification costs including organizational improvement costs and government public relations costs and a large number of external costs including substantial loss of credibility loss of government image and possible associated local economic and employment losses etc set k as the local governments internal and external media pressure cost h8 after the enterprises bad environmental behaviors are exposed the local government will increase the cost m 2 of environmental regulation and enterprises under investigation will pay a huge cost of benefit loss that is far greater than its illegal income t including additional punishment by the local government passive rectification costs loss of corporate reputation and public relations costs h9 various media exposure platforms can remove some of the blind spots of environmental problems for the public and at the same time help them to speak out about the environment which comprehensively lowers the threshold for the public to participate in local environmental governance assume that the overall cost of public participation is reduced to d 0 d c 4 3 2 model reconstruction after adding the above assumptions and adjusting the benchmark model a new payoff matrix of the four parties evolutionary game of local environmental governance can be reconstructed considering the impact of media attention as shown in table 3 3 3 stability analysis of equilibrium points when the media attention factor is included the derivation process of the new model is the same as the evolution derivation path of the benchmark model in the previous section first the four dimensional dynamic system ii of local environmental governance considering the factors of media attention is obtained 7 x x 1 x y 1 λ 1 m 1 λ 1 1 c 1 m 1 y y 1 y 1 z w λ 2 1 ξ h l 1 z λ 2 1 m 2 r f z λ 2 1 b λ 2 1 c 2 c 0 r f e b l k z z 1 z y b r f λ 3 1 c 3 r e λ 2 b r f t w w 1 w y 1 z 1 λ 2 ξ h l 1 y h ω l 1 z ξ λ 2 h l h ω e λ 4 1 d then the jacobian matrix j corresponding to system ii is obtained by calculating the first order partial derivatives of the obtained replicated dynamic equations let x 0 y 0 z 0 w 0 find 16 pure strategy equilibrium points 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 and substitute them into the jacobian matrix j to obtain the eigenvalues corresponding to each pure strategy equilibrium point of system ii finally the first method of lyapunov is used to judge the stability of system ii at each point when all eigenvalues are negative the equilibrium point can be judged to be asymptotically stable and the corresponding strategy combination is the evolutionary stability strategy ess of the system after screening and judgment it can be determined that there is only a unique asymptotically stable equilibrium point e 7 0 1 1 0 in the system ii as shown in table 4 the stability conditions are λ 1 1 c 1 0 1 λ 2 c 2 c 0 b r f e b l k 0 1 λ 3 c 3 r e b r f t 0 λ 4 1 d 0 and the corresponding strategy combination loose supervision strict regulation active pollution control incomplete participation is the only evolutionary stability strategy ess of system ii for the central government the cost of strict supervision is greater than the cost of loose supervision under the same income so it tends to loose supervision because of the positive relative income media exposure increases the probability that local governments and enterprises will be investigated and punished by their superiors for adopting negative environmental protection behaviors and leads to negative relative returns for the two under negative strategies therefore local governments choose to strictly supervise and enterprises choose to actively control pollution although the media attention has greatly improved the public s environmental awareness and provided a cheap and efficient channel for environmental monitoring in reality there are relatively few cases where the public needs to report and the public can obtain positive relative benefits under the incomplete participation strategy in the long run the complete participation strategy will not bring additional benefits to the public group so the public generally tends to be silent in this case the central government does not need to strengthen environmental supervision because under the all round supervision of the media the key players in local environmental governance local governments and pollutant discharging enterprises are magnified the possible losses under their negative environmental behavior strategies local governments choose strict regulations and enterprises consciously take the initiative to control pollution so that the public s environmental rights and interests can be adequately guaranteed to a certain extent 4 numerical simulation and sensitivity analysis based on the actual situation under the premise of ensuring that the specific economic significance is met combined with the assumptions of the model this study refers to the assignment method in the relevant literature to assign the parameters in the model rationally jin et al 2022 chu et al 2019 with the help of matlab r2016b the numerical simulation of system i and ii is carried out respectively so that the impact of media attention on local environmental governance and its mode of action can be visualized 4 1 simulation of evolution path of benchmark model set the initial time as 0 the end time as 30 and the initial probability as 0 5 0 5 0 5 0 5 and draw the two dimensional evolution paths of the environmental behavior strategies of the four players corresponding to the 9 conditionally stable equilibrium points of the benchmark model respectively in order to present the equilibrium strategy tendency of each party under the initial probability as can be seen from the images corresponding to the 9 equilibrium points of system i the strategy tendency curves of each player have different degrees of fluctuation and oscillation in the early stage of evolution specifically under the measure of its relative returns the central government s strategy is to resolutely converge on strict supervision or loose supervision and there is no repetition or fluctuation in various situations however the environmental strategies of local governments and enterprises show significant volatility characteristics especially under non ideal e1 and less than ideal e2 e3 e4 e9 and e10 conditions since there is no media amplification effect on various negative impacts there is still room for speculation among the three parties other than the central government in the process of choosing environmental strategies the quality of local environmental governance depends largely on the environmental strategies of local governments and pollutant discharging enterprises but public participation has limited power to shake up key players decision making so the public s strategy evolution process is relatively stable ① discussion on the optimal state of environmental governance of local government at the stable equilibrium point e 7 0 1 1 0 the participants in local environmental governance have obvious environmental behavior strategy tendency from the early stage of evolution and complete the evolutionary stability of their respective strategy choices in 5 units of time as shown in fig 1 among them pollutant discharging enterprises and local governments stabilize the strategies of active pollution control and strict regulation respectively and the central government tends to loose supervision strategies almost synchronously with the positive environmental governance performance of local governments as the end link and main feedback in the chain of local environmental governance system the public tends to the strategy of incomplete participation at a slower speed it can be seen that system i has realized the arrangement of environmental behavior strategies of the four players in a very short time and the whole local government environmental governance system has reached the most efficient and reasonable environmental governance cooperation situation at e7 ② discussion on the relatively ideal state of local government environmental governance as is shown in fig 2 at the stable equilibrium points e 11 1 0 1 0 and e 12 1 0 1 1 as the actual practitioners of environmental protection tasks the pollutant discharging enterprises tend to take the initiative to control pollution so that the environmental interests of the public are protected to a certain extent and then choose the strategy of incomplete participation however in the absence of bottom up pressure on environmental governance local governments have decisively relaxed their environmental regulations the central government s strict environmental supervision strategy is only to balance the focus of work between local governments environmental governance tasks and other tasks such as economic development at this time the overall performance of local environmental governance is good but the completion and effect of the actual environmental governance depends more on the consciousness of the relevant enterprises and the weak supervision and feedback of the public ③ discussion on the less ideal state of local government environmental governance at the stable equilibrium point e 2 0 0 0 1 as shown in fig 3 the central government does not pay more attention to local environmental governance so local governments and polluters decisively choose negative environmental behavior strategies in this case the public intends to change the weak situation of local environmental governance through high frequency negative environmental feedback at this time the focus of the social governance is not on environmental protection only the public who always have the demand for a healthy living environment are actively trying to reverse the situation but with little success at the stable equilibrium points e 3 0 0 1 0 and e 4 0 0 1 1 as shown in fig 4 in view of the fact that the pollutant discharging enterprises decisively choose to control pollution actively the local government quickly relaxes its environmental regulation after a short period of strict regulation and the public may gradually tend to incomplete participation strategy because of the environmentally friendly performance of enterprises or slowly tend to complete participation strategy because of the inaction of local governments in environmental governance and in order to protect the public s own environmental rights on the whole the common point of the evolution of system i at the equilibrium point e2 e3 and e4 lies in the absolute relaxation of environmental control by the government local environmental protection mainly depends on economic interest oriented enterprises and the public with limited influence and the social efficiency is low and there are potential risks that are not conducive to local environmental governance as shown in fig 5 at the stable equilibrium point e 9 1 0 0 0 the local government almost gives up its function of environmental regulation and allows the pollutant discharging enterprises to engage in production activities under the passive pollution control strategy all the participants in the local environmental governance system except the central government choose the negative environmental strategy at the stable equilibrium point e 10 1 0 0 1 in view of the negative environmental behavior of local governments and pollutant discharging enterprises the public has sufficient reason and motivation to report that is the public participate completely in environmental governance system i in the evolution process of e9 and e10 as the key participants of local environmental governance the local government and pollutant discharging enterprises are completely negative to environmental governance which makes the whole local environmental governance system almost shut down the operation of the system mainly depends on the increasing investment of environmental supervision from the central government which is not enough to mobilize the enthusiasm of key participants local governments and enterprises in the pollution control industry ④ discussion on the unsatisfactory state of local government environmental governance at the stable equilibrium point e 1 0 0 0 0 whether the government enterprises or the public the choice of environmental behavior strategies fluctuated sharply in the first 20 units of time but tended to be stable after 20 units of time as is shown in fig 6 this means that in the early stage of evolution the environmental behavior strategy of the four players is wavering and the choice of environmental behavior strategy is gradually determined after a relatively long period of wait and see and trade off it can be found that the two key participants tend to choose positive environmental strategies from the very beginning that is local governments strictly carry out environmental regulation and pollutant discharging enterprises take the initiative to control pollution in view of this the central government gradually relaxes environmental supervision and the enthusiasm of public participation in reporting is not enough to be fully mobilized however with the passage of time in view of the relaxation of supervision by the central government the local government gradually took the lead in reducing the strictness of its environmental regulation which led to the tendency of pollutant discharging enterprises to shift from active pollution control to passive pollution control at this time the local government turned to improve the rigor of its environmental regulation in order to maintain its own environmental governance performance and the enterprises turned to the active pollution control strategy a situation of catching up with each other with inconsistent frequency has been formed between local governments and enterprises in this process the tendency of public participation in environmental governance has rebounded from a low degree of participation to a certain extent but it is unable to change the situation of speculative competition between local governments and enterprises finally with the negative strategy tendency of the two gradually same frequency it fell back to the incomplete participation strategy however due to the location limitations and relative information disadvantages of the central government the game competition of other participants in the early stage is not enough for the central government to adjust its environmental supervision strategy on the whole at the equilibrium point e1 the interaction of environmental behavior among the participants of local environmental governance fell into a vicious circle and finally the four participants chose negative environmental behavior strategies one after another the whole system fell into the state of market failure and government failure 4 2 sensitivity analysis under the same initial probability time and step size we draw the evolution paths of the most ideal point e7 of system i and the unique stable point e7 of system ii respectively and conduct a sensitivity analysis of media attention factors through comparative simulation the simulation results are shown in fig 7 when the media attention is added to the local government environmental governance system there is only one of the nine stable equilibrium points of the original system i in the system ii and the only one corresponds to the most ideal stable equilibrium point in the system i thus it can be seen that the media s attention to environmental issues will cause the whole local government environmental governance system to converge sharply to the optimal mode of operation in the natural state comparing the optimal evolution path of system i and system ii it is found that due to the existence of media attention the response time of some participants to adopt their own environmental strategies has changed significantly while the strategy choices of some participants are not significantly affected by media attention specifically ①as key participants local governments and pollutant discharging enterprises will choose positive environmental behavior strategies at a faster speed the possible reason is that due to the media s external supervision of local government environmental governance and the media s gaze on the actual mode of production of pollutant discharge enterprises coupled with the huge network of environmental and social supervision and feedback woven by the media the cost of lax regulation by local governments and passive pollution control by enterprises is not limited to controllable losses forcing them to improve their strategic tendency to environmental behavior ②the involvement of the media in the environmental governance of local governments slows down the speed at which the public chooses incomplete participation strategies the addition of media power expands the participants and paths of environmental governance and with the help of the media it satisfies the increasingly strong desire of the public to participate in environmental decision making environmental supervision and safeguarding environmental rights and interests and the efficiency of the media is geometrically improved in this case although the public generally takes a wait and see attitude towards the environmental governance work of local governments the existence of the media can make the public fully participate in the strategic tendency to hold a considerable stickiness in addition media attention provides the necessary sense of security for public environmental supervision and acts as a powerful tool for the public to participate in local environmental governance showing a substitute effect on the function of public supervision ③the change range of the central government s environmental behavior strategy tendency is not obvious and it is almost not affected by the media attention factors the environmental supervision of the central government is mainly carried out by the local government which is the agent of its environmental governance task and the environmental governance task undertaken by the local government is only one of all tasks therefore in an ideal local government environmental governance model the central government should maintain appropriate attention to local government environmental governance rather than absolutely strict monitoring and inspection thus media pressure only affects the key participants in local government environmental governance local governments and enterprises and other stakeholders the public but has no impact on the decision making of the central government the external supervision of media is mainly reflected in that the costs to be paid by local governments and pollutant discharging enterprises under the negative environmental strategy increase sharply and cannot be easily absorbed by the corresponding subjects thereby breaking the original equilibrium in the corresponding situation which prompting the local government and enterprises to adjust their strategies and tilt towards positive environmental behavior the strategy of the central government mainly depends on the relative relationship between its environmental monitoring costs and overall political benefits and is not affected by media attention moreover in view of the benign situation of local environmental governance the central government has more decisively relaxed the supervision to local environmental governance led by local governments compared with the government and enterprises various media exposure platforms have made the public more powerful than ever the public s concerns about government enterprise collusion and the subsequent hidden dangers of reporting have been dispelled and they have gained confidence in the supervision of environmental issues with its powerful external supervision and high communication efficiency the media has exacerbated the weakening of traditional public reporting channels in the long term evolution on the surface it is an alternative to public environmental supervision but in essence it is an advanced step for public participation in local environmental governance under the pressure exerted by the media the public can maintain a higher enthusiasm for complete participation for a certain period of time and stop reporting when the overall situation of local environmental governance is improving the eventual manifestation is that the public converges to the incomplete participation strategy at a relatively low rate in conclusion media intervention changes the payoff of various stakeholders thereby filtering out various suboptimal strategy combinations ultimately the fault tolerance rate of the local environmental governance system is greatly reduced and the system s evolutionary and stable strategy combination converges sharply towards the optimal situation media attention can effectively break down the information barriers in local environmental governance and alleviate various governance obstacles caused by information asymmetry thereby comprehensively saving environmental supervision costs and improving supervision efficiency with the help of the media the most reasonable resource allocation state in the society can be further optimized and the efficient and benign operation of the entire local environmental governance system can be realized at a lower cost 5 conclusions and policy recommendations before introducing the media attention factors there were 7 unstable equilibrium points in the benchmark model the remaining 9 were conditionally stable equilibrium points and there was no absolute ess corresponding to the actual situation the ideal degree of each conditional stability point is quite different the comparison shows that ①enterprises that actively controls pollution is a necessary condition for the local environmental governance to meet the standards a qualified local environmental governance system needs to have both enterprises that actively controls pollution and one of the central or local government that actively conducts environmental regulation ②the operation effect of the local environmental governance system brought by the local government with strict regulation strategy and the enterprises with active pollution control strategy is better than that of the central government under strict supervision strategy cooperated with the enterprises that take the initiative to control pollution ③the influence of public participation under traditional participation channels is limited and cannot fundamentally shake the strategic choices of key players the public s environmental reporting through traditional methods is not enough to cause significant impact on the reported party and the reported local governments or enterprises often have the ability to internalize this small amount of adverse effects as the cost of their negative environmental behavior after introducing the media attention factors the original four party interaction has changed there is a sole stable equilibrium point ess in the supplementary model and the environmental behavior and strategy tendencies of the four game parties show a single and stable trend the following conclusions are drawn from the comparative analysis ①media attention reinforces the status of local governments and enterprises as key participants and affects the stability of the equilibrium points mainly by affecting the environmental behaviors of these two parties but has no effect on the strategic choices of the central government ②negative exposure in the media will strengthen the propensity of key players to choose positive environmental strategies and show a substitution effect on public surveillance ③the impact of media attention greatly compresses the speculation space for all parties to adopt negative environmental strategies and greatly inhibits the spread of negative externalities in the local environmental governance system ④the participation of the media disguised the public into its scattered elements in the process of environmental supervision the public acted as the organization and blood of the mainstream media to a certain extent using public opinion to force the government and enterprises to take appropriate remedial measures to improve environmental conditions thereby significantly improving the efficiency of public participation in local environmental governance the following policy suggestions are put forward for the improvement and perfection of local environmental governance 1 optimize incentive policies fully encourage the media to intervene in environmental issues guide the media to pay more attention to the environmental behaviors of local governments and pollutant discharging enterprises giving play to the media s role in monitoring the environmental behavior of key players 2 pay attention to the reverse supervision on the media strengthen the improvement and monitoring on the background review mechanism of the media exposure platform and ensure the authenticity and objectivity of its negative exposure it is necessary to guide the media to enter the environmental protection camp rather than the profit camp preventing the media from being manipulated by capital and then reduced to a fig leaf for capital seeking profits by covering up the facts of environmental degradation 3 focus on promoting the integration and interaction of self media and mainstream media and cultivate the public to actively become discoverers of environmental problems and feedbackers of local environmental governance performance local official media should take the initiative to capture the public s concerns about real environmental issues under the cover of self media and face the environmental issues discovered through online interactive publicity finally it should be pointed out that this study has some limitations which need to be supplemented and improved in the follow up research the deficiency of this study is that the discussion on the influence mechanism of media attention on local government environmental governance is standing on the shoulders of predecessors based on a series of theoretical ideas based on past experience and achievements in relevant fields combined with the reality of local government environmental governance the research conclusions are limited to the level of theoretical analysis but lack of on the spot investigation and practical data support finally it should be pointed out that this study is an exploratory study affected by my knowledge structure and ability the conclusions and policy recommendations may have some limitations more accurate and specific conclusions and suggestions need more follow up research and supplement in the future as well as the support of theories in other fields related to environmental governance the author is pleased to see the criticism

24242,in this article a novel coupled socio environmental model is proposed and analysed using real data the model is formulated with two interconnected subsystems a human environment model that describes the state of forest cover human population and atmospheric carbon dioxide co2 concentration and a socio economic model that represents human behaviour as a dynamical variable human behaviour focuses on their opinion about forest conservation which affects the harvesting rate per unit area we examine the mathematical model analytically and numerically to gain insight into the dynamics of the coupled system by plotting the basin of attractions we show that when an initial abundance of forest cover is small and there is a low fraction of conservationists the system eventually stays at a higher density of forest cover and a higher fraction of conservationists however for intermediate to high values of initial forest cover the system stays at a low forest cover and a low fraction of conservationists among people with an increase in the economic cost after a certain threshold we observe that the number of cooperators increases despite the forest cover being very low further the model is validated using yearly data on forest cover and atmospheric co2 in the period 1990 2016 the fitting to the data is performed using a matlab optimization technique and the quality of the fitting is quantified using accuracy metrics numerical simulations using estimated parameters show that increasing forest cover is essential in reducing the co2 level in the atmosphere from a policy making point of view it is important to increase the proportion of conservationists in the community which will eventually result in increased forest cover and consequently decrease the burden of atmospheric co2 concentration keywords atmospheric co2 logit best response bistability parameter estimation sensitivity data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the climate of the earth changes regularly due to several factors including changes in the earth s orbit changes in the sun s intensity volcanic emissions changes in the ocean currents and changes in greenhouse gas concentrations over the last decades global warming has been an alarming phenomenon concerning the affected population level livelihood and scientific research community the increasing concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide is the main driving force for global warming the elevated level of has reached 418 81 ppm parts per million from its pre industrial level of 280 ppm tans 2012 if it continues like this climate change will become more forbidding in the near future the rate of increase of depends very little on natural causes such as volcanic activity changes in oceanic circulation and melting glaciers the continued growth in atmospheric is not caused directly by human population expansion but by people s activities such as deforestation agricultural transformation wood burning and mainly the increased use of coal petroleum and natural gas for expanding industrialization revelle 1982 newell and marcus 1987 emissions due to such human activities grew at an average rate of 2 6 per year in the period 2000 2014 however this rate was 1 72 per year in 1970 2000 edenhofer 2014 this suggests that human exposure to is higher than previously perceived not only contributes to climate change but also increases human health risks these risks include inflammation kidney calcification reduced higher level cognitive abilities oxidative stress bone demineralization and endothelial dysfunction see jacobson et al 2019 and references cited therein the human population and forests are extremely correlated with the atmospheric concentration of two main driving factors responsible for increasing level are fossil fuel burning and deforestation some individuals are aware of the global situation and behave like conservationists but there are people with the opposite opinion who are doing deforestation here the term conservationist is used to explain only a part of the human population who have not agreed with forest logging rather than those who are aware of the global atmospheric level and adapting behaviour to reduce emissions thus the socio economic choice of people plays an important role in an environmental system we therefore consider the dynamics of the socio economic choice of people together with human environmental dynamics to mitigate the deterioration of our environment few researchers have paid significant attention to studying the environmental coupled socio environmental and socio ecological models in current ecology and environmental science research liu et al 2007 iwasa et al 2010 misra and verma 2013 bauch et al 2016 sun and hilker 2020a iwasa and his coauthors studied the impact of human behaviour on lake water pollution in a series of publications iwasa et al 2007 suzuki and iwasa 2009a b iwasa et al 2010 recently sun and hilker 2020a investigated a socio ecological model considering lake water pollution and human behaviour and showed complex dynamics of the system including multistability and bifurcation in the context of the environmental system misra and verma 2013 studied a mathematical model to explore the impact of atmospheric concentration of on forest biomass and the human population and showed that human populations decline with the increase of anthropogenic emissions bauch et al 2016 studied a coupled human environment model to explore the effect of human behaviour on the dynamics of forest cover they showed rich and complex dynamics of the coupled system and regime shifts compared to the uncoupled system however the dynamics of the human population and atmospheric concentration of were not considered thus we intend to investigate a coupled socio environmental system that considers forest cover the human population atmospheric concentration and the socio economic choice of people to model the socio economic choice of people using a game theoretic approach two different kinds of formulations are familiar logit best response dynamics satake and iwasa 2006 satake et al 2007 sun and hilker 2020a and replicator dynamics tavoni et al 2012 lade et al 2013 bauch et al 2016 mathematical models using the above two formulations may have a different number of equilibria and thus dynamical complexity of the systems differ from each other logit best response dynamics is used to represent the bistability in humans collective choice regarding whether or not to conserve the forest the replicator dynamics model is a limited case of the logit best response model when agents are assumed to behave with infinite rationality however if agents act less rationally then the best response dynamics model is the foremost method to model the socio economic choice of people hopkins 1999 sun and hilker 2020b we therefore consider the logit best response dynamics and refer to the model equation that describes the socio economic choice of people as a socio economic subsystem modelling such a system using logit best response dynamics attributes a new direction to the environmental system hofbauer and sigmund 2003 satake and iwasa 2006 satake et al 2007 our main motivation for this study is to investigate how atmospheric concentration of impacts such coupled socio environmental system we are concerned with the following questions 1 how does the growth rate of atmospheric due to anthropogenic factors impact the growth dynamics of the human population 2 how does the socio environmental system behave when the harvesting rate increases from its standard rate 3 how does the system behave by changing the different values of social factors in general how do the system dynamics changes with the influence of human behaviour the remaining of this article can be organized into three parts in the first part we develop a socio environmental model which is an integrated system of the human environment subsystem and socio economic subsystem then we explore the bistability behaviour among coexistence equilibria next we analyse the impact of social factors on the dynamics of the system and show rich and complex dynamics in the next part we validate our mathematical model using real data and then investigate the sensitivity of important model parameters with respect to the atmospheric concentration of in the last part we discuss our main results and finally provide a brief conclusion 2 model description at this point we formulate our mathematical model which consists of two interconnected subsystems a human environment system and a socio economic system the first part is an environment dynamics model with three state variables forest cover f t human population n t and atmospheric concentration of c t at any time t the second part describes the socio economic system governed by the state variable p t which represents human behaviour as a dynamical variable interacting with environmental dynamics 2 1 human environment subsystem to derive the human environment subsystem model we consider the following assumptions the growth rate of the forest cover at any time t depends only on the quantity of forest present at that time all the other factors affecting the growth rate are constant over time the general shape of the growth function of forest cover is convex with some upper bound the increase of growth function in the low biomass range represents the increase in photosynthetic capacity with increasing leaf area at some stage there is no change and then a decrease in the higher range which represents self interference effects for example shading and competition this type of behaviour of the growth curve is well established both theoretically and experimentally donald 1961 brougham 1955 and the prototypical example is logistic growth the human population clears forests for their needs such as housing paper furniture agriculture logging and several other purposes eckholm 1982 repetto and holmes 1983 garcia montiel and scatena 1994 the consumption function of forest cover by humans is a saturating function that increases at low density of the forest and approaches a threshold value when density is high noy meir 1975 bauch et al 2016 such a function can be characterized by the michaelis function ϕ f h s f where h is the harvesting efficiency and s is the per capita demand for forestry products thus the harvesting rate per unit area is h s f the inverse dependence on f arises because the per unit area demand for forestry products is assumed to increase as the supply f declines the human population also grows logistically further it is assumed that the human population will be decreased due to the death of humans caused by the increase of atmospheric as pointed out in the preceding section poses direct risks to human health such as the incidence of vector borne diseases kidney calcification and bone demineralization jacobson et al 2019 thus we assume that the human population declines with an increase in the concentration of atmospheric the growth rate of atmospheric depends on both anthropogenic and non anthropogenic factors since the anthropogenic emissions depend on human activities therefore we assume that it depends linearly on the human population newell and marcus 1987 onozaki 2009 the growth rate of atmospheric due to non anthropogenic factors like a volcanic eruption melting of glaciers and the respiration process of a living organism is assumed to be a constant π also forests absorb from the atmosphere during the photosynthesis process so the concentration of depletes due to the forest cover the depletion of due to natural sinks other than forests like oceans etc is also considered and it is taken to be proportional to the atmospheric concentration of keeping the above assumptions in mind we consider the following human environment model 2 1 d f d t r f f 1 f k f h f s f d n d t r n n 1 n k n θ c n d c d t π r n α c μ c f the parameters related to the above system are defined in table 1 2 2 socio economic subsystem the socio economic system describes some human behaviour that influences the environment we consider a number of players whose behaviour affects the harvesting rate per unit area of the forest cover players choose between a cooperative but costly option and an economical option their decision is affected by the conservationists present in the community and the importance of forests in the environment suppose that p is the fraction of the human population who do not agree to clear the forest that is forest conservationists whereas 1 p is the fraction of those who clear the forest for their own needs that is non conservationists so it is evident that 0 p 1 thus the part of the total population who are not agreed to clear the forest that is p n are the conservationists cooperators for the socio environmental system therefore when p is small we refer to it as a low level of cooperation among people analogously when p is large we refer to it as a high level of cooperation among people the term cooperation comes from game theory which is not about social interaction but rather about environment friendly behaviour it is to be noted that here we consider p as the fraction of the world s total human population rather than the conservationists in local communities who are close to forests or composed of loggers the choice of each player would be affected by the utility of two options the utility for the conservative option is denoted by g c o n and that of the non conservative option is characterized by g n o n then δ g describes the differences in utility between g c o n and g n o n therefore the differential equation that describes the time evolution of the fraction of conservationists is given by 2 2 d p d t m 1 1 e β δ g p where β represents the rationality of agents and m denotes the speed of human behaviour if β is immense players always take the best option conforming to δ g also when m is small people are more conservative and do not switch their decisions in contrast a large m indicates people are reactive to the change in the total cost for more details about the model formulation see hofbauer and sigmund 2003 satake and iwasa 2006 iwasa et al 2007 2010 suzuki and iwasa 2009b and sun and hilker 2020a now we consider three aspects that describe the differences in utility δ g 1 economic baseline the baseline ν ν 0 is assumed to be negative since it is economically more advantageous for an agent to clear the forest 2 social pressure social pressure or social ostracism is a psychological factor that promotes cooperation it is represented by a linear term in p with parameter ξ accounting for the strength of the agents conformist tendency the more cooperators there are the more people tend to cooperate 3 environmental concern the agents environmental concern is inversely related to the forest cover f with parameter η if the forest cover decreases more people tend to cooperate in reducing the harvesting rate of the forest thus we obtain 2 3 δ g ν economic baseline ξ p social pressure η f environmental concern the above formulation is the same as sun and hilker 2020a except for the environmental concern part this is happening due to lake pollution levels and forest cover are inversely related to the agents concerns this can be explained as when the lake pollution level increases more people tend to cooperate in discharging lower amounts of pollutants sun and hilker 2020a analogously when forest cover decreases more people tend to cooperate in reducing the harvesting rate of the forest also eq 2 3 can be explained as the linearization of the difference in utility as described in suzuki and iwasa 2009b δ g is positive when there are more cooperators than non cooperators and negative for the reverse case as δ g increases the cooperation level also increases with time 2 3 coupled socio environmental system for the uncoupled human environment subsystem 2 1 the harvesting rate per unit area is h s f however in the coupled socio environmental system it becomes h 1 p n s f since in the coupled system only a part of the total population who are non conservationists involves in deforestation also in the uncoupled socio economic system 2 2 the difference in utility δ g depends on f as given in eq 2 3 we combine subsystems 2 1 and 2 2 and the integrated model becomes 2 4 d f d t r f f 1 f k f h f n 1 p s f d n d t r n n 1 n k n θ c n d c d t π r n α c μ c f d p d t m 1 1 e β ν ξ p η f p all the model parameters are positive and defined in table 1 the schematic diagram of the above model is given in fig 1 before proceeding further with the analysis of the coupled socio environmental model 2 4 we non dimensionalize the model to reduce the number of parameters as well as the complexity associated with the analysis now the dimensionless variables are t μ k f t f 1 k f f n 1 k n n c θ μ k f c and p p since the state variable p describes the fraction of conservationists among total human populations it is already a non dimensionalized quantity also the dimensionless parameters are given in table 2 except for the parameters β ν and ξ which remain unaltered dropping the bar for the simplicity of notation the system 2 4 reduces to 2 5 d f d t r f f 1 f h f n 1 p s f d n d t r n n 1 n c n d c d t π r n α c c f d p d t m 1 1 e β ν ξ p η f p this is the mathematical model we analyse in the following the boundedness of solutions of the system 2 5 can be acquired by the next proposition the proof of which is given in the appendix a 1 proposition 2 1 all the solutions of system 2 5 with positive initial conditions are bounded in a given region which is provided by the set ω f n c p 0 f 1 0 n 1 0 c π r α 0 p 1 also we describe the different types of steady state solutions or equilibrium points of the model system 2 5 and their local behaviour by obtaining the eigenvalues of the corresponding jacobian matrix which are given in appendix a 2 3 results in this section we investigate the dynamics of model 2 5 by changing several controllable parameters the initial condition of the model is fixed to 0 8256 0 528 0 0387 0 2843 also the model parameters are taken from table 2 and the remaining parameters from table 1 unless otherwise specified 3 1 bistability between interior equilibria although the occurrence of bistability is a prevalent result in a mathematical model with logit best response it seems to be interesting as it sometimes predicts the counterintuitive result when the parameter values are fixed according to table 2 except r 0 48 and η 0 05 the coupled model 2 5 exhibit three interior equilibria e 1 0 47286 0 10084 0 09809 0 007916 e 2 0 88786 0 171 0 0904 0 76664 and e 3 0 95935 0 181966 0 089243 0 91413 the equilibria corresponding to the highest and lowest values of the fraction of forest conservationists are stable whereas the equilibrium corresponding to the intermediate value of the fraction of conservationists is unstable in this regard the equilibrium to which the system converges would depend on the initial conditions of the coupled system the stability of equilibria is verified using the condition given in a 2 of appendix a 2 we also draw the basin of attraction for the bistability observed in those equilibria with the lowest and highest level of cooperation of people namely e 1 and e 3 respectively first the initial density of the human population and atmospheric is kept fixed n 0 0 528 and c 0 0 03867 and the f 0 p 0 plane is separated into two regions fig 2a the bluish cyan region corresponds to initial conditions where the system asymptotically converges to the highest level of cooperation of people e 3 and the orange region corresponds to initial conditions where the system converges to the lowest level of cooperation of people e 1 when the initial value of both the cooperation level and forest cover is small the system solutions attract towards the equilibrium of the highest cooperation level such an unexpected outcome occurs as the low level of forest cover increases agents environmental concerns as a result more people tend to cooperate and thus higher cooperation level occurs in contrast if the initial abundance of forest cover is larger than a threshold value with a low cooperation level the system solutions converge to the equilibrium of the lowest cooperation level for an intermediate to a high level of forest cover agents environmental concern is not so strong and thus people are less cooperative in the second case we fixed the initial value of forest cover and human population f 0 0 8256 and n 0 0 528 and the c 0 p 0 plane is separated into two regions fig 2b the meaning of coloured region is the same as earlier for an initial cooperation level below a threshold the system converges to the equilibrium of lowest cooperation and above the threshold value converges to the equilibrium of highest cooperation here the initial density of atmospheric has no role in the convergence of the system towards the equilibrium of low or high cooperation since the atmospheric due to anthropogenic factors consider to be large from its basic value and the people are not concerned with the higher atmospheric concentration of 3 2 effect of social factors here we explain a typical case of how the system dynamics change with different values of social factors our main focus is on how the equilibrium density of forest cover atmospheric and the fraction of conservationists changes in response to social factors and explore some unexpected outcomes which are caused by the nonlinearity of the system such type of results may not explore the dynamical behaviour of the system exhaustively however they are essential from a long term management perspective and policy making we are starting with the variations of economic cost or economic baseline ν the forest cover at equilibrium is maximum when the economic cost is minimal and declines to zero when the economic cost becomes large fig 3a however at an intermediate value of ν forest cover suddenly decreases through several bifurcations first the system around the interior equilibrium becomes unstable through a saddle node or limit point bifurcation lp1 and next the system experiences another saddle node bifurcation lp2 mathematically those lp points are the turning points of the equilibrium density curve and at those points one of the eigenvalues of the corresponding jacobian matrix becomes zero fig 4 lastly the system regains its stability through hopf bifurcation the limit cycle generated through hopf bifurcation is unstable as the first lyapunov coefficient is positive thus the system exhibits a subcritical hopf bifurcation further when we increase the strength of ν the system experiences a limit point bifurcation of cycle where two periodic orbits coalesce and annihilate each other see fig 5 we also observe that the atmospheric level increases with the increasing value of economic cost fig 3b this happens due to the declination of forest cover at the same time it is worth noting that all humans are cooperators when the economic cost is zero from fig 3c we observe that initially the number of cooperators is maximum when ν 0 and then decreases with ν however after a threshold value of ν ν 4 9833 the number of cooperators increases as the forest cover level decreases at the same time this type of counterintuitive result is exhibited due to consideration of human behaviour on the dynamics of the coupled system the minimum number of cooperators attain at the second limit point lp2 where ν 4 9833 next we explore the dynamics of the system by changing the agent s conformist tendency ξ that is the more cooperators there are the more people tend to cooperate when the agent s conformism tendency is too small the area of forest cover is also small and increases with enhancing conformism tendency at the same time atmospheric level decreases we observe a similar but opposite type of changes in the equilibrium density of the forest cover atmospheric and the fraction of conservationists with respect to the agent s conformist tendency fig 6 in this case the dynamical behaviour of the model is the same compared to the variation of economic cost ν lastly we look into the dynamics of the system by varying people s environmental concerns η enhancing the strength of η increases the equilibrium level of forest cover and the fraction of conservationists and thus atmospheric level decreases monotonically fig 7 in this case no changes in the stability properties of the equilibrium point thus increasing people s environmental concern is an impactful factor in reducing global atmospheric level 3 3 mixed mode oscillations mixed mode oscillations mmos are defined as complex oscillatory patterns consisting of pairs of small amplitude oscillations alternate with pairs of large amplitude oscillations mmos typically occur in slow fast systems particularly in an ecological system where the lower trophic level exhibits faster dynamics compared to the higher trophic level sadhu and chakraborty thakur 2017 sadhu 2021 there are several distinct perspectives from the dynamical systems and bifurcation theory to explain the mechanism of mmos see brøns et al 2006 2008 kuehn 2011 and desroches et al 2012 and the references therein mmos appeared in many chemical physical and ecological systems petrov et al 1992 koper 1995 sadhu and chakraborty thakur 2017 to the best of our knowledge mmos appearance in socio environmental or socio ecological systems was not yet explored in the present model system 2 5 we observe oscillations with clearly separated amplitudes and thus result in mixed mode oscillations here the economic baseline ν 5 449 environmental concern η 0 01 and other parameter values are the same as in table 2 see fig 8 ecologically an mmo orbit indicates the adaptability of a species to prolong its successive cycles of outbreaks and collapses 3 4 impact of atmospheric due to anthropogenic factors to investigate how the growth rate of atmospheric due to anthropogenic factors r impact the dynamics of the coupled socio environmental model we consider system 2 5 with the parameter values from table 2 with the same initial condition 0 8256 0 528 0 0387 0 2843 we observe that the system is stable around the interior equilibrium point 0 8257 0 6037 0 0432 0 9044 now for increasing the value of r the human population decreases and becomes extinct from the system when r is enormous and forest cover ultimately converges to its carrying capacity fig 9 this is happening because the atmospheric level increases with an increase in the value of r which leads to more deterioration of human health and eventually reduces the human population also the decline in human population leads to a low harvesting rate and thus forest cover increases therefore increasing level due to human activities is detrimental to the human population whether it is beneficial for forest cover 3 5 impact of harvesting efficiency furthermore we study the impact of harvesting efficiency h on the dynamics of the coupled socio environmental model increasing the harvesting efficiency impacts forest cover directly and reduces forest cover to a zero level fig 10 although it has a positive impact on atmospheric and consequently human population decreases thus deforestation has a negative impact on biodiversity global warming carbon cycling and other ecosystem functions matson et al 1997 cuarón 2000 lewis et al 2004 lawrence and vandecar 2015 also since the forest cover decline with h more people tend to cooperate and thus the number of cooperators increases 4 model validation using real data we use yearly time series data on forest cover and concentration of the world to validate our proposed model 2 4 the forest cover data for the period 1990 to 2016 was collected from the worldbank website 1 1 https data worldbank org indicator ag lnd frst k2 the concentration data for the same period 1990 to 2016 was collected from the ourworldindata website 2 2 https ourworldindata org co2 and other greenhouse gas emissions the human population on the year 1990 is taken from the worldbank website 3 3 https data worldbank org indicator sp pop totl the solution curve of forest cover f t and concentration c t are fitted to data using the built in matlab r2018a simplex algorithm to minimize the sum of squares difference between simulated indicators and data we used the matlab function fminsearchbnd to perform the optimization during computation 100 different starting points in parameter space are chosen using latin hypercube sampling to ensure consistency and uniqueness of the parameter estimates the fitting is displayed in fig 11a for forest cover and in fig 11b for concentration the fixed parameters are taken from table 1 the initial conditions are taken as f 0 412 8 n 0 528 c 0 354 39 which come from actual data in the year 1990 see the urls in the footnote and the initial fraction of conservationists is estimated from data we also estimated six parameters viz h θ μ r f m and η the estimated parameters are found to be h 0 0024 θ 0 00012 μ 0 0022 r f 0 0093 m 0 5088 η 22 3269 and p 0 0 2843 to check the accuracy of model fitting we calculate the mean absolute error mae and root mean squared error rmse the accuracy measures for forest cover are found to be mae 1 1649 and rmse 1 3338 for the concentration data mae 3 6128 and rmse 4 2756 this indicates that the model fitting to both time series data is quite good 5 global sensitivity analysis in this section we investigate the sensitivity of important model parameters with respect to the concentration of in the atmosphere we use a variance based method to find the global sensitivity indices of the important input parameters we use sobol s method sobol 1990 to find sensitivity indices of the parameters θ μ η m h r f k f and k n with respect to the mean of concentration in the atmosphere the response is chosen as a mean of atmospheric concentration over 100 years here the response variable is a measure of risk for the concentration of in the atmosphere this global sensitivity technique is based on the decomposition of the variance of response variables onto the summation of variances of the model parameters in increasing dimensionality sobol 1990 cariboni et al 2007 nossent et al 2011 uniform distributions of the input parameters are used to draw 500 samples from their respective ranges the parameter values are taken from table 1 and the other parameters are the estimated values the total order sobol sensitivity indices of the model parameters are depicted in fig 12 the parameters θ μ and k n are found highly sensitive with respect to the concentration of see fig 12 these results give a clear indication that the concentration of c t varies the most with variation in the nonlinear interaction coefficients θ and μ and the carrying capacity of humans however to investigate the type of relations between c t and the parameters we draw the change in the mean c t while the parameters are varied in their respective ranges while drawing each panel of fig 13 we keep other parameters fixed we observe that there is a positive dependence of concentration on the carrying capacity of humans on the other hand θ μ and k f have negative effects on concentration moreover from the scales of figures it is evident that the depletion rate of atmospheric due to forest cover μ is the most crucial parameter to reduce the average concentration of in the atmosphere also k f can potentially reduce the concentration these results indicate that increasing forest cover is the most effective way to reduce the burden of atmospheric 6 discussions we have presented an environmental system of forest cover human population and atmospheric with the dynamics of human behavioural change the model system shows multiple stable steady states mixed mode oscillations and fascinating changes in the stability properties of equilibrium densities with the effect of social factors the system exhibits bistable dynamics between low and high levels of cooperation due to a high conformist tendency and the same for low and high levels of forest cover due to a high environmental concern when the initial abundance of forest cover is low the model system eventually stays at a high level of forest cover and a high cooperation level of people however for an intermediate to a high level of forest cover with a low cooperation level people do not change their behaviour and the system stays at an intermediate density of forest cover and low cooperation level of people a high level of atmospheric does not lead to change in people s behaviour as people are not concerned about the global elevated level of so increasing the area of forest cover and thus increasing people s environmental concern is the most effective way to reduce the burden of the high level of we were explicitly devoted to exploring how people are concerned with the environment and how their decisions about forest conservation influence the dynamics of the coupled system a reduced level of economic cost can enhance forest cover decrease the atmospheric level and increase the cooperation level besides for a higher strength of economic cost the area of forest cover decreases but enhances the cooperation level of people consequently the decline in forest ecosystems may lead to the degradation of many ecosystem services e g water purification regulation of erosion natural hazard protection etc and increase the risks of nonlinear changes to global ecosystems millennium ecosystem assessment 2005 an increasing level of both conformism of agents and environmental concern has a positive impact on the area of forest cover and cooperation level apart from the impact of social factors an increasing rate of atmospheric level due to anthropogenic factors may pose a direct risk to human health and thus lead to a decrease in the human population a global movement towards the generation of low carbon renewable energy is underway to help reduce global emissions and thus reduce human health risks also increasing the harvesting rate can directly impact the area of forest cover and ultimately decline to zero and thus human population also decreases with an increase in global level the mathematical model is validated using real data on forest cover and atmospheric concentration of for the period 1990 2016 we observed that the model fits the data well in terms of accuracy measures using the estimated parameters we examined the sensitivity of controllable parameters with respect to the mean level of atmospheric nonlinear interaction parameters θ and μ are crucial along with the carrying capacity of the human population we examined the type of relation between the significant model parameters and the atmospheric level using numerical simulations results indicate that the depletion rate of atmospheric due to forest cover is the dominant parameter in reducing the elevated level additionally the carrying capacity of forest cover should be increased to reduce the atmospheric level in this regard reforestation or planting a tree is the easiest and least expensive way to offset the atmospheric because plants of any shape size or genetic origin help to absorb from the air during the photosynthesis process planting trees compared to small plants absorbs more due to their large size and extensive root structure however this could be done without disturbing the balance of the ecosystem devi and gupta 2019 7 conclusions the environment and humans form a single complex system where humans not only influence environmental systems but also react to it these coupled systems are essential to understand the impacts of social interventions and their potential to avoid catastrophic environmental events our coupled socio environmental system demonstrated the importance of modelling human behaviour to understand the diverse and sometimes counterintuitive results of complex interactions between humans and the environment one such result is that after a certain threshold the number of cooperators increases with an increase in the economic cost despite forest cover being very low depletion of atmospheric by increasing forest cover is necessary to reduce the elevated level of and thus mitigate environmental disasters such as climate change and loss of biodiversity this can be attained by increasing the number of conservationists on a global scale our integrated model is focused on human behaviour regarding forest conservation however there is another option to model human behaviour concerning atmospheric level where individual agents adapt behaviour to reduce anthropogenic emissions alternatively one can simultaneously consider both of these perspectives in modelling human behaviour which

boundedness of solutions we have already discussed that 0 p t 1 since p is the fraction of conservationists among humans now we have from system 2 5 d f d t r f f 1 f and d n d t r n n 1 n then from the result of differential inequality lim sup t f t 1 and lim sup t n t 1 also from the system 2 5 d c d t π r n α c π r α c then again from the result of differential inequality lim sup t c t π r α thus all the solutions of system 2 5 are bounded in a region which is given by the set ω f n c p 0 f 1 0 n 1 0 c π r α 0 p 1 a 2 equilibria and stability analysis to get a clear idea of the system dynamics we obtain the steady states or equilibrium points of system 2 5 equilibrium points are the points where the system does not change with respect to time the non dimensionalized coupled system 2 5 has the following four types of equilibrium points forest and human free equilibrium e c p 0 0 π α 1 which always exists human free equilibrium e f c p 1 0 π 1 α p 0 where p 0 is a positive root of the equation ψ p 0 with ψ p 1 1 e β ν ξ p η p forest free equilibrium e n c p 0 α r n π α r n r π r r n α r n r 1 which exists if π α r n interior equilibrium e f n c p where n r n α f π r r n α f c r n π r r r n α f and f p are the positive solution of the following system of equations a 1 r f 1 f h 1 p r n α f π s f r r n α f 0 1 1 e β ν ξ p η f p 0 from the above analysis the existence of human free equilibrium and interior equilibrium is not easily detectable thus we fix the model parameters whose values are given in table 2 with η 0 01 and obtain the numerical value of those equilibrium points for the human free equilibrium e f c p existence depends on the positive roots of the equation ψ p 0 lies between 0 and 1 fig a 14 shows three intersecting points red dots of the curve ψ p with positive p axis in 0 1 thus we get three equilibrium points correlated with these three intersecting points the numerical value of such equilibria are e f c p 1 1 0 0 0012 0 0072 e f c p 2 1 0 0 0012 0 7875 and e f c p 3 1 0 0 0012 0 9039 now we obtain the interior equilibrium point of system 2 5 which is of course our special interest the existence of interior equilibrium depends on the following two facts the growth rate of atmospheric due to non anthropogenic factors π should be less than the threshold value r n α f and the existence of positive root s of system a 1 for the parameter values given in table 2 π r n α r n α f since the system a 1 explicitly depends on the state variables f and p so we plot the nullclines of forest cover and the fraction of conservationists in the f p plane see fig a 15 we observe that there are three intersecting points which are denoted by red dots after some numerical calculation we obtain three interior equilibrium points defined by e 1 0 22349 0 3060 0 07571 0 77152 e 2 0 43565 0 45123 0 05987 0 78126 and e 3 0 8257 0 6037 0 04323 0 90446 now we move towards the stability of the above mentioned equilibrium points the jacobian matrix at the human free equilibrium e f c p 1 0 π 1 α p 0 is given by m e f c p r f h 1 p 0 s 1 0 0 0 r n π 1 α 0 0 π 1 α r 1 α 0 m β η p 0 1 p 0 0 0 m β ξ p 0 1 p 0 1 the above matrix is a block lower triangular matrix if we partition this with horizontal and vertical dashed lines as in the following here d 11 and d 22 are diagonal blocks with the non diagonal block d 21 and is the zero matrix then the characteristic polynomial of m e f c p is the product of the characteristic polynomial of d 11 and d 22 also the blocks d 11 and d 22 are upper triangular and diagonal matrices respectively so the eigenvalues of the matrix m e f c p are the diagonal entries of m e f c p which makes the stability obvious so the equilibrium e f c p is locally asymptotically stable if r n π 1 α and β ξ p 0 1 p 0 1 as a consequence the human population becomes extinct from the coupled socio environment system when its intrinsic growth rate is less than the threshold value π 1 α thus there is a scenario where the human population vanishes however forest cover exists in a stable manner and even reaches to its environmental carrying capacity although for our real data set the equilibrium e f c p is not stable since r n π 1 α the local linearization method or obtaining the jacobian matrix fails to give the local stability of the equilibrium points e c p and e n c p since the one entry of the jacobian matrix is not defined at those points now the jacobian matrix at the interior equilibrium e f n c p is given by m e m 11 m 12 0 m 14 0 m 22 m 23 0 m 31 m 32 m 33 0 m 41 0 0 m 44 where m 11 r f f h f n 1 p s f 2 m 12 h f 1 p s f m 14 h f n s f m 22 r n 1 2 n c m 23 n m 31 c m 32 r m 33 α f m 41 m β η p 1 p f 2 m 44 m β ξ p 1 p 1 now the characteristic equation associated with the jacobian matrix m e given by λ 4 a 1 λ 3 a 2 λ 2 a 3 λ a 4 0 with 1 i a i is the principal minor of m e of order i 1 2 3 4 given by a 1 m 11 m 22 m 33 m 44 trace m e a 2 m 11 m 22 m 33 m 44 m 22 m 33 m 44 m 33 m 44 m 14 m 41 m 23 m 32 a 3 m 14 m 41 m 22 m 33 m 11 m 22 m 33 m 44 m 33 m 44 m 11 m 22 m 23 m 32 m 11 m 44 m 12 m 23 m 31 a 4 m 11 m 22 m 33 m 44 m 14 m 41 m 23 m 32 m 22 m 33 m 23 m 44 m 12 m 31 m 11 m 32 det m e now using the well known routh hurwitz stability criterion the interior equilibrium e is locally asymptotically stable if a 2 a 1 0 a 3 0 a 4 0 and a 3 a 1 a 2 a 3 a 1 2 a 4 0 to gain more information about the stability of interior equilibrium we consider our real data set given in table 2 for the equilibrium e 1 a 1 is negative and for e 2 a 3 is negative so both the equilibria e 1 and e 2 are unstable also for the equilibrium e 3 a 1 1 0858 a 3 0 02 a 4 0 00046869 and a 3 a 1 a 2 a 3 a 1 2 a 4 0 0045 thus all the conditions of the routh hurwitz stability criterion given in a 2 are satisfied for e 3 therefore the interior equilibrium e 3 is locally asymptotically stable for our real data set 
24242,in this article a novel coupled socio environmental model is proposed and analysed using real data the model is formulated with two interconnected subsystems a human environment model that describes the state of forest cover human population and atmospheric carbon dioxide co2 concentration and a socio economic model that represents human behaviour as a dynamical variable human behaviour focuses on their opinion about forest conservation which affects the harvesting rate per unit area we examine the mathematical model analytically and numerically to gain insight into the dynamics of the coupled system by plotting the basin of attractions we show that when an initial abundance of forest cover is small and there is a low fraction of conservationists the system eventually stays at a higher density of forest cover and a higher fraction of conservationists however for intermediate to high values of initial forest cover the system stays at a low forest cover and a low fraction of conservationists among people with an increase in the economic cost after a certain threshold we observe that the number of cooperators increases despite the forest cover being very low further the model is validated using yearly data on forest cover and atmospheric co2 in the period 1990 2016 the fitting to the data is performed using a matlab optimization technique and the quality of the fitting is quantified using accuracy metrics numerical simulations using estimated parameters show that increasing forest cover is essential in reducing the co2 level in the atmosphere from a policy making point of view it is important to increase the proportion of conservationists in the community which will eventually result in increased forest cover and consequently decrease the burden of atmospheric co2 concentration keywords atmospheric co2 logit best response bistability parameter estimation sensitivity data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the climate of the earth changes regularly due to several factors including changes in the earth s orbit changes in the sun s intensity volcanic emissions changes in the ocean currents and changes in greenhouse gas concentrations over the last decades global warming has been an alarming phenomenon concerning the affected population level livelihood and scientific research community the increasing concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide is the main driving force for global warming the elevated level of has reached 418 81 ppm parts per million from its pre industrial level of 280 ppm tans 2012 if it continues like this climate change will become more forbidding in the near future the rate of increase of depends very little on natural causes such as volcanic activity changes in oceanic circulation and melting glaciers the continued growth in atmospheric is not caused directly by human population expansion but by people s activities such as deforestation agricultural transformation wood burning and mainly the increased use of coal petroleum and natural gas for expanding industrialization revelle 1982 newell and marcus 1987 emissions due to such human activities grew at an average rate of 2 6 per year in the period 2000 2014 however this rate was 1 72 per year in 1970 2000 edenhofer 2014 this suggests that human exposure to is higher than previously perceived not only contributes to climate change but also increases human health risks these risks include inflammation kidney calcification reduced higher level cognitive abilities oxidative stress bone demineralization and endothelial dysfunction see jacobson et al 2019 and references cited therein the human population and forests are extremely correlated with the atmospheric concentration of two main driving factors responsible for increasing level are fossil fuel burning and deforestation some individuals are aware of the global situation and behave like conservationists but there are people with the opposite opinion who are doing deforestation here the term conservationist is used to explain only a part of the human population who have not agreed with forest logging rather than those who are aware of the global atmospheric level and adapting behaviour to reduce emissions thus the socio economic choice of people plays an important role in an environmental system we therefore consider the dynamics of the socio economic choice of people together with human environmental dynamics to mitigate the deterioration of our environment few researchers have paid significant attention to studying the environmental coupled socio environmental and socio ecological models in current ecology and environmental science research liu et al 2007 iwasa et al 2010 misra and verma 2013 bauch et al 2016 sun and hilker 2020a iwasa and his coauthors studied the impact of human behaviour on lake water pollution in a series of publications iwasa et al 2007 suzuki and iwasa 2009a b iwasa et al 2010 recently sun and hilker 2020a investigated a socio ecological model considering lake water pollution and human behaviour and showed complex dynamics of the system including multistability and bifurcation in the context of the environmental system misra and verma 2013 studied a mathematical model to explore the impact of atmospheric concentration of on forest biomass and the human population and showed that human populations decline with the increase of anthropogenic emissions bauch et al 2016 studied a coupled human environment model to explore the effect of human behaviour on the dynamics of forest cover they showed rich and complex dynamics of the coupled system and regime shifts compared to the uncoupled system however the dynamics of the human population and atmospheric concentration of were not considered thus we intend to investigate a coupled socio environmental system that considers forest cover the human population atmospheric concentration and the socio economic choice of people to model the socio economic choice of people using a game theoretic approach two different kinds of formulations are familiar logit best response dynamics satake and iwasa 2006 satake et al 2007 sun and hilker 2020a and replicator dynamics tavoni et al 2012 lade et al 2013 bauch et al 2016 mathematical models using the above two formulations may have a different number of equilibria and thus dynamical complexity of the systems differ from each other logit best response dynamics is used to represent the bistability in humans collective choice regarding whether or not to conserve the forest the replicator dynamics model is a limited case of the logit best response model when agents are assumed to behave with infinite rationality however if agents act less rationally then the best response dynamics model is the foremost method to model the socio economic choice of people hopkins 1999 sun and hilker 2020b we therefore consider the logit best response dynamics and refer to the model equation that describes the socio economic choice of people as a socio economic subsystem modelling such a system using logit best response dynamics attributes a new direction to the environmental system hofbauer and sigmund 2003 satake and iwasa 2006 satake et al 2007 our main motivation for this study is to investigate how atmospheric concentration of impacts such coupled socio environmental system we are concerned with the following questions 1 how does the growth rate of atmospheric due to anthropogenic factors impact the growth dynamics of the human population 2 how does the socio environmental system behave when the harvesting rate increases from its standard rate 3 how does the system behave by changing the different values of social factors in general how do the system dynamics changes with the influence of human behaviour the remaining of this article can be organized into three parts in the first part we develop a socio environmental model which is an integrated system of the human environment subsystem and socio economic subsystem then we explore the bistability behaviour among coexistence equilibria next we analyse the impact of social factors on the dynamics of the system and show rich and complex dynamics in the next part we validate our mathematical model using real data and then investigate the sensitivity of important model parameters with respect to the atmospheric concentration of in the last part we discuss our main results and finally provide a brief conclusion 2 model description at this point we formulate our mathematical model which consists of two interconnected subsystems a human environment system and a socio economic system the first part is an environment dynamics model with three state variables forest cover f t human population n t and atmospheric concentration of c t at any time t the second part describes the socio economic system governed by the state variable p t which represents human behaviour as a dynamical variable interacting with environmental dynamics 2 1 human environment subsystem to derive the human environment subsystem model we consider the following assumptions the growth rate of the forest cover at any time t depends only on the quantity of forest present at that time all the other factors affecting the growth rate are constant over time the general shape of the growth function of forest cover is convex with some upper bound the increase of growth function in the low biomass range represents the increase in photosynthetic capacity with increasing leaf area at some stage there is no change and then a decrease in the higher range which represents self interference effects for example shading and competition this type of behaviour of the growth curve is well established both theoretically and experimentally donald 1961 brougham 1955 and the prototypical example is logistic growth the human population clears forests for their needs such as housing paper furniture agriculture logging and several other purposes eckholm 1982 repetto and holmes 1983 garcia montiel and scatena 1994 the consumption function of forest cover by humans is a saturating function that increases at low density of the forest and approaches a threshold value when density is high noy meir 1975 bauch et al 2016 such a function can be characterized by the michaelis function ϕ f h s f where h is the harvesting efficiency and s is the per capita demand for forestry products thus the harvesting rate per unit area is h s f the inverse dependence on f arises because the per unit area demand for forestry products is assumed to increase as the supply f declines the human population also grows logistically further it is assumed that the human population will be decreased due to the death of humans caused by the increase of atmospheric as pointed out in the preceding section poses direct risks to human health such as the incidence of vector borne diseases kidney calcification and bone demineralization jacobson et al 2019 thus we assume that the human population declines with an increase in the concentration of atmospheric the growth rate of atmospheric depends on both anthropogenic and non anthropogenic factors since the anthropogenic emissions depend on human activities therefore we assume that it depends linearly on the human population newell and marcus 1987 onozaki 2009 the growth rate of atmospheric due to non anthropogenic factors like a volcanic eruption melting of glaciers and the respiration process of a living organism is assumed to be a constant π also forests absorb from the atmosphere during the photosynthesis process so the concentration of depletes due to the forest cover the depletion of due to natural sinks other than forests like oceans etc is also considered and it is taken to be proportional to the atmospheric concentration of keeping the above assumptions in mind we consider the following human environment model 2 1 d f d t r f f 1 f k f h f s f d n d t r n n 1 n k n θ c n d c d t π r n α c μ c f the parameters related to the above system are defined in table 1 2 2 socio economic subsystem the socio economic system describes some human behaviour that influences the environment we consider a number of players whose behaviour affects the harvesting rate per unit area of the forest cover players choose between a cooperative but costly option and an economical option their decision is affected by the conservationists present in the community and the importance of forests in the environment suppose that p is the fraction of the human population who do not agree to clear the forest that is forest conservationists whereas 1 p is the fraction of those who clear the forest for their own needs that is non conservationists so it is evident that 0 p 1 thus the part of the total population who are not agreed to clear the forest that is p n are the conservationists cooperators for the socio environmental system therefore when p is small we refer to it as a low level of cooperation among people analogously when p is large we refer to it as a high level of cooperation among people the term cooperation comes from game theory which is not about social interaction but rather about environment friendly behaviour it is to be noted that here we consider p as the fraction of the world s total human population rather than the conservationists in local communities who are close to forests or composed of loggers the choice of each player would be affected by the utility of two options the utility for the conservative option is denoted by g c o n and that of the non conservative option is characterized by g n o n then δ g describes the differences in utility between g c o n and g n o n therefore the differential equation that describes the time evolution of the fraction of conservationists is given by 2 2 d p d t m 1 1 e β δ g p where β represents the rationality of agents and m denotes the speed of human behaviour if β is immense players always take the best option conforming to δ g also when m is small people are more conservative and do not switch their decisions in contrast a large m indicates people are reactive to the change in the total cost for more details about the model formulation see hofbauer and sigmund 2003 satake and iwasa 2006 iwasa et al 2007 2010 suzuki and iwasa 2009b and sun and hilker 2020a now we consider three aspects that describe the differences in utility δ g 1 economic baseline the baseline ν ν 0 is assumed to be negative since it is economically more advantageous for an agent to clear the forest 2 social pressure social pressure or social ostracism is a psychological factor that promotes cooperation it is represented by a linear term in p with parameter ξ accounting for the strength of the agents conformist tendency the more cooperators there are the more people tend to cooperate 3 environmental concern the agents environmental concern is inversely related to the forest cover f with parameter η if the forest cover decreases more people tend to cooperate in reducing the harvesting rate of the forest thus we obtain 2 3 δ g ν economic baseline ξ p social pressure η f environmental concern the above formulation is the same as sun and hilker 2020a except for the environmental concern part this is happening due to lake pollution levels and forest cover are inversely related to the agents concerns this can be explained as when the lake pollution level increases more people tend to cooperate in discharging lower amounts of pollutants sun and hilker 2020a analogously when forest cover decreases more people tend to cooperate in reducing the harvesting rate of the forest also eq 2 3 can be explained as the linearization of the difference in utility as described in suzuki and iwasa 2009b δ g is positive when there are more cooperators than non cooperators and negative for the reverse case as δ g increases the cooperation level also increases with time 2 3 coupled socio environmental system for the uncoupled human environment subsystem 2 1 the harvesting rate per unit area is h s f however in the coupled socio environmental system it becomes h 1 p n s f since in the coupled system only a part of the total population who are non conservationists involves in deforestation also in the uncoupled socio economic system 2 2 the difference in utility δ g depends on f as given in eq 2 3 we combine subsystems 2 1 and 2 2 and the integrated model becomes 2 4 d f d t r f f 1 f k f h f n 1 p

fig 1 before proceeding further with the analysis of the coupled socio environmental model 2 4 we non dimensionalize the model to reduce the number of parameters as well as the complexity associated with the analysis now the dimensionless variables are t μ k f t f 1 k f f n 1 k n n c θ μ k f c and p p since the state variable p describes the fraction of conservationists among total human populations it is already a non dimensionalized quantity also the dimensionless parameters are given in table 2 except for the parameters β ν and ξ which remain unaltered dropping the bar for the simplicity of notation the system 2 4 reduces to 2 5 d f d t r f f 1 f h f n 1 p s f d n d t r n n 1 n c n d c d t π r n α c c f d p d t m 1 1 e β ν ξ p η f p this is the mathematical model we analyse in the following the boundedness of solutions of the system 2 5 can be acquired by the next proposition the proof of which is given in the appendix a 1 proposition 2 1 all the solutions of system 2 5 with positive initial conditions are bounded in a given region which is provided by the set ω f n c p 0 f 1 0 n 1 0 c π r α 0 p 1 also we describe the different types of steady state solutions or equilibrium points of the model system 2 5 and their local behaviour by obtaining the eigenvalues of the corresponding jacobian matrix which are given in appendix a 2 3 results in this section we investigate the dynamics of model 2 5 by changing several controllable parameters the initial condition of the model is fixed to 0 8256 0 528 0 0387 0 2843 also the model parameters are taken from table 2 and the remaining parameters from table 1 unless otherwise specified 3 1 bistability between interior equilibria although the occurrence of bistability is a prevalent result in a mathematical model with logit best response it seems to be interesting as it sometimes predicts the counterintuitive result when the parameter values are fixed according to table 2 except r 0 48 and η 0 05 the coupled model 2 5 exhibit three interior equilibria e 1 0 47286 0 10084 0 09809 0 007916 e 2 0 88786 0 171 0 0904 0 76664 and e 3 0 95935 0 181966 0 089243 0 91413 the equilibria corresponding to the highest and lowest values of the fraction of forest conservationists are stable whereas the equilibrium corresponding to the intermediate value of the fraction of conservationists is unstable in this regard the equilibrium to which the system converges would depend on the initial conditions of the coupled system the stability of equilibria is verified using the condition given in a 2 of appendix a 2 we also draw the basin of attraction for the bistability observed in those equilibria with the lowest and highest level of cooperation of people namely e 1 and e 3 respectively first the initial density of the human population and atmospheric is kept fixed n 0 0 528 and c 0 0 03867 and the f 0 p 0 plane is separated into two regions fig 2a the bluish cyan region corresponds to initial conditions where the system asymptotically converges to the highest level of cooperation of people e 3 and the orange region corresponds to initial conditions where the system converges to the lowest level of cooperation of people e 1 when the initial value of both the cooperation level and forest cover is small the system solutions attract towards the equilibrium of the highest cooperation level such an unexpected outcome occurs as the low level of forest cover increases agents environmental concerns as a result more people tend to cooperate and thus higher cooperation level occurs in contrast if the initial abundance of forest cover is larger than a threshold value with a low cooperation level the system solutions converge to the equilibrium of the lowest cooperation level for an intermediate to a high level of forest cover agents environmental concern is not so strong and thus people are less cooperative in the second case we fixed the initial value of forest cover and human population f 0 0 8256 and n 0 0 528 and the c 0 p 0 plane is separated into two regions fig 2b the meaning of coloured region is the same as earlier for an initial cooperation level below a threshold the system converges to the equilibrium of lowest cooperation and above the threshold value converges to the equilibrium of highest cooperation here the initial density of atmospheric has no role in the convergence of the system towards the equilibrium of low or high cooperation since the atmospheric due to anthropogenic factors consider to be large from its basic value and the people are not concerned with the higher atmospheric concentration of 3 2 effect of social factors here we explain a typical case of how the system dynamics change with different values of social factors our main focus is on how the equilibrium density of forest cover atmospheric and the fraction of conservationists changes in response to social factors and explore some unexpected outcomes which are caused by the nonlinearity of the system such type of results may not explore the dynamical behaviour of the system exhaustively however they are essential from a long term management perspective and policy making we are starting with the variations of economic cost or economic baseline ν the forest cover at equilibrium is maximum when the economic cost is minimal and declines to zero when the economic cost becomes large fig 3a however at an intermediate value of ν forest cover suddenly decreases through several bifurcations first the system around the interior equilibrium becomes unstable through a saddle node or limit point bifurcation lp1 and next the system experiences another saddle node bifurcation lp2 mathematically those lp points are the turning points of the equilibrium density curve and at those points one of the eigenvalues of the corresponding jacobian matrix becomes zero fig 4 lastly the system regains its stability through hopf bifurcation the limit cycle generated through hopf bifurcation is unstable as the first lyapunov coefficient is positive thus the system exhibits a subcritical hopf bifurcation further when we increase the strength of ν the system experiences a limit point bifurcation of cycle where two periodic orbits coalesce and annihilate each other see fig 5 we also observe that the atmospheric level increases with the increasing value of economic cost fig 3b this happens due to the declination of forest cover at the same time it is worth noting that all humans are cooperators when the economic cost is zero from fig 3c we observe that initially the number of cooperators is maximum when ν 0 and then decreases with ν however after a threshold value of ν ν 4 9833 the number of cooperators increases as the forest cover level decreases at the same time this type of counterintuitive result is exhibited due to consideration of human behaviour on the dynamics of the coupled system the minimum number of cooperators attain at the second limit point lp2 where ν 4 9833 next we explore the dynamics of the system by changing the agent s conformist tendency ξ that is the more cooperators there are the more people tend to cooperate when the agent s conformism tendency is too small the area of forest cover is also small and increases with enhancing conformism tendency at the same time atmospheric level decreases we observe a similar but opposite type of changes in the equilibrium density of the forest cover atmospheric and the fraction of conservationists with respect to the agent s conformist tendency fig 6 in this case the dynamical behaviour of the model is the same compared to the variation of economic cost ν lastly we look into the dynamics of the system by varying people s environmental concerns η enhancing the strength of η increases the equilibrium level of forest cover and the fraction of conservationists and thus atmospheric level decreases monotonically fig 7 in this case no changes in the stability properties of the equilibrium point thus increasing people s environmental concern is an impactful factor in reducing global atmospheric level 3 3 mixed mode oscillations mixed mode oscillations mmos are defined as complex oscillatory patterns consisting of pairs of small amplitude oscillations alternate with pairs of large amplitude oscillations mmos typically occur in slow fast systems particularly in an ecological system where the lower trophic level exhibits faster dynamics compared to the higher trophic level sadhu and chakraborty thakur 2017 sadhu 2021 there are several distinct perspectives from the dynamical systems and bifurcation theory to explain the mechanism of mmos see brøns et al 2006 2008 kuehn 2011 and desroches et al 2012 and the references therein mmos appeared in many chemical physical and ecological systems petrov et al 1992 koper 1995 sadhu and chakraborty thakur 2017 to the best of our knowledge mmos appearance in socio environmental or socio ecological systems was not yet explored in the present model system 2 5 we observe oscillations with clearly separated amplitudes and thus result in mixed mode oscillations here the economic baseline ν 5 449 environmental concern η 0 01 and other parameter values are the same as in table 2 see fig 8 ecologically an mmo orbit indicates the adaptability of a species to prolong its successive cycles of outbreaks and collapses 3 4 impact of atmospheric due to anthropogenic factors to investigate how the growth rate of atmospheric due to anthropogenic factors r impact the dynamics of the coupled socio environmental model we consider system 2 5 with the parameter values from table 2 with the same initial condition 0 8256 0 528 0 0387 0 2843 we observe that the system is stable around the interior equilibrium point 0 8257 0 6037 0 0432 0 9044 now for increasing the value of r the human population decreases and becomes extinct from the system when r is enormous and forest cover ultimately converges to its carrying capacity fig 9 this is happening because the atmospheric level increases with an increase in the value of r which leads to more deterioration of human health and eventually reduces the human population also the decline in human population leads to a low harvesting rate and thus forest cover increases therefore increasing level due to human activities is detrimental to the human population whether it is beneficial for forest cover 3 5 impact of harvesting efficiency furthermore we study the impact of harvesting efficiency h on the dynamics of the coupled socio environmental model increasing the harvesting efficiency impacts forest cover directly and reduces forest cover to a zero level fig 10 although it has a positive impact on atmospheric and consequently human population decreases thus deforestation has a negative impact on biodiversity global warming carbon cycling and other ecosystem functions matson et al 1997 cuarón 2000 lewis et al 2004 lawrence and vandecar 2015 also since the forest cover decline with h more people tend to cooperate and thus the number of cooperators increases 4 model validation using real data we use yearly time series data on forest cover and concentration of the world to validate our proposed model 2 4 the forest cover data for the period 1990 to 2016 was collected from the worldbank website 1 1 https data worldbank org indicator ag lnd frst k2 the concentration data for the same period 1990 to 2016 was collected from the ourworldindata website 2 2 https ourworldindata org co2 and other greenhouse gas emissions the human population on the year 1990 is taken from the worldbank website 3 3 https data worldbank org indicator sp pop totl the solution curve of forest cover f t and concentration c t are fitted to data using the built in matlab r2018a simplex algorithm to minimize the sum of squares difference between simulated indicators and data we used the matlab function fminsearchbnd to perform the optimization during computation 100 different starting points in parameter space are chosen using latin hypercube sampling to ensure consistency and uniqueness of the parameter estimates the fitting is displayed in fig 11a for forest cover and in fig 11b for concentration the fixed parameters are taken from table 1 the initial conditions are taken as f 0 412 8 n 0 528 c 0 354 39 which come from actual data in the year 1990 see the urls in the footnote and the initial fraction of conservationists is estimated from data we also estimated six parameters viz h θ μ r f m and η the estimated parameters are found to be h 0 0024 θ 0 00012 μ 0 0022 r f 0 0093 m 0 5088 η 22 3269 and p 0 0 2843 to check the accuracy of model fitting we calculate the mean absolute error mae and root mean squared error rmse the accuracy measures for forest cover are found to be mae 1 1649 and rmse 1 3338 for the concentration data mae 3 6128 and rmse 4 2756 this indicates that the model fitting to both time series data is quite good 5 global sensitivity analysis in this section we investigate the sensitivity of important model parameters with respect to the concentration of in the atmosphere we use a variance based method to find the global sensitivity indices of the important input parameters we use sobol s method sobol 1990 to find sensitivity indices of the parameters θ μ η m h r f k f and k n with respect to the mean of concentration in the atmosphere the response is chosen as a mean of atmospheric concentration over 100 years here the response variable is a measure of risk for the concentration of in the atmosphere this global sensitivity technique is based on the decomposition of the variance of response variables onto the summation of variances of the model parameters in increasing dimensionality sobol 1990 cariboni et al 2007 nossent et al 2011 uniform distributions of the input parameters are used to draw 500 samples from their respective ranges the parameter values are taken from table 1 and the other parameters are the estimated values the total order sobol sensitivity indices of the model parameters are depicted in fig 12 the parameters θ μ and k n are found highly sensitive with respect to the concentration of see fig 12 these results give a clear indication that the concentration of c t varies the most with variation in the nonlinear interaction coefficients θ and μ and the carrying capacity of humans however to investigate the type of relations between c t and the parameters we draw the change in the mean c t while the parameters are varied in their respective ranges while drawing each panel of fig 13 we keep other parameters fixed we observe that there is a positive dependence of concentration on the carrying capacity of humans on the other hand θ μ and k f have negative effects on concentration moreover from the scales of figures it is evident that the depletion rate of atmospheric due to forest cover μ is the most crucial parameter to reduce the average concentration of in the atmosphere also k f can potentially reduce the concentration these results indicate that increasing forest cover is the most effective way to reduce the burden of atmospheric 6 discussions we have presented an environmental system of forest cover human population and atmospheric with the dynamics of human behavioural change the model system shows multiple stable steady states mixed mode oscillations and fascinating changes in the stability properties of equilibrium densities with the effect of social factors the system exhibits bistable dynamics between low and high levels of cooperation due to a high conformist tendency and the same for low and high levels of forest cover due to a high environmental concern when the initial abundance of forest cover is low the model system eventually stays at a high level of forest cover and a high cooperation level of people however for an intermediate to a high level of forest cover with a low cooperation level people do not change their behaviour and the system stays at an intermediate density of forest cover and low cooperation level of people a high level of atmospheric does not lead to change in people s behaviour as people are not concerned about the global elevated level of so increasing the area of forest cover and thus increasing people s environmental concern is the most effective way to reduce the burden of the high level of we were explicitly devoted to exploring how people are concerned with the environment and how their decisions about forest conservation influence the dynamics of the coupled system a reduced level of economic cost can enhance forest cover decrease the atmospheric level and increase the cooperation level besides for a higher strength of economic cost the area of forest cover decreases but enhances the cooperation level of people consequently the decline in forest ecosystems may lead to the degradation of many ecosystem services e g water purification regulation of erosion natural hazard protection etc and increase the risks of nonlinear changes to global ecosystems millennium ecosystem assessment 2005 an increasing level of both conformism of agents and environmental concern has a positive impact on the area of forest cover and cooperation level apart from the impact of social factors an increasing rate of atmospheric level due to anthropogenic factors may pose a direct risk to human health and thus lead to a decrease in the human population a global movement towards the generation of low carbon renewable energy is underway to help reduce global emissions and thus reduce human health risks also increasing the harvesting rate can directly impact the area of forest cover and ultimately decline to zero and thus human population also decreases with an increase in global level the mathematical model is validated using real data on forest cover and atmospheric concentration of for the period 1990 2016 we observed that the model fits the data well in terms of accuracy measures using the estimated parameters we examined the sensitivity of controllable parameters with respect to the mean level of atmospheric nonlinear interaction parameters θ and μ are crucial along with the carrying capacity of the human population we examined the type of relation between the significant model parameters and the atmospheric level using numerical simulations results indicate that the depletion rate of atmospheric due to forest cover is the dominant parameter in reducing the elevated level additionally the carrying capacity of forest cover should be increased to reduce the atmospheric level in this regard reforestation or planting a tree is the easiest and least expensive way to offset the atmospheric because plants of any shape size or genetic origin help to absorb from the air during the photosynthesis process planting trees compared to small plants absorbs more due to their large size and extensive root structure however this could be done without disturbing the balance of the ecosystem devi and gupta 2019 7 conclusions the environment and humans form a single complex system where humans not only influence environmental systems but also react to it these coupled systems are essential to understand the impacts of social interventions and their potential to avoid catastrophic environmental events our coupled socio environmental system demonstrated the importance of modelling human behaviour to understand the diverse and sometimes counterintuitive results of complex interactions between humans and the environment one such result is that after a certain threshold the number of cooperators increases with an increase in the economic cost despite forest cover being very low depletion of atmospheric by increasing forest cover is necessary to reduce the elevated level of and thus mitigate environmental disasters such as climate change and loss of biodiversity this can be attained by increasing the number of conservationists on a global scale our integrated model is focused on human behaviour regarding forest conservation however there is another option to model human behaviour concerning atmospheric level where individual agents adapt behaviour to reduce anthropogenic emissions alternatively one can simultaneously consider both of these perspectives in modelling human behaviour which

boundedness of solutions we have already discussed that 0 p t 1 since p is the fraction of conservationists among humans now we have from system 2 5 d f d t r f f 1 f and d n d t r n n 1 n then from the result of differential inequality lim sup t f t 1 and lim sup t n t 1 also from the system 2 5 d c d t π r n α c π r α c then again from the result of differential inequality lim sup t c t π r α thus all the solutions of system 2 5 are bounded in a region which is given by the set ω f n c p 0 f 1 0 n 1 0 c π r α 0 p 1 a 2 equilibria and stability analysis to get a clear idea of the system dynamics we obtain the steady states or equilibrium points of system 2 5 equilibrium points are the points where the system does not change with respect to time the non dimensionalized coupled system 2 5 has the following four types of equilibrium points forest and human free equilibrium e c p 0 0 π α 1 which always exists human free equilibrium e f c p 1 0 π 1 α p 0 where p 0 is a positive root of the equation ψ p 0 with ψ p 1 1 e β ν ξ p η p forest free equilibrium e n c p 0 α r n π α r n r π r r n α r n r 1 which exists if π α r n interior equilibrium e f n c p where n r n α f π r r n α f c r n π r r r n α f and f p are the positive solution of the following system of equations a 1 r f 1 f h 1 p r n α f π s f r r n α f 0 1 1 e β ν ξ p η f p 0 from the above analysis the existence of human free equilibrium and interior equilibrium is not easily detectable thus we fix the model parameters whose values are given in table 2 with η 0 01 and obtain the numerical value of those equilibrium points for the human free equilibrium e f c p existence depends on the positive roots of the equation ψ p 0 lies between 0 and 1 fig a 14 shows three intersecting points red dots of the curve ψ p with positive p axis in 0 1 thus we get three equilibrium points correlated with these three intersecting points the numerical value of such equilibria are e f c p 1 1 0 0 0012 0 0072 e f c p 2 1 0 0 0012 0 7875 and e f c p 3 1 0 0 0012 0 9039 now we obtain the interior equilibrium point of system 2 5 which is of course our special interest the existence of interior equilibrium depends on the following two facts the growth rate of atmospheric due to non anthropogenic factors π should be less than the threshold value r n α f and the existence of positive root s of system a 1 for the parameter values given in table 2 π r n α r n α f since the system a 1 explicitly depends on the state variables f and p so we plot the nullclines of forest cover and the fraction of conservationists in the f p plane see fig a 15 we observe that there are three intersecting points which are denoted by red dots after some numerical calculation we obtain three interior equilibrium points defined by e 1 0 22349 0 3060 0 07571 0 77152 e 2 0 43565 0 45123 0 05987 0 78126 and e 3 0 8257 0 6037 0 04323 0 90446 now we move towards the stability of the above mentioned equilibrium points the jacobian matrix at the human free equilibrium e f c p 1 0 π 1 α p 0 is given by m e f c p r f h 1 p 0 s 1 0 0 0 r n π 1 α 0 0 π 1 α r 1 α 0 m β η p 0 1 p 0 0 0 m β ξ p 0 1 p 0 1 the above matrix is a block lower triangular matrix if we partition this with horizontal and vertical dashed lines as in the following here d 11 and d 22 are diagonal blocks with the non diagonal block d 21 and is the zero matrix then the characteristic polynomial of m e f c p is the product of the characteristic polynomial of d 11 and d 22 also the blocks d 11 and d 22 are upper triangular and diagonal matrices respectively so the eigenvalues of the matrix m e f c p are the diagonal entries of m e f c p which makes the stability obvious so the equilibrium e f c p is locally asymptotically stable if r n π 1 α and β ξ p 0 1 p 0 1 as a consequence the human population becomes extinct from the coupled socio environment system when its intrinsic growth rate is less than the threshold value π 1 α thus there is a scenario where the human population vanishes however forest cover exists in a stable manner and even reaches to its environmental carrying capacity although for our real data set the equilibrium e f c p is not stable since r n π 1 α the local linearization method or obtaining the jacobian matrix fails to give the local stability of the equilibrium points e c p and e n c p since the one entry of the jacobian matrix is not defined at those points now the jacobian matrix at the interior equilibrium e f n c p is given by m e m 11 m 12 0 m 14 0 m 22 m 23 0 m 31 m 32 m 33 0 m 41 0 0 m 44 where m 11 r f f h f n 1 p s f 2 m 12 h f 1 p s f m 14 h f n s f m 22 r n 1 2 n c m 23 n m 31 c m 32 r m 33 α f m 41 m β η p 1 p f 2 m 44 m β ξ p 1 p 1 now the characteristic equation associated with the jacobian matrix m e given by λ 4 a 1 λ 3 a 2 λ 2 a 3 λ a 4 0 with 1 i a i is the principal minor of m e of order i 1 2 3 4 given by a 1 m 11 m 22 m 33 m 44 trace m e a 2 m 11 m 22 m 33 m 44 m 22 m 33 m 44 m 33 m 44 m 14 m 41 m 23 m 32 a 3 m 14 m 41 m 22 m 33 m 11 m 22 m 33 m 44 m 33 m 44 m 11 m 22 m 23 m 32 m 11 m 44 m 12 m 23 m 31 a 4 m 11 m 22 m 33 m 44 m 14 m 41 m 23 m 32 m 22 m 33 m 23 m 44 m 12 m 31 m 11 m 32 det m e now using the well known routh hurwitz stability criterion the interior equilibrium e is locally asymptotically stable if a 2 a 1 0 a 3 0 a 4 0 and a 3 a 1 a 2 a 3 a 1 2 a 4 0 to gain more information about the stability of interior equilibrium we consider our real data set given in table 2 for the equilibrium e 1 a 1 is negative and for e 2 a 3 is negative so both the equilibria e 1 and e 2 are unstable also for the equilibrium e 3 a 1 1 0858 a 3 0 02 a 4 0 00046869 and a 3 a 1 a 2 a 3 a 1 2 a 4 0 0045 thus all the conditions of the routh hurwitz stability criterion given in a 2 are satisfied for e 3 therefore the interior equilibrium e 3 is locally asymptotically stable for our real data set 
24243,diverse public policies encourage farmers to adopt eco friendly practices to address the issue of diffuse pollution from agriculture including measures based on the provision of information on the environment indeed farmers perception of the state of the water body and their awareness of the causes and consequences of water pollution affect their willingness to adopt eco friendly farming practices public policies therefore have a role to play in disseminating environmental information in this article we investigate how information measures may exert influence on changes in farming practices and thereby water pollution we extend an existing agent based model of a social ecological system representing a drinking water catchment area in the decision making process based on the theory of planned behaviour we integrate a dynamical environmental component of farmers attitude towards eco friendly practices in order to take into account the effect of information on the ecological system we explore the impact of information measures heterogeneity in farmers environmental preferences and variations in the initial level of water pollution on farmers participation to a water catchment protection programme our results show that 1 targeting farmers who have higher environmental preferences is more effective than no targeting 2 the heterogeneity in farmers environmental preferences impacts their involvement in the programme depending on the average environmental preferences 3 the higher the initial pollution the higher the farmers are involved in the protection programme 4 when two different measures are combined once a certain threshold of public awareness is reached there is a synergy between them keywords agent based model governance information social ecological system theory of planned behaviour water quality data availability i have shared the link to my code in the manuscript 1 introduction the world s freshwater resources face different sources of pollution organic waste pathogens fertilizers and pesticides heavy metals or emerging pollutants un water 2020 these pollutions lead to a degradation of water quality with various economic social and environmental consequences fao 2011 more specifically in the case of the production of drinking water restoring and protecting water quality is an important issue due to the impact of pollution on health and the increased production costs for providing drinking water bommelear et al 2011 water quality refers to the chemical physical and biological dimensions of water based on the standards of its usage in europe for instance the european union drinking water directive set the legal framework to protect human health from the adverse effects of any contamination of water intended for human consumption by ensuring that it is wholesome and clean it defines and values a set of bacteriological physico chemical and radiological parameters european parliament and council 2020 because farming practices are one of the major sources of diffuse pollution in drinking water catchment areas understanding farmers motivations to adopt eco friendly practices may provide new insights for designing efficient policies among the various factors that influence farmers choices regarding agricultural practices promoted by environmental policies see for instance dessart et al 2019 their perception of water quality i e the subjective evaluation of water quality is an important one amblard 2019 bosc and doussan 2009 gachango et al 2015 lubell et al 2002 moser 1984 michel guillou 2009 for example gachango et al 2015 found that in specific areas in denmark farmers perceive the water quality to be above average the effective water quality and consequently they feel that the removal of the regulatory measures would have little or no effect in terms of reducing the water quality the decision making process of farmers was also shown to be influenced by their awareness of the consequences of water pollution michel guillou and moser 2006 their awareness of the consequences of their farming practices hu and morton 2011 or their environmental concern i e their interest in water quality and sense of responsibility towards the environment toma and mathijs 2007 recent studies show that farmers do not behave in favour of water quality due to a lack of information perspective and understanding of the benefits of eco friendly behaviours popp and rodrigez 2007 floress et al 2017 inman et al 2018 okumah et al 2018 thus public policies have a major role to play in disseminating information on water quality and on the consequences of water pollution indeed information measures may improve the effect of financial or regulatory instruments sheeder lynne 2011 barnes et al 2013 kuhfuss et al 2016 land managers such as farmers are different in terms of their constraints to change the factors that motivate their decisions or in how they balance business social and personal factors liu et al 2018 dessart et al 2019 this diversity means that different types of information may be required at different times with differing degrees of advice and prescription for environmental policies garforth et al 2003 thus recognising the diversity of farming styles related to management decisions is essential in supporting the integrated management of diffuse agricultural pollution for addressing such issues we extended an agent based model of a drinking water catchment area bourceret et al 2022 the conceptual framework of the model is based on the social ecological systems ses framework ostrom 2009 mcginnis and ostrom 2014 the ses framework was developed from the institutional analysis and development iad approach ostrom 2011 for analysing the governance of common pool resources ostrom 2007 2009 it is now being used more widely including for the analysis of the various public goods and services generated by sess mcginnis and ostrom 2014 ban et al 2015 bennett and gosnell 2015 the model represents a water catchment area where farmers decide on their farming practices which impact water quality the decision making process of farmers is based on the theory of planned behaviour and takes into account social influences as well as the heterogeneity of farmers we integrate the influence of the perception of water quality in farmers motivations through a dynamical environmental component of the attitude towards eco friendly practices the main purpose of the model is to perform a dynamical analysis of the adoption of low input farming practices we use this model to simulate behavioural reactions of farmers who are sensitive to the quality of the water to policy interventions in section 2 we present an overview of the impact of information policies on water pollution before describing the agent based model of a water catchment area in section 3 this model allows us to analyse the impact of information related instruments on water quality section 4 first we characterise the effectiveness of different water quality protection programmes we focus on the role of two types of information measures one measure based on the provision of information about the concentration of pollutants in water and a second measure including additionally the provision of information about the consequences of the pollution section 4 1 second we assess the impact of the state of the water body here a groundwater body on farmers decisions more particularly we analyse the impact of the initial concentration of pollutants in water on farmers behaviour section 4 2 third we characterise how the diversity amongst farmers affects policy effectiveness with a focus on the heterogeneity in environmental preferences section 4 3 finally we discuss our findings and results in section 5 2 overview of the impact of information based policies on water pollution first we present how information based policy instruments may complement regulatory and financial instruments in the context of water quality management then we discuss how the water quality and awareness of water quality issues influence the decision making process of farmers with regard to the adoption of eco friendly practices 2 1 information instruments for enhancing water quality environmental policy instruments include a diversity of instruments such as economic command and control and information instruments villamayor et al 2019 economic instruments rely on market forces and changes in relative prices to modify the behaviour of actors in a way that supports environmental protection or improvement command and control tools influence environmental outcomes by regulating processes or products limiting the discharge of specified pollutants and by restricting some polluting activities to specific times or areas although these instruments have demonstrated their effectiveness for managing environmental problems they have shown some limitations in the case of agricultural nonpoint source water pollution shortle et al 2012 for instance economic incentives alone do not account for changes in farming practice that improve water quality because of a dual self and others interests czap et al 2012 sheeder lynne 2011 barnes et al 2013 highlight a vicious circle of regulation of water pollution coercive behaviour due to regulation creates a negative perception of water pollution issues and ultimately leads to a greater need for regulation information instruments imply a voluntary commitment of farmers to adopt practices in favour of water quality they include public education and information campaigns the concept of nudge developed in behavioural economics refers to the provision of information that influences the decision making of individuals without changing the structure of economic incentives or restricting their available options for example kuhfuss et al 2016 found a positive effect of information on a social norm as a behavioural nudge on the maintenance of practices promoted by agri environmental schemes the information may be used in a complementary way to enhance the effect of an economic instrument barnes et al 2013 also found that nudges play a positive role in the implementation of regulatory policies targeting water quality an optimal mix of policies can lead to positive effects on water quality villamayor et al 2019 highlighted that information based policies can be based on either 1 providing information in a relatively neutral way or 2 providing an appropriate interpretation of the information to guide behaviour in a particular direction for example the authority in charge of water management can monitor the concentration of pollutants in water and inform farmers about it an alternative action is to provide information about the consequences of this pollution in order to raise awareness according to lastra bravo et al 2015 and okumah et al 2021 training awareness raising and information for farmers are key elements that promote eco friendly practices awareness raising of the environmental consequences of farming is generally considered a necessary step towards the adoption of practices that improve water quality blackstock et al 2010 ervin ervin 1982 prokopy et al 2008 blackstock et al 2010 based on a literature review highlighted that raising awareness amongst farmers can alone be effective in persuading farmers to adopt favourable water practices the information provided to improve water quality can concern different aspects such as the behaviour of others the environmental consequences of farming or the level of degradation of the resource we focus particularly on the information on the water resource 2 2 influence of water quality on the decision making process in the adoption of farming practices promoted by environmental policies in the field of drinking water management the level of water contamination by nitrates and or pesticides was found to play an important role in stakeholders incentives to cooperate in the protection of drinking water catchments lubell et al 2002 bosc and doussan 2009 several studies have shown how the threat of applying regulatory measures when the level of pollution is high may stimulate the involvement of agricultural stakeholders in collective action to protect water catchments and watersheds hardy and koontz 2010 grolleau and mccann 2012 amblard 2019 by contrast some studies have noted that the good quality of the water resource i e the absence of water pollution can constitute an impediment to agricultural stakeholders involvement garin and barraqué 2012 amblard 2019 the good quality of the water resource appears to be an obstacle to the participation of farmers who question the legitimacy of undertaking costly changes in their farming practices in the absence of any observed pollution amblard 2019 moreover the concern of farmers for the environment impacts their adoption of sustainable practices toma and mathijs 2007 best 2010 jaeck and lifran 2014 d souza et al 1993 found that farmers who are aware of on farm environmental issues are more likely to implement sustainable practices floress et al 2017 found a positive relationship between awareness of water quality problems and farmers willingness to adopt actions to improve water quality in indiana identically michel guillou and moser 2006 showed that farmers who have adopted pro environmental practices feel more involved in this problem than farmers who have maintained traditional practices indeed while some farmers may recognise the impact of agricultural practices on water quality e g ward et al 1995 hu and morton 2011 other farmers may not be aware of these consequences e g popp and rodrigez 2007 moreover some farmers may have a negative opinion of the environmental benefits of water management e g barnes et al 2009 morton et al 2017 inman et al 2018 this brief review highlights the importance of information based instruments in environmental management which constitutes the main motivation for our modelling approach we focus on information about the state of the water body and therefore we developed a model involving actors whose decision making process partially depends on the state of the water body in a context where a mix of policies includes information instruments 3 a social ecological model integrating the impact of information based instruments we extend an agent based model of a social ecological system ses from a previous study bourceret et al 2022 this model representing a water catchment area uses the theory of planned behaviour tpb this theory has been frequently applied for predicting human behaviour more particularly to understand farmers behaviour in a voluntary policy context sok et al 2020 first we present the core elements of the model previously developed section 3 1 second we present the adaptations made to the model to analyse the effect of an information policy on farming practices section 3 2 see appendix 1 for the overview design concepts and details odd protocol description the code is available here https github com abourceret behaviouraldynamicsinses git modeleinformationinstruments nlogo 3 1 existing tpb based model of a drinking water catchment as a ses in the existing model bourceret et al 2022 individual farmers are connected in a social network and their decision of whether or not to join a catchment protection programme and thus to practice low input farming promoted by the programme is based on the tpb ajzen 1991 each farmer has an intention to change to low input practices i e a level of motivation to adopt a low input practice based on three independent factors the attitude subjective norm and perceived behavioural control following different studies defrancesco et al 2007 mettepenningen et al 2013 falconer 2000 we described the attitude as the financial and environmental judgement about the desirability of adopting the low input farming practice the considerations about the influence and opinions of others on the behaviour of interest define the subjective norm ajzen 1991 farmers decisions are influenced by the practices of farmers belonging to their social network the perceived behavioural control is the aggregation of past experiences knowledge and qualification ajzen 1991 farmers with an intention higher than a personal threshold will change to low input farming 3 1 1 water body the water used for drinking water production is extracted from a water body the water body sub model is a linear reservoir model whose storage law and discharge law vary linearly as a function of the water level we consider that the quantities of water feeding and leaving natural flow and extracted water the water body system are equal and constant over time the concentration of pollutants in water c t in mg l is used as a proxy to measure water quality we assume that diffuse pollution from agricultural activities is the only source of water body pollution and that only high input farming practices lead to residual pollutants in the water body 3 1 2 actors 3 1 2 1 decision process the intention to change to low input farming practices i i t is a linear function of the three basic factors 1 i i t s i t a i t p where s i t is the subjective norm linked to the behaviour of others a i t is the attitude i e the judgement of farmer i on the desirability of changing to low input farming practices and on the consequences of this change p is the perceived control of behaviour representing the beliefs of the farmer on his or her ability to adopt the low input farming practice depending on the level of ii t and on a behavioural threshold the farmer will choose whether or not to change their farming practices bi t 2 i f i i t ω i t h e n b i t 1 l the value of the behavioural threshold ωi is distributed among the population according to a normal law thus it is different for each simulation this distribution is chosen to represent the diversity among individuals and the fact that the intention although relatively good at predicting behaviour is not a perfect predictor 3 1 2 2 factors 3 1 2 2 1 subjective norm the subjective norm is the agent s perception of what the other people who are important to the agent the farmers in the network of the agent think the agent should or should not do each farmer has its own network farmers in a network can communicate about their farming practices we assume that what the farmer believes that the other important people think the agent should or should not do is equivalent to what the other important people do thus the subjective norm is equal to the share of low input farmers in the network of the farmer this factor is dynamic and evolves during the simulation dotted line in fig 1 we represent the farmer s network as partly based on spatial criteria of proximity folowing the literature and partly random e g schmidtner et al 2012 läpple and kelley 2015 we used the algorithm of the small worlds model developed in netlogo by wilensky 2015 we set the parameters to fit our case in terms of number and characteristics of initial connections and rewiring probability see appendix 2 for the clustering coefficient and the average shortest path length farmers are initially located randomly on a lattice for each simulation at the initialization of the network of the farmers network each farmer is connected to his neighbors located on nearby plots xi 1 yi 1 i e maximum eight neighbours then each connection has a 50 probability of being rewired to another random farmer the farmers with whom the farmer is connected represent its network therefore a farmer s network is on average composed for half of farmers in his neighborhood xi 6 1 yi 1 nd for half by randomly located farmers 3 1 2 2 2 perceived behavioural control the perceived behavioural control is the perception of the ease and difficulty of performing the behaviour this factor is static and the same for all farmers in the model we represent the perceived behavioural control as the initial aggregation of past experiences knowledge and qualification and new knowledge acquired with the protection programme we assume that the initial perceived behavioural control is zero and the same for all farmers 3 1 2 2 3 attitude the attitude ai t comprises two components a financial component f and an environmental component ei t 3 3 a i t e i t w i f 1 w i 4 f π l π h φ π h π l the financial attitude towards the protection programme and its implementation f is the difference between the low input farming and high input farming gross margins normalized 4 the costs of change can be a barrier to the intention of changing farming practices π h and π l are respectively the gross margin of the high input farming practice and of the low input farming practice compensation φ can be provided to farmers depending on the protection programme e i t is the environmental component of the attitude i e the perception of the concentration of pollutants and the awareness of the consequences of the farming practices and of pollution its calculation is described in section 3 2 following several authors we use the term preference to describe the relative weight of the components of the attitude and more specifically environmental preference to describe the relative weight of the environmental component of the attitude w i e g verwaart et al 2011 robinson and ray 2015 muelder and filatova 2018 3 2 integrating a dynamical environmental component of the attitude and information measures 3 2 1 environmental component of the attitude based on the existing model we developed the conceptual foundations for explaining the attitude of agents towards the environment e i t the purpose of the proposed agent based model is to explore how the choice by farmers who are connected in a network to join a protection programme and thus to practice low input farming promoted by the programme see fig 1 is influenced by the environmental component of the attitude the agent based model is implemented in netlogo version 6 0 3 wilensky 1999 all parameters value ranges and sources of values can be found in appendix 3 e i t is the environmental component of the attitude a i which is the judgement of farmer i on the desirability of changing to low input farming practices thus e i t is the judgement of farmer i on the environmental desirability of changing to low input farming practices the environmental component of the attitude depends on three parameters 1 the perception of the concentration of pollutants c i t 2 an individual awareness threshold α 3 a sensitivity to this awareness threshold q following mathias et al 2020 we chose a function based on a sigmoid shape s shaped if farmers perceive a good water quality they judge that there is no environmental desirability for them to change to low input farming practices the perception of a high concentration of pollutants implies a belief in the importance of changing practices that contribute to increasing the environmental component of the attitude 5 e i t c i t q c i t q α q α is the awareness threshold for a favourable attitude and it corresponds to the environmental attitude inflection point see fig 2 around this awareness threshold the environmental attitude increases quickly if ci t α e i t 0 5 q is the degree of sensitivity to change in the environmental attitude if q is high then the farmer will have a rapid change in environmental attitude and if q is low then the change in environmental attitude will be more gradual we set q 5 which implies a relatively high rate of environmental attitude change note that other high values of q yielding sudden perception change will not change the results qualitatively c i t can be informed by the authority in charge of water quality management or can be the belief of the farmers if they do not have any information about the pollution level if the farmer receives the information about the concentration of pollutants in the water then ci t c t this information received depends on a parameter of the system of governance see below if the farmer receives no information about the concentration of pollutants in the water then ci t ci we assumed that on average farmers in our model at the initialisation of the model if they do not have information about the concentration of the water perceive the concentration of pollutants in the water to be lower than in reality indeed we followed gachango et al 2015 who found in their study that farmers on average perceive the water quality to be above the effective water quality ci t 0 c t 0 the belief is distributed at the initialisation of the model and is different for each simulation the belief regarding the concentration is distributed among the population according to a normal law and is stable during the simulation 3 2 2 information measures a protection programme aiming at protecting the drinking water catchment is implemented the farmer may or may not choose to participate in the programme if the farmers enter the programme they must change their farming practices to low input farming the protection programme is based on a combination of the following measures financial compensation training and information the duration of the programme is 5 years the financial compensation and training measures are fixed for all simulations they are considered as fixed parameters in the programme in order to study the impact of information based measures the financial compensation and the training influence the calculation of the financial component of attitude and the perceived behavioural control more details about the specific results on bourceret et al 2022 financial compensation fixed measure in what follows this measure is based on agri environmental schemes of the common agricultural policy cap of the european union farmers voluntarily commit to adopting eco friendly farming practices in return for financial compensation this compensation aims at covering the costs and income losses resulting from the change as well as transaction costs it influences the economic profits associated with a farming practice hence the financial aspect of the attitude the compensation is annual for 5 years in the following analysis we fixed the amount of compensation φ at 300 year which covers exactly the difference between the gross margins of low input and high input farming practices πh and πl this implies that the financial component of the attitude is equal to zero training fixed measure in what follows technical support and individual training are individual support measures to farmers when they change their practices e g technical advice meetings technical tests experiments in the model this measure affects the perceived control by increasing farmers knowledge about a farming practice knowledge persists in time in the following analysis the training intensity θ is fixed at 0 75 we focus on two information measures that influence the environmental component of attitude information measure about the pollution level the information given to the farmers is the monitored concentration of pollutants in the water body this measure can target all farmers or a certain share of farmers depending on the intensity of information diffusion m when a farmer is concerned by the information measure she receives information about the pollutant concentration at each time step one year the information modifies ci t in the calculation of the environmental component of attitude eq 4 information measure about the negative consequences of water pollution on health economy and biodiversity termed awareness raising measure in what follows the objective is to lower the awareness threshold of farmers therefore the information will modify α in the calculation of the environmental component of attitude eq 4 the modification of the awareness threshold for a farmer is permanent 3 3 simulations the impact of information measures on farmers behaviour and thus on water quality was explored by realizing three sets of simulations see table 1 for the parameters of simulations all simulations were performed 1000 times to give representative results on average see appendix 4 for standard deviations of the results in the first and second sets of simulations we explored the effect of the information measures in the context of two specific groups of farmers gathering 50 of farmers with similar environmental preferences ep within each group the eco friendly and economicus groups the eco friendly farmers place more emphasis on the environment than do the economicus farmers who attach more importance to economic profits hence the ep for the eco friendly farmers w i 0 5 is higher than the ep for the economicus farmers w i 0 1 in the first set of simulations we analysed the impact of both information based measures on the evolution of farmers practices by considering the eco friendly and economicus groups of farmers first we tested the impact of the information measure about the level of pollution on the evolution of low input practices and on the concentration of pollutants in water then we analysed the effect of targeting farmers according to their eps finally we tested the effect of the combined measures of providing information about the pollution level and information about the consequences of pollution awareness raising measure in this first set of simulations we assume that the initial concentration of pollutants corresponds to a stationary state before the implementation of the protection programme all farmers initially practice high input agriculture and consequently the initial concentration of pollutants in water is equal to 50 mg l however we suppose that the initial concentration may change the intention of farmers to practice low input farming in order to analyse how this influences policy effectiveness we tested the effect of different initial concentrations of pollutants in the water in a second set of simulations to simplify the analysis we keep the assumption about the composition of the populationt half of the farmers are eco friendly and half are economicus in a third set of simulations we consider a more general case with two groups of the same size whose eps may vary indeed in the first and second simulations we investigate the case of a moderate ep for the eco friendly farmers and a low ep for the economicus farmers we now consider the general case where the population is still split into two equal sized groups and within each group all individuals exhibit the same ep denoted w1 for farmers of group 1 and w2 for farmers of group 2 we expect that different ep combinations between groups may lead to changes in the effectiveness of the information measure about the level of pollution targeting all farmers 4 results in this section we present the results of the simulations aimed at exploring how information measures and farmers eps influence water quality section 4 1 presents how information based measures impact the evolution of farmers practices and water pollution levels we then present the results obtained regarding the influence of the initial pollution level on policy effectiveness section 4 2 finally how the heterogeneity in farmers eps impacts the effectiveness of the information measures is detailed in section 4 3 4 1 information based measures enhance farmers participation in protection programmes 4 1 1 policy effectiveness depends on the share of farmers concerned by the information measure we assume that policy makers can choose the intensity of information dissemination e g the amount of money allocated to the information measure which translates in the model into the percentage of farmers affected by the information measure about the water pollution level the final share of low input farmers increases with the share of farmers targeted by the information measure approximately linearly from 29 to 40 see fig 3 the concentration of pollutants also follows a linear decrease in both eco friendly and economicus farmers groups the final share of low input farmers increases with the share of farmers affected by the information measure nevertheless whatever the informed farmers share the final share of low input eco friendly farmers is higher than the final share of low input economicus farmers that is because the subjective norm and the perceived behavioural control are the same for both groups and only the attitude which is different between groups is higher for eco friendly farmers due to a financial compensation set as the difference in profit between the two farming practices see section 3 2 3 the financial component of attitude is equal to zero consequently only the environmental component of attitude plays a role in the attitude which is higher for eco friendly farmers 4 1 2 targeting farmers according to their environmental preference in addition to choosing how many farmers are affected by the information measure on the concentration of pollutants policy makers can select which groups of farmers according to their ep will be targeted by the information measure indeed depending on how the information is disseminated it could affect different groups of farmers for example information can be disseminated through a cooperative that gathers the same type of farmer through an agricultural magazine read by a certain type of farmer or through a network to which only one type of farmer belongs e g the dephy network in france brings together farmers committed to a voluntary approach for reducing the use of pesticides thus likely to have higher eps lapierre et al 2018 we compared four different policies in relation to the targeting of farmers 1 only eco friendly farmers are informed i e 50 of the total number of farmers 2 only economicus farmers are informed i e 50 of the total number of farmers 3 all farmers are informed 4 50 of randomly selected farmers are informed 5 no information is provided to farmers see fig 4 when only eco friendly farmers are targeted for information dissemination more farmers change their farming practice than when only economicus farmers are targeted and when half of the farmers are randomly targeted even if they do not receive information there are more eco friendly farmers adopting low input practices when economicus farmers are informed than when no farmers are informed due to the diffusion of behaviour through the subjective norm this highlights the two drivers of the model an individual driver through the attitude ai t and a social driver through the subjective norm si t for the economicus farmers the diffusion through the subjective norm social driver has a higher impact than the effect of information on the attitude individual driver as seen when comparing the cases where economicus farmers are informed and where half of the farmers are informed the eco friendly farmers are more receptive to the information through the attitude individual driver than to the subjective norm social driver thus for the same share of 50 of farmers informed an information policy targeting the group of farmers with higher eps is more effective than no targeting for a constant cost of information dissemination targeting farmers according to their ep is more efficient however if the objective is to involve as many farmers as possible in the programme the most effective programme is the one where all farmers are affected by the information measure 4 1 3 policy effectiveness depends on farmers awareness threshold the environmental component of attitude depends on the information about the pollutant concentration in water we now consider the provision of information about the consequences of the pollution awareness raising measure that lowers the awareness threshold we suppose that an awareness raising measure may improve the effectiveness of the protection programme because it increases the environmental component of attitude and its effect is higher when combined with the provision of information about the pollutant concentration the concentration of pollutants can vary from 0 to 50 mg l a concentration of 50 mg l corresponds to the concentration where all farmers have high input practices and is the initial situation nevertheless without information the farmers perceive on average a concentration equal to 35 mg l the lower the awareness threshold the lower the final concentration of pollutants and the higher the final share of low input farmers three sets of awareness thresholds emerge considering only the awareness raising measure dotted lines in fig 5 set 1a awareness thresholds from 0 to 20 mg l whatever the thresholds the final share of low input farmers is high in this situation at t 0 the environmental component of attitude is equal to 1 in this range of initial thresholds an awareness raising measure does not have any effect on the final share of low input farmers and on the pollutant concentration therefore if the initial awareness threshold is low it is not necessary to invest in a policy measure targeting the awareness threshold set 2a awareness thresholds from 20 to 50 mg l the environmental component of attitude decreases from 1 to 0 and consequently the final share of low input farmers decreases set 3a awareness thresholds higher than 50 the environmental component for an awareness threshold of 50 and a perceived pollutant concentration of 35 initial and fixed perceived pollutant concentration in the case of no information about the pollutant concentration is approximately equal to 0 thus there is no difference between awareness thresholds higher than 50 they correspond to a significantly light involvement of farmers in this set an awareness raising measure has to set the threshold at least below 50 mg l in order to trigger an increase of final share of low input farmers with the two information measures combined information about concentration and awareness raising solid lines in fig 5 the final share of low input farmers is higher whatever the awareness threshold moreover there are still three sets of awareness thresholds nevertheless they have shifted set 1b awareness thresholds from 0 to 25 mg l the awareness raising measure has no effect the range of thresholds where the measure has no effect has been expanded compared to set 1a thus the information measure increases the threshold at which investing in an awareness measure has an effect on the final share of low input farmers set 2b awareness thresholds from 25 to 65 mg l an awareness raising measure has a greater impact when the awareness threshold is medium with or without information on pollutant concentrations nevertheless the set of awareness threshold where there is a high impact of the awareness raising measure has shifted and has been extended to 65 mg l thus the information about pollutant concentrations allows the awareness raising measure to have an impact on farmers with higher awareness thresholds set 3b awareness thresholds higher than 65 mg l the set where the awareness raising measure has to be important has shifted on the right thus the information measure about the pollutant concentration permits to improve the effect of awareness raising measure for farmers with a high awareness threshold finally the awareness raising measure has the greatest effect for a population with a medium sensitivity threshold moreover when the two measures are combined the information measure on the pollution level being the domain of low threshold populations for which there is no need to invest in the awareness measure and it improves its effect for populations with a high threshold grey intervals in fig 5 4 2 impact of the variation in the initial level of pollution the second set of simulations shows that the final share of low input farmers increases with the initial concentration of pollutants see fig 6 below a certain level of initial concentration the final share of low input farmers and the final concentration are the same then farmers involvement increases steadily with the initial concentration finally above a certain initial concentration the share of low input farmers is quite stable a high initial concentration leads to a higher involvement of farmers in the protection programme from the start of its implementation then other farmers are involved due to the subjective norm and even if the concentration decreases final concentration lower than initial concentration the subjective norm maintains the level of farmers involvement when the pollutant concentration is lower the farmers get involved later when the concentration increases for more details on the transition pathway of the share of low input farmers depending on the concentration for different initial concentrations see in appendix 5 an example for a low initial concentration 0 mg l a medium initial concentration 34 mg l and a high initial concentration 50 mg l 4 3 influence of heterogeneity in farmers environmental preferences on the impact of information measures 4 3 1 influence of different combinations of eps uniform population versus highly heterogeneous population we test different combinations of values of eps for the two groups of the population with eps w1 w2 varying between 0 and 1 fig 7 a displays the final share of low input farmers depending on w1 and w2 and fig 7b shows different sections of 7a for both groups the environmental component is higher than the financial component see section 4 1 1 therefore the higher are the eps the higher is the final share of low input farmers first let us analyse the results in the case of a uniform population where the eps of the groups are equal i e all farmers have the same ep w1 w2 this corresponds to the dashed lines cross section b in fig 7a and 7b for a uniform population the higher are the eps the higher is the final share of low input farmers in this section the eps are the same and equal the average of eps i e a w1 w2 2 second we consider the case of an heterogeneous population we called the heterogeneity of the population the difference in eps between the groups i e the higher is the difference the more heterogeneous is the population the heterogeneous population is the population with the higest heterogeneity for this purpose we fix an ep to one population 0 or 1 and we vary the ep of the second population from 0 to 1 leading to a ep difference between 0 uniform population and 1 highest heterogeneous population it corresponds to the purple solid lines in fig 7a i e the first part of the curve is if a є 0 0 5 w1 2 a and w2 0 cross section a1 and the second part is if a є 0 5 1 w1 1 and w2 2 a 1 cross section a2 the average of eps increases along these lines for the heterogeneous population the results are the same than the uniform population the higher the eps the higher the final share of low input farmers therefore for both types of populations the increase of eps has a similar effect third we now compare the results with both populations according to the average of eps the average of eps can vary from 0 to 1 we plotted the evolution of two types of populations in fig 7b in purple a dashed line for the uniform population w1 w2 and a solid line for the heterogeneous population this latter corresponds to the two cross sections of a1 and a2 from fig 7a as expected the final share of low input farmers increases with the average of eps the final share of low input farmers is higher with the heterogeneous population when the average of eps is low and is higher with the uniform population when the average of eps is high 4 3 2 individual and social drivers of the influence of heterogeneity in farmers environmental preferences let us analyse the results in the case of a fixed average population where the average eps of groups is fixed i e w1 w2 2 a for example a population with a fixed average of 0 5 thus w1 1 w2 and a population with a fixed average of 0 25 thus w1 0 5 w2 correspond to the dotted lines in fig 7a and 7b cross section c and d respectively for these two cases the final share of low input farmers for a population with a fixed average of eps depends on the difference between the eps of the groups for the population with a fixed average of 0 5 cross section c in fig 7 the closer are the eps i e at the centre of the figure the higher is the final share of low input farmers by contrast the further are the eps i e the more heterogeneous is the population the lower is the final share of low input farmers the opposite holds true for the population with a fixed average of 0 25 cross section d in fig 7 the c and d sections highlight that the effect of the heterogeneity of the groups depends on the average of eps and underline the two drivers of the model first the individual driver acting through the environmental component of attitude has a different weight depending on the farmers groups eps second the social driver acting through the subjective norm sn has the same weight for all farmers when the fixed ep average is equal to 0 5 the driver leading to more changes in low input farming is the individual driver when the fixed ep average is equal to 0 25 the driver leading to more changes in low input farming is the social driver the threshold above which the individual driver becomes more important than the social driver is the intersection between the two types of populations in fig 7b above this point it means that the individual driver is sufficient on average to encourage farmers to change their practices below this point the individual driver is not sufficient and the social driver becomes more important 5 discussion and conclusions 5 1 contributions and policy implications water pollution is a major environmental concern and improving water quality is one of the main management goals at both national and supra national scales our study explored the role of information measures in programmes designed to protect water quality in the literature the role of information has been explored through the analysis of social learning processes e g shaijumon and james 2018 benyishay and mobarak 2019 baggio and hillis 2019 the study of the imitation strategies e g efferson et al 2007 baggio et al 2018 rebaudo and dangles 2015 or the assessment of expected value e g davis et al 2019 previous research has also focused on the water resource e g kaiser et al 2020 nevertheless to our best knowledge no study has dealt with information in the specific context of water quality managment moreover although the literature recognises that information based policies are of interest in the context of environmental policies e g blackstock et al 2010 ervin ervin 1982 prokopy et al 2008 the decision making mechanisms involved are not yet well understood the first contribution of this paper is therefore to formalise the role of information about the ecological system in farmers decision making processes our results showed that the involvement of farmers in protection programmes depends on the information given about water pollution and about the consequences of this pollution in addition the difference between environmental preferences in the farmers population affects the diffusion of low input farming practices the higher are the farmers environmental preferences on average the more farmers will adopt practices favourable to water quality heterogeneity in farmers preferences is a factor fostering the adoption of eco friendly practices when the average preference is sufficiently low whereas it hinders adoption when the average preference is high thus the difference in environmental preferences between farmers has to be taken into account in the choice of public policies this is in line with the study by garforth et al 2003 who found that an important point in the provision of information and advice is to recognise the diversity of the motivations of land managers it is important to recognise the heterogeneity of those managing land water relationships and to tailor advice to the different farming contexts and cultures finally different initial concentrations are also a determinant of the involvement of farmers farmers participation increases with the initial pollution level nevertheless these conclusions are to be interpreted in light of two caveats first we suppose that there is no irreversibility in the water quality problems second the time during which the policy is not implemented and during which the concentration of pollutants increases could have negative consequences such as an increase in the cost of depolluting to produce drinking water or an increase in health related costs the second contribution of this article is methodological our model is an illustration of an agent based complex system described by an et al 2021 using the concept of an information instrument and its impact on the decision making process the operationalisation and implementation in a mathematical model of this concept contribute to the debates on the definition of it and use the role of information has already been studied in models using the tpb but only with regard to the financial motivation of behaviour muelder and filatova 2018 verwaart and valeeva 2011 and to the best of our knowledge it has not been implemented in the context of an environmental factor more specifically in terms of implementation our work contributes toward integrating ecological dimensions in the conceptualisation of the attitude factor of the tpb coupled with the use of information we propose a formalisation of the environmental component of attitude using an awareness threshold and the state of the water body this differs from the modelling of environmental attitudes in previous studies such as the use of the co2 emission saving of solar panels muelder and filatova 2008 environmental friendliness of energy conservation behaviours raihanian mashadi and behdad 2018 or the environmental productivity of a farming practice xu et al 2018 5 2 limitations and perspectives we formalised the role of information in farmers decision making process through a dynamical model we identify five avenues for future work concerning the heterogeneity of farmers the environmental component of attitude the change in environmental preferences the network dynamics and the possibility to return to high input farming practices first we considered only two homogeneous groups of farmers with different environmental preferences nevertheless we may explore the influence of having more groups or including variations in the groups for example broch and vedel 2012 using a survey analysed the heterogeneity in farmers preferences for agri environmental schemes and identified four groups with divergent preferences regarding their willingness to accept compensation and to engage in groundwater and biodiversity protection second the conceptualisation of the environmental component of attitude could be improved the influence of the concentration of pollutants is the same during the simulation nevertheless the variation in concentration could be linked with the behaviour of the farmer or of the farmer s network for example if the farmer sees as a consequence of the changes in practices in her network a decrease in the pollution level he or she is more likely to change their behaviour than if they see no change indeed slower changes in water quality may result in farmers being less motivated to adopt low input practices okumah et al 2021 additionally the process could be moderated as a function of the trust in public authorities the trust in public authorities has been shown to have a positive effect on the participation in agri environmental schemes arnaud et al 2007 lastra bravo et al 2015 third a process of change in environmental preferences could be considered the information about the consequences of water pollution could also change farmers environmental preferences in addition to changes in the awareness threshold in this case the provision of information will have consequences not only on the behaviour of the farmers but also on their decision making process with a longer term change fourth the conceptualisation of the social component can be improved both by including dynamics of the social network or by adding other cognitive and affective processes the social network might evolve in time according to farmers choices and or their environmental preferences for instance this would create a feedback between the governance component the social component and the choices of farming practices moreover the social component correspond to a conformist network where the farmer has a tendency to follow the majority we could further integrate a tendency to imitate success e g effersion et al 2007 or to be mavericks e g efferson et al 2008 finally we did not include in our model the possibility to revert to the original farming practices after a few years of entering the protection programme however in europe the agri environmental contracts end after 5 years and the farmers are free of any contractual commitment concerning their land management choice they can therefore revert to their previous practices the introduction of a reversion process could be interesting in order to highlight the influence of economic and information instruments on the longer term for example khufuss et al 2016 show that information about what other farmers intend to do can greatly influence a farmer s decision in maintaining the practices after the end of agri environmental contracts 5 3 concluding remarks we investigated the role of information measures in the change in farming practices and thus their impact on water pollution the extension of an agent based model of a drinking catchment area allowed us to explore the impact of the information about pollution and the consequences of pollution the effect of the diversity of environmental preferences among farmers and the influence of the initial level of pollution our contributions are methodological and theoretical first the implementation of information in an agent based model and the description of the environmental attitude contribute to debates on the use of these concepts in computer models second we highlighted that targeting farmers who have higher environmental preferences is more effective than no targeting when half of the population can be subject to the information campaign moreover when this measure is combined with the awareness raising measure once a certain threshold of public awareness is reached there is a synergy between them furthermore the heterogeneity between farmers in terms of environmental preferences has an influence on the involvement of farmers in the programme depending on the average environmental concern finally under certain conditions in terms of information and population characteristics the higher is the initial pollution the higher is the involvement of farmers in the environmental programme credit authorship contribution statement amélie bourceret methodology software formal analysis writing original draft laurence

study to explore how the choice by farmers with either financial or environmental orientation who are connected in a network for whether or not to join a protection programme and thus to practice low input farming the farming practice promoting by protection program and the consequences in terms of drinking water quality are influenced on the one hand by different behavioural specifications and on the other hand by different characteristics of a protection programme i ii b for whom is the model designed for scientists of different disciplinary backgrounds particularly those interested in natural resource governance i ii entities state variables and scales i ii a what kinds of entities are in the model one ecological entity a groundwater with a certain concentration of nitrate two types of social entities farmers and governance dozens of agents represent farmers whose farming practices have the unintended consequence of releasing pollutants into groundwater they decide to enter

background ii i a which general concepts theories or hypotheses are underlying the model s design at the system level or at the level s of the submodel s apart from the decision model what is the link to complexity and the purpose of the model the ecological submodel is a linear reservoir model whose storage law and discharge law vary linearly as a function of the water level the linear reservoir model in its simplest form appears well adapted to quite variable situations ranging from small highly urbanized watersheds to watersheds of several hundred hectares ministère de la transition écologique et solidaire 2020 the governance submodel is a choice of a protection programme that can include the following measures information measure about the pollution level and awareness raising measure financial compensation individual training and technical support fixed measures the choice is about the farmers targeted by the measures and about the level of the awareness threshold financial compensation they are based on agri environmental scheme that are eu common agricultural policy s instruments farmers voluntary commit to adopt low input farming practices in return for a financial compensation this compensation aims at covering the costs and income losses resulting from the change as well as transaction costs it influences the economic profits associated with a farming practice hence the economic component of the attitude the compensation is provided annually for five years training technical support and awareness raising are individual support measures to farmers in their changes of practices e g technical advice meetings technical tests experiments according to paineau et al 1998 and lastra bravo et al 2015 training and information for farmers are key elements that promote a greater respect for the environment in the model this measure affects the perceived control by increasing farmers knowledge about a farming practice knowledge persists in time information measure about the pollution level the information given to the farmers is the monitored concentration of pollutants in the water body this information measure can target all farmers or a certain share of farmers depending on the intensity of information diffusion when a farmer is concerned by the information measure she receives information about the pollutant concentration at each time step one year the information modifies ci t in the calculation of the environmental component of attitude eq 4 awareness raising measure the objective is to lower the awareness threshold of farmers therefore the information will modify α in the calculation of the environmental component of attitude eq 3 the modification of the awareness threshold for a farmer is permanent ii i b on what assumptions is are the agents decision model s based we adapt the theory of planned behaviour tpb ajzen 1991 in this framework the intention towards a behaviour considered as a trustworthy predictor as whether or not the behaviour will be performed is influenced by three global variables judgment about the desirability of the behaviour and its consequences attitude towards behaviour considerations about the influence and opinions of others on that behaviour subjective norm and beliefs about the individual s ability to succeed in the behaviour perceived behavioural control the attitude comprises two components a financial component and an environmental component eqs 3 and 4 ii i c why is a are certain decision model s chosen one of the most frequently used approach to understand farmers decision making with regard to agri environmental policies is the theory of reasoned action developed by ajzen and fishbein ajzen and fishbein 1980 toma and mathijs 2007 falconer 2000 who was later extended to the tpb ajzen 1991 ii i d if the model a submodel e g the decision model is based on empirical data where does the data come from ii i e at which level of aggregation were the data available ii ii individual decision making ii ii a what are the subjects and objects of decision making on which level of aggregation is decision making modeled are multiple levels of decision making included farmers decide if there are involved in the protection programme and accordingly apply low input farming practice governance give information about the pollution level and about the negative consequences of water pollution on health economy and biodiversity and target some farmers for its measures ii ii b what is the basic rationality behind agents decision making in the model do agents pursue an explicit objective or have other success criteria farmers act if their intention exceeds a threshold this intention is a function of their beliefs about the behaviour in term of attitude subjective norm and perceived behavioural control ii ii c how do agents make their decisions if the farmer is not in the protection programme and thus do not practice low input farming she compares her intention to be involved in the programme ii t and her behavioural threshold ωi if the behavioural threshold is exceeded she enters in the programme and change to low input farming 1 calculation of intentions ii t which is a linear function of the following factors weighted γa γs γp by their contribution in the intention attitude ai weighted sum of a comparison between profit and environmental component subjective norm si t percentage of low input farmers in networks perceived behavioural control p knowledge and past experiences2 compare intentions with behavioural threshold ωi attributes of farmers concerning the decision making process are a weight of the importance of attitude in intention a weight of the importance of perceived behavioural control in intention and a weight of the importance of subjective norm in intention a weight of the importance of the financial component of the attitude a weight of the importance of the environmental component of the attitude behavioural threshold it indicates when the intention becomes a behaviour ii ii d do the agents adapt their behavior to changing endogenous and exogenous state variables and if yes how yes attitude is modifying by the information given in the protection programme ii ii e do social norms or cultural values play a role in the decision making process yes a social norm represented by the percentage of low input farmers in an agent s network constitutes the subjective norm ii ii f do spatial aspects play a role in the decision process no ii ii g do temporal aspects play a role in

change the expected profit of farming practices and expected control ii v b what internal models are agents assumed to use to estimate future conditions or consequences of their decisions farmers attitude is the judgement about the desirability of their behaviour and consequences this attitude is divided in a financial and an environmental component the financial component of the attitude use the expected income from the farming practice and the environmental component use the output effect of farming practice on watershed ii v c might agents be erroneous in the prediction process and how is it implemented no they are not erroneous for the financial component they calculate the difference normalized between the expected income of actual farming practice and the other farming practive the environmental component is the judgement of farmer i on the environmental desirability of changing to low input farming practices it depends on the perception of the concentration of pollutants c i t and on an individual awareness threshold α if farmers perceive a good water quality they judge that there is no environmental desirability for them to change to low input farming practices the perception of a high concentration of pollutants implies a belief in the importance of changing practices that contribute to increasing the environmental component of the attitude ii vi interaction ii

2 we presented the effect of initial concentrations on the final share of low input farmers to go further we analysed the transition pathway of the share of low input farmers depending on the concentration for different initial concentrations we chose three initial concentrations with different effects to illustrate our analysis see fig a 5 1 a low initial concentration 0 mg l 2 a medium initial concentration 34 mg l 3 a high initial concentration 50 mg l we compare the pathway with the equilibrium states depending on fixed shares of low input farmers these equilibrium states correspond to the balance between the quantity of pollutant exiting the water body and the quantity of pollutant entering through the high input practices of farmers dashed lines in fig a 5 1 in the first case there is a low initial pollution since at the beginning of the simulation all farmers practice high input agriculture the concentration will naturally increase and even if there are some low input farmers thanks to the protection programme as long as the share of low input farmers remains low i e below the equilibrium states dashed line in fig a 5 the concentration of pollutants increases despite the increase in the share of low input farmers close to the equilibrium states there is a slight decrease in the concentration 2 when the initial concentration is medium first the concentration of pollutants increases despite the increase in the share of low input farmers and then it decreases indeed while the quantity of pollutants entering the system is higher than the quantity exiting the concentration increases it corresponds to a concentration lower than the concentration at the equilibrium state for the same share of low input farmers after a few steps when the concentration is higher than the equilibrium the concentration of pollutants decreases until reaching equilibrium this is due to the time it takes for the grounwater body to react 3 the last case represents the cases where the concentration decreases during the entire simulation in this simulation the initial concentration is higher than the concentration of pollutants entering the system at each further step the concentration in water is still higher than the concentration entering until the equilibrium thus the concentration decreases with the share of low input farming 
24243,diverse public policies encourage farmers to adopt eco friendly practices to address the issue of diffuse pollution from agriculture including measures based on the provision of information on the environment indeed farmers perception of the state of the water body and their awareness of the causes and consequences of water pollution affect their willingness to adopt eco friendly farming practices public policies therefore have a role to play in disseminating environmental information in this article we investigate how information measures may exert influence on changes in farming practices and thereby water pollution we extend an existing agent based model of a social ecological system representing a drinking water catchment area in the decision making process based on the theory of planned behaviour we integrate a dynamical environmental component of farmers attitude towards eco friendly practices in order to take into account the effect of information on the ecological system we explore the impact of information measures heterogeneity in farmers environmental preferences and variations in the initial level of water pollution on farmers participation to a water catchment protection programme our results show that 1 targeting farmers who have higher environmental preferences is more effective than no targeting 2 the heterogeneity in farmers environmental preferences impacts their involvement in the programme depending on the average environmental preferences 3 the higher the initial pollution the higher the farmers are involved in the protection programme 4 when two different measures are combined once a certain threshold of public awareness is reached there is a synergy between them keywords agent based model governance information social ecological system theory of planned behaviour water quality data availability i have shared the link to my code in the manuscript 1 introduction the world s freshwater resources face different sources of pollution organic waste pathogens fertilizers and pesticides heavy metals or emerging pollutants un water 2020 these pollutions lead to a degradation of water quality with various economic social and environmental consequences fao 2011 more specifically in the case of the production of drinking water restoring and protecting water quality is an important issue due to the impact of pollution on health and the increased production costs for providing drinking water bommelear et al 2011 water quality refers to the chemical physical and biological dimensions of water based on the standards of its usage in europe for instance the european union drinking water directive set the legal framework to protect human health from the adverse effects of any contamination of water intended for human consumption by ensuring that it is wholesome and clean it defines and values a set of bacteriological physico chemical and radiological parameters european parliament and council 2020 because farming practices are one of the major sources of diffuse pollution in drinking water catchment areas understanding farmers motivations to adopt eco friendly practices may provide new insights for designing efficient policies among the various factors that influence farmers choices regarding agricultural practices promoted by environmental policies see for instance dessart et al 2019 their perception of water quality i e the subjective evaluation of water quality is an important one amblard 2019 bosc and doussan 2009 gachango et al 2015 lubell et al 2002 moser 1984 michel guillou 2009 for example gachango et al 2015 found that in specific areas in denmark farmers perceive the water quality to be above average the effective water quality and consequently they feel that the removal of the regulatory measures would have little or no effect in terms of reducing the water quality the decision making process of farmers was also shown to be influenced by their awareness of the consequences of water pollution michel guillou and moser 2006 their awareness of the consequences of their farming practices hu and morton 2011 or their environmental concern i e their interest in water quality and sense of responsibility towards the environment toma and mathijs 2007 recent studies show that farmers do not behave in favour of water quality due to a lack of information perspective and understanding of the benefits of eco friendly behaviours popp and rodrigez 2007 floress et al 2017 inman et al 2018 okumah et al 2018 thus public policies have a major role to play in disseminating information on water quality and on the consequences of water pollution indeed information measures may improve the effect of financial or regulatory instruments sheeder lynne 2011 barnes et al 2013 kuhfuss et al 2016 land managers such as farmers are different in terms of their constraints to change the factors that motivate their decisions or in how they balance business social and personal factors liu et al 2018 dessart et al 2019 this diversity means that different types of information may be required at different times with differing degrees of advice and prescription for environmental policies garforth et al 2003 thus recognising the diversity of farming styles related to management decisions is essential in supporting the integrated management of diffuse agricultural pollution for addressing such issues we extended an agent based model of a drinking water catchment area bourceret et al 2022 the conceptual framework of the model is based on the social ecological systems ses framework ostrom 2009 mcginnis and ostrom 2014 the ses framework was developed from the institutional analysis and development iad approach ostrom 2011 for analysing the governance of common pool resources ostrom 2007 2009 it is now being used more widely including for the analysis of the various public goods and services generated by sess mcginnis and ostrom 2014 ban et al 2015 bennett and gosnell 2015 the model represents a water catchment area where farmers decide on their farming practices which impact water quality the decision making process of farmers is based on the theory of planned behaviour and takes into account social influences as well as the heterogeneity of farmers we integrate the influence of the perception of water quality in farmers motivations through a dynamical environmental component of the attitude towards eco friendly practices the main purpose of the model is to perform a dynamical analysis of the adoption of low input farming practices we use this model to simulate behavioural reactions of farmers who are sensitive to the quality of the water to policy interventions in section 2 we present an overview of the impact of information policies on water pollution before describing the agent based model of a water catchment area in section 3 this model allows us to analyse the impact of information related instruments on water quality section 4 first we characterise the effectiveness of different water quality protection programmes we focus on the role of two types of information measures one measure based on the provision of information about the concentration of pollutants in water and a second measure including additionally the provision of information about the consequences of the pollution section 4 1 second we assess the impact of the state of the water body here a groundwater body on farmers decisions more particularly we analyse the impact of the initial concentration of pollutants in water on farmers behaviour section 4 2 third we characterise how the diversity amongst farmers affects policy effectiveness with a focus on the heterogeneity in environmental preferences section 4 3 finally we discuss our findings and results in section 5 2 overview of the impact of information based policies on water pollution first we present how information based policy instruments may complement regulatory and financial instruments in the context of water quality management then we discuss how the water quality and awareness of water quality issues influence the decision making process of farmers with regard to the adoption of eco friendly practices 2 1 information instruments for enhancing water quality environmental policy instruments include a diversity of instruments such as economic command and control and information instruments villamayor et al 2019 economic instruments rely on market forces and changes in relative prices to modify the behaviour of actors in a way that supports environmental protection or improvement command and control tools influence environmental outcomes by regulating processes or products limiting the discharge of specified pollutants and by restricting some polluting activities to specific times or areas although these instruments have demonstrated their effectiveness for managing environmental problems they have shown some limitations in the case of agricultural nonpoint source water pollution shortle et al 2012 for instance economic incentives alone do not account for changes in farming practice that improve water quality because of a dual self and others interests czap et al 2012 sheeder lynne 2011 barnes et al 2013 highlight a vicious circle of regulation of water pollution coercive behaviour due to regulation creates a negative perception of water pollution issues and ultimately leads to a greater need for regulation information instruments imply a voluntary commitment of farmers to adopt practices in favour of water quality they include public education and information campaigns the concept of nudge developed in behavioural economics refers to the provision of information that influences the decision making of individuals without changing the structure of economic incentives or restricting their available options for example kuhfuss et al 2016 found a positive effect of information on a social norm as a behavioural nudge on the maintenance of practices promoted by agri environmental schemes the information may be used in a complementary way to enhance the effect of an economic instrument barnes et al 2013 also found that nudges play a positive role in the implementation of regulatory policies targeting water quality an optimal mix of policies can lead to positive effects on water quality villamayor et al 2019 highlighted that information based policies can be based on either 1 providing information in a relatively neutral way or 2 providing an appropriate interpretation of the information to guide behaviour in a particular direction for example the authority in charge of water management can monitor the concentration of pollutants in water and inform farmers about it an alternative action is to provide information about the consequences of this pollution in order to raise awareness according to lastra bravo et al 2015 and okumah et al 2021 training awareness raising and information for farmers are key elements that promote eco friendly practices awareness raising of the environmental consequences of farming is generally considered a necessary step towards the adoption of practices that improve water quality blackstock et al 2010 ervin ervin 1982 prokopy et al 2008 blackstock et al 2010 based on a literature review highlighted that raising awareness amongst farmers can alone be effective in persuading farmers to adopt favourable water practices the information provided to improve water quality can concern different aspects such as the behaviour of others the environmental consequences of farming or the level of degradation of the resource we focus particularly on the information on the water resource 2 2 influence of water quality on the decision making process in the adoption of farming practices promoted by environmental policies in the field of drinking water management the level of water contamination by nitrates and or pesticides was found to play an important role in stakeholders incentives to cooperate in the protection of drinking water catchments lubell et al 2002 bosc and doussan 2009 several studies have shown how the threat of applying regulatory measures when the level of pollution is high may stimulate the involvement of agricultural stakeholders in collective action to protect water catchments and watersheds hardy and koontz 2010 grolleau and mccann 2012 amblard 2019 by contrast some studies have noted that the good quality of the water resource i e the absence of water pollution can constitute an impediment to agricultural stakeholders involvement garin and barraqué 2012 amblard 2019 the good quality of the water resource appears to be an obstacle to the participation of farmers who question the legitimacy of undertaking costly changes in their farming practices in the absence of any observed pollution amblard 2019 moreover the concern of farmers for the environment impacts their adoption of sustainable practices toma and mathijs 2007 best 2010 jaeck and lifran 2014 d souza et al 1993 found that farmers who are aware of on farm environmental issues are more likely to implement sustainable practices floress et al 2017 found a positive relationship between awareness of water quality problems and farmers willingness to adopt actions to improve water quality in indiana identically michel guillou and moser 2006 showed that farmers who have adopted pro environmental practices feel more involved in this problem than farmers who have maintained traditional practices indeed while some farmers may recognise the impact of agricultural practices on water quality e g ward et al 1995 hu and morton 2011 other farmers may not be aware of these consequences e g popp and rodrigez 2007 moreover some farmers may have a negative opinion of the environmental benefits of water management e g barnes et al 2009 morton et al 2017 inman et al 2018 this brief review highlights the importance of information based instruments in environmental management which constitutes the main motivation for our modelling approach we focus on information about the state of the water body and therefore we developed a model involving actors whose decision making process partially depends on the state of the water body in a context where a mix of policies includes information instruments 3 a social ecological model integrating the impact of information based instruments we extend an agent based model of a social ecological system ses from a previous study bourceret et al 2022 this model representing a water catchment area uses the theory of planned behaviour tpb this theory has been frequently applied for predicting human behaviour more particularly to understand farmers behaviour in a voluntary policy context sok et al 2020 first we present the core elements of the model previously developed section 3 1 second we present the adaptations made to the model to analyse the effect of an information policy on farming practices section 3 2 see appendix 1 for the overview design concepts and details odd protocol description the code is available here https github com abourceret behaviouraldynamicsinses git modeleinformationinstruments nlogo 3 1 existing tpb based model of a drinking water catchment as a ses in the existing model bourceret et al 2022 individual farmers are connected in a social network and their decision of whether or not to join a catchment protection programme and thus to practice low input farming promoted by the programme is based on the tpb ajzen 1991 each farmer has an intention to change to low input practices i e a level of motivation to adopt a low input practice based on three independent factors the attitude subjective norm and perceived behavioural control following different studies defrancesco et al 2007 mettepenningen et al 2013 falconer 2000 we described the attitude as the financial and environmental judgement about the desirability of adopting the low input farming practice the considerations about the influence and opinions of others on the behaviour of interest define the subjective norm ajzen 1991 farmers decisions are influenced by the practices of farmers belonging to their social network the perceived behavioural control is the aggregation of past experiences knowledge and qualification ajzen 1991 farmers with an intention higher than a personal threshold will change to low input farming 3 1 1 water body the water used for drinking water production is extracted from a water body the water body sub model is a linear reservoir model whose storage law and discharge law vary linearly as a function of the water level we consider that the quantities of water feeding and leaving natural flow and extracted water the water body system are equal and constant over time the concentration of pollutants in water c t in mg l is used as a proxy to measure water quality we assume that diffuse pollution from agricultural activities is the only source of water body pollution and that only high input farming practices lead to residual pollutants in the water body 3 1 2 actors 3 1 2 1 decision process the intention to change to low input farming practices i i t is a linear function of the three basic factors 1 i i t s i t a i t p where s i t is the subjective norm linked to the behaviour of others a i t is the attitude i e the judgement of farmer i on the desirability of changing to low input farming practices and on the consequences of this change p is the perceived control of behaviour representing the beliefs of the farmer on his or her ability to adopt the low input farming practice depending on the level of ii t and on a behavioural threshold the farmer will choose whether or not to change their farming practices bi t 2 i f i i t ω i t h e n b i t 1 l the value of the behavioural threshold ωi is distributed among the population according to a normal law thus it is different for each simulation this distribution is chosen to represent the diversity among individuals and the fact that the intention although relatively good at predicting behaviour is not a perfect predictor 3 1 2 2 factors 3 1 2 2 1 subjective norm the subjective norm is the agent s perception of what the other people who are important to the agent the farmers in the network of the agent think the agent should or should not do each farmer has its own network farmers in a network can communicate about their farming practices we assume that what the farmer believes that the other important people think the agent should or should not do is equivalent to what the other important people do thus the subjective norm is equal to the share of low input farmers in the network of the farmer this factor is dynamic and evolves during the simulation dotted line in fig 1 we represent the farmer s network as partly based on spatial criteria of proximity folowing the literature and partly random e g schmidtner et al 2012 läpple and kelley 2015 we used the algorithm of the small worlds model developed in netlogo by wilensky 2015 we set the parameters to fit our case in terms of number and characteristics of initial connections and rewiring probability see appendix 2 for the clustering coefficient and the average shortest path length farmers are initially located randomly on a lattice for each simulation at the initialization of the network of the farmers network each farmer is connected to his neighbors located on nearby plots xi 1 yi 1 i e maximum eight neighbours then each connection has a 50 probability of being rewired to another random farmer the farmers with whom the farmer is connected represent its network therefore a farmer s network is on average composed for half of farmers in his neighborhood xi 6 1 yi 1 nd for half by randomly located farmers 3 1 2 2 2 perceived behavioural control the perceived behavioural control is the perception of the ease and difficulty of performing the behaviour this factor is static and the same for all farmers in the model we represent the perceived behavioural control as the initial aggregation of past experiences knowledge and qualification and new knowledge acquired with the protection programme we assume that the initial perceived behavioural control is zero and the same for all farmers 3 1 2 2 3 attitude the attitude ai t comprises two components a financial component f and an environmental component ei t 3 3 a i t e i t w i f 1 w i 4 f π l π h φ π h π l the financial attitude towards the protection programme and its implementation f is the difference between the low input farming and high input farming gross margins normalized 4 the costs of change can be a barrier to the intention of changing farming practices π h and π l are respectively the gross margin of the high input farming practice and of the low input farming practice compensation φ can be provided to farmers depending on the protection programme e i t is the environmental component of the attitude i e the perception of the concentration of pollutants and the awareness of the consequences of the farming practices and of pollution its calculation is described in section 3 2 following several authors we use the term preference to describe the relative weight of the components of the attitude and more specifically environmental preference to describe the relative weight of the environmental component of the attitude w i e g verwaart et al 2011 robinson and ray 2015 muelder and filatova 2018 3 2 integrating a dynamical environmental component of the attitude and information measures 3 2 1 environmental component of the attitude based on the existing model we developed the conceptual foundations for explaining the attitude of agents towards the environment e i t the purpose of the proposed agent based model is to explore how the choice by farmers who are connected in a network to join a protection programme and thus to practice low input farming promoted by the programme see fig 1 is influenced by the environmental component of the attitude the agent based model is implemented in netlogo version 6 0 3 wilensky 1999 all parameters value ranges and sources of values can be found in appendix 3 e i t is the environmental component of the attitude a i which is the judgement of farmer i on the desirability of changing to low input farming practices thus e i t is the judgement of farmer i on the environmental desirability of changing to low input farming practices the environmental component of the attitude depends on three parameters 1 the perception of the concentration of pollutants c i t 2 an individual awareness threshold α 3 a sensitivity to this awareness threshold q following mathias et al 2020 we chose a function based on a sigmoid shape s shaped if farmers perceive a good water quality they judge that there is no environmental desirability for them to change to low input farming practices the perception of a high concentration of pollutants implies a belief in the importance of changing practices that contribute to increasing the environmental component of the attitude 5 e i t c i t q c i t q α q α is the awareness threshold for a favourable attitude and it corresponds to the environmental attitude inflection point see fig 2 around this awareness threshold the environmental attitude increases quickly if ci t α e i t 0 5 q is the degree of sensitivity to change in the environmental attitude if q is high then the farmer will have a rapid change in environmental attitude and if q is low then the change in environmental attitude will be more gradual we set q 5 which implies a relatively high rate of environmental attitude change note that other high values of q yielding sudden perception change will not change the results qualitatively c i t can be informed by the authority in charge of water quality management or can be the belief of the farmers if they do not have any information about the pollution level if the farmer receives the information about the concentration of pollutants in the water then ci t c t this information received depends on a parameter of the system of governance see below if the farmer receives no information about the concentration of pollutants in the water then ci t ci we assumed that on average farmers in our model at the initialisation of the model if they do not have information about the concentration of the water perceive the concentration of pollutants in the water to be lower than in reality indeed we followed gachango et al 2015 who found in their study that farmers on average perceive the water quality to be above the effective water quality ci t 0 c t 0 the belief is distributed at the initialisation of the model and is different for each simulation the belief regarding the concentration is distributed among the population according to a normal law and is stable during the simulation 3 2 2 information measures a protection programme aiming at protecting the drinking water catchment is implemented the farmer may or may not choose to participate in the programme if the farmers enter the programme they must change their farming practices to low input farming the protection programme is based on a combination of the following measures financial compensation training and information the duration of the programme is 5 years the financial compensation and training measures are fixed for all simulations they are considered as fixed parameters in the programme in order to study the impact of information based measures the financial compensation and the training influence the calculation of the financial component of attitude and the perceived behavioural control more details about the specific results on bourceret et al 2022 financial compensation fixed measure in what follows this measure is based on agri environmental schemes of the common agricultural policy cap of the european union farmers voluntarily commit to adopting eco friendly farming practices in return for financial compensation this compensation aims at covering the costs and income losses resulting from the change as well as transaction costs it influences the economic profits associated with a farming practice hence the financial aspect of the attitude the compensation is annual for 5 years in the following analysis we fixed the amount of compensation φ at 300 year which covers exactly the difference between the gross margins of low input and high input farming practices πh and πl this implies that the financial component of the attitude is equal to zero training fixed measure in what follows technical support and individual training are individual support measures to farmers when they change their practices e g technical advice meetings technical tests experiments in the model this measure affects the perceived control by increasing farmers knowledge about a farming practice knowledge persists in time in the following analysis the training intensity θ is fixed at 0 75 we focus on two information measures that influence the environmental component of attitude information measure about the pollution level the information given to the farmers is the monitored concentration of pollutants in the water body this measure can target all farmers or a certain share of farmers depending on the intensity of information diffusion m when a farmer is concerned by the information measure she receives information about the pollutant concentration at each time step one year the information modifies ci t in the calculation of the environmental component of attitude eq 4 information measure about the negative consequences of water pollution on health economy and biodiversity termed awareness raising measure in what follows the objective is to lower the awareness threshold of farmers therefore the information will modify α in the calculation of the environmental component of attitude eq 4 the modification of the awareness threshold for a farmer is permanent 3 3 simulations the impact of information measures on farmers behaviour and thus on water quality was explored by realizing three sets of simulations see table 1 for the parameters of simulations all simulations were performed 1000 times to give representative results on average see appendix 4 for standard deviations of the results in the first and second sets of simulations we explored the effect of the information measures in the context of two specific groups of farmers gathering 50 of farmers with similar environmental preferences ep within each group the eco friendly and economicus groups the eco friendly farmers place more emphasis on the environment than do the economicus farmers who attach more importance to economic profits hence the ep for the eco friendly farmers w i 0 5 is higher than the ep for the economicus farmers w i 0 1 in the first set of simulations we analysed the impact of both information based measures on the evolution of farmers practices by considering the eco friendly and economicus groups of farmers first we tested the impact of the information measure about the level of pollution on the evolution of low input practices and on the concentration of pollutants in water then we analysed the effect of targeting farmers according to their eps finally we tested the effect of the combined measures of providing information about the pollution level and information about the consequences of pollution awareness raising measure in this first set of simulations we assume that the initial concentration of pollutants corresponds to a stationary state before the implementation of the protection programme all farmers initially practice high input agriculture and consequently the initial concentration of pollutants in water is equal to 50 mg l however we suppose that the initial concentration may change the intention of farmers to practice low input farming in order to analyse how this influences policy effectiveness we tested the effect of different initial concentrations of pollutants in the water in a second set of simulations to simplify the analysis we keep the assumption about the composition of the populationt half of the farmers are eco friendly and half are economicus in a third set of simulations we consider a more general case with two groups of the same size whose eps may vary indeed in the first and second simulations we investigate the case of a moderate ep for the eco friendly farmers and a low ep for the economicus farmers we now consider the general case where the population is still split into two equal sized groups and within each group all individuals exhibit the same ep denoted w1 for farmers of group 1 and w2 for farmers of group 2 we expect that different ep combinations between groups may lead to changes in the effectiveness of the information measure about the level of pollution targeting all farmers 4 results in this section we present the results of the simulations aimed at exploring how information measures and farmers eps influence water quality section 4 1 presents how information based measures impact the evolution of farmers practices and water pollution levels we then present the results obtained regarding the influence of the initial pollution level on policy effectiveness section 4 2 finally how the heterogeneity in farmers eps impacts the effectiveness of the information measures is detailed in section 4 3 4 1 information based measures enhance farmers participation in protection programmes 4 1 1 policy effectiveness depends on the share of farmers concerned by the information measure we assume that policy makers can choose the intensity of information dissemination e g the amount of money allocated to the information measure which translates in the model into the percentage of farmers affected by the information measure about the water pollution level the final share of low input farmers increases with the share of farmers targeted by the information measure approximately linearly from 29 to 40 see fig 3 the concentration of pollutants also follows a linear decrease in both eco friendly and economicus farmers groups the final share of low input farmers increases with the share of farmers affected by the information measure nevertheless whatever the informed farmers share the final share of low input eco friendly farmers is higher than the final share of low input economicus farmers that is because the subjective norm and the perceived behavioural control are the same for both groups and only the attitude which is different between groups is higher for eco friendly farmers due to a financial compensation set as the difference in profit between the two farming practices see section 3 2 3 the financial component of attitude is equal to zero consequently only the environmental component of attitude plays a role in the attitude which is higher for eco friendly farmers 4 1 2 targeting farmers according to their environmental preference in addition to choosing how many farmers are affected by the information measure on the concentration of pollutants policy makers can select which groups of farmers according to their ep will be targeted by the information measure indeed depending on how the information is disseminated it could affect different groups of farmers for example information can be disseminated through a cooperative that gathers the same type of farmer through an agricultural magazine read by a certain type of farmer or through a network to which only one type of farmer belongs e g the dephy network in france brings together farmers committed to a voluntary approach for reducing the use of pesticides thus likely to have higher eps lapierre et al 2018 we compared four different policies in relation to the targeting of farmers 1 only eco friendly farmers are informed i e 50 of the total number of farmers 2 only economicus farmers are informed i e 50 of the total number of farmers 3 all farmers are informed 4 50 of randomly selected farmers are informed 5 no information is provided to farmers see fig 4 when only eco friendly farmers are targeted for information dissemination more farmers change their farming practice than when only economicus farmers are targeted and when half of the farmers are randomly targeted even if they do not receive information there are more eco friendly farmers adopting low input practices when economicus farmers are informed than when no farmers are informed due to the diffusion of behaviour through the subjective norm this highlights the two drivers of the model an individual driver through the attitude ai t and a social driver through the subjective norm si t for the economicus farmers the diffusion through the subjective norm social driver has a higher impact than the effect of information on the attitude individual driver as seen when comparing the cases where economicus farmers are informed and where half of the farmers are informed the eco friendly farmers are more receptive to the information through the attitude individual driver than to the subjective norm social driver thus for the same share of 50 of farmers informed an information policy targeting the group of farmers with higher eps is more effective than no targeting for a constant cost of information dissemination targeting farmers according to their ep is more efficient however if the objective is to involve as many farmers as possible in the programme the most effective programme is the one where all farmers are affected by the information measure 4 1 3 policy effectiveness depends on farmers awareness threshold the environmental component of attitude depends on the information about the pollutant concentration in water we now consider the provision of information about the consequences of the pollution awareness raising measure that lowers the awareness threshold we suppose that an awareness raising measure may improve the effectiveness of the protection programme because it increases the environmental component of attitude and its effect is higher when combined with the provision of information about the pollutant concentration the concentration of pollutants can vary from 0 to 50 mg l a concentration of 50 mg l corresponds to the concentration where all farmers have high input practices and is the initial situation nevertheless without information the farmers perceive on average a concentration equal to 35 mg l the lower the awareness threshold the lower the final concentration of pollutants and the higher the final share of low input farmers three sets of awareness thresholds emerge considering only the awareness raising measure dotted lines in fig 5 set 1a awareness thresholds from 0 to 20 mg l whatever the thresholds the final share of low input farmers is high in this situation at t 0 the environmental component of attitude is equal to 1 in this range of initial thresholds an awareness raising measure does not have any effect on the final share of low input farmers and on the pollutant concentration therefore if the initial awareness threshold is low it is not necessary to invest in a policy measure targeting the awareness threshold set 2a awareness thresholds from 20 to 50 mg l the environmental component of attitude decreases from 1 to 0 and consequently the final share of low input farmers decreases set 3a awareness thresholds higher than 50 the environmental component for an awareness threshold of 50 and a perceived pollutant concentration of 35 initial and fixed perceived pollutant concentration in the case of no information about the pollutant concentration is approximately equal to 0 thus there is no difference between awareness thresholds higher than 50 they correspond to a significantly light involvement of farmers in this set an awareness raising measure has to set the threshold at least below 50 mg l in order to trigger an increase of final share of low input farmers with the two information measures combined information about concentration and awareness raising solid lines in fig 5 the final share of low input farmers is higher whatever the awareness threshold moreover there are still three sets of awareness thresholds nevertheless they have shifted set 1b awareness thresholds from 0 to 25 mg l the awareness raising measure has no effect the range of thresholds where the measure has no effect has been expanded compared to set 1a thus the information measure increases the threshold at which investing in an awareness measure has an effect on the final share of low input farmers set 2b awareness thresholds from 25 to 65 mg l an awareness raising measure has a greater impact when the awareness threshold is medium with or without information on pollutant concentrations nevertheless the set of awareness threshold where there is a high impact of the awareness raising measure has shifted and has been extended to 65 mg l thus the information about pollutant concentrations allows the awareness raising measure to have an impact on farmers with higher awareness thresholds set 3b awareness thresholds higher than 65 mg l the set where the awareness raising measure has to be important has shifted on the right thus the information measure about the pollutant concentration permits to improve the effect of awareness raising measure for farmers with a high awareness threshold finally the awareness raising measure has the greatest effect for a population with a medium sensitivity threshold moreover when the two measures are combined the information measure on the pollution level being the domain of low threshold populations for which there is no need to invest in the awareness measure and it improves its effect for populations with a high threshold grey intervals in fig 5 4 2 impact of the variation in the initial level of pollution the second set of simulations shows that the final share of low input farmers increases with the initial concentration of pollutants see fig 6 below a certain level of initial concentration the final share of low input farmers and the final concentration are the same then farmers involvement increases steadily with the initial concentration finally above a certain initial concentration the share of low input farmers is quite stable a high initial concentration leads to a higher involvement of farmers in the protection programme from the start of its implementation then other farmers are involved due to the subjective norm and even if the concentration decreases final concentration lower than initial concentration the subjective norm maintains the level of farmers involvement when the pollutant concentration is lower the farmers get involved later when the concentration increases for more details on the transition pathway of the share of low input farmers depending on the concentration for different initial concentrations see in appendix 5 an example for a low initial concentration 0 mg l a medium initial concentration 34 mg l and a high initial concentration 50 mg l 4 3 influence of heterogeneity in farmers environmental preferences on the impact of information measures 4 3 1 influence of different combinations of eps uniform population versus highly heterogeneous population we test different combinations of values of eps for the two groups of the population with eps w1 w2 varying between 0 and 1 fig 7 a displays the final share of low input farmers depending on w1 and w2 and fig 7b shows different sections of 7a for both groups the environmental component is higher than the financial component see section 4 1 1 therefore the higher are the eps the higher is the final share of low input farmers first let us analyse the results in the case of a uniform population where the eps of the groups are equal i e all farmers have the same ep w1 w2 this corresponds to the dashed lines cross section b in fig 7a and 7b for a uniform population the higher are the eps the higher is the final share of low input farmers in this section the eps are the same and equal the average of eps i e a w1 w2 2 second we consider the case of an heterogeneous population we called the heterogeneity of the population the difference in eps between the groups i e the higher is the difference the more heterogeneous is the population the heterogeneous population is the population with the higest heterogeneity for this purpose we fix an ep to one population 0 or 1 and we vary the ep of the second population from 0 to 1 leading to a ep difference between 0 uniform population and 1 highest heterogeneous population it corresponds to the purple solid lines in fig 7a i e the first part of the curve is if a є 0 0 5 w1 2 a and w2 0 cross section a1 and the second part is if a є 0 5 1 w1 1 and w2 2 a 1 cross section a2 the average of eps increases along these lines for the heterogeneous population the results are the same than the uniform population the higher the eps the higher the final share of low input farmers therefore for both types of populations the increase of eps has a similar effect third we now compare the results with both populations according to the average of eps the average of eps can vary from 0 to 1 we plotted the evolution of two types of populations in fig 7b in purple a dashed line for the uniform population w1 w2 and a solid line for the heterogeneous population this latter corresponds to the two cross sections of a1 and a2 from fig 7a as expected the final share of low input farmers increases with the average of eps the final share of low input farmers is higher with the heterogeneous population when the average of eps is low and is higher with the uniform population when the average of eps is high 4 3 2 individual and social drivers of the influence of heterogeneity in farmers environmental preferences let us analyse the results in the case of a fixed average population where the average eps of groups is fixed i e w1 w2 2 a for example a population with a fixed average of 0 5 thus w1 1 w2 and a population with a fixed average of 0 25 thus w1 0 5 w2 correspond to the dotted lines in fig 7a and 7b cross section c and d respectively for these two cases the final share of low input farmers for a population with a fixed average of eps depends on the difference between the eps of the groups for the population with a fixed average of 0 5 cross section c in fig 7 the closer are the eps i e at the centre of the figure the higher is the final share of low input farmers by contrast the further are the eps i e the more heterogeneous is the population the lower is the final share of low input farmers the opposite holds true for the population with a fixed average of 0 25 cross section d in fig 7 the c and d sections highlight that the effect of the heterogeneity of the groups depends on the average of eps and underline the two drivers of the model first the individual driver acting through the environmental component of attitude has a different weight depending on the farmers groups eps second the social driver acting through the subjective norm sn has the same weight for all farmers when the fixed ep average is equal to 0 5 the driver leading to more changes in low input farming is the individual driver when the fixed ep average is equal to 0 25 the driver leading to more changes in low input farming is the social driver the threshold above which the individual driver becomes more important than the social driver is the intersection between the two types of populations in fig 7b above this point it means that the individual driver is sufficient on average to encourage farmers to change their practices below this point the individual driver is not sufficient and the social driver becomes more important 5 discussion and conclusions 5 1 contributions and policy implications water pollution is a major environmental concern and improving water quality is one of the main management goals at both national and supra national scales our study explored the role of information measures in programmes designed to protect water quality in the literature the role of information has been explored through the analysis of social learning processes e g shaijumon and james 2018 benyishay and mobarak 2019 baggio and hillis 2019 the study of the imitation strategies e g efferson et al 2007 baggio et al 2018 rebaudo and dangles 2015 or the assessment of expected value e g davis et al 2019 previous research has also focused on the water resource e g kaiser et al 2020 nevertheless to our best knowledge no study has dealt with information in the specific context of water quality managment moreover although the literature recognises that information based policies are of interest in the context of environmental policies e g blackstock et al 2010 ervin ervin 1982 prokopy et al 2008 the decision making mechanisms involved are not yet well understood the first contribution of this paper is therefore to formalise the role of information about the ecological system in farmers decision making processes our results showed that the involvement of farmers in protection programmes depends on the information given about water pollution and about the consequences of this pollution in addition the difference between environmental preferences in the farmers population affects the diffusion of low input farming practices the higher are the farmers environmental preferences on average the more farmers will adopt practices favourable to water quality heterogeneity in farmers preferences is a factor fostering the adoption of eco friendly practices when the average preference is sufficiently low whereas it hinders adoption when the average preference is high thus the difference in environmental preferences between farmers has to be taken into account in the choice of public policies this is in line with the study by garforth et al 2003 who found that an important point in the provision of information and advice is to recognise the diversity of the motivations of land managers it is important to recognise the heterogeneity of those managing land water relationships and to tailor advice to the different farming contexts and cultures finally different initial concentrations are also a determinant of the involvement of farmers farmers participation increases with the initial pollution level nevertheless these conclusions are to be interpreted in light of two caveats first we suppose that there is no irreversibility in the water quality problems second the time during which the policy is not implemented and during which the concentration of pollutants increases could have negative consequences such as an increase in the cost of depolluting to produce drinking water or an increase in health related costs the second contribution of this article is methodological our model is an illustration of an agent based complex system described by an et al 2021 using the concept of an information instrument and its impact on the decision making process the operationalisation and implementation in a mathematical model of this concept contribute to the debates on the definition of it and use the role of information has already been studied in models using the tpb but only with regard to the financial motivation of behaviour muelder and filatova 2018 verwaart and valeeva 2011 and to the best of our knowledge it has not been implemented in the context of an environmental factor more specifically in terms of implementation our work contributes toward integrating ecological dimensions in the conceptualisation of the attitude factor of the tpb coupled with the use of information we propose a formalisation of the environmental component of attitude using an awareness threshold and the state of the water body this differs from the modelling of environmental attitudes in previous studies such as the use of the co2 emission saving of solar panels muelder and filatova 2008 environmental friendliness of energy conservation behaviours raihanian mashadi and behdad 2018 or the environmental productivity of a farming practice xu et al 2018 5 2 limitations and perspectives we formalised the role of information in farmers decision making process through a dynamical model we identify five avenues for future work concerning the heterogeneity of farmers the environmental component of attitude the change in environmental preferences the network dynamics and the possibility to return to high input farming practices first we considered only two homogeneous groups of farmers with different environmental preferences nevertheless we may explore the influence of having more groups or including variations in the groups for example broch and vedel 2012 using a survey analysed the heterogeneity in farmers preferences for agri environmental schemes and identified four groups with divergent preferences regarding their willingness to accept compensation and to engage in groundwater and biodiversity protection second the conceptualisation of the environmental component of attitude could be improved the influence of the concentration of pollutants is the same during the simulation nevertheless the variation in concentration could be linked with the behaviour of the farmer or of the farmer s network for example if the farmer sees as a consequence of the changes in practices in her network a decrease in the pollution level he or she is more likely to change their behaviour than if they see no change indeed slower changes in water quality may result in farmers being less motivated to adopt low input practices okumah et al 2021 additionally the process could be moderated as a function of the trust in public authorities the trust in public authorities has been shown to have a positive effect on the participation in agri environmental schemes arnaud et al 2007 lastra bravo et al 2015 third a process of change in environmental preferences could be considered the information about the consequences of water pollution could also change farmers environmental preferences in addition to changes in the awareness threshold in this case the provision of information will have consequences not only on the behaviour of the farmers but also on their decision making process with a longer term change fourth the conceptualisation of the social component can be improved both by including dynamics of the social network or by adding other cognitive and affective processes the social network might evolve in time according to farmers choices and or their environmental preferences for instance this would create a feedback between the governance component the social component and the choices of farming practices moreover the social component correspond to a conformist network where the farmer has a tendency to follow the majority we could further integrate a tendency to imitate success e g effersion et al 2007 or to be mavericks e g efferson et al 2008 finally we did not include in our model the possibility to revert to the original farming practices after a few years of entering the protection programme however in europe the agri environmental contracts end after 5 years and the farmers are free of any contractual commitment concerning their land management choice they can therefore revert to their previous practices the introduction of a reversion process could be interesting in order to highlight the influence of economic and information instruments on the longer term for example khufuss et al 2016 show that information about what other farmers intend to do can greatly influence a farmer s decision in maintaining the practices after the end of agri environmental contracts 5 3 concluding remarks we investigated the role of information measures in the change in farming practices and thus their impact on water pollution the extension of an agent based model of a drinking catchment area allowed us to explore the impact of the information about pollution and the consequences of pollution the effect of the diversity of environmental preferences among farmers and the influence of the initial level of pollution our contributions are methodological and theoretical first the implementation of information in an agent based model and the description of the environmental attitude contribute to debates on the use of these concepts in computer models second we highlighted that targeting farmers who have higher environmental preferences is more effective than no targeting when half of the population can be subject to the information campaign moreover when this measure is combined with the awareness raising measure once a certain threshold of public awareness is reached there is a synergy between them furthermore the heterogeneity between farmers in terms of environmental preferences has an influence on the involvement of farmers in the programme depending on the average environmental concern finally under certain conditions in terms of information and population characteristics the higher is the initial pollution the higher is the involvement of farmers in the environmental programme credit authorship contribution statement amélie bourceret methodology software formal analysis writing original draft laurence

background ii i a which general concepts theories or hypotheses are underlying the model s design at the system level or at the level s of the submodel s apart from the decision model what is the link to complexity and the purpose of the model the ecological submodel is a linear reservoir model whose storage law and discharge law vary linearly as a function of the water level the linear reservoir model in its simplest form appears well adapted to quite variable situations ranging from small highly urbanized watersheds to watersheds of several hundred hectares ministère de la transition écologique et solidaire 2020 the governance submodel is a choice of a protection programme that can include the following measures information measure about the pollution level and awareness raising measure financial compensation individual training and technical support fixed measures the choice is about the farmers targeted by the measures and about the level of the awareness threshold financial compensation they are based on agri environmental scheme that are eu common agricultural policy s instruments farmers voluntary commit to adopt low input farming practices in return for a financial compensation this compensation aims at covering the costs and income losses resulting from the change as well as transaction costs it influences the economic profits associated with a farming practice hence the economic component of the attitude the compensation is provided annually for five years training technical support and awareness raising are individual support measures to farmers in their changes of practices e g technical advice meetings technical tests experiments according to paineau et al 1998 and lastra bravo et al 2015 training and information for farmers are key elements that promote a greater respect for the environment in the model this measure affects the perceived control by increasing farmers knowledge about a farming practice knowledge persists in time information measure about the pollution level the information given to the farmers is the monitored concentration of pollutants in the water body this information measure can target all farmers or a certain share of farmers depending on the intensity of information diffusion when a farmer is concerned by the information measure she receives information about the pollutant concentration at each time step one year the information modifies ci t in the calculation of the environmental component of attitude eq 4 awareness raising measure the objective is to lower the awareness threshold of farmers therefore the information will modify α in the calculation of the environmental component of attitude eq 3 the modification of the awareness threshold for a farmer is permanent ii i b on what assumptions is are the agents decision model s based we adapt the theory of planned behaviour tpb ajzen 1991 in this framework the intention towards a behaviour considered as a trustworthy predictor as whether or not the behaviour will be performed is influenced by three global variables judgment about the desirability of the behaviour and its consequences attitude towards behaviour considerations about the influence and opinions of others on that behaviour subjective norm and beliefs about the individual s ability to succeed in the behaviour perceived behavioural control the attitude comprises two components a financial component and an environmental component eqs 3 and 4 ii i c why is a are certain decision model s chosen one of the most frequently used approach to understand farmers decision making with regard to agri environmental policies is the theory of reasoned action developed by ajzen and fishbein ajzen and fishbein 1980 toma and mathijs 2007 falconer 2000 who was later extended to the tpb ajzen 1991 ii i d if the model a submodel e g the decision model is based on empirical data where does the data come from ii i e at which level of aggregation

decision making included farmers decide if there are involved in the protection programme and accordingly apply low input farming practice governance give information about the pollution level and about the negative consequences of water pollution on health economy and biodiversity and target some farmers for its measures ii ii b what is the basic rationality behind agents decision making in the model do agents pursue an explicit objective or have other success criteria farmers act if their intention exceeds a threshold this intention is a function of their beliefs about the behaviour in term of attitude subjective norm and perceived behavioural control ii ii c how do agents make their decisions if the farmer is not in the protection programme and thus do not practice low input farming she compares her intention to be involved in the programme ii t and her behavioural threshold ωi if the behavioural threshold is exceeded she enters in the programme and change to low input farming 1 calculation of intentions ii t which is a linear function of the following factors weighted γa γs γp by their contribution in the intention attitude ai weighted sum of a comparison between profit and environmental component subjective norm si t percentage of low input farmers in networks perceived behavioural control p knowledge and past experiences2 compare intentions with behavioural

change the expected profit of farming practices and expected control ii v b what internal models are agents assumed to use to estimate future conditions or consequences of their decisions farmers attitude is the judgement about the desirability of their behaviour and consequences this attitude is divided in a financial and an environmental component the financial component of the attitude use the expected income from the farming practice and the environmental component use the output effect of farming practice on watershed ii v c might agents be erroneous in the prediction process and how is it implemented no they are not erroneous for the financial component they calculate the difference normalized between the expected income of actual farming practice and the other farming practive the environmental component is the judgement of farmer i on the environmental desirability of changing to low input farming practices it depends on the perception of the concentration of pollutants c i t and on an individual awareness threshold α if farmers perceive a good water quality they judge that there is no environmental desirability for them to change to low input farming practices the perception of a high concentration of pollutants implies a belief in the importance of changing practices that contribute to increasing the environmental component of the attitude ii vi interaction ii

2 we presented the effect of initial concentrations on the final share of low input farmers to go further we analysed the transition pathway of the share of low input farmers depending on the concentration for different initial concentrations we chose three initial concentrations with different effects to illustrate our analysis see fig a 5 1 a low initial concentration 0 mg l 2 a medium initial concentration 34 mg l 3 a high initial concentration 50 mg l we compare the pathway with the equilibrium states depending on fixed shares of low input farmers these equilibrium states correspond to the balance between the quantity of pollutant exiting the water body and the quantity of pollutant entering through the high input practices of farmers dashed lines in fig a 5 1 in the first case there is a low initial pollution since at the beginning of the simulation all farmers practice high input agriculture the concentration will naturally increase and even if there are some low input farmers thanks to the protection programme as long as the share of low input farmers remains low i e below the equilibrium states dashed line in fig a 5 the concentration of pollutants increases despite the increase in the share of low input farmers close to the equilibrium states there is a slight decrease in the concentration 2 when the initial concentration is medium first the concentration of pollutants increases despite the increase in the share of low input farmers and then it decreases indeed while the quantity of pollutants entering the system is higher than the quantity exiting the concentration increases it corresponds to a concentration lower than the concentration at the equilibrium state for the same share of low input farmers after a few steps when the concentration is higher than the equilibrium the concentration of pollutants decreases until reaching equilibrium this is due to the time it takes for the grounwater body to react 3 the last case represents the cases where the concentration decreases during the entire simulation in this simulation the initial concentration is higher than the concentration of pollutants entering the system at each further step the concentration in water is still higher than the concentration entering until the equilibrium thus the concentration decreases with the share of low input farming 
24244,the segura river basin in south east spain is home to aquatic and dry land ecosystems of regional significance pressurised over the course of the last five decades by interests of agricultural origin the basin is caught up in a persistent water crisis traversed by conflict and socio ecological deterioration this article presents a socio ecological system characterisation of the segura river basin with a focus on the interactions between institutional performance and expectations on irrigation water supply the contribution of this research is twofold first it provides a model that develops a conceptual articulation of a socio ecological framework in the idiom of systems dynamics second it generates both numerical and qualitative policy relevant insights into the basin s crisis in a way that fully reflects its complexity our results indicate that 333 100 ha of drylands and agro natural landscapes were lost to agriculture and that groundwater overexploitation reached 500 hm3 within the 1960 2021 modelling horizon our work accurately models the pervasive impacts of intensive agriculture expansion in the segura basin and portrays some of the socio ecological consequences of the hydraulic paradigm in spain raising crucial doubts on the dominant forms of water governance in the region keywords irrigated agriculture hydraulic paradigm system dynamics modelling socio

segura river basin socio ecological system data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction agriculture is one of the most relevant and apparent drivers of ecosystem transformation globally ramankutty et al 2008 the trade offs inherent to intensive agriculture and propagated across the food production chain not only contribute to the ecological deterioration of various habitats but also constitute a tangible threat to the livelihoods of rural communities worldwide foley et al 2005 freshwater consumption is fundamental in framing the intricate juxtaposition and intersection of these agricultural trade offs hoekstra and chapagain 2008 given the material and multi scale dependency of local food deficits and global trade dynamics marchand et al 2016 seekell et al 2017 to disentangle these intricate interdependencies perspectives embracing the nontrivial nonlinear links between agriculture and water governance have been widely recommended d odorico et al 2018 rosa et al 2020 we adopt a socio ecological systems ses perspective to investigate the problematics linked to the excessive growth of irrigated agriculture in the semiarid ecosystems of the segura river basin in south east spain put differently the effects of the unchecked expansion of irrigated agriculture in the segura river basin predicated on the local paradigm of water governance constitute our research problem our research hypothesis states that the seemingly intractable problematics emanating therefrom can be better explained by means of a socio ecological systems purview of the basin this improved understanding of the basin we demonstrate obtains from the possibilities that a ses framework offers to reason about the nonlinear connections between people and nature under conditions of water stress martinez fernandez et al 2021 preiser et al 2018 our model approaches nonlinearity in the form of feedback loops and cycles undergirding the system s dynamics which we simulate in order to recuperate persistent and structural changes over the socio ecological history of the basin our quantitative modelling pivots around the growth of irrigated agriculture across the basin based on the expectation feedback loops triggered by the tagus segura transfer tst project and further reinforced by the confederación hidrográfica del segura chs to identify the role of the tst project and to situate the testing of our modelling hypotheses we discriminate the total irrigated area tia across the basin into two groups the tst irrigated areas also referred to as the tst jurisdiction comprising approximately 198 178 ha chs 1998 with regularised water abstraction licenses issued between the 1970 s and 1998 and the irrigated areas outwith the tst jurisdiction comprising approximately 135 000 ha chs 2005 which should not have access to transferred water for irrigation as per the current chs normative but whose numbers have steadily grown from the mid xxth century onwards this institutional conundrum is at the heart of our model s nonlinear dynamics helping us explain some of the main environmental impacts afflicting the basin namely the pollution of water flows groundwater overexploitation and the transformation of drylands agro natural landscapes into irrigated lands the remainder of this article is structured in five sections section two provides a socio ecological description of the segura river basin section three presents the conceptual and methodological underpinnings of our model section four reports the model s performance and results these results are discussed in section five finally the article concludes with a summary of our findings and an outline of policy recommendations 2 the segura river basin socio ecological system the segura river raises in jaén and flows southeast through semiarid lands of marls and clays fig 1 the region is characterised by mild winter temperatures high solar irradiance and high potential evapotranspiration chs 2022a the average rainfall in the basin is 385 mm year with great spatio temporal variations across regions chs 2015 the basin has a variable orography and a complex hydrogeological structure evidenced in many small and medium sized aquifers chs 2013 the interplay of ground and surface water along with other biophysical attributes sustain the ecology of the arid ecosystems which dominate the basin esteve selma 2006 esteve selma and calvo 2000 among these dry river or ephemeral streams are centres of endemism as species must adapt to their extreme environmental conditions and key in guaranteeing the livelihoods of local communities vidal abarca gutiérrez et al 2022 vidal abarca et al 2020 the dynamics of transferred water and irrigation is also key to understanding the socio ecology of the basin the segura basin receives water from the tagus river through the tst project its construction began in 1970 and water started flowing out of the tagus headwaters to the segura in 1979 hernández mora et al 2014 the volume of transferred water has neither met the original supply expectations nor the growing demand martinez fernandez and esteve selma 2000 starke et al 2017 thus inducing a water imbalance to which farmers have responded by diversifying water sources for irrigation that is by extracting water mainly from aquifers aldaya et al 2019 martinez fernandez et al 2021 we trace this gap in water provision often termed although a misnomer water deficit to the institutional pathologies typified in the literature as the hydraulic paradigm hernández mora et al 2014 martinez fernandez et al 2020 saurí and del moral 2001 swyngedouw 2015 the hydraulic paradigm refers to the recuperation of the late xixth century regeneracionista narrative into the spanish dictatorship s mission to conquer a hard dry landscape i e to correct all natural water imbalances through hydraulic infrastructure lopez gunn 2009 swyngedouw 2007 the paradigm s more immediate manifestations took shape in the form of large scale public funded engineering enterprises lacking both risk and viability assessments and of a feeble water governance model based on a pseudo technocratic top down approach swyngedouw 1999 the less apparent consequences came in the form of a consolidated elite of technicians irrigators hydropower companies and public infrastructure developers concentrating all relevant water policy decisions pérez mezo and díaz 1999 intending to correct the structural deficit of the segura river basin the 1971 water decree set the maximum volume of transferred water to 385 hm3 year by syphoning off the surplus water from the tagus see fig 2 this chapter in the hydraulic paradigm narrative was truncated by three concurring events the self reinforcing effect of the expectations on new water volumes the resulting expansion of irrigated lands beyond the originally planned martinez fernandez et al 2021 sanchis ibor et al 2017 and the depletion of water resources in the upper tagus hernández mora et al 2014 recognising and unravelling the role of the hydraulic paradigm in the expansion of irrigated agriculture is crucial to understanding the segura river basin as a ses the paradigm subtends the ideation materialisation and shortcomings of the tst project and ultimately helps identifying the drivers of the ecological deterioration of the basin moreover it allows us to illustrate how the current governance model of the basin is conducive to the perpetuation of economic interests that are exploitive of and disconnected from the socio ecological systems they rely upon 3 research methods we approach the socio ecological crisis of the segura river basin from the perspective of systems theory using canonical dynamic system modelling methods lade et al 2022 sterman 2000 we delineate the trajectory of a segura river basin socio ecological system srbses this approach allows for a regime shift reading of the crisis a reading uncovering the counter intuitive impacts of managerial views on water governance which are often hidden behind dominant narratives shifting current approaches to the governance of the srbses calls for renovated analytical perspectives on the complexities inherent to ses modelling this work in particular is concerned with the non linear properties of the srbses we identify the feedback loops mobilising the systemic changes and perturbations leading to large persistent and unexpected reorganisation phenomena impacting both the structure and functioning of the srbses we also make explicit the connections between our systems dynamic model with agent and network based interpretations of the srbses hoping subsequent research may look into the socio ecological pathways towards a benign transition of the basin in this context and as customary in the ses literature the srbses can be fully characterised in terms of structure and function biggs et al 2022 folke 2007 the structure of the srbses model is described by two types of constituting elements to which we refer as variables or nodes water abstractors whether formal tst users or not and the chs are depicted as control variables or performative nodes while the basin s ground and surface water networks along with the more conspicuous ecological structure at the landscape level of the local semiarid ecosystem are identified as state variables or descriptive nodes we recognise the srbses s dynamics in the coextensive behaviour of irrigated land expansion and the historical patterns of water use characterised thusly the self reinforcing mechanisms i e non linearity the reactiveness i e adaptiveness and the environmental impacts of the water governance problematics introduced in section 2 and identified elsewhere in the literature e g ibor et al 2011 martinez fernandez et al 2008 rupérez moreno et al 2017 become apparent in the language of ses theory the srbses model can be considered an adaptive complex open subsystem of a larger segura river ses 3 1 conceptual model underlying hypotheses and assumptions fig 3 illustrates the key factors and linkages of the srbses model the model pivots around the total irrigated area in the basin treated as the material consequent of the expectation formation and reinforcement mechanisms prompting inconsequential water abstraction practices i e the hydraulic paradigm two key causal mechanisms govern the system s dynamics i e the decision to irrigate abstract water and by extension the environmental impacts to the basin namely the expectation loop of transferred water volumes leading to the expansion of intensive agriculture r loop and the institutional feedback loop embodied by the chs b loop in fig 3 these loops are signalled by the purple and orange self enclosing arrows respectively the b loop portrays the stages at which informal irrigated areas are formalised and further incentivised the legalisation of informally tst irrigated areas is based solely on the chs s recognition of the farmers ability to use transferred water via water abstraction licenses martinez fernandez and esteve selma 2000 the legalised areas are subsequently incorporated into the chs s official registry of beneficiaries hence regularised ibor et al 2011 at this stage regularised abstractors become subjects of rights and responsibilities i e objects of potential sanctions even if retroactive nevertheless sanctions are rarely forthcoming nor are the levels of officially announced planned tst water supply actualised fomenting higher expectations on the future availability of tst water for irrigation the net effect is the sustained apparition of new informally irrigated areas the r loop describes the mechanisms leading to the formation of these expectations the r loop portrays the articulation of the performative nodes around the volumes of demanded planned and effectively available water in tracing the interconnectedness of these nodes we recuperate the formation expectation mechanism from the contribution of surface water for irrigation and the inflated values of planned tst water these expectations are only partially modified by current knowledge about the actual volumes of effectively transferred water which are later amplified by the equivocal institutional efforts to correct the water imbalance this is where both loops meet and complement one another we argue that the expansive drive of informal irrigation marks the point of articulation between the two loops because the chs s legalisation imperative cancels its own regulatory capacity acting as a form of factual validation for higher but insubstantial expectations on the tst water volumes available for irrigation in this sense the apparition of new areas of informal irrigation also governs the srbses dynamics via the tia and ultimately through the prevalence and severity of the ecological impacts associated with irrigated agriculture this dynamics is operated through the juxtaposition i e the quasi nestling of the two loops giving autonomy to the r loop as though the b loop would imprint a momentum wherefrom the r loop could operate independently we characterise the ensuing socio ecological crisis born out of this loop interconnectedness by way of the overexploitation and pollution of groundwater the loss of drylands and semi natural areas and the salinisation of the segura river signalled with red in fig 3 3 2 a systems dynamic model of the segura basin the srbses dynamics is structured around three differential equations modelling changes in distinct areas of intensive irrigation across the basin from 1960 to 2020 eq 1 describes changes in the irrigation areas originally planned as tst beneficiaries a t eq 2 describes changes in nonbeneficiary areas expected to be regularised n t eq 3 describes changes in the irrigated areas outwith the tst jurisdiction i t we approximate the tia as the summation of these three types of areas 1 δ a τ a 0 χ e i r r a τ 0 n a τ a a τ ir χ e i r r a τ 0 2 δ n τ e i r r n τ a o e l e g n τ a o t r χ τ 1998 3 δ i τ m a x l t i a τ c r χ τ 1998 e r χ τ 1998 before moving forward let us note that χ k 1 if the condition k holds and χ k 0 in every other situation 1 1 χ k acts as an indicator function with respect to k and that τ 1960 2020 eq 1 aggregates the initial area of irrigated lands a 0 to the difference between new irrigated areas n a t and effectively irrigated areas a a t as modulated by the expectations on the availability of water for irrigation e i r r a t this difference is subsequently fine tuned by a fixed annual ratio of land transformation ir i e a modelling parameter eq 2 explains new irrigation areas through the joint contribution of two expectation mechanisms adjusted by a tst dependent annual ratio of land transformation t r one of these mechanisms formalises the b loop using the smoothed value of tst irrigable not yet regularised lands to approximate the farmers perceptions on water availability e i r r n t the other mechanism models the change in legislation proper to the r loop e l e g t by smoothing the number of irrigable lands in process of regularisation e l e g n t eq 3 expresses that the change in the irrigated areas outwith the tst jurisdiction is the product of the annual ratio of land transformation c r t and the difference between the maximum area of irrigable land m a x l and the total irrigated area in the basin t i a t c r t varies to reflect the impact of the ebro transfer announcement on the growth of irrigated land across the basin c r t takes the values c r 0 0011 throughout 1960 1998 and e r 0 013 from 1999 onwards in the next section we explain how these parameters were obtained i e calibrated a succinct description of the equations governing the environmental impacts generated by the increase in irrigated lands derived from eqs 1 3 can be found on table 1 refer to appendix a for details on the remaining variables of our model to measure nitrate in groundwater n g τ we multiplied the t i a τ by τ potential increase in nitrates 2 2 the difference between the accumulated nitrate in groundwater for the previous year and the maximum quantity of nitrates reported for the campo de cartagena by the chs and n r annual nitrates influx we quantify the loss of drylands and natural landscape l d τ as the difference between the t i a τ and the net area of intensive irrigation in 1960 i τ 0 a τ 0 we use the hydraulic conductivity as a proxy of

aggregated volume of water use which includes water uses distinct from irrigation o w τ and the aggregated volume of renewable water resources which includes resources distinct from tst water o s τ based on the revisión del plan especial de sequía chs 2018 we established a ratio of undersupplied irrigated areas w r in order to compute the fraction of the t i a τ exclusively dependent on groundwater the o w τ and o s τ values were retrieved from datasets reported by the chs chs 1998 2015 2022a 2022b for more details see appendix c 4 results we conduct structure oriented tests to validate the srbses model namely dimensional consistency extreme conditions and goodness of fit tests an additional sensitivity analysis complements the results of these tests overall the srbses model demonstrates conceptual robustness and empirical aptness for details see appendix b the parametric coherence of the srbses model was corroborated through a two stage sensitivity analysis in the spirit of schouten et al 2012 comprising a one at a time assessment oat of the model at threshold limit values and monte carlo simulations ranging over a wider spectrum the oat allows for a rapid evaluation of the effects extreme parameter values have on the model s target variables for each one of the 13 model parameters 3 3 the set of target variables comprises the total tst irrigation area total irrigated area in the segura basin aquifer overexploitation nitrate in groundwater and salinisation of the segura river the monte carlo simulations mc use uninformative priors i e uniform distributions over a latin cube partition of the parametric event space to attain a simultaneous global exploration of the relevant parameters 4 4 those with a sensitivity coefficient equal or higher than 50 banos gonzalez et al 2018 uusitalo et al 2015 our results indicate a low to moderate response of the target variables to changes in the corresponding parameters sensitivity metrics for both oat and mc procedures can be found in appendix b in other words the model s outputs are robust to changes in parameter values within the model the dimensional consistency test is oftentimes seen as an empirical check on a model s coherence the test determines whether the right and left hand sides of each equation i e eqs 1 3 are consistent with respect to the measuring units of their empirical counterparts all our dynamic variables preserve metric consistency i e the srbses model is metric invariant with respect to ha year units of a distinct nature is the extreme condition test where the system s behaviour is probed under a set of conditions different from its underlying modelling assumptions this set of conditions gives way to the following test scenarios the expectations on transferred water for irrigation are ineffectual there is no increase in tst planned areas unplanned tst areas are not regularised there is no increase in either planned or unplanned tst areas and neither the tst nor the ebro transfer are deemed impactful none of the constraints in these scenarios disprove the srbses s functioning for details see appendix b and the ratio of the number of successful i e synthetically valid scenarios to the product of the number of dynamic and total variables is relatively low 0 0029 5 5 this is the value of the reality check index computed by vensim a metric used to approximate modelling adequacy thus providing evidence of modelling correctness we approach the goodness of fit test as a probing into the model s capacity to replicate observed irrigation patterns across the segura basin see table 2 we use the mean absolute percentage error mape goh and law 2002 and the normalised root mean square error nrmse andarzian et al 2011 granderson and price 2012 sepaskhah et al 2013 statistics to assess the accuracy of the simulations and to quantify the typical size of the associated errors respectively mape values below 10 are considered highly accurate those between 10 and 20 are good while those between 20 and 50 are deemed reasonable lewis 1982 nrmse values range from 0 to 10 when the results are excellent between 10 and 20 when they are considered good and fair when they vary from 20 to 30 granderson and price 2012 sepaskhah et al 2013 as per m a p e t i a 0 029 and n r m s e t i a 3 82 the srbses model not only can accurately replicate the tia s historical trend but can also guarantee small deviations from the observed data see table 2 fig 4 illustrates this by retracing changes in the tia from the relatively low and steady levels of the mid 1960 s early 70 s when the intensively irrigated surface of the basin reached the 125 000 ha to the steep transition beyond the 299 500 ha and 427 000 ha thresholds observed in the 90 s and the 2020 s m a p e t s t 0 062 and n r m s e t s t 7 79 indicate a good fit to the observed data i e total tst irrigated area fig 5 c fig 5a and b show the simulated behaviour of the planned and unplanned areas which are distinctly addressed at a conceptual level by the srbses see fig 3 fig 5c illustrates the role of the tst in explicating the increase in areas under intensive irrigation i e a t n t from 1973 to 1998 and how the new water demands are progressively carried over to other water sources fig 5d fig 6 shows the environmental impacts linked to the expansion of intensive irrigation conceptually these impacts act as points of articulation with other socio ecological subsystems in this sense they are conceived of as throughputs of the srbses model thus mediating the causal relation between the expectation formation mechanisms associated with the tst and the ecological degradation of the srbses see section 3 for this reason our modelling approach is not focused on a detailed representation of the biophysical dynamics subtending each one of the impacts fig 6a and c compare the simulated behaviour of nitrates in groundwater and water salinity by means of the hydraulic conductivity at 20ºc against the datasets obtained from local monitoring stations the simulated levels of nitrates in aquifers describe a trajectory smoother than that of the empirical data series retrieved from the ca07ni 44 hydrometric station located in the campo de cartagena chs 2022c which is evidenced in m a p e n g 1 09 and n r m s e n g 17 38 see table 2 however the general trend is aptly modelled as per r 2 0 613 and direct inspection of fig 6a wherefrom the well documented nitrification phenomenon obtains ranging from almost nil to over 200 mg l of nitrates by the end of the simulation the hydraulic conductivity of the segura river approximated with observations from the se0912m063 hydrometric station chs 2022e is more aptly replicated by the srbses with m a p e s l 0 04 and n r m s e s l 7 17 table 2 in which case the 1970 s to mid 90 s plateau is obtained at 2690µs cm fig 6b andd portray the loss of drylands agro natural landscapes computed as the total transformed area over the simulation period and aquifer overexploitation across the basin these data series are synthetic and produced under the assumption that the tia punctuates their comportment over the complete timeframe the natural and dryland loss reaches a value well over 300 000 ha finally aquifer overexploitation intensifies from 1990 s onwards reaching around 500 hm3 year by the end of the simulation period 5 discussion this paper illustrates the socio ecological basis of the degradation of the segura river basin through a principled systems theoretic approach we assemble a socio ecological system of the segura river basin the srbses model around two expectation formation mechanisms and assess its dynamics our contribution is twofold first from a theoretical point of view our model offers the first system dynamics articulation of the segura river basin second it provides a policy relevant account of the basin s socio ecological crisis this section delves deeper into the connections between these contributions drawing from our results in section 4 with an emphasis on the srbses s capacity to inform water governance at a conceptual level the srbses pivots around the b and r loops introduced in section 3 which model the expectation formation mechanisms i e institutional contradictoriness and unfounded projections of water availability resp we argue explain the overgrowth of intensively irrigated lands the results in section 4 support this claim and motivate a more elaborate explanation of the tia s trend and its ecological effects in terms of the contradictions inherent to the hydraulic paradigm 5 1 the srbses model institutional performance expectations on water availability and the overgrowth of intensively irrigated areas across the segura river basin our simulations indicate that the tst kick starts the ever positive trend of the tia over the 20 years following the secano to intensive irrigation transition 6 6 also known as dryland farming secano is practiced in areas where annual potential water evaporation exceeds annual precipitation a condition associated with semiarid environments peterson 2018 see figs 4 and 5 and that this trend is currently sustained by the farmers expectations on upcoming hydraulic projects see fig 5a an impetus made possible by the overexploitation of groundwater less succinctly intensive agriculture is pervasive across the basin and agriculture drives water use and prompts the development of hydraulic projects prefiguring the matter of factly commodification of surface ground water and its retroactive justification martinez fernandez and esteve selma 2005 martinez fernandez and esteve selma 2000 this is how the hydraulic paradigm unfurls to appreciate this we provide a detailed account of loop r with respect to our more abstract rendition in section 3 the tst project not only marked the transformation of the basin s landscape but reinforced the notion that money can buy water put differently the tst quite literally substantiated and sanctioned that water supply is only dependent on one s willingness or ability to pay as if it were a private good even before becoming operational the tst project including channels dams pumping roads etc fomented high expectations on a new water source that eventuated in an inconsequential secano to irrigation crop conversion del moral ituarte 2007 as our results show figs 4 and 6b furthered by the belief that fully productive lands were a precondition for gaining access to the transferred water regardless of individual water rights arrangements ibor et al 2011 this process eventuated in the sustained growth of irrigated areas belonging to nonbeneficiaries from 1973 to 1998 fig 5a once in operation the tst project struggled to supply water in the quantities originally projected fig 2 while pressurised to guarantee irrigation water to an expansive number of beneficiaries the structural nature of the ensuing water imbalance could be identified as early as 1998 when the plan de cuenca unveiled the gravity of the imbalance chs 1998 from 1992 to 1995 after a protracted period of severe drought the chs stopped regularising informal water abstractors confirming that the transferred water could not be used to irrigate new croplands therefrom martinez fernandez and esteve selma 2005 2004a the srbses model evinces this occurrence in fig 5a where the smoothing of the tia s trend signifies the halt in the regularisation process of the de facto tst irrigated lands from 1998 onwards it is in this sense that we claim that the chs regulatory capacity is countered by their market like role as water supplier the water imbalance triggered the demand for new hydraulic projects more prominently for a new transfer scheme to syphon water from the ebro river as consigned in the 1998 libro blanco del agua martinez fernandez et al 2020 just like the tst two decades before the ebro transfer set in motion a new self reinforcing expectation mechanism driving the expansion of irrigated lands above and beyond the pre existing tst ones albiac et al 2006 new croplands cropped up but the ebro transfer was never built and the total water imbalance deepened fig 5d this is an exemplar of the phenomena for which loop b accounts and which ultimately loop b in conjunction with loop r retroactively explain alongside the ecological maladies commonly associated with the segura river these maladies include a wide range of environmental impacts linked to the pollution of water flows groundwater overexploitation and the transformation of drylands agro natural landscapes into irrigated lands martinez fernandez et al 2021 5 2 the srbses in crisis the unaccounted impacts of intensive irrigation aquifer nitrification fig 6a and overexploitation fig 6d the salinisation of the segura river fig 6b and the loss of drylands agro natural landscapes fig 6c are the more apparent effects brought about by the interplay of loops b and r in the srbses model the increments of the tia link up these expectation formation mechanisms to the ecological deterioration of the basin this is how the srbses model allows us to trace some of the material consequences of a failing albeit prevalent water governance model founded upon the hydraulic paradigm in 2019 the regional government of murcia declared 14 inland and one coastal water bodies as vulnerable orden 23 de diciembre de 2019 due to a concentration of nitrates above the 50 mg l cap stipulated by the eu normative council directive 91 676 eec 1991 in 2020 the chs reported the existence of 23 groundwater bodies polluted with nitrates out of the 63 sampled across the basin garcía mariana 2020 of concern is not only that this type of groundwater pollution reappears in agriculture as e g groundwater becomes unsuitable for irrigation unless denitrified boe 148 2018 but also that nitrification contributes to the eutrophication of nearby wetlands steffen et al 2015 to elucidate the causal mechanisms underpinning these problematics in the segura river basin we successfully reproduced the readings of the ca07ni 44 hydrometric station located in the campo de cartagena chs 2022c via the simulated over growth of the tia intensive irrigated agriculture dominates the basin s landscape mosaic on account of the transferred and otherwise sourced water made available by the advent of the tst and the farmers capacity to artificially uphold profitable quantities of food exports with synthetic fertilisers pedreño et al 2022 nitrogen fertilisers are oftenest favoured for intensive farming as they promote the rapid growth of plants and encourage the unsullied development of foliage and fruits segura and pedreño 2006 foster and custodio 2019 further suggest that the rate at which nitrates in irrigation water infiltrate permeable soil profiles is slower than the rate of water table depletion attributable to excessive abstraction and that the accumulation of nitrates makes diffuse groundwater pollution a tangible threat to the basin we incorporate these considerations by connecting tia increments provoked by the interactions between loops b and r to the expansion of over fertilised areas inexpensive and soluble nitrogen fertilisers pollute both superficial and ground water bodies as the srbses model attests two of the most prominent consequences of these alterations in the nitrogen and phosphorus biogeochemical cycle s are the excess of nutrients of aquatic ecosystems eutrophication and the concomitant accumulation of phytoplankton paerl et al 2014 zhang et al 2004 this overgrowth is often conducive to algal blooms which reduce the amount of available oxygen and sunlight along any given water column eventuating in the death of other autotrophic and heterotrophic species from small crustaceans to fish eugercios silva et al 2017 le moal et al 2019 along the segura river basin these impacts are variously perceived as the eutrophic crisis of the mar menor lagoon álvarez rogel et al 2020 martinez fernandez et al 2014 the largest coastal water body in the western mediterranean and a biodiversity and tourism hotspot although a dedicated study of the mar menor ecological collapse is beyond the scope of this paper we would like to tersely outline the more recent events marking the timeline of the crisis ever since the early 2000 s scientists have denounced the anthropic origin of the lagoon s eutrophication 7 7 the increase of nitrates has been attributed to intensive irrigated agriculture while phosphates have been associated with wastewater coming from malfunctioning treatment plants between 1980 s and the 2000 and industrial pork farms more recently e g lloret et al 2005 martínez fernández esteve selma 2003 pérez ruzafa et al 2002 in 2016 algae finally tainted the mar menor green e g jimeno sáez et al 2020 martinez fernandez et al 2017 in 2019 and 2021 the algal bloom precipitated the mass die off of aquatic biota e g guerrero gómez et al 2022 the more than apparent links of these processes to intensive irrigation in the campo de cartagena derived in a series of conflicts between agriculture promotors and lagoon activists which has taken a new turn after legal personhood was granted to the mar menor in 2022 known as the ilp see vadillo 2022 the salinisation of the segura river is concurrent with the nitrification of the basin this is another environmental impact that the srbses model illustrates via r and b loop interactions see fig 3 as with the nutrient excess problematics the salinisation of the segura river is accounted for by successfully reproducing the behaviour of the se0912m063 hydrometric station chs 2022e our results in fig 6c indicate that even though the salinisation process seemed to have reached a plateau in the late 1990 s the current levels are not ecologically commendable these findings corroborate the work of estévez et al 2019 in showing that the salt build up along the segura river shifts from slight in the middle basin to heavy concentrations in the lower basin this is an alarming result for the salinisation of freshwater is directly linked to the deterioration of the inorganic nitrogen removal and carbon storage properties of aquatic environments as well as to increments in toxic sulphides which feedback the physiological stress in wetland biota initiated by the salinisation process itself herbert et al 2015 as pointed in section 3 the expansive trend of the tia has also had a sizable impact on the quality and quantity of abstracted groundwater driven by un checked expectations on water availability the regularisation of informal irrigation and the assimilation of pumping techniques all of them symptoms of the hydraulic paradigm which the b loop models farmers have historically tried to make up for the tst deficit with the abstraction of groundwater fig 6d the srbses model reproduces the growing reliance on aquifers over the last 50 years our results coincide with the overall trend identified in other works custodio et al 2016 rupérez moreno et al 2017 note that the latest official report i e the volume of abstracted groundwater in 2015 published by the chs is less than one standard deviation away from the srbses simulated value i e 207 hm3 year chs 2015 vs 280 5 hm3 year respectively as a contradistinctive qualification of our results let us also point to recent publications claiming that the tst project contributes to the replenishment of aquifers via infiltration and that the substitution of transferred water with irrigation water from more saline sources could accelerate the degradation of the basin s soils morote et al 2020 and morote et al 2017 these works are based on secondary literature mostly public policy documents and various ethnographic interventions with relevant stakeholders paradoxically we interpret such claims as illustrative or symptomatic of our diagnosis for the antecedents to their conclusions outline the expectation formation narrative conceptualised through loops r and b a closer look at our results show that aquifer overexploitation is largely coeval with the development of the tst project that is the overall trends of aquifer overexploitation fluctuate within the 10 hm3 and 40 hm3 in the early stages of the project and the 1995 and 2007 peaks of overexploitation follow the deflationary expectations triggered by concomitant but spurious hydraulic projects which made aquifers the more reliable if not the only source of irrigation water correlated with the expansion of intensively irrigated agriculture throughout the basin is the loss of drylands agro natural areas amounting to a loss of 333 100 ha by 2021 fig 6b habitat fragmentation due to land use changes has been identified as one of the main causes of terrestrial biodiversity loss globally haddad et al 2015 hanski 2015 in south east spain this phenomenon is a threat to the conservation of semiarid and arid ecosystems peñas et al 2011 even in protected sites martínez fernández and esteve selma 2004b several works have been continually reporting the severe effects of habitat loss of protected and endangered ibero african species such as periploca angustifol vegetal endemism and testudo graeca terrestrial tortoise martinez fernandez et al 2021 as well as a continuous decay of steppe birds populations e g chersophilus duponti tetrax tetrax pterocles orientalis and burhinus oedicnemus caballero et al 1996 esteve selma 2006 esteve selma et al 1995 we interpret the results of the srbses model as evidence of the continual deterioration of the basin due to iterative cycles of unrevised expectations on the amount of available water for irrigation and to the coextensive loops of reinforcing institutional leniency these findings suggest three main avenues of future research namely a critical assessment of the hydraulic mission via the srbses a supersystem extension of the srbses and its prospective refunctioning furthering the critical insight of the srbses model requires taking a closer look at its core feedback mechanisms under a more historiographic rendition of the prevalent water governance lineaments as our results show the interrelation between the b and r loops not only explain the growth of the tst irrigated areas but also reflect the shortcomings of the spanish hydraulic mission this prefigures a site to expand our understanding of the identified loops in the unfolding of similar socio ecological problematics in the region such as those raised by the ebro transfer and private desalinisation plants a larger segura basin ses model can be produced by augmenting the model with other subsystems in particular it would be fruitful to couple the srbses model with spatial modelling techniques to explore the interplay between aquifers precipitation and agricultural practices these efforts could give a better account of the uncertainties associated with our findings and contribute to a more informed understanding of the basin s superficial ground water dynamics e g explicating the observed fluctuations of nitrates in groundwater which the current version of the srbses model correctly approximates in the aggregate see section 4 finally in the face of new regulations aiming at reducing the amount of transferred water cht 2022 exploring the prospective and predictive potential of the srbses model is an imperative the model s explanatory capacity can be strengthened by including individual stakeholders e g reworking the srbses as an agent based model to elucidate alternative lower level responses of the system to the adoption of new water governance lineaments e g the modelling of the occurrence of the ilp this would require a revision of the chs s role s as well as the explicit recognition of the interactions between agriculture and water governance entities substantiated in decentralised decision making and coordination structures we anticipate also drawing evidence from the literature see oliveira et al 2022 pahl wostl 2019 that these exploratory reflections around the srbses model hold a transformative potential of the current paradigm towards a collective approach to water governance 6 conclusions the degradation of the segura river basin is one of the many manifestations of the prevalent sectoral infrastructure oriented approach to water and agriculture governance this approach is consistent with the praxis and narratives of the hydraulic mission an ideology of technological and economic development based on the domination of nature through the control and exploitation of water ecosystems molle et al 2009 in a quite explicit fashion the hydraulic mission s precepts in spain have incarnated into what is locally termed the hydraulic paradigm our research simulated the reverberations of the paradigm s pervasiveness in terms of the excessive expansion of irrigated agriculture and its impacts on the semiarid and riverine ecosystems proper to the basin our systems theoretic i e ses approach is conducive to an explicit modelling of the socio ecological feedbacks explicating the structural and functional changes configuring the basin s deterioration which we consider informative for the water governance of the basin our results show that the expectations on new hydraulic projects and the regularisation of informal water uses even if just nominally exceeded the total irrigated area in the basin in the early 1970 s and the late 1990 s to unsustainable but persistent levels of water requirements we characterise these events as a self reinforcing tst water demand extraction mechanism leading to the expansion of intensive agriculture r loop and as an institutional feedback loop portraying the chs s leniency in fulfilling its role b loop the two loops are at the core of our srbses model see section 3 explaining the behaviour of the total irrigated area over the last 50 years reaching 427 000 ha for 2021 and the extent of the associated environmental impacts according to the model nitrates in groundwater range from almost nil to over 200 mg l for 2021 while overexploited in 500 hm3 for the same year the hydraulic conductivity at 20ºc reaches a plateau at 2690µs cm in the mid 90 s and the loss of drylands agro natural landscapes to irrigated agriculture added up to 333 100 ha by 2021 the srbses model demonstrates that the socio ecological deterioration of the segura basin is acute and calls for a profound change in the way water governance lineaments are conceived and effected drawing on our results we argue that a long term system s perspective on the inapparent behavioural links between irrigated agriculture and institutional performance could counteract the socio ecological deterioration of the basin a key leverage point in the articulation of this new perspective is concerned with the role of the chs the chs could reshape its monitoring and controlling passive mission into an active praxis of waterscape transformation conscious of the influence it exerts on water abstractor groups who anticipate the chs s directives thus oriented we foresee that the role of the public may also change towards the creation of distinct spaces of engagement coordination and hopefully cooperation where the governance of the basin becomes an instance of collective transformation credit authorship contribution statement paula andrea zuluaga guerra data

24244,the segura river basin in south east spain is home to aquatic and dry land ecosystems of regional significance pressurised over the course of the last five decades by interests of agricultural origin the basin is caught up in a persistent water crisis traversed by conflict and socio ecological deterioration this article presents a socio ecological system characterisation of the segura river basin with a focus on the interactions between institutional performance and expectations on irrigation water supply the contribution of this research is twofold first it provides a model that develops a conceptual articulation of a socio ecological framework in the idiom of systems dynamics second it generates both numerical and qualitative policy relevant insights into the basin s crisis in a way that fully reflects its complexity our results indicate that 333 100 ha of drylands and agro natural landscapes were lost to agriculture and that groundwater overexploitation reached 500 hm3 within the 1960 2021 modelling horizon our work accurately models the pervasive impacts of intensive agriculture expansion in the segura basin and portrays some of the socio ecological consequences of the hydraulic paradigm in spain raising crucial doubts on the dominant forms of water governance in the region keywords irrigated agriculture hydraulic paradigm system dynamics modelling socio ecological systems semiarid ecosystems water governance abbreviations ses socio ecological systems tst tagus segura transfer chs confederación hidrográfica del segura tia total irrigated area srbses segura river basin socio ecological system data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction agriculture is one of the most relevant and apparent drivers of ecosystem transformation globally ramankutty et al 2008 the trade offs inherent to intensive agriculture and propagated across the food production chain not only contribute to the ecological deterioration of various habitats but also constitute a tangible threat to the livelihoods of rural communities worldwide foley et al 2005 freshwater consumption is fundamental in framing the intricate juxtaposition and intersection of these agricultural trade offs hoekstra and chapagain 2008 given the material and multi scale dependency of local food deficits and global trade dynamics marchand et al 2016 seekell et al 2017 to disentangle these intricate interdependencies perspectives embracing the nontrivial nonlinear links between agriculture and water governance have been widely recommended d odorico et al 2018 rosa et al 2020 we adopt a socio ecological systems ses perspective to investigate the problematics linked to the excessive growth of irrigated agriculture in the semiarid ecosystems of the segura river basin in south east spain put differently the effects of the unchecked expansion of irrigated agriculture in the segura river basin predicated on the local paradigm of water governance constitute our research problem our research hypothesis states that the seemingly intractable problematics emanating therefrom can be better explained by means of a socio ecological systems purview of the basin this improved understanding of the basin we demonstrate obtains from the possibilities that a ses framework offers to reason about the nonlinear connections between people and nature under conditions of water stress martinez fernandez et al 2021 preiser et al 2018 our model approaches nonlinearity in the form of feedback loops and cycles undergirding the system s dynamics which we simulate in order to recuperate persistent and structural changes over the socio ecological history of the basin our quantitative modelling pivots around the growth of irrigated agriculture across the basin based on the expectation feedback loops triggered by the tagus segura transfer tst project and further reinforced by the confederación hidrográfica del segura chs to identify the role of the tst project and to situate the testing of our modelling hypotheses we discriminate the total irrigated area tia across the basin into two groups the tst irrigated areas also referred to as the tst jurisdiction comprising approximately 198 178 ha chs 1998 with regularised water abstraction licenses issued between the 1970 s and 1998 and the irrigated areas outwith the tst jurisdiction comprising approximately 135 000 ha chs 2005 which should not have access to transferred water for irrigation as per the current chs normative but whose numbers have steadily grown from the mid xxth century onwards this institutional conundrum is at the heart of our model s nonlinear dynamics helping us explain some of the main environmental impacts afflicting the basin namely the pollution of water flows groundwater overexploitation and the transformation of drylands agro natural landscapes into irrigated lands the remainder of this article is structured in five sections section two provides a socio ecological description of the segura river basin section three presents the conceptual and methodological underpinnings of our model section four reports the model s performance and results these results are discussed in section five finally the article concludes with a summary of our findings and an outline of policy recommendations 2 the segura river basin socio ecological system the segura river raises in jaén and flows southeast through semiarid lands of marls and clays fig 1 the region is characterised by mild winter temperatures high solar irradiance and high potential evapotranspiration chs 2022a the average rainfall in the basin is 385 mm year with great spatio temporal variations across regions chs 2015 the basin has a variable orography and a complex hydrogeological structure evidenced in many small and medium sized aquifers chs 2013 the interplay of ground and surface water along with other biophysical attributes sustain the ecology of the arid ecosystems which dominate the basin esteve selma 2006 esteve selma and calvo 2000 among these dry river or ephemeral streams are centres of endemism as species must adapt to their extreme environmental conditions and key in guaranteeing the livelihoods of local communities vidal abarca gutiérrez et al 2022 vidal abarca et al 2020 the dynamics of transferred water and irrigation is also key to understanding the socio ecology of the basin the segura basin receives water from the tagus river through the tst project its construction began in 1970 and water started flowing out of the tagus headwaters to the segura in 1979 hernández mora et al 2014 the volume of transferred water has neither met the original supply expectations nor the growing demand martinez fernandez and esteve selma 2000 starke et al 2017 thus inducing a water imbalance to which farmers have responded by diversifying water sources for irrigation that is by extracting water mainly from aquifers aldaya et al 2019 martinez fernandez et al 2021 we trace this gap in water provision often termed although a misnomer water deficit to the institutional pathologies typified in the literature as the hydraulic paradigm hernández mora et al 2014 martinez fernandez et al 2020 saurí and del moral 2001 swyngedouw 2015 the hydraulic paradigm refers to the recuperation of the late xixth century regeneracionista narrative into the spanish dictatorship s mission to conquer a hard dry landscape i e to correct all natural water imbalances through hydraulic infrastructure lopez gunn 2009 swyngedouw 2007 the paradigm s more immediate manifestations took shape in the form of large scale public funded engineering enterprises lacking both risk and viability assessments and of a feeble water governance model based on a pseudo technocratic top down approach swyngedouw 1999 the less apparent consequences came in the form of a consolidated elite of technicians irrigators hydropower companies and public infrastructure developers concentrating all relevant water policy decisions pérez mezo and díaz 1999 intending to correct the structural deficit of the segura river basin the 1971 water decree set the maximum volume of transferred water to 385 hm3 year by syphoning off the surplus water from the tagus see fig 2 this chapter in the hydraulic paradigm narrative was truncated by three concurring events the self reinforcing effect of the expectations on new water volumes the resulting expansion of irrigated lands beyond the originally planned martinez fernandez et al 2021 sanchis ibor et al 2017 and the depletion of water resources in the upper tagus hernández mora et al 2014 recognising and unravelling the role of the hydraulic paradigm in the expansion of irrigated agriculture is crucial to understanding the segura river basin as a ses the paradigm subtends the ideation materialisation and shortcomings of the tst project and ultimately helps identifying the drivers of the ecological deterioration of the basin moreover it allows us to illustrate how the current governance model of the basin is conducive to the perpetuation of economic interests that are exploitive of and disconnected from the socio ecological systems they rely upon 3 research methods we approach the socio ecological crisis of the segura river basin from the perspective of systems theory using canonical dynamic system modelling methods lade et al 2022 sterman 2000 we delineate the trajectory of a segura river basin socio ecological system srbses this approach allows for a regime shift reading of the crisis a reading uncovering the counter intuitive impacts of managerial views on water governance which are often hidden behind dominant narratives shifting current approaches to the governance of the srbses calls for renovated analytical perspectives on the complexities inherent to ses modelling this work in particular is concerned with the non linear properties of the srbses we identify the feedback loops mobilising the systemic changes and perturbations leading to large persistent and unexpected reorganisation phenomena impacting both the structure and functioning of the srbses we also make explicit the connections between our systems dynamic model with agent and network based interpretations of the srbses hoping subsequent research may look into the socio ecological pathways towards a benign transition of the basin in this context and as customary in the ses literature the srbses can be fully characterised in terms of structure and function biggs et al 2022 folke 2007 the structure of the srbses model is described by two types of constituting elements to which we refer as variables or nodes water abstractors whether formal tst users or not and the chs are depicted as control variables or performative nodes while the basin s ground and surface water networks along with the more conspicuous ecological structure at the landscape level of the local semiarid ecosystem are identified as state variables or descriptive nodes we recognise the srbses s dynamics in the coextensive behaviour of irrigated land expansion and the historical patterns of water use characterised thusly the self reinforcing mechanisms i e non linearity the reactiveness i e adaptiveness and the environmental impacts of the water governance problematics introduced in section 2 and identified elsewhere in the literature e g ibor et al 2011 martinez fernandez et al 2008 rupérez moreno et al 2017 become apparent in the language of ses theory the srbses model can be considered an adaptive complex open subsystem of a larger segura river ses 3 1 conceptual model underlying hypotheses and assumptions fig 3 illustrates the key factors and linkages of the srbses model the model pivots around the total irrigated area in the basin treated as the material consequent of the expectation formation and reinforcement mechanisms prompting inconsequential water abstraction practices i e the hydraulic paradigm two key causal mechanisms govern the system s dynamics i e the decision to irrigate abstract water and by extension the environmental impacts to the basin namely the expectation loop of transferred water volumes leading to the expansion of intensive agriculture r loop and the institutional feedback loop embodied by the chs b loop in fig 3 these loops are signalled by the purple and orange self enclosing arrows respectively the b loop portrays the stages at which informal irrigated areas are formalised and further incentivised the legalisation of informally tst irrigated areas is based solely on the chs s recognition of the farmers ability to use transferred water via water abstraction licenses martinez fernandez and esteve selma 2000 the legalised areas are subsequently incorporated into the chs s official registry of beneficiaries hence regularised ibor et al 2011 at this stage regularised abstractors become subjects of rights and responsibilities i e objects of potential sanctions even if retroactive nevertheless sanctions are rarely forthcoming nor are the levels of officially announced planned tst water supply actualised fomenting higher expectations on the future availability of tst water for irrigation the net effect is the sustained apparition of new informally irrigated areas the r loop describes the mechanisms leading to the formation of these expectations the r loop portrays the articulation of the performative nodes around the volumes of demanded planned and effectively available water in tracing the interconnectedness of these nodes we recuperate the formation expectation mechanism from the contribution of surface water for irrigation and the inflated values of planned tst water these expectations are only partially modified by current knowledge about the actual volumes of effectively transferred water which are later amplified by the equivocal institutional efforts to correct the water imbalance this is where both loops meet and complement one another we argue that the expansive drive of informal irrigation marks the point of articulation between the two loops because the chs s legalisation imperative cancels its own regulatory capacity acting as a form of factual validation for higher but insubstantial expectations on the tst water volumes available for irrigation in this sense the apparition of new areas of informal irrigation also governs the srbses dynamics via the tia and ultimately through the prevalence and severity of the ecological impacts associated with irrigated agriculture this dynamics is operated through the juxtaposition i e the quasi nestling of the two loops giving autonomy to the r loop as though the b loop would imprint a momentum wherefrom the r loop could operate independently we characterise the ensuing socio ecological crisis born out of this loop interconnectedness by way of the overexploitation and pollution of groundwater the loss of drylands and semi natural areas and the salinisation of the segura river signalled with red in fig 3 3 2 a systems dynamic model of the segura basin the srbses dynamics is structured around three differential equations modelling changes in distinct areas of intensive irrigation across the basin from 1960 to 2020 eq 1 describes changes in the irrigation areas originally planned as tst beneficiaries a t eq 2 describes changes in nonbeneficiary areas expected to be regularised n t eq 3 describes changes in the irrigated areas outwith the tst jurisdiction i t we approximate the tia as the summation of these three types of areas 1 δ a τ a 0 χ e i r r a τ 0 n a τ a a τ ir χ e i r r a τ 0 2 δ n τ e i r r n τ a o e l e g n τ a o t r χ τ 1998 3 δ i τ m a x l t i a τ c r χ τ 1998 e r χ τ 1998 before moving forward let us note that χ k 1 if the condition k holds and χ k 0 in every other situation 1 1 χ k acts as an indicator function with respect to k and that τ 1960 2020 eq 1 aggregates the initial area of irrigated lands a 0 to the difference between new irrigated areas n a t and effectively irrigated areas a a t as modulated by the expectations on the availability of water for irrigation e i r r a t this difference is subsequently fine tuned by a fixed annual ratio of land transformation ir i e a modelling parameter eq 2 explains new irrigation areas through the joint contribution of two expectation mechanisms adjusted by a tst dependent annual ratio of land transformation t r one of these mechanisms formalises the b loop using the smoothed value of tst irrigable not yet regularised lands to approximate the farmers perceptions on water availability e i r r n t the other mechanism models the change in legislation proper to the r loop e l e g t by smoothing the number of irrigable lands in process of regularisation e l e g n t eq 3 expresses that the change in the irrigated areas outwith the tst jurisdiction is the product of the annual ratio of land transformation c r t and the difference between the maximum area of irrigable land m a x l and the total irrigated area in the basin t i a t c r t varies to reflect the impact of the ebro transfer announcement on the growth of irrigated land across the basin c r t takes the values c r 0 0011 throughout 1960 1998 and e r 0 013 from 1999 onwards in the next section we explain how these parameters were obtained i e calibrated a succinct description of the equations governing the environmental impacts generated by the increase in irrigated lands derived from eqs 1 3 can be found on table 1 refer to appendix a for details on the remaining variables of our model to measure nitrate in groundwater n g τ we multiplied the t i a τ by τ potential increase in nitrates 2 2 the difference between the accumulated nitrate in groundwater for the previous year and the maximum quantity of nitrates reported for the campo de cartagena by the chs and n r annual nitrates influx we quantify the loss of drylands and natural landscape l d τ as the difference between the t i a τ and the net area of intensive irrigation in 1960 i τ 0 a τ 0 we use the hydraulic conductivity as a proxy of salinisation s l τ being the product of the total tst irrigated area n τ a τ and an annual rate of soluble salts s r the overexploitation of aquifers a o τ is estimated as the difference between the aggregated volume of water use which includes water uses distinct from irrigation o w τ and the aggregated volume of renewable water resources which includes resources distinct from tst water o s τ based on the revisión del plan especial de sequía chs 2018 we established a ratio of undersupplied irrigated areas w r in order to compute the fraction of the t i a τ exclusively dependent on groundwater the o w τ and o s τ values were retrieved from datasets reported by the chs chs 1998 2015 2022a 2022b for more details see appendix c 4 results we conduct structure oriented tests to validate the srbses model namely dimensional consistency extreme conditions and goodness of fit tests an additional sensitivity analysis complements the results of these tests overall the srbses model demonstrates conceptual robustness and empirical aptness for details see appendix b the parametric coherence of the srbses model was corroborated through a two stage sensitivity analysis in the spirit of schouten et al 2012 comprising a one at a time assessment oat of the model at threshold limit values and monte carlo simulations ranging over a wider spectrum the oat allows for a rapid evaluation of the effects extreme parameter values have on the model s target variables for each one of the 13 model parameters 3 3 the set of target variables comprises the total tst irrigation area total irrigated area in the segura basin aquifer overexploitation nitrate in groundwater and salinisation of the segura river the monte carlo simulations mc use uninformative priors i e uniform distributions over a latin cube partition of the parametric event space to attain a simultaneous global exploration of the relevant parameters 4 4 those with a sensitivity coefficient equal or higher than 50 banos gonzalez et al 2018 uusitalo et al 2015 our results indicate a low to moderate response of the target variables to changes in the corresponding parameters sensitivity metrics for both oat and mc procedures can be found in appendix b in other words the model s outputs are robust to changes in parameter values within the model the dimensional consistency test is oftentimes seen as an empirical check on a model s coherence the test determines whether the right and left hand sides of each equation i e eqs 1 3 are consistent with respect to the measuring units of their empirical counterparts all our dynamic variables preserve metric consistency i e the srbses model is metric invariant with respect to ha year units of a distinct nature is the extreme condition test where the system s behaviour is probed under a set of conditions different from its underlying modelling assumptions this set of conditions gives way to the following test scenarios the expectations on transferred water for irrigation are ineffectual there is no increase in tst planned areas unplanned tst areas are not regularised there is no increase in either planned or unplanned tst areas and neither the tst nor the ebro transfer are deemed impactful none of the constraints in these scenarios disprove the srbses s functioning for details see appendix b and the ratio of the number of successful i e synthetically valid scenarios to the product of the number of dynamic and total variables is relatively low 0 0029 5 5 this is the value of the reality check index computed by vensim a metric used to approximate modelling adequacy thus providing evidence of modelling correctness we approach the goodness of fit test as a probing into the model s capacity to replicate observed irrigation patterns across the segura basin see table 2 we use the mean absolute percentage error mape goh and law 2002 and the normalised root mean square error nrmse andarzian et al 2011 granderson and price 2012 sepaskhah et al 2013 statistics to assess the accuracy of the simulations and to quantify the typical size of the associated errors respectively mape values below 10 are considered highly accurate those between 10 and 20 are good while those between 20 and 50 are deemed reasonable lewis 1982 nrmse values range from 0 to 10 when the results are excellent between 10 and 20 when they are considered good and fair when they vary from 20 to 30 granderson and price 2012 sepaskhah et al 2013 as per m a p e t i a 0 029 and n r m s e t i a 3 82 the srbses model not only can accurately replicate the tia s historical trend but can also guarantee small deviations from the observed data see table 2 fig 4 illustrates this by retracing changes in the tia from the relatively low and steady levels of the mid 1960 s early 70 s when the intensively irrigated surface of the basin reached the 125 000 ha to the steep transition beyond the 299 500 ha and 427 000 ha thresholds observed in the 90 s and the 2020 s m a p e t s t 0 062 and n r m s e t s t 7 79 indicate a good fit to the observed data i e total tst irrigated area fig 5 c fig 5a and b show the simulated behaviour of the planned and unplanned areas which are distinctly addressed at a conceptual level by the srbses see fig 3 fig 5c illustrates the role of the tst in explicating the increase in areas under intensive irrigation i e a t n t from 1973 to 1998 and how the new water demands are progressively carried over to other water sources fig 5d fig 6 shows the environmental impacts linked to the expansion of intensive irrigation conceptually these impacts act as points of articulation with other socio ecological subsystems in this sense they are conceived of as throughputs of the srbses model thus mediating the causal relation between the expectation formation mechanisms associated with the tst and the ecological degradation of the srbses see section 3 for this reason our modelling approach is not focused on a detailed representation of the biophysical dynamics subtending each one of the impacts fig 6a and c compare the simulated behaviour of nitrates in groundwater and water salinity by means of the hydraulic conductivity at 20ºc against the datasets obtained from local monitoring stations the simulated levels of nitrates in aquifers describe a trajectory smoother than that of the empirical data series retrieved from the ca07ni 44 hydrometric station located in the campo de cartagena chs 2022c which is evidenced in m a p e n g 1 09 and n r m s e n g 17 38 see table 2 however the general trend is aptly modelled as per r 2 0 613 and direct inspection of fig 6a wherefrom the well documented nitrification phenomenon obtains ranging from almost nil to over 200 mg l of nitrates by the end of the simulation the hydraulic conductivity of the segura river approximated with observations from the se0912m063 hydrometric station chs 2022e is more aptly replicated by the srbses with m a p e s l 0 04 and n r m s e s l 7 17 table 2 in which case the 1970 s to mid 90 s plateau is obtained at 2690µs cm fig 6b andd portray the loss of drylands agro natural landscapes computed as the total transformed area over the simulation period and aquifer overexploitation across the basin these data series are synthetic and produced under the assumption that the tia punctuates their comportment over the complete timeframe the natural and dryland loss reaches a value well over 300 000 ha finally aquifer overexploitation intensifies from 1990 s onwards reaching around 500 hm3 year by the end of the simulation period 5 discussion this paper illustrates the socio ecological basis of the degradation of the segura river basin through a principled systems theoretic approach we assemble a socio ecological system of the segura river basin the srbses model around two expectation formation mechanisms and assess its dynamics our contribution is twofold first from a theoretical point of view our model offers the first system dynamics articulation of the segura river basin second it provides a policy relevant account of the basin s socio ecological crisis this section delves deeper into the connections between these contributions drawing from our results in section 4 with an emphasis on the srbses s capacity to inform water governance at a conceptual level the srbses pivots around the b and r loops introduced in section 3 which model the expectation formation mechanisms i e institutional contradictoriness and unfounded projections of water availability resp we argue explain the overgrowth of intensively irrigated lands the results in section 4 support this claim and motivate a more elaborate explanation of the tia s trend and its ecological effects in terms of the contradictions inherent to the hydraulic paradigm 5 1 the srbses model institutional performance expectations on water availability and the overgrowth of intensively irrigated areas across the segura river basin our simulations indicate that the tst kick starts the ever positive trend of the tia over the 20 years following the secano to intensive irrigation transition 6 6 also known as dryland farming secano is practiced in areas where annual potential water evaporation exceeds annual precipitation a condition associated with semiarid environments peterson 2018 see figs 4 and 5 and that this trend is currently sustained by the farmers expectations on upcoming hydraulic projects see fig 5a an impetus made possible by the overexploitation of groundwater less succinctly intensive agriculture is pervasive across the basin and agriculture drives water use and prompts the development of hydraulic projects prefiguring the matter of factly commodification of surface ground water and its retroactive justification martinez fernandez and esteve selma 2005 martinez fernandez and esteve selma 2000 this is how the hydraulic paradigm unfurls to appreciate this we provide a detailed account of loop r with respect to our more abstract rendition in section 3 the tst project not only marked the transformation of the basin s landscape but reinforced the notion that money can buy water put differently the tst quite literally substantiated and sanctioned that water supply is only dependent on one s willingness or ability to pay as if it were a private good even before becoming operational the tst project including channels dams pumping roads etc fomented high expectations on a new water source that eventuated in an inconsequential secano to irrigation crop conversion del moral ituarte 2007 as our results show figs 4 and 6b furthered by the belief that fully productive lands were a precondition for gaining access to the transferred water regardless of individual water rights arrangements ibor et al 2011 this process eventuated in the sustained growth of irrigated areas belonging to nonbeneficiaries from 1973 to 1998 fig 5a once in operation the tst project struggled to supply water in the quantities originally projected fig 2 while pressurised to guarantee irrigation water to an expansive number of beneficiaries the structural nature of the ensuing water imbalance could be identified as early as 1998 when the plan de cuenca unveiled the gravity of the imbalance chs 1998 from 1992 to 1995 after a protracted period of severe drought the chs stopped regularising informal water abstractors confirming that the transferred water could not be used to irrigate new croplands therefrom martinez fernandez and esteve selma 2005 2004a the srbses model evinces this occurrence in fig 5a where the smoothing of the tia s trend signifies the halt in the regularisation process of the de facto tst irrigated lands from 1998 onwards it is in this sense that we claim that the chs regulatory capacity is countered by their market like role as water supplier the water imbalance triggered the demand for new hydraulic projects more prominently for a new transfer scheme to syphon water from the ebro river as consigned in the 1998 libro blanco del agua martinez fernandez et al 2020 just like the tst two decades before the ebro transfer set in motion a new self reinforcing expectation mechanism driving the expansion of irrigated lands above and beyond the pre existing tst ones albiac et al 2006 new croplands cropped up but the ebro transfer was never built and the total water imbalance deepened fig 5d this is an exemplar of the phenomena for which loop b accounts and which ultimately loop b in conjunction with loop r retroactively explain alongside the ecological maladies commonly associated with the segura river these maladies include a wide range of environmental impacts linked to the pollution of water flows groundwater overexploitation and the transformation of drylands agro natural landscapes into irrigated lands martinez fernandez et al 2021 5 2 the srbses in crisis the unaccounted impacts of intensive irrigation aquifer nitrification fig 6a and overexploitation fig 6d the salinisation of the segura river fig 6b and the loss of drylands agro natural landscapes fig 6c are the more apparent effects brought about by the interplay of loops b and r in the srbses model the increments of the tia link up these expectation formation mechanisms to the ecological deterioration of the basin this is how the srbses model allows us to trace some of the material consequences of a failing albeit prevalent water governance model founded upon the hydraulic paradigm in 2019 the regional government of murcia declared 14 inland and one coastal water bodies as vulnerable orden 23 de diciembre de 2019 due to a concentration of nitrates above the 50 mg l cap stipulated by the eu normative council directive 91 676 eec 1991 in 2020 the chs reported the existence of 23 groundwater bodies polluted with nitrates out of the 63 sampled across the basin garcía mariana 2020 of concern is not only that this type of groundwater pollution reappears in agriculture as e g groundwater becomes unsuitable for irrigation unless denitrified boe 148 2018 but also that nitrification contributes to the eutrophication of nearby wetlands steffen et al 2015 to elucidate the causal mechanisms underpinning these problematics in the segura river basin we successfully reproduced the readings of the ca07ni 44 hydrometric station located in the campo de cartagena chs 2022c via the simulated over growth of the tia intensive irrigated agriculture dominates the basin s landscape mosaic on account of the transferred and otherwise sourced water made available by the advent of the tst and the farmers capacity to artificially uphold profitable quantities of food exports with synthetic fertilisers pedreño et al 2022 nitrogen fertilisers are oftenest favoured for intensive farming as they promote the rapid growth of plants and encourage the unsullied development of foliage and fruits segura and pedreño 2006 foster and custodio 2019 further suggest that the rate at which nitrates in irrigation water infiltrate permeable soil profiles is slower than the rate of water table depletion attributable to excessive abstraction and that the accumulation of nitrates makes diffuse groundwater pollution a tangible threat to the basin we incorporate these considerations by connecting tia increments provoked by the interactions between loops b and r to the expansion of over fertilised areas inexpensive and soluble nitrogen fertilisers pollute both superficial and ground water bodies as the srbses model attests two of the most prominent consequences of these alterations in the nitrogen and phosphorus biogeochemical cycle s are the excess of nutrients of aquatic ecosystems eutrophication and the concomitant accumulation of phytoplankton paerl et al 2014 zhang et al 2004 this overgrowth is often conducive to algal blooms which reduce the amount of available oxygen and sunlight along any given water column eventuating in the death of other autotrophic and heterotrophic species from small crustaceans to fish eugercios silva et al 2017 le moal et al 2019 along the segura river basin these impacts are variously perceived as the eutrophic crisis of the mar menor lagoon álvarez rogel et al 2020 martinez fernandez et al 2014 the largest coastal water body in the western mediterranean and a biodiversity and tourism hotspot although a dedicated study of the mar menor ecological collapse is beyond the scope of this paper we would like to tersely outline the more recent events marking the timeline of the crisis ever since the early 2000 s scientists have denounced the anthropic origin of the lagoon s eutrophication 7 7 the increase of nitrates has been attributed to intensive irrigated agriculture while phosphates have been associated with wastewater coming from malfunctioning treatment plants between 1980 s and the 2000 and industrial pork farms more recently e g lloret et al 2005 martínez fernández esteve selma 2003 pérez ruzafa et al 2002 in 2016 algae finally tainted the mar menor green e g jimeno sáez et al 2020 martinez fernandez et al 2017 in 2019 and 2021 the algal bloom precipitated the mass die off of aquatic biota e g guerrero gómez et al 2022 the more than apparent links of these processes to intensive irrigation in the campo de cartagena derived in a series of conflicts between agriculture promotors and lagoon activists which has taken a new turn after legal personhood was granted to the mar menor in 2022 known as the ilp see vadillo 2022 the salinisation of the segura river is concurrent with the nitrification of the basin this is another environmental impact that the srbses model illustrates via r and b loop interactions see fig 3 as with the nutrient excess problematics the salinisation of the segura river is accounted for by successfully reproducing the behaviour of the se0912m063 hydrometric station chs 2022e our results in fig 6c indicate that even though the salinisation process seemed to have reached a plateau in the late 1990 s the current levels are not ecologically commendable these findings corroborate the work of estévez et al 2019 in showing that the salt build up along the segura river shifts from slight in the middle basin to heavy concentrations in the lower basin this is an alarming result for the salinisation of freshwater is directly linked to the deterioration of the inorganic nitrogen removal and carbon storage properties of aquatic environments as well as to increments in toxic sulphides which feedback the physiological stress in wetland biota initiated by the salinisation process itself herbert et al 2015 as pointed in section 3 the expansive trend of the tia has also had a sizable impact on the quality and quantity of abstracted groundwater driven by un checked expectations on water availability the regularisation of informal irrigation and the assimilation of pumping techniques all of them symptoms of the hydraulic paradigm which the b loop models farmers have historically tried to make up for the tst deficit with the abstraction of groundwater fig 6d the srbses model reproduces the growing reliance on aquifers over the last 50 years our results coincide with the overall trend identified in other works custodio et al 2016 rupérez moreno et al 2017 note that the latest official report i e the volume of abstracted groundwater in 2015 published by the chs is less than one standard deviation away from the srbses simulated value i e 207 hm3 year chs 2015 vs 280 5 hm3 year respectively as a contradistinctive qualification of our results let us also point to recent publications claiming that the tst project contributes to the replenishment of aquifers via infiltration and that the substitution of transferred water with irrigation water from more saline sources could accelerate the degradation of the basin s soils morote et al 2020 and morote et al 2017 these works are based on secondary literature mostly public policy documents and various ethnographic interventions with relevant stakeholders paradoxically we interpret such claims as illustrative or symptomatic of our diagnosis for the antecedents to their conclusions outline the expectation formation narrative conceptualised through loops r and b a closer look at our results show that aquifer overexploitation is largely coeval with the development of the tst project that is the overall trends of aquifer overexploitation fluctuate within the 10 hm3 and 40 hm3 in the early stages of the project and the 1995 and 2007 peaks of overexploitation follow the deflationary expectations triggered by concomitant but spurious hydraulic projects which made aquifers the more reliable if not the only source of irrigation water correlated with the expansion of intensively irrigated agriculture throughout the basin is the loss of drylands agro natural areas amounting to a loss of 333 100 ha by 2021 fig 6b habitat fragmentation due to land use changes has been identified as one of the main causes of terrestrial biodiversity loss globally haddad et al 2015 hanski 2015 in south east spain this phenomenon is a threat to the conservation of semiarid and arid ecosystems peñas et al 2011 even in protected sites martínez fernández and esteve selma 2004b several works have been continually reporting the severe effects of habitat loss of protected and endangered ibero african species such as periploca angustifol vegetal endemism and testudo graeca terrestrial tortoise martinez fernandez et al 2021 as well as a continuous decay of steppe birds populations e g chersophilus duponti tetrax tetrax pterocles orientalis and burhinus oedicnemus caballero et al 1996 esteve selma 2006 esteve selma et al 1995 we interpret the results of the srbses model as evidence of the continual deterioration of the basin due to iterative cycles of unrevised expectations on the amount of available water for irrigation and to the coextensive loops of reinforcing institutional leniency these findings suggest three main avenues of future research namely a critical assessment of the hydraulic mission via the srbses a supersystem extension of the srbses and its prospective refunctioning furthering the critical insight of the srbses model requires taking a closer look at its core feedback mechanisms under a more historiographic rendition of the prevalent water governance lineaments as our results show the interrelation between the b and r loops not only explain the growth of the tst irrigated areas but also reflect the shortcomings of the spanish hydraulic mission this prefigures a site to expand our understanding of the identified loops in the unfolding of similar socio ecological problematics in the region such as those raised by the ebro transfer and private desalinisation plants a larger segura basin ses model can be produced by augmenting the model with other subsystems in particular it would be fruitful to couple the srbses model with spatial modelling techniques to explore the interplay between aquifers precipitation and agricultural practices these efforts could give a better account of the uncertainties associated with our findings and contribute to a more informed understanding of the basin s superficial ground water dynamics e g explicating the observed fluctuations of nitrates in groundwater which the current version of the srbses model correctly approximates in the aggregate see section 4 finally in the face of new regulations aiming at reducing the amount of transferred water cht 2022 exploring the prospective and predictive potential of the srbses model is an imperative the model s explanatory capacity can be strengthened by including individual stakeholders e g reworking the srbses as an agent based model to elucidate alternative lower level responses of the system to the adoption of new water governance lineaments e g the modelling of the occurrence of the ilp this would require a revision of the chs s role s as well as the explicit recognition of the interactions between agriculture and water governance entities substantiated in decentralised decision making and coordination structures we anticipate also drawing evidence from the literature see oliveira et al 2022 pahl wostl 2019 that these exploratory reflections around the srbses model hold a transformative potential of the current paradigm towards a collective approach to water governance 6 conclusions the degradation of the segura river basin is one of the many manifestations of the prevalent sectoral infrastructure oriented approach to water and agriculture governance this approach is consistent with the praxis and narratives of the hydraulic mission an ideology of technological and economic development based on the domination of nature through the control and exploitation of water ecosystems molle et al 2009 in a quite explicit fashion the hydraulic mission s precepts in spain have incarnated into what is locally termed the hydraulic paradigm our research simulated the reverberations of the paradigm s pervasiveness in terms of the excessive expansion of irrigated agriculture and its impacts on the semiarid and riverine ecosystems proper to the basin our systems theoretic i e ses approach is conducive to an explicit modelling of the socio ecological feedbacks explicating the structural and functional changes configuring the basin s deterioration which we consider informative for the water governance of the basin our results show that the expectations on new hydraulic projects and the regularisation of informal water uses even if just nominally exceeded the total irrigated area in the basin in the early 1970 s and the late 1990 s to unsustainable but persistent levels of water requirements we characterise these events as a self reinforcing tst water demand extraction mechanism leading to the expansion of intensive agriculture r loop and as an institutional feedback loop portraying the chs s leniency in fulfilling its role b loop the two loops are at the core of our srbses model see section 3 explaining the behaviour of the total irrigated area over the last 50 years reaching 427 000 ha for 2021 and the extent of the associated environmental impacts according to the model nitrates in groundwater range from almost nil to over 200 mg l for 2021 while overexploited in 500 hm3 for the same year the hydraulic conductivity at 20ºc reaches a plateau at 2690µs cm in the mid 90 s and the loss of drylands agro natural landscapes to irrigated agriculture added up to 333 100 ha by 2021 the srbses model demonstrates that the socio ecological deterioration of the segura basin is acute and calls for a profound change in the way water governance lineaments are conceived and effected drawing on our results we argue that a long term system s perspective on the inapparent behavioural links between irrigated agriculture and institutional performance could counteract the socio ecological deterioration of the basin a key leverage point in the articulation of this new perspective is concerned with the role of the chs the chs could reshape its monitoring and controlling passive mission into an active praxis of waterscape transformation conscious of the influence it exerts on water abstractor groups who anticipate the chs s directives thus oriented we foresee that the role of the public may also change towards the creation of distinct spaces of engagement coordination and hopefully cooperation where the governance of the basin becomes an instance of collective transformation credit authorship contribution statement paula andrea zuluaga guerra data

scenarios the expectations on transferred water for irrigation are ineffectual fig b1 a there is no increase in tst planned areas fig b1b unplanned tst areas are not regularised fig b1c there is no increase in either planned or unplanned tst areas fig b1d and neither the tst nor the ebro transfer are deemed impactful fig b1e for these five scenarios the reality check index value was of 0 0029 and the closeness score is 100 on 5 measurements 2 sensitivity analysis the parametric coherence of the srbses model was corroborated through a two stage sensitivity analysis in the spirit of schouten et al 2012 comprising a one at a time assessment of threshold limit values oat and monte carlo simulations mc ranging over a wider spectrum the sensitivity index t i j of the target variable i to changes in the parameter j is calculated as follows jørgensen and fath 2011 b9 t i j o m i t o m i t o b i t p m j p m j p b j 100 where j o m i t and o m i t are the maximum and minimum values of the target variable i at time t o b i t represents the base default model value of the target variable i at time t p m j and p m j are the maximum and minimum values of the parameter j respectively and p b j is the initial value of the parameter j the range of each parameter was set to move 20 around its default value ford 1990 taylor et al 2010 banos gonzalez et al 2018 suggest the parameters to be classified into five categories in accordance to insensitive t i j 0 low sensitivity t i j 10 moderate sensitivity 10 t i j 50 high sensitivity 50 t i j 100 and very high sensitivity t i j 100 for each target variable i the parameters showing high or very high sensitivity were selected for the general sensitivity analysis we use the latin hypercube method as the sampling technique upon which to run the mc hekimoglu et al 2010 ensuring an adequate exploration of the parameter space within a reasonable number of iterations ford and flynn 2005 i e 200 epochs per simulation the variation coefficient vc of each target variable was computed as b10 v c i t o m 95 i t o m 95 i t o i 100 where v c i t represents the relative variation of the target variable i respect to its mean value at time t using 95 confidence bounds ford and flynn 2005 o m 95 i t and o m 95 i t are the maximum and minimum values of the i target variable at time t using 95 confidence bound and o i is the mean value of the target variable i each target variable i was classified in one of the following three categories banos gonzalez et al 2018 low response v c i t 50 moderate response 50 v c i t 100 and high response v c i t 100 2 1 sensitivity analysis results the details of the oat results are shown in table b2 the sensitivity index was estimated for the 13 model parameters in relation with the 5 target variables most parameters show low to moderate sensitivity to the target variables the results of the mc for each target variable under the simultaneous variation of its sensitive parameters sensitive index 50 can be seen in figs b2 to b6 table b3 shows the results of the general sensitivity analysis only those parameters showing high or very high sensitivity as per the sensitivity index are used to compute the vc values the target variables present a low to moderate response to changes in the parameter values table b3 three out of the five target variables show a low response variation coefficient below 50 and the remaining but a moderate response variation coefficient between 50 and 100 andarzian b bannayan m steduto p mazraeh h barati m e barati m a rahnama a 2011
